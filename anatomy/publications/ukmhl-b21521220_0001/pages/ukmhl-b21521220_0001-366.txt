3 <4 Part VI. VESICULA FELLIS. ral flight, which may be feen through the neck on the out- fltle. where it fometimes appears like a fcrew, efpecially when the neck is filled with any fluid. This obfervation is owing to M Hcifter By flirting the neck and duel, we fee all thefe folds very diltinilly, elpecially when we examine them in clear water. When they are viewed in any other manner they eafily de- ceive us, being miftaken for true valves, becaufe of their tranfverle fituation. They may, however, in fome meafure, lupply the place of valves, by hindering the bile from run- ning too fall into the duodenum, and the contents of the duodenum from entering this dudl. The flructure of the biliary dudls appear to be entirely membranous, covered ex- ternally with a thick cellular fiubftance, and lined within by a kind of tunica villola, which is pierced with numerous hole.-, that make it appear like a fieve. Through thefe a mucous humour flows, to lave the dudts from the imprefiion of the bile. And the internal furface of all thefe biliary dudls, that is, of the ductus hepaticus, cyfticus,sand cholido- chus being examined through a microfcope in clear water, ap- pears to be nearly of the lame Itrudlure through their whole extent. The cyftic and hepatic duÂ£ls, do not, in their ordinary and natural fituation, reprelent the capital Greek Y, where they form the dudtus cholidochus. After the incurvation of the neck of the veficula, thefe two duels run very near each other, and they appear to be feparated only by railing up the liver to view them. The fame diforder happens in an inver- ted liver extra fitum ; for then the body of the liver fublides and is flattened, and thereby feparates the dufls ; whereas, in its true fituation, it is very much incurvated, and the dudls 4 \ very ne<m each other. The dudtus cholidochus appears rather to be a continua- tion of the duftus cyfticus, than the common trunk of that and

ii THE PERICRANIUM. Chap. I. the fpina dorfi, and is known by the name of medulla fpina- lis, being a continuation of the medulla oblongata. The meninges, or membranes, are two in number; one of which is very ftrong, and lies contiguous to the cranium ; the other is very thin, and immediately touches the brain. The firft is named dura mater, the lecond pia mater. This laft is again divided into two ; the external lamina being termed arachnoides, the internal retaining the common name of pia mater. We begin with thefe meninges. ยง I. Dura Mater. Situation in general. The dura mater inclofes the bra'n and all its appendages. It lines the infide of the cranium, and fupplies the place of an internal periofteum, being lpread in holes and deprefiions, and covering all the eminences in fuch a manner, as to prevent their being hurtful to the brain. Divifton. In deferibing the dura mater, we mull take no- tice, i. Of its compofition. 2. Its adhefions to the cra- nium. 3. Its folds or fepta. 4. Its productions, vefielsj and nerves. Compofition. The dura mater is compofed of one lamina ; although it may, by maceration, be divided into two or more. Its texture is very clofe and ftrong, appearing to be partly li- gamentous and partly tendinous. Adhefion. The dura mater flicks clofely to the cranium by a great number of filaments of the external furface, which enter the pores of the bones, almoft every where, but more particularly at the futures both above and below ; and by penetrating thtfe joints, they communicate with the ex- ternal periofteum. Thefe filaments are, for the moft part, fmall vcflels, which being broken in feparating the dura ma- ter

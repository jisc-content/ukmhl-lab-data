Secretion of'the Semen. % ' / The veflftls belonging to the parts of generation conftant- ly arile near tlie kidneys, altnoft in all kinds of animals; by which nature femes to have intended a double ulefulnefs in one organ, which might be able to dilcharge the urine and femen. The fituation of the parts of generation at the lower part of the trunk, and between the thighs, conduces much to cleanlinefs and to facilitate parturition. The femen mafculmum is firll formed in the tefticle; then repofited in the feminal velicles ; afterwards ejected from the penis into the uterus, where it renders the female ovum pro- lific : and therefore this mud be the order of our iniquiry in- to thefe particulars. The tellicle is defended by various integuments, and is compofed of various kinds of veffels and of nerves, as have been already deferibed. The blood, brought by a very flow motion through the fpermatic artery to the anterior fubftance of the teflicle, is there diflributed and conveyed into the feminiferous vefiels ; but we are ignorant of the manner by which the arteries communicate with thefe canals, the bundles of which form the whole fubftance of the tefticle. Thefe feminiferous vel- fels are exceedingly fmall, ferpentine, firm, folid, and have a verv fmall capacity in proportion to their membranes. They are colle&ed together, as has been delcribeJ above, and ter- i^inats in the vafa deferentia.

It receives alfo fiime fmall ramifications from the gaftrica major and mclenterica fuperior. 1 he pancreatic veins are ran i of the fplenica, one of the principal branches of the vena portae major or vehtralis. This vena lpienica runs likewiTe along the lower fide of the pancreas near the edge, in a (hallow depreffion formed in the fubllance of the gland. Thcfe veins anfwer to the arteries of the fame name ; and there are hkewife other fmall veins correfponding to the imall arteries, which are productions of the great rneferaica, &cc. The nerves of the pancreas come partly from the plexus heparicus, partly from the plexus iplenicus, and partly from the plexus melentericus fuperior; and it likewife receives fome from the flat ganglion or plexiform intertexture, men- tioned in the defeription of the nerves by the name of the, tranfverfe rope. Tiie pancreatic duct is not only double in fome fubje£ts, as has been Lid, but the collateral branches have communi- cations in form of iflands in feveral places within the body of the pancreas. The pancreatic juice, which is watery, infipid, thin, neither acid nor alkaline, is poured into the fame place into which the bile ddcharges itfeif The quantity of juice fecrcted by the pancreas is uncertain ; but it mult be very confidsrable, if we compare tire bulk or weight of it with that of the falival glands ; tt.an which it is three times larger, and feated in a warmer ph.ee. It is expelled by the iorce of the circu- lating blood, with an alternate preffure from the incumbent and furrounding vifeera ; as the liver, ftomach, fpleen, me- le teric and I, lenfc arteries, and the aorra. The great ufe- fulnefs of this gland may appear from its being found, not on- ly in man hut in ail animals : Nor is its ufe the lefs from the experiment which (hews that a great part of it may be cut out from a robult animal without occafioning death ; be- cause,

367 VESSELS of the LIVER. Chap. III. nerves of the plexus hepaticus, form altogether a large bundle before they enter the liver. The trunk of the hepatic vena portae is in the middle of this bundle; the hepatic arteries lie on the right and left Tides of this trunk; the nerves fur- round it on all Tides, and they communicate with the plexus mefentericus Tuperior. Afterwards, the firft branches of the arteries, nerves, and pori biliarii, leave the trunk of the great vein, and join in the fame manner the trunk of the fmall or hepatic vena por- tae, and its ramifications in the capfula Glifioni explained a- bove. All thefe branches of the vena portae, and of the arteries, nerves, and pori biliarii, accompany each other by ramifica- tions through the whole fubfiance of the liver, forming every where fmall fafciculi, in the fame manner as the large bundles were formed by their trunks. Each ramus of the vena por- tae, artery, nerve, and porus biliarus, has a proper vagina, and all the four have a common vagina diftinguiflied from the former cellular Tepta, which are only continuations of the vaginae of both kinds. The convex fide of the common cellular vagina is con- nefled quite round to the fubfiance of the liver by numerous filaments which arife from it, and which form the cellular fubfiance found between the glandular corpufcles. The con- cave fide produces the cellular fepta above mentioned. In this common vagina, the veflels, duffs, and nerves, are difpofed in (uch a manner, as that the rami of the vena portae chiefly fill the cavity of it, and lie in a lateral (filiation. The arterial ramus, and porus biliarus lie together on the fide of the vein, and the nerve is divided into feveral filaments, which run in between the veflels and duffs, and chiefly ac- company the artery and porous biliarius; the venae portae ha- ving by much the feweft. 1 The

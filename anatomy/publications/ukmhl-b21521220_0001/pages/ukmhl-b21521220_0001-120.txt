Part Vh THE NOSE, 113 bone. The openings of the maxillary fioufes are nearly op* polite to the upper edge of the offa malarum. The openings of the frontal Unities are more or Ids oppofite to and between the pulleys or rings of the mufculi trochleares ; and by thefe marks the fltuation of all the other parts may be determi- ned. \ The inferior portion of the external nofe is compofed of feveral cartilages, which are'commonly five in number, and nearly of a regular figure. The reft are only additional, fmaller, mere irregular, and the number of them more un- certain. Of the five ordinary cartilages, one is fituated in the middle, the other four laterally. The middle cartilage is the molt confiderable, and fupports the reft, being connec- ted immediately to the bony parts ; but the other four are connected to the middle cartilage, and to each other, by means of ligaments. The principal cartilage of the nofe confifts of three parts, one middle, and two lateral. The middie portion is a broad cartilaginous lamina, joined, by a kind of fymphyfis, to the anterior edge of the middle lamina of the os ethmoides, to the anterior edge of the vomer, and to the anterior part of the groove formed by the efta maxillaria, as far as the nafal fpir.es of thefe bones. This lamina completes the feptum mrium, and indeed foims its principal part. The lateral portions are. oblique and narrow, fuited to the correljponding parts of the bony arch- Where they join the middle lamina, a fuperficial groove is obfervable, which makes them fometimes appear like two diftinft pieces, feparated from the lamina, though they are really continuous. This ihallow groove terminates below by a fmall crifta. The lateral cartilages are two, on each fide of the inferior part of the lamina ; one anterior, the other pofterior. The two anterior cartilages are very much bent forward, and form what is called the tip of the nofe; the fipace between their in- curvated

jpx THE MOUTH, Part VI. the particles of the food her ween which it is included and confined. In this aÂ£I of maftication, the oily, aqueous, and faline parts of the food arc intermixed the one with the other ; the l'mell and tarte of different ingredients are loft in one, which, by the dilution of the faliue parts with faliva, renders the food favourable *, but fuch particles as are more volatile and penetrating, being diredfly abforbed by the bibu- lous vefiels of the tongue and checks, enter ftraight into the blood veffels and nerves, fo as to caufe an immediate recruit of the faculties. The motions which are neceffiry for turning round the food, applying it to the teeth, and conveying it through the different parts of the mouth in maftication, are performed by the tongue, cheeks, and lips. And firlt, the tongue being expanded fo as to form a fmali concavity in its back or furface, takes up the food, and conveys it to the parts for which it is defigned. At one time the tongue, rendered narrow by late- ral contraction, fearches every [rart of the mouth with its tip, and turns out the latent food into a heap on its common con- cavity. At another time, applying its extremity to the fore- teeth, and railing itfelf up fuccelfivdy, it draws from the ca- vity of the mouth the fl 1 ids or chewed aliments, and conveys them to the fauces or back part of the mouth behind the teeth. Thefe motions of the tongue are likewife governed by the mufcles and membranes inferted in the os hyoides ; and this bone being drawn down by its refpe&ive mufcles, depreffes the tongue, and alfo the lower jaw, if its mufcles be relaxed. Thefe mufcles are the fterno hyoidaeus, fterno thyroidaeus, hyo-thyroidaeus, thyro-pharyngaeus, and coraco- hyoidaeus. The other mufcles which elevate the os hyoides, together with the tongue, are the Jlylo glojfus, fufrained by a peculiar li. lament of the upper jaw. The Jlylo-hyoidaeus, and fecon <\ Jlylo- byoidacui

HEART, Part VI, 23* The left ventricle firft ceafes its motion ; then the auricle of that fide ; then the right ventricle ; after that the right auri- cle ; and, laft of all, *he pulmonary veins and venae cavae. Whatever motion is in the venae cavae, ought to be attributed to the auricle repelling the blood into both thefe veins, and which the heart, when dead, is not capable of receiving. Dr Haller believes that nothing more is requifire to produce the heartâ€™s motion than a continual ftimulus applied to a very irritable part. For, on the approach of death, the coldnefs of the limbs contra&s the veins, and drives the blood to the heart; the lungs, being impermeable for want of refpiration, tranfmit no blood to the cavities of the left fide; and the heart, after it is thoroughly emptied, remains at reft. The velocity of the blood, at its entrance into the aorta, and the force with which it is expelled from the heart, have been fubje&s of much controverfy; and different anatomifts have computed them differently. To determine the velocity, modern writers proceed on the following data. They fuppoCc that two ounces are expelled by each (yftole, that each fyftole is the third part of the whole pulfation, and is performed in healthy perfons in 5|r part of a minute, that the area of the aorta is 0.4187, of an inch, and that two ounces of blood oc- cupy a fpace of 3.318 cubic inches ; or, in other words, that a cylinder of blood, whofe folidity is 3.318 inches, and bafe 0.4187, is expelled by the heart in 2|_th part of a minute. Since the folidity of a cylinder is the product of the area of its bafe into the length, its length will be equal to the folidi- ty divided by the bafe; therefore, in this cafe, 3 318 divided by <4187 gives 7.9245 for the length which the blood runs in -t|T of a minute; that is, *48 feet 7 inches in a minute.' To determine the force, they fuppofe that the perpendicular jet from the heart is 7 feet 6 inches, and the area of the fur- face of the ventricle is 1 5 inches; thefe two numbers multi- plied give 1350 cubical inches, or 51 pounds of blood againft which

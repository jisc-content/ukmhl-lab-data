*95 PERITONEUM. Chap. nr. ยง I. Peritonaeum. Having carefully removed the mufcles of the abdomen, the firft thing we difcover is a very confiderable membranous covering, which adheres immediately to the inner furface of the mufculi tranfverfi, and of all the other parts of this ca- vity, and involves and inverts all the vifcera, as in a kind of bag. This membrane is named peritonaeum, from a Greek word, which Cgnifies to be fpread around. lhe peritonaeum, in general, is a membrane of a clofe texture, and yet very limber, and capable of a very great ex- tenfion ; after which it can recover itlelf, and be contracted ' to its ordinary fize, as we fee in pregnancy, droprtes, corpu- lency, and repletion. It may be looked upon as a Angle membrane, although it has been delcribed by many anatomifts as a duplicature of two diftinft membranous laminae. But, properly (peaking, the internal portion alone deferves the name of a membranous lamina, as being the main body of the peritonaeum. The external portion may properly enough be termed the cellular fuljlance of the peritonaeum. The inner fubftance of the peritonaeum is very fmooth and polilhed on that fide which is turned to the cavity and vifcera of the abdomen, and continually moiftened by a ferous fluid difeharged through almoft imperceptible pores. . Thefe pores may be feen by fpreading a portion of the pe- ritonaeum on the end of the finger, and then pulling it very tight on all (ides ; for then the pores are dilated, and final! drops may be oblerved to run from them, even without a microfcope. The fources of this fluid are chiefly from the exhalent vefl- fels. The whitifli corpufcles found in difeafed fubjefts are no %

t THE MOUTH, Part VI. ]y inflat with air. Small duels of the fame kind with what has now been mentioned, may be fuppofed to lie along the middle line or raphe of the arch of the palate, and along the alveolary edge, becaufe of fome fmall tubercles or points which appear there. This membrane, together with that of the pofterior nares, forms, by an uninterrupted continuation, the anterior and pofterior lurface of the foft portion of the palate, or velum palati, fo that the mufcular fafciculi of this portion lie in the duplicature of a glandular membrane. The velum or valvula palati, terminates below by a loofe floating edge, reprefenting an arch fituated tranfverfely above the balls or root of the tongue. The higkeft portion or top of this arch fuftains a fmall, foft, and irregularly conical glandular body, fixed by its balls to the arch, and its apex, which hangs down without adhering to any thing, is called uvula. On each fide of the uvula there are two mufcular half arches, called columnae Jepti palati. They are all joined to the uvula by their upper extremities, and difpofed in fuch a man- ner as that the lower extremities of the two which lie on the fame fide, are at a little diftance from each other, and fo as that one half arch is anterior, the other pofterior, an oblong triangular fpace being left between them, the apex of which is turned toward the balls of the uvula. The two half arches on one fide, by joining the like half arches on the other fide, form the entire arch of the edge of the feptum. The pofterior half arches run by their/ upper extremities, more direiftly toward the uvula than the anterior. The anterior half arches have a continuation with the fides of the bafis of the tongue, ancl the pofterior with the fides of the pharynx. At the lower part of the fpace left between the lateral half arches on the fame fide, two glands are titu- ated, termed amygdalae, which fhall be deferibed hereafter, ' together i

THE BRAIN, Part VL 54 The rebellum; infinuafe themfelves between the ftrata, always in- verted by the duplicature of the pia mater; and arc at length loft in both fubftances of the cerebellum. The two vertebral arteries afterwards turn toward each Other, for the moft part immediately under the pofterior edge of the great tranlverfe or femi-annular protuberance of the medulla oblongata, where they unite and form one com- mon trunk. This trunk paffes directly from behind forward, under the middle of the great protuberance, and partly in the middle groove of the convex furface of that protuberance, at the anterior edge of which it terminates. In its paflage through the groove, this trunk fends off fe- veral fmall branches on each fide, which furround tranfverfe- ly the lateral portions of the protuberance, and are partly lodged in the fmall lateral grooves of thefe portions. Thefe lateral branches are afterwards diftributed to the neighbour- ing parts of the cerebrum, cerebellum, and medulla oblon- gata. This common or middle trunk of the vertebral arteries having reached the edge of the great protuberance, is again divided into fmall branches; each of which foon communi- cates with the trunk of the internal carotid on the fame fide. Inftead of this bifurcation, each of the two laft, or more an- terior lateral branches, fometimes fend a fmall branch for- ward, which form anaftomofes with the internal carotids. The principal arteries of the medulla fpinalis, called com- monly arteriaefpinales> are two in number, one anterior, and one pofterior, lodged in the grooves by which the medulla is divided into lateral portions on both fides. They arife from the vertebral arteries, a little above the great occipital foramen, where thefe arteries each fend a fmall ramus down- ward, as foon as they enter the cranium ; and having got under the extremity of the medulla oblongata, they fend off' two other branches backward.

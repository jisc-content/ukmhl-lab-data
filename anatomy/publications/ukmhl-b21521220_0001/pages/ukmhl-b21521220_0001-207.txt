Chap. II. PLEURAE and MEDIASTINUM. *0; Sabatier obferves that this is rare ; but he has likewife met â– with feveral examples, where an inftrument thruft through the middle of the fternum got into the left cavity of the thorax : And he has lomctimes feen the right lamina of the mediafti- nura fixed to the middle of the fternum, while the left one was fixed oppofite to the articulation with the cartilages of the ribs; a fpace being left between the two, which was filled with cellular fubftance, intermixed with fat. Prom hence we may judge of the uncertainty of trepanning the fternum, which the antients have recommended in fome cafes of ab- feefles, &.c. between the layers of the mediaftinum. The pleura is connected to the membranous portion of the fternum, ribs, and mufdes ; to the diaphragm, pericardium, thymus, and veflels; and, in a word, to whatever lies near its convex fide. The furface of the pleura turned to the cavities of the breafi: is continually moiftened by a lymphatic ferofity which tranfudes through the pores of the membranous portion. This fluid is faid to be fccreted by imperceptible glands; but the exiftence of thefe glands has not been hitherto demon- ftrated. Arteries and veins. The arteries and veins of the pleura are chiefly ramifications of the intercoftales; and thefe rami- fications are exceedingly numerous, and for the mod: part very fmall. The mammariae internae and diaphragmaticae like- wiie fend branches hither, which communicate very frequent- ly with thofe that come from the intercoftals. The mediaftinum has particular veflels, called arteriae and venae medinjlinae, which are commonly branches of the fub- claviae. The mammariae internae feud likewife ramifications to the fore-part of it, the diaphragmaticae to the lower part, and the .intercoftales and oefophageae to the back-part. Nerves. The nerves, which are few, are ramifications of the true intercodales. Near the vertebrae they communicate with

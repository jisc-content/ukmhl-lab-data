Part VI. 294 Of the ABDOMEN. ner, as we difcover by differing the fkin from the mufcles ; for then there appears on the inner furface of the membrana adipofa a longitudinal line like a kind of raphe, produced by the meeting of the cellular rows, which form angles fuccef- fively, one above another, oppofite to the linea alba of the abdomen. The cells in thefe rows are more oblong than the reft, and in a manner oval, or like a grain of wheat. Cavity of the abdomen. The appendix enfiformis of the fternum, the cartilaginous portions of the laft pair of true ribs, thofe of the firft four pairs of falfe ribs, all the fifth pair, the five lumbar vertebrae, the ofla innominata, the os facrum, and os coccygis, form the bony fides of the cavity of the ab- domen. The diaphragm, the mufculi abdominis, the quadrati lumborum, pfoai, iliaci, the mufcles of the coccyx, and of the intefmum reElum, form the chief part of the furface of this cavity ; and its whole inner furface is lined by a membranous expanfion, termed peritonaeum, all thefe parts being covered by the inte- guments already mentioned. As additional or auxiliary parts, we might likewife add iome portions of the facro lumbares, longiffimi dorli, vertebrales, glutaei, &c. The cavity of the abdomen is of an irregularly oval figure, but ft ill fymmetrical. On the forefide it is uniformly arched Â©r oval, and its greateft capacity is even with the naval and neareft part of the hypogaftrium. On the upper fide it is bounded by a portion of a vault, very much inclined. On the back-fide it is in a manner divided into two cavities by the jetting out of the vertebrae of the loins. On the lower fide it contrafts gradually all the way to what I call the little edge of the pelvis ; and from thence expands again a little as far as the os coccygis, and tubercles of the ifehium, terminat- ing in the void fpace between thefe three parts.

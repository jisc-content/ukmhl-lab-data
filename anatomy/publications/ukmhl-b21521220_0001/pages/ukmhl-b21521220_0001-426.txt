424 SPERMATIC VESSELS. Part VI. ' I * i tremities are at a diftance from each other, and their lower extremities are contiguous. They are irregularly round on the upper part, and their breadth decreales gradually from thencC. By the union of their lower extremities they form a kind of fork, the branch- es of which are broad, and bent like rams horns. Ihefe ex- tremities are very narrow, and form a fmall neck, which runs behind the bladder toward its orifice, and continues its - courfe in the groove of the proftrates, through the fubftance of the contiguous portion of the urethra, till its extremities pierce the caruncula in the manner already faid. The inner fubftance of the veficulae is plaited, and in a manner diftinguifhed into feveral capfulae by contorted folds. Their external furface is covered by a fine membrane, which ferves for a border and fraenum to the folds, and is a true continuation of the cellular fubftance of the peritonaeum. The veficulae may eafily be Unfolded, and all their contor- tions ftraightened ; and by this means they become much longer than in their natural ftate. Their inner furface is villous and glandular, and fomething fimilar to the inner furface of the gall-bladder, or like the cells of a honeycomb. This furnifties a partitular fluid, which exalts, refines, and perfe&s the femen, that the vefi- culae receive from the vafa deferentia, and of which they are the refervatories for a certain time. The paflage of the vafa deferentia into the veficulae is very particular. We have already obferved that thefe canals are incurvated behind the bladder, and that their contracted ex- tremities unite at that place, They unite in an angle, and run between the contiguous extremities of the veficulae; and this union is fo clofe, that the adhering portion feems to form only one middle feptum, between two fmall tubes; each of which is formed, partly by the extremity of one vas defe- rens, and partly by that of the neighbouring veficula. This

Such hard and tough foods as confift of long parallel fibres, or are covered with a bony fhell or cartilaginous fkin, generally require maftication to divide them into lefs coher- ing parts, that they may more eafily yield their nourilhment to the diffolving powers of the ftomach. I he more diligent- ly they are lubdivided in the mouth, the more relifhing ancl aereeable they become to the ftomach ; and the nearer they approach to the nature of a fluid, the more eatily are they digefted or aflimulared. Moll animals, therefore, are provided with teeth extremely hard ; and, as the materials of our food are various in their texture and firmnefs, nature has accordingly furnifhed us with, teeth varioufly figured. The office of the incifores is only, in the fofter foods, to cut thole which are tougher than the reft into fmaller portions; iuch as the fibres and membranes of animals and vegetables, with the brittle leeds and kernels of fruits. The canine teeth lacerate tough aliments, and hold fall fuch as require leng trituration by the grinders. Between the rnolares the moft compadt foods are interpo- fed and broke, the more tough and hard are ground fmaller, the lower teeth being urged obliquely and laterally againft the immoveable upper ones. Thele teeth are the principal inftruments of maftication ; and, that they might break or grind the food with due lire; grh and firmnefs, the upper- moft are fixed into the fockets of the immoveable upper jiw, as the lower ones are into the lower moveable jaw. This lower jaw is a Angle bone, and To joined with the temporal bones, that it ihay be drawn down from the upper jaw, and pulled up againft k with a great force ; and may be moved laterally

We may confider in each tellicle two extremities, two edges, and two Tides. One extremity is fituated forward and a little upward, the other backward, and a little downward ; and their edges lie up- ward and downward. At the upper edge they have each an appendix, called epi- dydimis, together with which it is involved in leveral cover- ings ; and they are both fulpended in the common covering, called the fcrotum. Each tellicle is a fpermatic gland formed by a vail num- ber of fine whitifh tubes, folded and twilled in different man- ners, and diftributed in different fafciculi, between membra- nous fepta ; the whole being furrounded by a llrong common covering, named tunica albuginea. Thefe fepta are difpofed longitudinally, divaricating from each other on one fide, arid approaching on the other. I hey approach each other along one edge of thd tellicle, and ter- minate in a long narrow whitilh body, as in a kind of axis. From thence they divaricate in a regular manner, and are fixed by their oppofite edges in the inner lurface of the tu- nica albuginea, of which they appear to be a continuation. This white body may be termed the nucleus of the tellicle, or by fome has got the name of corpus Highmorianum From this defcription we fee, that all thefe fepta are not of an equal breadth; that the interllices between them are in .fome meafure triangular ; and that the extent of the lmall tubes, which lie therein, mull be very confiderable. They have be^n reckoned to amount to many yards, by taking the fum of all their feveral portions ; and they may be eafily un- folded by a long maceration, which dellroys the delicate fub- fiance by which all their folds and convolutions are connefl- ed and tied down.

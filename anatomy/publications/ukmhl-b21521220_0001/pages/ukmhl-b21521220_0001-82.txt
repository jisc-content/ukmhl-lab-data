*o THE EYE, Part VI. Tunica choroides. The next coat of the globe of the eye is the choroides, which is of a blackifh colour, more or lei's inclined to red, and adheres, by means of a great number of fmall veffels to the fclerotica, from the infertion of the optic nerve all the way to the cornea, where it leaves the cir- cumference of the globe, and turns inward, to form a num- ber of little proceffes termed ciliary, which are fituated at the edge of the cryftalline lens. The external lamina of the choroides is ftronger than the internal, and is of a brownilh colour. At a very fmall dis- tance from the cornea this lamina is mod clofely united to the fclerotica, by means of a whitiCh ring called ciliary liga- ment or ciliary circle; and near the edge of the fclerotica this ring is ftronger, and of a different texture from what it is any where elfe. The choroides adheres fo clofely to the fclerotica, that if we blow through a fmall hole made in it, without touching the ohoroides, the air will penetrate every where between the two coats, but cannot deftroy this adhe- fion, or pafs to the cornea. On the inner lurface of this lamina we difeover a great number of flat lines in a vortical difpofition, which are the veffels named by Steno vafa vorti- cefa, or vortices vafculofi ; of which hereafter. The internal lamina of the choroides is thinner, and of a darker colour than the external; it is formed of a black varnifli, which is.thicker before than behind, and is wanting at the entrance of the optic nerve. At the fore-part of the eye it lies only between the ciliary proceffes, leaving them white, and adheres to the vitreous humour, forming there a radiated ring. The origin of this fubftance has not as yet been obferved •, but, after a nice ahatomical injection. Win- flow ha,s obferved a great number of valcular ftars on its in- ner furface. In Ruyfch’s works it is termed Membrana Rttyf- chiana. At

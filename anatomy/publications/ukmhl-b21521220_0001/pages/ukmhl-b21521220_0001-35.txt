33 AND ITS APPENDAGES. chp. r. § 4. Cettbellum. Situation and figure. The cerebellum is contained under the tranfverle feptum of the dura mater, in the under and back part of the cranium. It is broader laterally than on the fore or back tides, flatted on the upper tide, and gently in- clined both ways, anl’weraole to the ieptum, which lervcs it as a kind of tent or ceiling. On the lower tide it is rounder ; and on the back fide it is divided into two lobes, ieparated by the occipital feptum of the dura mater. StruBure. It coniifts, like the cerebrum, of two fubftances. It has no circumvolutions on its fin-face ; but, inilead of them numerous lulci, which a^e deep, and ddpofed m fuch a man- ner as to form thin flat firata, more or Ids horizontal, be- tween which the internal lamina of the pia mater mlihuutes itlelf by a number of lepta equm to that of the ltr.ita. Under the tranfverfe ieptum, it is coveted by a vafcular texture, which communitaus with the picxus choroidts. It has two middle eminences, called appendices vetmiformes; one anterior and fuperior, which is turned torward ; the other pofterior and inferior, which goes backward. 1 here are like- wife two lateral appendices, both turned outward. They are termed vermiformes, from their reiemblancc to a large poition of an earth-worm. Befides the divifion of the cerebellum into lateral portions, or into two lobes, each of thefe lobes ieerns to be hkewife fubdivided into three protuberances ; one anterior, one mid- dle or lateral, and one polterior : 1 hey are not, in ail fub- jeds, equally dillinguifhed either by their convexity or in, its; but they may always be diftinguifhed by the direction of their ftrata, thole of the middleftmd anterior protuberance being; lefs tranfverfe than the polterior.

Part VT. MESENTERIUM, &c. of tnefo-recium. This produdtion is very narrow, and about the middle of the fore fide of the redtum, it forms a tranf- verfe femicircular fold, which appears when the inteftine is empty, but is loft when it is filled. Between the laminae of the intfentery, a great number of glands lie fcattered through the cellular fubftance. In the natural ftate, thefe glands are fomething of the figure of len- tils or little round beans, fome of them being orbicular, o- thers oval, but all of them a little flatted, and in corpulent fubjedts we find them furrounded with fat. Thefe glands are of the number of thofe that anatomifts call glandulae cong!obatae> the ftrudture of which is not as yet, fufficiently known. They feem to be of a cellular fub- ftance, furrounded by a very fine membrane or coat, on which, by the help of microfcopes, we difcover an intertex- ture of particular filaments, which Malphigi believed â–  to be flefhy fibres. The niceft anatomical injections have not hitherto given us any iatisfadtion about thele particulars; for though they be made with all pcflxble care, they always fill the folliculous texture of thefe glands; and though, by means of thefe in- jedtions, Vve may difcover a great many vcfTels which were before invifible, we are not a whit the nearer our purpofe, be- caufe we cannot, by this method, diftinguifh the fecretory, excretory, and blood-veflels from each other. Befides the blood-veflels, which are diftributed in a reticu- lar manner in the mefenteric glands, and befides many ner- vous filaments fpread through them, we difcover an infinite number of fmall lymphatic veflels running from gland to gland. Thefe veflels are extremely thin and tranfparent, and fur- nilhed on the infide with numerous valves, which appear on the outfide like little fmall knots very near each other. They go out from each gland by ramifications, as by fo many roots;

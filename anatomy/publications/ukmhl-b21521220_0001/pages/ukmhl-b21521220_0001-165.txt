Chap. I. 163 AND ITS APPENDAGES. I ped up in capfules of this mucous body covered with the cuticle. Three forts of papillae may be diDinguifiied in the upper fide of the tongue ; capitatae, femi-l(enticulares, and viHolae. Thofe of the firfl: kind are the largeft, and are of a lenticu- lar form, having round heads with fhort ftems. They lie on the bails of the tongue in fmall fuperficial foffulae. They have a fmall deprefilon in the middle of their upper or convex fide, which opens into a mucous follicle. They occupy the whole furface of the balls of the tongue; and they are fituated near each other in fuch a manner as that the moll anterior form an angle. They are glandular papifc lae, or fmall falival or mucilaginous glands, of the fame kind with thofe that are to be defcribed hereafter. We commonly obferve about the middle of this part of the tongue a particular hole of different depths, the inner furface of which is entirely glandular, and filled with fmall papillae like thofe of the firfl: kind. It is called foramen caecum Morgagni, as being firfl; defcribed by that author. It is nothing elfe than the meeting of excretory duels of glands fituated in the tongue, and which throw out a thick laliva. The papillae of the lecond kind, or lemi-lenticulares, are fmall orbicular eminences, only a little convex, their circular edges not being feparate from the furface of the tongue. When we examine them in a found tongue with a good uii- crofeope, we find their convex fides full of fmall holes or pores, like the end of a thimble. They lie chiefly in the middle and anterior portions of the tongue, and are fometimes moll vifible on the edges. They appear to be very finooth and polilhed even to the naked eye, and they are often feen in living fubjefts. TJiey locn lofe their confiflence after death, fo that, by rubbing them fevcral times, they may be drawn out in form of lmall loft pyramids inclined to one fide. The

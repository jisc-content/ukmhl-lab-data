Secretion of Urine. The chyle, when it enters the blood, contains a very large portion of water, which would be liable to lodge in the cel- lular fubftance, if it was not expelled again from the body. A part of it is therefore exhaled through the Ikin ; and ano- ther part, as large, or often larger than the former, is (train- ed through the kidneys, and is thus expelled out of the body. Dr Halier obferved, â€œ that the blood of the renal arterv moving (lower, as is generally believed, than that of the brain, and probably ftored with more water, brought by the Terpentine circles of the arteries, drpofkes great part of its wa- ter into the rectilineal tubes of the papillae. This water con- tains fine oils and halts, intermixed with earthy particles, or foch other matters as are thin enough to pafs through with it. The fmall diameter of the origin of each uriniferous duCt, and-its firm refifhnce,Jfeems to exclude the thick oil, chyle, and the coagulable lymph ; but, asthcle uriniferous ducks are always open, if the velocity of the blood be increafed, or a morbid laxity of the parts fupervenes, they eafily tranfmit the above mentioned thick parts of the blood along with the thinner. The difeale hence arifing, is called diabetes, which may be cured by reftoring the kidneys to their former healthy Hate, by the tile of aftringents and tonics. The nerves have Come power of contracting or relaxing thefe paflages ; and thus we lee that urine, which, in health, is of a yellow colour, becomes watery from Hidden grief. A vaft: quantity of it is prepared ; equal to that of perforation, and lbnietimes even more." Later phyfiologrfts explain the fecretion of urine by Vol. II. 3 F oblcrving,

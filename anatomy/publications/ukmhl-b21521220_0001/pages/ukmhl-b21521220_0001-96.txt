THE EYE, Part VI. 54 The colour; and being tranfparent, the alubginea makes it appear perfectly white : Thefe two coats together forming what is called the -white of the eye. The greateft part of the numerous veflels which run upon it contain naturally only the ferous part of the blood, and confequently are not difcoverable, except by anatomical inje&ions, inflammations, obftruttions, &c. With the point of a good knife we continue the repa- ration of this membrane over the cornea. Glaiidula lacrymalis. The lacrymal gland, the ufe of which, till of late years, was not known, is yellowifh, and of the number of thofe called conglomerate glands. It lies under that depreflion obfervable in the arch of the orbit near the temples mentioned in the defcription of the fkeleton, and laterally above the globe of the eye. It is a little flatted, and divided, as it were, into two lobes; one of which lies to- ward the infertion of the mufculus levator, the other toward - the abductor. It adheres very clofely to the fat which fur- rounds the mufcles and pofterior convexity of the eye, and it was formerly named glaiidula innominata. From this gland feveral fmall duffs go out, which run down almofl: parallel to each other, through the fubftance of the tunica interna or conjun&iva of the fuperior palpebra, and afterwards pierce it inwardly near the fuperior edge of the tarfus. Steno difcovered the excretory duffs of this gland upon the eye of an ox ; and they are painted by Bidloo 1661. In man, however, they are feen with more difficulty ; for, although defcribed by Winflow and Lieu- taud, they were unknown to later authors, as Morgagni, Zinn, and Haller, till Dr Monro, the prefent profefl'or, dif- covered and injeffed them before the year 1753. They are fix or feven in number, have no communication with each other, and open upon the inner flde of the upper eye-lid near the outer angle.

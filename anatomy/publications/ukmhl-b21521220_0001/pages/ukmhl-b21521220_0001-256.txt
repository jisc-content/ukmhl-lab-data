CIRCULATION' *54 Part VL That the blood pafies from the lcaft arteries into the leaft: veins, we are clearly taught by anatomical ivjeElion; where, by one arterial trunk, we ealily fill all the arteries a d veins, al- znoft throughout the whole body, provided the liquor be wa- tery, or very fluid, fo as to pafs eafiiy into the vefTels of the head, mefentery, heart, and lungs. Laiily, the microfcopt has put the matter beyond all doubt ; in the pellucid tails, feet, and melenteries, of animals, we fee that the blood, brought to the extreme parts by the ar- teries, is poured either into fmall veins continuous with the reflc&ed artery, or elfe goes through branches of the arterial trunk into the parallel â€¢ommunicating vein, by which it goes on to the parts neareft the heart. This is the way in which the blood pafies, as well into the leaft veins which are capable of receiving only one globule, as into thofe that arc fomewhat larger, and are able to admit two or more globules to ad- vance forward together. That there is no lpongy or paren- chymous interpolition between the arteries and veins, in the general courfe of the circulation, is proved both from micro- icopic obfervations and injections. For, if there were any fuch parenchyma or fpongy mafs between the arteries and- veins, the hardening injeClions would fhew it, by appearing extravafated in an unfhapen mafs. The circulation of the blood is therefore now received by every one as a medical truth; namely, that all the blood of the human body is carried through the aorta, from the left cavity of the heart, to the extreme pares or converging ends of the arterial branches; from whence the whole trials is a- gain tranfmitted into the leaft veins, which convey it to tho larger, and from them into the cava and heart itfelf; in which courfe it perpetually goes and returns during life. Yet there are not wanting fome infLnces where, by pafi- fions of the mind, by copious blood-letting, or convul- sions, the blood has been forced to recede back from the fmallcr

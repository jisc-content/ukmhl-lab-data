VENTRICULU9. Chap. III. goi adhere to the fame half of this divilion, as we would be apt to imagine according to the common notion ; but that the diaphragmatic orifice is entirely in the upper halt, and the inteltnial orifice in the lower. 1 hcreiore the body of the ftomach is fo far from lying in the lame plane with the befophagus, as it is commonly repre- fented in ligures drawn from a tlomach taken out of the bo- dy, and laid upon a table, that it forms an angle or fold im- mediately at the pafiage of the oeloph igus, through the imall mulcle of the diaphragm ; and it is on account of this angle that the luperior orifice is turned backward. Structure oj the ftomach. 1 he itomach is compofed of fe- veral parts * the cruel of which are the different ltrata which form its fubliance, to which anatomifts give the name of tunicae or coats. Thefe coats are commonly reckoned to be four in number ; the outer or common, the flelhy or mulcu- lar, the nervous or aponeurotic, and the viiious or inner coat; and thev are afterwards JuhdiVided leveral ways. The fir ft or outermoft coat is dimply membranous, being one of the internal productions of the peritonaeum, ihis ap- pears evidently at the connection of the luperior orifice with the diaphragm, where the external tnembiane of the ftomach is really continuous with the membrane which lines the infe- rior furface of the diaphragm ; and it is from this that it has been named the common coat. The fecond or mul'cular coat is made up of feveral planes of fibres, which may all be reduced to two ; one external, the other internal. The external coat is longitudinal, though, in different refpeCts, following nearly the direction of the curva- tures and convexities of the ftomach; and the internal plane is tranfverlely circular. The fibres of the external plane run Hunting in feveral places ; and are interfered bf ftnall oblique whitifli lines, -which feem to be in fome meafure tendinous. This plane is ftrengthensd

The two pofterior cartilages form the alae of the nares, being pretty broad, and of an irregular figUir. The fpaces left between iome portions of the anterior and pofterior cartilages, thole between the polterior cartilages and the neighbouring parts of the offa maxillaria, and Lilly thole between thele four lateral cartilages and the principal lamina, vary in different fubjcdls, and are filled by frnall additional camLges, the number, fizc, and figure of which, are as va- rious as the interfaces in which they lie. The iub-leptum, or portion under the i'eptum narium, is a pillar of fat applied to the interior edge of the cartilaginous partition, in form of a iolt moveable appendix, The thick- nels of the alae narium, and clpccially that of their lower edges, is not owing to the cartilages, which are very thin, _ but to the fame kind of folid fat with which thele cartilages are covered. The great cartilage is immoveable, by realon of its firm conntdhon to the bony parts of the nole ; but the lateral cartilages aie moveable, becaule of their ligamentous connedtions, in different manners, by the mulcles belonging to them. The external nofe is covered by the common integuments, the ikin, epidermis, and fat. I he parts which cover the tip of the nofe and alae narium, are pierced with the duffs of a great number of glandulae febaceae, the contents of which may eafily be fqueezed cut by the fingers. All thefe bony and cartilaginous parts have iikewife the common perioftcum or perichondrium. Mufchs cf the nofe. Six mufcles arc commonly reckoned to belong to the nofe ; two levatores, two depreffores, and two compreffores. In very mufcular bodies, there are like- wife lome fupernumerary mulcles, or fmaller accefforii. The aiofe may alfo be moved, in forne meafure, by the neighbour- ing

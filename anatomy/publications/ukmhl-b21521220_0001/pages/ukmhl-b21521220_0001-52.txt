50 THE BRAIN, Part VI. ropes, called by anatomifts cauda equina, beenufe of fome re- femblance which it bears to a horfeâ€™s tail, efpecially when ta- ken out of the canal, and extended in clear water. Though the medulla fpinalis ends at the firft vertebra of the loins, the vagina of the dura mater, by which it is invert- ed, is continued through the reft of the bony canal all the way to the extremity of the os facruin, and involves the great bundle or cauda equina, the cords of which pierce it on each fide nearly oppofite to the places where they pafs through the intervertebral holes, and the anterior holes of the os fa- crum, almoft in the fame manner as was faid above in deferib- ing the general formation of the vertebral nerves. After this vagina of the dura mater is detached from the fpinal canal, by cutting the tranfverfe branches which go out of the intervertebral holes, it appears to have evident marks of elafticity, for it immediately fhrinks up, as an artery or other elaftic firing would do, when cut acrofs. Therefore its true length muft be taken while it is in fitu, and likewife the true fituation of the lateral elongations. From all this, a conclufion may be drawn, of great impor- tance, not only in anatomical and philofophical inquiries, but alfo for underftanding local difeafes, wounds, &c. which is, that, when we have occafion to confider any particular nerves near the vertebrae of the back or loins, or near the os facrum, we muft remember that, in the fpina dorfi, the origin of thefe nerves is not even with their paflage out of the fpine, but proportionably higher. If, for inftance, we enquire a- bout any of' the lowed nervi facri near the os coccygis, we muft not flop at the extremity of the os facrum, but trace its origin as high as the laft vertebra of the back, or firft of the loins. The membrana arachnoides accompanies the original fas- ciculi feparately, to their pafiage through the lateral elonga- tions of the dura mater, forming a kind of duplicature, breaks.

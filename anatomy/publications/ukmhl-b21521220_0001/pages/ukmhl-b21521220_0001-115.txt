Chap. I. AND ITS APPENDAGES. 113 AND ITS APPENDAGES. among prdbyopi, or old or long-fighted people, is from the diftance of fifteen inches to three feet. Such perfons are, in fome meafure, relieved by looking through a black tube held before the eye; by the ule of which the retina grows tenderer, and the rays come to the eye in a parallel direction. The remedy here is a convex lens, which caufes the rays to converge and unite together fooner in a focus, that it may not fall behind the eye, but upon the retina. The diameter of the fphere, of which fuch a lens ought to be a portion, is determined as before. There is no hope of relief from age, which increafes the malady. The medium between the fhort and long lighted eye is the beff, by which a perfon can fee diftinfUy enough objects that are both near and remote ; and of this kind we reckon an eye that is able to read diftinftly at the diltance of one foot. But a good eye requires other necelTary conditions, fuch as a perfect clearnefs of the humours ; a due mobility of the eye itfelf, and its parts; a fenfibility of the pupil, and a retina neither too prurient nor too callous. The mind only receives a reprefentation of the image of the objeft by the eye, impreffed on the retina, and transfer- red to the common fenfory or feat of the foul. Several cir- cumflances relative to vifion are not determined by the in- flrumentality of the eye, but are perceived by the mind from mere experience ; and fometimes the mind interprets the re- prefentation to be very different from that which the eye gives to her. The magnitude of an object, for inflattce, is not determined by the eye, but by the optical angle, which is formed by lines fuppoffed to be drawn from the extremities of the object to the cornea. Hence near objects feem large, and thofe at a diffance linall. On this circumftance alfo the power of microfcopes depends, which magnify in proportion to the difference between the focal length of the magnifier Voj-W- P and

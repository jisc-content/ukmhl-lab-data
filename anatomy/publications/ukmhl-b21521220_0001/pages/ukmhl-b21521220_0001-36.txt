THE BR AIN, Part VI. J 34 Fourth ventricle. When we feparate the two lateral por- tions or lobes, having firft: made a deep incifion, we difcover, hrft of all, the pofterior portion of the medulla oblongata, of which hereafter ; and, in the pofterior furface of this por- tion, from the tubercula fjuadrigemina, all the way to the pofterior notch in the body of the cerebellum, and a little be- low that notch, we obferve an oblong cavity, which is called the fourth ventricle ; this terminates backward, like the point of a writing pen. Hence the under end of it is called calamus fcriptorius. At the beginning of this cavity we meet with a thin me- dullary lamina, which is looked upon as a valve between that canal and the fourth ventricle. A little behind this lamina, the cavity grows wider towards both fidcs, and then contracts again to its firft fize. It is lined by a thin membrane, and feems often to be diftinguifhed into two lateral parts, by a kind of finall groove, from the valvular lamina to the point of the calamus fcriptorius. This membrane is a continuation of that part of the pia mater which lines the finall canal, the third ventricle, infun- dibulum, and the two great ventricles. To be able to fee the fourth ventricle in its natural ftate, in which it is narroweft, it muft be laid open while the cerebellum remains in the cra- nium i and, in order to that, the os occipitis muft be fawen very low down. On each fide of this ventricle, the medullary fubftance forms a trunk which expands itfelf in form of laminae through the cortical ftrata. But here we find the medullary bearing a lefs proportion to the cortical than.it does in the cerebrum. We difcover thefe medullary laminae according to their breadth, by cutting the cerebellum in dices almoft parallel to the balls of the cerebrum ; but, if we cut one lobe of the cerebellum vertically, the medullary fubftance will ap- pear to be difperfed in ramifications through the cortical fub- ftance,

Chap. I. AND ITS APPENDAGES. 93 channels, of which hereafier ; and the extremities of both cartilages are connected by a kind of fmall ligaments. Ligamenta tat forum lata. The broad ligaments of the tarfi. are membranous elongations, formed by the union of the periofteum of the orbits and pericranium along both edges of each orbit, The luperior ligament is broader than the in- ferior, and fixed to the fuperior edge of the upper cartilage, as the inferior is to the lower edge of the lower cartilage; fo that thefe ligaments and the tarfi, taken alone, or without the other parts, reprefent palpebrae. Membrana cotjunBiva. The membrana conjunctiva is a thin membrane, one portion of which lines the inner furface of the palpebrae, that is, of the tarfi and their bread liga- ments. At the edge of the orbit it has a fold, and is conti- nued from thence on the anterior half of the globe of the eye. adheing to the tunica albuginea; fo that the palpebrae and the fore-part of the globe of the eye arc covered by one and the lame membrane, which does not appear to be a con- tinuation of the pericranium, but has fome connexion with the broad ligaments of the tarfi. The name of conjunBiva is commonly given only to that part which covers the globe, the other being called fimply the internal membrane of the palpebrae ; but we may very well name the one membra ocitli conjunBiva, and the other mem- brana palpebrarum cotijunBiva. That of the palpebrae is a very fine membrane, adheres clofe to the palpebrae, and is full of fmall capillary biood-veflels. It is perforated by nu- merous imperceptible pores, through which a kind of ferum is continually difeharged ; and it has feveral very evident folds, which fhali be fpoken to hereafter. The conjunCtiva of the eye adheres by the intervention of a cellular fubftance ; and is confequently loofe, and as it were moveable; and it may be taken hold of, and feparnted in feveral places from the tendinous coat. It is of a whitifh colour j

VENTRICULUS. Chap. III. 2 99 whole ; but as we are here under no fuch neceffity ; we refer the defeription of thefe ligaments to other more proper places of this work. The venal ligament lhall be defenbed in the hiftory of the liver; and the two arterial ligaments, together with the urachus, which is the fourth, in the hiftory of the bladder. It is fufEcient to obferve here in general, that three of thefe umbilical ropes or ligaments are involved feparately, and fuftained by a production or duplicature, which the pe- ritonaeum fends into the cavity of the abdomen in form of a falx. ยง 2. Ventricuhs, Situation and figure ofi the fiomach. The ftomach is a great bag or refervoir, fituated partly in the left hypochondnuin, and partly in the epigaftrium. The figure of the fiomach is like that of a bag of a bag- pipe-, that is, it is oblong, incurvated, large, and capacious, at one end, and fmall and contracted at the other. We fee this figure moft evidently when the fiomach is moderately filled with air, or with any other fluid. The curvature of the ftomach gives us occafion to diftin- guiflh two arches in it; one large, which runs along the greateft convexity ; and one fmall, diretftly oppofite to the former. Thefe arches are named the great and fmall curva- tures of the ftomach ; and by the fides of the fiomach, we underftand the two lateral portions which lie between the two arches. The fiomach has two extremities, one large and one fmall. It has two openings, called the orifices of the fiomach ; one be- tween the great extremity and the favail curvature, the other at the end of the fmall or contracted extremity. The firft opening

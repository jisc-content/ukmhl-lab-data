Chap. I. AND ITS APPENDAGES. 185 Vol. II. A a tkl the greateft quantities of laliva; but there are a great number of other leficr glands of the lame kirn), which may be rec- koned affiilants or luolli'utes to the former. All thcle may be termed falival glands, and they may be enumerated in the following manner : Glandulae parotides, glandulae maxillnres, glandulae lublinguales, glandulae molar^s. glandulae buccaies, glandulae labiales, glandulae iii guales, amygdalae, glandulae palatinae, glandulae uvularcs, glandulae arytenoidaeae, gian- dula thyroidaea. The parotides are two large, whitifh glands, irregularly ob- long and protuberant, fituated on each tide, between the ex- ternal ear and the pofterior or afeending rarnus ot the lower jaw, and lying on fome part of the neighbouring mailcter mufcle. The fuperior portion of this gland lies before the * « • * cartilaginous meatus of the ear, and touches the apophyfis zygomatica of the os temporis; and it is extended forward and backward under the lobe of the ear, as far as the maltoid apophyfis. From the anterior and fuperior portion'of this gland, a white membranous duff or canal is produced by the union of a great number of fmall tubes reprefenting fo many roots. This duff runs obliquely forward on the outfide of the mai- feter; and then perforates the buccinator from without in- ward, oppofite to the interffice between the fecond and third dentes molares, where the hole or orifice reprelents the fpout of an ewer. This canal is named duElut falivolis Stenonis, or duElus fupe- nor. It is about the twelfth part of an inch in diameter, and on the out6r fide of tlie mafieter mufcle it receives lometimes one and fometimes two fmall dufl , from a like number of little glands, which Haller calls glandulae accejforiae. 1 he ex- ternal carotid artery and vein, and the portio dura of the le- venth pair of nerves, pafs through the fubftance of the paro-

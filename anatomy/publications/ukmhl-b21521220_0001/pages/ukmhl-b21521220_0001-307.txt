VENTRICULUS. 30$ Thefe two arterial arches fend a great number of branches towards each other on both fides of the ftomach ; and thefe branches are gradually ramified in different dire&i ns, by very different divifions and lub divifions ; the greateft part of which communicate with thole from the other artery. From thefe frequent ramifications and communications of the arterial arches of the ftomach, two d fferent reticular tex- tures arife ; one, which is the largeft, lies between the com- mon and mufcular coats in the cellular fubftances found there; the other, which is very fine, lies on the furface of the tunica nervofa. This latter is a production of the firft, being formed by means of a great number of very Ihort rami, which go out from the other, and pafs through the f nail in- terfaces between the fibres of the mufcular coat By artificial injections we can lhew~a third extremely fine reticular texture of capillary veffels, which run between the glandular bodies and papillae of the tunica villola. Thele do not feem, in their natural ftate. to be purely blood veffds, as inflammations and injections may incline us to think. The arteries of the flomach come originally from the cae- liaca, by means of the hepatica, fplenica, and coronaria. The pylorica and mefenterica luperior likewife contribute to them by communications, more or lefs in.mediate. They commu- nicate alfo with the mammariae internae, and diaphragmati- cae, and, by means of the epigartrica finftra, with the mefen- terica inferior. Veins of the Jlomach. The veins of the ftomach are ramifi- cations of the vena portae in general ; and in particular of the meferaica major, fplenica, and melenrerica interior ; the diftribution of which may be leen in the delcri jiion of the veins. They accompany the arteries more or lefs, and form nearly the fame kinds of arches and feticulat tex'ures ; with this difference, that they are proponionady greater, their re-

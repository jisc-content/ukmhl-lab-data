The fir ft portion of the urethra lies in this groove, adhering very clofely to the pro- bates, which (urround it for about half an inch in lenpth ; but there is only a very fmall pare of the probate upon the foreilae of this paffage. The body of the probates lies on the intebinum reftum, and the apex is under the internal labium of the cartilagi- nous arch of the oiTa pubis. The inner fubbance is fpongy, but very compatt ; and in each lobe there are feveral follicu- li, which open into the firft portion of the urethra, toward the bottom cf the groove, as we fliall fee hereafter. The fmall portion of the urethra, between the apex cf the pro- bates and the bulb, perforates a ligamentary fubbance, which is fituated at the under and back part of the fymphyfis pubis. This portion is very fhort, its length being no more than what is fufficient to pals through the hole in the ligament ; the poberior fide of which confequently touches the apex of ' the probates, and its forefide the bulb of the urethra. This portion might be called the neck of the urethra, and that which lies between the body of the bladder and the probates might be called the neck of the bladder. G/ans. The fpongy fubbance of the urethra having reach- ed the extremity of the corpora cavernofa, forms a large head called the glans, which crowns the three fpongy pillars ; with this difference,-however, that it is'a continuation of the fpongy fubbance of the urethra, and only adheres to the ex- tremity of the corpora cavernofa, without any direft commu- nication. It is for this reafon, that if we blow into the. fpongy fub- bance of the urethra, the glans is prefently inflated, and no air paffes into the corpora cavernofa ; but when we blow in. / ' * to one of thefe bodies, the air pafles immediately into the other, the urethra and glans remaining as they were.

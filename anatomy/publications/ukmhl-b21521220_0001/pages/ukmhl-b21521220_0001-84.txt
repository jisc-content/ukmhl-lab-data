Part VI, Si THE EYE, „ • / \ n The fpaee between the cornea and iris contains the great- eft part of the aqueous humour, and communicates by the pupilla with a very narrow fpaee behind the iris, or between that and the cryftalhne. Thefe two (paces have been term- ed '4he two chalmers of the aqueous humour. one anterior, the other pofterior, as we fliall oblerve in deferibing this humour In particular. Retina. The laft coat proper to the eve is of a very dif- ferent texture from that of'the other two coats. It is white, foft, and tender, and, in a manner, medullary, or like a kind of pafte fpread upon a fine reticular web; it lines the bot- tom of the eye, ant! is a continuation of the optic nerve. Some authors, as Zinu, affirm, that it terminates, at the cili- ary circle ; others, as D' Haller, reorelent the whole or a .part of it as extended to the iens, and even as giving a co- vering to that humour; but Ur monro observes, that it ends fome way behind the ciliary circle (See Oufiervations on the Nervous Syftem.) At the pHce which anlwers to the infer- tion of the optic nerve, *e oblerve a (mall deprtilion, in which lies a fort ot medullary button, terminating in a point; and from this depreffion blood vtfTels go out, which are ra- mified on all fides through the fubftance of the retina. It is commonly faid, that the retina is a production or ex- panfion of the medullary lubftance of the optic nerve, the fclerotica of the dura mater, and the choroides of the pia mater, which accompany this nerve; but this opinion is not altogether sgreeabie to what we obferve in examining the optic nerve, and its intertioq in the globe of the eye. If we take a very ffiarp inftrument, and divide this nerve through its whole length, between where it enters the orbit and where It enters the globe, into two equal lateral parts, and then con- tinue this feftion through the middle or center of its infec- tion. the following phenomena will appear; ' • Thstf

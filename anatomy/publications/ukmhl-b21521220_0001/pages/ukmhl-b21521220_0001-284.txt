232 RESPIRATION. Part VL mals, as in the locuft ; from our being able to extrifl air out of die blood and humour' of animals in vacuo ; from a ne- cefiity of a vital oiciliation in the blood ltfelf ■, and, laflly, from the jncrtafea redni is of the pulmonary blood ? But that no elaffic air is here received into the blood, ir demonftrated, from the impnffibility of forcing air into blood, if it retains its elailiciryi from the inutility of its reception, if the fpring of it fhould be loft in the blood , from the per- fect immutability of the blood by cold ; from the minutenefs of the inhaling vefiels ; from the mucus that perpetually lines the fides of the veficles in the lungs; from the nature of the daflic air itfelf, which is very unapt to pals through capillary vefiels *, from a repulfion of it by water, for it is hindered from palling through paper, linen cloth, or fkins, when they are wet. Again, the air taken in by the trachea never pufles to the heart ; or, whenever it does fo, it is forced thither by fome great or unnatural violence : But the permanent air in the Vefiels and humours of the human body, from a date of inelaflicity, may become elaltic by putrefaction, froft, or an'external vacuum. Such permanent unelaftic air is incor- porated with alj liquors, and taken into our ,bodies with the aliments, and with abforbed vapours, mixing flowly and with fome difficulty. But there never were any elaflic bubbles of air obferved in the blood of a living animal •, and fuch air being inflated into the blood vefiels of any living animal, certainly and fpeedily kills it. Laftly, though air, indeed, is abforbed by moft of our humours, yet that abforption is performed flowly, and fakes up the fpace of leveral days after the former air has been exhaufled by the pump. It then like- wife, lays slide its elaflic naiure; nor are there any reafons why the air ffiould 'either be more fpeedily abiorbed by the blood, or why it fliould retain its elafticify after it is fo abiorbed. “ If,

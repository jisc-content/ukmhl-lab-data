331 Chap. TIT. BLOOD-VESSELS. I The ftraight potttion of the arch of the colon, or that which is an immediate continuation of the caecum, is lup- plied with arteries by the fecond branch that comes from the concave fide of the mefenterica luperior, and likewite a little by the third, when there is a third. , Tht luperior or middle p -rtion of the arch of the colon, is furmthcd by the rirlt branch from tire fame fide of the melenterica luperior, which, by a bifurcation, communicates on both hands with the other portions of the arch of the colon. â€™lhe left portion of this arch derives its arteries partly from the tint branch of the lame niclent,erica, t\nd partly from tnat of the melenterica interior ; which two branches form the celebrated communication or common arch of the two mclemericae. By means of this communication or continuation, in cafe one artery Ihould be obltructed or comprefied, the other would furniih blood to all the branches below ihe place of the obftruction. The fecond branch ot the mefenterica infe- rior, gives likewife fmall arteries to the left extremity of the colon. The defeending convolutions of the colon which reprefent a Roman h, are fupplied by the other branches of the me- fenterica inferior, the lalt of which forms the haemorrhoida- lis interna. The veins of all thefe portions of the colon form trunks which terminate chiefly in the haemorrhoidalis interna or meiaraica minor an.l nnjor, and l'ikewiie in the vena portae ventralis. 'The diliribution of thefe branches and ramifica- tions is in fome mealure the lame with that of the arteries, as may be feen in the defcription of the veins. The arteries of the redlum are furnifiied by the haemorr- hoidabs interna, the lalt branch of the mefenterica inferior, which communicates with the hvpogallrica, and particularly with

AND ITS APPENDAGES. from the example of women, in which the larynx is fofter, but the voice more acute, than in men; from experiments which fhew, that more acute founds are produced by bring-, ing the ligaments of the glottis nearer into contact with each other; from the perfect want of machines, by which the liga- ments can be ftretched, and the fcutiform cartilage brought forward from the annular one. But, fince it appears from experiments, that a tenfion of the ligaments (uffices for pro- ducing acute founds, without the contraction of the glottis, we may believe that the different tenfion of the glottis con- tributes more to the diverfity of voice than the different dia- meter of it. Singing is when the voice, modulated through various de- grees of acutenefs and gravity, is expelled through the la- rynx, while it is trembling and fufpended between two con- trary powers; and herein lies the principal difference between the chanting of Ample notes and the expreflion of words. Hence finging appears to be a laborious aCtion, on account of the continual contractions of the muffles, which keep the larynx at an equilibrium ; and hence it is that finging makes a perfon hot; becaufe, in acute tones, the narrower glottis much retards the exfpiration, while at the fame time a great deal of air is required to give firength to the voice ; to which, again, deep inlpirations are neceffary. Hence likewife the trachea grows dry, from the quicker paffage or current of air y to prevent which, a great deal of mucus is required ; and therefore great numbers of mucous receptacles are found in the larynx ; among which the ventricles belore deferibed ought furely to be numbered. Speech is performed by the larynx at reft, or held in the fame place, with tones of voice differing but little in acute- nefs and gravity ; but then the voipe is varioufly changed or modulated by the organs of the mouth. Singing has a vari- ation in the tone or caden.ce of the voice, together with a modulation

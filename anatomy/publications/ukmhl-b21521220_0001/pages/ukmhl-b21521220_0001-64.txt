I ' THE BRAIN, part Vf, than blood ; although, in fome difeafes, and by ftrangling, they often, efpecially in brutes and birds, receive even the red parts of the blood. The remaining part of the cortex, which is not filled by any injedlion, is probably cither an af- femblage of veins, or of yet more tender veffels â€¢, for no dif- fimilar parts are apparent in the cortex, whilft it is in an en- tire or natural ftatei'and hence we are not permitted to con- clude that part of it is tubular, and part folid. As to glan- dules making the fabric of the brain, that notion has been difcarded by univerfal confent, as not being founded on the Zeaft probability. In order to gain a knowledge of the nature of the medulla, which lies under the cortex, we are to confider the anatomi- cal ftruclure of this part of the human brain, compared with the brains of brute animals and filh, This part of the brain, therefore, which lies immediately under the outer gyri or convolutions of the cortex, is of a white colour, and becomes gradually broader, and more abundant; fo that, at length, it makes up the whole oval feclion of the brain, except only the gyri in the circumference. The nerves of the brain, as well as of the fpinal marrow, divide into branches like the blood-veffels, but in acute an- gles, and often in a courfe manifeftly retrograde, they gene- rally, but not always, gradually become fofter, and lefs bulky, as they recede from the brain, till at length their ultimate extremities, which are feldom vifible, feem to terminate in a pulp, by depofiting the firm integuments with which they were covered, as we obferve in the optic nerve. The re&i- iineal courfe of the fibres, continued from the brain itfelf, is never broken off by the divifion or fplitting of a nerve in- to fmaller threads ; but the fibres themfelves recede from each other by an opening of the cellular fubftance that tied them together. This appears from the diforders which are determined not to all, but only to fome fingle parts of the . body*

Part VI. THE BRAIN. 12 ter from the fkull, caufe a great number of red points to ap- pear on the external furface of that membrane. It adheres much more to the whole inner furface of the cranium in children, and young perfons, than in thofe of an advanced age, when the filaments become very fmall, being compreffed by the contraction of the bony pores; and confe- quently they are more eafily ruptured, by any force applied to them. Thefe adhefions are formed entirely by the outer furface of this membrane, the inner part of it being very fmooth and poliflied, and continually moiflened, much in the fame man- ner as the peritonaeum and pleura are, by a fine fluid dif- charged through its pores. Folds and fepta. The dura mater fends off feveral procef- fes; three of which form particular fepta, that divide the brain into certain parts. One of them is fuperior, reprefent- ing a kind of mediaftinum between the two great lobes of the brain : The fecond is in a middle fituation like a diaphragm, between the cerebrum and cerebellum : The third is inferior, between the lobes of the cerebellum. The fuperior feptum is longitudinal, in form of a fcythe, whence it is termed the falx of the dura mater ; and it may likewife be called fep- tum fagittale, verticale, or mediafimim cerebri. The middle feptum is tranfverfe, and might be called the foor of the cere- brutiiy the diaphragm of the brainy tentorium cerebelii. The in- ferior feptum is very fmall, and runs down between the lobes of the cerebellum *, on which account it may be termed ei- ther limply feptum cerebelii, or feptum occipitale minus, the mid- dle partition being looked upon as the feptum occipitale ma- jus. The fuperior or vertical feptum, called the falx of the dura water, is a long and broad fold or duplicature of the internal part, reaching from the edge of the crifla galli, along the fagittal future, to the middle of the tranfverfe feptum j which

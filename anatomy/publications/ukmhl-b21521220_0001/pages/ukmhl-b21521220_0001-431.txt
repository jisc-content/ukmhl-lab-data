Chap, IV. PENIS. ' 42* becomes a cylindrical tube, and unites with the other in the manner already laid. The heads or rounded extremities join the balls of a difiinft body, called the gJans, which is an expanfion of the urethra, and clofely united to it in the manner that fhall be explained hereafter. By the union of the corpora cavcrnofa from their roots to their round extremities or heads, a particular feptum is form- ed by the tranfverle fibres of both. Between the fibres of this leptum feveral fmall void fpaces are left, by which the corpora cavernola communicate with each other ; and there- fore, by blowing into one of them, we prelently inflate the other. Toward the rounded extremities the feptum dimi- nilhes every way. Urethra. The urethra is the third fpongy tube which compotes the penis ; and it adheres to the corpora cavernofa, through the whole length of the inferior groove formed by their union. It diftl-rs from the other two, both as it is nar- rower, and as it forms a true hollow canal. Its lubftance is fpongy or cavernous, except a fmall portion next the bladder; and its inner and outer furfaces are membranous. It extends from the neck of the bladder to the extremity of the penis. It is at firfl no more than,a membranous canal continued from the anterior opening of the bladder, at the place called the neck of the bladder, which is a name that would be more proper for this portion of the urethra. It defeends from its origin to the under end of the fymphyfis pubis; then it a- feends before the fymphyfis to the root of the penis ; and at laft redefeends to the point of the glans. About a fingerâ€™s breadth from this part, it joins a cavernous fubflance like that of the two other tubes, only fmaller, which furrounds it through the whole extent of the inferior groove of the corpora cavernofa.

GLANDULE RENALES. Part VI. 4°4 the kidneys and glands, and alio between them and the dia- phragm ; fo that they adnere to both by the intervention of the cellular lubitance, which in lome fubje&s contains a ftra- tum of fat. The venal ridge already mentioned, finks fo deep into the fore-ii e in lome ubjedts, that the upper part of this fide ap. pears tu be leparateu from the lower ■, but this is feen molt dilimdtly when me ..aplula is examined in clear water. When he c plular vein is opened lengthvvife with the point of a lancet, we difeover in it a great many fmall holes, many ol which are only the orifices of the rami of the vein, others are limp'e holes ; and it is perhaps through thefe that the air pafles into the gland, as already mentioned. On the outer lurface of thefe capiulae we obferve a very thin, diftindf coat, leparated from the cellular fubftance that furrounds them. Sometimes this coat is railed by an uneven flratum of fat, which makes it appear granulated ; and, for the fame reafon, the capiulae are of a pale colour like a cor- pus adipofum. The liquor contained in them appears fometimes, in the foetus, and in young children, of a bluilh colour inclined to red. To be able to difeover the ufes of thefe capfulae, we muff not only a’tend to the two circumftances already mentioned, but alfo to their external conformation, which is commonly more regular in the foetus and in children than in adults and old people- We mull likewife confider the conlifience and folidity of their fubfiance *, which is greater before birth, and in childhood, than in adva, ced old age; in which they are often very flaccid, and very much decayed ; and this perhaps may be the realon why lome of the figures given of thefe glands, taken out of their membrana adipola, are fo very irre- gular and different from others.

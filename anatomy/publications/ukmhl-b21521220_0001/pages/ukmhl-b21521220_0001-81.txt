79 AND ITS APPENDAGES. Chap. I. diflance from the optic nerve ; and running thence obliquely through its fubflance, they pierce the concave fide near the cornea lucida. The cornea lucida, called alio (imply the cornea, confifts of feveral lfrata or laminae clolely united by cellular iubftance, and of a different texture from the former ; befides, it receives no blood-velfels in the natural ftate. When macerated in cold water it Iwells, and then its ftrata may be feparated from each other. If it be. macerated till it begin to become putrid, and is then plunged into boiling water, it readily leparates from the fclerotic, being joined only by cellular fublfance. (See Traire Complet. dâ€™Anatomiej. It is hkewile thicker than the fclerotic, elpecially in new.born children, where its pofterior furface almoll touches the iris. This portion is foinething more convex than the fclerotica, fo that it reprefents the fegment of a fmall fphere added to the fegment of a greater; but this difference is not equally great in all perfons. The circumference of the convex fide * is not circular as that of the concave fide, but tranfverfely oval: For the fuperior and inferior portions of the circum- ference terminate obliquely ; but this obliquity is more appa- rent in oxen and (heep than in man. The cornea is perforated by a great number of impercep- tible pores, through which a-very fihe fluid is continually dif. changed, which foon afterwards evaporates; but we difco- ver it evidently by prcffing the eye foon after death, having firft wiped it very clean ; for we then fee a gradual collec- tion of a very fubtle liquor, which forms itfelf into.little drops ; and this experiment may be feveral times repeated on the fame fubjeff. It is this dew that forms a kind of pellicle on the eyes of dying perfons, which fometimes cracks foon after, as is obferved in the Memoires of the Academy for 1721. 1 !Tunica

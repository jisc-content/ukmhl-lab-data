The other two openipgs in the true fundus of the bladder, are formed by the ureters, which in their courfe downward, already defcribed, run behind the fpermatic veflcls, and then behind the lower part of the bladder, approaching each other. Each ureter lies between the umbilical artery and vas defe- rens of the fame fide ; the artery lying on the outfide of the ureter, and the vas deferens on the infide. Afterwards they get between the vala deferentid and the bladder, eroding thefe cana.r ; aud then, at about a finger’s breadth front each other, they begin to pierce the coats of the bladder. They run a little way between the mufcular and nervous coats, and open into the bladder obliquely, fome- thing nearer each other than when they firft entered the coats. The orifices of the ureters in the bladder are fomething oval, and narrower than the cavity of the ureters immediate- ly above them. The edge of thele orifices is very thin, and f'eems to be formed merely by the umcn of the internal coat of the bladder with that of the ureters. Blood veffels and nerves of the bladder. The arteries of the bladder are furnifhed by the hypogaffricae or iliacae internae, being rami of the arteria fciatica, epigaftrica, and umbilicalis ^ • / • on each fide. The veins return to the internal iliac veins. The nerves of the bladder come from the crurales, and al- fo from the fympathetici maximi, by means of their commu- nication with the crurales. It has likewife fome nerves from the plexus mefentericus inferior. Befides the ligaments already mentioned, there are like- wife two (mall ones, by which the anterior part of the true fundus i f the bladder is connected to the ofia pubis, which ihail be dclcribed with the neck and fphm£ter, after the hif- tory

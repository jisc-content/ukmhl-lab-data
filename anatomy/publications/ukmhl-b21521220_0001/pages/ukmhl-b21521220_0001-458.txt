456' UNIMPREGNATED UTERUS. Part VI. f \ Circulus membranofus. The exterior or anterior extremity of the great canal in virgins, and elpecially before the firft eruption of the naenfes, is commonly bordered by circular membranous folds of different breadths, more or lei's fmooth, and fometimes femilunar ; which, in fome fubjedls, leaves but a very fmall opening, in others a larger opening ; and, in all, renders the external orifice narrower than the reft of the cavity. This fold, called hymen, is formed by the union of the internal membrane of the great canal with that on the infide of the alae, and reprefents a membranous circle of different breadths, and fometimes uneven. Caruticulae. This membranous circle is commonly ruptu- red after the confummation of marriage *, is quite loft in de- livery, and afterwards only fome irregular portions of it re- main ; which, from their fuppofed refemblance to myrtle- leaves, have been termed carunculae myrtifermes. This circle may likewife fuffer fome diforder by too great a flux of the inenfes, by imprudence, levity, and other particular acci- dents. Plexus retiformis. Each fide of the anterior portion of the, great canal is covered exteriorly by a thin, broad, cavernous, and vafcular plexus, called the plexus retiformis of that canal. Thefe two planes run down on each fide of the clitoris be- hind the nymphae, and likewife cover the urethra like a col- lar, before they are fpre.ad on the great canal. This plexus is ftrictly united to the mufcular portions, commonly taken for accelerators or conftriftors, lying between thefe portions and the lateral parts of the urethra, and of the great canal. This plexus may be inflated by air like a flaccid fpleen, or like the fpongy fubftance of the clitoris, with which it feems to have fome communication ; and on this account the late- ral portions of this reticular plexus have been named the in- tcrnal crura of the clitoris It is a kind of rete-mirabile, â–  compofed

Chap. it. 251 OF THE BLOOD. Â«afe; as when fame tumour, by compreflure or an aneurifm, intercepts the blood's motion from the heart. Experiments of this kind have been made on moft of the arteries; anaf. tomofes, however, or the blood flowing through a neighbour- ing branch, or tlie retroccffion of the blood in a dying ani- mal, form exceptions to thn rule. But the courfe or motion of the venous blood, has been always more doubted; aim oft all the antients have been perlaudcd, that the blood in the veins flowed through them, either from the heart or from the liver, to all parts of the body. Very lew of them have known that this was an error. Several of them have, indeed, acknowledged it to be falfe in the pulmonary vein. But that the blood did not move from the heart in the vena cava was known to ftill fewer anaromifts of the ancients: Only to Andreas Caefal- pinus by chance, and (from an extraordinary accident) to Ve- falius. Dr. William Harvey was the firft who experimentally afl. fcrted the motion of the blood returning in the veins to the heart, in fuch a manner as to render the whole intelligible, and leave no room for doubt. The valves of the veins lead us to this truth; For the common uie or office of thefe valves is, to determine the preflure that is made from any quarter upon the veins, towards the heart, by allowing no opportunity to the venous blood that has once entered the trunk to flow back to the. branches. For, Cnee the valves open upwards towards the heart, the blood enters and expanos them; and thofc parts of the valves which projedt into the cavity of the vein, approach towards the axis, until the oppoflte fides, by meeting together, (hut up the tube. This we know from inflations, ligatures, and injections of the veins ; for you never can force a liquor eaCly into the veins by propel- ling it againft their valves. They do not, indeed, every where

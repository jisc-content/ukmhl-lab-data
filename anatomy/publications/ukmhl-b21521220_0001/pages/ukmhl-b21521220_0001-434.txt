43* Part VI. PENIS. i The inner furface of the praeputium is lined with a fine 1 membrane from theâ€™ opening all the way behind the balls of the glans, and the fame membrane is folded from behind, forward, round the glans, forming the proper integument of it, and covering very clofely its whole villous furface, as far as the orifice of the urethra, where it joins the membrane which lines the inlide of that canal This proper membrane of the glans, and internal mem- brane of the praeputium, form conjointly along the flat part of the glans, from its bafis to the orifice of tne urethra, a membranous duplicature, which, like a leptum or mediafli- num, divides this part into two lateral portions, and limits the motions of the praeputium; for which reaion it is called fraenum praeput'u. The lurf.xe of the internal membrane of the praeputium difcharges a fluid which prtvents it from adhering to the glans, and perhaps lerves likewife to dilute that which is col- lected at the bafis of the glans, from the glandulae iebaceae, already mentioned, The lecond common integument of thefe parts is nearly thd fame with what is every where found under the Ikin, ex- cept that it is not filled with fat, and that it is more fibrous than cellular, and a little loofe. It accompanies the Ikin te the bafis of the glans,las has been already obferved. Ligamenlumfujpenforium. Tbe third common integument, improperly'called tunica nervofu, is of a firm, elaftic, ligamen- tary fubftance, and its fibres are fometirr.es of a yellowifh co- lour. It inverts the corpora cavernofa and urethra from the glans to the fymphyfis of the orta pubis; and, at fome diftancs from thefe hones, it forms on the fuperior groove of the cor- pora cavernofa a clofe duplicature ; and by this duplicature, a flat broad ligafnent which runs dire&Iy upward, and is in- ferted in the forementioned fymphyfis, as far as the tendi- nous bafis of the mufeuli pyramidales of the abdomen.

Part VI. iiS THE EAR, the power of particular antipathies : Hence alfo the perni- cious effedls of exceffive freezing, more efpecially in produ- cing blindnefs, which may, in fome meafure, alio be more cafily brought on by the confent of the nerves that are exceedingly numerous in tliefe neighbouring organs. Among the various parts of the nofe, the feptuin, and more efpecially the os tur- binatum, have a confiderable frare in the organ of fmelling, fince thefe parts are multiplied in quick feented animals. In clogs, and other quadrupeds, they are prodigioufly lengthened, and beautifully formed into fpiral laminae; in fifties they arc elegantly formed, like the teeth of a comb. Sect. IV. The Ear. The ear in general. The ears are two ; they are fituated in the lateral parts of the head, and are the organs of hearing. Anatomifts commonly divide or diftinguifh the ear into ex- ternal and internal. By the external ear they mean all that lies without the external orifice of the meatus auditorus in the os temporis; by the internal ear, all that lies within the cavities of that bone, and alio the parts that bear any relation thereto. The greateft part of the external ear conflfls of a large car- tilage, very artificially framed, which is the bafis of all the other parts of which this portion of the ear is compofed. The in- ternal ear confifts chiefly of fevcral bony pieces, partly form- ed in the fubftance of the os temporis, and efpecially in that portion of it called apophpfis petrofa; and partly feparated from, but contained in, a particular cavity of that bone. The external ear. Two portions are diftinguifhed in the external ear; one large and folid, called pinna, which is the fuperior, and by much the greater part; the other fmall and loft, called the lobe, which makes the lower part. We may likewife confider two Tides in the outward ear, one turned obliquely

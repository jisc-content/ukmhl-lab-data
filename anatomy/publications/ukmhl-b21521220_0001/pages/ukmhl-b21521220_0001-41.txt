Chap. T. 39 AND ITS APPENDAGES.' which, however, does not feem to be different from that of feveral other eminences of the medulla oblongata. And, for that reafon, we choofe rather to call them, from their figure, iubercula mammillaria, than papillae medulla res. Thefe tubercles feem to have fome immediate relation to the roots or bales of the anterior pillar of the fornix ; fo that we might call them, as M. Santorini has done, the bulbs of thefe roots, though they appear to be likewife part of a conti- nuation of other portions of the cortical and medullary fub- ftance, of a particular texture. The beak or tube of the infundibulum is a very thin pro- duction from the fides of that cavity, and it is ftrengthened by a particular coat given to it by the pia mater. It is bent a little from behind forward, toward the glandula pituitaria, and afterwards expands again round this gland. The membrana arachnoides, or external lamina of the pia mater, appears to be very diftin&ly feparated from the inter- nal lamina, in the interftices between all thefe eminences on the lower fide of the medulla oblongata, without any vifible cellular fubffance between them. The internal lamina ad- heres much more to the furface of thefe interftices than to that of the eminences. The external lamina is as it were buoyed up by the eminences, and equally ftretched between . their moft prominent parts, to which it flicks very clofe j "and in this refpeft the roots or great cornua of the optic nerves may be joined to thefe eminences. We muft obferve in general concerning the eminences of the medulla oblongata, that thofe which are medullary on their outfides or furfaces, are interiorly either entirely corti- cal, or partly cortical and partly medullary, or formed by a fingular mixture of thefe two fubftances, which ftill remains to be unfolded, as well a3 many other peculiarities obfervable in examining the internal ftruefure of the brain.

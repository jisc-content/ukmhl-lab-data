44$ UNIMPREGNATED UTERUS. Part Vh cbme to be loofc, and their direction to be very imperfectly determined. Their cavity is lined by a foft.glandular membrane, which is plaited longitudinally, almoft like the inner 1'urface of the afpera arteria ; and thefe folds arc ftronger and broader near the great extremities than any where elfe. Their fubftance feems to be fpongy, and the interftices between them are moiftened more or lels by a fluid which is continually dif- chargtd there. Blood veffels. The blood veflels of thefe parts are of dif- ferent kinds, viz. the hypogaftric arteries and veins, the ra- mifications of which belong chiefly to the body of the ute- rus j the fpermatic veflels, and the two vafcular ropes, called ligamenta rotunda, which might be more properly termed the vafcular ropes of the uterus or of the ligamenta lata. The hypogaftric branches are arterial and venal ramifica- tions, arifing from the artery and vein of the fafne name ; which having reached the lateral edges of the uterus, are diftributed to all its parts, both internal and external, form- ing a great number of incurvations and particular iutertex- tures. The arteries of one fide communicate both upon the ute- rus, and through its whole fubftance, with thofe of the other fide; and the arterial ramifications of each fide form nume- rous anaftomofes with each other. The veins communicate together on each fide in the fame manner; and all thefe blood-veflels communicate likewife with the fpermatic veflels, with the vafcular ropes of the ligamenta lata, and with the haemorhoidales. Thefe frequent anaftomofes may be demonftrated by in. jetting or blowing into the hypogaftric veflels, having firfl: made proper ligatures to prevent the liquor or air from run- ning into other parts. The extremities of thefe arteries ter- minate and open into the cavity of the uterus, as has been . , ■ • already

Chap. I; 187 AND ITS APPENDAGES. The molares are two glands nearly of the fame kind with the former, each of them being fituaced between the mafTeter and buccinator; and in fome fubjedts they may eafily be mif- taken for two fmall lumps of fat. They fend out fmall duÂ£ls which perforate the buccinator, and open into the cavity of the mouth, almott over againft the laft dentes molares; and from thence Mr Heifter, who firll: delcribed them, called them glandulae molares. All the inlide of the cheeks, near the mouth, is full of fmall glandulous bodies, called glandulae buccales, which open by fmall holes or orifices through the inner membrane of the mouth. The membrane which covers the infide of the lips, which is a continuation of that on the cheeks, is likewife per- forated by a great number of fmall holes, which anfwer to the fame number of Imall glands, called glandulae labiales. The glandulae linguales are thofe of the foramen caecum of the bafis of the tongue, which have been already defcribed. We have alio explained the glandulae palatmae, or thofis that belong to the arch and feptum of the palate; and the glandulae arytenoidaeae were delcribed with the larynx. The uvular glands are only a continuation of the membrane of the palate, in form of a fmall bunch of grapes. We might like- wife reckon among the falival glands thofe of the fuperior portion of the pharynx mentioned in the del'cription of that part, and alfo the follicles of the membrana pituitaria- of the nares, and ot the finufes which communicate with them. The amygdalae are two glandular bodies of a reddii'h co- lour, lying in the interflices between the two lateral half- arches of the feptum palati, one on the right, the other on the left fide of the bafis of the tongue. I heir appearance is not unlike that of the outfide ot an almond-fihcll, both be- caufe their furfate is uneven, and becaufe it is full of holes big enough to admit the head of a large pin. Thefs

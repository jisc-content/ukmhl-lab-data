DIGESTION. 351 fide, which draws back the ligament common to each valve, in fuch a manner as to comprels and exactly clofe the upper fold downward, that nothing may return back into the ileum ; which might eafily happen in a fluid flate of the feces, if this paflage was not fo accurately Ihut up. The feces, when in danger of falling down from the upper parts, dtprefs the upper valve, and thus accurately exclude themlelves. The feces continue to move.flowly forward, becoming more dry, confident, and figured by the fame caufes, through the whole trad! and repeated flexures of the colon. This intefiine is from five to feven feet long, and it is in general capable of retaining the feces for twenty-four hours, fo as to give no in- terruption to the common affairs of life ; this retention, how- ever, is always proportional to the velocity with which the finall inteftines propel their contents. At length the feces fall into the redtum, which being fituat- ed in the midft of much furrounding fat and cellular fub- flance, eafily expands, and fuffers the excrement to be collec- ted in large quantities, and to be retaihcd for a confiderable time. The firudlure of the reclum differs very much from that of the other inteftines, The external membrane or perito- neum is only fpread before it; while behind it is fupported by a broad ftratum of the cellular fubftance, replete with fat and many conglobate glandules, connecting it all the way to the os facrum. The mufcular fibres are much ftronger and more numerous, efpecially the longitudinal ones, than in the other inteftines; being con.pofed of the three liga- ments, expanded and fpread fir ft over the anterior furface, and then over the whole inteftine; they dilate the inteftine before the advancing feces, and draw it back after the feces are excluded. The tranfverfe fibres are alio ftrong ; and the laft of them are oval, forming a protuberant ring, called the internal

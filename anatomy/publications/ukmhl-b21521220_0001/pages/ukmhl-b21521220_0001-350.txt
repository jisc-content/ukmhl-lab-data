348 digestion. Part VI. the villous membrane of the inteftines, within their cavity, is urged and reduced into longer folds ; whence the mucus is exprefled and applied, by the force-of irritation and flimu- lus, to that part of the alimentary mats where it was requir- ed. Thefe long fibres frequently make intro-fufceptions of the inteftines, and generally without any bad conlequences, by drawing up the contracted portion of the intefiine into" that which is loofe, in fuch a manner, that the former is fqr- rounded by the.latter, which is relaxed. , 'â–  The alimentary pulp, diluted, with the pancreatic juice and that of the inteftines, intimately mixed with the faponaceohs bile and circumjacent mucus, is more perfectly difiolved than it was bv the efficacy of the ftomach, in proportion as the tides of the inteftines come into a larger contaCt, and ap- proach nearer together ; to which add, the longer feries of the perifialtic motions, and the greater quantity of diffblving juices. In this manner the alimentary pulp, intermixed with, air, forms a froth, without any kind of fermentation. At the fame time the acid or acefcent quality is corrected, while the oily or fat parts, difiolved by the bile, intermix with the watery juices, and give the ch\le its ufual milky appearance'. It is of a bright colour in the duodenum, at the firfl entrance of the biliary duCt, and may be feen difiinfUy through the whole length of the fmall inteftines adhering to their villous coat. But the gelatinous juices of fh-fh meats, diluted1 with a large portion of water, and likewife from their own fubvif- cid nature, adhere more particularly to the villous coat, and enter it by abforption. Water and watery liquors are all ve- ry fpeedily abforbed, and yet the feculent remains never grow thick in the fmall intefbnes, as far as Haller has been able to obferve, becaufe the watery part is repaired by the arterial vapour and mucus ; nor do they become foetid in any con- fiderable degree, as well becaufe of the great quantity of di- luting juices, as becaufe the quick progreffion will not allow ' them

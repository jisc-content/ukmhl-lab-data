AND ITS APPENDAGES. Chap. I. io 5 Vol. II. O tv foft fat, furrounding rhe globe of the eye, and allowing it a free motion within the orbit. Among the coats of the eye, the iris is the only one pof- feffing motion. Though it has little lenlation, and is not en- dowed with any mechanical irritability ; yet, in a living man, quadruped, or bird, it is contivtied on every greater degree of light, and is dilated on every l'nialler one; hence it is ren- dered broader for viewing dittant objedts, and narrower for Viewing iuch as are near. The caule of this dilatation feems to be a reuiiffion of the powers refitting the aqueous humour; an argument of which is the dilatation of the pupil, occafion- ed by debility, or iucceeding lyncope and death. *The con- tradtion is more obfeure, and perhaps only depends on the ftronger afflux of humours into the colourlcfs converging veffels of the iris; fo that this motion has iomething in com- mon with a beginning inflammation. In an animal twenty or thirty hours dead, Dr Haller has feen the radii of the iris extend by hear, and fliut the pupil. We are as yet unacquainted with the origin of the black pigment; nor can any glandules be found, which fome au- thors have affigned for its reparation. Among its other ui'es, one feems to be, to keeps the cryftalline lens firm. In in- fants, this fame mucus has the image of a radiated flower be- hind the ciliary procefs. The retina, which is a continuation of the medulla from the optic nerve, immediately embraces the vitreous humour. Dr Haller fays, that it extends to the furface of the cryftal- line lens; while Dr Monro oblerves, that it ends fome way behind the ciliary circle. Before we can attain any fatisfa&ory knowledge of the na- ture of vifion, it will be neceffaiy to point out fome of the properties of light. Light is an extremely fubtile fluid, pe- netrating with facility bodies of the clofeft texture, and great- eft denfity in a redtiiineal direction, with the amazing vâ€™eloci-

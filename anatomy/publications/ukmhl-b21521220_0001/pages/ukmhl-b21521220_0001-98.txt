THE EYE, 9^ Part VI. PunEla lacrymalia. Near the great or internal angle of the palpebrae, the flat portions of their edges terminate in another, which is rounder and thinner. By the union of thefe two edges an angle is formed ; which is not perfectly pointed like a true angle, but rounded $ and may be called the internal or tiafal angle. At this place, the extremity of the flat portion is diftin- guiflied from the round portion by a fmall protuberance or papilla, which is obliquely perforated by a fmall hole in the edge of each palpebra. Thefe two fmall holes are very vi- fible, and often more fo in living than in dead bodies ; and they are commonly named punEla lacrymalia, being the orifi- ces of two (mall duffs, called lacrymal. which unite beyond the angle of the eye, and open a little below the upper end of a particular refervoir, termed facculus lacrymalis, which lhall be defcribed with the No/e. The punfta lacrymalia are oppofite to each other, fo that they meet when the eye is fhut. Round the orifice of each of thefe points, we obferve a whitifli circle, which fcems to be a cartilaginous appendix of the tarfus, and which keeps the orifice always open. Thefe two oblique circles are fo difpofecl, that, when the eye is but {lightly fliut, they touch each other only toward the Ikin, and not toward the globe of the eye. The fine membrane which covers thefe circles, and paflcs through the punfla into the duffs, feems fo'me- times to wrinkle when it is touched with a ftilet. This ob- fervation was firft made by M. Saint Yves, a Parifian ocu- lift. Caruncula lacrymalis. The caruncula lacrymalis is a fmall reddifh granulated, oblong body, fituated precifely between the internal angle of the palpebrae and globe of the eye, but it is not flefliy, as its name would infinuate. The fubftance of it feems to be wholly glandular ; and it appears through a fingle microfcopc in the fame manner as the other conglome- rate

374 Part VL LIEN. fplenic vein, which accompanies the artery, is confiderably fotr r than any other vein ot the body: it forms the princi- pal kft branch of the v< r.a poi tae. Betides thele, the lpieen receives ltnaii arteries irom die great coronary delccnding be- hind the pancreas, and fbmetiti.es from tlie internal haemor- rhoidal. l he vafa brtvia of the lpieen and llomach vve have mentioned elffcwhere ; and its ligaments and mem- branes receive I mall- arterial tw.gs from the lumbar arteries, phrenics. intercoftals, and thole ot the renal capfules. The veins in the lpieen, and thole which join it to the itomach, eomn unicate with the phrenics, and with the veins of the renal iaplules. 'I he lymphatic vejfels of the fpleen arife in the duplicature of the fplenic coat or n embrane, and from thence proceed on to the receptacles of the chyle. They are very evident in calves *, but in men they are rendered ccnfpicuous by blow- ing air undir the membrane, by maceration, or water injec- ted into the arteries. The nerves of the fpleen are very fmall j from whence it is capaole of but little pain, and is very rarely inflamed. They arife from a particular plexus, compofed of the pofle- rior branches of the eighth pair at the ftomach, and of cer- tain branches from the large gangliform plexus, which pro- duces the fplenic trunk of the intercotlal nerve, from whence the branches furround the artery into the fpleen. The fabric of the lpieen appears to be much more funpâ€™e than has been commonly believed ; for it is compofed, both in us and calves, altogether of arteries and veins. The arte- ries are fubdivided into few large branches, but into very nu- merous fmall twigs, which are diffi< ult to fill with injec- tions: Thefe twigs terminate in circles, which afford the fluid a ready paflage into the concomitant veins Thefe cir- cles, with their parallel branches, form roundifh brufli-like pencils, that have been miflaken for gfands; but the injec- tion,

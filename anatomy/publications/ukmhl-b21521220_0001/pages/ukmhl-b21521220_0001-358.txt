This broad adhefion is commonly, though improperly, called ligcimentum corona) mm : But, in the firft place, it is not a ligarm nt, as has been already oblerved ; and, fecondly, it is not circular, but oval, ai d very oblong. Ii is not on the upper part of the convex fide of the liver, but along the poftenor part of the great lobe j the broad ex- tremity of the adhefion lying nearer the notch, and the poin- ted extremity towards the right hypochondrium. The middle ligament, called improperly ligamentum hepatis fjpcnjonum, contains, in its duplicature, a thick white rope, like a round ligament, which was the umbilical vein in the foetus' Thus the lower part reprefents a falx $ the convex edge of which is (harp, and the other rounded. All theie ligaments lerve to keep the liver in its proper fi. tuation, and to hinder i; from inclining too much towards â€¢ eith-.r fide: But we mult not imagine that any of them ferve to lufpend it ; becauje it is fufficiently fupported by the fto- niach and inteftines, elpecialjy when they are filled. "When the llomach is empty, or when we faft longer than ordinary, it is a common exprtflion to fay the ftorpach pinch- es us. As the liver is not jthen fuftained by the ftormch and inteftines, it defcends by its own weight, and chiefly by means of the middle ligament, pulls the diaphragm along with it. It is in that place, therefore, that we have this un- eaiy fenfation ; .and not at the luperior orifice of the llomach, as is commonly believed. The right or great lobe of the liver, which lies in the right hypoch rvririum, refts on the right kidney by a fmall luperfi- cial deprefiion above mentioned ; and it likewiie covers a portion of the arch of the colon and the pylorus. About two third parts of the fmall or left lobe lie in the middle of the

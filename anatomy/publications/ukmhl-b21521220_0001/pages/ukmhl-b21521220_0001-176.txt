*74 T&E MOUTH, Part VI* the trachea is likewife fixed to the pofterior part of the bafis of the cricoides. Glottis. The cartilagines arytenoidaeae are connected to the cricoides by ligaments, which furround their articulations with the top of that cartilage. Anteriorly the bafis of each arytenoides is fixed to one end of a ligamentary cord, which, by its other end, is inferted about the middle of the concave fide of the anterior portion of the thyroides. At their infer- tions in the thyroides, thefe two ligaments touch each other; hut a fmall fpace is left between them, where they are fixed in the two arytenoides ; and they feem likewife to have st fmall adhefion to the top of the cricoides. This is what is called the glottis. Under thefe two ligamentary cords there are two others which run likewife from behind forward. The interftice between the fuperior and inferior cords on each fide form a tranfverfe fiffiire, which is the opening of a fmall membra- nous bag, the bottom of which is turned outward, that is, toward the ala of the thyroides. Thefe two facculi are the ventricles mentioned by the antients, and reftored by M. Morgagni, who has given an excellent defcription of them. They are chiefly formed by a continuation of the internal membrane of the larynx, and the inner furface of their bot- tom fometimes appears to be glandular. On the anterior furface of the arytenoid cartilages, there is a fmall depreffion between the bafis and the convex upper part. This depreffion is filled by a glandular body, which not only covers the anterior furface of each arytenoides, but is likewife extended forward from the bafis over the pofte- rior extremity of the neighbouring ligamentary cord. They are larger and more fenfible in fome fubjedts than in others; and they are covered by the membrane which lines the neighbouring parts, Thefe glands were difcovered by M. Morgagni. The

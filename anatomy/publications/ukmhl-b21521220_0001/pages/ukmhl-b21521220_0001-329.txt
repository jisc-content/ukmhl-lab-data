â‚¬hap. III'. MESENTERIUM, Sec.' 321 The mefocolon is the continuation of the mefentery $ which having reached the extremity of the ileum, contracts and changes its name. At this place, the particular lamina which is turned to the right fide, forms a fmall tranfverfe fold, called ligamentum coll dexirum- Afterwards the mefocolon afcends toward the right kid- ney, where it feems to be loft by the immediate adhefion of the colon to that kidney, and to the firft incurvation of the duodenum. Then it appears again, and, increafing in breadth, it continues its courle almoft traniverfely under the liver, ftomach, and fpleen, where it begins to turn downward, un- der the left hypochondrium, toward the kidney on the fame fide. Through this whole courfe the mefocolon extends in breadth, and forms nearly a tranfverfe femicircular plane, ve- ry Utile plaited at its great circumference. By this circum- ference or edge, it is connected to the colon, and hides that ligamentary band of this inteftine, which runs along its fmall curvature. By its fhort or fmall edge, it forms the triangu- lar cafe of the duodenum; and, by its great edge, the ex- ternal coat of the colon, in the fame manner as the mefen- tery does that of the fmall inteftines. As it pafles under the large extremity of the ftomach, it adheres a little to the lower portion of that extremity, as the diaphragm does to the upper. Having got below the left kidney, it contracts, and forms another tranfverfe fold, called llgamcnium coll ftnijlrum. Af- terwards it expands again, but not fo much as in the uppbr part, and runs down on the leftfpfoas mufcle, toward the laft: vertebra of the loins. This defcending portion is fixed to the convolutions of the colon, in the fame manner as the lu- perior portion is to the arch of that inteftine. The inteftinum reCtum is likewife inverted by a particular produ&ion of the peritonaeum, called commonly by the name of

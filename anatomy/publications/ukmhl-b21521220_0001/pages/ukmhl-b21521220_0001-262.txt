LUNGS. Part VI. The varieties in the origins of the bronchial arteries and veins, efpecialiy of the arteries, their communications or a- naftomofes with each other and with the neighbouring vef- fels, and, above all, the immediate anoftomofis of the bron- chial ar-try with the common pulmonary vein, are of fo great confluence in the practice of phyfic, that it will be proper to repeat here what we have faid about them eliewhere, that the attention of the readers may not be diverted by being o- bliged to turn to ar.other part of this work. The bronchial arreries come fomerimes from the anterior part of the aorta defeendens funerior, fometimes from the firft intercoft 1 artery, a d fometimes from one of the oefo- phagaeae. They go out fometimes lepiraâ€™tly, toward each Jung ; fometimes by a Imall common ruuk, which afterwards divides to the right and left, near the bifurcation of the af- pera arteria, hereafter to be delcribed, and follow the ramifi- cations of the bronchia. The left bronchial artery frequently comes from the aorta ; and the right, from the fuperior intercoftal on the fame fide, becaufc of the fituation of the aorta. There is likewife ano- ther which arifes from the aorta pofferiorly near the fuperior intercoftal, and above the anterior bronchiaiis. The bronchial artery gives off a fmall branch to the auricle of the heart on the fame fide, which commun,cates immedi- ately with the coronary artery. Sometin.es one bronchial artery gives origin to fevcral fu- perior intercoftals ; and fometimes feveral bronchial arteries fend off fep^ratcly the fame number of intercoftals. The bronchial veins, as well as arteries, were known to Galen. The vein on the left fide goes into the left fuperior intercoftal vein, while the trunk on the right fide paffes into the vena azygos j and fometimss both veins are branches of the gutturalis.

Intejlinum Ileum. Situation of the ileum. The convolutions of this inteftinc furrouno thole of the jejunum on the two lateral and lower Tides, and it pafies in a winding couri'e from the left fide, by the hypogaltrium, to the right Tide, where it terminates a lit- tle below the right kidney, joining the intefhna crafl'a, in the manner that we Ihall relate hereafter. The lateral convolu- tions are fupported by the offa ilium, fo called, not from this intefline, but from the region of the abdomen t-ermed ilia. StruElUre of the ileum. 1 he ItruClure of the ileum is much the lame with that of the jejunum ; only the internal dupli- catures, or valvulae conniventes, decreafe gradually both in number an,d fize. Near the extremity of the ileum their direction is changed ; and, inftend of being trardvcrle or cir- cular, they become longitudinal, and terminate in a kind of pylorus, which advances into the cavity of the great intef- tines, as we (hall lee prefently. Wt obferve hkewile in this intefline, as in the jejunum, Tingle or lolitary glands or lacunae, and alfo reticular glands, or glands in clutters ; the laft of which, at the extremity of this intefline, are often of a large extent : But the greareft part of thefe glands appear to be flatter here than in the je- junum. The cellular lubftance of the external coat is in lefs quantities than in the foregoing intellines ■, and the ileum appears commonly more pale, or not lo rrtTts the jejunum. Sometimes, though rarely, we meet with procefles fent off from the jejunum or ileum, and of the fame llrudure with thefe inteftincs. Their form, being fimiiar to that of the finger of

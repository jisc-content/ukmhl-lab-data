This fluid being gradually collected after death, makes what is called aqua pericardii, which is found in confiderabie quan- tities in opening dead bodies while they remain frefh. borne, times it is of a reddifh colour, which may be owing to a tranfudation of blood through the fine membrane of the au- ricles. ยง 6. Of the Heart. Situation in general and conformation. The heart is a muf- cular body, fituated in the cavity of the thorax, on the an- terior part of the diaphragm, between the two laminae of the mediaftinum. It is nearly of a conical figure, flatted on the fides, round at the top, and oval at the bafis. Accor- dingly we confider in the heart, the bafis; apex; two edges, the one right and the other left; and two fides, one of which is generally flat and inferior, the other more convex and fu- perior. Befides the mufcular body, which chiefly forms what we call the heart, its bafis is accompanied by two appendices, called auriculae, and by large blood vefiels ; of which hereaf- ter: And all thefe are included in the pericardium. โข The heart is hollow within, and divided by a feptunt which runs between the edges into two cavities, called ven- triculi; one of which is thick and folid ; the other thin and foft. This latter is generally termed the right ventricle, the other the left ventricle; though, in their natural fituation, the right ventricle is placed more anteriorly than the left, as we fhall fee hereafter. Each ventricle opens at the bafis by two orifices; one of which anfwers to the auricles, the other to the mouth of a large artery ; and accordingly one of them may be termed Vot. II. D d the

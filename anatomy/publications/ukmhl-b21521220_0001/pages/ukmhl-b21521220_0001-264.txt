LUNGS. Part VL afa branches are called bronchia ; and that on the right fide is Ihorrer than that of the left, whereas the right pulmonary artery is the lungeft. 'ihe trachea confxits of fegments of circles or cartilaginous hoops, dilpoted in fuch a manner as to form a canal open on the back part, the cartilages not going quite round i but this opening is tilled by a foft glandular membrane, which com- pletes the circumference of the canal; but this cannot be to give way to the oefophagus, for, inftead of delcending im- mediately upon the middle ot that canal, the trachea inclines a little to the right fide, and the fame ltruflure is found in the back part of the great bronchial vcfftls, which are at fome diftance from the oefophagus. Each circle is about the twelfth part of an inch in breadth, and about a quarter of that fpace in thicknefs. Their ex- tremities arc round ; and they are fituated horizontally above each other, fii.all interftices being left between them, and the lower edge of the fuperior fegment being turned towards the upper edge of thofe next below them. They are all connected by a very ftrong elaftic membra- nous ligament fixed to their edges, i have obferved the firft three legments united into one fubftance, bent alternately in two different places, according to its breadth. Sometimes two are continuous in the fame manner. The trachea is covered externally with a quantity of cel- lular fubfiance, which unites it to the neighbouring parts, and it is lined on the infide by a particular membrane, which appears to be partly flefhy or mufcular, and partly li- gamentary, perforated by an infinite number of fmall holts, more or lefs imperceptible, through which a mucilaginous fluid continually pafles, to defend the inner furface of the trachea againft the acrimony of the air which we breathe. This fluid comes from fmall glandular bodies difperfed through the fubfiance of the membrane, but efpecially from , glands

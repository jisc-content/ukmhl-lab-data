M I 312 INTESTINUM DUODENUM. Part Vt i The loofe or floating edge of thefe valves is formed into Email gathers or waves in the natural ftate. 1 he whole fur- face of thefe duplicatures or valves is villous, as well as that of the inteftines between them. The villi of this inteftine are thicker than in the ftomachj but the texture of them in man is not like hairs, as they are commonly reprefented in figures, but rather like that of a fungous granulated fubftance, compofed of an infinite num- ber of very fine papillae of different figures j in which we fee, through a microlcope, a multitude of deprcffed points or pores, by which their whole furface fee ms to be pierced. By the fame help we oblerve, on different places of the inner lurface of this inteftine, ieveral round villous tubercles, fifing like fmall verrucae at different diftances from each other. This fubftance fuftains an infinite number of capillary veffels of different kinds j for, befides the blood-veffels, we jbmetimes obferve a great number of white filaments which run through it, and end at its inner furface like fo many capillary roots of the veffels called venae lafleae. When the villous fubftance is examined in the microfcope, befides the blood-veffels, numerous follicles are obferved lodged in cellular fubftance. Thefe have been confidered as the origin of the ladeal veffels, and have been called ampullulae of Lei- terkuhn, bccaufe he firff difcovered them. The fungous fubftance which bind thefe capillary filaments together, and furrounds them, is very tender; and the capil- lary extremities of the fmall blood-veffels diftributed through it, feem to be turned toward the pores of the papillae. Through thefe pores a mucouc fluid, more or lefs tranfparent, is difcharged, which continually moiftens the cavity of the inteftine. Glands of the duodenum. The internal furface of the duo- denum is furnifhed with a great number of fmall flat glan- dular

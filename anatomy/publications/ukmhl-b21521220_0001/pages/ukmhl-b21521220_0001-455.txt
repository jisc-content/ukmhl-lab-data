Chap. IV. UNIMPREGNATED UTERUS. 453 They Jour mufcles or faf.iculi of flefhy fibres are inferted in the trunk of the clitoris, two on each fide. One of them runs down on the forcfide of the neighbouring corpus caver- nofum, and is inlerted by a tendinous or aponeurotic portion, partly in the extremity of the corpus cavernofum, and partly in the tuberofity of the ifchium. Thefe two mufcles are cal- led ereclores ; but the name of ifch'w-cavernofi would be more proper. s The ether mufcle on each fide lies under the former, and runs down on the fide of the urethra and great orifice of the uterus, all the way to the anus, increafing gradually in breadth in its pafiage, and terminating partly like that which is called accelerator in males. Thefe two mufcles furround very clofely the lateral parts of the urethra and of the great orifice. They expand very much as they defeend, and are fpread on the lower and la- teral parts of the great orifice ; for which reafon feveral ana- tomies have confidered them as mufcular fphindlers. All thefe four mufcles, and efpecially the two latter, are often- times almoft covered with fat. The blood-veflels of the clitoris come chiefly from the hy- pogaftricae, and the nerves from the fecond and third pairs of the nervi facri, by means of which they communicate with the inferior mefenteric plexus, and with the great fym- pathetici. Nymphae. The nymphae, criflae clitoridis, or, as they may likewife be termed, alae minores five internae, are two prominent folds of the inner Jkin of the great or external alae. reaching from the praeputium of the clitoris to the two fides- of the great orifice of the uterus. They begin very narrow, and, having increafed in breadth in their courfe downward, they are again contracted at their lower extre- mity.

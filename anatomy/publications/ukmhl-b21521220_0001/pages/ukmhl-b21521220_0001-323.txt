INTESTINUM COLON. 321 which it is connected ; below this kidney, it turns toward the vertebrae, and terminates there by a double incurvature, or by two oppofite convolutions, which reprefent in fome meafure an inverted Roman g. Thefe lafl: convolutions of the colon are fometimes multi- plied, and even advance to the right fide of the pelvis ; and along the great arch, and the two laft incurvations, there are a kind of fringes, called appendices coli adipofae, which we fhall afterwards explain, as alfo the connections of the colon with the mefocolon and omentum. Valvula coli. At the place where the caecum joins the colon, one portion of the circumference of both is dcprefi'ed, and forms a large fold on the inlide, which advances into the cavity of the inteliine, and gets the name of valve of the ileum, of the caecum, or of the coion. Some have mimed it after Bauhin, who was laid to have difcovered it accidentally in Paris in 1579, by throwing water into the inteftines, and finding that the pafTage was obflruCted at. the end of the ileum ; but Vidus Vidius defcribed it feveral years before this. It is a little open in the middle, and its extremities are very thick, by the mutual duplicature of the coats of the caecum and colon. The extremity of the ileum is as it were grafted in the opening of this fold, and flrongly united to its fides by the adhefion of its tranfverfe fibres to the tranlverfe fibres of the caecum and colon. This union forms a thick ring, which likewife advances into the common cavity of the caecum and colon, where it is wrinkled or formed into gathers, almoft like the lower ex- tremity of the oefophagus, the pylorus, or inlide of the anus. Its circumference is more or lefs ova! ; and, by a kind of continuity with the common fold of the caeeunt and colon, it fo'rms two productions, which M. Morgagni calls the reti- nacula valvulae Bauhini. Vol. II. S s The /

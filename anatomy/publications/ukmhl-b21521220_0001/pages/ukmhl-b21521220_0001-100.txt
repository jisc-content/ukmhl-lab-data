98 THE EYE, Part VI. palpebrae, and which are commonly performed to keep one eye very dole (hut, while we look ftedtaftly with the other, are explicable by the fimpie contraction of ail the portions of the orbicularis. iliele motions likcwifc deprcls the iuperr cilia, which confecpien'ly may be moved in three different manners, upwards by the mufculi frontales, downward by th<^ orbiculares, and forward Dy the fuperciliares. § 9. The VtJJels of the Lye and its Appendages. The external carotid artery, by means of the arteria max- lllaris externa, and the temporal and frontal arteries, give fc- veral ramifications to the integuments which lurround the eye, and to all the portions of the mufculus orbicularis; and thele ramifications.communicate nynh thole which aie ddlri- buted to the metnbrana conjueUva palpebrarum, and to the caruncula. home lmall branches alio corne in through the fpheno-niaxillary luture, to be diltributeu chiefly on the pe- riofleum of the orbit, and to the fat of the eye. The inter- nal carotid artery having entered the cranium, fends off a con- fiaerable branch called the ocular, which accompanies the op- tic nerve, to he diltributed to the mufdes and globe of the eye, to the levator palpebrae, to the fat, glandula lacrymaiis, membrana conjundtiva, caruncula lacrymaiis, &c. It likewife communicates with the external carotid, and fends one or two very fmall branches to the nofe. The branches which fupply the globe of the eye have the name of ciliares; they perforate the back part of the tunica fclerotica in five or fix places, after which they run a little way through its fubflance, where each branch forms a plexus, which fends numerous branches to the choroides. Dr Wrifberg obferves, they next perforate the external lamina of the choroides, and form, between that and the internal lamina, the vafcular ffellae mentioned in the dtferip- 1 .

33^ NERVES. Part VL with the haemorrhoidalis externa, a production of one of tilde arteries- The veins of the redtum go to form the beginning of the meleraica minor or haemcrrhoidalis interna; and they com- municate with the haemorrhoidales externae, vvh ch are rami of one of the hypogaftricae. They communicate like wife with thte capillary ramifications of the other hypogaftric veins, which come from the internal parts of generation of both fexes. It is here to be obferved in general, that there is a fuccef- five continuation, more or Ids fimple or multiplied, between all the arteries of the infdtinal canal, and likewile between all the veins ; and alfo, that the veins are here thinner and more capacious than the arteries, in a greater proportion than in the other parts of the body.

The nerves of the jejunum,, ileum, and mefenteric glands, are the plexus mefentericus fuperior, the poiterior melenteric falciculi, 'and the plexus melentericus inferior. Tne nerves of the caecum are the poiterior mefenteric faf- cicuh or plexus, and the plexus melentericus interior. The nerves of the arch of the colon are the lame falciculi, and the two plexus mdenterici. The nerves of the lalt convolutions of the colon arc the poiterior melenteric fakiculi, and the plexus melentericus inferior and lub-melen ericus. The nerves of the redtum are the plexus mefentericus in- ferior, plexus lub-melentericus or hypogaltricus, and the two ganglions of that plexus. 1 The nerves of the anus, and of its mufcles, are the gan- glions of the plexus fub-mefentericus, the inferior rope of both

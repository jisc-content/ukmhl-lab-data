Part VI; 166 ' THE MOUTH, u folds which cover the inferior half arches of the feptum pa- lati. Thefe three folds are continuations of the membrane which covers the neighbouring parts. The aponeurotic liga- ments of the ftylo-gloffus may be looked upon as true lateral ligaments of the tongue ; and they adhere a little to the lower part of the mufculus pterygoidaeus internus, or ante- rior. The principal blood-veffels of the tongue are thofe that ap- pear fo plainly on its lower furface on each fide of the frae- num ; and they confift of one artery and one vein, which accompany each other, and are called arteriae et venae fublin- guales or raninae. The veins lie next the fraenum, and the arteries on the other fide of the veins. The arteries are rami of the fecond internal or anterior branch of the external ca- rotid on each fide, and communicate with the firfi: external or pofterior branch of the fame carotid, &c. The veins are commonly rami of a branch of the external jugular vein, de- fcribed among the other veins. We ob'erve fix nervous ropes to go very diftin&ly to the bafis of the tongue, and to continue their courfe through its whole fubftance all the way to the point. Two of thefe ropes are rami of the inferior maxillary nerves, or of the third branch of the fifth pair; other two are the nerves of the ninth pair j and the remaining two are fmall portions, or the firft branches of the eighth pair. The great lingual nerve on each fide runs forward between the mulculus mylo-hyoidaeus and hyo-gloffus, under the geni- gloffus, and is diftributed to the flefhy fibres all the way to the point of the tongue, communicating by feveral fmall fila- ments with rhe linguahs minor, and with the nerve from the eighth pair. , For the. other difiributions of it, we refer to the defcription of the nerves. The fmall lingual nerve on each fide goes off from the jnaxillaris inferior, fometitnes at, and fometimes before, its

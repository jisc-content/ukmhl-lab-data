152 THE EAR, Part VI. leffen it. Hence, in fummer time, founds move fwifter; and in Guinea it has been obferved to pafs at the rate of 1170 feet in a fecond. The found, thus every way extended, meets with certain particles in all adjacent bodies, even in water and mercury, to which it communicates fimilar tremors or vibrations; not only to fuch as are in unifon with the original tone, but alfo to others. From hence it is, that every found which we hear is a mixture of the original tone, produced by the trem- bling body, in conjunction with fecondary tones generated from the elaflic tremors of the furrounding bodies. The ftrength of found is increafed, if one audible or primary tone follows the other lo clofely, that their fuccefiion cannot be diftinguifhed by the ear j but, if they follow each other fo {lowly as to be diftinguifhable by the ear, they produce an echo j but, to produce this, requires an interval of fix thirds of time, or the diftance of 55 feet between the echoing body and1 the ear. The fonorous waves of the elaftic air, being driven into the cartilaginous funnel of our ear, are repelled and collected to- gether, by alternate reflections from its elaftic fides, into the cavity of the concha, whence they proceed through the au- ditory paffage j where their force is increafed, (in proportion to the difference between the furface of the outer ear and the area of the paffage), by being contracted into fo narrow a compafs. They are likewife increafed by new founds from the percuffion of the elaftic cartilages and hard bones, which mix imperceptibly with the primitive founds. The bottom or end of the auditory paffage is terminated internally by the membrana tympani; which Dr Haller fays is not naturally perforated, as far as he has been able to difeo- ver; and that the tranfiniffion of tobacco-fmoke from the mouth through the ear is fabulous. Authors in general agree with him now in the former of thefe opinions; but that an accidental

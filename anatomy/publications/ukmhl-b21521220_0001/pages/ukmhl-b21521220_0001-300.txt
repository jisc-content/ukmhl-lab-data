Part VI. PERITONEUM. 2 98 Befides the external productions of the cellular fuftance of the peritonaeum, it has the fame number of internal elonga- tions with the true lamina, which lie between all the dupli- catures, and line the inlides of all the cavities, or that fide next the vilcera contained in them. The veflels and nerves of the peritonaeum are from thofo that fupply the neighbouring parrs. The arteries come from the mammariae internae, the interCortales inferiores, the lum- bares, the «rteriae facrae, the ilio lumbares, the epigaftrieae, the fimall anterior iliacs. the inferior diaphragmatics, and from the veflels which fupply the abdominal vilcera. The veins correfponding with thefe arteries have the fame courfe and bear the fame names. The nerves of this membrane are few in number, and ftnall : They come from the great inter- coftals, from the lumbars and facrals. The ufes of the peritonaeum, in general, feem to be very evident from the delcription which has been given of it : The chief of thefe ufes are, to line the cavity of the abdo- men, to invert the vifeera contained in that cavity as in a common bag, to fupply them with particular coats, and to form productions, ligaments, connections, folds, vaginae, ■as we fhall fee hereafter. The fine fluid which tranfudes through the whole internal furface of the peritonaeum prevents the inconveniencies which might aril'e from the continual frictions and motions to which the vifeera of the abdomen are expofed, either naturally or by external impulfes. We muft here obferve, that it is the common curtom to demonftrate four ligamentary ropes, termed the umbilical vef- fchy before the peritonaeum is opened, becaufe they adhere to the umbilicus; three of them are really veflels in the foe- tus, viz. two umbilical arteries and one vein. We are in a manner obliged to fubmit to this curtom in public anatomical demon ftrations, where we have but one fubjeft for the whole;

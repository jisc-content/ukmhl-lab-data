Part VL fibres; the outermoft of which are mollly longitudinal ; the next to theie are more inclined toward each fide; and the mnermoit more and more oblique; and they become at length almoft tranlverle. All theie fibres imerlect each otjier in various manners; and they are con-ieiftcd together by a fine cel ular fubttunce, and may be lep rated by inflating that fubftance. Rou d the neck of the bladder the mufeuhr fibres are cbâ€™h ly connected, and form what has been called Jphinilet i>e- Jiciie but this part is not a diiiinft rnulcle, nor is its aCtion dilhnct from, the reft of the muicul.tr coat The cellul r coat is nearly of the lame ftrucfture with what is called the tunica nervo/a of the ftomacli. The internal cua is iomething granmated and glandular, fays Winflow ; but later anatomifts deny ilie exiftence of glands here. A mucilaginous ierum is contmu Uy ddcharged through it, which moiftens tne inner luruce of the bladder, and defends it againft the acrimony of the urine. It appears fometimes altogether uneven on the inner tide, bcit.g rud of eminences and irregular rugae when empty, and in its natu- ral ftate of contraction. i hefe inequalities ci:fappear when the bladder is full, or when it is artificially dittended by air, or by injecting any liquid. U/acbus. At the top of the bladder above the fyinphyfis* of the ofia pubis, we oblerve a ligamentary rope, which runs up between the peritonaeum and tire linea alba < f the abdo- men, all the way to the navel, dnninifhing gradually in thick- neis as it afeends. This rope in the foetus is impart a pro- duction of the inner coats of the bladder, which production is termed urachus. Arteriae umbiitcales. This rope is compofed likewife of two other ligainentary elongations, which are the extremities of ( the umbilical arteries. Thefe arteries come from the hypo- gaftricae, run up by the fides of the bladder, and remain hol- ' low

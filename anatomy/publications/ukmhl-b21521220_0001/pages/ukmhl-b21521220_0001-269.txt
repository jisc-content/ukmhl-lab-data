267 Chap. II. respiration. The firft change or mo lificarion which the blood under- goes in the lungs, is to have the cohehon of its parts broken, to be attenuated, and, as it were, reduced to powder. The iecond is, to be deprived of a certain quantity of ferum, which tr.mfpires through the lungs, and is what we com- monly call the breath. The third is, to be in a manner re- animated by the impreffion of the air, whether the whole body of the air enters the blood, whether the common air is only the vehicle of home finer parts which are conveyed to it, or whether the air only comprtrfles and (hakes the blood as it pafles round the bronchial vehicles in the reticular capillary extremities of the veffels. The cartilages of the afpert arteria and bronchia ferve in general to compofe a canal, the fides of which will not fink in or fubfide by compreflion, but will neverrhelefs yield to certain preiTures and impulfes without breaking. As thefe cartilages are not complete circles or rings, and.as their cir- cumferences are completed by elaftic membrane1, they allow of thole dilatations and contractions which modulate the voice ; and as they are connected by elaftic ligaments of a con- fiderable breadth, the alternate elongation and contraction of the bronchia is facilitated in the motions of refpiration. The larynx is commonly looked upon as the upper part of the afpera arteria : But we have already delcribed it in the preceding chapter of the Head, with which it has a particular connection in relation to the tongue. ยง to. Refpiration. The lungs completely fill the facs formed by the pleura. They are freely fulpencled by the great blood vef- fels, unlefs you call that a ligament, which is made by the external membrane of the pleura going to the lungs, and to the balls of the diaphragm. Between the lungs and pleura

THE EYE, Part VL' 75 parts are the mufdes, fat, lachrymal gland, nerves, and blood- veflels. Tie orbits. Seven bones are concerned In the compofition of each orbit, viz. the os frontis, os fphenoidale, os etlvmoi- des, os maxillare, os rmdae, os unguis, and os- palati. In each orbit we are to confider the edge, fides, and bottom. The edge is formed by the os frontis, os maxillare, and os maiae ; the bottom by the os fphenoides and os palati ; and all thefe bones, except the os palati, contribute to form the fides. The bottom is perforated by the foramen opticum of the os fphenoides j and the external fide neap this foramen by two orbitary fi fibres ; one fuperior, called fphenoidalis, the ether inferior, calltd fphevc-maxillaris, already mentioned in the defeription of the ficeleton. All the cavity of the orbit is lined by a membrane, which 5s an elongation or production of the dura mater ; and it comes partly through tjie foramen opticum of the os fphe. xtoides, *»nd partly through the fphenoidal or fuperior orbi- •iary fiflure. This membrane, which may be looked upon as the periofteum of the orbit, communicates with the peri- ofteum of the bafiscranii, by the inferior orbitary fifiure, and with the periofteum of the face at the edge of the orbit. At the upper part of the edge of the orbits, the two perioftea form a kind of broad ligament, and a narrow one at the lower part of this edge, which may be called ligaments of the palpebrae. The particular fituation of the orbits reprefents nearly two funnels, placed laterally at a fmall difiance from each other, 5n fuch a manner as that their apices are alrnofl: joined, their neareft fides being almoft parallel, and the other fides turned obliquely backward; and, for this reafon, the middle of the great circumference, or edge of each orbit, is at a much greater diftance from the feptuin narium than the bottom or apex j and the edge or great circumference is very oblique, the

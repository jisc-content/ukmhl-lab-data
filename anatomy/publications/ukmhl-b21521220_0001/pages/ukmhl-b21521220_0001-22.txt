2o THE BRAIN, Fart VL lateral finufes appears to be a continuation of the longitudi- nal, and the other to be a branch from it. This variety may happen on either fide; and we fometimes find one of thefe finufes higher or lower, larger or fmaller, than the other. The cavity of thefe lateral finufes is likewife triangular, and furnifhed with a proper membrane and with fraena: And it has alfo the fmall venal openings, which indeed are common to it, the longitudinal, and mod other finufes. The pofterior, or outer fide of this cavity, is formed by the external part of the dura mater, and the other two fides by the internal part. As thefe two finufes go out by the pofterior portions of the openings of the balls cranii, called foramina lacera, they are dilated into a kind of bag, proportioned to the foflulae of the venae jugulares, where they terminate in thefe veins. Near the concourfe of the fuperior longitudinal and late- ral finufes, we obferve an opening (fometimes double) which is the orifice of a finus fituated along the union of the falx and tranfverfe feptum. It does not always end direfUy at the lower part of the fuperior finus, but fometimes opens at the beginning of one of the lateral finufes, efpecially when the bifurcation is not equal ; and, in this cafe, it often termi- nates in that lateral finus, which appears like a branch from the common trunk of the fuperior and other lateral finus. This finus has been named torcular Heropholi, from an an- cient author, who imagined that the blood was as it were in a prefs, at the union of thefe four finufes. Its diameter is but fmall, and it forms a kind of bifurcation with the infe- rior longitudinal finus, and with a vein of the cerebrum, which is fometimes double, called vena magna Galeni. The cavernous or lateral finufes of the os fphenoides, are refervatories of a very particular kind, containing not only blood, but confiderable vefiels and nerves, as we fliall fee hereafter; and likewife a fpongy or cavernous fubftanee, full of

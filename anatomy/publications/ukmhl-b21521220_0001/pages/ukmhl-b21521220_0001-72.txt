Part VL THE BRAIN, 7° are hard, they are foftened in the vifcera, mufcles, and fen- foria, before they exert their operations. The nervous fibres, being neither firmly fixed at each end, nor tenfe, can- not therefore tremulate like a tight ftretched cord. Another argument againft their tremulation is, that, through their whole length, the nerves are firmly attached to the folid parts by the cellular fabric. An example of this fadt is feen in thofe very material nerves, the nerves of the heart, which are tied to the great arteries and pericardium. Finally, that the nerves are deftitute of all elafticity, is demonftrated by experiments, in which the nerves cut acrofs neither Ihorten, nor draw back their divided ends to the folid parts; but are rather more elongated by their laxity, and expel their me- dulla in form of a protuberance. Again, the extreme foft- nefs of the medulla in the brain, with all the phenomena of pain and convulfion, leave no room to fufpedt any fort of tendon concerned in the effe&s or operations produced by the nerves. Add to this, that the force of an irritated nerve is never propagated upward, fo as to convulfe the mufcles that are feated above the place of irritation. This is a confequence altogether difagreeing with elafticity; for an elaftic cord pro- pagates its tremors every way, from the point of percuflion to both extremities. But, if neither phenomena or fenfe nor motion can be explained from the nature of elafticity, the only probable fuppofition that remains is, that there is a liquor fent from the brain, which, defending through the nerves, flows out at their extremities ;* the motion of which liquor, quickened by irritation, operates only according to the direction in which it flows through the nerve; fo that convulfions cannot thereby afeend upwards, becaufe of the refiftance made by the frefli afflux of the fluid from the brain. But the fame liquid being put in motion in an organ of fenfe, can carry that fenfation upwards to the brain; fince ‘ V ' ' it

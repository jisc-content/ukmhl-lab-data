Backward, Window obferves, that, on the fide next the periofteum and perichondrium, it is plentifully fiored with finall glands, the excretory dudts of which are very long near the feptum narium, and their orifices are very vifible; and that, by ap- plying a pipe to any of thel'e orifices, the dufls may be blown up almott through their whole extent ; but that, in order to this, the parts mult firft be very well cleaned and wafhed in lukewarm water. Sabatier gives fomewhat of a different de- feription : He admits of mucous follicles ; but fays they are very different-from thofe which are properly called glands. Sinus. The frontal, maxillary, and Iphenoidal finules open into the internal nares, but in different manners. The fron- tal finufes open from above downward, anfwering to the infundibula of the os ethmoides di-fcribed in the hiftory of the fkeleton. The fphenoidales open forwards, oppofite to the poflerior orifices of the nares ; and the maxillares open a little higher, between the two conchae or offa fpongiofa. Therefore the finus frontales dilcharge themlclves moll rea- dily when we hand or fit; and the fphenoidales, when the head is inclined forward. The finus maxillares cannot be emptied wholly, or both, at the fame time, in any one fituation. 1 heir openings, which in fome fubje&s are fingle, in others double, Sec. lie exactly between the two offa fpongiola of the fame fide, about the middle of their depth; fo that, when the head is held flraight, or inclined forward or backward, they can only be half emptied ; but, when we lie on one fide, the finus of the oppofite fide may be wholly emptied ; the other remaining full. It is proper here to obferve the whole extent of the maxil- lary finus. Below, there is but a very thin partition between it and the dentes molares, the roots of which, in lome fub- jeÂ£ls, perforate that feptum. Above, there is only a very thin tranfparent lamina between the orbit and the finus.

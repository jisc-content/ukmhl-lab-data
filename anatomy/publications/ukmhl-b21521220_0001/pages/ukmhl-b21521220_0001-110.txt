ioS THE EYE, Part VI. and fall In betwixt the iris and the fides of the cryftalline lens, are fuffocated or loft in the black paint that lines the iris and the ciliary procdTes ; but thofe rays only fall upon the furface of the lens which enter the cornea at ftnall angles, not much diflant from the perpendicular, or, at moil, not exceeding twenty-eight degrees. By this xneans, all thofe rays are excluded which the refracting power ot the humours of the eye ce'tiid not be able to concentrate or bring together upon the retina ; without which they would paint the objeCt too large and confuledly. rJ he rays falling on the cornea are therefore refraCled, and pafs through the aqueous hun.our in a more parallel, or per- haps converging direction, by which contrivance a greater number of rays fail on the cryitailine than if they had not previoufly palled through the cornea and the aqueous hu- mour. In the cryftalline lens, and moreâ€™elpecially in its pofterior very convex fide, the rays will converge greatly, and pafs thence into the vitreous body. T his vitreous body continues to bend the rays a little mere gently towards the perpendicular, till at length the rays co- ming from the point of difiinCfc vilion, are concentrated into a very (mail part of the retina, where they paint an image of that objeCI from whence they come, but in a pofition inverted, from the necdTary decuflation or crofiing of the rays. The manner in which the images of objeCls are thus painted, may be feen experimentally in an artificial eye, or in a natural eye when the back part of the fclerotica is cut off, and a piece of paper placed to receive the objeCl. The image Is painted on the retina at the end of the vifual axis, which is fituated on the exterior fide of the place where the optic nerve enters the fclerotica ; it is not, however, a mere point, but has fome degree of breadth, fince we fee many pipit ft s at once, whofe images muft be in diftinft points of the

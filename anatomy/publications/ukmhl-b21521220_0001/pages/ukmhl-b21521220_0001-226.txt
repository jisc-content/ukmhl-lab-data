The bafe alfo ad- vances towards the apex; but the apex more evidently to- wards the bafis *. Even the feptuin of the heart is rendered fhorter, and draws itfclf towards the balls. By this aCtion, the flefhy parts of the heart fwell inwardly, and comprefs the blood. Of this fa£t we may be convinced, by thrufting the finger into the ventricle of the heart in an animal new- ly killed. That the heart is accurately enough emptied in this aCtion, appears from the event; from the evident palenels of animals whofe heart is white, as frogs and chickens ; and from the internal furface being full of eminences, which ex- actly anfwer to oppolite cavities, and to the thick reticular arms or columns interrupted by fmufes. The apex of the heart, being contracted a little like a hook, ftrik.es againft that part of the pericardium next the thorax. Forwards, there is alfo a pulfation from the left venal finus, which is at that time filled. In exfpiration, the heart Itrikes violently up- wards and forwards. The truth of both thefe we know by experiment. The blood, which is prefled by the contracted heart, en- deavours to efcape in all directions •, it is driven from the mufcular Tides, towards the axis of the ventricle, and that part of it which is contained between the Tides of the ven- tricle and the annulus of the auricular orifice, puflies the an- nulus within the auricle, and by this aCtion upon the whole circumference of the annulus, it becomes extended. A fmall quantity of blood is indeed returned into the auricle before the # This Dr Haller has often obferved with the greateft cer- tainty in difleCting brute animals; fo that thofe learned gentle- men mult have fome way or other been deceived, who have averted that the heart is elongated during its contraction.

66 THE BRAIN, Part VT. follow either a partial or a total lofs of the power of motion, thofe organs obedient to the will being affedted in confe- quence of a flighter compreffion ; but all the organs, if the preffure be great. The effedts above recited ceafe when the caufe is removed. It may be proper to add, that if the fpi- nal marrow be hurt in the neck, death immediately follows, probably becaufe the nerves of the heart chiefly arife from that part. From thefe confutations, we cannot doubt that the caufe of all motion in the human body arifes from the brain, and its annexed cerebellum and fpinal marrow; and that it thence proceeds through the nerves to all the mufcular parts of the body. Befides, the caufe of this motion cannot refide in the parts themfelves, becaufe otherwifc the moving caufe ivould continue to adt after being feparated from the brain ; â€¢ nor would it be increafed by irritating the brain, or weaken- ed by a comprefilire of it. Is there in the brain any principal part, in which the origin of all motion, and the end of all the fenfations refide, and where the foul has its feat? Is this opinion proved by the fre- quent obfervation, that the fenfes are fometimes entire, and that motion likevvife remains, though the. brain be materially in- jured ? Is the feat of the foul in the corpus callofum ? Is this opinion fliewn by the greater fatality of wounds or dif- eafes in the corpus callofum ! Is this body fufficiently con- nedted with the nerves ? Are there any experiments which prove that from thence the fifth, feventh, and other nerves arife ? Doth not the fame, or even greater mortality of wounds in the medulla fpinalis prove the fame thing ? Yet this is not the feat of the foul, fince though it is comprefled, or even deftroyed, the perfon will furvive a long time with the perfedt ufe of all his mental faculties. Lafily, this opi- nion is oppofed by numerous fadts : Birds have no corpus callofum, and wounds in that body are not more mortal than

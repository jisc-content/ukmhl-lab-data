2o8 Pericardium, part vi by a cellular fubftance, chiefly in that fpace which lies be- tween where the trunks are turned to each other, and the fides of the {heath. There is but a very fmall portion of the inferior vena cava contained in the pericardium. It is the middle lamina which chiefly forms the pericar- dium ; and the figure of this bag is not fimply conical, its apex or point being very round, and the balls having a par- ticular elongation which furrounds the great veflels, as am- ply as the other portion furrounds the heart. The pericardium is clofely connected to the diaphragm, not to the apex, but exactly at that place which anfwers to the flat or lower fide of the heart; and it is a very difficult matter to feparate it from the diaphragm in diflcdlion, the tendinous fibres of the one fubftance intermixing with thofe of the other. This adhering portion is in l'ome meafure of a triangular fhape, anfwering to that of the lower fide of the heart; and the reft of the bag lies upon the diaphragm, with- out any adhefion. The external lamina, or common covering, as it may mor6 properly be called, is formed by the duplicature of the me- diaftinum. It adheres to the proper bag of the pericardium by the intervention of the cellular fubftance in that duplica- ture, but leaves it where the pericardium adheres to the dia- phragm, on the upper furface of which it is fpread, as being a continuation of the pleura. The internal lamina is perforated by an infinite number of very fmall holes, through which a ferous fluid continually tranfudes, in the fame manner as in the peritoneum ; there being no glands for this purpofe, as fome have fuppofed. The pericardium, at its fore part, receives arteries from the mammaria interna, and diaphragmatica: The lower part is fupplied by the diaphragmatica, while the pofterior furface has branches from the fubclavia, from the mammaria, and from the aorta, See. The veins correfporid with the arteries, excepting

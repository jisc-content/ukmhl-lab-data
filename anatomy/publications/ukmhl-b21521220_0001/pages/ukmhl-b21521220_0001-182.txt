'l8o THE MOUTH, Part VI. lages in Tinging birds, but an ample or broad glottis in hoarfe animals, and fitch as bellow or bleat. We obferve the fame fatt in whittling, where the voice becomes manifeftly more acute by a contraction or narrownefs at the mouth : Alfo in mullcal inftruments, in which a narrownefs of the mouth, with a celerity of the wind blown out, are the caufes of an acute or Thrill tone. Gravity of the voice, on the contrary, follows from a de- preflion of the larynx by the caufes already defcribed ; to which add a broad glottis and a very ample larynx. This is evident to the touch of the finger applied to the larynx when a perfon lings, by which the defcent of it is manifeftly per- ceived to be about an inch for every oClave: Hence the voice of males is more grave ; and hence the loweft degrees of the voice degenerate into a mutenefs or whifpering. Is the whole difference of tone owing to the length of the ligaments of the glottis, which is augmented when the fee ti- form cartilage is drawn forward, and the arytenoid ones backward ? Are acute tones produced in proportion as the ligaments are ftretched, and thus vibrating with great celeri- ty ? This has been confirmed by repeated experiments ; and fome late anatomifts have obferved, that, when the cords or ligaments of the glottis are tenfe, the peculiar voice of every kind of animal is produced by blowing air into its larynx : That this voice wTas more acute as the ligaments were more tenfe, and more grave as they were fluckened ; that, by fhut- ting the whole ligament, the voice was fuppreffed •, by fhut- ting the half, the voice was rendered an odlave higher; by fhutting a third part, a fifth higher, See. There are not wanting, however, doubts concerning this new theory, ari- fing from the cartilaginous and bony ftruffure of the glottis of birds, which of confequence mutt be immoveable, and not exter.fible; from the voice raoft certainly becoming more acute, in whittling, from the mere contra&ion of the lips •, from

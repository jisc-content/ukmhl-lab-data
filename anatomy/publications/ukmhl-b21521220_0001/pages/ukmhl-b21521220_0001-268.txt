U/es* Refpiration is performed by organs of two kinds, one of which may be looked upon as aCtive, the other as paf- (iee. 1 he lungs are of the fecond kind, and the firfl com- prehends chiefly the diaphragm and intercoflal mulcles. A loon as the intercoflal mufcles begin to contract, the arches of the ribs are railed together with the flcrnum, and placed at a greater diflance from each other; by which means the cavity of the thorax is enlarged on the two late- ral and anterior lides. At the fame inftant the diaphragm is flatted or brought toward a plane by two motions, which are apparently con- trary; that is, by the contraction of the diaphragm, and the dilatation ot the ribs in which it is inferted. i he external furface of the thorax being thus in a manner increafed, and the cavity of the bronchia being at the lame time, and by the fame means, lels reiilted or prefled upon, the ambient a:r \ields to the external preflure, and lnlinuates itlclf into all the places where the preflure is dinunilhed ; that is, into the alpera arteria, and into-all rhe ramifications of the bron- chia, all the way to the veficles. 1 his is what is called ltfpi- rathn. 1 his morion of infpiration is inflantaneous, and ceaies in a moment, by the re axatio'n of the intercoflal mufcles; the elaflic ligameâ€™ ts and cartilages of the ribs bringing them bark at the fame time to their former firur.rion. I bis mo- tion, by which the ribs are deprcfTcd and brought nearer to each other, is termed cxfpiration. The pulmonary arteries and veins, which accompany the bronchia through all their ramifications, and fun-ound the ve- ficles, trail! to it rhe bi'ood through their narrow capillary ex- tremities, and thereby change or modify it, at leaft in three (different manners.

20* MAMM JE. Part Vh it decreases, and becomes flabby, lofing Its natural confidence and folidity. Body of the mamma. The body of the mamma is partly glandular, and partly confifts of fat j or it is a gland of the conglomerate kind, furrounded on all fides with cellular fub- ftance and fat. The glandular part is divided into little maf- fes, feparated alfo by fat, and again fubdivided into fmall granulae, from which the ladifcrous duds arife: The cellu- lous pelliculae fupport a great many blood-veflels, lymphatics, and ferous or laflifcrous duds, together with the fmall glan- dular moleculae already mentioned; all of them being clofe* ly furrounded by two membranes continued from the pelli- culae. The innermoft of thefe two membranes, which Is in a manner the bafis of the body of the mamma, is thick, and almoft flat, adhering to the mufculus pedoralis major. The fecond, or external membrane, is thinner, forming a parti- cular integument for the body of the mamma, more or lefs convex, and adhering clofely to the Ikin. The corpus adipofum of the mammaf in particular, is a fpongy duller, more or lefs interlarded with fat, or a collec- tion of membranous pelliculae, which, by the particular dif- pofition of their outer fides, form a kind of membrane in fhape of a bag, in which all the reft of the corpus adipofum is contained. The anterior or outer portion of this bag, or that which touches the fkin, is very thin; but that fide next the pedoralis major is thick. Dufius laEliferi. The glandular body contains a white mafs, which is merely a colledion of membranous duds, narrow at their origin, broad in the middle, and which con- trad again as they approach the papilla, near which they were fuppofed by fome to form a circle of communication; but, from the obfervations of the lateft anatomifts, the duds have little or no communication with each other at this place.

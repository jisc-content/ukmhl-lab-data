CHURCHILL 7, GREAT MARLBOROUGH STREET 1902,Y, AONEW, & CO. LP., PRINTERS, LONDON AND ToNBBIDOE. 1W-ZPREFACE TO THE NINTH EDITION. In preparing a Ninth Edition of this work for the press, efforts have been made to curtail its dimensions without impairing its utility, and, with this ol)ject, tlie various references to Surgery and several illustrations present in the last edition have been omitted. The coloured plates from Maclise's "Surgical Anatomy," which were placed at the beginning of the seventh edition, have now been interpolated through the volume in the desci-iptions of the regions to which they refer. The text has been carefully revised, a few additions and alterations having been effected, and the original object of the author has been carefully borne in mind, viz., to provide the student with an accurate and not too elaborate guide for use in the dissecting room, and for purposes of subsequent reference.

By Practical Anatomy is meant the study of Anutomy by dissection of the dead body, in conti-adistinction to Descriptive Anatomy, taught by lectures, diagi-ams, and preparations. In dissecting, there are four principal objects to be constantly borne in mind by the student :^lst. The impression on the memory of the facts of general anatomy taught in the lectures. 2nd. The study of those parts of the body more especially concerned in surgical affections and operations. 3rd. The education of the sense of touch, and of the hand m the use of instruments; and 4th, the education oi the eyem the knowledge of the several structures of the body, in vanous positions, and under vai7ing circumstances. It is to assist the student m these requirements that the following work i^ designed; and every effort has been made to present the-facts of Anatomy m such a manner that they may be most easily grasped by the mind and retained by the memoiy. The education of the eye IS a gradual and tedious process, but one which is certain to be satisfactorily accompHshed if the student do but use his hands properly, and therefore a few words on the manual part of dissection may not be out of place. First, as to the INSTRUMENTS requisite for dissection. A case containing SIX scalpels, two pairs of scissors, a pair of dissecting forceps, a set of chau>-hooks, a blow-pipe and a probe, will enable the student to make all requisite dissections, supposing that he is allowed the use of a saw and chisel in the dissecting-roon,. bLALPELS for dissection are made of two i)rincipal shapes • in nfl, ^f^"^^'*^ *" ^^'"^ ^^"^ b'^ck being straight- m the other both back and edge are bevelled to a point midway between the two. The latter fonn is preferable for n^ost purples'; 112 INTRODUCTION. The blade should not be more than an inch and a half long, and never double-edged, but the material of which the handle is constructed is a matter of indifference. For all ordrnary dissection it will be found most convenient to hold the scalpel like a ]5en ; but for cleaning the fascia olf muscles, and foUowing out small nerves, it is better to hold it reversed, so that the back of the kn>fe may be against the tissue which is to be preserved. In making the incision through the skin of a limb, or m any other pos tion where a long incision is required, the knife may, with advantage be held und°er the hand, by which the m.st has more play and the student has the opportunity of practising a mode of holding the knife which he will find very useful when operatmg on a b^ang ^^The FOECEPS should be broad at the exti-emities and coarsely senXd so that it may retain a firm hold on smaU portions of Ssue It is very important that the forceps should not be too in the sprino- for in that case its use becomes so fatiguing to he h^d that iUs%ossible to continue it for any length of time It is a^so important to ascertain that the points do not separate when he uLs are pressed forcibly together.

The under surface of skin neatly reflected is white, and the tissue beneath it more or less yellow. The SUPEEFICIAL FASCIA consists of loose areolar tissue containing more or less fat. It contains the superficial blood- vessels, nerves, and lymphatics, and may in some situations be divided into two layers. The DEEP FASCIA is a more or less dense fibrous structm-e, usually white and glistening in aj)pearance, lying beneath the superficial fascia, closely investing the musculature of the liinbs, and sending inwards deep intei-muscular processes or septa, some of which are strongly attached to the bones. It forms sheaths for the muscles, and gives attachment to muscular fibres. In some parts it may be subdivided into superficial and deeper laminae, as in the neck and thigh. In cleaning MUSCLES, it is essential that the fibres shoirld be made tense by moving the limb or applying the hooks. A muscle should invariably be cleaned along its fibres, the dissector beginning at one edge and advancing steadily to the other, and thus reflecting a complete layer of fascia; the knife being held with the back to the muscle, to avoid injury to it. The attachments of a muscle (origin and insertion) should always be most carefully followed out, and studied on the separate bones; but it is important also to clean the fascia fi-om the whole length of the muscle, or it will soon look dirty. A muscle should be divided, when necessary, midway between its origin and insertion, so that these important points may be preserved for further reference. The action of the various muscles may be roughly but very usefully investigated in the course of dissection. As a rule, the eifect of the contraction of a nuiscle, upon any' articulation over which it passes, may be estimated by ascertaining what movements at that joint apiiroximate the origin and insertion of the muscle; but where the connection of a muscle witli a puUoy or sesamoid bone leads to an alteration in the course of its long axis, the calculation must be made from the point at which tlie line of action is so changed. Where a muscle passes over more than one joint, its effects upon each articulation must be tested separately, and it 15 2INTRODUCTION. 4 should be seen in what way those effects are modified by changes of position in the other joints concerned. The muscles may act: (1) as joint motors causing various altera- tions in the position of the bones (flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, rotation inwards and outwards, &c.); (2) as dilators or constrictors of the various apertures of the body—mouth, anus, palpebral fissui-e, &c.; (3) as cUlators or constrictors of the thoracic and abdomino-pelvic cavities; (4) as, motors of soft parts—skin, mucous and synovial membranes, &c.; (5) as tensors of deep fascite, as in the thigh; thus probably aiding the circulation m the muscles. The influence of gravitation upon muscular action is very considerable. In certain cases movements of flexion involve a predominant exertion of the extensor muscles, and vice versa. Thus in bending forward the body at the hips while in the standing position, the movement having been initiated by the flexors the extensors come into play to restrain and regulate it: <.e., to lower the trunk to the degree and at the rate required. The AETEEIES of a subject are usually mjected, and it is impossible to follow out all the minute branches without tlds assist- ance ; but an opportunity should be taken by the advanced student to repeat his dissection upon an uninjected subject, m which the appearance of the parts more closely resembles that of the hvmg ^°The VEINS may be divided into superficial and deep, the foi-mer runnin- in the superficial fascia, the latter accompanying the arteries^ The two sets of vessels are united by commmncatmg branches.

In order to preserve a part, it is desirable that the dissector should himself secure the skin around it with a few stitches, and wrap it with damp or oiled cloths. These may be dipped in some preserva- tive solution, or common salt may be grated finely over the part. This latter, however, destroys the coloru- and smooth appearance of the structm-es. A dissected part should be sponged over daily, when it is uncovered for fresh dissection.t- DENT PAET I. DISSECTION OF THE ARM. [The Student is requested to read the " lutrodudion" before commend, the Dissection, unless he has done so on a previous ovcasum.^ Before beginnmg the dissection, the student ^^^o^^l^ ^^^^ fully acquainted with the external configuration of the part and the relations of surface-markings to deeper structures The curves of the duviele are generally seen mth ease; hut the finger shordd be carried along the bone to note any m-egiUanty denoting old fi'acture, and to trace its articulation with the acromion p^cess'of the scapula, where the outer end of the bone usually overrides the acromion and may form a marked Prominence The acr<.nio-duriadar joint fissure runs in a ^--^f-'^^"^'^^^:^^^^^^ vertically above the middle of the upper extreimty of the hmnej. when the hand is supinated.

In a muscular subject, a long,'triangular_groove or dimple, the n)/m, ckiricular fossa, at this point marks the separation between^thq upper parts of the deltoid and the pectoraUs major; and a linear furrow, extending obHquely fi'om near the inner end of the clavicle, occasionally marks the division between the sternal and claviciilar fibres of the latter muscle. By lifting the arm and drawing it from the body, the anterior and posterior boundaries of the axilla will be made prominent, and the fascia extending from one to the other will be put on the stretch so that the finger cannot be pushed into the armpit; whereas if the arm is brought to the side the fascia is relaxed, and the finger will readily feel the head and neck of the humeru.s, with the great vessels and nerves to theii- inner side, and internal to these again the wall of the thorax, with probably some Ijnnphatic glands. The biceps muscle forais a prominence on the front of the ARM, and the brachial artery and media,n verve can be traced along its inner border to the bend of the elbow, and the shaft of the humerus can be readily felt. The position of the coraco-braclualls may be seen on the inner side of the aim in a muscular subject, and on the outer side a sulcus corresponding to the insertion of the deltoid, and below this the convexity of the subcutaneous portion of the brachialis anticus, between the biceps and triceps. The 2)ronator radii teres is seen crossing the lower part of the brachialis anticus to reach the outer side of the front of the fore-arm. In front of the elbow is a hollow, corresponding to a space between the supinator longus and pronator teres, known as the ante-cubital fossa, over which the superficial veins may be seen beneath the integument. The prominent internal condyle of the humerus and its relation to the olecranon process of the ulna should be observed, and the vlnar nerve can be felt between the two points of bone. The rounded external condyle, with the ridge leading to it, is distinct in most subjects, and immediately below it, the head, of the radius, which should bo rotated, in order that its relation to the condyle may be better appreciated. The rounded posterior surface of the arm is fonned by the triceps muscle. In the FOUE-AKM the radius can be but little felt, except at its lower extremity; hnt the olecranon process and sharp posteaior margin of the ulna are always to bo recognised, even in very muscular subjects. The tendon of the biceps may bo felt jjassing to its iTisortion. It should bo observed that the ulna is the more8 DISSECTION OF THE ARM. prominent of the two bones at the wist, whilst the end of the radius extends a little lower down than that of the nlna ; and the stjdoid process of each can be readily distinguished. The tendons of the flexor carpi radialis and flexor carpi ulnaris are usually pro- minent, and serve as guides to the radial and ulnar arterirs, which may be felt (it injected) to the outer, or radial, side of each tendon. In front, below the radio-carpal joint, may be felt the projection of the pisiform bane on the ulnar side, and, less distinctly, that of the tubercle of the scaphoid on the radial side. Behind and on the outer side may be traced the extensor tendons of the wrist, fingers, and thumb. In the HAND the metacarpus and the phalanges are to be examined, and it should be borne in mind that the transverse markings, on either the palmar or dorsal aspect of the fingers, form no guide to the articulations. In the case of the metacarpo-phalangeal joints, the line of articulation is about three-quarters of an inch on the proximal side of the web. When the finger is bent, the prominence at the articulation is due to the proximal bone, and the joint is distal to that point. The limb should be carefully bandaged fi-om the fingers to the middle of the upper arm, and only uncovered as far as may be necessary in the progress of the dissection. [The arm being drawn away from the side, an incision is to be made half an inch to one side of the mechan line of the sternum in its whole length, and is to be joined at right angles by another running along the whole length of the clavicle to the acromion process, thence in a vertical direction half-way down the upper arm, and then across the inner aspect of the arm as far as the level of the posterior fold of the axilla. Another incision is to be made transversely from the ensiform cartilage, and must be carried beyond the posterior fold of the armpit. The large flap of skin thus marked out is to be reflected towards the arm, the dissector on the right side beginning at the lower end of the sternum, and on the left side at its upper extremity.] Beneath the skin is the subcutaneous fascia, which is often very fatty. The inamma will also be exposed in the female, or its rudiment in the male subject, and an incision may be carried around the nipple so as to leave it attached to the gland in the former. In a well-developed body the fibres of the platysma myoides may be seen arising from the fascia below the clavicle. , , n • -ui In the female the Mamma, or breast, is a gland of very vanable bulk lying upon tlio groat p.H'toral muscle, from which it is separated by a quantity of loose cellular tissue. Its base is9 THE MAMMA. triciispicL and usually extends from the side of the sternum to the margm of the anterior wall of the axilla, reaching from the third to the sixth rib in the vertical drrection. Two of the cusps or out- Ipng processes run towards the axiUa (one above, the other below), and "the third extends towards the edge of the sternum, often reaching or overlapping it. From its pectoral surface minute lobules may penetrate the deep fascia, and even become embedded in the fibres of the muscle. Immediately below the centre of its anterior surface, and usually between the fourth and fifth ribs, is the mamilki or nipple, around which is the areola of discoloured skin, the tint of which becomes darker in pregnancy. The nipple is pierced by numerous small lactiferous ducts. Its skin is thin and delicate, and contains a quantity of unstriped muscle which is prolonged into the areola. The skin of the areola presents a number of little prominences due to the presence of miniature sebaceous glands (glands of Montgomery) in the subcutaneous areolar tissue. The gland consists of about twenty distinct lobes ensheathed by the segments of a tough capsule of cellular tissue. Each lobe is abundantly supplied with blood-vessels, and has a separate lar.tiferons dud, which converges towards the nipple, and beneath the areola becomes dilated into a lacteal sinus or ampulla. The arteries of the breast are derived from the thoracic and external mammary branches of the axillary artery, from the in- tercostal arteries, and from the internal mammary branch of the subclavian, which runs behind the costal cartilages about half an inch fi-om the border of the sternum. Cutaneous Nerves and Vessels.—In the superficial fascia on the front of the chest are the anterior cutaneous branches of the intercostal nerves and of the internal mammary artery. They appear at regular intervals in the intercostal spaces on each side of the sternum as they pierce the pectoral muscle, and are of small size. The terminations of the descending branches of the superficial cerncdl plexus mny also he found beneath, or piercing, the platysma, and crossing the clavicle in the positions iniplied by thciir nanics, viz., sternal, clavicular, and acromial. Some twigs reach as low as the foui'th rib. These cutaneous vessels and nerves being turned aside, the deeji or pectoral fascia is exposed ; this is attached superiorly to the clavicle, internally to the front of the sternum, inferiorlj' is continuous with the fascia c(ivoring the abdominal muscles, exter- nally joins the fascia of the deltoid, and at the lower border of theDISSECTION OF THE ARM. 10 pectoralis major assists in the formation of the axillary fascia. On removing this fascia the pectoralis major is exposed. [The pectoralis major is to be put on the stretch by drawing the arm from the side and supporting it at a convenient height, its fibres are then to be cleaned from below on the right, and fi-om above on the left side. The strong axillary fascia is to be left untouched.] The Pectoralis Major (Fig. 1, 2) consists of a sternal and a clavicular portion, separated at their origins by a cellular interval. The sternal portion arises from nearly the whole length of one side of the manubrium and body of the sternum, the cartilages of all the true ribs except the seventh, and is connected below with the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle. The clavicular portion arises from the anterior surface of the inner or sternal half of the clavicle, and from the anterior siu'face of the capsule of the sterno- clavicular articulation; and is separated from the deltoid muscle by another celMar interval, containing the cephaHc vein and the humeral branch of the aoromio-thoracic artery. The muscle is uisprted into the anterior or outer edge of the bicipital groove of the humerus, by three superposed laminse, the superficial layer con- sisting of the clavicular fibres, the middle layer of the upper sternal fibres, and the deep layer of the lower sternal fibres and those fi-om the aponeurosis of the external oblique. The latter is continuous below with the middle layer, and its fibres cross each other m such a manner that those which are lowest at the origin are highest at the point of insertion, and vice vcrsci. It is more tendinous than the superficial layer, and sends a prolongation over the long head of the biceps to the capsule of the shoulder-joint; from the lower border of the tendon a slip is given off to the deep fascia of the The action of the pectoraHs major is to flex, adduct, and rotate inwards the humerus, crossing it over the chest, and by its sternnl fibres to draw forwards and inwards the whole scapular arch, it the arm were raised above the chest the muscle would depress it, «r it the han<l were fixed it would drag the trunk upwards, as m climb- iT,o.. Its lower fibres may also act in extraordiuary inspiration when the arm is fixed, as is seen in the case of asthmatic persons. It is snprdied by the external and internal anterior thoracic nerves. In very well-developed subjects, muscular slips are not "*equently found lying at the side of the sternum and superficial to the pectorall with which they may have some connection; but they are niore frequently continuous with the sterno-mastoid or rectus11 THE AXILLA. abdominis. A slip, of some surgical interest, is often found near the axillary border of the muscle, connecting it witb the biceps or the latissimus dorsi. The Axilla. [If the arm is well drawn from the side the boundaries of the axilla or armpit will be readily seen, and if the skin has not been already removed from the posterior boimdary (latissimus dorsi), it should now be turned back. The strong deep fascia will be seen stretching from the pectoralis to the latissimus dorsi, forming the base of the conical space known as the axilla; and the student should again notice that it is impossible to thrust the finger deeply into the space so long as the fascia is stretched by the extension of the arm, but that when the arm is di-awn to the side the finger enters readily, and can feel the axillary artery (if injected), and the head of the humerus. The lateral cutaneous branches of the intercostal vessels and nerves are to be found behind the border of the pectoralis major, by carefully dividing the fascia parallel to the ribs.] Lateral Cutaneous Nerves and Vessels.—The first inter- costal nei-ve has no lateral branch, but six lateral branches from the upper nerves (from 2nd to 7th) will be found appearing at the side of the chest, between the digitations of the serratus magnus, and are accompanied by corresponding arterial twigs. Each lateral cuta- neous nerve, except that of the second, divides into anterior and posterior branches, which turn forwards to the pectoral region and backwards over the latissimus dorsi respectively. The lateral cutaneous branch of the second nerve passes down the inner side of the arm to join the lesser internal cutaneous nerve, or nerve of Wrisberg, and is hence called the iidercosto- hiimerrd nerve. The corresponding branch from the third nerve usually accompanies and joins this. These last must be found at once and are to be carefully preserved (Fig. 1, 24). [All the fat is to bo removed from tlie axilla, and the muscles cleaned so far as they are exposed. Care must also be taken not to injure the following structures whilst cleaning them:—the axillary vessels (particularly the vein) and the largo nerves, which are to the outer side of the spaxje ; the posterior thoracic nerve, which runs v(!rti(;ally upcjn th(i serratus magnus ncsar the posterior wall of thi' axilla, giving off a branch to each digitation of the muscle; the subscapular vessels at the outer border of the subsc-apularis; the long thoi'acic artery near the lower border of the pectoralis minor; and the three subscapular nerves which cross the space, passing froTn above downwards and outwards. Ouv. or two of the numerous lymphatic glands should also be preserved.]THK AXILLA. 12 The Axilla (Figs. 1 and 2) is a conical sjiace between the chest and upper arm, and has the following boundaries:—In front, the pectoralis major, the pectoralis minor, the clavicle, subclavius, and clavi-pectoral fascia ; he.li.ind, the subscapularis, latissimus dorsi, and teres major muscles, with the body of the scapula; to the inner side, the serratus magnus, with the four- upper ribs and intercostal spaces; and to the outer side, the coracoid process, the upper part of the humerus and the coraco-brachiaUs and biceps muscles.

The axillary vessels and brachial plexus of nerves, entering at the apex, lie along the outer boundary of the space, the artery being first on the inner side of the nerve cords, then between them, and the vein keeping to the inner side of the artery, whilst most of the branches of the artery take a general dii-ection towards the thorax. Towards the inner side of the space, and imbedded in fat, are the glands, ten or twelve in number, which receive the lymphatics from (1) the fi'ont of the chest and the mamma, (2) the abdomen as low as the umbilicus, (3) from the arm, and (4) from part of the back. The superficial glands lie along the edge of the pectoralis, and the deeper ones mostly in close proximity to the axillary vein, but others are found at the back of the axilla along the subscapular vessels. They are connected above with the deep cervical glands. Oppoi-tunitj-is to be taken, before any further dissection is made, to expose the lower part of the axillary artery thoroughly, as that is the portion of the vessel to which a ligature is most easily applied. It should be noted that a portion of the subclavian artery is exposed in the dissection of the axilla. [The clavicular portion of the pectoralis major is to be divided vertically about its middle and reflected, without injmmg the cephalic vein, when branches of the acromio-thoracic artery and the external anterior thoracic nerve will be seen entering its under sm-face. After clearing away some loose cellular tissue, the coracoid process and the insei-tion of the pectoralis minor will be exposed, with the costo-coracoid membrane above the latter.] The Costo-coracoid Membrane or Clavi-Pectoral fascia is a strong fascia consisting of two layers, which embrace the subclavius muscle. It is attached above to the two lips of the subclavian Fig. 2.—The axilla (from MacliHo's Surgical Anatomy). A. Axillary vein. B. Axillary artery. 1). Subscapular artery. C Coraco-bracliialis. D.

The two layers unite below, forming a process which extends to the upper border of the pectoralis minor, where it splits into two to encase that muscle; this portion of the clavi-pectoral fascia is pierced by the cephalic vein, the acromio-thoracic vessels, and the external anterior thoracic nerve, and assists in forming the sheath of the axillary vessels. The Subclavius (Fig. 3, 5) is a small muscle which (irises by a tendon from the first rib at the junction of bone and cartilage, and is inserted into the groove on the under surface of the middle thii-d of the clavicle. It is a depressor of the clavicle aud shoulder gii-dle, and is supjjlied by a special branch of the brachial plexus above the clavicle, derived from the trunk formed by the junction of the fifth and sixth cervical nerves. The sheath of the axillary vessels is derived from the deep cervical fascia, and is strengthened by a process of the costo-coracoid membrane. It may be traced into the arm, fore-arm, and hand. [The costo-coracoid membrane and sheath of the vessels are to be carefully removed without injmy to the superior and acromio- thoracic arteries, and the axillary artery and yem and brachial nerves in their upper part are to be cleaned. This dissection will admit light into the upper part of the axilla, and allow its bouncl- aries and contents to be better studied. The remainder of the pectoraHs major is then to be divided and reflected, to expose the pectoralis minor with the long thoracic artery at its lower border.] The Pectoralis Minor (Fig. 3, 11) lies beneath the pectoralis major, and is invested on both surfaces by a fascia which is attached above to the costo-coracoid membrane, and below to the axUlary fascia, cHviding the axillary space into two compai-tments. It arises from the anterior extremities of the bony portions of the third foui'th, and fifth ribs, sometimes also from the second, and from'the intercostal fascia; and is inserted into the inner side and upper surface of the coracoid process of the scapula, aud commonly also into an inter-muscular septum between it and the coraco- brachialis. It crosses the axiUary vessels and nerves obbquely. and is said to divifle the artery into three stages. Action.-Thi^ muscle draws the coracoid process downwards, forwards, and inwards, and with it the whole scapular arch, increasing the range of motion of the upper extremity in these directions. It is also an extraordinary muscle of inspiration if the coracoid process be fixed.15 THE AXILLARY ARTERY. It is supplied by the internal anterior thoracic nerve, which perforates it to reach the pectoralis major. [The pectoralis minor is to be divided two inches from its inser- tion when the axillary vessels and nerves will be fully exposed and must be cleaned. The small nerve emerging from between the artery and vein, and entering the pectoralis mmor, is the internal anterior thoracic] Pisr. 3.

In its upper part it is placed deeply in the axilla, but its lower portion is comparatively superficial. The artery is divided into three parts, the first, ahovt ; the second, behind; and the third, helow the pectoraHs minor; but it should be remembered that the position of the muscle shifts to some extent with the movements of the scapular arch, and that its development varies considerably in different subjects. When the pectoralis minor arises fi'om the second rib, it may completely cover the upper portion of the artery. The first part, of small extent, runs fi-om the outer border of the first rib to the upper border of pectoralis minor. It has /// front the pectoralis major muscle, the costo-coracoid membrane and the acromio-thoracic artery, and is crossed by the cephalic vein and by the external anterior thoracic nerve; behind, it has the fii-st inter- costal space and second rib, with the first and second digitations of the serratvis magnus and the posterior thoracic nerve ; to its inner side are the axiUary vein, lymphatics, and the internal anterior thoracic nerve, and to the outer are the large cords of the brachial plexus. This part of the artery generally gives off two branches, the Superior Thoracic and Acromio-Thoracic. The svcond part (behind the pectoralis minor) has in front the pectoralis major and the pectoralis minor; behind is a cellular space with the inner and posterior cords of the brachial plexus; to its inner side are the vein and the lower part of the imier cord; and on the Older side are the coracoid process, the coraco-brachialis, and the outer cord of the plexus. The branches of this part of the artery are the Long Thoracic and the Alar Thoracic. The third part (from the lower border of the pectoralis minor to the lower border of the teres major) has in front the pectoraUs major, the inner head of the mecHan nerve, the large mternal cutaneous nerve, and the outer brachial vena comes crossing at a variable point to join the inner: below the lower border of the pectoralis major the artery is subcutaneous; behind, it hes upon the lower part of the subscapularis, the tendon ot the latissimus dorsi, and a small portion of the teres major muscle, with the musculo-spiral and the circumflex nerves; to its inner side the axillary vein (formed by the junction of the ba-sihc vein ^^ath the ven^e comites of the brachial artery), the inner head of the median nerve (for a short distance), the ulnar, and the lesser mternal cutlneous (Wrisberg) nerves; to the onter side i. the «n-aco- WMs muscle, with the outer head of the median at first, bul lower down the entire nerve, and also the extei-nal cutaneous nervt17 THE AXILLARY ARTERY. until it pierces the coraco-brachialis. The branches of this portion are the Subscapular, Anterior Cii-cumflex, and Posterior Circum- flex, all of which usually arise near the lower border of the subscapularis. Branches of the Axillary Artery (Fig. 4). 1. The sujH'rior thoracic (3) is a small branch supplying the side of the chest about the iirst and second ribs, and anastomosing with the internal mammary and intercostal arteries. 2. The acromio-thoracic {thoracica-humerana; thoracic axis) (i) is a large branch which arises from the artery immediately above the pectoraHs minor, and after reaching the upper border of the muscle, pierces the costo-coracoid membrane and divides into four' branches. One [thoracic) runs forward to supply the sen-atus magnus, intercostals, and pectoralis muscles; a second [acromial) passes outwards to the acromion process and shoulder, anastomosing with the posterior circumflex and suprascapular ; a third [humeral] downwards in the groove between the pectoralis major and deltoid by the side of the cephalic vein ; and a fourth [cJaviciilar) upwards to the clavicle and subclavius. 3. The long thoracic (5) runs along the lower border of the pecto- ralis minor to the side of the chest, where it suppHes the mamma, and is hence sometimes called the external mammary artery. It anastomoses with the internal mammary, intercostal, acromio- thoracic, and subscapular arteries. A separate external mammary artery often exists in females, parallel with but external to the long thoracic, and assists in supplying the breast. 4. The alar thoracic (3) are twigs of siipply to the axillary glands, seldom arising directly from the axillaiy, but generally from its branches. 5. The sithscapular (15) is a large branch which runs along the lower border of the subscapularis muscle to the side of the chest with the long subscapular nerve, to sujiply the serratus magnus, the intercostal spaces, and the scapiila and its muscles; anasto- mosing with the intercostals, long thoracic and scajjular arteries. An inch or less from its origin this artery gives oS a large branch, the doraalis scupulcv (17), which winds round the lower border of the subscajndaris muscle, grooving the axillary border of the scapula, and, after giving a ventral branch called the infra-scapular, dis- appears through a triangular interval, bounded (as seen from the front) by the long head of the triceps, the teres major, and the subscapularis. The terminal branch of the subscapular runs to the angle of the bone and anastomoses with the termination of the posterior scapular artery.18 THE AXILLA. 6 The anterior circumflex is a small branch winding around the neck of the humerus beneath the coraco-hrachialis and biceps, which it supplies, giving also an ascending branch up the bicipital groove to the shoulder-joint. 7 The posterior circumflex (12) is larger than the anterior, and winds behind the neck of the humerus with the circumflex nerve to supply the deltoid, passing thi-ough a quadrilateral space bounded Pi„ 4 —The axillary artery and its br ^' removed (drawn by 1 Acromio-thoracic artery. 2.

It also supplies branches to the shoulder-joint, the greater tuberosity of the humerus and the acromion. It anastomoses with the anterior circumflex, the supra-scaprdar, the sui^erior profunda, and acromio-thoracic. The Axillary Vein'(Pig. 3, i8) lies to the inner side of the artery. It is formed by the junction of the basilic vein with the vena; comites of the brachial artery, usually near the upper border of the teres major, and, having received tribiitaries corresponding to the branches of the axillary arter_y, and the cephalic vein immediately below the clavicle, it reaches the outer border of the first rib and becomes the subclavian. It is intimately related to the axillary lymphatics. Brachial Nerves (Fig. 5).—The large cords of the brachial plexus are derived from the anterior branches of the 5th, 6th, 7th, Sth cervical and the greater jjart of the 1st thoracic nerves, which make theu- apjaearance in the posterior triangle of the neck, receiv- ing usually a commimicating branch siiperiorily from the 4th cervical, and occasionally one below from the 2nd thoracic nerve (Part IV.). The nerves coalesce and divide again in a variable manner (see Posterior Triangle of the Neck), but the resiilt is that they enter the axilla as three cords, lying to the outer side of the first part of the axillary artery. The posterior and internal cords then pass behind the second stage of the vessel, the latter con- tinuing its course to reach the inner side, while the outer cord remains external; and the several branches derived from these trunks, and now to be examined, more or less sm-roimd the artery in its third part. The plexus consists occasionally of only two cords, when it enters the axilla; in which case a third cord is formed below the clavicle by the luiion of branches derived from these two cords. / Outer cord . . . „ , , . . ,, From 4lh, 5th, (Externa anterior thoracic. 6th, and 7th cer-l Ex ernal cutaneous, vical nerves. °^ median.

The Ea-ieriiitl aiderior thoracic verve (Eig. 6, ii) is a small branch derived fi-om the outer cord, going to the imder surface of the clavicular and upper sternal portion of the pectorahs major, which it supplies. It pierces the costo-coracoid membrane, and crosses the first stage of the axillary artery. The Internal anterior thoracic nerve (Pig.

Three Suhscapular nerves (Fig. 6, 27, 28, 29) are derived from the posterior cord. The long, or middle, subscapiilar nerve is seen at the lower border of the subscapularis muscle accompanying the sub- scapular artery, and ends in the latissimus dorsi. The two phorter subscapular nerves will be better dissected when the arm is removed; the upper enters the subscapularis, the lower the subscapularis and teres major muscles. The Posterior or long thoracic nerve (external respiratory of Bell) (Fig. 6, 16) lies upon the serratus magnus, giving off a twig to each seiTation. It is a supra-clavicular branch of the brachial plexus, derived from the fifth, sixth and seventh cervical nerves, and descends behind the brachial cords and axillary vessels to its distribution. The Serratus Magnus (Fig. 6, 32) covers the side of the chest, arisiny by nine digitations from the outer surfaces of the eight or nine upper ribs and from the intercostal fascia, the first digitation being attached to the first and second ribs (joining on the latter the second digitation) and to a fibrous arch bridging the first intercostal space. The fibres have a general direction backwards to a special area upon the ventral surface of the scapula bordering the vertebral margin, where they are inserted, the first two digita- tions uniting to form a thicker portion which is attached to the upper angle, while the last four or five (the lower three of which interdigitate with the external oblique muscle of the abdomen) form a still larger bundle, corresponding to the broader jjortion of the area adjoining the inferior angle of the scaprUa, the inter- mediate portion having a slender attachment to the vertebral border of the scapula between the thick upjier and lower attach- ments. Action.—The muscle as a whole draws forward the scapula and with it the whole of the shoulder girdle, the centre of tho move- ment being at the sterno-clavicular joint. The lower digitations acting alone draw forward the lower angle of the scai)ula, and so rotate tho glenoid cavity upwui-ds and aid in the elevation of the arm, this motion occurring at the acromio-clavicular articulation. The muscle has no influence upon the respiratory movements. Its essential uses are in reaching, pushing or striking in a forward direction, and in raising tho arm. With the rhomboids, it keeps tho vertebral border of the bone appUed to the chest wall.22 TRK AXILLA. jTig. (3.—The uerves of the iixilL 1. Scalenus medius. 2. ScalenuK luiticiis. 3.

Fig. 7. liisrrtions of the Latissimns Bvrsi and Teres 3£aJoi:—The upper part of the latissimiis winds over the lower angle of the scapula, which it envelopes in a sort of fold, and ends in a broad, thm tendon, which passes in fi'ont of the teres major to be inserted into the bottom of the bicipital groove of the humerus. As ui the case of the lower portion of the pectoraUs major, the fibres of the muscle are twisted so that those which were highest at their origin are lowest at their insertion, and vice versa; it is the narrowest .of the three tendons inserted into the bicipital groove. The teres major passes behind the tendon of the latissimus dorsi, and is inserted into the inner or posterior edge of the bicipital groove oppo- site the pectoralis major, being separated by a bm-sa from the insertion of the latissimus. Opportunity should be taken, when the clavicle is divided by the dissector of the neck, to trace the axillary nerves to their origins and to study the brachial plexus, the description of which is given with the " Posterior Triangle."

[An incision is to be made down the front of the arm to a point three inches below the bend of the elbow, where it is to be joined by a transverse cut half round the fore-arm, and the skin is to be reflected on each side for a couple of inches, to allow of the dissection of the superficial nerves and veins. The intercosto-humeral nerve supplies the inner and posterior part of the ai-m in the upper half. The veins of the arm are very variable, and the best way of dis- sectino- them, therefore, will be to follow both basilic and cephalic veins "down to the elbow, and to trace out theii- tributaries. The internal cutaneous nerve will be found near the basilic vein, and internal to it the nerve of Wrisberg, the intercosto-humeral, and the ijiternal cutaneous of the musculo-spiral. With the median cephalic vein is the external cutaneous nerve, above and outside this are two external cutaneous branches of the musculo-spiral; and near the deltoid may be seen some twigs of the cii-cumflex nerve. The deep fascia is not to be removed.] The Internal Cixtaneous Nerve (Fig. 7, 8) is to be followed out from the inner cord of the plexus to the fore-ann. It lies at first in front or to the inner side of the axillary artery, and then, piercing the deep fascia about the middle of the ai-m, at or near the point at which the basilic vein enters, it runs in front of the inner condyle and, subdividing, sends branches both over and under the median basilic vein to the inner side of the fore-ann. A posterior branch winds above the inner condyle to the back of the fore-arm. „ ttt ■ -u The Lesser Internal Cutaneous Nerve (Nerve of Wrisberg; (Fig. 7, 2), after joining with the intercosto-humeral nerve, pierces the fascia 'at a variable point, and suppUes the lower thii-d of the inner side of the upper arm behind the internal cutaneous nerve. It is not always present. The Internal Cutaneous Branch of the Musculo-spiral Nerve (Fig. 7, 6) appears on the inner side of the upper arm.

The Median Vein (Fig. 7, 14), arising in a plexus above the wrist, runs up the centre of the fore-arm, and after receiving a deep vein (profunda) divides just below the elbow into two branches, the median basilic and median cephalic, which pass obliquely inwards and outwards respectively, to assist in forming the basilic and cephalic veins. The profunda vein pierces the deep fascia near the bend of the elbow to join the median near its point of bifurcation, and forms a communication between the veiue cumitcs of the ulnar artery and the superficial veins, the direction of the cm-rent of blood varying in different subjects. The Anterior and Posterior Ulnar Veins (Fig. 7, 12) end on the inner side of the fore-arm in a single trunk, which unites with the median basilic to form the basilic vein. The Basilic Vein (Fig. 7, 10) runs up the inner side of the arm to about its middle, where it pierces the deep fascia and is con- tinued up into the axillary vein, receiving, at a variable pomt, the venee comites of the brachial artery. To the inner side of the basiUc vein, and about an inch above the condyle, is a lymphatic gland of small size, which receives lymph from the inner part of the hand and fore-arm. The Radial Vein (Fig. 7, 11) ascends on the outer side to join the median cephalic and form the Ceplialic Vein (5), which passes lip the outer side of the biceps, and then between the pectoralis major and the deltoid; it has already been traced to its ter- mination in the axillary vein close to the outer border of the first rib. The Median Basilic Vein (Fig. 8, B.) has important relations, since it Kes superficial to the brachial artery, and crosses over or imder the internal cutaneous nerve. It is usually selected for venesection on account of its size. Somo protection is afforded to the artery beneath by the interposition of the bicipital or semi-lunar fascia, a tendinous expansion from the biceps (Fig. 0, a). The Median Cephalic Vein is usually of smaller size and crosses the tendon of the biceps, (jIoso to the outer side of which, and beneath the vein, the Musculo-cutaneous Nerve (Fig. 7, g) pierces the fascia and divides into its anterior and posterior branches to the fore-aim. The two external cutaneous branches of the Musculo- sjiiral nerve appear in the line of the extei'nal intermuscular septum close to the insertion of the deltoid, the up])or and smaller one accompanying the cephalic vein to the upper and outer part of tlie front of the fore-arm : the lower and larger one running behind theFRONT OF THE UPPER ARM. 26 external condyle of the humerus and supplying the skin on the posterior and outer part of the fore-arm as far as the wrist. The cutaneous hranches of the circumflex nerve emerge from beneath the posterior border of the deltoid, and supply the integu- ment over the lower third of that muscle. The Deep Fascia of the arm is sufficiently seen in following the superficial vessels and nerves. It is continuous with the fascia of the axiUa and fore-arm, and is attached to the supra-condylar ridges of the humerus, forming Fig. 10. the external and internal inter- muscular septa, which give attachment to muscular fibres. The intmial interniiucukir sep- tum is the stronger, and is pierced by the ulnar nerve and the iufeiior profunda and anas- tomotic arteries. The txternal is pierced by the musculo-spii-al nerve and the terminal branch of the superior profunda artery.

The loug or dutcr head, not to be fully traced at present, arises within the capsule of the shoulder-joint from the top of the glenoid cavity, and from the glenoid ligament. The Fig. 11. tendon traversing the joint and enclosed in a tube of synovial membrane, enters the bicipital groove of the humerus, and is seen to emerge from the capsular ligament and lie upon the tendon of the latissimus dorsi, and between the insertions of the pectoralis major and teres major muscles.

The fibres converge to a broad tendon, from which is given off, immediately above the elbow-jouit, an expansion, the bicipital or seiiii/anar fascia, re- ceiving superficial fibres from both heads, and inserted into the fascia on the upper and inner part of the fore-arm (22). This would have to be divided in order to follow the tendon of the biceps (15), which passes deej)ly to be inserted into the i)osteiior border of the bicipital tubercle of the radius, a bursa being placed between the tendon and the smooth anterior surface of the tubercle. It will be seen in a later dissection. The tendon becomes flattened near its insertion, and is twisted so that its vider edge becomes avierior. The chief action of the biceps is to supinate the fore-aim and to flex it upon the upper aim, the radius then representing a lever of the third order. The long head slightly abducts and flexes, the short head adducts and flexes the humerus. It is supplied by the musculo-cutaneous nerve. The Coraco-brachialis (Fig. 10,' 8) arises from the tip of the coracoid process, in common with, but to the inner side of, the short head of the biceps, from the tendinous upper part of which it also takes origin; and some of its innermost fibres are usually derived from an intermuscular septum connecting it with the pectoralis minor. It is pierced by the musculo-cutaneous nerve, which has previously given off branches for its supply, and is inserted into the inner side of the shaft of the humerus about its middle, opposite the insertion of the deltoid, and into a process of deep fascia continuous below with the internal intermuscular sep- tum, and extending upwards as far as the head of the humerus. It is a flexor and adductor of the humerus. The Brachialis anticus (Fig. 14,11) arises from the fi-ont of the shaft of the hiunerus in its lower half; and the fibres have also an extensive attachment to the front of the internal intermuscular septum, and a smaller one to the upper part of the external inter- muscular septum ; the origin is bifid above, the two slips embracing the insertion of the deltoid. It is inserted into a rough triangular impression on the front of the coronoid process of the ulna. It covers the front of the capsule of the elbow-joint, and is intimately connected with the anterior ligament. A considerable portion of the muscle appears superficially on the outer side of the arm between the biceps and triceps, but it is covered in front by the biceps, and is overlapped below by the supinator loiigus, extensor carpi radialis longior, and pronator radii teres. It is the directTnfdir.j). '2'.).]29 THE BRACHIAL ARTERY. flexor of the fore-arm upon the tipper arm, and is supplied by both the musculo-cutaneons and the musoulo-spiral nerves. The Brachial Artery (Figs. 12 & 13) is the direct continuation of the axillary, and extends from the lower border of the teres major to its point of bifurcation into radial and iilnar arteries, at the level of the jrmction of the head with the neck of the radius. The artery is super- ficial, or at least crossed by no muscle, in the whole of its coui-se, but may be overlapped by a well-developed biceps; and it gradually timis fi'om the riiner side of the arm to the middle of the bend of the elbow. In front it has the skin and fascite, with the internal cutaneous nerve until this pierces the fascia, and about the middle of the arm it is generally crossed by the median nerve (but the nerve may pass beneath the vessel); at the bend of the elbow it is also crossed by the bicipital fascia and the median basilic vein. Behind it has first the musculo-spiral nerve and superior profiuida vessels, which sepa- rate it fi-om the long head of the triceps; it then rests upon a small portion of the internal head of the triceps ; next, on the insertion of the coraco-brachialis ; and afterwards upon the brachialis anticus for the rest of its course. To the outej- side is the median nerve, with the coraco-brachialis muscle for a short distance above, and afterwards the biceps muscle, which is the guide to the vessel iii applying a lignture; both these muscles overlap the artery m a muscitlar ann. To the iuver side is the ulnar nerve, in close con- tact above, but soon leaving it to pass backwards to the hollow behind the internal condyle ; and afterwards, from a varying point, the median nerve, which' continues in close relation to the vessel for the rest of its coiu'se. The basilic vein lies to the inner side of the artery throughout its com-se, but is in closer contact in the upper part than the lower, i.e., after piercing the deep fascia. Venee comites suiTound the artery in its whole length. Fig. 12.—The axila land upper arm (from Maclise's Surgical Anatomy). 1. Median nerve. 2.2. Ulnar nerve. '6. Musculo-spiral nerve. A.

The Strpcrior profuiula, which comes off from the inner side of the artery just below the teres major, and immediately joining the miisculo-spii-al nerve, accompanies it between the outer and inner heads of the triceps and, under cover of the long head, round the humerus to end by a small anterior terminaJ branch between the brachialis anticus and supinator longus in front of the elbow, where it anastomoses with the radial recm*rent artery. It gives off a posterior medullary branch to the humerus and muscular branches, pi-incipally to the triceps ; also the posterior terminal or desr.cndinjj articular, larger than the anterior terminal artery, running behind the external intermuscular septum to the anconeus and back of the elbow, to anastomose with the posterior interosseous recurrent and anastomotic. 4. The Inferior prof unda, ^hich arises at a variable distance below the preceding or in common with it, and passes with the ulnar nerve through the internal intennuscular septum. It runs with the nerve to the groove between the inner condyle and the olecranon, and there joins the posterior branch of the anastomotic and the posterior ulnar recurrent artery. 5. The Anastomotic, which arises an inch and a half above the elbow and runs directly inwards, sending an anterior descending branch along the edge of the pronator radii teres to join the anterior ulnar recurrent; and then, piercing the internal inter-muscular septvim, gives off a posterior descending branch behind the internal condyle to anastomose with the inferior profunda and posterior ulnar recurrent arteries, and a large transverse branch to join the descending articular branch of the superior profiinda and the posterior interosseoiis reciu'rent behind the outer condyle. Irregularities of the Brachial Arterg.—The point of bifui-cation is occasionally much higher than the bend of the elbow, the abnormal branch being usually the radial, sometimes the ulnar, and more rarely the interosseous. Sometimes a vas aherrans leaves the brachial or axillary and, passing in front of the median nerve, joins either the radial or the ulnar, usually the former: or the bracbiiil may consist of two trunks, which unite before the final subdivision into radial and ulnar. If any of these arrangements bo present, two largo vessels will be met with side by side in some part of I he ann. The brachial artery is sometimes found passing with the median nerve through a fibrous canal beneath a process of bone above the inner condyle, the supracondylar process, to reach its nonnal position at the elbow. It is occasionally covered by a fleshy slip connected with the coraco-brachialis, biceps, brachialis anticus, or pronator teres; and other loss common peculiarities are sometiuies32 NERVES OF THE ARM. met with. The two profunda arteries not uncommonly arise together, and occasionally there is an axis common to all the prin- cipal branches of the brachial. Venae Comites are in close relation with the brachial artery, and receive twigs corresponding to its branches: they unite with the basilic to form the axillary vein. Nerves of the Arm. The Median Nerve (Fig. 14, 6) is derived fi'om the outer and inner cords of the brachial plexus by two roots, which embrace the axillary artery in the thii-d part of its course. The nerve afterwards lies to the outer side of the axHlary artery, and contmues in the same relation to the brachial artery for about half its length; then, crossing over (or occasionaUy under) that vessel, bes to its inner side, and continues in the same relation to the bend of the elbow It gives off no branch in the upper arm imtil it reaches the level of the interior condyle, where a smaU twig is detached for the supply of the pronator radii teres. It occasionaUy commumcates with the musculo-cutaneous nerve. ^ ■ . The Musculo-cutaneous Nerve (Fig. 14, i) arises fi-om the outer cord of the brachial plexus in common with the outer head ot the median, and lies to the outer side of the median nerve and the axillary vessels for a short distance. It fii'st supplies and then pierces the coraco-brachialis obUquely (hence called « /.erA'r«.. Cassern), and then lies between the biceps and the brachialis anticus^ both of which it supplies.

Branches to the triceps, anconeus and outer portion of the brachialis anticus will be seen in a .subsequent rhssection. Having pierced the external intermuscular septum, it runs down between the supi- nator longus and brachialis anticus, to both of which and to the extensor cai-jn radialis longior branches may be traced; and ends by dividing into radial and posterior interosseous nerves in front of the external condyle.

The teraiination of the brachial artery and the median nerve are to be cleaned in the middle line ; and at the outer side are to be defined the bifurcation of the musculo-spii-al nerve and an anastomosis between the superior profunda and the radial recui-rent arteries, and at the inner side an anastomosis between the anterior branch ot the Ficr. 15. anastomotic and the anterior ulnar reciu'rent, with some twigs fi-om the inferior profunda.] The Ante - cubital fossa (Kg. 15) is boimded above by an imaginary line di-awn across the arm above the condyles, and hehiw the apex is fonned by the meeting of the pronator teres and supinator longus, two inches below the joint. The er- termd boundary is the supinator longus, the internal the pronator teres ; whilst the floor is foi-med by the lower part of the brachi- aiis anticus, and external to this may be seen the oblique fibres of the supinator brevis, when the supinator longus is drawn aside. The relations of the superficial veins and nerves have been already examined (p ^b) and the contents of the space are now seen to be the median nerve, the brachial artery, and the tendon of the biceps which lie m that order from within outwards.

By slightly displacing the supinator longus outwards, the mus- culo-spiral nerve(3) will be seen lying between it and the brachialis anticus, and dividing into radial and posterior interosseous nerves; but this nerve is not, strictlj^ speaking, in the triangle. The radial nerve may be ti-aced for a short distance upon the supinator brevis, whilst the posterior interosseous to the inner side of the radial can be seen entering the fibres of the muscle. It is supposed that by the time the dissection of the bend of the elbow is finished the subject will be turned, in which case the student of the aim should dissect the first two layers of the muscles of the back (see Dissectiox of the Back), proceeding afterwards with the following dissections. If necessary, however, the dissec- tion of the front of the fore-arm may be proceeded with first. Since in some dissecting-rooms the dissector of the arm has no part in the back, the following dii-ections are given for the removal of the limb:— [The two superficial layers of the muscles of the back comprise the trapezius, latissimus dorsi, rhomboidei, and levator anguli scapula?. These having been divided, the supra-scapular artery and nerve and omo-hyoid muscle are to be traced to the upper border of the scapula, and the posterior scapular artery followed beneath the rhomboids. If the clavicle has been already divided in the dissection of the neck, the scapula can now be drawn away from the ribs and will be seen to be attached solely by the serratus magnus, between which and the ribs is a quantity of loose large- meshed areolar tissue, which allows the bone to glide smoothly upon the thorax. The serratus magnus having been divided, and the clavicle cut at its middle if still entire, the axillary vessels and nerves are to be severed after being tied together, and the entire limb removed from the trunk.] Parts about the Scapula. [The limb having been placed on the table, it is advisable to identify again the several insertions of muscles on the scapula, cutting each muscle about an inch from its attachment.] The insertion of the trapezius extends along the upper border of the spine of the scapula, the inner border of the acromion, and the outer third of the posterior border and upper surface of the clavicle. The omo-hyoid arises from the upper margin of the «capula close to the notch and from the transverse ligament. The I) 236 PARTS ABOUT THE SCAPULA. levator anguli scapulse is inserted into that part of the vertebral border of the scapula which is above the basal triangle at the root of the spine; the rhomboideus minor into the part opposite the basal triangle; and the rhomboideus major into the rest of the border, by means of a tendinous arch to which the muscular hbres are attached. The serratus magnus is mserted mto a special area running along the ventral sui-face of the scapula close to the verte- bral border for its whole length, but the fibres are much thicker at the upper and lower angles than in the midcUe. The smaU insertion of the pectoralis minor is attached to the inner border and upper sui-face of the coracoid process, the tip of which process gives origin to the coraco-brachialis and the short head of the biceps. [A smaU block is now to be placed beneath the lower border of the Tcamila so as to put the deltoid on the sketch, and the SmiLder^o its fibres are then to be cleaned, notice bemg taken nn^e ortwo smaU branches of the cii-cnmflex nerve which turn ? und its posteiSr border, and of a few descending acromja/ twigs f^om the superficial branches of the cervical plexus (Fig. i) which supply the skin of the shoulder.] The Deltoid Muscle (Eig. 16, 6) arises from the anterior border of the outer third of the clavicle and the adjacent portion of he superior sui-face as far as the cm'ved deltoid ridge and f^^om the tip'nd outer edge of the acromion, and the lower hp of the spme ot the scapula.

The Sub-acromial Bursa lines the interval between the upper pai-t of the shoulder-joiat and the under surface of the deltoid, acromion process, and coraco-acroinial ligament. It thus forms an extensive sac, the enlargement of which may be confounded with disease of the joint. The Parts beneath, the Deltoid Muscle (Fig. 16) are—the Coraco-acromial ligament, the Coracoid process with the muscles attached to it, the Sub-acromial bm-sa, the lufra-spinatus, the Teres Minor and Major, the long head of the Triceps, the head and Fig. 16. neck of the humerus, and the circumflex vessels and nerve. The tip of the coracoid process lies close to the interval between the pectoralis major and deltoid, hni is usually overlapped by the latter.

(A triangular interval between the teres major and the long and external heads of the triceps must not be mistaken for this latter space.) The posterior circumflex vessels and cii-cumflex nerve pass through the quadrilateral space; the dorsahs scapulae vessels enter the triangular space to reach the uifi-a-spinous fossa; and the large musculo-spiral nerve, with the brachial artery in front of it, wiU be seen between the long and outer heads of the triceps. The Supra-spinatus Muscle (Fig. 16, 3) occupies the supra- spinal fossa, arisiuf/ from the inner two-thii-ds of the fossa itself, from the upper sui'face of the spiiie, and from the fascia covering the muscle. The tendon passes beneath the acromion to be inserted into the uppermost facet on the great tuberosity of the humerus, and slightly iiato the capsular ligament of the shoidder-joint. In order to follow the tendon thoroughly, the acromial end of the spine of the scapula is to be divided with the saw, when a part of the subacromial bm-sa, before mentioned, will be found between it and the muscle. The Infra-spinatus Muscle (Fig. 16, 5) arises from the inner two-thirds of the infra-spinal fossa (the part near the neck of the scapula being fi'ee from muscular attachments in all the scapular fossEB), from the fascia covering the muscle, and fi'om the inter- muscular septa between it and the teres muscles. It is inserfe'l into the middle facet on the great tuberosity of the humerus and into the capsule of the shoulder-joint, being blended there with the supra- spinatus and teres minor. It is occasionally separated from the capsule by a biu'sa. The supra- and infra-spinatus muscles are supplied by the supra-scapular nerve. The Teres Minor Muscle (Fig. 16, 9) is closely connected with the infi-a-spinatus. It arises from an impression on the axiUary border of the infra-spinal fossa of the scapula reaching from the glenoid fossa to the impression for the teres major, from the fascia covering the muscle, and from the intei-muscular sepfci between it and the infra-spinatus and teres major muscles ; and is ,merted mU> the lowest facet on the great tuberosity of the humerus and for nearly an inch below it, and also into the capsular Ugament of the shoulder. It is sui^died by a special branch of the cu'cumflex39 THE SUPRA-SCAPULAR AKTERV. uerve, which is remarkable for having an enlargement upon it depending upon a thickening of the perineural connective tissue. The supra-spinatus is an abductur, and the infra-spinatus and teres minor muscles are external rotators and abductors, of the humerus. The Teres Major Muscle (Fig. 16, 7) arises from a quadrilateral impression at the inferior angle of the infra-spinal fossa of the scai^ula, and from the intermuscular septa between it and the teres minor and infra-spinatus muscles. Its close relation to the latissi- mus dorsi has been already noticed, but its insertion into the inner lip of the bicipital groove and the bm-sa between it and the tendon of the latissimus should be again clearly seen. It is swpplicd by the lower subscapidar nerve, and is an adductor and internal rotator of the humerus. The Posterior Circumflex Artery (Fig. 16, 4) with its veins, and the Circumflex Nerve (Fig. 16, 2), appear through the quadrilateral space. The nerve is distributed to the deep surface of the deltoid muscle, and to the teres minor muscle (the branch presenting the above-mentioned enlargement), and supplies also the shoulder-joint, and the skin over the lower part of the deltoid and back of the arm. The posterior circumflex artery not in- frequently arises from, or in common with, the superior profunda, in which case it is below instead of above the teres major. It supplies the same jjarts as the nerve. The Dorsalis Scapulae Artery (dorsal branch of subscapular) (Fig. 16, 11) does not pass through the triangular space as seen from behind, but winds beneath the teres minor in a groove on the axillary border of the scapula, to supply the infra-spinal fossa and anastomose with the posterior scapular and supra-scapular arteries. It gives off a ventral iitfni-scapular branch, which will be after- wards traced beneath the subscaj)ularis, and a superficial branch, which runs between the teres major and minor and down to the angle of the scapula, to anastomose with the subscapular and posterior scapular arteries. [The supra-spinatus and infra-spinatus are to be divided near their insertions, and the muscular fibres cleared out of the supra- spinal fossa in order to see the supra-scapular artery and nerve and the origin of the omo-hyoid muscle.] The Supra- scapular or Transversalis humeri Artery (from the thyroid axis) passes over the transverse ligament of the scapida and is distributed to the supra-spinal fossa, and also to part of the infra-spinal fossa by a branch which winds around the40 PARTS ABOUT THE SOAPULA. external border of the spine, and anastomoses with the dorsalis scapnlfB and posterior scapular arteries. Before crossing the liga- ment it sends a sapra-acromial branch through the attachment of the trapezius, and a suhsccqndar twig to the venter of the scapula. The Supra-scapular Nerve (Fig. 16, i) (from the anteiior branches of the oth and 6th cervical nerves) gives a branch to the shoulder-joint and passes through the supra-scap^ilar notch and beneath the ligament, to be distributed to the supra- and infra- spinatus muscles. • i * ^i. The Omo-hyoid Muscle arises horn about half an mch of the superior border of the scapula, immediately behind the supra- scmnilar notch, and from the ti-ansverse or posterior Ugament oyer it. Its relations and insertion are seen in the dissection of the neck. TThe limb is to be tui-ued over and the humerus rotated outwards to put the fibres of the subscapularis on the stretch; they should then be cleaned, care being taken of the subscapular nerves enter- in fthe muscle. The axillary vessels and nerves should be tied to the coiaS process, so as to'bring them as nearly as may be mto their proper positions.] The Subscapularis Muscle (Fig. 10, lo) is covered by a thin fascia, and has been already seen to form part of the posterior wall of the axQla. It arises fi-om the whole of the venter scapulje, except the part to which the serratus magnus is attached and the portion nearest the neck of the bone, and has seveml tenchnous septa between its fibres, which are attached to the ridges on the sm-face of the bone and bear some resemblance to those of the deltoid It is inserted into the lesser tuberosity of the humerus and he bone below it for an inch, and into the capsular hgament of the shoulder- joint, a large bursa intervening between the muscle aiid the neck of the scapula, which almost always communicates with the ca^nty of the joint over the upper border of the tendon. The subscapulari. is an iiternal rotator and adductor of the humerus, and is supphed by the short subscapular nerves. . ^ An important action of the supra- and infi-a-spinati, teres mmoi and subscapiUaris muscles is their combination to keep t^^^ ^ead of the humerus in its proper relation to the glenoid ^^^^ty and thus prevent dislocation. In the post-mortem relaxed condition of the Lrts, the head of the hiuiierus can bo drawn away from the glenoid cavity to the full extent of the loose capsular hgament The Subscapular Nerves (Fig. 6) ai-e branches of t^e P- c.rd of the brachial plexus, and are throe in niunber. The long or41 THE BACK Of THE ARM. middle subscapular uerve has been already seen in the axilla, and can still be traced to the latissimus dorsi; the short subscapular nerves (upper and lower) are now to be followed, the upper to the subscapularis muscle, the lower to the subscapularis and teres major. The Subscapular Artery (p. 17) is still to be seen running along the axillary border of the scapula, and its branches should be thoroughly followed out. The Infra-scapular Artery is derived fi-om the dorsal branch of the subscapular artery. It passes into the venter scapiilEe, beneath the subscapularis muscle, which must be divided to expose it, and anastomoses with the neighbom-ing vessels. The Posterior Scapular Artery is to be found between the serratus magnus and the rhomboidei, and its anastomoses upon the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the scapula should be defined. By removing the muscular fibres from both surfaces of the scapula a verj" abundant network of vessels will be seen, formed by anastomosing branches from the arteries wbich have been already traced to the scapula ; viz., the subscapular with its dorsal branch [axillary], the supra-scapular [thp'oid axis], and the posterior scapular [thyroid axis or subclavian]. The Back of the Arm. [The fore-arm and hand are to be doubled under the upper aim, which is to be placed on the table with the back upwards, and the scapula is to be drawn down with hooks so as to put the triceps on the stretch. When the skin has been removed from the back of the ai-m, two external cutaneous branches of the musculo-spiral nerve should be noticed.] Cutaneous Nerves.—The iqyper external cutaneous branch of the mmmlo-spiral (Fig. 7, 7) appears aboiit the middle of the outer side of the arm, and rans downwards and forwards along the cephalic vein to the upper part of the fore-arm ; the luwtr external, of larger size (Fig. 17, 6), appears close above the external condyle, and will be afterwards traced down the liack of the fore-arm to the wri.st; and the thii'd or interual cutaneous branch pierces the fascia near the tendon of the teres major, and supplies an ai'ea on the inner side of the arm behind that of the intercosto-humeral nerve (Fig. 7, 6). Branches from the internal cutaneouB and lesser internal cutaneona nerves will be found on the inner side of the limb, and filaments ofTHE BACK OF THE ARM. 42 tlie circumflex nervo run downwarclis ovor the back of tlie arm, and upwards over the lower part of the deltoid (Fig. 17). [When the strong deep fascia of the arm has been divided, the fibres of the triceps muscle should be cleaned, and a large bm'sa between the triangular posterior surface of the ulna and the skin should be noticed.] The Triceps Muscle (Fig. 17) has three heads—the long or middle, the external, and the internal. The Joikj (ii) head ai-ises from a somewhat tri- angular rough siu-face on the axillary border of the scapula immediately below the glenoid cavity, and from the adjacent capsular ligament of the shoulder-joint. It has been already partly examined both from the front and fi-om behind in relation with certain spaces (pp. 17, 'iS), and its fibres are now seen to be sepai'ated by another somewhat triangular interval from the back of the upper third of the humerus, ■until it joins the external head at the junction of the upper with the middle thii-d of the bone. The outer head (4) arises from immediately below the Yig. 17.—Dissection of back of upper arm (from Hirschfeld and Leveille). 1. Infra-spiuatiis. 2. Deltoid. 3. Teres minor. 4.

It forms a tendinous arch over the muscido-spiral nerve. The inner head (13) arisva fi'om the whole of the jiosterior aspect of the humerus below the insertion of the teres major and the musculo-spii'al groove, to within half an inch of the elbow-joint on the inner side, and extending to the back of the con- dyle on the outer side: fibres also arise from the external and internal intermuscular septa which intervene between it and muscles of the front of the arm. The whole of the fibres converge to a strong tendon, which is inserted into the posterior margin of the top of the olecranon jjrocess of the ulna, and into the deep fascia of the fore-arm by means of a strong prolongation, which lies over the anconeus muscle, and is fixed to the posteiior border of the ulna; while a fasciculus detached from its deep sm'face is attached to the back of the capsule of the elbow-joint, and is known as the suh-auconeus. A small bursa intervenes between the tendon and the forepart of the olecranon pi'ocess, which will be seen when the joint is opened. The triceps is the great extensor of the fore-arm upon the upper arm, and its action is that of a force applied to a lever of the first order. The long head also adducts and draws backwards the humerus. It is si/pplied by the musculo-spiral nerve. [The long head being hooked to the inner side, and the musculo- spiral nerve having been put on the stretch, the fibres of the outer head are to be divided as they blend with those of the inner head in order to follow the nerve, with the superior profunda artery, round the bone.] The Musoulo-spiral Nerve (Fig. 17, g)has been already shown (p. 32) to be a branch of the posterior cord of the brachial plexus, and has been seen to disappear between the internal and middle heads of the triceps; it can now be followed iu the oblique groove on the back of the humerus between the inner and outer heads of the muscle, until it reaches th(! interval between the supinator longus and brachialis anticus. It gives off numerous large branches to the triceps in its course, and afterwards supplies the suiiinator longus, extensor carpii radialis longior, brachialis anticus (in part), and the anconcius; and the branch to the last muscle with an accompanying artery should be at once traced through the fibres of the triceps at the back of the external (condyle. The branch to the inner head of the triceps is known as the nlnar collateral of Krause, because it descends in close relation to the ulnar nerve. The cutaneous branches have been described at p. 41.44 the; front of the fore-arm. The Superior Profunda branch of the brachial ai-tery acccom- panies the musculo-spu-al nerve aroimd the bone, and supplies the triceps in its coui-se. Beneath the muscle a branch ascends to anastomose with the posterior circumflex artery. At the umer edge of the triceps it gives off a rather large branch, the descendiiijj articular, which runs down to the back of the elbow beneath the triceps close to the external intermuscular septum, to anas- tomose with the posterior inter- osseous reciu-rent and with the anastomotic and inferior pro- funda arteries.

The Anterior Ulnar Vein (lo) is regular in its course, and will be found to commence in one or two small branches about the inner side of the wi-ist; then running along the inner side of the fore-arm, it joins the posterior ulnar vein near the elbow, and assists in forming the basilic vein. The Posterior Ulnar Vei)! (8) arises from the inner side of the dorsal plexus over the 3rd, 4th, and 5th metacarpal bones. The Median Vein (9) commences ia front of the wrist near the root of the thumb, coursing obliquely to the centre of the limb near the bend of the elbow, where it is joined by the profunda vein and divides into median basilic and median cephalic branches (p. 25). The Radial Vein. (7) commences at the back of the hand from the outer side of the dorsal plexus, and appears on the radial side of the fore-arm about its middle. It has been seen to unite with the median cephalic to form the cephalic vein (p. 25). Besides these named veias there are numerous smaller branches which assist, and occasionally take the place of, the larger ones. The Cutaneous Nerves (Fig. 18) are now to be followed out. The Internal cutaneous nerve (4) can be traced to the whole of the inner side of the fore-arm, the branches winding round to the back of the limb. It sometimes forms a junction with the following— The palmar cutaneous branch of the Ulnar nerve (12) may be found piercing the fascia about a hand's breadth above the wi'ist, close to the radial edge of the flexor carpi ulnaris tendon, and traced to the ulnar side of the palm. The External cutaneous (musculo-cutaneous) nerve (5) is distri- buted to the radial side of the fore-arm by two branches:—the anterior, accompanying the radial vein, is distributed on the anterior aspect and ends on the ball of the thumb ; the 2>osierior reaches the back of the fore-arm, and, after joining the radial nerve, ends at the level of the wrist. The pa/mwr cutaneous branch of the Median nerve (14) pierces the fascia in the centre of the fore-arm about two inches above the wrist, and passes to the palm of the hand, communicating with the palmar cutaneous branch of the ulnar. The Deep fascia is now to be cleaned, !uid will be found to bo continuous with the deep fascia of the arm above, and with the annular ligament below. It gives off intermuscular septa, which are attached deeply to ridges upon the radius and ulna, give origin to muscular fibres, and form sheaths for the muscles and tendons.THE FRONT OF THE FORE-ARM. 46 In a thin subject these are seen as white lines, running more or less in the direction of the long axis of the limb. [The muscles arising from the internal condyle are to be cleaned as far as possible without disturbing them; a small jjart only of the Eexor sublimis will be thus exposed. The edge of the supinator longus is also to be cleaned. Fig. 19.

The median nerve will ajDpear be- tween the tendons of the flexor carpi radialis and flexor sub- limis, and to the radial side of the latter.] The Muscles (Fig. 19) arising from the inner condyle are five in number, foui' being flexors of the carpus and fingers, and one a pronator of the radius. Be- ginning from the outer side, their relative jjositions are:— I, pronator teres ; 2, flexor caiiii Fig. 19.—Superficial dissection of fore- arm and hand (from Bonamy and Beau). 1. Bicei^s. 2.

All these muscles have a common origin from (1) the internal condyle, (2) the fascia of the fore-arm, and (3) the intermuscular septa derived from it; but three of them, viz., the pronator teres, flexor sublimis digitorum, and flexor carpi ulnaris, have extra bony attachments. The Pronator Radii Teres (Fig. 19, 8) arises from the internal condj-le above the other muscles, and from half an inch or an inch of the supra-condylar ridge; from the fascia of the fore-arm over it; and fr-om the intennuscular septum between it and the flexor carpi radialis ; and by a second head from the ridge on the inner side of the coronoid process of the ulna below the ulnar origin of the flexor sublimis. The median nerve lies between the two heads, the ulnar artery beneath them. It is inserted by a broad tendon into the middle of the outer side of the radius, immediately below the supinator brevis. It pronates the hand by rolling the radius on the ulna, and flexes the elbow ; and is sit-piilied by the highest branch of the median nerve. The Flexor Carpi Radialis (Fig. 19, 7) arises fiom the internal condyle in common with the other muscles ; from the fascia of the fore-arm ; and fr-om the intennuscular septa between it aiid the pronator teres on one side, and the palmaris lougus and flexor sublimis on the other. It ends about the middle of the fore-arm in a broad tendon, which soon becomes rounded, and disappears at the root of the thumb, piercing the external attachment of the annular ligament and passing through the groove in the trapezium, to be inserted into the base of the second, and slightly into the base of the third metacarpal bone. It is a flexor, an abductor and a pronator of the hand, and a slight flexor of the elbow. As a flexor of the wrist it acts upon both the radio-carpal and intercarpal joints. It is supplied by the median nerve. The Palmaris Longus (Fig. 19, 12) arises from the common attachment to the inner condyle; from the fascia of the fore-arm ; and from the intennuscular septa on each side of and beneath it. Its long and nari'ow tendon passes superficially to be inserted into the annular ligament, and terminates by expanding into the radiat- ing palmar fascia in the centre of the hand. It serves to make tense the palmar fascia and thus i)rotect the deep structures in the palm. It slightly flexes the hand and elbow, and fixes the annular ligament during the action of the mirscles of the thumb and little finger. It is supplied, by the median nerve. The palmaris longus is subject to great variations ; it is freijuently wanting, but is sometimes largely developed, its muscular bellyTHE FRONT OF THE FORE-ARM. 48 may be displaced downwards to tlie middle or lower part of the fore-arm, or may be double; and tbere are many in-egularities iii its insertion.

The ulnar nerve enters the fore-arm between the two origins of this muscle; the dorsal cutaneous branch of the ulnar winds beneath it in the lower third of the fore-arm; and the ulnar vessels and nerve lie beneath the muscle in the middle third of the fore-arm, and to the radial side of its tendon in the lower third. It is the only muscle inserted directly into one of the carpal bones, and is a flexor of the carpus and of the carjjo-metacarpal joint of the little finger, an adductor of the hand, and fixes the pisiform bone and annular ligament dm-ing the actions of the muscles of the little finger. It is supplied by the ulnar nerve. The Radial Artery (Fig. 19, g), the smaller of the divisions of the brachial artery, extends in the fore-arm fi-om the bifurcation at the bend of the elbow to the front of the styloid process of the radius. It is superficial in the whole of this course, except where it is more or less overlapped by the sui^inator longus muscle. It lies between the supinator longus and the pronator teres above, and, in the lower half of the fore-arm, between the tendons of the supinator longus and flexor carpi radialis, which latter tendon is here generally taken as the guide to the vessel. To its o«fe?- side is the radial nerve, which in the upper thii'd of the arm is at some Httle distance, in the middle third sometimes touches the artery, and in the lower third quits the vessel altogether to -pasa beneath the supinator longus. Beneath the radial artery are (1) the tendon of the biceps (if the bifurcation takes place in the ordinary position); (2) the supinator brevis; (3) the insertion of the jDi'onator teres; (4) the radial origin of the flexor sublimis; (5) the flexor longus pollicis; (6) the pronator quadratus; and (7) the end of the radius. It has two venje comites and gives off the following branches:— Branches.—1. The radial recurrent (Fig. 21, g) runs outwards beneath the supinator longus and gives ascending and descending branches, the former anastomosing with the termination of the superior profunda branch of the brachial artery. 2. Mimcidur brunches are given off at various points to the adjacent muscles. ■i. The superficial volar (21) arises near the root of the thumb and is of variable size. It runs forward, and generally beneath some of the fibres of the abductor pollicis, to complete the superficial palmar arch formed by the ulnar artery.50 THE FRONT OF THE FOUE-ARM. 4 The a,derwr carpal is a smaU bl-anch which runs across th. wiist beneath the deep tendons, to join a ^'l^'^f^^^^.l^'^tt^^^^ the ulnar artery at the level of the lower border of the pionatoi quaLtus.

J The Flexor Sublimis Digitorum (perforatus) (Fig. 20 i6) is the o^v muscle of the fore-arm which has its origin from the three the f internal condyle of the humerus IXtX^To;. the Xnal lateral ligament of the elbow; from Jhe intermuscular septa betw een it and the more superhcial mu.cl tm a tubercle on the inner side of tl^e coronoid proce o he Xi above the pronator teres origin; and fi'om the whole of the ulna ^bov^ tne p ^^^^^ ^^^.^^^ formed by the bones and jomts of the J-j; ^i^,,, and structure, the ^^^^^^Z^^^^^^ otthe L^nd second strong transverse baiK^^to^^^^^^^^^ phalanges, and bj ^J^^^'^J "^^^ decussating diagonally across the articulations, some of ^^^^^^^ ,^,,th is lined by a front of the two -^^^f^ ^ f^pon the tendons and forms synovial membrane, which is ene j ,asruh,sa.

The tendon of the flexor sublimis (jDerforcatus) will be seen to divide on the first phalanx to give passage to the tendon of the flexor profundus (per- forans), the two slips uniting beneath the latter and dividing again to be hiserti'd into the ridges on the shaft of the second phalanx; while the tendon of the flexor profundus runs on to the base of the third phalanx. The flexor sublimis is a flexor of the middle and proximal phalanges and of the wrist; and is also a weak flexor of the elbow, but its chief action is upon the phalanx to which it is attached. It is sii.ppJicd by the median nerve. The position of the ulnar arterj% between the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris and the innermost tendon of the flexor sublimis in the lower half of the fore-arm, is now to be noticed, and, by a slight separation of the tendons, the ulnar nerve can be seen Ijdng close to the ulnar side of the artery. This is the point where the ulnar artery is usually tied. [The flexor sublimis is now to be divided near its origin and turned down without injuring the median nerve, from which a branch may be traced to the deep surface of the muscle.] The Deep Muscles (Fig. 21) of the fore-arm are the flexor long-US pollicis on the radial side, the flexor profundus digitorum on the ulnar side, and the pronator quadratus, a small square muscle with transverse fibres, to be afterwards seen above the carpus bj' drawing aside the tendons. These are now to be cleaned, vessels and nerves being carefullj-- preserved. The Flexor Longus Pollicis (Fig. 21, 15) arises from the whole of the anterior siu'face of the radius between the oblique line and the attachment of the pronator quadratus, and from the outer half of the interosseoiis membrane in nearly its whole length. It generally has a small additional origin, by a slip of variable size, from the inner side of the coronoid process of the ulna. The tendon, invested by its ovrn bursal sheath, passes beneath the annular ligament and through the palm of the hand between the two heads of the flexor brevis pollicis, to be inserted into the base of the tei-minal phalanx of the thumb. The /i(/(imeidnm vcujinaJe of this tendon is much weaker than those of the finger tendons, and its synovial lining is commonly continuous with the outer carpal bursa. The Flexor Profundus Digitorum (perforans) (Fig. 21, 24) arises from the anterior surface of the ulna between the insertion of the brachialis anticus (which it embraces) and the origin of the pronator quadratus; from the adjacent half of the interosseous E 2THE FRONT OF THE FORE-ARM. 52 membrane ; and from the npper two-thirds of the mner surface o the ulna, extending to the coronoid and olecranon processes and to the posterior border of the bone.

[By separating the flexor longus poUicis from the flexor profundus digitorum, the interosseous vessels and the anterior interosseous vessels aiid nerve, as well as the pronator quadratus muscle, will be displayed.] The tendons of the flexor sublimis and jirofundus are provided with bursal sheatlis common to the two; a carpal .sheath Ij'ing beneath the annular ligameiit and extending a little above and below it, and th'i/ital sheaths, one for each finger, Ij'ing within the theca, and extending more or less into the palm beyond the pro.Ki- mal side of the ligamentiim vaginale, especially in the case of the little finger, the digital sheath of which communicates with the carpal sheath. The bursal sheath of the thumb tendon commonly extends from above the annular ligament to the distal joint, but is occasionally divided into two jiarts by an interval opposite the metacarpal bone : in rare cases it communicates with the carpal sheaths of the finger tendons. The Pronator Quadratus (Fig. 21, 17) is the onlj' muscle in the arm whose fibres are transverse. It arises from the lower oblique line on the front of the ulna, below the origin of the flexor profundus, and is inserted into the whole of the front of the radius below the attachment of the flexor longus pollieis. This muscle is a powerfid pronator of the fore-arm, and is supplied by the anterior interosseous-branch of the median nerve. The Ulnar Artery (Fig. 21, 14) arises from the bifurcation of the brachial artery at the bend of the elbow, and at first takes an oblique com-se inwards beneath the median nerve (separated from it hj the deejj head of the pronator teres) and four of the muscles arising from the internal condjde (pronator teres, flexor carpi radialis, palmaris longus, flexor sublimis digitorum). It lies first u}ion the insoition of the brachialis anticus, then upon the flexor profundus digitoriun, being there bound down by a process of deep fascia. The ulnar nerve is in internal relation to the artery for the lower two-thii-ds of the fore-arm, and in the lower third both artery and nerve lie comjiarativcly .superficially between the tendons of the flexor carpi ulnaris and (he flexor sublimis; they both rest on the flexor profundus digitorum mitil they pass forward to the hand, between the annular ligani(int and a process from tlio tendon of the flexor carpi idnaris. Two vena; comites are in close relation with the artery. Brandies.—1.

The Posterior ulnar recurrent (12), larger than the antenor, is to be followed beneath the flexor sublimis and flexor carpi ulnaris to the back of the internal condyle, where, after passing between the heads of the flexor carpi ulnaris, it runs in the groove occupied by the ulnar nerve, and anastomoses with the inferior profunda and anastomotic arteries. 3. The Interosseous arten/ (18) is a short trunk arising about one inch from the commencement of the artery. It is dh-ected back- wards to the interosseous space, where it subcUvides into antenor and posterior interosseous branches. The posterior interosseous passes between the radius and ulna m the interval between the obUque and interosseous Ugaments to 3oin the posterior interosseous nerve at the back of the fore-arm, where it wiU be dissected. .1 j. j. x- The anterior interosseous (20) is to be followed down the fi'ont oi the interosseous membrane, where it will be found lying with the anterior interosseous branch of the median nerve between the flexor lono'us pollicis and flexor profundus digitorum, until it reaches the upper border of the pronator quadi-atus ; here it gives off a small branch which runs beneath the pronator quadi-atus to join tke anterior carpal rete, while the larger posterior branch pierces the interosseous membrane, and passes down beneath the extensor ■ tendons to ioiii the posterior carpal rete.

As soon us it enters the fore-anu it gives branches to the pronator teres, flexor carpi radialis, flexor sublimis digitorum, and palmaris longus, and, after crossing the ulnar artery, gives off the anterior interosseons nerve (25). This passes down the fi'ont of the interosseous membrane, giving branches to the flexor longus poUicis and the outer half of the flexor profundus digitorum, and the pronator qiiadratus, pj^ 22. finally reaching the fi-ont of the wrist-joint, where it gives a branch to the articulation.

The Ulnar Nerve (Pig. 22, 2) enters the fore-arm behind the internal condyle, by passing between the heads of the flexor carpi ulnaris. It Hes under cover of that muscle aud upon the flexor profundus digitorum for the whole of its course in the fore-ann; and about the middle third of the fore-arm comes into close relation with the iilnar artery, and, keeping to its ulnar side, accompanies it over the annular ligament into the pahn. Branches (Fig. 22).—The ulnar nerve gives small articular branches to the back of the elbow, and suppHes one and a half of the muscles of the forearm, viz., the flexor oarpi ulnaris and the inner half of the flexor profundus cHgitormn. In the lower third of the fore-arm the nerve gives a ilorml hranch (20), which turns backwards beneath the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris to be distributed to the back of the Httle and half the ring finger as far as the middle of their second phalanges, and sometuues replaces the adjoining branch of the radial. A cutaneous palmar branch of smaU size arises below the middle of the fore-ai-m, and, after running down in fi-ont of the uhiar artery becomes cutaneous close above the annular hgament, and is distributed to the skin of the palm on the uhaar side, communi- cating with the palmar cutaneous of the median. The Radial Nerve (Fig. 22, 13) is seen to aiise from the musculo-spii'al nerve opposite the elbow. It lies at first upon the supinator brevis, to the outer side of, and at some htt e chstance from, the radial artery; but in the middle third of the fore-arm it is in close relation with the artery on the pronator teres, and occa- sionally touches it, leaving the vessel at the lower third to cross beneath the tendon of the supinator longus to the back of the fore- arm and hand. . , , • .1 j. „ The Posterior Interosseous Nerve (Fig. 22. 7) is he outer terminal branch of the musculo-spiral; it runs for a short distance 1 the supinator brevis, here giving off branches for the suppb o that muscle and of the extensor carp, radmhs brcyior; it then wtds round the radius in the substance of the supinator brevi.. and its fm-ther course will be seen on the back of the fore-ann.

At the wiist, on the outer side, the large radial nerve (6) pierces the deep fascia in the lower thu'd of the fore- arm, and, after communicating with the musculo-cutaneous nerve, distributes digital branches to both sides of the thiunb, fore-finger, and middle finger, and to the radial side of the ring finger ; it forms in addi- tion a loop across the back of the hand with the dorsal hranch of the ulnar ne.rce (7), which ajjpears on the inner side of the wrist, at a point coiTesponding to the lower end of the ulna, and gives digital branches to both sides of the little finger and the ulnar side of the ring finger, joining the radial nerve across the back of the hand.

The Superficial Veins (Fig. 23) across the back of the meta- carpus originate in an irregular arch, from which arise the radial and posterior ulnar veins at its inner and outer extremities; these have akeady been ti-aced to the cephalic and basilic veins respec- tively. [The deep fascia is to be removed from the back of the fore-ai-ui and hand, with the exception of a band about an inch wide, which is to be left opposite the lower end of the radius, to form the posterior annular hicjament (Fig. 24, 15). The slender posterior interosseous artery to the outer side of the extensor carpi ubians is to be pre- served It will be found to be impossible to remove the fascia entii-ely near the elbow, where it is incorporated with the muscles. J Muscles of the Back of the Tore-arm (Fig. 24).—The fore- ai-m muscles arising fi'om and above the external condyle of the hiunerus are either extensors or supinators, and wiU be found m the following order, beginning fi-om the radial side:—1, supinator longus; 2, extensor carpi radiaHs longior ; 3, extensor carpi radiahs brevier; 4, extensor communis digitorum; 5, extensor mmum digiti- 6, extensor carpi ulnaris; and 7, anconeus (covered by fascia'prolonged from the triceps); another muscle, the supmator brevis, Ues under cover of the long muscles and will be seen later. Arising deeply from the bones of the ./b;'e-arm, mil be found torn- short extensor muscles, which hold the following position m relation to one another from the radial side:-!, extensor ossis mctacai-pi pollicis ; 2, extensor piimi internodii pollicis ; 3, extensor secundi internodii polUcis; 4, extensor indicis. The muscles arising from the himierus have additional origins from the fascia of the arm or from intermuscular septa derived from it; and two, viz., the extensor carpi ulnaris imd supinator brevis, have additional origins from the ulna. The Supinator Radii Longus (Fig. 24, 4) is a long muscle and has been already seen in great part in previous dissections ot the bend of the elbow and fore-arm. It arises from the upper two-thh'ds of the external supra-con.lylar ridge of the humerus, and from the external intermuscular septum of the arm, which separates it from the triceps; and is inserted into the base of the styloi.l process of the radius. Its tendon is crossed by two short extensors of the thumb at the annular Ugament, and the radial ncn e passes beneath it to reach the back of the hand. It is supphed by a59 EXTENSOll CARPI RADIALIS BUEVIOR. Fig. 24. special branch of the musculo-spii-al nerve. It is a powerful flexor of the fore-ai-m, and may also bring the radius into a position midwaj' between pronation and supination. The Extensor Carpi Radialis Longior (Fig. 24, 5, Fig. 25, 3) arises from the lower third of the external supra-condylar ridge and from the external intermuscular septum; its tendon passes beneath the extensors of the metacarpal bone and first phalanx of the thimib, and through the second division of the annular ligament, and having then been crossed by the tendon of the third extensor of the thumb, is inserted into the base of the 2nd metacarpal bone. The muscle aids the supinator longus in flexion of the fore-arm, and is an extensor and abductor of the hand at the radio-carpal and intercarjial joints. The Extensor Carpi Radialis Brevier (Fig. 24, 6), which is partly covered by the long extensor, cm'scs from the outer condyle of the humerus; from the external lateral hgament; from the fascia of the fore-arm, and from the intennuscular septiun between it and the extensor communis digitorum. Its tendon passes, with that of the long extensor, beneath the two extensors of the thumb and through the second division of the annular ligament; and lastly beneath the third extensor of the thumb, to be inserted into the styloid process on the base of the Pig. 24.—Superficial muscles of the back of tlie fore-arm (from Wilson). 1.

It is an extensor of both elbow and wrist joints and a sUgbt abductor of the hand. The Extensor Communis Digitorum (Fig. 24, 8) arisen from the external condyle with the preceding muscles; from the fascia of the fore-ann, and from the intermuscular septa on each side of it. It ends in three tendons, which pass through the fourth division of the annular ligament with the extensor indicis, and, the inner- most having subdivided, the fom- tendons thus formed are into the fingers in the following way :-Opposite the metacai-po- phalangeal joint each tendon receives slips on both sides from the interossei; it expands upon the phalanx, and is joined on the radial side by the tendon of the lumbricalis, finally its lateral portions are prolonged to the base of the thii'd phalanx, whilst the midcUe portion is attached to that of the second phalanx. The division into three slips figured on diagrams is somewhat artificial, and must be made with the scalpel, since the three parts are, in the natural state, united. The tendon of the cxUn.or in.bas joins the ulnar side of the first or outermost tendon opposite the first phalanx; the tendon to the ring finger is joined by oblique tendinous^shps to the tendons on each side; and the tendon to the litt e hnger joined by the two divisions of the extensor minimi digiti, both above and below the band uniting it with the tendon of the rmg 'Iheadion of this muscle is to extend the wrist and fingers, and in a very smaU degree the elbow. Its principal action, however, is upon the proximal phalanges (into which it is not directly inserted); the true extensors of the middle and ungual phalanges being the interossei and lumbricales. . , , ^ , The Extensor Minimi Digiti (Fig. 24, g) might be taken as a part of the common extensor, but it is separated from it by an intermuscular septum. It arises from the external condyle : h-om the fascia and from the intermuscular septa on each side ; and ii> tendon, after passing through the fifth division of the annular ligament in the groove between the radius and the ulna, and over the posterior inferior radio-ulnar ligament, is generally divided both slips being iuserted into the common expansion on the tii> phalanx of the Uttle finger, but the innermost ^-^^^^ '^ forward than its feUow (Fig. 27, 19). ^V^fir'''^^'^ dent ..xtension to the little finger, chiefly at the metacaipo phalangeal joint, and aids the extensor communis m other respect The Extensor Carpi Ulnaris (Fig. 24, 10) ur.ses from the back of the external con.lvle, from the fascia, and from tOie mtermusculai septa on each .side; and ha., an additional origin from an expansion61 THE ANCONEUS. attached to the posterior border of the ulna, the fibres covering, but not being attached to, the iuiier part of the posterior surface of the bone. The tendon passes through the sixth division of the annular ligament, and in a groove behind the styloid process of the ulna, to be inserted into the base of the metacarpal bone of the little finger (oth metacarpal bone). It is an extensor and adductor of the hand, a feeble extensor of the fore-arm, and extends the carpo-metacarpal joint of the little finger. It should be noted that all the flexors and extensors of the carpus are inserted, directly or indii-ectly, into the metncarpiis, and act upon the radio-carpal, intercarpal, and carpo-metacarpal articula- tions. The extensors of the fingers act most powerfully on the proximal phalanges, the two other phalanges being principally extended by the lumbricales and interossei; the radial extensors are also abductors, and the ulnar extensor is an adductor of the radio- carpal articulation, and the extensor carpi radialis longior assists the sujiinator longus as a flexor of the fore-ami, the rest being feeble extensors of the elbow. The extensor carpi radiaKs longior is supplied by the musculo-spiral nerve; all the others by the posterior interosseous nerve, a branch of the muscixlo-spiral. The Anconeus (Fig. 24, ii, Fig. 25, 4) is a small triangular muscle on the back of the elbow, which is apparently continuous with the tiiceps, but is separated from it by a narrow cellular interval. It is covered by an expansion from the tendon of the triceps, which must be removed to expose it. It arises fi-om the back of the external condyle of the humerus bj- a separate origin, and spreads out to its fleshy insertion into the triangular surface \vpon the outer side of the olecranon and posterior sm-face of the ulna above the superior oblique line. It is an extensor of the fore- arm, and is supplied by a branch of the musculo-spiral nerve, which pierces its iipper margin and is accompanied by a branch of the superior profunda artery. Its deep siu'face is in relation with the posterior interosseoiis recuri'ent vessels and with the capsule of the elbow and superior radio-ulnar joints (hence, when there is synovial effusion, the muscle appears unduly prominent). j^The long extensors must be divided about the middle and turned aside ill order to see the deep muscles thoroughly, but the supinator longus should be left uncut. The supinator brovis will require careful dissection beneath the origins of the other muscles, and the ann must be fully ]ironated in order to stretch the fibres whilst being cleaned. The posterior interosseous nerve piercing the muscle is to be carefully preserved, and its branches ti-aced to the extensors.] •THE BACK OF THE FORE-ARM. 62 The Supinator Brevis (Eig. 25, 9) is an oblique muscle, covered at the tipper part by a tendinous expansion, from which some of its fibres take their origin. It arises from the external lateral ligament of the elbow, a few fibres perhaps reaching the external condyle; from the back of the orbicular ligament of the radius; from the triangular space below the lesser sigmoid cavity of the ulna, and from the adjacent part of the posterior surface of the bone for a short cUstance. Its fasciculi sweep spii-ally around the radius, and are inserted into the upper third of that bone, extending to the inner margin of the neck, the outer margin of the bicipital tuber- osity, the oblique line, and the corresponding parts of the anterior, external, and posterior aspects of the bone. It is pierced by the posterior interosseous nerve (which supplies it), and the posteiior interosseous artery passes between it and the extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis. It is a powerful supinator of the radius on the ulna. % • t-u The Extensor Ossis Metacarpi PoUicis (Fig. 2o, 13) is the only one of the special extensors of the thumb which usually has an "origin from both bones of the fore-ami. It arises from the middle of the posterior surface of the radius for about two mches. the origin reaching across the bone from the interosseous hne to the attachments of the supinator brevis and pronator teres; fi'om a corresponding portion of the posterior sm-face of the interosseous membrane ; and from two inches of the middle of the outer- side of the posterior surface of the ulna, between the attachments of the supinator brevis and anconeus above, and the extensor secundi internodii below. The muscle becomes superficial between the extensors of the carpus and fingers, and having crossed the extensor carpi radialis longior and brevior, and the insertion of the supinator longus, it passes on the outer side of the styloid process of the radhis, through the first division of the posterior annular hgament and over the racUal artery, to be inserted mto the base of he metacai-pal bone of the thumb, sometimes sendmg a sbp to the trapezium and the short muscles of the thumb.

The Extensor Secundi Internodii PoUicis (Fig. 25, 8) arises from the middle of the outer half of the posterior surface of the ulna, between the origins of the extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis above and the indicator below, and from the ulnai' half of the correspond- ing portion of the interosseous membrane. Its tendon becomes superficial just above the annular Hgament, thi-ough which it passes very obliquely in a separate division (the third) ; then crossing the tendons of the long and short radial extensors and, the radial artery, it runs along the ulnar side of the extensor j)rimi internodii to be inserted into the base of the ter- minal i3halanx of the thumb. Its tendon receives fibrous processes (analogous to those given off to the finger extensors by the interossei) from the abductor Fig. 25.—Deep muscles of the back of the fore-arm (from Sappey). 1.

Its tendon is covered by those of the common extensor, and running through the fourth division of the annular ligament with them, joins the ulnar side ot the tendon to the fore-finger. Actions.—The extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis is not only an extensor and abductor of the metacarpal bone ot the thumb, but is also an extensor and abductor of the wi'ist, and by means of its ulnar fibres a shght supinator of the fore-ann. The eTiensor prrm,. internodv has similar actions upon the wi-ist, and extends the thumb at the carpo-metacarpal and metacarpo-phalangeal jomts. iHe extensor secundi internodfi acts upon the carpo-metacariial, meta- carpo-phalangeal and inter-phalangeal joints (m the latter case being reinforced by the conti-action of the two thenar muscles which send slips to its tendon), and aids also in supination of the The extensor indicis and extensor minimi digiti are accessory to the corresponding tendons of the extensor communis, and serve to give ii^ependent 'action to the two digits. All the short extensors are sminlii'd by the posterior interosseous nerve.

V 2 the radial artery at the wrist very commonly vary, but should be five in uumbor. 1. The Posterior carpal (17) is a small branch which runs trans- versely across the carpal bones beneath the tendons, to join the posterior carpal branch of the ulnar and form an arch, which is joined above by the terminal branches of the interosseous arteries. Prom this arise two dorsal interosseous arteries, which run on the thud and foui-th dorsal interosseous muscles, receive the corre- sponding perforating arteries, and bifurcate at the web of the lingers to form the dorsal digital arteries. They .anastomose at the web and on the fingers with the digital branches of the superficial palmar arch. 2. The Metacarpal (20) is the fh'st dorsal interosseous artery, and closely resembles the others. It runs on the second dorsal interosseous muscle. 3. The Dorsalis indicis (22) is a similar branch, which runs along the radial side of the metacarpal bone of the index finger. This is fi'equently replaced by a large artery which runs along the meta- carpal bone and divides into branches to the fore-finger and thuinb, being in fact the radialis indicis, a branch of the radial in the palm, arising earlier than usual. 4 and 5. The Dor sales pjollicis (24) are two small arteries which are distributed on the metacarpal bone of the thumb; one is often wanting. The Posterior carpal hraiich of the Ulnar artery (Kg. 27, 17) will be found appearing beneath the extensor carpi uluaris, and having completed the arch formed by the posterior carpal of the radial, it ends in a branch to the ulnar side of the fifth metacarpal bone. The Posterior Annular Lig-ament (Fig. 27) is a thickened portion of the deep fascia of the fore-arm and hand: it is attached to the ridges on the radius externally and posteriorly, and to the cuneiform and jHsiform bones internally. It has six subdivisions, which should be carefully examined and compared with the gi'ooves on the bones. The first division corvosi)onds to the groove on the outer side of the lower end of the radius, and transmits the tendons of the extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis and extensor piimi internodii pollicis ; the spcond division corresponds to the outermost groove on the back of the bono, and transmits the tendons of the long and short radial extensors of the wrist; the third division corresponds to the nari'ow deep oblique groove on the back of the radius, and transmits the tendon of the extensor secuiidi internodii pollicis ; the foiirt/i division, corresponding to the innermost broad grooveeg PALM OF THE HAND, on tlie radius, transmits the tendons of the extensor communis di-itorum and .of the extensor indicis; the fiM division corre- sponds to a very slight groove on the edge of the radius (or is placed between the bones), and transmits the tendon of the extensor minimi digiti; the sixth division corresponds to the oToove at the back of the styloid process of the ulna, and ? -i.^ j.i,„ i.r.^Ar.r^ fho fi^tfiiisor caroi ulnaris.

The Palmaris Brevis (Fig. 18, i6) is a small muscle running transversely below the pisiform bone and immediately beneath the skin. A7-ising fi'om the inner edge of the central fascia it crosses the ulnar artery and nerve, and is inserted into the skin on the inner side of the hand. It is supplied by the superficial division of the ulnar nerve. During its contraction it puckers the skin at its insertion, increases the prominence of the hypothenar eminence, and slightlj' deej^ens the hollow of the hand. [The central portion of the palmar fascia is to be detached from the annular ligament and tiu-ned down, care being taken not to injure the vessels and nerves which are close beneath; and these are then to be cleaned.] The Superficial Palmar Arch (Kg. 30, e) is the direct con- tinuation of the ulnar artery, which reaches the palm by passing over the annular ligament on the radial side of the pisiform bone, and beneath a little fibrous slip from the flexor carpi ulnaris (p. 53): it then lies between the palmar fascia and the tendons and nerves. The vessel is subject to very great variations, but if regular, forms an arch with the convexity forwards, reaching to about midway between the annular ligament and the root of the middle finger, as far as the middle of the three palmar furrows.

These branches traced along the sides of the digits will be found to supply the cutaneous structui-es, the sheaths of the tendons and the jomts, and to send twigs back to anastomose with the dorsal artenes; finaUy they supply the pulp of the terminal phalanx and form a plexus beneath the nail. They are accompanied by the digital nerves; but their relative positions differ in the pabn and m the fingers,—in the former the arteries are superficial, in the latter the nerves. . . , j. -i-i; i_: Each of the three outer digital arteries at its pomt of bifurcation receives a communicating twig from the interosseous branches of the deep arch (radial ai-tery), and an intermetacarpal branch fi-om the bifurcation of the dorsal digital arteries. The branch to the fore- finger inosculates with a branch on the other side of the finger also derived from the radial (radialis indicis). The Profunda Artery is a small communicating branch arismg from the ulnar artery as soon as it has crossed the annular Ugament. It passes deeply, with the deep branch of the ulnar nerve, between the abductor and the flexor brevis minimi digiti, and along tfie ulnar side of the unciform process. It wiU be found to complete the deep palmar arch of the radial artery. The median artery from the anterior interosseous (p. o4) is sometimes enlarged and joins the superficial pahnar arch or supphes digital branches. . , The Ulnar Nerve (Fig. 22, 2) accompames the iilnar aiterj over the annular Ugament, lying to its uhiar side, and unmediately divides into a superficial and a deep portion. The deep branch (22) accompanies the profunda branch of theulnar artery (7. v.) ^^pplymg the muscles of the little finger, and be seen again ui the deep dissection of tho palm. The snperficial division 26) sends a txM to the palmaris brevis and to the integument of the u nar side of the palm, and subdivides into two cUgital branches which supply one and a half fingers, the inner one running on the u^nar side 0 the little finger, and the other bifurcating at the roots of the fingexs into branches for the radial side of the little and ulnar side of the finger, the latter uniting with a branch of the median nerve.THE MEDIAN NERVE. 73 The digital nerves can be traced along the sides of the tendinous sheaths, lying superficially to the arteries and giving filaments to the pulp of the finger, dorsal twigs to the niati-ix of the nail, and others which unite with the dorsal digital nerves and supply almost entirely the skin over the backs of the second and third phalanges.* The Anterior Annular Ligament (Fig. 33, i) is the broad band of fascia binding down the flexor tendons at the wrist. It is attached on the outer side to the scaphoid bone and to both sides of the gi'oove on the trapezium (binding down the flexor carpi radialis tendon), and on the inner side to the unciform process of the unciform bone, and slightly to the pisiform bone. It is crossed by the ulnar vessels and nerve, the cutaneous palmar nerves, and the tendon of the palmaris longus, the deej) fibres of which are inserted into it; and the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris sends an expansion to it over the ulnar vessels and nerve. The outer attachment of the ligament gives passage to the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis, while beneath the ligament lie the median nerve, the tendons of the flexors of the thumb and fingers, and two carpal bursal sheaths, one for the tendon of the flexor longus poUicis, the other, larger and very complex, for the tendons of the superficial and deep finger flexors. These extend from just above the annular ligament to about the middle of the palm; the first generally, but not constantly, communicates with the digital bursal sheath of the thumb, and the second with that of the little finger. The Median Nerve (Fig. 22, 6) is flattened as it passes beneath the annirlar ligament superficially to the tendons, and divides into two ti-unks which subdivide into four digital nerves (33), to supply three and a half fingers. The first or outermost, after giving a small branch to supply the abductor, opponens, and outer head of the flexor brevis pollicis, bifurcates to supply the two sides of the palmar aspect of the thumb ; the second digital nerve supplies the radial side of the index-finger, after giving a small twig to the first liunbricalis muscle; the third, after supplying the second lumbricaLis, bifurcates near the roots of the fingers to supply the ulnar side of the index and the radial side of the middle fingers; the fourth bifurcates to supply the ulnar side of the middle finger . * It will be observod Unit the number of fingers supplied by Uie ulnar artery w the complement of that supplied by the w.rye, and that the same rule holds Witn respect to the radial artery and the median or radial nerves, thus : — Ulnar artery .... 31 fingers.

The digital branches are distributed, like those of the ulnar nerve, to the pulp on the palmar side of the digits and to the fetal half of the dorsal integument. TThe ulnar artery is to be divided beyond the origin of the proiunda and the ari tm-ned down as far as possAle ]>u the nerve mav be left uncut. The median nerve is to be divided at the ^vllst Zd tmied down, and the flexor tendons with the lumbricales ^tcS cleaned ami traced to their insertions. .Tl^e sheaths o^^ the flexor tendons have been already descnbed (p oO), but at least one S should be laid open in order that the tendons may be well seen.] The Tendons of the Flexor Sublitnis, foiu- in number pass beneath the annular ligament and he immediately beneath the branches of the median nerve in the palm.

The lumbricales act with the interossei as flexors of the first phalanges and extensors of the second and third phalanges. The first and second are supplied by branches of the median nerve ; the thii'd and foiu'th receive twigs from the deep branch of the ulnar nerve, which will be seen in the deeper dissection. The Tendon of the Flexor Longus Pollicis (Fig. 33, g) is on the same level as the tendons of the flexor profirndus, and can be ti'aced between the sesamoid bones and the two heads of the flexor brevis pollicis to the base of the teinninal phalanx of the thumb. Its vaginal ligament is much less strongly developed than those of the fingers. [The tendons of the flexor profundus are to be divided (but not the flexor longus polKcis) and tui-ned down with the lumbricales; the muscles of the little finger and thumb are to be carefully dissected.] Muscles of the Little Finger. The Abductor Minimi Digiti (Fig. 33, lo) is the most super- ficial and the innei-most of these. It arises from the pisifonn bone and slightly from the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris, and is inserted into the ulnar .side of the base of the first phalanx, giving a .small fibrous expansion to the ulnar side of the extensor tendon, opposite to the similar expansion derived from the third palmar interosseous. The Flexor Brevis Minimi Digiti (Fig. 33, 8) is often closely connected with the abductor; but the deep branches of the ulnar artery and nerve which pass between the two will serve as guides to the point of sejiaration. It arises from the unciform process of the unciform bone and from the annular ligament, and is inserted with the abductor into the base of the first phalanx. Actions.—The abductor and flexor brevis are flexors and abduc- tors of the first phabinx, and the former by its slip to the extensor tendon aids iji the extension of the second and third phalanges; both muscles act secondarily as flexors of the metacarpal bone. The Opponens (flexor ossis ractacarpi) Minimi Digiti is the deepest of the set, and arises from the unciform process close to the preceding muscle and from the annular ligament. It spreads into a triangular shape, and is ivse.rted into the inner margin of the shaft of the fifth metacarpal bone, thus resembling the opponens pollicisMUSCLES OF THE THUMB. 76 the most superficial of the series Fig. 33. as to insertion, but the power of " opposition" in the Httle finger is much more Umitecl than in the thiunb.

The Abductor Pollicis (Fig. 33, 2) is a slender muscle, and is - - ■ It arises from the annular liga- ment, and usually from the lidge on the trapezium and from the tubercle of the scaphoid. It is inserted into the outer side of the base of the first phalanx of the thumb, -with the outer half of the flexor brevis, and gives a fibrous expansion to join the side of the tendon of the extensor secundi internodii pollicis. The superficialis volffi artery com- monly runs through its fibres to join the superficial palmar arch. Its action is to abduct and flex the metacarpal bone, to flex the first phalanx, and by virtue of its expansion to the extensor tendon, to extend the ungual phalanx. It must be di\^ded to see the following:— The Opponens Pollicis (flexor ossis metacarpi polUcis) (Fig. 33, 3) arises from the ^'o;^* of the trapezium and from the annular Ugament, and is n.serted mto th. outer border of the shaft of the metacaiTal bone of the thumb.

The Flexor Brevis Pollicis (Fig. 33, 4) consists of two portions at its insertion, between which the tendon of the long flexor is placed, one, the outer or superficial head, being more or less con- joined with the abductor, iind the other deej)ly placed between the addiictor obliquus and the abductor indicis. The outer arises from the lower part of the annular ligament, and is inserted with the abductor into the outer side of the base of the first phalanx; a sesamoid bone being developed in its tendon. It is usually joined by an oblique slip from the adductor obhquus. The inner head, of veiy small size, arises from the tdnar side of the base of the first Fig. 34. metacarpal bone, and is f/iscrh'tl with the adductor obliquus. It has the asjDect of a small palmar interosseous muscle. The Adductor Obliquus Pollicis (Pig. 33, 5), formerly known as the inner head of the flexor brevis pollicis, arises from the bases of the second and third metacarpal bones, the sheath of the flexor carpi radialis, and the os magnum. It is I'nserinl, with the deep head of the flexor brevis and the adductor transversus, into the inner side of the base of the first phalanx, a sesamoid bone being developed in its tendon whore it plays over the head fif the nieta- caqxil bone ; it often gives an oblique slip beneath the long flexor Fig. 34.—Insertion of muse a.

The deep pahnar arch is buried in its fibres of origin, and emerges between it and the adjacent border of the adductor transversus. The Adductor Transversus Pollicis (Fig. 33, 6) arises from the narrow anterior surface of the lower two-thirds of the shaft of the middle metacarpal bone, and is inserted into the inner side of the base of the first phalanx of the thumb, and into the tendon of the extensor secundi internodii; the muscle foniiing a triangle with its base to the ulnar side. It necessarily covers the muscles m the first and second interosseous spaces (which may be seen m part at its anterior border), and will have to be divided to expose them. Of the muscles of the thumb, the abductor opponens and outer head of the flexor brevis pollicis are sup2'lied by the median, while the two adductors and the inner head of the flexor brevis polhcLS are supplied by the deep branch of the ulnar nerve. , . ^ ^ The Deep Branch of the Ulnar Nerve (Fig. 22, 22) is to be traced out, and will be found to arise fi-om the ulnar ti-unk near the pisiform bone, and to pass with the profunda vessels around the ulnar side of the root of the unciform process and between the flexor brevis and the abductor minimi digiti, giving branches to these muscles and to the opponens. It then foiins an arch across the bases of the metacarpal bones, accompanj-ing the deep palmar arch, and supplies the two innermost Inmbricales, the seven mterossei muscles (palmar and dorsal), the obhque and transverse adductors, and the deep head of the flexor brevis poUicis. The Deep Palmar Arch (Fig. 31), the termination of the radial artery, commences in the first interosseous space ^mediately after passin- through the interval between the two heads of the abductor ndicis It may be traced, with its venaj coniites, runnmg m the fibres of origin of the adductor obhquus pollicis to emerge between the adjacent borders of this muscle and the adductor transversus ^°ThTdeep arch has a slight convexity towards the fingers and is- placed at he junction of the bases with the shafts of the metacarpa bones. It is completed by anastomosis with the deep branch of the- ulnar artery. Its branches arc as follows:— ... I Frinceps pollicis, a large branch of uncertain origm, sometmie arising froi L radial at the back of the abductor indicis, but us3fy on the palmar side of the nuiscle; it passes along the meta- bone of he thumb, and then bifurcates to supply bo h side 0? the thiab superficially.

Small recurrtnt branches to the carpus, anastomosing with branches of the anterior carpal arch beneath the flexor tendons and annular ligament. 4. Three perforutimj arteries to the dorsum, jjassing between the heads of the three inner dorsal interosseous muscles to join the dorsal digital arteries. 5. Three interosseous arteries, which run on the three palmar interosseous muscles to the roots of the fingers, and then anastomose with the digital branches of the sujjerficial arch at their points of bifm'cation. They suj)plj' the interossei. The tendon of the Flexor carpi radiulis can now be easily traced thi-ough the groove in the trapezium to its insertion into the base of the second and third metacarpal bones. The Palmar Transverse Metacarpal Ligament passes in fi-ont of the heads of the metacarpal bones, and is closety connected with the sheaths of the flexor tendons and the glenoid plates of the metacarpo-phalangeal articulations. The lumbricales and the digital vessels and nerves pass in front of it to reach the fingers. It must be divided to follow out the interossei, which pass beneath it. The Dorsal Transverse Metacarpal Ligament is a compara- tively delicate band of fibres joining the heads of the metacarpal bones posterioilj^. The tendons of the interossei of each space run through a kind of sheath formed bj' the two transverse ligaments and the metacarpal bones which they connect. The Interosseous Muscles are seven in number, three palmar and four dorsal. Two of the palmar interossei are readily seen, but the adductor transversus pollicis must be entirolj' detached from the middle metacarpal bone in order to expose the remaining one. The Three palmar interossei (Fig. 35) are muscles placed in the three metacarpal spaces between thc! fingers, and are numbered 1st, 2nd, and 3rd from the radial side. They are arranged as ((f/ductors of the fingers to an imaginary line prolonged through th(^ middle metacarpal bono, as follows :—The 1st palmar interosseoTis muscle arhcH from the ulnar sid(! of the 2nd metacarpal bone, and is inserted into the ulnar side of the base of the corresponding first phalanx; the 2nd arises from the radial side of the 4th'rHiE INTEROSSEOUS MUSCLEB. 80 metacarpal bone, and is inserted into the radial ^ide of the corre- sponding fii'st phalanx; the 3rd wru<s8 from the radial side of the 5th metacarpal bone, and is inserted into the radial side of the corresponding first phalanx. Each mnscle also sends an impor- tant expansion to the adjacent side of the con-espondrng extensor tendon. , . .„ , The Four dorsal interossei (Fig. 36) are bipenniform muscles a/rising fi-om the adjacent sides of the metacarpal bones, and are Fig. 35.

Action.—The insertions into the base of the first phalanx (Fig. 37) enable the interossei to act as flexors of that phalanx, and to give lateral movement to the fingers to which they are attached. The slip (c) sent forward to join the extensor tendon extends the second and third phalanges; and thus the action of the interossei includes adduction to and abduction from the median line of the hand, with flexion of the first and extension of the second and third phalanges. Fig. 37. The lumbricales act in a similar manner, but have more power in initiating the flexion of the first phalanges, and they strengthen the radial side of the metacaz'po-phalangeal joints. The whole of the interossei are supplied by the deep branch of the ulnar nerve. [The interosseous muscles of the hand should be compared with those of the foot, when the same arrangement will be found to exist in both cases, with the exception that, in the foot, the imaginary lino for abduction and adduction is drawn through the long or second toe, the muscles being aiTanged in accordance.] Pig. 37.—Attachment of an interosseous muscle (from Duohenne). a: Interosseous muscle. c.

TThe muscles about the scapula are to be followed to their exact insertions and cut short; the deltoid and the remains of the trapezius must be carefully removed in order that the hgaments of the scapula and clavicle may be seen.] The Sterno-Clavicular Articulation is a double ginglymus betweea the inner end of the clavicle and the sternum and fii'st costal cartilage, and its cavity is subdivided into two parts by an Pig. 38. interarticular fibro-cartQage.

These structures are dissected witli the head and neck (see Anterior Triangle). The Acromio-Clavicular Articulation (Eig. 38) is an arthrodial joint, with an inter-articular fibro-cartilage, usually imperfect, but occasionally complete and dividing the synovial cavity into two parts. The joint fissure runs straight from before backwards, and the articular sui'faces of the bones are so bevelled as to favour upward displacement of the clavicle upon the acromion. The Superior acromio-davicular ligament (i) is a quadi'ilateral band of short strong fibres, more or less connected with the fibres of the trapezius and deltoid. It is in reality continuous with the inferior acromio-davrcular ligament, which is similar in shape, but placed below the joint, the two forming a capsule. The Coraco-Clavicular Ligament (Fig. 38, 2, 3) is really but one ligament twisted upon itself so as to present two surfaces, to which the names Conoid and Trapezoid have been given. The two parts are separated by the insertion of the subclavius and by a bursa. The Conoid ligament (3) is the posterior portion, and resembles a cone with the base upwards. It is attached to the posterior and inner part of the base of the coracoid process heloiv, and to the tubercle on the under surface of the clavicle and part of the adjacent bone above. The Trapezoid ligament (2) might be more suitably called rhom- boid from its shape. It is a quadrilateral band of fibres attached to the line on the posterior part of the upper surface of the coracoid process heloiu, and to the line leading to the tubercle on the under surface of the clavicle above. It is anterior and external to the conoid ligament. The Coraco-Acromial Ligament (Fig. 38, 4) is a triangular band attached to the outer side of the coracoid process, and by its smaller end to the tip of the acromion process, and often presents a cleft through which passes a vessel and occasionally a slip of the pectoralis minor. It arches above the shoulder-joint and prevents dislocation upwards. It is loosely stretched between its two attach- ments in order that it may adapt itself to the curve of the head of the humerus, for which it forms, together with the acromion, a supplementary socket. _ The Transverse Ligament (Fig. 38, 5) is a short band convert- ing the supra-scapular notch into a foramen, and giving origin to part of the omo-hyoid muscle. It is often divided into two'^parts by the supra-scapular vein. The supra-scapular artery goes over the ligament, but the nerve beneath it.84 THE SHOULDER JOINT. Movements of Clavicular Joints.-The sterm-clavicuM-joint is the centre lor the moTements of the entii-e shoulder girdle. It admits of motion of the clavicle forwards and backwards around a vertical axis, and upwards and downwards around an antero-postenor axis. The bone is raised, and with it the scapula and J^^erus, by the upper part of the trapezius, the clavicular head of the sterno- cleido-mastoid, the levator anguli scapulae and the ^omboids It is depressed by the weight of the arm, assisted by the subclavius, the pectoralis minor, the lower fibres of the ti-apezius, and (mdu-ectly, bylhe latissimus dorsi. It is drawn forward by the serratus magnus and the sternal fibres of the pectoralis major, and backward by the Aomboidei and trapezius. The two clavicular prnts thus share between them movements in aU directions. The movements of the acro^n^o-ciavic^dar joints are also very important. The scapula rotates around an axis passing thi-ou h the clavicular facet in the direction of the long axis of the clavicle and it is this movement which allows the forward -vement of^the arm to be carried above the level of the shoulder. The for^rd Nation causes the glenoid cavity to look -P^f^^^f^ it the humerus, and is effected by the lower digitations of the ser^l^Tagnu;, aided by the upper fibres of the trapezius; the opposite movement is due to the rhomboideus major. The Shottlder Joint. injuring it, and then cut short.] The shoulder is an euarthrodial or ball-and-socket joint, invested iHe snomaei =,,vrounded and strengthened by theTHE CAPSULAR LIGAMENT. 85 supra-spinatus, and the long head of the biceps. Rotation outwards is produced by the infra-spinatus and teres minor ; inwards by the subscapularis, teres major, latissimus dorsi, and pectoralis major muscles. The last two muscles are antagonistic in the fact that the pectoralis major draws the arm forward across the chest, after rotating it, whilst the latissimus dorsi draws it behind the back. The range of the movements of the humerus around the three axes —sagittal, frontal and ventral—is only from 90° to 100° for each. Abduction and flexion of the arm are hence effected only in part at the shoulder-joint, the rest of the movement taking place at the sterno and acromio-clavicular articulations. The Capsular Ligament (Fig. 38, 6) is seen to be loose, allow- ing partial dislocation of the humerus now that all the muscles are divided, and there is almost always an opening on its inner side above the subscapularis tendon, by which the bursa of the sub- scapularis communicates with the articular cavity. The capsule is attached above to the outer margin of the glenoid cavity of the scapula, and heloiu to the anatomical neck of the humerus, except on the inner side, where it is prolonged downwards as far as the sui-gical neck. It bridges across the bicipital groove, lea\dng- an aperture for the long tendon of the biceps (Fig. 38, 8). It is thickened in front by an accessory band of fibres, the Coraco-hiuneral lif/ament, attached above to the lower part of the posterior border of the coracoid process, and below to the greater tuberosity of the humerus. The GkHO-liumeral liijamcn.ts are accessory bands springing from the anterior border of the glenoid cavity, seen on opening the "Capsule from behind. The superior, narrow and rounded, is attached above to the U2)per part of the anterior margin of the glenoid .Cavity in front of the origin of the long head of the bicejis, and below to the upper part of the lesser tuberosity of the hunTerus. It is supjiQsed to rejiresent the ligamentiim teres of the lower extremity. The inferior gleno-humeral ligament, broad and strong, runs from the lower half of the anterior border of the glenoid cavity to the anterior and inner side of the neck of the humerus. A middle baud is sometimes described between tlie two foregoing, arising with the superior and attached below to the inner side of the lesser tuberosity. The tendon of the biceps is to be followed into the articuliition by luj'ing open the capsular ligament. It is invested by a tube of synovial membrane, and attached to the glenoid ligament and upper part of the glenoid cavity. Its synovial sheath can be demon- strated before the capsule is opened by making traction upon theTHE ELBOW JOINT. 86 tendon during flexion and abduction of tbe arm, when the lower portion of the tube emerges fi-om the bicipital opening (Fig. 11). The Glenoid Ligament is a fibrous ring continuous with the tendon of the biceps and attached around the border of the glenoid cavity, which it therefore deepens. There is a single Synovial Membrane in the shoulder-joint, which is reflected over the glenoid and capsular ligaments and around the tendon of the biceps. The Elbow-joint. [The muscles about the elbow are to be removed, and gi-eat care must be taken, in detaching the supinator brevis, not to remove or damage the external lateral and the orbicular ligaments Beneath the triceps close to the joint may be found a little slip of musculai- fibre attached to the lower end of the humerus and the back ot the joint- this is the Hubauconeus, which is however often wanting or but slightly developed. All the muscles of the fore-arm and hand should now be removed to faciUtate the examination of the wi-ist, &c In removing the deep muscles of the fore-ann, care must be taken not to injure the interosseous membrane and the oblique ligament.] The joint between the humerus and fore-arm bones, the elbow- joint proper, is almost a pm-e giugh/mns or hinge, and is provided with antei-ior, posterior, and lateral ligaments. The supenor radio- ulnar articulation, which is continuous with the elbow-jomt, is an example of diarthrosis rotatorius, the head rotating m a nng foi-med partly of bone, partly of ligament. AU these Hgaments imite to form one general capsule enclosing a single synovial cavity. _ The Anterior Ligament (Fig. '^9, i) is a broad but thin membrane attached to the humerus immediately above the coroiioid and radial fossfe, and below to the coronoid process of the ulna a Kttle below its edge, and to the front of the orbicular bgaineiit.^ The Posterior Ligament is thin and loose, and is attached to the humerus along the sides of the olecranon fossa, as high as the jimction of its upper and middle thirds, at which level it extends across the floor of the fossa; thence it reaches to the external and posterior borders of the olecranon process of the ulna, a short Ois- tancc beliind the articnlar surface. Its strongest fibres usually form a transverse band bridging across the olecranon fossa, it ■nves attachment by its posterior surface to a few fibres of the tri- ceps (mh.aMwnrus),'anA anteriorly is connected with aphca adiposa which fills the olecranon fossa during flexion, but is di-awn upwards by the sub-auconeus in extension.THE ELBOW JOINT. 87 The Internal Lateral Ligament (Fig. 39, 4) is tricangular, the apex being attached to the lower part of the prominent internal condyle, and the base reaching all along the inner margins of the Fig. 39. coronoid and olecranon processes, and bridging across the notch between them. It gives origin to the fibres of the flexor sublimis digitorum. Fig. 40. The External Lateral Ligament (Fig. 40, 3) is a short thick band attached to the lower part of the outer condyle, and radiating to its attachment to the orbicnlar ligament of the radius and Fig, 39.—Ligaments of the elbow from tlie inner side (from Sappey). 1.

It gives origin to fibres of the supinator brevis and extensor cai-pi radialis brevior.^ The Synovial Membrane common to the elbow and superior radio-ubiar joints will be seen by removing the anterior Hgament, and wiU be found to be reflected upon the inner surface of the capsule, including the orbicular Ugament, and upon the bones as far as the margin of the articular cavity. WeU-marked plicae adiposEe are formed by an infolding of the synovial membrane and subsynovial fat opposite the joint furrows and in the positions of the humeral fossee. A very large one fiUs the olecranon fossa duimg flexion, and smaUer ones occupy the coronoid and radial fossae during extension. The articular surfaces of all the bones are encrusted with cartilage, but occasionaUy a groove across the bottom of the greater sigmoid cavity separates that covering the olecranon from that covering the coronoid process; tHs groove, which is seen also in the macerated bone, must not be mistaken for the remains of the epiphysial line. Eelations.—The elbow-joint has in front the brachiabs anticus and biceps, the inner border of the supinator lougus, with the musculo-spii-al nerve and the tei-mination of the superior pro- funda artery beneath it, the pronator teres, the brachial vessels, and the median nerve; Mvind, the triceps and anconeus muscles, io the inner side, the muscles arising from the internal condyle, and the ulnar nerve, with the inferior profunda artery, Ipng upon the internal lateral ligament after passing behind the internal condyle. Externally, the muscles arising from the external condyle and supra- condyloid ridge, and the supinator brevis, which is closely connected with the external lateral ligament. Movements.—The fore-arm is flexed by the biceps, bracliialis anticus, supinator longus, extensor carpi radialis longior, pronator radii teres, and (feebly) by the flexor carpi radiaHs, palmans longus and flexor digitorum sublimis. It is extended by the ti-iceps and anconeus, and slightly by the extensor carpi ulnaris extensor digitorum communis and extensor minimi digiti. matwn of the radius upon the ulna and hiunerus, and consequcntlj- a portion of the movements of pronation and supination of the hand, are pro- duced as follows,-iVo«««/o«, by the pronator quadratus, pronator teres and flexor carpi radialis, supination by the biceps supinator brevis, extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis (ulnar head) and extensor secimdi internodii p.,Uicis. The supinator longus has no influence of importance upon pronation and supination, but probably acts slightly in bringing thcforc-arm into the position of semi-pronation when the elbow is flexed.89 RA 1)10-Ur.NAn ARTICULATIONS. The rotation of the radius iiroimd the ulna iu pronation and supination is associated during life with a Idnd of circumduction of the uhia, effected by movements of flexion, extension, abduc- tion, and adduction, which are almost imperceptible at the elbow- joint, but are easilj^ seen at the wrist. They cannot, however, be demonstrated by passive rotation of the radius in the dead subject. It must be recollected that the entire movement of hand rotation is equal to 280°, and that not more than 120° of this is effected at the radio-ulnar articulations. The rest is accomplished chiefly at the shoulder-joint (about 100°), the carjml joints, and, in exaggerated action, even by the movement of the scapular arch and spinal column. During full extension of the elbow only the anterior border of the upper sm-face of the radius rests against the capitellum of the humerus. The movements of flexion and extension of the elbow take place aroimd an axis passing through the lower end of the humerus from condyle to condyle, but with a slight inclination downwards at its inner extremity. As a result of this obliquitj^, the hand lies in a plane internal to that of the head of the humerus when the fore- arm is fully flexed upon the upper arm, and during complete extension the arm and fore-arm join at a very obtuse angle, the opening of which is directed outwards. The total range of flexion and extension is about 150°. Eadio-Ulnar Articulations. Superior (Fig. 40, 2).—This is a part of the elbow joint. Its only ligament is the Orbicular (Fig. 41, 3), a strong flat band of fibres encircling the head and neck of radius, and attached to the extremities of the lesser sigmoid cavity and slightly into the nock of the radius. It blends with the external lateral ligament of the elbow, and gives oiigin to fibres of the supinator brevis ; the joint cavity is continuous with that of the elbow. Inferior (Fig. 42, 3).—The bones are connected below by iiiitirior and poderior ligaments, short fibrous biinds passing bctwoen the borders of the siguujid cavity of the radius and the head of tho ulna internal to the articular surface; and by an itilcv-arliriilar fihro-rartihir/c which will bo seen when the joint is o]H>n (Fig. 43, 12).

It is attached to the sharp interosseous borders of both bones, a space beuig left above, between it and the oblique ligament, for the passage of the posteiioi interosseous vessels. The membrane is pierced below by the anterior interosseous artery, and one or two of its branches (Fio-. 42, 4). The Oblique lu/ammit (Fig. 40, 6) is an inconstant band, runnmg from the outer side of the tuberosity of the uhia to the radius below the bicipital tubercle. Its direction is there- fore the reverse of that of the principal fibres of the interosseous membrane. The Wrist Joint. The term "wrist joint" is somewhat loosely applied by anatomists, and may be taken to signify either the radio-carpal joint or the whole of the articulations into the foi-mation of which the carijal bones enter. j n a The Radio-Carpal Joint is a modifaed ginglymus admitting of flexion and exten- sion with some lateral and rotatory move- ments, and has anterior, posterior, and two lateral ligaments. The Anterior and Posterior Ligaments (Fi<. 42, 7) are broad bands attached above to the front and back if the lower end of the radius, and below to the front an^^^^^^^^ « the first row of carpal bones, blending with the hgament. the carpus. ■ . s • xr^pi.

Behind, the tendons of the extensor carpi radiaHs longior and the brevier, extensor secundi internodii poUicis, extensor communis digitorum, extensor indicis, extensor minimi digiti, and extensor carpi ulnaris ; with the radial nerve, the dorsal branch of the ulnar nerve, and the tei-mmal branch of the posterior interosseous nerve, as weU as some small The ligaments connecting together the carpal bones are very numerous and scarcely repay a special dissection. They may be classified as follows :— 1. Ligaments of the upper row : Dorsal, Palmar, and Interosseous, running between semi- lunar and bones on either side ; Capsular, between pisifonn and cuneiform ; Transverse, between scaphoid and cuneiform, passing across back of head of os magniun. 2. Ligaments of the lower row : Dorsal, Palmar, and Interosseous, connecting each bone with its neighbours. 3. Ligaments connecting the two rows with each other: Dorsal and Palmar. External Lateral between scaphoid and trapezium. Internal Lateral between cuneiform and uncifoi-m. The Medio-carpal Joint between the two rows of carpal bones is one of great importance, as the movements of flexion and exten- sion of the hand are shared almost equally between this and the radio-carpal articulations. _ , i. n MOVEMEKTS OP Haxd AT WEIST.-Tho hand IS Jlcrol at the radio-carpal and medio-carpal joints by the flexor carpi i-uiuihs, the flexor carpi ulnaris. and the superficial and deep flexors ot the fingers and thiunb. It is extended at the same articulations by Uie two radial carpal extensors, the extensor carpi ulnaris, the eonunon and sp.>cial extensors of the fingers, and the three special extensors of the thumb; the range of motion being greatest when the lingers are flexed. It is obduded at the radio-carpal joint only by tlio thumb extensors, the flexor carpi radiahs, and the extensor carpi radiaHs longior; and is uddaded hy the flexor and extensor carpi uhiaris The rotatory movements associated with pronation anaTHE WRIST JOIXT. 93 supination are effected by those of the pronators and supinators which are attached to the hand. The Superior Metacarpal Ligaments (Fig. 42, i6).—The 2nd, 3rd, and 4th metacarpal bones are connected with the lower row of the carpus by dorsal, jialmar and interosseous ligaments, and hj two ligaments rutming from the pisiform and annular process of the unciform (piso and hamo-metacarpal) to the oth metacarpal bone. The same metacarpal bones are joined together by transverse dorsal, palmar, and interosseous ligaments. The first metacariDal bone has a separate capsular ligament connecting it with the trapezium, this joint allowing double angular movement with slight rotation. The joint between the fifth metacarpal bone and the unciform permits similar angular movements, but much more limited in range. The remaining carpo-metacarpal joints are capable only of a slight gliding or arthrodial movement. [The sjmovial membranes of the wrist are to be opened by the following incisions on the dorsal aspect of the hand: one between the lower ends of the radius and ulna (care being taken not to divide the fibro-cartilage), and three transverse incisions carried between the lower end of the radius and the carjDus, the two rows of carpal bones, and the carpus and metacarpus respectively. The articulations of the pisiform bone and of the first metacarpal bone are also to be opened.] The Synovial Cavities of the Wrist (Kg. 43) are five in number. (1) between the radius and the imder sm-face of the triangular fibro-cartilage above, and the thi-ee outer bones of the first row of the carpus below; (2) between the first and second rows of carpal bones, passing between the several bones as well, also between the second and third metacarpal bones and the opposed carjial bones. It is sometimes sub- divided into two by an interosseous ligament at the articulation between the scaphoid and trapezoid; (3) between the cuneiform and pisiform bones; (4) between the trapezium and the meta- carpal bone of the thumb; (5) between the unciform a)id two inner metacarpal bones, occasionally continuous with tlic 27id. The synovial cavity between the lower ends of the radius and ulna lies above the wrist, and hence ^should not be included in the (jnunioration. The Triangular Fibro-cartilage (Fig. 44, 3) is best seen after removing the carpus altogether. It is a powerful hgamontous structure, occiiKionally perforate, and is attached by its base to the margin of the radius, bntwoen the ulnar and carpal stirfaccs, and94 THH WRIST JOINT. Fig. 44. by its apex to a depression close to the root of the styloid process of the ulna. It is in relation below with the cuneiform and a portion of the semilunar bones. The Inferior Metacarpal Ligaments.—The distal ends ot th.- foui- inner metacarpal bones are joined together by palmar and dorsal transverse ligaments. The palmar transverse Hgament is of great strength and blends with the metacarpo-phalangeal bga- ments The dorsal transverse Ugament is much weaker, and is separated from the former by a space which transmits the tendons of the interossei. The Metacarpus and Phalanges are connected mainly by two lateral ligaments, but anterior and posterior ligaments are sometimes recognised. The Anterior ligament is represented by strong fibro-cartilaginous glenoid plates passing fi-om the anterior border of the base of the phalanx, to be loosely attached to the metacarpal bone just above the head, and closely connected with the pabnar transverse metacarpal ligament and lateral Ugaments ; it assists m forming the sheath of the tendons. The Posterior ligament consists merely of a few dehcate tibres strengthening the sjmovial membrane beneath the expansion of the extensor tendons. ^. -u i i The Lateral ligaments are sti-ong bands which are attached above to the sides of the heads of the metacarpal bones, and, spreading out in a fan-like manner, pass obHquely to the anterior and lateral margins of the phalanges, decussating with each other in fi-ont ot the joint and blending with the glenoid plate. The strength of the radial Hgament is greater than that of the ulnar, and is reinforced by the lumbricalis. ■. f Each joint is provided with a synovial membrane which forms a circular fold (plica adiposa) between the two bones at the level ot the articular fissure. The articulation is cnarthrocbal. and its movements are flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, and Fig. 44.- -Lower end of radius and ulna with triangular fibro-cartilage (from Wilson). 1.

Tlie latter motion occm-s only dui-ing circum- duction. The Phalangeal Articulations are similar to those be- tween the metacarpus and phalanges, but their movements are limited to flexion and extension, and the joints are hence ginglymoid.3 (D rT3 0) o 53 o o III f o Pt 3 a u o i o m o "i 2 Si " »*- ^ • o o 3 s £ tl^ o o p tc d o d g d n S Qj o! 0) - -e d H S 3 s'^.-gl " o o] cS en ^ 3 d c3 n - CJ !3 O 5 5 5. ^3 .ago O U Eh cC CD d o S , m g u ci o .2 S • a. ■5 3 ^ X g ° J H MS ®W ■■S^ c3 d 2 = g O d o Cm !

The positions of the gluteal and sciatic vessels where thej^ escape from the pelvis may be found hy drawing two lines from the posteiior superior iliac spine to the top of the posterior border of the great trochanter and to the tuber ischii respectively. The gluteal artery will be found at the junction of the upper and middle thirds of the first, and the sciatic artery at the junction of the middle and lower thirds of the second. The head of the femur may be felt behind the trochanter when the limb is rotated inwards, and in a very thin subject it may be detected in front when the finger is thrust deeply into Scarpa's triangle. The great sciatic nerve lies midway between the great trochanter and the ischial tuberosity, and to the inner side of the acetabular margin. The position of the hip joint may be defined by drawing down- wards a line an inch long at right angles to the middle of Poupart's ligament. The fi-ee extremity of this liiie corresponds to the head of the femiu' immediately below the middle of the border of the acetabulum. The cundijles of the femur, the adductor tubercle above the inner tuberosity, and the patella are to be examined, and it shordd be noticed how large a part of the articular end of the femur is uncovered by the patella when the knee is flexed, while during extension two-thirds of the articular sui-face of the patella is above the femoral trochlea. The lifjamentum patelke and its attachment to the tibia are to be noticed, and the finger should be carried along the subcutaneous surface of the tibia, down to the ankle. The hva-l of the fibula is readily felt behind and below the outer tuber- osity of the tibia. The hand canied to the back of the joint will recognise the outer and inner hamstrings attached to the fibula and to the tibia, and when the knee is flexed may sink into the popUteal space behind the joint. The external popliteal iierre lies on the umer side of the biceps tendon and then passes behind the head of the fibula to wind around the neck, where it bifurcates. The lower fourth of the fibula is subcutaneous and terminates in the prominent external malleolus, behind which the perone((l tendons can bo felt. On the inner side, the inner malleolus lies anterior to and higher up than the outer; and behind its border will be felt the large tendon of the tibialis posticus, external to which is the tendon of the flcror liingus digit„runi.

The tendo Achrllis maj' be traced to the os calcii?. Its naiTOwest portion is a little above the bone. In the foot, the following points of practical utility should be thoroughly recognised. Firstly, on the inner side, but not easily to be felt in "the normal state, is the head of the astrufjalus, about a finger's breadth below the anterior border of the malleolus; in front of this is the prominence of the tuberosity of the scapJioi'l bone, to which the tendon of the tibialis posticiis may be traced; and more anteriorly lies the slighter prominence of the interna! cuneiform bone, with the base of the first metatarsal bone in front of it, and the tendon of the tibialis anticus attached to both bones. Secondly, on the outer side, the tendons of the peronei crossing the calcaneum, and farther forwards the prominent base of the fifth metatarsal hone. The Front of the Thigh. [An incision is to be made along Poupart's ligament, and carried down the inner border of the thigh for half its length, and this is to be ioined by another across the limb at that point ; the iiap ol skin thus marked out is to be carefully reflected to the outer side of the thigh. The superficial fascia is to be first examined.] The Superficial fascia of the thigh is continuous %vith the super- ficial fascia of the abdomen over Pouparfs ligament, and generally contains a good deal of fat, particularly in the female subject it is divisible into two layers in the upper part of the thigh, and the deep laver will be seen by reflecting the superficial layer m the same way as the skin, but not so far down, the separation between the two layers of fascia being marked by some small vessels, glands, and minute nerves. , , „ ^i.

The Superficial lymphatic glands will also be found between the layers of superficial fascia, and are arranged in two rows, one extending obliquely along the groin, and receiving the lymphatics ol tbe penis, scrotum, perineeum, anal region, nates, and abdommal wall below the umbilicus; and another running down veiticaUy below the groin and draining the superficial lymphatics of the limb. A few Deeper lymphatic glands wiU be afterwards met with sui-- rounding tbe femoral vessels. These di-ain the deep structures of the lower extremity. Tbe Superficial Nerves are tbe terminations of the itio-nigumal, crnraJ branch of the yenito-crural, and external cutaneous, bom the lumbar plexus ; and tbe middle and internal cutaneous branches of the anterior crural. Their distribution wiU be given later. The Deep layer of superficial fascia is more membranous than the superficial layer, and will be best seen by raising it from the deep fascia beneath, beginning about four inches below the gi-om and reflecting it on to Poupart's ligament. This layer of superficial fascia will be found to be bound down to the fascia lata below Poupart's ligament, and around the margin of the opening tbrough wbich the saphenous vein disappears, caUed the Saphenous opening. Unlike the superficial layer it does not pass over Poupart's hga- ment, and therefore has some influence in dii'ecting a large femoral hernia along the groin. It receives the name of Cribriform fascia at the part where it crosses the saphenous opening, because it is perfor- ated by numerous small apertm-es for the passage of vessels and lymph.;tics. Great care must be taken not to destroy the ■ saphenous opening in removing the deep layer of the superficial fascia. . i i • The Deev fascia of-the thigh (fascia lata) is now exposed, and i>, to be cleaned as far as is necessary for the study of the part, concerned in femoral hernia, the several nerves piercing it being left tor sub- sequent examination.

It is an oval cleft nearly half an inch wide, without any distinct limitation internally, but sharply bounded on the outer side and below by^ the semicircular border {falciform marc/in) of a j^rocess of fascia {jirocess of Burns), which passes fi'om the fascia lata of the fi'ont of the thigh to become attached to the whole length of Poupart's Hgament. The falciform margin which partly encircles the long saphenoiis vein has a well defined curve like that of a French horn. It crosses in front of the femoral sheath to join the inner part of Poupart's ligament at a variable point, while internally and below it passes imperceptibly into the pubic portion of the fascia lata which covers the pectineus muscle. The pectineal fascia passes behind the femoral sheath to be attached to the ilio-pectineal line above, and to become continuous with the ilio-psoas fascia ex- ternally. The saj^henoirs opening is the external apertm-e through which a femoral hernia passes, and might therefore well be called the external femoral ring, although strictly speaking there is in the undissected condition no definite ring, but merely a weak point in the fascia through which the hernia proti-udes, pushing before it the cribrifoi-m fascia. The edges of the saphenous opening will be fomid to be relaxed when the thigh is flexed and adducted, the position in which the limb is placed when the "taxis" is applied for the reduction of a hernia. [An incision is to be made from the lower end of the saphenous opening transversely outwards for two inches, and a corresjjonding one immediately below Poupart's ligament, and the piece of fascia thus marked out and including the falciform process is to be reflected to the outer side.] Gimbernat's ligament (Fig. 50, ii) consists of a strong baud of fibres passing from the innermost portion of Poupart's ligament to Fig. ill.—Superficial dissection of the groin (from Maclise's Surgical Anatomy).

It fills the angl between Ponpart's ligament and the pubic bone, and presents a free edge turned outward,-; towards the femoral sheath. Behind it lies the conjoined tendon, the fascia transversalis, a small anastomotic arch between the pubic branches of the deep epigastric and obtm-ator vessels, and more deeply the subperitoneal tissue and peritoneum. The name Liyamerd of Cooper is given to a fibrous band which runs along the ilio-pectineal line from the nio-pectineal eminence to the pubic spine. The Sheath of the Common Femoral Vessels (Figs. 47, 48, E) lies between the process of fascia lata (process of Burns) passing to Poupart's ligament in front, and the pectineal and iliac fascire behind. This sheath appears as a tube, broader above than below, and composed of a delicate connective tissue, containing more or less fat. It invests the femoral artery, vein, and a portion of the deep lymphatics, and may be traced beneath Poupart's ligament upon the external iliac vessels, where it is continuous with the subperitoneal fascia which ensheaths the latter, while below it may be followed as a vascular sheath throughout the limb; it is pierced externally by the crural branch of the genito-crm-al nerve. It is usually stated to be fomied by the union of the fascia transversalis and fascia iliaca aromid the vessels, but it is essentially a prolonga- tion of the subperitoneal tissue sheath of the iliac vessels, reinforced by some fibres from the fascia transversalis in front, and is separated from the iliac fascia behind by loose connective tissue. Three vertical incisions, one in the centre and one at each side of the tubular sheath, wiU enable the dissector to see that it is divided by two slender septa into three compartments, the femoral artery occupying the outermost, the femoral vein the middle, and Figs. 47 and 48.—The tmatomy of the groin (from IMaclise's Surgical Anatomy).

This last division of the femoral sheath is the femoral or criifdl faiHiL The Femoral or Crural Ring (Fig. 50, 12).—If the finger be passed upwards along the cruial canal, it will enter the Crural or Femoral Riiuj beneath Poui^art's ligament, displacing a lymphatic gland and a small piece of subi^eritoneal fat which occupy it, the latter forming the septum crurale. The boundaries of the crural ring can be better felt than seen, and are, in/rout, Poupai't's ligament, with occasionally a distinct band of fascia traiisversalis beneath it, called the deep crural arch; heJiind, the body of the pubes, with the pectineus muscle and jmbic portion of the fascia lata; extenialli/, the femoral vein ; and internally-, the sharji margin of Gimbernat's ligament. The crural ring is the aperture through which a femoral hernia leaves the abdomen, and the point at which strangulation most commonly occurs; the finger should therefore thoroughly explore it. (Fig. 49, E.) The Crural or Femoral Canal (Figs. 47, 48) is the canal, half an inch in length, along which femoral hernia descends from the crural ring to the saphenous opening; but as soon as the hernia has forced its way through that spot, it ascends, owing to the close attachment of the cribriform fascia to the margin of the saphenous opening, and lies along Poupart's ligament, or if of large size, may stretch the fascia sufficiently to mount over the ligament and simulate an inguinal hernia. The Coverings of a Femoral Hernia will be readily learned if the course it takes has been thoroughly understood. In its descent the intestine pushes before it (1) peritoneal sac, (2) subperitoneal fat, (3) femoral sheath, (4) cribriform fascia, (5) super- ficial fascia and skin. It must not be supposed that the surgeon will recognise these various coverings in operating upon a strangu- lated femoral hernia, but it is necessary that he should identify the sac or peritoneuin, which is usually to be recognised liy its thin bluish appearance, and by the fluid goneiully to be seen through its slightly ti-ansparent wall.

The fascia covers the whole of the liiiib, sending septal processes between the muscles and to the b(jny ridges fi-om which they arise. In the middle and lower portion of the thigh the fascia lata sends inwards two strong intermuscular septa, an external dividing the vastus externus from the hamstrings, and an internal between the vastus internus and the adductors, both giving attachment extensively to muscular fibres (Fig. 51). The portion of the fascia lata on the outer side of the thigh is of remarkable strength; it receives above the insertions of the tensor vaginae femoris and the upper half of the gluteus maximus (both of which it encloses before reaching its attachment to the os innominatum), and runs down- wards to be attached to the outer border of the pateUa below the vastus externus, to the ligamentum pateUse and to the outer ttiberosity of the tibia. It is souaetimes called the ilio-tihial hand. The hamstrings are bound down by a layer of fascia within the fascia lata, and in addition a third and still deeper investment can be demonstrated as a sheath for each of the muscles (semi-membrano- sus, semi-tendinosus and biceps) (Fig. 51). Cutaneous nerves (Eig. 52).—The lUo-inguinal nerve, which emerges from the external abdominal ring, in its coui-se to the scrotiun or labium gives one or two small branches to the thigh. The Crural hrauch of the Genitu-cruraJ nerve pierces the fascia half an inch below Poupart's ligament and just outside the femoral artery, and joins the middle cutaneous nerve. It is very seldom satisfactorily seen unless traced from the lumbar plexus. The External cutaneous nerve (3) is to be foimd amongst some fat in a fold of fascia lata close to the anterior superior spiiie of the iHum, and pierces the fascia at a variable point, to be distributed by an anterior and a posterior branch to the outer side of the thigh and part of the buttock. The 3mdle cutaneous nerve (5) (fi-om the anterior crural), pierces the fascia in the upper third of the thigh, usually in two places, and will be afterwards traced as far as the knee. This nerve, or its outer branch, usually pierces the sartorius, which muscle it generally sup])lies. The Internal cutaneous and Lon;] Saphenous nerves are not seen at present. Scarpa's TurAXOLK.

The base of the triangle is formed by Poupart's ligament; the outer border by the inner edge of the sartorius muscle ; the vmer border by the outer margin of the adductor longus ; and the apex by the meeting of these muscles. The space is covered in by the skin and superficial fascia and Burns's process of the fascia lata, and its floor will now be seen to be formed by the jDsoas and iliacus on the outer side; the pectineus and, in some sub- jects, a small portion of the adductor brevis on the inner side: these muscles all being- covered by their fascise.

The saphenous vein is not one of the contents of the space, until it has pierced the fascia lata to end in the common femoral vein. The Femoral Artery in Scarpa's Triangle (Pig. o2, 4).—ihe femoral artery (under which term is included the common femoral trunk and its superficial femoral branch) is the continuation of the external iliac artery, and extends fi-om Poupart's hgament to the opening in the adductor magnus, through which it passes to the popliteal space. The part now exposed is that above the point crossed by the sartorius, and is usuaUy over a thu-d of the whole len-th of the vessel. When the thigh is slightly flexed and abducted, the artery runs fi-om a point midway between the sym- iDhvsis pubis and the anterior superior iliac spme (or about a thu-d of an inch to the inner side of the centre of Poupari s hgament) throuo-h the middle of the triangle in a Kne with the prominent adductor tubercle on the inner condyle of the femur ; but when the thigh is fully extended it wiU be seen to wind slightly to the inner side of the limb. This portion of the artery, lying within its sheath, is covered by the superficial fascia and the fascia of Burns, and one or two branches of the internal cutaneous nerve cross the vessel at variable points. Behind the artery from above downwards are, the psoas - the nerve to the pectineus; the pectineus itself, separated from he femoral artery by the profunda artery and vem and the femoral vein; and occasionaUy, between the pec mens and he adductor longus, a small portion of the adductor brevis. To the ol- side throughout is the anterior criu-al nerve usually sepai-ated a the upper part by a small interspace; and the long saphenous branch and the nerve to the vastus internus ai. m c ose relataon with it at the lower part of the space (Fig. o ., 19), the lattei ! nl in fhP former The femoral vein is to the wmr side neai ?ou;:i lita-^^^^^ lo-r down passes ,eMn, the ai^ry, and forms one of its posterior relations at the apex of the ti-iangle.

The largest branch, (5) the profunda avtevj, arises from one to two inches or more below Poupart's ligament and is now seen lying first to the outer side of, and then behind, the femoral artery and vem, and resting iii^on the iliacus and pectineus. Should, however, the external circumflex arise fi-om the common femoral instead of fi-om the profunda, the commencement of the latter vessel lies behind or even to the inner side of the superficial femoral. The profunda is the great artery to the muscles of the thigh, and will be afterwards dissected. The Femoral Vein at the lower part of Scarpa's triangle lies behind and sometimes a little to the outer side of the artery. It then crosses obliquely beHnd it, and after being joined by the profunda vem, reaches the inner side of the common femoral artery at the upper part of the space; and there it receives the saphenous vein, which has previously been joined by the veins con-esponding to the small branches of the artery (superficial epigastric, circmnflex iliac and external pudic). At the apex of the triangle it is very closely connected with the artery. The Anterior Crural Nerve (Pig. 57, 5) is derived from the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th nerves of the lumbar plexus, and enters Scarpa's triangle beneath Poupart's Kgament, resting upon the adjacent borders of the psoas and iliacus muscles. It breaks up into super- facial and deep divisions, which are separated by the external cir- cumflex vessels, the sirj.er/idal giving off the midcUe and internal cutaneous nerves and supplying the sartorius and the pectineiis; the deep supplymg muscular branches to the rectus femoris, crureus, vastus mternus and vastus exteriius, and the long or internal saphenous nerve, which becomes cutaneous at the inner side of the knee.

Piercing the fascia at several points are the cutaneous nerves of the thigh, some of which have been ah-eady seen, but the foUowmg are now to be traced to theh- distributions and then to theu- origins, the fascia being removed as maybe necessary for the latter pm-pose. The Internal cutaneous nerve (Eig. 52, 7, ») is a branch of the anterior crui'al; it gives two or thi-ee small twigs to the uM^er and inner parts of the thigh, and crosses the femoral artery m Scarpa s triangle. Either before or after doing so it divides into two branches, anterior and posterior. The auteri<>r branch becomes cutaneous in the lower third of the thigh, the filaments reaching as far as the patellar plexus; the posterior branch appears close to the saphenous vein a little above the knee, and its branches unite with those of the other branch, with the internal saphenous neiwe and occSonaUy with a superBcial branch of the obtui-ator, and are distributed over and a little below the inner side oi the^-^e^^^^^ The Long or Mernal Saphenous ncrre (Fig. o2, 16 "^^^^^^ «f which wiU be afterwards seen) becomes cutaneous at he mnei side Tf the knee ioint, where it lies at first in fi-ont of the saphenous veif Be or becoming cutaneous it sends a large bi-anch forward to L si n of the patella {ramus cntaneus patellce (14) winch piei-ces the sLtius, andUes with branches of f V^^Tirharbee cutaneous and external popUteal nerves to form what has been called the plexus yatdlw. ^,,.;«V,1p but thev The Siierfidal Veins of the thigh are very vauable, but they either open into the saphenous vein separately or oi-m one or mte seplte branches which join the main trunk at or near the saphenous opening.

The muscle, as its name implies, is a tensor of the fascia of the thigh, and thereby supports and assists the other muscles of the limb, especially the gluteus maximus, by fixing theii- fascial attachments; it is also an abductor and internal rotator of the femur, and acts upon the trunk when the thigh is fixed. It is supplied by a branch of the superior gluteal nerve, which may be seen entering the deep sui-face of the muscle when it is reflected. The Sartorius (Fig. 53, 5) is the longest muscle of the body, and when dissected lies loosely upon the subjacent muscles. It arises from the anterior superior spine of the ilium, from the notch below it, and fi-om the outermost portion of Poupart's ligament; and crossing obliquely over the thigh, winds behind the inner condyle of the femur and forwards below the inner tuber- osity of the tibia, to be inserted into the subcutaneous sui-face below the junction of the head of the bone with the shaft, by a broad tendinous expan- sion, which is ijicorporated with the fascia of the limb and overlaps the insertion of the gi'acilis and semi- tendinosus muscles, a bursa intervening between them.

It is supplied by the middle cutaneous branch of the anterior crui'al nerve, and pierced by the middle and internal cutaneous nerves and by the patellar branch of the long saphenous. The Sub-Sartorial Plexus is situated beneath the sartorius, and on the roof of Hiuiter's canal. It is a plexifoim intercom- munication between the internal saphenous, the internal cutaneous, and the superficial division of the obturator nerve. The auadriceps Extensor is the fleshy mass on the front of the thigh, consisting of the rectus femoris superficiaUy, with the crui-eus beneath it, and the vastus externus and intemus on either .side. The Bectus Femoris (Fig. 53, 6) has no attachment to the femur, but stretches over it from the pelvis to the pateUa. It arises by two tendons, one from the anterior inferior spuie of the iliiun, the other from a rough impression above the acetabulum. The outer or reflected tendon may be easily exposed by separatmg the tensor vagince femoris and rectus, and clearing away the fat and connective tissue from the deep interspace with the handle ot the scalpel. The two heads unite to form a bipennifoi-m muscle, which is tendinous on its upper sm-face above and on its under sm-face at the" lower part, and passes to be attached to the upper border and anterior surface of the pateUa in conjunction with the other extensor muscles, the strong fibres which pass m front of the pateUa forming the superficial portion of the Hgamentum patelte and reaching the tubercle of the tibia, the ti-ue insertion of the quadri- ceps. The crureus joins the back of the tendon above the pateUa, and the vasti are attached to its borders. It will be noticed that the straight head is in the axial hue of the muscle during extension of the thigh, the reflected head during right angle flexion. _ . Beneath the rectus wiU be seen the External arcumflex branch of the profunda artery (Fig. 54, ii). This arises fi-om the outer side of the vessel near its origin, and runs transversely between the branches of the anterior crural nerve, upon the vastus externum and beneath the sartorius and rectus femoris, to the outer side ot the thigh, where it divides into ascending, transverse, and rtescenU- inc. nets of branches. The ascendiny branches pass be.ieath he tensor fasciae to anaston.ose with the gluteal and the deep circumflex iliac arteries, and give twigs to the hip joint; the supply the vastus externus, and, turning round the limb, . na.to- mJse with the perforating branches of the pro unda and assi.t rforining the crucial anastomosis; whilst the descn.dv,y branchTHE QUADRICEPS EXTENSOR. 117 passes into the vastus externus with the nerve to that muscle and ends at the knee-joint, where it anastomoses with the superior external articular branch of the popliteal and the anastomotica magna. The Vastus Externus (Pig. 53, 7) is the largest of the three muscles in front of the femiu-. It arises from the anterior border of the great trochanter as far as the base of the superior tubercle of the neck, from the lower border of the trochanter, the outer part of the gluteal ridge, the upper half of the outer border of the linea aspera, and extensive^ from the external intermuscular septum. Its fibres end in a broad aponeiu'osis, which is inserted into the tendon of the rectus and the upper third of the outer border of the patella, aiding in the formation of the knee capsule. Its upper superficial fibres are commonly detached from the rest by a deep intermuscular space. The Vastus Internus (Fig. 53, 8) is more or less united with the crureus. It arises from the lower half of the spiral line, from the inner side of the linea aspera, from the tendons of the adductor longus and magnus, and from the internal intermuscular septum. It is insn-ted into the upper half of the inner side of the patella and into the rectus tendon. Like the vastus externus it helps to iovm the capsule of the knee joint. The origin of the lower part of the muscle cannot be seen quite distinctly at present, since it is miited with the tendons of the adductor longus and magnus by a sirb-sartorial plane of fascia, which covers in'the femoral vessels in Himter's canal. The Crureus covers the fi-ont of the femur between the two vasti and beneath the rectus. It arises from the upper part of the spiral hne and the anterior and outer surfaces of the femur, to aboiit four mches from the lower end of the bone, as well as from the lower part of the external interaiuscular septum, and is inserted into the patella with the other extensor muscles. Its surface is tendinous to allow free movement of the rectus upon it. Its lowest fibres of ongni_ fonu the snhrrurens, which will be best dissected with the knee joint. The snpra-puiellar pouch is a prolongation upwards of the synovial membrane of the knee-joint for two inches or more above the top of the patella beneath the crureus and vasti, and receives the insertion of the subcrureus. It is often separated from the true joint cavity by an hour-glass constriction, and occasionally by a complete septum Bursa in connection with the quadriceps will be found in ront of the patella, and between the ligamentum patella3 and the upper part of the tubercle of the tibia.HQ THE FRONT OF THE THIGH. Tho Anterior Crural Nerve (Fig. o.. 5) soppUM , . Action—The quadriceps extensor is the great extensor of the leg upon the thigh, and is therefore in constant requisition in walking, but it will he observed that in standing upright the yasti are relaxed, and the patella can be moved freely from side to side. The rectus, in addition, flexes the thigh upon the pelvis; and, when the leg is fixed, flexes the pelvis upon the femur. It is supj,hed by the anterior crvuval nerve. The Femoral Artery in Hunter's Canal (Fig. o4, ig).— Hunter's canal is an intermuscular space beneath the sartonus m the middle third of the thigh, and is continuous with the apex of Scarpa's triangle above, and with the popliteal space below It contains the femoral vessels, the long saphenous nerve, and the nerve to the vastus internus. It is bounded beh ind by the adductors longus and magnus, externaUy by the vastus internus, and w front by a fascial aponeurosis stretching over the vessels fi-om the external to the posterior wall, and by the sartorius.

The saph™ nerve Hes at first to the outer side of the artery but crosses it below to whid around the tendon of the sartorius and become cutaneous on the inner side of the knee. The Opernng in the Adductor Magnus, as it is commonly called is in realty an opening between the round tendon of the adductor magnus on the inner side, and the fibres of the vastus -ternus -d L femur on the outer side.

The branch to the sartorius has been already seen to arise from the middle cutaneous nerve, and the nerve to the pec- tineus, also arising from the superficial division, crosses beneath the femoral vessels to the surface of the pectineus muscle. The deep division supplies branches to each of the constituents of the quad- riceps extensor, the nerve to the rectus giving a branch to the hip joint, and those to the vasti and crureus giving twigs to the knee joint. The Internal Saphenous Nerve (Fig. 57, 22) is the longest brunch of the deep division of the anterior crural nerve. It lies close to the outer side of the femoral artery, and enters Hunter's canal with it; then crossing the artery near the lower end of the canal it pierces the sheath, appearing beneath the sartorius at the inner side of the knee. In the thigh it gives a communicating branch to the subsartorial plexus, and at the knee its patellar branch pierces the sartorius and ends in the patellar plexus. The nerve becomes cutaneous between the sartorius and gracilis, and nuis down the inner side of the leg and foot. Inner Side of the Thigh. [The .supei-ficial muscle of the inner side of the thigh (adductor longus) IS ah-eady partially seen : to expose the rest of the region an incision is to be made along the rami of the pubes and ischium, and the skin is to be reflected, when the gracilis will be brought into view. The femoral vessels must either be cut and turned down, or puUed forcibly outwards.] A few cutaneous branches of nerve to the skin of the inner side of the thigh will be found appearing below the adductor longus. They are derived from the obturator. The Adductor Longus (Fig. 53, 13) arises by a round tendon from the front of the os pubis immediately below the crest, and expands to be inserted into the inner border of the linea aspera, in the middle third of the bone, and into the internal intemiuscular septum, blending with the insertions of the adductors brevis and magnus. It is supplied by the superficial division of the obturator nerve. In the middle third of the thigh it separates the superficial from the deep femoral vessels, the latter disappearing from Scarpa's triangle between the adjacent borders of this muscle and the pectineus. The Gracilis (Fig. 54, 20) is the most internal of the muscles oi the thigh and arises from the rami of the os pubis and ischium Dy a broad tlun tendon about three inches in leugtli. It is inserted]20 INNER SIDE OF THE THIGH. into the inner surface of the tibia under cover of the sartorius and above the semi-tendinosus, a bursa intervening between it and these muscles; it also sends a slip to the fascia of the leg. It is sui-)pHed by the superficial division of the obturator nerve. [The adductor longus is to be divided near its origin and turned down, in order to expose the adductor breyis and the insertions of the pectineus, psoas, and iliacus. The branch of the obturator nerve to the mSscle is to be preserved, and the profunda vessels are to be cleaned as far as exposed.] The Pectineus (Fig. 54, 14) lias been ali-eady seen in relation with the femoral artery and forming part of the floor of Scarpa s triangle.

The adduction if combined with flexion can be Fig. 54. carried beyond the middle line, so as to cross the thigh over the opposite limb. The pectineus is also an adductor, external rotator, and flexor of the thigh ; and the gracilis is an adductor of the thigh, and in addition a flexor and an internal rotator of the knee.

The Profunda Artery (Fig. 54, 16) has been seen to anse from the femoral artery in Scarpa's triangle, from one to two inches below Poupart's ligament; lying at first to the outer side of the femoral artery and against the iUacus, and then winding mwards on to the pectineus behind the femoral vessels and its own veins. It next passes below the border of the pectineus behind the adductor longus, which separates it from the superficial femoral vessels, and on to the adductor brevis andmagnus, ending by piercing the latter. The profunda vein is superficial to its artery in the whole of its coui-se The Branches of the Profunda are the external and internal cii'cumflex, three perforating arteries, and a terminal branch, besides branches to the muscles on the inside of the thigh. 1 The External Circumflex artery (11) arises from the outer side of the prof^mda near its origin, and has been ah-eady seen m the dissection of the thigh (p. 116). When this vessel as is not mire- quently the case, springs from the common femoral, the uppei par of the profunda is no longer external to the superficial femoial, but lies behind or internal to it. . • ^ +1,^ 9 The Internal Circumflex artery (Figs. 55, 56) anses from the inner side of the profunda near its origin, and passmg backwards between the psoas and the pectineus, reaches the obturator externus muscle above the adductor brevis, where it divides mto two tei-minal branches. It supplies twigs to the muscles on the inner side of the thigh, an anastomotic branch to the obtm-ator ari^'iT, ^u articular branch to the hip-joint. Of the '^'^1^^}'^^^'''^^^^ foUows the tendon of the obturator externus to the digital ios^a ot the great trochanter, supplying the external rotator muscles and anastomosing with the gluteal, sciatic and first perforating artenes: the other passes to the back of the tHgh between the quadi-atus femoris and the adductor magnus, and supplies the vipper par ot the hamstrings, anastomosing with the sciatic and tirst perfoiatm^ arteries, and occasionally with the external circumflex.

The obturator artery is best seen after the removal of the thigh from the pelvis, in the dissection of which its description is included. The Bctttock. [The body being tiu'ned on its face, the buttocks are to be raised by blocks beneath the pelvis until the thigh can be well flexed with the knee on the table, or, if preferred, the legs may be allowed to hang over the end of the table.] The dissector should recognise the crest of the ilium, which will boimd his dissection superiorly, also the sacrum and coccyx, and the tuberosity of the ischiimi. The latter can be felt through the gluteus maximus in the extended position of the limb, or immediately beneath the integmnent when the hip-joint is flexed. The relations of the trochanter to the several parts of the pelvis in the different positions of the limb are of gi-eat practical importance in the diagnosis of fractures and dislocations, and should be carefully examined. The "fold of the buttock" varies according to the amount of fat and the muscular development of the subject. It should be noticed that it does not coincide in dii-ection with the oblique lower border of the gluteus maximus, but when the limb is extended runs almost horizontally outwards, crossing the muscle near its middle. The prominences of the inner and outer hamstrings and the hollow of the ham will be seen during flexion, and it should be noted how readily the space can be explored in this position owing to the relaxation of the fascia. [An incision is to be made along the crest of the ilium and down the middle of the sacrum to the tip of the coccyx, when, if the perinajum and thigh have been dissected, it wiU only be necessary to make another cut across the upper part of the back of the thigh, following the fold of the buttock obliquely downwards and outwards,' to aUow the large flap of skin to be reflected outwards.] The amount of fat beneath the skin of the buttock varies con- siderably, and if there is a large quantity it is not advisable to spend time in looking for cutaneous nerves. The Cutaneous Nerves are descending and ascending. The desrmding branches will be found passing over the middle of the crest of the ilium, and are the iliac branches of the last dorsal and ilio-hypogastric neiwes, the former being in front of the latter. The posterior divisions of the upper three lumbar nerves pierce the ongm of the erector spineo and supply cutaneous branches over128 THE BUTTOCK. the inner aspect of tlie gluteus maximus, and by the side of the coccyx appear two small branches derived fi-oia the posteiior branches of the upper three sacral nerves. The ascending branches are derived from the lesser sciatic nerve and the perforating cutaneous branch of the sacral plexus, and tm-n round the lower border of the gluteus maximus, to supply the integument over the lower part of the buttock. [The portion of deep fascia covering the gluteus medius and seen in front of the gluteus maximus is to be cleaned, and then the gluteus maxhuus itseU, the fibres being put on the stretch by flexing and inverting the thigh, and the dissector beginning at the upper border of the muscle on the right, and its lower border on the left limb.] The Gluteus Maximus (Fig. 59, 2) arises from the rough triangle between the posterior thii'd of the crest of the ilium and the superior curved line on the dorsum ilii; fi'om the aponeiu'osis of the erector spinis, fi'om the lower part of the sacrum, and the side of the first thi'ee pieces of the coccyx; from the fascia coveiing the gliiteus medius, and by deep fibres from the posteiior surface of the great sacro-sciatic ligament, which wiU be seen when the muscle is diyided. The fibres run downwards and outwards, and the upper half of the muscle is inserted into the fascia lata (ilio- tibial band), the lower half being also atta.ched superficiaUy to the fascia, but deeply to the rough gluteal ridge leading fi-om the back of the trochanter major to the linea aspera of the femui-. The o-luteus maximus is one of the most important muscles of the lower extremity. Acting from the pelvis it is a powerful extensor and external rotator of the thigh, and a tensor of the fascia lata, and its lower fibres aid in adduction. Acting fi'om the feimu- it extends and rotates the trunk. It is siqiplied by the inferior gluteal nerve, a branch of the sacrfil plexus or of the small sciatic nerve. TThe oluteus is to be divided near its origin and turned down, when its attachment to the sacro-sciatic ligament above and the fascia below will be better seen. Some bmnches ot the glut«^^l artery at the upper, and of the sciatic at the lower part of the mulde must necessarily be divided, but the nerves going to its under surface from the small sciatic shoidd be preserved if possible.] Throe bursLV will be found in connection with the gluteus maxi- mus • one between the upper part of its tendon and the great ti'ochauter; a second between the tendon and the vastus externus;129 THE GLUTEUS MEDIUS. Fig. 59. and a third over the tuberosity of the ischivim. The hitter is sub- cutaneous when the thigh is flexed, but is covered by the muscle diuing extension. The Parts beneath, the Gluteus Maximus (Figs. 60, 61) can now be seen, covered by loose cellular tissue, which is to be re- moved. They are from above downwards:—1, gluteus medius; 2, superficial branches of the gluteal vessels; 3, pyriformis muscle ; 4, sciatic vessels and nerves (great and small) and inferior gluteal nerve; 5, jDudic vessels and nerve, and nerve to obtui'ator inter- nus; 6, tendon of the obturator internus with the gemeUi muscles above and below it; 7, the tendon of the obtm-ator exter- nus, usually concealed by the inferior gemellus and quadratus ; 8, quadratus femoris and upper border of adductor magnus; 9, great sacro-sciatic ligament; 10, tuber ischii and muscles attached to it; 11, terminal branches of internal circiun- flex vessels, ajipearing above and below the quadratus femoris; 12, the upper end of the femur with the vastus externus. [These structures are to be cleaned as far as possible at once, and will be examined in succession. In order to clean the muscles, the thigh must be well rotated mwards, and for the gluteus medius it must be crossed beneath the opposite limb. Care should be taken to preserve an an_astomo.sis of arteries between the tuber ischii and great trochanter.] The Gluteus Medius (Fig. 59, i) avMes from an area upon the dorsum ilii bounded by the superior and middle curved lines and the anterior fom--fifths of the external Pig. 59.-MuHcleB of the posterior femoral and gluteal region (fro„> Wil.on) 1.

The inferior branch (6) crosses the gluteus minimus to the great trochanter, to supply the parts iu its neighbom-hood, and ends in the tensor vagiute femoris, anastomosing with the external circumflex and sciatic arteries. Vence comites accompany the branches of the artery and open into the internal iliac vein. The branches of the deep division are accompanied by those of the superior gluteal nerve. The Sciatic Artery (Fig. 61, 13) is a branch of the anterior division of the internal iliac artery, and emerges from the pelvis through the great sacro-sciatic foramen below the pyriformis, where its position is incUcated by a point at the junction of the middle and lower thirds of a line running fi-om the posterior superior ihac spine to the ischial tuberosity. It gives large inferior gluteal branches to the gluteus maximus, and muscular branches to the other smaller muscles of the neighboiu-hood, accompanying their respective nerves ; and anastomoses with both the external and in- ternal cii-cumflex arteries of the profunda femoris. Its named branches are, 1, the cocci/rjeal (15), which pierces the great sacro- sciatic ligament to supply the parts about the coccyx ; 2, the comes nervr uchiadici (28), which runs upon the great sciatic nerve and into Its terminal branches, and appears to be the direct continuation o± the mam trunk ; and 3, the anastomotic branch (16), which passes to the root of the great trochanter to anastomose with the gluteal and internal circumflex arteries, and sometimes with the external circumflex, m the so-caUed crucial anastomosis.

The dissection of the popliteal space should be made ^^efore tlie skS^on the back of the upper part of the thigh is reano^^d, so that the relations of the parts in the ham may be undisturbed.137 THE POPLITEAL SPACE. [A vertical incision is to be made in the middle line of the limb at the back of the knee, extending for six inches above and the same fhstance below the joint. A transverse incision at each end of this will allow the skin to be fully reflected. A few branches of the smaU sciatic and internal cutaneous nerves may be found in the superficial fascia, which is to be removed in order to expose the deep fascia.] The following cutaneous stractm-es will be exposed on reflecting the skin: over the upper, part of the space a few branches of the small sciatic nerve, with the terminal branch of that nerve piercing the deep fascia opposite the knee joint, and subsequently supplying the integument on the back of the leg: the external saphenous vem will also be seen piercing the deep fascia at the lower part of the space, accompanied by the superficial lymphatics of the back of the leg. Deep or Popliteal Fascia.—This is continuous with the fascia lata, and strengthened by fibres fi-om the hamstring tendons. It stretches across the popKteal space to protect the vessels and nerves beneath, and is tense when the limb is extended, but is at once relaxed on bending the knee. [The fascia being removed, the hoUow of the ham will be brought into view fiUed with loose fat, which is to be removed to expose the popliteal vessels and nerves. The internal popliteal neive and the pophteal vessels will appear in the middle of the T^!fr;ii 1 ■"^^'^^ its outer boundary.

The popliteus can only be seen when the inner head of the gastro- cnemius is divided near its origin and tiu-ned down. The Internal Popliteal Nerve (Fig. 64, 7) is the most super- ficial of the important structures in the ham. It is the larger diA'ision of the great sciatic nerve, and 2)asses down the middle of the space, disappearing beneath the gastrocnemius muscle. It crosses fi'om the outer to the inner side of the popliteal artery, which it accompanies to the lower border of the popliteus muscle. Its branches are (1) articular, three in number, which accompany the two internal and the azygos articular arteries ; (2) muscular to the gastrocnemius (one to each head), soleus, plantaris and popliteus; the branch of the popliteus being peculiar in that it riuis upon the posterior surface of the muscle, then turns upwards around its lower border to enter its anterior or deeper surface; and (3) the ramus commuiiicans tibialis, which lies in the groove between the heads of the gastrocnemius (sometimes beneath a few of its fibres), and will be traced in the cbssection of the back of the leg. The External Popliteal or Peroneal Nerve (Fig. 63, 2), the other division of the great sciatic, is altogether under cover of the biceps at the upper part of the Fig. 04.—Deep dissection of the popliteal space (from Hirsohfeld and Leveille) 1.

It gives a communicating branch {ranms comrnnnicuns peronei vel fibular is) down the back of the leg to form with the com- municans tibialis the external saphenous nerve, and two or three articular branches. Of these, two, sometimes arising together, accompany the two external articular branches of the popliteal artery; the other (the recuiTcnt articular) winds to the front of the joint with the recurrent branch of the anterior tibial arteiy. An external cutaneous nerve to the outer side of the leg arises either from the external popliteal itself, or more frequently from the communicans fibularis. The sciatic nerve may be found at the upper angle of the space when its bifurcation is unusually low. The Popliteal Artery (Fig. 63, 8) is the continuation of the femoral artery, and extends from the opening in the adductor magnus to the lower border of the popliteus muscle, where it divides into anterior and posterior tibials. It lies near the bottom of the popliteal space, separated from the back of the femur by a layer of fat about a quarter of an inch in thickness; but it is in dii-ect contact with the posterior ligament of the knee, and the . popliteus muscle and fascia. It has a direction fi'om the inner side of the femur to the middle of the leg. Its vein is fii-st to its outer side, then crosses it superficially and lies slightly to its inner side below, whilst the internal popliteal nerve is still more super- ficial, and also crosses the arterjr from without inwards. The commencement of the popliteal artery is under cover of the semi- membranosus, the middle of the vessel is in the hoUow of the ham, uncovered by muscles, and its lower part is beneath the gasti-ocne- mius and plantaris muscles. A branch of the obtiu-ator nerve may be found on the upper part of the arteiy, and ti-aced to the back of the knee joint. ■ The Branclies (Figs. 63 and 64) of the popUteal artery are-^ superior and inferior muscular to the hamstrings and muscles of the calf, and articular to the knee-joint. 1. The Superior muscular branches arise from the u]iper part «'t the artery, and are cKstributed to the adjacent hamstring nuisclos. anastomosing with the perforating and terminal branches of the profunda. 2. The Articular branches are five in niunber, viz., two supenor. two inferior, and one azygos. The superior arteries, internal and external, arise just above the condyles of the femur, and wind horizontally inwards and outward.'? to the front of the knee-joint to supply it; and to anastomose with one another, with the anastomotica magna, and the descendingTHE BACK OF THE THIGH. l-il branch of the external circumflex and the other arteries about the joint. The external passes beneath the tendon of the biceps, the internal beneath those of the adductor maguus and inner ham- strings. The inferior articular arteries arise on the popliteus. The inttrmd (the lower of the two) runs obliquely downwards and inwards below the inner tuberosity of the tibia, following the upper border of the popliteus and passing beneath the long portion of the internal lateral ligament; the external passes horizontaUy outwards altogether above the head of the fibula, between the external lateral ligament and the semilunar fibro-cartilage, to the fi'ont of the joint. The azyips arises about the middle of the artery, and pierces the posterior ligament with the obtui-ator nerve to supply the synovial membrane and crucial Kgaments, and to join the other branches. 3. The/?i/e?-/o?-mHsaj?«r branches (sm-al) are distributed to the muscles of the calf. ^The Popliteal Vein (Kg. 64, 3) is formed by the junction of the anterior and posterior tibial veins at the lower border of the popHteus. The vein is superficial to the artery, and Ues slightly to its mner side at the lower part of the space, but crosses to the outer side above. It receives tributaries coiTesponding to the branches of the artery and, at a variable point, the external saphenvus vein which hes on the back of the leg between the heads of the gastrocne- mius, _ opens mto it. Like the supei-ficial femoral vein, it is sometimes represented by two venae comites, one of which is much arger than the other. The popliteal vein is remarkable for the thichiess of Its waUs, and for its close adhesion to the subjacent Pom- or five smaU lymphatic cjlands are placed close to the artery Ihey receive the superficial lymphatics accompanying the external saphenous vein from the back of the leg and heel, and deep lym- phatics accompanying the venae comites of the anterior and tibial ai-tenes from the bones, muscles, &c. The efferent vessels end in the deep femoral glands. The Back of the Thigh.

The gracilis and sartoriiis might also be regarded as inner hamstrings. The biceps and semi- tendinosus, which arise in common, are superficial to the semi- membranosus near the tuber ischii, and the semi-tendinosus maintains this relation to the semi-membranosus throughout. The short head of the biceps will be found on the outer side of the lower part of the femur. The Biceps (Fig. 62, 19) or outer hamstring arises by its long head from the lower and inner aspect of the tuber ischii, in common with the semi-tendinosus, and from the great sacro-sciatic liga- ment, with the fibres of which it is in direct continuity. It crosses the great sciatic nerve and, by diverging from the semi-membra- nosus in the lower fourth of the thigh, forms the outer boundary of the popliteal space. The short head (20), which is fleshy, arises from the outer lip of the linea aspera, nearly as high as the insertion of the gluteus maximus, and from its outer division to within two inches of the condyle, and from the external intermuscular septum. The two heads having united opposite the lower end of the femm-, the muscle is inserted into the bicipital tuberosity on the outer side of the head of the fibula, into the fascia of the leg, and by a slip which passes in front of the tibio-fibvilar joint into the adjacent portion of the external tibial tuberosity. The tendon splits to enclose the lower end of the long external lateral Ugament, from which it is separated by a bursa (Fig. 63, 2). The Semi-tendinosus (Fig. 62, 19) arises by fleshy fibres fi-om the tendon of the biceps, and in common with it from the lower and inner portion of the back of the tuber ischii. It forms one of the inner boundaries of the popliteal space, and ends m a long slender tendon, which Ues on the semi-membranosus posterior to the o-racilis, and passes to be inserted into the deep fascia of the leg and into the tibia below the inner tuberosity; it lies there beneath the tendon of the sartorius and below that of the gracilis, and sur- rounded by a bursa common to it and the two muscles named Its fibres are crossed by a tendinous intersection m the middle ot the thigh. x 1 +1 The Semi-membranosus (Fig. 62, 21), though one of tl internal hamstrings, is external to the biceps at its origin It a by a strong tendon from the outer and upper part of the tuber ischii, and passing beneath the origins of the biceps and semi- tendinosus, spreads into a broad tendon from which the muscular fibres arise to form a thick boUy that extends nearly as low as the knee. It is inserted by a short strong tendon into an impres- sion at the back of the inner surface of the internal tuberosity ot 10 ;•).- -THE GREAT SCIATIC NERVE. J 48 the tibia and into a horizontal groove in front of this, beneath the internal lateral ligament of the knee. It gives off two expansions, one running upwards and outwards to the femur above the outer condyle, formmg the oblique fasciculus of the posterior ligament of the knee-joint, and the other to cover the popliteus muscle (Fig. 72, 9). Its tendon is separated from the inner head of the gastrocnemius and from the knee-joint by a bursa, which frequently commimicates with the articulation; and a second bursa will be found between it and the internal lateral ligament. Action.—The hamstring muscles flex the leg upon the thigh, and extend the thigh upon the pelvis, as in walking or running, and when the knee is flexed the inner hamstrings, with the popliteus gracilis and sartorius, rotate the leg inwards (pronation), and the biceps rotates it outwards (supination). When the knee is extended and the leg is the fixed point, they extend the trunk and aid in maintaining the erect posture of the body. They also assist the glutei m regulating the flexion of the trunk, by controUing the force of gravitation. If the thigh be flexed while the knee is extended the hamstrings and gi-eat sciatic nerve become very tense and when great force is used these structures may be rup- tui-ed. Hence the knees must always be flexed when the subject is placed m the lithotomy position for dissection of the pei-inteum. Ihe hamstrings are supjdied by the great sciatic nerve. The Great Sciatic Nerve (Fig. 62, i5), see page 136, is con- tmued from the buttock and, after leaving the quadratus femoris lies on the posterior surface of the adductor magnus, to which it gives a branch, and passes beneath the long head of the biceps supplymg this and the semi-membranosus and semi-tendinosus At a variable pomt, but generally about the middle of the thi-h' the nerve divides into the internal and external popHteal trunks.'w'hich have been already traced. Beneath the sciatic nerve will be seen the posterior surface of the adductor magnus, and piercing the muscle, at various points close to Its insertion, are the terminations of the perforating artmes fi-om the profunda and the terminal branch of the artery itself which arc now seen to supply the hamstring muscles (.. p. 123) The terminal branch of the internal circu^nflex ari ry, between the ^^:tZr^ adductor magnus, can now also'be ml fu^^; The PoPLiTEua muscle is described on page lo" i .1 aissected, but the joint itself should not bo opened.144 THE HIP-JOINT. Opportunity should now Le taken to trace the reilectod tendon of the rectus femoris, arising from a rough impression above the acetabulum. When the subject is replaced on its back, the front of the joint is also to be dissected by removing the psoas and iliacus and the remains of the pectineus. After learnmg the Fig. 65. external Hgaments, the joint may be opened and the intracapsulax- structures examined. The limb may then be removed.] The Hip-Joint is the best example in the body of an enartlu-o- dial or ball-and-socket joint, and is furnished with a powerful capsular ligament, besides other articular structui-es.

BelaUons.—The hip-joint has in front the united psoas and ihacus and the outer edge of the pectineus, and more supei-ficiaUy he the rectus, the femoral yessels and the anterior crural nerve; behind, are the pyriformis, obtiu'ator internus, and gemelli, the obtm-ator externus and upper fibres of the quadi-atus femoris, with the sciatic nerves and vessels lying upon them close to the posterior margm of the acetabulum; above and externally, lie the gluteus mmimus and the ilio-trochanteric band; and below s.nA internaUy, are the tendon of the obturator externus and the pectineus (Fig. 65). The ligaments of the hip-joint are of two kinds, those which com- plete and deepen the socket—the transverse and cotyloid; and those which connect the two bones—the capsular and the round. The Capsular Ligament (Fig. 67 , i) is attached immediately outside the margin of the acetabulum, and to the transverse ligament above; and surrounds the upper end of the femur below. Its upper attach- ment follows the acetabular border, but extends beyond this to the anterior inferior iHac spme above, to the body of the ischium at its junction with the ilium behind, and to the body of the os pubis and obturator externus fascia in front.

TuK Back ok the Leg. [A vertical incision througli the centre of the remaining portion of skin on the back of the leg, joined by a short transverse cut at the heel, will permit the reflection of the skin to each side.] The External Saphenous Nerve (Fig. 68, 8) is formed by the junction of the communicans tibialis and fibularis, which branches pierce the deep fascia of the caK midway between the knee and the ankle. The nerve thus fonned runs along the outer side of the tendo AchilHs, to pass behind the external malleohis to the outer side of the foot and little toe. This nerve or the external popliteal gives off one or more external cutaneous branches to the outer side of the leg. A branch or two of the internal sajthenous nerve (7) may be fouud on the inner side of the back of the leg. The termination of the smaU sciatic nerve may also be seen at th& middle of the back of the leg. The External Saphenous Vein (Fig. 68, 6) arises from the outer side of the dorsal venous arch of the foot, and passes behind the external malleolus close to the external saphenous nerve, then, running up the centre of the leg, it pierces the deep fascia at the point where the communicans tibialis nerve emerges, or at the level of the popUteal space ; it has been already traced to the popliteal vein. It is often joined to the internal saphenous vein by a large branch which leaves it close to its termination. The External Deep Fascia of the leg is continuous with that of the thigh. It receives reinforcements from the hamstring muscles, and gives origin to the fibres of the tibialis anticus and extensor longus digitorum in front of the leg. It is adherent to the periosteum of the subcutaneous surface of the tibia, and from its deep sm-face pass two principal intermuscular septa, one in front of and one behind the peronei longus and brevis; besides a smaller septum between the extensor digitorum longus and the tibialis anticus. Beneath the gastrocnemius will be found deep fascial investments, one for the popUteus, mainly derived from the tendon of the semi-membranosus, the other, beneath the solous, for the flexor longus digitorum, tibialis posticus, and flexor longus hallucis. Near the ankle this subsoleal iutennuscular fascia and the anterior portion of the external deep fascia become continuous, and form the annular ligaments wliich bind down the foot tendons to tlic tibia and fibula. [The deep fascia of the leg is to bo removed, except near the maUeoh, where thickened portions passing on each side between that bone and the calcaneum, called the internal and externalTHE BACK OF THK LEG. 150 Fig. 68. annular ligaments, are to be preserved. The muscles of the calf are then to be dissected, after being put on the stretch by supporting the knee and drawing the toes towards the front of the leg.] The Gastrocnemius (Eig. 69, 4), the superficial muscle of the calf, has a double-headed oriijln from the back of the femur immediately above the condjdes, the origin of the outer head extending into a little depression above the back of the pop- liteal groove ^ipon the external suiiace of the outer tuberosity, while that of the inner head runs upwards for about an inch along the internal supra- condyloid ridge. A. bursa, sometimes commmiicatiug with the knee-joint, lies upon the back of the capsule beneath the inner head and the tendon of the semi-membranosus. The two heads (with the plantaris on the outer side), are the lower boujidaries of the popliteal space, and unite to form one large muscle, the fibres of which end about the middle of the leg in a broad thin tendon that is joined anteriorly | and laterally by the soleus. The con- joined tendon contracts near the heel into the thick rounded teiah Achillis (6), which expands again slightly, to be inserted into the middle part of the posterior surface of the calcanemn, a hiirsa intervening between it and the upper part of this surface of the bone.

The Plantaris (Fig. 63, condyle of the femiu- and supra-condyloid ridge for about an inch, the muscle Ipng internally to and above the outer head of the gastrocnemius; a few fibres rise fi'om the jjosterior ligament of the knee-joint. Its fleshy fibres are about thi'ee inches long, but its tendon is the longest in the body and is very slender. It is placed between the gasti'ocnemius and soleus, and crosses obliquely to reach the mner side of the tendo Achillis, by the side of or in common with which it is inserted into the OS calcis. It is homologous to the palmaris longus of the upper extremity, and is subject to like variations (p. 47). The Soleus (Pig. 69, 5) is tendinous on its siu'face, and between it and the corresponding tendinous expansion on the deep surface of the gastrocnemius is a quantity of loose areolar tissue. It arises from the oblique line of the tibia, from the middle thii-d of the inner border of the bone, from the posterior sm-face of the head and upper third or more of the shaft of the fibula, from the intermuscular septum between it and the peroneus longus, and from a tendinous arch between the tibial and fibular origins over the vessels and nerves. The fibres end in a broad tendon, which joins that of the gastrocnemius below the middle of the leg to foi-m the tendo Achillis, the insertion of which has been seen. The muscular fibres are inserted into the deep surface of the common tendon to within two inches of the heel. Fig. 69.—Superficial muscles of the back of the leg (from Wilson) Tendou of biceps. 7.

By dividing the fibres of tlie soleu? vei-tically and with care, a tendinous expansion on the deep surface of the muscle will be brought into view, which stretches across the deep muscles and the posterior tibial vessels and nerve. This deep tendon is an important guide in the operation of tying the posterior tibial artery, and must be divided to reach it. ■The muscles of the calf are plantar flexors* of the foot, i.e., point the toes, the gastrocnemius and plantaris, in addition, flexing the leg upon the thigh; or, when taking their fixed point below they may act upon the thigh. They are supplied by the internal popliteal nerve, a separate branch passiiig to each head of the gastrocnemius, and the soleus receives an additional branch from the posterior tibial nerve. [The plantaris is to be divided and the soleus cut near its attach- ments to the tibia and fibula, when those muscles and the gastroc- nemius are to be turned down, and the bursa between the tendon and the os calcis noticed. The posterior tibial vessels and nerve, partially covered by the deep layer of fascia, will now be exposed, and beneath them the deep muscles of the leg, with the popliteus covered by its fascia above.] The Popliteus (Fig. 71, L) is covered by a strong fascia which is mainly derived from the tendon of the semi-membranosus,- and upon which rest the lower parts of the popliteal vessels and nerve. This must be removed to expose the oblique fibres of the muscle, and an incision must be made through the capsule of the knee * The terms flexion and extension as applied to the ankle are applied in opposite senses by different anatomists, and it is hence desirable to avoid their use altogether.

The popHteus arises from within the general capsule of the knee (though outside the synovial cavity) by a round tendon, which is fixed to the anterior extremity of the popliteal groove on the outer side of the external tuberosity, below and a little in front of the tubercle for the attachment of the external lateral ligament. The tendon passes beneath the long external lateral ligament, and is intimately connected with the short external lateral ligament. It occupies the long popKteal groove only during flexion, but occasionally a short extension groove is foimd upon the border of the outer condyle. It grooves the external semilunar cartilage and runs obliquely over the back of the outer tuberosity of the tibia just above the superior tibio-fibular joint, sometimes establishing a communication between this articulation and the knee-joint by means of the bui-sal exten- sion of the synovial membrane of the knee which invests it. It is inserted into nearly the whole of the triangular surface on the back of the upper part of the tibia, above the oblique line. The popliteus is a flexor of the leg upon the thigh, and rotates the tibia inwards dui-ing flexion. It is supposed also to produce that slight rotation inwards of the tibia, which takes place at the commencement of flexion of the knee. It is supplied by a branch of the internal popliteal nerve, which winds round the lower border to reach the anterior surface of the muscle. [The deep sub-soleal or intermuscular layer of fascia of the leo- bemg removed, the posterior tibial vessels and nerve are to be cleaned, when the subjacent muscles will be found in the following positions:—flexor longus digitorum most internally, tibialis posticus m the middle, and flexor longus hallucis to the outer side.] The Flexor Longus Digitorum (Fig. 72, 13) is a penniform muscle arisimj from the posterior sm'face of the tibia below the oblique line, and internally to the attachment of the tibialis posticus (from which it is separated by an indistinct vertical ridge and an mtermuscular septum), the lower fibres of the muscle reacliing to within three mches of the lower end of the tibia. It ends in a single tendon, which crosses to the outer side of that of the tibiaUs posticus at the ankle, and passes thi-ough a separate division of the intei-nal annular ligament; then upon the inner surface of the siistentaculum tali to the solo of the foot, where it will be seen Dreading up into four tendons, which give origin to the lumbiicales and afterwards perforate the tendons of the short flexor, to become inserted into the ungual phalanges of the four outer toes.

The Tibialis Posticus (Fig. 72, 15) is the only one of the deep muscles which is attached to both bones of the leg. It is covered by an aponeui'osis, which forms septa between it and the adjacent muscles. It arises from the posterior surface of the tibia, below the oblique line and externally to the flexor longus digitorum, the origin extending to within two inches of the ankle; fi-om nearly the whole length of the inter- osseous membrane; from the whole of the internal surface of the fibvda imme- diately behind the interosseous line, and fi-om the intermuscular septa on each side. The fibres end in a single broad tendon, which passes beneath that of the flexor digitorum at the ankle, and then to its inner side, run- ning in a groove at the back of the internal malleolus and in the most internal division of the annular liga- ment to the sole ; where, after passing Fig. 72.—Arteries of the back of the leg (from Bouamy and Beau). 1.

The Flexor Longus Hallucis (Fig. 72, 30) is a well-marked bipenniform muscle, arising from the jjosterior surface of the fibula below the origin of the soleus to within an inch of the ankle; and also fi'om the intermuscular septa between it and the peronei muscles externally and the tibialis posticus internally, and from the lower part of the interosseous membrane. The muscle ends, at the level of the ankle-joint, in a tendon which lies on the back of the tibia to the outer side of the posterior tibial vessels and nerve; and, passing thi'ough a separate division of the annular ligament, winds to the sole of the foot thi-ough a gi-oove on the posterior smiace of the astragalixs and beneath the sustentaculum tali to reach the imgual phalanx of the great toe, where it is inserted. Its tendon gives a slip to that of the flexor longus digitorum in the sole. The flexor longus hallucis and flexor digitori,im are direct flexors of the toes and plantar flexors of the foot. The tibialis posticus is also a plantar flexor and an adductor of the foot, thefii-st movement taking place at the ankle-joint, the second at the articulation formed by the astragalus with the calcaneum and scaphoid (talo-calcaneo- scaphoid joint), and helps the other tendons to maintain the longitu- dinal arch of the foot, giving powerful support to the keystone (head of the astragalus). The flexor longus haUucis, by means of its accessory sHp to the flexor cUgitorum, aids in the flexion of the toes. The three muscles are supplied by the posterior tibial nerve. The Posterior Tibial Artery (Fig. 72, 11) is the direct con- tmuation of the po])liteal artery, and begins at the point of bifui'ca- tion of that vessel, which is usually the lower border of the popliteus muscle. In the upper part of its coui'se the posterior tibial artery lies between the superficial and deep muscles of the back of the leg, but below the oiigin of the soleus it is only boimd down by a pro- longation of the intermuscular layer of fascia, and lies by the side of the tendo Achillis. It rests (in the position for dissection) upon the tibialis posticus for two-thirds of its length, then upon the flexor digitonun, and at the ankle upon the tibia between the tendons of the flexor digitorum and flexor longus hallucis. The vesse afterwards passes thi'ough a special canal in the internal annular bgament to the interval between the inner malleolus and the heel, where it divides into internal and external plantar arteries, ihe postenor tibial ueiwe is in a close relation to the artery throughout, lying first to it^ inner sidp and then crogsjng156 rHE BACK OF THE LEG. superficially to its outer side, in which relation it continues to the foot. The artery has two venai comites, which join those of the anterior tibial artery to form the popliteal vein. The Branches (Figs. 72,73) of the posterior tibial artery are (1) pero- neal; (2) muscular; (3) medullar^^ to the tibia; (4)communicating; and (5) internal calcanean. I. The Peroneal (Fig. 72, i8), always of considerable size and sometimes larger than the pos- terior tibial, comes ofE about two inches below the popliteus. It lies at first between the tibialis posticus and the soleus, but afterwai-ds passes into the fibres of the flexor haUucis, and runs close to the inner border of the fibtda almost as far as the lower end of that bone. In this part of its coui-se it gives mm- cnlar branches, and the meduUarii artery to the fibula, which has a downward direction; i.e., runs from the knee-j oint.

Its terminal branch is the ('■.rternul ralraneun, which passes over the posterior inferior tibio-fibular ligament to anastomose with the maUeolar arteries and supply the outer side of the calcaueiun, there joining with the caleanean branches of the posterior tibial and with the external plantar. 2. Muscular branches are given to the deep muscles and also to the soleus. The highest of these may send a twig to join the anastomosis about the knee. 3. The Medullar ij artery to the tibia is of large size, and enters the foramen on the posterior siu'face of that bone; it arises from the upper part of the posterior tibial, and has a dii-ection from the knee-joint. 4. A Cmnmunkatiiig (17) branch runs transversely immediately above the ankle to join the peroneal artery or its posterior terminal branch. 6. The Internal Caleanean (23) is a branch of variable size, and may be replaced by two or more separate arteries. It arises from the posterior tibial beneath the internal annular Hgament, piercing the latter to supply the inner side of the os calcis with the adjacent structui-es and the integument, and to anastomose with the caleanean branches of the peroneal and external plantar. The Anterior Tibial Artery (Pig. 73, 4) is seen just before it pierces the interosseous membrane to reach the front of the leg. It gives off two branches while in this position : the posterior tiUul recurrent, which rims upward over the head of the fibula, to anas- tomose with the inferior external articular ; and the superior fibular which winds around the neck of the fibula to anastomose with the anterior tibial recurrent.

The Plantar Fascia (Fig. 79, 2) closely resembles the fascia of the palm, and is divisible into three portions. The central, which is the strongest, is attached to the under surf ace of the gi-eat tuberosity of the OS calcis, but, as it passes forwards, expands to nearly the entire width of the foot. It splits into five portions opposite the heads of the metatarsal bones, and at tliis point distmct transverse fibres will be seen passing across the foot, beneath the longitudinal fibres. The five processes are attached to the sides of the proximal phalanx, and to the sheath of the flexor tendons of each toe, and between them pass the several digital vessels and nerves. A superficial transverse lujament, like the fascia of Gerdy m the hand, may be seen in the skin of the web of the toes, passing over the digital vessels and nerves, and becoming continuous with the fascia of the toes and dorsum of the foot. The central portion of the fascia gives origin to muscular fibres by its deep surface, and also by two intermuscular septa, which wiU subsequently be seen on each side of the flexor brevis digitorum. The lateral portions of the plantar fascia are much thmner than that in the centre, and mainly cover the muscles of the great and little toes on the inner and outer sides of the foot, but there is u strong band on the outer side running fi-om the outer tubercle of the calcaneum to the base of the fifth metatarsal bone. ■pig, 76.—The front of the leg (from Madise's Surgical Anatomy).

[The central portion of the fascia is to be cut across about two niches from the heel and may then be turned down over the toes without injunng the digital nerves, when the flexor brevis cHgitorum will be exposed m part, and the intermuscular septa on each side may be seen. The lateral portions of the fascia are to be removed, and the abductor hal- lucis and abductor minimi digiti cleaned.] The First Layer of Muscles consists of the flexor brevis digitorum in the middle, the abducior hallucis to the inner side, and the abductor minimi digiti to the outer side. The Flexor Brevis Digi- torum (Fig. 80, ii) arises ivom. the anterior border of the inner tuberosity of the os calcis; from the plantar fascia covering it (which has therefore been left undistui'bed); and fi-om the in- termuscular septa on each side. It divides into four tendons, which pass into tendinous sheaths on the under sui'faces of the four smaller toes, and are perforated by the tendons of the long flexor as in the hand (p. 74) ; and are inserted, each by two slips, into the sides of the second pha- langes. The tendon to the little toe is often a mere thread. Fig. 79. Fig. 79.-Superficial nerves of the^s^le of the foot (from Hirschfeld and 1. 1. Cutaneous plantar brauchea of posterior tibial nerve. 2.

UTHE SOLE OF THE FOOT 162 The sheaths of the tendons resemble those of the hand, but are smaUer Beginning over the heads of the metatarsal bones, each sheath is joined by a process of plantar fascia, and then extends to the base of the terminal phalanx "^'^^^^ - ~te ■ Fig. 80. The sheath is strong opposite the shaft of each phalanx (/fVya- mmtam vagiiiale), but thinner over the joints, so as not to impede their motion; and, when divided, will be found to be lined by a synovial mem- brane which is reflected over the tendens. Small elastic bands {vrncula vasciilosa) con- nect each tendon of the flexor brevis with the front o£ the first phalanx, as in the hand. The Abductor Hallucis (Fig. 80, 7) arises horn the in- ternal annular ligament; fi-om the inner tuberosity on the under surface of the os calcis (internal to the origin of the flexor brevis digitorvim); from the plantar fascia and the intermuscidar septum between it and the flexor brevis digi- torum; and from the fascia on the inner side of the foot. The muscle ends in a broad tendon which is joined by the inner head of the flexor brevis hal- lucis, and is i,>serte<I into the Fig. 80.-Superficial dissection of the sole of Greater tuberosity of os calcis.

The Abductor Minimi Digiti (Fig. 80, 4) arises fi-om the outer and inner tuberosities of the os calcis in front of the flexor breyis digitorum; from the plantar fascia and intermuscular septum; and from the fascia of the outer border of the foot as far forward as the base of the fifth metatarsal bone. Its tendon is rnsfirted into the outer side of the base of the fii-st phalanx of the little toe.* The actions of the superficial muscles of the foot are partly indicated by their names, but it should be remarked that abduction and adduction are fi-om and to the median plane of the foot and not of the body. The abductors are also flexors of the toes with which they are connected, and the whole of the plantar muscles aid in mamtaining the longitudinal arch of the foot. The flexor brevis digitorum and abductor hallucis are suppUed by the niternal plantar nerve; the abductor minimi digiti by the external plantar nerve. [To bring the deeper parts into view, the best way will be to remove with the saw a thin slice of the os calcis, including the attachments of the superficial muscles, when, if the attachment of tfie abductor hallucis to the internal annular ligament be divided, they can be turned forwards, and the plantar nerves and vessels will be seen. I The Plantar Arteries (Pig. 81), internal and external, are the terminal branches of the posterior tibial, and enter the foot beneath the abductor hallucis and in close relation with the plantar nerves i-he internal plantar artery, which is the smaller of the two is accompanied by the large internal plantar nerve, the large external plantar artery going with the smaller external nerve. Both vessels are accompanied by vence comites. The Internal plantar artery (7) is usually of smaU size, and runs iorward m the fascial septum between the abductor hallucis and flexor brevLs digitorum to the great toe, where it anastomoses with the intemal and commimicating branches of the dorsal artery of the foot. If well injected it may sometimes be traced with the nerve to the third interosseous space, joining the digital branches to the three inner toes. The Ea:ternal plantar artery (4) runs obliquely outwards across the M 2THE SOLE OF THE FOOT. 164 foot between the flexor brevis digitorum and the accessonuB muscle, and ttmiing round tbe outer border of the latter, courses inwards beneath the digital tendons towards the great toe, where it wiU be subsequently traced, joining the Fig. 81. communicating branch of the dorsal artery of the foot and completing the deep i)lantar arch. It is accompanied by the external plantar nerve (which also gives a deep branch across the foot) and supplies the ad- jacent muscles, giving a branch to the outer side of the foot to anastomose with the external calcanean branch of the pero- neal artery. The Plantar Nerves (Fig. 82). internal and external, are the branches of the posterior tibial nerve; their relation to the arteries has been mentioned. The Internal plantar nerve (5) is the larger of the two, and, after supplyii^g smaU cutaneous twigs to the sole and muscular branches to the abductor hal- lncis and flexor brevis digitorum, gives off a digital branch to the Siner side of the great toe, and breaks up into three other digital branches, which lie between the plantar fascia and the tendons of the flexor brevis digitorum; Fig. 81.—Deep dissection of the sole 1.

The fii'st digital branch also supplies the flexor brevis hallucis, the second supplies the fii'st lumbrical, and the fourth is jouied by a twig from the external plantar nerve. The External pjlantur nerve (3) crosses the foot with and in fi'ont of the external plantar artery, giving branches to the abductor minimi digiti and accessorius in its coui'se. At the outer border of the accessorius it divides into superficial and deep portions; the deej) accompanies the arterj', and will be seen in a later dis- section. The superficial portion gives cutaneous branches to the outer part of the sole, and divides into two digital branches, one to the outer side of the little toe,—and fi-om this commonlj'- are derived branches to the flexor brevis minimi digiti and the interossei of the fourth space; the other bifiu'cating to supply the contiguous sides of the Uttlo and fourth toes, and to communi- cate with the internal i^lantar. A slender branch of com- munication between the internal and external plantar nerves may sometimes be found.

The Second Layer of Muscles includes the tendons of the Eexor lono-us digitorum and Hexor longus haUucis, with the accessorius" and the lumbricales, all of which should now be cleaned. , The tendon of the Flexor Longus Digitorum (Ing. bi, loj runs upon the inner surface of the sustentaculum tali to the inner side of the vessels and nerves, and crosses beneath these and super- ficial to the tendon of the flexor longus haUucis to reach the centre of the foot, where the fibres of the accessorius are attached to its deep surface; a small slip from the flexor longus hallucis tendon ioining it at a somewhat higher level. It then divides into foui- tendons, which give origin to the lumbricales muscles and pass beneath the digital nerves to the four small toes, where they enter the digital sheaths, lying beneath the tendons of the short flexor Each deep tendon then passes through the slit in the superficial tendon as in the hand, and is inserted into the base of the thii'd or terminal phalanx. c „ The Accessorius (Pig. 82, 8) arises fi-om the under surface of the OS calcis by two heads, between which is seen the long plantar ligament. The inner head, which is fleshy and the larger of the two, is attached to the concave hue separating the mfenor from the internal surf ace of the calcaneum; the outer head which is ten- dinous, is attached to the bone in f lont of the outer tuberosity and to the long plantar ligament. The muscle is inserted into the deep surface and outer border of the flexor longus digitorum, ^f ^^^'^^ slips to the tendons connected with the second, third, and fouith '°The Lumbricales (Fig. 82, i6) are four small muscles, which are so named from their fancied resemblance to earth-woinis They arise fi-om the tendons of the flexor longus digitorum, the most :;ernal from one, and the rest ^wo tendons each and the inner sides of the four small toes to reach tl^-r doi.al a.pe te. where they are inserted into the corresponding sides of the ba.e.. o L proximal phalanges, seldom joining the extensor tendons a. m *^Thrrt/o. of the accessorius is essentially to supplement the lono- flexor and to flex the toes when the flexor longus is relaxed by the elevation of the heel in plantar flexion, ^^-^f^^'^^ bring the Hue of traction of the flexor tendons mto the centre oHhe foot is probably of very trifling service. The degenerateADDUCTOR OBLIQUUS HALLUCIS. 1G7 Ivimbricales of the foot are less important tlian those in the hand, and their function is usually Limited to slight flexion and tibial adduction of the proximal phalanges. The accessorius and the three outer lumbricales are supplied by the external plantar nerve ; and the inner lumbrical by the internal plantar. The tendon of the Flexor Longus Hallucis (Fig. 82, ii), after lying in the groove behind the astragalus and below the sustentaculum tali of the os calcis, runs forward to the great toe, under cover of the plantar vessels and nerves, and is crossed su23er- ficiaUy by the tendon of the flexor digitorum, to which it gives a slip of reinforcement. It then lies between the two heads of the flexor brevis hallucis, and the two sesamoid bones with their con- necting ligament form a deep channel for it; finally it runs in the sheath formed by the ligameutum vaginale luitil its insertion into the base of the terminal phalanx of the great toe. The action of the muscle is to flex the great toe, to assist in the plantar flexion of the ankle, and to maintain the longitudinal arch of the foot. [The long tendons and the accessorius muscle are to be cut about the middle of the foot and tiirned down, when the muscles of the third layer are to be cleaned. In doing this the external plantar vessels and nerve will be more fully, but not yet completely, exposed.] The Third Layer of Muscles consists of the flexor brevis hal- lucis, adductor obliquus hallucis, flexor brevis minimi digiti, and adductor transversus hallucis. The Flexor Brevis Hallucis (Fig. 83, 7) (irises by a narrow tendinous origin from the inner side of the cuboid, and from the prolongation of the tendon of the tibialis posticus to the external and middle cuneiform bones. Its fibres form two heads, which diverge from each other near the head of the metatarsal bone, to be inserted into opposite sides of the base of the first phalanx of the great toe with the ab.luctor and adductors respectively. Each head has developed in its tendon a largo sesamoid bone, which enters into the formation of the metatarso-phalangeal joint. Tlio tendon of the long flexor lies between the two heads of this muscle. The sesamoid bones in the tendon form the anterior resting point or pier of the inner s'do of tlio plantar arch. The Adductor Obliquus Hallucis (Fig. S3, 11) arises from the bases of the second, third, and fourth metatarsal bones, and from the long plantar ligament where it bridges over the peroneus longus t«ndon. It is inserted into the outer side of the base of the first phalanx of the great too, with the outer head of the ihxov brevis.THE SOLE OF THE FOOT. 1()8 Fis. 83. The Adductor Transversus Hallucis (Tl•an^sversus pedis) (Fig. 83, lo) is of variable size, and consists of three or foiu' small bundles, which arise from the plantar transverse metatarsal liga- ment over the heads of the three or four outer metatarsal bones, and separate the tendons and nerves from the interossei and yessels. It is inserted into the outer side of the first jDhalanx of the great toe, with the adductor obliquus and part of the flexor brevis hallucis. Actions.—The flexor brevis, abductor, and adductores hal- lucis act together in flexing the jiroximal jihalanx of the great toe ; the adductors draw the toe towards the middle line of the foot, the abductor in the oppo- site direction. All help to main- tain the plantar arch. The flexor brevis hallucis is supplied by the internal plantar nerve, the other muscles by the external plantar nerve. The Flexor Brevis Minimi Digiti (Fig. 83, 8) arises from the under surface of the pro- jecting base of the fifth meta- tarsal bone and from the sheath of the peroneus lougus, and is inserted into the outer side of the base of the first phalanx of the little toe with the abductor. [The adductors and flexor brevis hallucis are to be cut near their origins and turned down, after which the plantar arch of the external plantar Fig. 83.—Deep muscles of the 1.

This deep portion of the artery has been called the plantar arch, and is joined by the communicating branch of the dorsalis i:)edis artery, which enter.s the sole between the first and second metatarsal bones. Branches.—Small recurrent twigs pass backward from the concavity of the arch to supply the tarsus. Three smaM poster I ar perforating! arteries, given off by the plantar arch, pierce the intervals behind the origins of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th dorsal interosseous muscles, and anas- tomose with the interosseous arteries on the dorsum of the foot. Four diijital arteries arise from the anterior part of the arch; the outer one goes to the outer side of the little toe, the others bifm^cate to supply the adjacent sides of four inner Pis. 84.

The digital arteries run on the sides of the toes with the digital nerves, and anastomose in the pulp of the terminal phalanges. The cnmmiinicating Iran'ch of the dorsalis pedis artery (13) enters the sole between the heads of the first dorsal interosseous muscle, and besides completing the plantar arch, gives off an inner branch, which runs beneath the long flexor tendon to supply the inner side of the great toe, and an outer branch which bifui-cates to supply the adjacent sides of the great and next toe, all anastomosing with the corresponding dorsal branches of the dorsalis pedis. The External Plantar Nerve (Pig. 84, 5)-—The deep portion of the nerve accompanies the artery beneath the adductor obliquus hallucis, in which it ends. It gives small branches to the adductor transversus hallucis, to the thi-ee outer lumbricals, and to all the interosseous muscles, except those of the fourth interosseous space which are supplied by the superficial portion. The Fourth Layer of Muscles consists of the plantar mter- ossei, which wiU be better seen when the dorsal interossei are dissected. Front of the Leg and Foot. TThe skin remaining on the front and outer side of the leg and on the back of the foot is to be removed, and the superficial vems and nerves dissected out of the superficial fascia, after which the deep fascia should be cleaned.] The Superficial Veins form an arch across the dorsiuu of the foot ending in the internal and external saphenous vems on opposite sides. The internal saphenous vein is to be traced from the inner side of the dorsal arch upwards in front of the internal malleolus to the posterior part of the inner side of the knee, ihe external saphenous vein passes from the outer side of the aixn behind the external malleolus to the middle of the back of the leg. Cutaneous Nerves.-On the outer side of the leg are a few cutaneous branches from the external popliteal nerve; and on tne inner side from the lonij sajihenous. _ The Musculo-Cutaneous Nerve (Fig. 8(5, 13) pierces the deep fascia about the lower third of the outer side of the fi-ont of the le , and iust before or after doing so divides into two portions, lie internal division (15) gives branches to the inner side of the ank^ and foot, thou to the inner side of the great too, the outer side 01 the second, and the inner side of the third too: frequently also oiving a .''mall branch to join the anterior tibial nerve between171 THE FASCIA OF THE LEG. the first and second toes. The oater division (17) supplies the outer side of the third toe, both sides of the fourth, and the inner side of the fifth toe, and gives a communicating- branch to the external saphenous nerve. In some cases its area of distribution is encroached upon by the latter. The External Saphenous Nerve (Fig. 86, 21) winds around the external malleolus from the back of the leg, and is distributed to the outer side of the little toe, or occasionally to both sides of the little toe and half the next, joining the musculo-ciitaneous nerve. The Anterior Tibial Nerve (Fig. 86, 16) runs beneath the annular ligament and to the outer side of the dorsaUs pedis artery, after giving off an urtlculuf branch to the ankle, and an cxkrnal branch beneath the extensor brevis digitorum to supply it and the tarsal and tarso-metatarsal articulations; it often presents a pseudo- ganglionic enlargement due to tliickening of its sheath. The teriiiinaJ branch receives a branch of communication from the inner di vision of the musculo-cutaneous, and is then prolonged upon the first dorsal interosseous muscle ; it ends by bifurcation into two digital branches to the adjacent sides of the first and second toes, sometimes also supplying the first and second dorsal interossei. The Internal Saphenous Nerve Hes in front of the internal malleolus with the internal saphenous vein, which it accompanies. It may be traced along the inner side of the foot, as far as the ball of the great toe. The Fascia of the Leg is dense and white, and is attached to the subcutaneous sm-face of the tibia on the inner side and to the anterior and posterior external borders of the fibula on the outer side, forming intermuscular septa between the peronei longus and brevis and the adjacent muscles. It gives origin to muscular fibres at the upper part of the leg, where it should therefore bo allowed to remain undisturbed; but the rest shoidd be removed, except a thickened band over the ankle joint, the (interior annular lii/amcnt (Fig. 76). The anterior annular ligament consists of two parts, one passing from the tibia to the fibula, and having a separate compartment lined with a synovial sheath for the tibialis anticus tendon, while the rest of the structures pass beneath it; the other being attached externally to the upper surface of the os calcis in front of the calcaneo-astragalar interosseous ligament, and reaching internally, by two more or loss distinct bands, the inner malleolus and the inner row of tarsal bones. This latter portion has tbree compartments lined by synovial sheaths, for (1) the tibialis anticus, (2) extensor longus hallucis, and (Ij) extensor longus digitorum and peroneus tertius; the anterior tibial vessels and nerve pass beneath172 THE FRONT OF THE LEG. the ligament, and are crossed superficially by tlie tendon of the extensor lougus hallucis. A similar hand between the external malleolus and the outer sui-face of the calcaneum is called the external annular ligament, and encloses the tendons of the peroneus longus and brevis at first in a single Fig. 85. sheath which, afterwards, is divided into two on reaching the peroneal tubercle. The internal annular //(/ams)?* passing from the inner malleolus to the cal- caneum has been described (p. 158). [After defining the anterior annular ligament, the fascia is to be taken from the muscles on the fi'ont of the leg, and the latter, together with their tendons on the dorsum of the foot, as well as the vessels and nerves, are to be cleaned.] The Extensor Muscles (Fig. 85) are the tibialis auticus on the inner side; the extensor longus digitomm with the peroneus tertius on the outer side ; and between the two, the exten- sor longus hallucis, appearing below the middle of the leg. The Tibialis Auticus (Fig. 85, 3) arises from the upper two-thu-ds of the outer surface of the shaft of the tibia and from its outer tuberosity: from the inner half of the interosseous ligament for the same distance; fi-om the fascia covering the muscle, and from a septum prolonged between it Fj„ 85.—Muscles of the front of the leg (from Wilson). 1.

The fibres end in a broad tendon, which becomes narrower near the ankle and passes thi'ough the most internal division of the anterior annular ligament, to be inserted into the imder-siirface of the internal cuneiform bone and the base of the metatarsal bone of the great toe. Just before its insertion it grooves the inner side of the internal cuneiform bone. The tibialis anticus is a dorsal flexor of the foot at the ankle-joint, and an adductor at the talo-calcaneo-scaphoid joint. It is supplied by the anterior tibial nerve. The Extensor Longus Digitorum (Fig. 85, 4) arises from the ui^per three-fourths of the anterior surface of the fibula and for about an inch from the adjacent part of the interosseous membrane; fi-om the outer tubero.sity of the tibia close to the tibialis anticus; from the fascia upon the upper part of the muscle, and from, the inter-musciUar septa on either side. The muscular fibres extend nearly as low as the annular ligament, through the outer division of which the tendon passes, and at once divides into fom- to the foui' smaller toes. The insertion of the extensor into the toes is similar to that of the extensor of the fingers, but on a smaller scale. Each tendon forms an expansion on the back of the first j^halanx, and is there joined by the tendons of the corresponding interossei muscles (but seldom by the lumbricales), and in the case of the second, thii-d, and fom-th toes, by a tendon of the extensor brevis digitorum; it is then continued forwards, and divides into three parts, the central portion going to the second phalanx and the lateral stronger pieces to the third phalanx. The action of the extensor longus digitorum is to draw up the foot at the ankle (dorsal flexion) and to extend the four outer toes, chiefly at the metatarso-phalangeal joints; the interossei being the principal extensors of the middle and ungual phalanges. The Peroneus Tertius (Fig. 80, 6) is often a part of the extensor longus digitorum. It arises, below the extensor, from the lower fourth of the anterior sui'face of the fibula; slightly from the interosseous membrane; and from the septum between it and the peroneus brevis. Its tendon passes through the same division of the annular ligament as the extensor longus digitorum, and is inserted into the upper surface of the base of the fifth metatarsal bone, close to the inter-metatarsal joint. Its action is to assist the extensor digitorum as a dorsal flexor, and to abduct the foot at the talo-calcaneo-scaphoid joint. The Extensor Longus Hallucis vel Proprius (Fig. 85 5) appears between the tibialis anticus and the extensor digitorim^ in the lower thu-d of the log. It arises from Ihe mi.ldlo two-fourth.THE FRONT OP THE LEO. 174 of the anterior surface of the fibula, internally to the extensor longus digitorum ; and from the adjacent part of th>'interosseous membrane. Its tendon passes beneath the annular ligament and, crossing the anterior tibial vessels and nerve and the insertion of the innermost tendon of the extensor brevis digitorum, is ivseried into the base of the terminal phalanx of the great toe. This muscle is an extensor of the great toe, and a dorsal flexor of the ankle. The Extensor Brevis Digitorum (Fig. 85, ii) is the only muscle of the dorsum of the foot. It arises from the upper surface of tbe greater process of the os calcis; from the interosseous cal- caneo-asti-agaluid ligament; and fi'om the lower border of the anterior annular ligament. It ends in fom- tendons, the tha-ee outer passing obliquely across the foot to be ixstrted into the second, third, and fourth toes, joining the general expansion of the extensor tendons; the innermgst slip passing to a separate attach- ment into tbe base of the proximal phalanx of the great toe, after crossing over the dorsal artery of the foot. The innermost portion of the muscle is a short extensor of the great toe, acting with tbe long extensor upon the proximal phalanx, and assisting slightly in adduction at the metatarso-phalangeal joint. The remaining segment extends the second, third, and fourth toes, supplementing the long extensor more essentially when this muscle is relaxed during dorsal flexion. The five muscles last described are all supplied by the anterior tibial nerve. . , i, The Anterior Tibial Artery (Fig. 76, L) is a branch of the popliteal, and reaches the front of the leg by piercing the inter- osseous membrane between the two heads of the tibialis posticus, and below the popliteus. Its direction is from a pomt midway between the inner tuberosity of the tibia and the head of the fibula to the centre of the instep. It lies at first upon the interosseous membrane between the tibiaUs anticus and extensor longus digi- torum, and then between the tibialis anticus and extensor propnus haUucis ; in the lower part of the leg it winds on to the tibia and becomes superficial above the ankle-joint. It passes beneath the annular ligament, and is crossed by the extensor longus hallucis near the level of the joint. Its continuation upon the foot is known under the name of dorsalis pedis. It is accompanied by two vence comites; the antenor tibial nervr runs to its outer side as far as about the middle third of the leg. then lies in front of it, but again gets to its outer side in the lower thii'd. A small lymphatic gland is sonietmies found close to the artery about the middle of the leg.THE DORSALIS PEDIS ARTERY. 175 Branches of the anteiior tibial artery in front of the leg :— The anterior tibial Jiccurreiit arises as soon as the artery reaches the front of the leg, and winds through the fibres of the tibialis anticiis or extensor longus digitorum to the front of the knee, to anastomose with the articular arteries. Muscular branches to the adjacent muscles arise at various points. The Mulhdlar arteries, internal and external, the latter being the larger and more constant, pass beneath the tendons to the malleoli, in the neighbourhood of which they are distributed. The external anastomoses with the anterior and jjosterior jDeroneal arteries, and with the tarsal branch of the dorsalis i)edis; the iiiternul with the internal calcanean of the posterior tibial artery. Two small branches are iisually to be found arising fz'om the artery before it pierces the interosseous membrane, the posterior tibial recurrent, passing over the back of the head of the fibula, and the superior fibular, passing outwards over the neck of the bone (p. 157). The Anterior Peroneal branch of the peroneal artery (p. 156) appears between the tibia and fibula thi-ough an opening in the lower part of the interosseous membrane, running ujion the anterior inferior tibio-fibular ligameut and beneath the peroneus tertius to supply the outer malleolus, and to anastomose with the external malleolar and tarsal arteries. The inferior tibio-fibular joiut thus separates the anterior and posterior peroneal arteries. The Dorsalis Pedis Artery (Fig. 86, 12) is the continuation of the anterior tibial from the ankle-joint to the base of the 1st meta- tarsal bone, opposite which it divides into the communicating branch to the sole of the foot and the dorsal artery of the great toe. Its direction is fi-om the centre of the instep to the first interosseous space, and it lies at first superficially between the tendons of the extensor propriushallucis and the extensor longus digitorum, but is crossed near the point of bifurcation by the innermost tendon of the extensor brevis digitorum. It lies upon the astragalus, scaphoid, and midrlle cuneiform bones, and their dorsal ligaments, and has the anterior tibial nerve to its outer side. Two venm comites accompany the vessel. Branches of the dorsalis i)edis artery. A few small unnamed tarsal branches spring from the inner side of the vessel and anastomose with the internnl plantar. The Tarsal arUrg arises from the outer .side of the vessel immediately below the annular ligament, and crosses the foot beneath the extensor brcivis digitorum to anastomose with the arteries about the external malleolus.176 THE FRONT OF THE LEG. The Metatarsal artery arises lower than the preceding aud near the bases of the metatarsal boues. It also runs outwards beneath the extensor brevis digitorum, and gives off three interoaaeout branches to the outer spaces. These run forward upon the dorsal interossei muscles, and bifm-cate at the roots of the toes to supply the adjacent sides of two toes each, the outer one giving off a branch also to the outer side of the little toe. The anterior and posterior perforating arteries, derived from the plantar arch and its digital branches, join these interosseous arteries near their origins and points of bifui-cation. The Communicatiwj branch passes between the heads of the first dorsal interosseous muscle to the sole of the foot, where it joins the plantar arch (p. 170). The Dorsalis halluds rmis forward upon the great toe and, alter giving a branch which passes to its inner side beneath the Ion- extensor tendon, bifurcates to supply the adjacent sides of the fir.st and second toes. ■. p . v The Anterior Tibial Nerve (Kg. 86, 4) is a branch ot the external popHteal nerve; it runs obUquely around the outer side of the neck of the fibula in the fibres of the peroneus longus, and reaches the anterior tibial artery by piercing the extensor longus di-itorum It lies' to the outer side of the artery m the upper part of°the leg, but in fi'ont of it about the middle, and reaches its outer side agaSl at the ankle. Its muscular relations are the same as those of the artery, with which it passes tmder the annular hga- ment In the leg it supplies the four extensor muscles, and as soon as it enters the foot gives a filament to the ankle-joint and divides into two branches. The outer hvanch (19) is distributed to the extensor brevis digitorum and the articulations of the tarsal and tarso-metatarsal joints, having a pseudo-gaugliform thickening of its sheath; the mner branch (16) Ues to the outer side of the dorsal artery, supplies rarely the 1st dorsal interosseous muscle and becoming cutaneous is distributed to the adjacent sides of the great and second toes. [The peroneal muscles are to be exposed on the outer side of the leg by removing the fascia covering them, when a strong inter- muscular septum will be found on each side attached to the fibula, separating them from the muscles of the front and back of the leg A portion of the fascia is to be left below the malleolus to form an external annular ligament.] The Peroneus Longus (Fig. So, 7) anSes slightly from the outer tuberosity of the tibia ; from the head and upper two-thn: of the outer surface of the fibula, its origin in the middle thir177 THE PERONEUS LONGUS. lying behind that of the peroneus brevis and overlapping it; from the intermuscular septum on each side; and from the fascia cover- ing it. It ends in a strong tendon, which lies superficial to that of the peroneus brevis and runs behind the external malleolus and under the external annular ligament; it then passes in a separate sheath of fascia along the outer side of the OS calcis behind the peroneal tubercle to reach the cuboid bone, around which it turns to the sole of the foot. In the sole the tendon runs at first over a facet beneath the outer border of the ridge of the cuboid, then lies in the groove of the cuboid bone and in an osseo-fibrous sheath; it is inserted into the lower part of the outer side of the base of the first metatarsal bone, and into the adjacent part of the internal cuneiform. The sheath of the tendon is fonned superficially by fibres of the long plantar ligament, and is Kned with a bursal membrane. The tendon has a sesamoid cartilage or bone developed in its fibres where it turns round the border of the cuboid bone.

The Peroneus Brevis (Fig. 85, 8) lies beiieatli the peroiieus longus, and arises from the lower two-thirds of the outer surface of the^fibula, its upper part being in front of the lower part of the origin of the peroneus longus; and from the intermuscular septa on'each side. It rests upon the lower part of the fibula, and its tendon winds behind the external malleolus, where it is lodged m a groove beneath the tendon of the peroneus longus. It then runs along the outer side of the os calcis in a sheath of fascia in front of the lono- tendon and peroneal tubercle, and is inserted into the most prominent part of the tuberosity at the base of the fifth metatarsal bone. ■ . .-L The peronei act as plantar flexors of the foot, i.e., they pomt the toes. Both muscles, birt especially the peroneus longus, abduct the foot at the talo-calcaneo-scaphoid joint, and the peroneus longus ni addition fonns an important diagonal tie for the longitudinal arch of the foot. Both are supplied by the musculo-cutaneous nerve. The synovial membrane under the annular Ugament is common to the two peronei, but it divides into two parts as the tendons approach the peroneal tubercle of the calcaneum. The External Popliteal Nerve (Fig. 86, i) is to be followed along the inner border of the biceps tendon into the fibres of the peroneus longus, to which point it was ti-aced in the dissection of the popliteal space. It gives off an externa paieUar cutaneous branch to the outer side of the knee-joint before entering the muscle, and afterwards a recurrent articular branch, which pierces the extensor longus digitorum to reach the upper part of the tibiahs anticus and the fi'ont of the knee. In then divides into anter.or tibial U), and musculo-cutaneous (3) nerves. The Musculo-cutaneous Nerve gives branches to the peroneus longus and peroneus brevis, and then appears between the peroneus longus and extensor longus digitorum, finally becoming cutaneous by piercing the fascia in the lower third of the leg. [The tendons on the back of the foot ai;e to be divided or held aside, and the transversus pedis in the sole is to be removed t.. permit a clear view of all the mterossei.] Beneath the transversus pedis will be found the plantar transrcr.^^ liaament of the metatarsus, from which its fibres arise, and over which the'digital vessels and nerves pass. It connects the heart, of the metatarsal bones together, and crosses beneath (on tJio plantar side of) the tendons of the iiiterossei muscles. The dorsal transverse ligaments, much weaker than the last, jom the dorsal aspect of the heads of the metatarsal bones, and between the twoTHK INTEROSSEOUS MUSCLES. 179 ligaments pass the tendons of the interossei as in the hand (see p.^79). The Interosseous Muscles are seven in number, viz., four dorsal and three plantar, the former being between the bones, while the latter He rather on theii- under surfaces. The dorsal are bipenni- form muscles, and are seen on both surfaces of the foot; the plantar ai-e seen only on the sole. The four dorsal interossei (Fig. 87) arise from the adjacent sides of the metatarsal bones in nearly the whole length of their shafts, Fig. 87. 88. and are inserted into the bases of the first ],halangoH in such a Planner as to abduct from an imaginary lino prolonged through the second metatar.sal bone (instead of the third as in the hnnd) and into the exten.sor tendon over the proximal phalanx Thus the 1st IS m.sertedinto theside of the first phalanx of the Becond_toe^ the oiUer side of the first phalanx of the >'ig. 87.—The dorsal interosHeous muscles of the foot r,T T f!™ v\ Tl,o « refer to the seven synovial n,embnuuls.

They thus act as adductors towards the second toe. The principal uses of both dorsal and plantar mterossei are however, as in the hand, to flex the proximal and extend the middle and ungual phalanges. They are supj^led hj the deep branch of the external plantar nerve, except those m the foui-th space, which receive a branch from the superficial part of the nerve. The Knee-Joint. The knee is an example of a modified gingljmius or hinge-joint. The hinge movement between the femur and the tibia takes place around a shifting transverse axis through the femoral condyle, and is complicated, at the end of extension and at the ^eg-- flexion, by a slight rotation around a vertical axis passing through thJmildle of the outer facet of the tibia. During Aexion, the relaxation of the ligaments permits also movements of pronation and supination of the leg around a vertical axis passing through the inner tubercle of the tibial spine. Its synovial membrane .s the most extensive in the body. The knee-joint has in front the patella and l^g;--^;-\i;f with the expansion of the extensor muscles and the fascial band.

The ligaments of the knee may conveniently be divided into extra- and intra-articular. The Extra-articular Ligaments are posterior and lateral. The Anterior Ligaments (Fig. 89) are represented by th.e pateUa and the lii/anieidiimpatellce. in the middle, with the expansions of the vasti and the patellar ligaments on either side. The external patellar lUjami'rit is a process of the ilio-tibial band attached to the outer border of the bone below the vastus externus and to the ligamentum pateUte, while the internal patellar lif/ament, derived from the internal intermuscular septum and inner tuberos'ty of the femiu', is similarly connected on the inner side. Some deep supplementary fibres may also pass from the tuberosities of tbe tibia to either side of the patella, and it should be noted that the patellar attachment of the vastus internus extends lower than that of the vastus externus. Between the ligamentum patellfB and the upper part of the tubercle of the tibia is a bursa {bursa sah-patellaris), wbich must not be confounded with the proper barsa patellai in front of the bone. [To see the remaining external ligaments, the pojditeal vessels and nerves and the remains of the gastrocnemius and plautaris must be removed. The tendons of the biceps, semi-membranosus and popliteus are to be traced out fully, and should be carefully pre- served, but cut short. The internal lateral ligament will be" found to be incorporated with the capsule, the external is beneath the tendon of the biceps and external patellar ligament, and is not seen until these have been divided.] The Posterior Ligament (Fig. 90, 8) (ligament\im posticum Winslowii) is a flat band, attached above the condjdes of the femur and to the back of the head of the tibia; it is closely connected with the tendon of the semi-membranosus, from which a large band of fibres passes obliquely upwards and outwards across the back of the joint (13), and on the outer side it receives a slip from the short external lateral ligament. It is extremely thin beneath the heads of the gasti'ocnemius, and is frequently ]ierforated where the inner head of this muscle and the semi-membranosus tendon are separated from the back of the internal condyle by a bursa, which in that case conimimicates with the cavity of the -joint. The External Lateral Ligaments (Figs. 89, 5 ; 90, 2) are two iii number, the A,/,,/ and shnrl. th.. l„ng being tlu^ anterior one of the two. The hnnj li,;,nnr„l. is ;i round cord extending from the margin of the gastrocnrmius impression u])on the side of the external condyle, immediately al)ovc the ])osterior extremity of the depression for the popliteus, to the middle of the bicipital182 THE KNEE-JOINT. tuberosity on tbe outer side of tbe head of the fibula, between the divisions of the biceps tendon and above the peroneus lonj^us origin. The tendon of the popliteus and the external inferior ai-ticular arbery pass beneath it. The short ligamad is placed behind the long, and reaches from the condyle to the styloid process of the fibula, blending with the outer part of the posterior ligament above; and is connected by means of a curved band (ligamentum popliteum arcuatum), which passes from the middle of its inner border to the posterior ligament, and to the tendon of the popliteus. Above this lies the popliteal aperture in the capsule. The Internal Lateral Ligament (Figs. 89, 6 ; 90, i) is a strong baud closely connected with the internal patellar ligament and internal semilunar cartilage. It is attached to the most prominent part of the ijmer tuberosity of the femur above, and is m more or less direct continuity with'the tendon of the adductor magnus at the adductor tubercle. It expands as it descends, and may be divided into two portions, anterior and posterior, the posterior attached to the inner tixberosity of the tibia, and covering in the tendon o'f the semi-membranosus; while the anterior segment, also fixed to the tuberosity, is continued on to the upper part of the inner surface of the shaft of the tibia, leaving an interval through which pass the inferior internal articular vessels of the knee. . The posterior and lateral ligaments aid the crucial ligaments in limiting extension. The lateral Ugaments in addition check the movement of supination (external rotation) of the leg which is per- mitted during flexion of the knee. The capsule of the joint is deficient where the tendon of the popliteus passes downwards over the articular borders of the femm' and tibia and the mtervenmg external semilunar cartilage, and here a pouch of synovial mem- brane is prolonged around the tendon. An occasional opeumg beneath the inner head of the gastrocnemius has already been referred to. There is no 'capsular Hgament' distinct from the ■structure,s described, unless the name be conferred upon the irregular bands which strengthen the synovial membrane at the antero-lateral parts of the joint. [The tendon of the rectus is to be divided and drawn down m order to see the extent of the synovial membrane above the patella, since it usually reaches for a couple of inches above the articular surface of tlio' femur and gives attachment to tho Snhmn-ms. a small muschi arising from the lower part of the anteru.r ^^r ace ot the femur.

The synovial membrane is then to be divided on each side, as near the condyles as possible, and the patella turned down, when the Hganicntum mucosum and the ligamenta alaria will be seen.] The liigamentum Mucosum (Fig. 91, 5) is a pyramidal reflection of synovial membrane attached by its apex to a depression in the notch between the condyles, immediately behind the articular sui-face. From this point it expands, enclosing a large quantity of fat which lies against the back of the lower angle of the patella, the ligamentum patellsB and the lateral patellar ligaments. The Ligamenta Alaria are merely two fringes of synovial membrane appended, one on each side, to the ligamentum mucosum, and running upwards as far as the lateral border of the patella. [The lioumentum mucosum is to be divided and the patella turned down completely, when the bursa of the ligamentum patella? can be opened and seen. The capsular and posterior ligaments are to be removed, but the lateral ligaments are to be preserved and the ol^icial ligaments dissected.] The Intra-articular Ligaments are the two crucial and the transverse ligaments. Within the joint also are two semilunar cartilages which are partly ligamentous. The Crucial Ligaments are two powerful bands extending from the upper inter-articular sui-face of the tibia to the two sides of the inter-condyloid notch of the femur, and invested by a prolongation of synovial membrane. _ The Anterior Crucial Ligament (Fig. 91, 2) is attached above to the inner and back part of the external condyle of the femiu', and passes obliquely downwards, forwards, and inwards across the joint, to be inserted into the triangular space on the top of the tibia in front of the spine, between the anterior atfaichments of the internal and external semilunar cartilages. It receives a slip from the external semilunar cartilage. . , , , The Posterior Crucial Ligament (Fig. 91, 3) is broader and stouter than the anterior. It is attached to the anterior and outer part of the internal condyle, and passes downwards, backwards, anil sHghtly inwards, to the top of the tibia between the articular facets and behind the spine, and to the popliteal notch. It receives two slips from the posterior extremity of the internal semilunar cartilage, and is closely connected with the anterior crucial ligament at the point of decussation. . ^ i 4-- The crucial ligaments check extension and resist dislo«ition ni all directions. The anterior ligament also limits the movement of185 THE SEMILUNAR CARTILAGES. Fig. 91. ]iiMiiiitiou (internal rotation) of the leg wliich is permitted during flexion of the knee. If the lateral ligaments are now divided, it will be fonnd that the femur and tibia become more separated than before, showing that the object of the crucial ligaments is not simply to maintaia the articular sm-faces in apposition. It will also be seen that whilst rotation of the tibia outwards can now be carried to an exti-eme degree (so as to bring the crucial ligaments almost ■parallel), rotation inwards is immediately- checked by the tension of the anterior liga- ment, and it is thus that the tendency of the popliteus muscle to rotate the leg inwards is counterbalanced. The Transverse Ligament (Fig. 91, 4) is a small band connecting the anterior extremities of the two semilunar cartilages, and often not distinct. The Semilunar Cartilages (Fig. 91, 6, 7), which can be partly seen now, but will be full exposed by divicUng the crucial ligaments, are two fibro-cartilages interposed between the tibia and femur. They are triangular on section and present each two free siu-faces, superior and inferior, turned towards the femru- and tibia respectively; and an outer attached surface or base connected with the inner aspect of the capsule, and following the curvature of the outer border of the corresponding tuberosity of the tibia. They are fixed to the tibia partly by marginal fibres (coronary ligaments), derived from the capsule, partly by the direct attachment of their fibrous extremities to impressions in front of and behind the tibial spine • and are also connected to the intercondylar notch of the femur by fabrous bands, which join the crucial ligaments. They serve to deepen the tibial facets, and at the same time to form for each Fig, 91.-The right knee-joint laid open from the front, and dissected to show tlie interniil ligaments (from Wilson). 1.

[The whole of the muscular fibres connected with the bones of the leg and foot must be removed, but the tendinous insertions about the foot should be kept to be examined with the ligaments.] The Superior tibio-fibular articulation (Fig. DO) is a simple ai-throdial joint, the synovial membrane of which is occasionally continuous with that of the knee through the medium of the popliteal bursa. The anterior and posterior (lo) ligaments are short bands connecting the anterior and posterior sm-faces of the head of the fibula with the outer tuberosity of the tibia, and forming a cai)sule. The joint is strengthened by the tendon of the biceps. Thf. Middle tibio-fibular articulation is formed by the iulerosseuus 'W<>w''''l' Of membrane, and is the great bond betwoon the .shafts of he bones of the leg. Its fibres run downwards from the tibia, to the hbula, and are attached to the sharp interosseous borders of188 TIBIO-FIBULA.ll ARTICULATIONS. both bones. It is pierced above by the anterior tibial vessels, and near its lower part by the anterior peroneal vessels.

A fold of synovial membrane is often prolonged for a very short distance between the two bones from the ankle-joint. Ankle-Joint and Articulations of the Foot. The ankle-joint is almost a pure ginglymus, moving 15° (from the position of station), in the direction of dorsal flexion, and 45° in that of plantar flexion. It has in f ront from within outwards the Fig. 93. tendons of the tibialis anticus and extensor propriiis hallucis, the anterior tibial vessels and nerve, the extensor longus digitormn, and the peroneus tertius. Fixing these structures in place is the anterior annular ligament, and more superficially lies the musculo- cutaneous nerve breaking up into its internal and external branches. Jle/rind, arranged from within outwards are the tendons of the tibialis po.sticus and flexor digitonim longus, the posterior tibial vessels and nerve (or it mny be the plantar vessels and nerves), Fig. 93.—Vertical section of anlde-joint (after Henle). 1.

The ankle- joint has anterior, posterior, and two lateral ligaments. The Anterior Ligament is a broad thin membrane which is seldom seen entire. It is attached to the lower margin of the tibia, and to the superior surface of the astragalus close to its head, and joins the lateral ligament on each side. The Posterior Ligament is not described by many author.-?, d it is seldom represented by more than a few fibres stretching an Fig. 94, over the synovial membrane between the back of the tibia and the astragalus. . The Internal Lateral Ligament (Fig. 9-4, i. 2, 3, 4} is triangular in shape, and hence has been called di-ltouh The apex is attached to the tip and borders of the internal malleolus, and the base to the posterior part of the astragalus, the lesser process ot the OS calcis, the inferior calcaneo-scaphoid ligament, and the tuberosity of the scaphoid bone. A strong derp portion passes from the apex of the malleolus to the side of the astragalus.

The posterior (Fig. 92, 12) is placed between the posteiior parts of the two bones, close to the groove in the astragalus through which the tendon of the flexor longus hallucis passes. The irder- ossenus (Fig. 93, 5) ligament will be seen when the joint is opened. It is a strong thick band, passing from the groove between the two inferior articular siu'faces of the astragalus, to the corresponding o-roove between the two articular surfaces on the superior aspect of the calcaneum; it divides the sub-astragalar synovial cavity into ■ two parts, an anterior continuous with the astragalo-scaphoid pint, and a posterior directly beneath the ankle-joint. The double articulation, to which the name talo-mhaneo-scaiM jomt may be given, is the seat of nearly the whole of the lateral motion (abduction and adduction) of the foot (Fig. 97). . The tendon of the tibialis posticus may now be seen crossmg the deltoid ligament, and will be found to have a fibro-cartilage developed in it where it passes under the head of the astragalus and remforces the inferior calcaneo-scaphoid ligament. It is attached to the tuberosity of the scaphoid bone and the adjacent internal crmei- form bone, and gives slips also to all the other bones 0 the.tarsus with the exception of the astragalus, and to the second, th^d, and fourth metatarsal bones. These must be removed to see the ti'ue ligaments of the joints. 4. t ^x,^ Ligaments of the Tarsus.-On the dorsal aspect of the remahiing tarsal bones will be found a number of short bands of fitees, wWch pass between adjacent bones and have received nam . as ligaments accordingly, on the plantar aspect there are smrilar hnttZLv ligaments, three of which are worthy of special notice. v"z the lono. and short calcaneo-cuboid ligaments, and the calcaneo- TanW ligaments Another set of ligaments, called n.terosseo.s. :Zl:uL'o;pUlatei.lsru-face^ facets are deficient (Fi8^ 97), undwdl be seen late.

The Synovial Membranes (Fig. 97) of the foot, including the ankle-joint, are seven in number, and will be seen hj oj^ening the several joints in succession. The 1st is the synovial membrane of the ankle (i), reflected over the inner surface of ligaments of the joint, and may pass also for a short distance between the tibia and hbulu into the inferior tibio- nbular articulation.

The -Ith synovial membrane (iv) belongs to the calcaneo-cuboid articulation, and when it is opened, the pecuUar manner m which the two bones are locked together will be seen. The oth synovial membrane (y) is common to the scapho- cuneiform, inter-cuneiform, and cubo-cuneiiorm articulations and to^he oints between the middle and external cuneifoj-m and the con-esponding metatarsal bones (vii), and is also prolonged into Te Sulations between the second, thii-d, and fourth metatarsal ^'Tteross'eous Hgaments wiU be found between the scaphoid and cuW bones; between the internal and middle cuneifonn bones between the middle and external cuneiform bones ; and between the external cuneiform and cuboid bones. .

It is here that nearly the whole of the ' abduction ' and ' addnction ' of the anterior part of the foot takes place, and it may be noted that the ankle-joint takes no part in these lateral motions, even dming plantar flexion. Strictly speaking, the movement is one of adduction with elevation of the inner border of the foot, and the abduction is merely restitution to the original position. The foot is adduded chiefly by the tibialis anticus, tibialis posticus, and flexor longus digitoi'um, and abducted by the peronei. The articulations between the metatarsal bones and the phalanges, and between the phalanges themselves, are similar to those in the hand. They are, however, on a smaller scale, and therefore more difficult of dissection, except in the case of the great toe, where the articular elements are well defined. Physiologically the great toe differs from the thumb in its adaptation to sustain the greater part of the weight of the body in walking, and in its incapability of opposition to the other toes.« |gt>OMC5 fa O' <D CD •?

[The perinreum is to be ftiUy exposed by bringing the buttocks of the subject to the edge of the table, where they are to be raised upon a block. The thighs are then to be flexed upon the abdomen, with the legs bent; and the body is to be secured upon the table with a cord passing beneath it from one knee to the other, a block being placed lengthways between the knees to keep them sufficiently apart. A staff is to be passed into the male urethra, and seciu'ed in its place by tying a loop of string round the penis and fastening it to the handle of the instrument. It is necessary to flex the knees, when the thighs are bent, in order to remove the tension that would otherwise occur in the hamsti-ings and sciatic nerve.] External Appearances.—/?(. the male the skin is of a darker tint than that of the rest of the body, and is more or less covered with hair, which should be removed. In fi-ont will be foimd the scrotum, containing the two testes, and obscuring at present the root of the penis and deeper portion of the urethra. Behind the scrotum is the anus or orifice of the bowel, and between the two is the true perinceum, which will be seen to be marked by a median raphe. Around the anus the skin is thrown into folds, which may be much enlarged in one variety of external piles. By drawing the anus open, a white line will be seen about half an inch above the margin of the aperture, marking the junction of the skin with the mucous membrane, and corresponding to the separation between the internal and external sphincter muscles. In the female the external parts of generation are tenned collec- tively the vulva. They comprise two labia niajora, two labia minora or nymphaj, the clitoris, and the vestibule. The two labia mujora may be considered to represent the scrotum, cleft in the median Ime by the genital fissure. These are continuous above with the mona Veneris, a prominent portion of the fat-bearing integument over the pubes (only partially seen in this view) The labia are united in front by the anterior commissure; they bound204 THE PERIN^.UM. the rhm (jmiialis and are continued backwards to the posterior boundary of the perinEBum, where they are united by the imdi-rmr commissure. In a female who has not borne children, a small trans- verse fold of mucous membrane may be seen just within the pos- terior commissui-e, which is called the fourchdte, and between the two is the fossa mivicul.aris. By separating the labia the clitoris will be seen at the upper part of the vulva, resembling a diminutive penis in appearance and structirre, but having only a small and ill-defined <ikms and j^rftpMC", and no urethral perforation. The mjmphce or hihia minora extend obliquely downwards ti-om each side of the cUtoris, being connected both with the organ itself and its prepuce, and are lost in the labia majora about midway between the anterior and posterior commissures. _ The vestihule is a triangular interval, with the apex at the clitons and the base at the orifice of the vagina, the sides being formed by the nymphte. An inch below the clitoris is the mmtus urnuinus, the margin of which is slightly prominent, and is placed unmediately above the orifice of the vagina. , •, ■, . The entrance of the vagina may be more or less occluded by a hymen, which is a, reduplication of mucous membrane, usually ot a crescentic form with the concave border upwards The caruncm^ myrtiformes are Httle projections fi-om the vaginal wall left by the rupture of the hymen. On each side of the vagina, midway between its anterior and posterior waUs, immediately in fi-on of the hymen or its remains, are the orifices of the v^dvo-vagimd glands (or g ands of Bartholin). The orifices of numerous sebaceous foUicles will also be found scattered over the vulva. j „ The tissues separating the lower ends of the vagina and rectum are known as the 2>er/.cm/ hody, and sometimes under the lU-selec ed term of perineum. The base of the perinteal body, formed by the integument intervening between the posterior commissure of the labif and -the anal orifice, is from an mch to an mch and a hal long, but becomes greatly stretched during labour. The hngei shotud be introduced into the vagina to ascertam the position and concHtion of the cervix and os uteri. Boundaries of the Perin^um.-These are he - sexes, and can be best ascertained by placmg a pelvis, o^.^^^i*^!^ ^he ligaments are preserved, in the same position as the «^^b^ect, when the space under examination will be seen to correspond wi h th^^ nferior aperture of the pelvis. In front is ^^^^ ff .^^^j with the divergent ischio-pubic rami extending to the tuberosities of The ischia, which fonn the lateral boundaries. Posteriorly are the205 THE PERIN/EUM. inferior borders of the great sacro-sciatic ligaments, in the recent subject overlapped by the margins of the glutei maximi; and foiming the posterior mesial limit of the space is the extremity of the coccj^. The perinseum has been generally considered to resemble the heraldic lozenge, bat has more aptly been compared to an inverted ace-of-hearts. The inferior aperture of the pelvis is larger in the female than in the male, but considerable variation in the spa.ce between the rami of the pubes •will be found in different individuals. As a rule the subpubic angle is one of 90*^ or more in the female, but is less than a right angle ia the male. The perinseal space may be conveniently divided into halves, by a line passing fi-om the anterior border of one tuberosity of the ischium to the other; the anterior or ui'ethral half, the perinceain pro2xr, contains the uruio-genital organs, and the posterior half, or ischio- rectal rtgivn, the lower extremity of the bowel and the ischio-rectal fossEe. It will be seen, however, that this arbitrary line does not coincide exactly with the true anatomical Limits between the two segments of the perinseal structiu'es. PosTEEioE Space in both Sexes. [A little cotton-wool is to be iutroduced into the rectiun, and the anus is to be carefully sewn up, the stitches being placed as near the white line mentioned above as possible. A transverse incision is then to be made in front of the anus, connecting the two tuber- osities, and a similar one across the lower extremity of the coccyx. These are to be joined by a vertical median incision, which at the anus spHts into two parts to surround that orifice, close to the sutui-es, and the skin is to be reflected on each side.] The integument surrounding the anus is pigmented and beset with hairs and large sebaceous follicles. It moreover possesses scattered bundles of smooth muscular fibre (coiTugator cutis ani) continuous with the dartos of the scrotum and periuEeimi; and small furrows which radiate from the anal aperture. The veins in this region are very liable to varicose dilatation. The External Sphincter Ani (Fig. 99, i6) siuTounds the anua and lies close beneath the skin. It consists of two symmetrical halves, which are attached to the tip of the coccyx behind, and meet about an inch in front of the anus at the tendinous centre of tho perinreum; some fibres encircling the anus without attachment to bone. The muscle closes the lower end of the bowel, and is supplied by the inferior hcBmoiThoidal nerve and by a branch of the fom-th sacral nerve.206 THE PERINiEUM. The Tendinous Centre of the Perineeum is the name applied to a spot in front of the auus, corresponding to the point of meeting of the sphincter ani with the bulbo-cavernosi and transversi perimei muscles. The Internal Sphincter cannot he seen at present. It is merely a thickened band of the unstriped circular fibres of the rectum, and differs therefore in structure from the external sphincter, which is a voluntaiy muscle. It lies above the latter. [The edge of the gluteus maximus is now to be defined, since it forms the boundary of the dissection; it will be found extendmg obliquely upwards and outwards (in this position) fi'om the tip of the coccyx. The fat filling the interspace between the anus and the edge of the muscle (iscHo-rectal fossa) is to be carefuUy removed piecemeal, care being taken to preserve the inferior haemorrhoidal vessels and nerve, which run transversely towards the bowel, and also a Httle branch of the foui'th sacral nerve near the posterior pai-t of the space, as weU as the small sciatic nerve and vessels which escape imder cover of the muscle. Other branches of the pudic vessels and nerve maybe seen runmng forwards towards the scrotum, and should be avoided.] The Ischio-reotal Fossa (Fig. 99) is the space on each side of the rectum, bounded superficiaUy by the gluteus maximus, ischial tuberosity, and great sacro-sciatic ligament behind; by the jimction of the fascia of Colles with the triangular ligament in fi-ont, and by the sphincter ani internally. Its deep boundaries are, on the i>n,a- side the levator ani and coccygeus, and on the outer side the obturator internus Ijdng on the internal sui^face of the wall of the pelvis. Both these muscles are covered by processes derived from the pelvic fascia; that covering the obtiu-ator internus being caUed the obtarato,- fascia, and that upon the levator ani being the anal fasaa {see diagram of pelvic fascia). When the finger is pushed into this space, it is arrested by the junction of these two fasci^ above, m front, and behind. Superiorly it extends to a depth of from two to three inches, while anteriorly it may be traced forward nearly as far as the symphysis, above the ledge of tissues constituting the perineeum proper; and posteriorly it nms for some distance over the sacro-sciatic ligaments to the coccyx. The fossa then is pyi-amidal in frontal section, anvil-shaped in sagittal section. The space is fiUed with loose granular fat, which is traversed by the inferior hemorrhoidal vessels and nerve. On the outer side, and lying above the inner border of the ischial tuberosity and the falciform process of the gi-eat sacro-sciatic hgament, are found the pudic vessels and nerve giving off hsemorrhoidal and peruiseal207 THE LEVATOR ANl MUSCLE. branches, and lying in a fibrous channel (canal of Alcock) formed by the obtiirator fascia. It is here that the artery can be effectu- ally compressed in cases of haemorrhage. The perinseal branches of the pudic artery and nerve leave the main trunks in the anterior part of the ischio-rectal fossa, but will be better seen afterwards. The Levator Ani Muscle {Fig. 99, i8) arises within the pelvis.

It is now seen at its insertion into the side of the lower part of the rectum, and behind this into the central line of the perinseiun (where it meets its fellow of the opposite side in a median raphe), and into the anterior surface of the extremity of the coccyx. Its free anterior border runs by the side of the prostate; its posterior border is opposed to the anterior margin of the coccygeus. It is covered on its upper surface by the recto-vesical fascia, and on its lower surface by the ischio-rectal or anal fascia, which is derived from the inner sui-face of the obturator fascia. The levator ani supports the abdomino-pelvic viscera, and, when in couti-action, helps to compress them, and so takes a part in the expiilsion of their contents. It is also an extraordinary muscle of expiration, since it assists in forcing the viscera into the concavity of the diaphragm; and it may compress the prostatic veins, and so conduce to the erection of the penis and the expulsion of the prostatic secretion. It is doubtful whether it has any dii'ect influence upon the anal aperture either as a dilator or constrictor. It is supplied by the fourth sacral nerve. The Inferior Hsemorrhoidal Artery (Eig. 99, 13) arises fi-om the internal pudic artery under cover of the ischium, pierces the canal of Alcock, and takes a nearly transverse coui-se inwards to the anus and lower end of the rectum, where it anastomoses with the middle htemorrhoidal branch of the internal iliac and the superior heemorrhoidal branch of the inferior mesenteric. Ventt comitcs run with the artery, and join the pudic vein. The Inferior Hsemorrhoidal Nerve (Fig. 99, 13) is a branch of the internal pudic nerve, taking the same coui-se as the pudic nerve in the same sheath of fascia. In the ischio-rectal fossa it runs transversely, superficial to the inferior hsemorrhoidal vessels, and is distributed to the external sphincter and skin of the anus, giving a branch forward to join the superficial pemiteal nerves.

It ajipears at the side of the coccyx after piercing the coccygeus muscle, and is distributed to the external sphincter. A iHrforatimi cntanenv8 branch of the sacral plexus, which has passed through the gi-eat sacro-sciatic hgament, is usually found winding round the edge of the gluteus maximus from the ischio- rectal fossa. Anterior Space m the Male. [The scrotum being drawn up with hooks, an incision is to be made in the median line, extending from the central point of the perinreum to within three inches of the extremity of the penis. The skin is to be reflected to each side, and the testicles held out of the way with hooks.] The Superficial Fascia of the anterior half of the perinEeum is chvisible into two layers—superficial and deep. The siq^trficial layer of superficial fascia is continuous with that of the scrotum, and Like the latter is fatless and contains a layer of involmitary muscular fibre, the durtos. The deep layer of superficial fascia (Fig. 99, 6), or Fascia of Colles, is brought into view by the removal of the superficial layer as a distinct membrane in thin subjects, but is not easily defined in fat ones. It is continuous in fi-ont with the fascia of the scrotum and penis, and over the root of the penis with the fascia of the abdomen; laterally it is attached on each side to the margin of the ischio- pubic rami as far back as the tuberosity ; and posteriorly turns around the transversi perinfei muscles, and joins the posterior boi-der of the deep perinaeal fascia or triangular ligament. A pouch, which may be called the superficial picrinmd interspace, is thus foi-med between the fascia of Colles and the triangular lio'a- ment, and encloses the root of the penis (the bidb of the corpus spongiosum and the crura of the corpora cavernosa) with its surrounding muscles, vessels, and nerves. It is subdivided into two lateral halves posteriorly, by a median septum of fascia re.nching from the deep surface of the fascia of Colles to the subjacent bulbo-cavernosus muscle, but this septum disappears anteriorly. This interspace is of importance surgically with regard to extra- vasation of lu-ine. If extravasation should occur from rupture of the bulbous or adjacent portion of the urethra, either from external violence or from the unskilful use of a catheter or other cause the urine is effused into the pouch, and, being prevented by the union oi^the two fascia) posteriorly from running back to the anus, and V210 THE PERINEUM. by theii- lateral attacliinent to the rami of the pubes and ischium from extending on to the thighs, it necessarily distends the pouch, and creeps into the scrotum and groiii and on to the abdomen. [The deep layer of superficial fascia is to be removed, and the superficial perinteal vessels and nerves dissected out; care bemg taken to preserve the superficial transverse muscle, which runs outwards from the central point of the perinseum.] The Superficial Perinaeal Artery (Fig. 99, 5) is a branch of the internal pudic, and arises under cover of the ramus of the ischium near the front of the ischio-rectal fossa. It enters the superficial perinteal pouch of fascia by piercing its hinder boi-der, and then passes forwards, over or under the superficial transversus perinfei muscle, to supply the superficial muscles of the perinseum and the integuments of the scrotum, and anastomose with the external pudic arteries. It usuaUy gives off the transverse permmal artery, which runs towards the median line close to the supei-ficial transverse muscle, and anastomoses with the opposite arteiy and with the neighbouring branches. Veins corresponding to the superficial perimeal artery open into the internal pudic vem. The Perinaeal Nerve (Fig. 99) generaUy leaves the pudic as a single large trunk in the lesser sacro-sciatic foramen, and supphes two superficial perioueal nerves; muscular branches to the thi-ee muscles in the corresponding half of the superficial perinseal mter- space (transversus perinsei, ischio-cavernosus and bulbo-cavernosus); and a branch which may be followed thi-ough the accelerator imna? to the bulb of the Mvethvei{hulbo-nrethral nerve of CruveOhier). The external or posterior superficial perineal (3) nerve has a short course m the ischio-rectal fossa, where it gives a branch to the anus. It then pierces the reflection of the deep layer of supei-ficial fascia, and gives branches to the scrotum, forming a junction with the inferior pudendal nerve and posteriorly with the inferior hremor- rhoidal nerve. . . The internal or anterior {j) nerve accompanies the superfacial perinfeal artery either over or under the transversus perinnei muscle, and is distributed to the scrotum near the median line, where it unites with its fellow of the opposite side, giving also one or two small branches to the levator ani. The before-named muscular and ^^rethral twigs may spring fi-om this branch instead of from the perinreal trunk. . . The Inferior Pudendal Nerve (Fig. 99, i) (Soemmenng) is a branch of the smaU sciatic nerve, which pierces the deep fascia of the thigh about an inch in front of the tuberosity of the ischium.MUSCLES OF THE PERTN/EUM. 211 It varies a good deal in size and distribution, but generally runs inwards beneath the fascia of OoUes to the scrotum and joins the external superficial perinreal nerve. [The supei-ficial vessels and nerves are to be tm-ned aside, and the muscles dissected out. The accelerator urinse is in the median line, the erector penis parallel to the ramus of the pubes, and the transversus perinsei crosses between them posteriorly; the muscles thus boiuiding a triangular space in which a part of the triangular ligament is seen.] Superficial Muscles of the Perinaeum. The muscles in the superficial perinseal interspace are invested, each by a fascia proper to itself. The Bulbo-cavernosus (Fig. 99, 8) [ejaculator semim's or accele- rator urince) is a single muscle, composed of two symmetrical halves united in the middle line by a delicate fibrous raphe. The fibres arise from the central point of the perinteum and from the fibrous raphe superficial to the bulb, and are inserted as follows:—the posterior fibres, which are nearly transverse in their dii-ection, overlie the bulb and are lost upon the superficial layer of the triangular ligament; the middle fibres encircle the coi-pus spon- giosum and meet those of the opposite side in a median raphe under cover of the corpora cavernosa; and the anterior fibres (inconstant) pass obliquely outwards and forwards, enclosing the entire circumference of the root of the penis and the dorsal vessels {compressor vence dorsalis). The IscMo-cavernosus (Fig. 99, lo) {erector penis), a paired muscle, covers the crus penis. It arises fi-om the anterior and inner surface of the tuberosity of the ischium, from the ramus of the ischium and also from the fibrous origin of the crus; and ends in an aponem-osis which is inserted into the sides of the crus penis, sometimes sending a slip over the dorsal vessels. The Transversus Perinaei (Fig. 99, 14), also a paired muscle, is veiy variable in its character. It arises from the inner side of the ramus of the ischium, and running forwards and inwards meets its fellow muscle of the opposite side in the central point of the perina3um, where it often blends with the fibres of the accelerator urinEG and sphincter ani. The action of the bulho-care.rnosiis is to expel the contents of the urethra by its sudden and spasmodic contraction. It is not put in action during the greater part of the act of micturition ; but when the ftow of mine has ceased, it serves to eject the small remaining portion; or it may be used to arrest the flow of urine suddenly^ when its action gives rise to considerable pain.

It may be well to leave the crus penis undisturbed on the right side.] The posterior part of the Corpus Spongiosum XJrethxae will be seen to be a dark, vascular body, which expands to form the bulb, immediately in front of the triangular ligament. The Bulb (Fig. 102, 6) is slightly expanded fi-om side to side, and consists of two halves united by a delicate septum of fibrous tissue. It is closely connected above with the triangular liga- ment, with which its delicate fibrous covering is continuous, and is embraced by the two halves of the bulbo-cavernosus muscle. The Superficial Layer of tlie Triangular Ligament or Deep Perinasal Fascia (Fig. 102, 8) is a strong proces.s of fibrous tissue stretching across the pubic arch, being attached to the rami of the OS pubis and ischium on each side, behind the crura penis. It is almost horizontal in the erect posture. The apex of the ligament is separated from the sub-pubic liga- ment by an apertm-e for the dorsal vein of the penis; and the base, which has the form of an inverted V with the angle at the tendinous centre of the perincBum, is continuous with the fascia of CoUes where this tm-ns around the superficial transversi periuEei. and also vnth. the base of the deep layer of the triangular Hgament.

The contents are the deep transversus perinsei (compressor urethras); the membranous portion of the urethi-a; Cowper's glands; portions of the pudic vessels and dorsal nerve of the penis, and the artery to the bulb. The sub-pnbic ligament and dorsal vein of the penis lie at the anterior angle or apex of the interspace. The Deep Transversus Perinsei or Compressor TJrethi-ae (Pig. 102, g) arises from the inner surface of the ischio-pubic rami, between the attachments of the ti-iangular ligament and fi-om both layers of that ligament, and divides into anterior and posterior slips, which run inwards transversely across the median line to enclose the membranous portion of the lu-ethra. Within the fibres of the compressor on each side are (1) Cowper's gland, (2) the pudic artery, giving off the artery to the bulb, and di^ddiiig into the artery to the corpus cavernosum and the dorsal artery of the perns, (3) tlie corresponding veins, and (4) the dorsal nerve of the penis, a branch of which supplies the muscle. The duct of Cowiier's gland and the other structures named have been seen to pierce the superficial layer of the triangular ligament to reach the supei-ficial pouch. [The muscular fibres are to be divided near the ui-ethi-a in order to see one of .Cowper's glands, and the pudic artery and nerve with their branches are to be followed out close to the ischio-pubic rami.J Cowper's Glands (Fig. 103, E) lie close to the membranous portion of the ui-ethi'a, one on each side of the median line, and are most readily found by tracing the small branch of supply to each gland from the artery to the bulb. The gland resembles a pea in size and shape, and consists of numerous minute lobules. Although it is so close to the membranous lU'ethi-a, the duct pierces the superficial layer of the triangular Hgament to open into the bulbous portion of the canal, and is nearly an inch long. The Pudic Artery (Fig. 107, g), one of the two tei-mmal branches of the anterior cUvision of the internal iliac, will be found under cover of the pubic arch. After running in Alcock's cau=il (p. 206) in the outer wall of the ischio-rectal fossa, and giving ott its inferior ha3morrhoidal and superficial permaial branches, it pierces the deep layer of the triangular ligament near its b^e to enter the deep perinatal interspace. Here it runs in the fibres of the compressor urethras, close to the ischio-pubic rami, and gives off the arteries to the bulb and corpus cavernosum, and tei-minates in the dorsal artery of the penis.DORSAL ARTERY OF THE PENIS. 217 The Artery to the Bulb (Fig. 102, 7) passes transversely in- wards to suijply the bulb, to reach which it has to pierce the suiierficial layer of the triangular ligament close to the middle lino. It generally gives a branch to Oowjjer's gland of the same side. The Artery to the Corpus Cavernosum (Fig. 107, 14) pierces Fig. 107. the superficial layer of the triangular ligament to enter the cms. It is accompanied by a vein. The Dorsal Artery of the Penis pierces the fore part of the superficial layer of the triangular ligament, and then the suspen- sory Kgament, to reach the upper sui-face of the organ, where it will be subsequently traced. When the pudic artery is small, the dorsal arteries are derived from the trunks of the internal iliacs, and reach the penis by Fig. 107.—Arteries of the perinteum superficial arteries are 1.

The Dorsal Vein of the Penis runs between the sub-pubic and triangular ligaments to join the prostatic plexus of veins. The Internal Pudic Vein receives tributaries corresponding to the branches of the pudic artery, with the exception of the dorsaUs penis vein, and terminates in the internal iliac vem. The Pudic Nerve (Fig. 102, 3) lies below the artery in the ischio-rectal fossa, where it gives ofi its hajmoii-hoidal and perm<eal branches, and ends in the dorsal nerve of the penis. The latter accompanies the pudic artery thi-ough the deep perinajal mterspace, lying to its outer side in the fibres of the compressor ui-ethree and supplying the muscle, finally piercing the superficial layer of the triangular Hgament with and external to the dorsal artery. Its com-se and distribution on the penis wlLL be seen later. The Deep Layer of the Triangular Ligament (Figs. lOo, 106) closely resembles the superficial layer in its mode of attachment to the ischio-pubic rami, but is placed higher and may be regarded as a continuation of the obturator fascia across the sub-pubic arch. It is in contact hdoic with the deep transversus permasi, and above with the fat of the anterior extension of the ischio-rectal fossa, the apex of the prostate, the recto-vesical fascia, and the antenor tibres of the levator ani. It is pierced posteriorly by the mternal pu^c vessels and dorsal nerve of the penis.'and in the middle Ime by the urethra. The dorsal vein of the penis runs between its apex and the sub-pubic ligament.

The devp luytr of superficial fascia is not so strongly marked as in the male, but has the same connections. It is continuous with the deep fascia of the groin, and is attached on each side to the margins of the rami of the os jiubis and ischium, nearly to the tuberosity. It then makes a tiu-n around the superficial trans- versus perintei muscle on each side, and joins the triangulai' ligament. Owing to the position of the vulva, the deep layer of superficial fascia is divided in the middle line and becomes continuous with the sheath of the vagina; and the pouch between the deep layer of superficial fascia and the triangular ligament (p. 209) is divided into two pai'ts, which have been named the pudendal or vulvo-scrokd sues of Broca. [The deejD layer of superficial fascia is to be removed, and the superficial perinjeal vessels and nerves dissected out, care being taken to i^reserve the transvers;is perinsei muscle, which passes outwards and backwards from the central point of the perinjeum.] The Superficial Perinseal Artery (artery of the labium) (Fig. 108, 5) is a branch of the internal pudic artery, and is larger than in the male. It arises luider cover of the ramus of the ischium and runs forwards and inwards, to enter the pouch of fascia by piercing the hinder border of the triangular ligament, then passing over or imder the superficial transversus periuEei muscle to supply the superficial muscles of the perinseum and the labirmi. It gives off the transverse perimeul artery (4), which runs towards the median line close to the superficial transverse muscle, and anastomoses with the opposite artery and with the neighbouring branches. Veins corresponding to the arteries open into the internal pudic vein. The Superficial Perinaeal Nerves (Pig. 108) are two in number, and ai'e branches of the pudic nerve.

The Inferior Pudendal Nerve (Fig. 108, 2) is a branch of the small sciatic nerve, which pierces the dee]) fascia of the thigh about an inch in front of the tuberosity of tho ischium.

The Bulbo-C avernosus (sphincter vaginfe) (Fig. 109, 5) arises on each side fi'om the elastic jDerinEBal body between the anus and vagina, a few of its supei-ficial fibres being prolonged into the sphincter ani; it also arises from the reflection of the deep layer of superficial fascia (ischio-perinseal ligament of Savage) for nearly an inch, and decussates with the inner fibres of the transversus perintei. The fibres of the muscle overlie the bulbi vestibuli and glands of Bartholin, and are divisible into three sets, corresponding with those of the bulbo-cavernosus of the male. The anterior fibres pass forward on each side of the vulva to meet those of the opposite muscle upon the cHtoris, and to be partially inserted into the sheath of the clitoris; the middle fibres pass beneath the cHtoris and over the great veins upon the urethra [pars inierme- dialis), which are analogous to the corpus spongiosiim of the male, and meet those of the opposite side; the posterior fibres pass on to the triangular ligament (Savage). The Erector Clitoridis (Fig. 109, 3) resembles the erector penis in the male, and though actually smaller in size, bears a much larger proportion to its organ than that muscle. It arises from the front of the tuber ischii, and is inserted on the sides of the cms clitoridis. The Transversus Perinaei (Fig. 109, 7) (irises from the inner side of the I'amus of the ischium, and meets its fellow muscle of the opposite side in the central perinasal body, where it is blended with the fibres of the bulbo-cavernosus and sphincter ani, and the deep part of the sphincter vaginie. The Levator Ani (Fig. 109, 11) is divided by Savage into three parts: 1. The pubo-coccyf/ens, now seen in part, its fibres havin"- the same direction as the sphincter ani. It arises from the back of the pubes, and its fibres cross the rectum between the superficial and deep sphincters, and are inserted into the side of the last two bones of the coccyx. 2. The oUimito-aicci/gens, which arises from the line of division of the pelvic fascia, into obturator and recto- vesical layers {white line), and is also inserted into the side of the last two bones of the coccyx. 3.

The Bulb of the Vagina (Fig. 109, 8) or bulbus vestibuli of Kobelt corresponds precisely to one half of the bulb of the male. It is a vascular bodj^ placed on the side of the orifice of the vagina, and enclosed in a sheath of fascia derived from the triangular liga- ment or deep perineal fascia. Each bulb is about an inch long, and is composed of a plexus of veins, which communicate with those of the opposite side beneath the cUtoris. The forepart of the plexus is sometimes known as the pm-s irderinediah's. The Superficial Layer of the Triang-ular Ligament resembles that of the male, and is a strong process of fibrous tissue stretch- ing across the pubic arch, to be attached to the rami of the os pubis and ischium on each side beneath the crura clitoridis. It is perforated by the urethra and is divided posteriorly by the vagina, with the coats of which it is firmly incorporated; it gives passage also to the terminal branches of the pudic arteries and nerves, as in the male, and to the large veins of the clitoris and bulbi vestibuli, which pass to the plexus around the base of the bladder. [The superficial layer of the triangular ligament is to be care- tuUy detached from the bone and removed, when the deep trans- versus pennsei and the terminal branches of the pudic arterv and nerve are to be dissected.] ■ The Deep Transversus Perinaei (Compressor Urethrre) has the same attachments as in the male, but consists largely of unstrined fibre. ^ Involuntary cii-cular fibres surround the whole length of the female urethra, and may correspond to a portion of the prostate in the male. The Glands of Bartholin (Fig. 109, 12) correspond to Cowper's glands in the male, but are more superficially placed. Each -land is of the size of a smaU bean, and is situated behind the bulb" Its minute duct opens on the mucous surface in front of the hymen about midway between the cHtoris and posterior commissure Pudic Artery and Nerve (Fig. 108). The tenninations of the pudic artery and nerve in the female correspond closely to those of the male but are much smaller. The artery lies unde; cover of the rXLl ti«.-t\the nerve, and gives ofP arteries to h bulb and crus clitondis, and the dorsal artery of the clitoris in t^: ^'/^'J:^' tenuinates orjan. ""^ " '"^'^ ''^ - thatTHE ABDOMINAL WALL. 224 The dorsal artery of the clitoris (i) reaches the dorsum of the organ with the corresponding nerve. The Dorsal Vein of the clitoris is of large size, and passes back- wards to open into the great veins around the neck of the bladder. The Pndic Nerve (9) gives off muscular branches (12), and ends in the dorsal nerve of the clitoris (10), which bears a much larger proportion to that organ than the corresponding nerve of the penis. The Deej:) Layer of the Triangular Ligament differs from that in the male only in being pierced by the vagina. [The flaps of skin should be carefully fastened together with stitches before the body is moved from its position.] Dissection of the Abdominal "Wall. The dissection of the Perineum having been completed, the student should proceed to examine the abdominal wall, the condition of which will vary considerably in different subjects. In a fat subject the waU of the abdomen will be smooth and uniform, but in a thin muscular subject the prominences of the muscles will be readily recognised. In all bodies the lunbiHcus will be seen m the median line about midway between the pubes and the eusiform cartilage of the sternum, and nearly in a Hue with the highest point of the ihac crest. The median line above the vunbiUcus will be found to be sHghtly depressed, corresponchng, as will be afterwards seen, to the linea alba. On each side of the median line, and parallel to it, is the promi- nence caused by the rectus abdominis muscle, bounded externally by the linea semilunaris, and occasionaUy the markings m that muscle known as the linew transversa: cai^ be seen through the skhi. Immediately above the pubes and close to the median Ime is occa- sionally seen the prominence of the pyi-aniidalis muscle on each side The pubic crest and spine will be recognised with the huger, andl'onparfs li<,ame,d, attached to the latter, will be followed a ong the fold of the groin to the anterior superior spinous process ot the iUrnn On the sides of the lower part of the thorax, the mter- digitations of the obliquus extcrnus with the serratus magnus may be seen through the skin, in a well-developed sub|ect, and a lateral subcostal fossefte indicates the upper end of the linea semiluxiaris. Below, the iliac crest will be found curving backwards and up- wards from the anterior superior spine, and a tubercular prominence is felt a little in front of its midpoint between its two extremities ' The condition of the abd.uninal rings and inguinal canal shoulrt be carefully examined before the skin is removed. If the spermatic225 NERVES OF ABDOMINAL WALL. cord be traced up from the testis, it may be felt to disappear tbrougb iin opening known as tbe external abdominal ring, and even in a perfectly well-formed subject the fore-finger can be passed into the ring with tolerable facility, if pushed up fi'om below, carrying the scrotiun before it. In a subject with a tendency to hernia, the finger can be carried along the inguinal canal to the internal abdominal ling, or if a ruptiu-e actually exists, may be passed into the abdominal cavity, pushing the loose skin before it. In the female, the abdominal ring is usually of small size, and generally too contracted to admit the finger, but may be enlarged by a hernia. The projection above the pubes, which is covered with hair and known as the mans Veneris, is due simply to a development of fat in the superficial fascia at this point. The skin of the abdomen of women who have borne children is marked by numerous small white scars, the result of its over-distension during pregnancy. [In order to dissect the abdominal wall, it is necessary to distend the abdomen fully with air. To do this, a narrow knife should be thrust through the mubilicus into the peritoneal cavity, and a blowpipe shoiild be inserted. A circular incision should previously be made through the skin round the umbilicus, and a piece of whipcord tied round the blowpipe in the groove cut in the skin. When the abdomen has been fully distended, the blowpipe is to be withdi-awn, and the opening carefully secured. One incision is to be carried from the ensiform cartilage to the pubes (avoiding the umbilicus), and another along the crest of the ihum and from the anterior superior spine of the ilium horizontally to the middle Hue, joining the first at right angles. A thiixl at the level of the ensiform cartilage is to reach well back to the loms. _ The skin is then to be reflected from the median line by these incisions.] The Superficial Fascia in this region resembles that through- out the body, but is sometimes much loaded with fat; it is to be reflected by the same incisions as the skin, and in doing this there wni be found in it the cutaneous nerves. The Cutaneous Nerves (Fig. 110) consist of two sets, anterior and lateral. The anterior nerves, which are very small, will bo found in two rows, one close to the linea alba, and the other piercing the tendon of the external oblique near the outer border of the rectus ; the lateral branches will be found of greater length running along the fibres of the same muscle and also givino- a few small twigs backwards. Both sets are derived from the .".ix lower thoracic spmal nerves. About two inches behind the anteriorspine ot the ilmm and half an inch above the crest will bo found the226 THE ABDOMINAL WALL.

Accompanjdng the nerves will be found (in a well-injected body only) small branches of arteries derived from the intercostal, internal mammary, and eiJigastric arteries. [The external oblique muscle is to be cleaned, the dissector begmmng from below on the right side, and from above on the left and takmg care not to remove its tendon near the median Hne by niistake. The mterdigitations with the sen-atus magnus and latissimus dorsi are to be carefully defined.] The Obliquus Externus (Fig. Ill, 12) arises from the outer surfaces of the bony portions of the eight lower ribs, and from the intercostal fascia between the bones, interdigitating with the sen-atus magnus bj- four or five points above, and' with the latissimus dorsi by three or four points below. Its fibres pass downwards to the middle'line and pelvis (p. 229). [In order to see the whole of the insertion of this muscle it will be necessary to contmue the dissection by reflecting the triangle of skm left upon the grom.] & The Superficial Fascia of the Groin (Fig. 112) is divisible into two layers—supei-ficial and deep. The supn-fidal layer of superficial fascia {a) resembles that found elsewhere, but the deep layer {b) (Scai^pa's fascia) is more mem- branous. It IS du-ectly continuous with the deep layer of the superficial fascia m the perinoeum (p. 209), opposite the upper limit oi the attachment of the genitals, and is attached firmly to the fascia lata of the thigh below Poupart's Ugament, thus preventinc any urine which may have been infiltrated into the tissues from passing down the thigh.

The former is distributed to the skin above the pubes, the latter to that of the scrotum and penis or labium, according to the sex, and to the inner side of the upper part of the thigh. Lower Attachment of Obliquus Externus (Fig. 111).— (1) To the anterior half of the outer lip of the crest of the ilium ; Poupart's ligament succeedmg this attachment is merely the thickened lower border of the aponeurosis of the external oblique, reaching from the anterior superior spine of the ilium to the spine of the OS pubis, and receiving the attachmeiit of the falciform process of Bm'ns fi'om the fascia lata of the thigh. (2) The pubic spine and crest of the same side, and the inner portion of the ilio- pectineal line. A triangular band of strong fibres runs from the inner extremity of Poupart's ligament to the innermost part of the ilio-pectineal line of the same side, immediately internal to the femoral sheath. This is known as Grimbernat's ligament, and will be met within the dissection of femoral hernia. From Gimbernat's ligament a process is reflected upwards and inwards to the lower part of the linea alba, and is called the triangular fascia. (3) To the whole length of the median line from the ensiform cartilage to the sjTnphysis pubis, blending with the aponeurosis of the internal oblique. The posterior free border of the muscle between the ribs and ilium is usually separated fi-om the anterior free border of the latissimus dorsi by a triangular interval, the " triauf/le of Petit," the base of which is formed by the iliac crest, and the floor by the obliquus internus. Immediately above and external to the pubic spine, the spermatic cord (or the round ligament of the uterus in the female) will be seen to emerge from an opening in the tendon, the external 12.

The tendinous fibres limiting it above and below have been named the jn/lurs or columns of the rimj. It will be observed that the outer pillar is flat and triangular at the upper part, but becomes round and thick below, where it is attached to the pubic spine and corre- sponds to the inner extremity of Poupart's ligament; whilst the internal pillar attached to the pubic crest is flat and continuous with the rest of the tendon. At the ujDper part of the ring may be seen some cvirved fibres running in a transverse direction and called the intercolumnar fibres, the continuation of which forms the inter- columnar or external spermatic fascia, and is prolonged as a covering of the cord and testicle. It should be noticed that the spermatic cord does not lie in the centre of the ring, but upon the outer pillar or Poupart's ligament, which is slightly drawn down by the weight of the testis. [The external oblique is to be reflected by cutting, both vertically and horizontally, thi'ough its muscular fibres where they join the tendon, and by detaching them from the ribs immediately below their origin. The greater part of the muscle can then be turned back towards the loin, and the corresponding tendon may be dis- sected up as far as possible towards the median line. The handle of the knife should be passed under the triangular portion of tendon left in the groin, after which the tendon may be readily divided by a vertical incision, parallel to and as near the median line as possible, and reflected towards the thigh without endangering the subjacent parts. When this is done, it wiU be found that the tendinous' fibres of one side decussate or interlace with those of the other imme- diately above the pubes in the manner described. The internal oblique muscle will then be exposed, and wiU be most readily cleaned by beginning at the lower border of the muscle on the right side, and at the upper border on the left side of the subject. Near Poupart's ligament, a little more of the ilio-hypogastric and ilio-inguinal nerves will be seen.] The Obliquus Internus (Fig. Ill, i8).—The fibres of this muscle take a direction opposite to those of the obliquus externus. The origin is from the posterior tendon of the tranversalis muscle (the so-called "fascia lumborum" or "lumbar apoiiouro.sis"), from the anterior two-thirds of the middle lip of the crest of the iluim, and the outer half of Poupart's ligament. The upper fibres pass to bo insi-rted into the lower margins of the cartilages of the last throe ribs, where they fall into a line with those of the internal intercostal muscles. Below this the muscle is inserted into the xiphoid appendix and hito the linea alba by an aponeurosis, whichTHIi ABDOMINAL WALL. 232 splits to enclose the rectus in its upper two-thirds and passes in front of the muscle below (see p. 236); wliile the lower fibres, becoming gradually more and more horizontal in their course to the middle line, in the end arch downwards to be inserted iato the pubic crest, and into the ilio-pectineal line behind the attachment of Gimbernat's ligament, blending with a part of the attachment of the transversalis to form the conjoined tendon. In the male subject, some pale muscular fibres will be found to be continuous with the lower border of the internal oblique, and to descend upon the sperm atic cord and testicle. These form the cremnster. The Cremaster (Fig. US, A) consists of a series of thin mus- cular loops united by delicate fascial tissue, spread over the spermatic cord and upper part of the testicle. It is attached extevKcdhj to the inner pai-t of Poupart's Ligament, -where it is continuous with the origin of the internal obhque, and inter- nally to the spine f\nd crest of the pubes. This musculo-fascial lamina constitutes one of the investments of the cord and testicle, and as it separates the fascia spermatica externa (inter- columnar fascia) from the fascia spermatica interna (infundibuli- form process of fascia transver- salis), it might be termed the fascia spermatica media. The cremaster is si^^plied by the genital branch of the genito-criu-al nerve. . .„ , To explain the formation of this muscle it will be necessary to refer to the early stage of foetal life, when the testis was situated within the abdomen and immediately below the kidney. About the seventh month of foetal life the testis passes through FigB. 113, 114, 115.-Diagran,B to illustrate the deBcent of testis and tin- foniiation of the tunica vagmahs (drawn by J. 1. tTiaj ).233 DESCENT OF THE TESTIS. the iiiternal abdominal ring, and by the eighth, montb reaches the scrotum, a process of jjeritoneum {processus vafjindlis) preceding it. The looped fibres of the crem;)ster would appear to be fibres of the internal oblique daawn down by the testicle in its descent. According to Curling, a muscular band, consisting of three sets of fibres and called the r/uberiiaculuin testis, passed from the pubes to the testis, and its divisions had the following attachments—one to the bottom of the scrotum, and one on each side of the external abdominal ring, to Poupart's ligament and the crest of the pubes (Fig. 113). By the action of these bands the testicle was drawn down as far as the external abdominal ring, but it is obvious that when it had reached this point the lateral bands must have become Fig. 114. Fig. 115. horizontal, and thus have lost all power of traction ; and the further progress ut the testis depended therefore upon the middle band, which continued to draw the gland to the bottom of the scrotum (i^'g. 114). The effect of this was to stretch tho lateral bands attached to the pubes on each side, and thus they were drawn down with the cord, in which they are probably represented in the adult by some unstripcd muscular fasciculi called by Heule the "internal cremaster." The external cremaster is formed by the lower fibres of the internal oblique, which were carried down" with the testicle in its progress (Fig. 11.5). It must bo added, however t mt more recent observations render it doubtful if the descent of tlie testis IS actually accomplished by these means. t>.^T^"/"u''r"''! "bliquo is to be divided by n, vertical incision from the lust rib to the middle of the cre.st of the ilium and thfs is llZTHE ABDOMINAL WALL. 234 carried along the crest and Poupart's ligament to near the lower border of the muscle. The muscnlar fibres must be carefully (livided until a cellular interval is reached, in which, near the cnsta ilii, will be found the branches of an artery (deep circumflex ihac). The muscle is then to be turned backwards and forwards, care being taken not to injui-e the exposed vessels and ner^^es or the subjacent transversalis muscle.] The Nerves (Fig. 110), five or six in number, are branches of the lower thoracic nerves, which run horizontally forwards to pierce the rectus muscle and emerge on the front of the abdomen. At this stage they may be seen giving off theii- lateral mtaneous branches, which pierce the obhquus internus and externus at once. Close above the crista ilii may be found the iUo-hypogastric and ilio-inguinal branches of the first lumbar nerve (i6), runnmg downwards towards the pubes. The ilio-htjpogastric has been seen to supply the skin above the pubes the ilio-mguinal that of the penis and scrotum (labium m female) and inner side of the thigh. From one of these nei^es usually the ilio-hypogastric, is given off an iliac branch which pierces the external oblique and its fascia above the crest of the iUum and descends upon the outer side of the buttock to supply the integument of that region. The twelfth thoracic nerve also sends an iliac cutaneous twig to supply an area of skin m front of the distribution of the last-named branch. The arteries of the abdominal wall are derived from the lower intercostals and from the kmrbar branches of the abdominal aorta; their course resembles that of the corresponding nerves and they anastomose with the deep circumflex iliac laterally and with the deep epigastric anteriorly. A large branch o the deep ™- flex iliac artery runs vertically upwards between the internal oblique and ti-anversalis from a short distance behind the antenoi superior iliac spine. . . . The Transversalis Muscle (Fig. 116, 6) has its or,<pn-h fiom the inner surfaces of the cartilages of the lower six ribs, where it interdigitates with the diaphragm; 2, by a strong aponeurosis which posterioriy is divided into thi-ee lamm., the an eno^^^^ wHch is attached to the intertransverse liganients and antouoi sm faces of the transverse processes; the middle to the ^^V^ fJ^' transverse processes; and the posterior to the «P;^«"f^ and-supra-spinous ligaments of all the lumbar vertobrre (foinnn, the greater part of what is sometimes called the hnnbar apoue^ros'. ^^i:iLora.)

Its tendon of insertion passes to the linea alba behind the rectus, from the ensiform cartilage to about the junction of the middle and lower thirds of the muscle, and in front of it below this point as far as the pubes, being inseparably united with the aponeurosis of the internal oblique ; and into the pubic crest and ilio-pectineal line, forming with the internal oblique the conjoined tendon. Action.—The transversalis is essentially a contractile abdo- minal belt, and has little or no influence upon the movements of the trunk. The obhqui aid the transversalis in constricting the abdominal cavity, and are also direct and lateral flexors of the lumbar portion of the ver- tebral column; and all these muscles aid in expu-ation, partly by drawing down the ribs and sternum, and partly by upward pressure of the diaphi-agm through the medium of the vis- cera. They are hence muscles of locomotion (except the trans- versalis), of abdominal con- striction, and of expiration. Pig. 116.

It shoiild be understood that the cUstinction of the aponeuroses of the obliqui and trans- versalis from each other is virtual ouly, and cannot be demonstrated by the dissector. The point where the sheath ceases to pass behind the rectus is marked by a sharp curved margin (fold of Douglas), in front of which the epigasti'ic vessels will be seen to pass, and enter the substance of the muscle. This will be afterwards seen from behind (Fig. 123, c). [In many subjects immediately above the pubes, in front of the rectus and enclosed in its sheath, will be found a little muscular slip, the pyramidalis. Both muscles are to be cleaned ui the direction of their fibres.] The Pyramidalis (Fig. Ill, 17) arises from the crest of the pubes close to the median line, and passes up for about two inches to be inserted into the linea alba. The Rectus Abdominis (Fig. Ill, 16) arises from the pubic crest and supra-pubic ligament, and by an interlacement fi'om ,the front of the pubic bones and interpubic joint. The inner fibres of origin are fleshy, the outer tendinous, but there is no division into two " heads." It expands into a broad muscle, and is inserted into the ensiform cartilage and into the anterior surface of the cartilages of the last three true ribs (oth, 6th, and 7th), and slightly into the 5th rib external to its cartilage. The linece transversm are tendinous intersections corresponding to abdominal ribs; one is placed nearly opposite the lunbilicus, a second at the level of the ensifoi-m cartilage, a third between these, and a fourth is occasionally found between the umbilicus and the pubes. They seldom extend through the whole of the muscular fibres, and are distinct only in front, where they adhere firmly to the sheath. The rectus is a powerful fl.ex<ir of the htmhar rertehrcv, inclining the thorax upon the pelvis or vice versa. It acts as ahdnmiual compressor mainly by increasing the resistance of the anterior abdominal wall during the action of the other muscles of the region,* and it assists expiration by dra wing down the sternum and sternal extremities of the ribs. * If the abdomen bo sunken the line of the rectus presents a forward con- cavity, and during contraction tlie muscle becomes more widely separated from the spine and will hence tend to reduce the pressure upon the" viscera238 THE ABDOMINAL WALL. Ihe abdominal muscles are swiipUvd by the lower six intercostal nerves, and by the ilio-bypogastric and ilio-inguinal branches of the first hunbar nerve (L'ig. 110). _ The Deep Epigastric Artery (Fig. 118), with its vense comites will be traced into the back of the rectus muscle, where the sheath is deficient, passing in front of the fold of Douglas. The muscle should be divided and the artery will be seen runmng towards the sternum, anastomosmg with the lumbar, lower inter- costal, and superior epigastric branch of the internal mammary artery in its course. _ . , The nerves piercing the rectus are the tei-minations of the lower intercostal nerves, which pass through it and its sheath to reach the surface near the middle line and supply the cutaneous area between the linea alba and linea semilunaris. The Fascia Transversalis is the membrane Immg the trans- versalis muscle, and is continuous with the fusda iHaca (covering the iliacus and psoas muscles) at the iliac crest and Pouparts ligament, and with the diaphragmatic fascia at the line of origin of this muscle. Opposite the point at which the external iliac vessels pass beneath Poupart's ligament it gives a process to strengthen L anterior wall of the femoral sheath, while the fascia iliaca pass s upon the ilio-psoas beneath the sheath but without aiding it. formation.

The tissue beneath this muscle is the fasaa239 INGUINAL HERNIA. frausvi'i-sa/is {Fig. US, /), and between this and the peritoneum is the subperitoneal tissue. Both of these layers are prolonged upon the cord and testicle as an infundibulifoi-m sheath, and the internal orifice of the funnel, when artificially defined with the knife, is called the internal abdominal ring. The prolongation of fascia transversalis itself is called the in/undihuliform or internal spermatic fascia (Fig. 118, /). The Internal Abdominal Ring (Fig. 119), an artificial opening in the fascia tranversalis, is placed midway between the spine of the pubes and the anterior superior iliac spine, and about half an inch above Poupart's ligament, immediately outside the deep epigastric vessels. The fascia is distinctly thickened at the lower and outer parts of the ring. The Inguinal Canal (Figs. 118, 119) is an interspace about an inch and a half in length, transmitting the cord and extending from the internal to the external abdominal ring. In front it is bounded by 1, (in its whole length) the tendon of the external oblique ; 2, (in its outer third) the lowest part of the muscular fibres of the internal oblique. Behind are—beginning nearest the internal ring—1, the fascia tranversalis (for the whole length of the canal) ;• 2, the conjoined tendon (in its inner third), and the triangular fascia (if it exists); 3, the deep epigastric vessels (immediately to the inner side of the internal abdominal nng). Below is the line of junction between Poupart's ligament and the lower border of the fascia transversalis. Above is the arched border of the transversalis muscle, and sometimes a stronger band of fibres in the fascia transversalis running over the vascular sheath (Pig. 123). Inguinal Hernia is of two kinds, oblique and direct. The oblique passes through the internal abdominal ring, along the inguinal canal and out of the external ring. The direct hernia breaks thi-ough or pushes before it the posterior waU of the mgiunal canal at its inner part, iil a triangular space caUed HesselbarlCs iriavij/e, bounded by the deep epigastric artery externally, the rectus internaUy, and Poupart's ligament below'; and emerges at the external ring, thus taking a more direct course than the oblique variety.

It would not, however, receive its cremasteric investment in either case until it entei's the scrotum. By dividing the fascia transversalis immediately to the inner side of the internal abdominal ring, there will be found the deep epigasti-ic artery, running with its vena? comites in a line from the middle of Poupart's ligament towards the umbilicus; and the varieties of inguinal hernia have been named external or interiml according to their relation to this vessel. It is obvious that a Fig. 119. Fascia transversalis Conjoined tendon Triangular fascia Deep epigastric artery. Internal obliqiie. Cremaster. External oblique. hernia, passing through the internal ring must be external to this artery, and heoce oblique hernia and external hernia are sjmony- mous terms. In the same way, dii'ect hernia protrudes thi'ough the abdominal wall to the inner side of the epigastric artery, and thus internal is the same as dii-ect hernia. The anatomy of the parts concerned in hernia being fully com prehended, it wiU be readily seen that the direction in which force IS to be appHed to return the protruded bowel into the abdomen- common ly called the <«x/.-must differ in the two cases; and the student should notice the effect which the position of the body and limbs has upon the tissues near tlie groin. Thus, with the Pig. I19.-Diagram of the inguinal canal, showing its anterior and post^ boundaries (drawn by J. T. Gray). IJo«ceuoi•242 THK ABDOMINAL WALL. body and legs extended at full length, the lower part of the abdomen is rendered tense; whilst if the thigh is flexed upon the pelvis and adducted, and the body bowed forward, the structures become relaxed, and would more readily admit of the return of the protruded bowel. Varieties of Hernia.—Them are two varieties of oblique inguinal hernia termed amgeiiital hernia and infantile or encysted hernia, the anatomy of which requires explanation. To understand these fully it wiU be necessary to refer again to the descent of the testis (p. 232). When the testicle is in the abdomen it has the peritoneum attached to its surface, and during its descent into the scrotiun it accordingly carries a fold of peritoneum down with it, so that at first a tube extends along he whole length of the inguinal canal (Pig. Ho). By a natural Pig. 120. Fig. 121. Fig. 122. process during the ninth month of foetal life, however, an obliteration of the portion of tube within the canal takes place, and thus a small sac is formed around the testis, which is called the tnmca raainalis, while a mere dimple is left in the peritoneum at the internal rin-. Thus in the ordinary condition of the parts when a hernia descends, its sac is above and quite distinct from the tunica vaginalis (Fig. 120). Fig. 120.-Diagrain of a common scrotal hernia, showing the relation of the mio to the tunica vaginalis testis {J. T. Gray). Fig 121.-Diagram of a congenital hernia, the sac being contmuous wth the tunica vaginalis testis (J. T. Gray). ■ i:„ Fi" m.-Diagram of an infantile hernia, showing the tuu>ca vagn>ah« prolonged in front of the sac (J. T. Gray).THE SPERMATIC CORD. 243 Occasionally, however, this obliteration does not occur, and the tunica vaginalis remains continuous with the peritoneum. In that case the hernia descends at once into the tunica vaginalis and lies in contact with the testis, and being the consequence of a congenital defect it is termed iviKjenitid hernia (Fig. 121). fnfuniilc or mrystcd lierniu exists when only a jmrtial obliteration of the peritoneal tube has taken place, the tunica vaginalis being left larger than usual and extending upwards, towards or into the inguinal canal. Should a hernia descend, it passes down behind this portion of the tunica vaginalis, and there are then three layers of serous membrane in front of that covering the intestine, two being formed by the tunica vaginalis and one by the peritoneal sac (Fig. 122). The Spermatic Cord may now be examined, and will be found to consist of (1) the oas deferens or duct of the testicle, together %Yith the deferential branch of the superior vesical artery and the deferential veins with lymphatics; (2) the spermatic artery ^vith its compHcated plexus of veins and the testicular lymphatics- (a) the spermatic plexus of nerves ; (4) the internal cremaster, small bauds of uustriped muscular fibre, probably the relics of the lateral bands of the gubernaculum testis; (5) the obliterated processus va-nnalis of the peritoneum ; (6) sub-peritoneal connective tissue surroundiuo- aU the structures named and sometimes bearing more or less fat in its me.shes.

Below the orifice of the urethra will be found the fold called the franum preputii, and around the base of the glans penis is a cii-cular ridge, the corona ghindis, upon which open a number of sebaceous glands, the (jlamlidm odoriferce, that secrete the smegma 'preputii. An mcision is to be carried along the upper surface of the penis, when there will be found in the middle line the single dorsal vein, with the dorsal artery and nerve on each side of it, the nerve being most external. The artery and nerve are the terminations of the pudic artery and nerve, and the vein passes between the sub-pubic liga- ment and the two triangular Ugaments to open into the prostatic plexu.s. The structure of the penis will be described hereafter. The Suspensory Liyameut of the penis is a strong triangular band of fibrous tissue, attached to the front of the symphysis pubis, and divides into two layers to give passage to the dorsal vessels and nerves, and embrace the adjacent part of the penis. The anylr of the penis lies immediately beyond the suspensoiy ligament. [The abdominal wall having been finished on both sides, the dissectors should cut thi-ough the remains of the abdomina muscles in two or three places until the peritoneum is exposed, bu* without Siuring the latter, in order to study the appearance of the mem- bilne which forms the sac of a hernia. They should then open the abdomen and dissect the viscera.] Cavity of the Abdomen. TThe abdomen is to be opened by a transveree incision at the level of the umbilicus, and another cut is to be earned from the umbilicus to the sternum, a little to the left of the median Ime.] By holding up the lower portion of the abdominal waU before dividing it in the median line, and viewing it from behind, the dissectors will perceive through the peritoneum five cords taking a course towards the umbilicus (Fig. 123). The centi^l cord is ihe obliterated lu-achus those on each side of it are the obliterah^. hypogastric arteries (r), and the most external correspond to the two deep epigastric arteries (i).

" (</) has been applied to the triangular space bounded by the border of the rectus internally', the epigastric artery externally, and Poupart's ligament below, and it is through this that direct inguinal hernia forces its way. It is subdivided into two parts by the obliterated hypogastnc artery, which, like the epigastric artery, is often supported by a distinct fold of peritoneum. The foM of Douglas (t), or sharp lower margin of the posterior sheath of the rectus, will be readily perceived through the peritoneum. [By dividing the lower portion of the abdominal wall in the median line, it can be reflected on each side, and the abdominal contents will be exposed.] Abdominal Cavity.—The parts first seen on opening the abdo- men are the stomach and portions of the right and left lobes of the liver ; and the gaU-bladder if distended generally lies at the right costal margin where this is joined by the linea semilunaiis; but it must be remembered that the liver is higher in the recumbent than in the erect position, and that in the child the organ is larger and the right lobe extends nearly or quite to the median line in front. The great omentum passing down from the stomach con- ceals the rest of the intestines. Should, however, the omentum be turned up, as often happens, the mass of the smaU intestines will be visible, and immediately below the stomach the transverse colon. The ascending colon on the right and sigmoid flexure on the left side will be more or less visible according to the amount of then- Fig 124 -Superficial dissection of thorax and abdomen (from Maclise's Surgical Anatomy.)

Tlie cfecum may usually be seen a little internal to the right anterior superior iliac spine, and a portion of the sigmoid flexure at the corresponding point on the opposite side. A very much distended bladder, or the pregnant uterus, would also be apparent. Eeg-ions of the Abdomen.—Por convenience of description the abdomen is divided into nine regions, by foiu' imaginary planes, two longitudinal and two ti-ansverse. Of these regions three are median, and are called respectively epigastric, umbilical, and hypo- gastric, in their order from above downwards, and the remaining six He three on each side, and are named hjqjochondriac, lumbar, and iHac or inguinal. So far all anatomists have been agreed for some centimes, but imfortunately even at the present day there is no universally accepted rule for the position of the subdividing planes, and consequently the epigastric, lumbar, or other region of one text-book may differ very widely in dimensions from that described in another. Under these circimistances it is doubtful whether it would not be better to abandon altogether the use of terms which have no jDrecise meaning. The following scheme of delimitation is perhaps the most convenient. The ujiper truiisverse plant' corresponds to the lowest point of the costal margin on each side, the lower plane to the anterior superior iliac spines. The intersecting JoiKjitudimd planes are drawn upwards, one on each side, from the pubic spine along the outer border of the rectus. The position of the viscera in relation to the regions so marked out may be formulated as follows: Beginning at the upper part, the liver will be found to occupy the right hypochondriac, the ei^igastric, and a small part of the left h;^T30chondriac regions, and may descend into the vipper part of the light lumbar region; passing to it from the umbiHcus will be seen the obliterated imibilical vein. Its anterior margin is sharp; its " vipper " surface, which may be divided into anterior, superior and right lateral faces, corresponds to the diaphragm and to the abdo- minal wall in the .sub-costal angle ; its visceral or " lower" surface looks backwards as well as downwards, and is in contact with the stomach, the commencement of the duodenum, the hepatic flexure of the colon and the right kidney; and its posterior surface will be afterwards seen to be adapted to the crura of the diaphragm, and to the oesophagus, vena cava, and the right suprarenal capsule. The lower end of the thoracic aorta lies behind the crura of the dia- phragm, opposite the intoiwal between the vena cava and oesophagus. 1'hG stomnd, will be seen in the epigastric region, with its greater cul de sac reaching into the left hypochondiium. By drawing this248 CAVITV OF THE ABDOMEN. end out from beneath, the ribs, the spleen will be found attached to it, and is sometimes bound firmly to the diaphragm by old inflam- matory adhesions. Tracing the stomach to the right side it will be found to reach almost to the gall-bladder, terminating in the duodenum, the line of demai'cation being marked by a thickened band of annular fibres, the pjdoric sphincter. In front of the stomach are the diaphragm, the abdominal wall, and the liver; behind it will afterwards be seen the pancreas, the crura of the diaphragm, the aorta and vena cava, and the left kidney and capsule. The duodenum can be followed for a short distance only at present. By drawing up the great omentum, the transverse colon will be exposed crossing the umbilical region, and continuous on the right side with the hepatic flexure (right hji^ochondi-iac region) and ascending colon, and on the left with the splenic flexui-e (left hjT-iochondriac region) and descending colon, which should be traced out. Occiipying chiefly the hyi^ogastric, but extending into all the middle and lower regions, are the coils of the smcill intestiiit, two-fifths of whicb constitute the jejunum, and the remainder the ileum; the latter may be found to end in the large intestine in the rigbt iliac fossa, where the commencement of the colon [caput ccecum coK, or ccecum) will be recognised by its little appendage, the appendix vermiformis. In the left iliac fossa will be seen the tortuous portion of the large intestine, called the sigmoid flexure, which may be ti-aced into the pelvis to its termination in the rectum. The inguinal canals He in the ingiunal regions. It will be well for the student to notice the distinctive appear- ances of the several parts of the intestinal canal, and particularly the differences between the large and small intestines. The con- dition of the intestines varies so much according to the mode of death, that mere size is no criterion, the smaU intestines being occasionally distended to a much greater size than the large ; but attention to the following points will prevent all possibility of error. The cyUnder of the small intestine is uniform throughout, and the surface is perfectly smooth, while the large intestine is pouched or sUghtly constricted at short intervals thi'oughout, excepting the rectum, and is marked by thi-ee distinct bands of longituduial mus- cular fibres, and small sessile or pedunculated excrescences of fat (appendices epiploicce) will be found attached along the Ime of one of these bands. In the healthy condition the large intestine is about as large again as the small intestine. The Peritoneum (Fig. 125).—The serous membrane lining the abdomino-pelvic cavity and covering the viscera is now to be itudicd, and the student must bear in mind that he has already s249 THE PHiRITONEUM.

Eetuming upon itself it forms the posterior lixyei' of the great omentum, and is continued upwards until it meets with the transverse colon, the posterior smiace of which it covers. From the colon it is prolonged to the spine, forming the under layer of the transt'erse meso-colon. It is now carried down over the mesenteric vessels to the small intestine and back to the spine, foi-ming the two layers of the mesentery; thence passing over the posterior abdominal wall into the pelvis, it invests the upper part of the rectum {meso-redum) and in the male passes from that tube to the bladder, forming the redo-vesical pouch; while in the female it is reflected from the rectum on to the upper part of the vagina, as the deep recto-vaginal pouch {cul-de-sac of Douglas), then over the uterus and between the uterus and bladder, fomiing the utero-vesical pouch. Lastly, it is carried over the bladder to the lower part of the anterior abdominal wall and so to the umbilicus. It should be noticed that when the peritoneum approaches the mtestine its two laminre diverge, leaving a triangular interval (on section), with its base at the intestinal wall and its apex towards the root of the mesenteric fold. This interval is occupied by fat (continuous with the subperitoneal tissue), and by the vessels and nerves supplying the gut. As a result of this arrangement, about a fom-th or a fifth of the circumference of the intestinal wall has no serous coat (Fig. 138). In the female the cavity of the greater sac communicates with the genital passages by means of the open mouths of the two Fallopian tubes. The greater sac of the peritoneum has now been traced, but there is another pouch called the lesser sac behind it, and con- tinuous with it through a tube named the /ora^nen of Wwshnr ihis foramen will be found by passing the finger behind the right free border of the gastro-hepatic omentum, immediately below the lobus caudatus of the liver. To expose the cavity of the lesser sac, a longitudinal incision should be carefully made in the middle hne through the two layers of the lesser omentum the pylonc end of the stomach, and the double anterior layer of the great omentum. If the edges of this incision be now widely opened he interior of the sac will fee visible. It will be noticed that it forms above a deep but narrow pouch, embracing the lobus Spigelii and expands transversely below, where it lies behind the stomach and be ween he layers of the great omentum. Tracing it in the longi- tudinal direction from the transverse fissure of the liver the membrane of the lesser sac will be found to form the posterior252 CAVITY OF THE ABDOMEN. layer of the lesser omentum, and cover the posterior surface of the stomach; thence it is prolonged downwards to fonn the second layer of the great omentum as far as the lower edge of this fold, and upwards again as the thii-d layer ; after which it covers the front of the transverse colon and forms the upper layer of the transverse meso-colon. It then invests the anterior suiiace of the pancreas, and is reflected upon the lobus Spigelii and lohns caudatus of the liver, to reach the transverse fissm'e. It will be noticed that the lobus Spigelii is the only portion of the liver covered by the peritoneum of the lesser sac, and that the lobus caudatus coincides in position with the foramen of Winslow. The Foramen of Winslow (Figs. 127 and 128) is simply a kind of hour-glass constriction of the peritoneum dividing it into two parts, and is caused by the passage of the hepatic artery for- wards and upwards from the posterior abdominal wall to the transverse fissure. When the finger is in the foramen it will feel the following boundaries. In front, the lesser omentum, contammg the hepatic artery, portal vein, bile duct, and hepatic nerves and lymphatics ; hehind, the right crus of the diaphragm and the inferior vena cava; hdow, the hepatic artery (as it passes forwards from the aorta) and first part of the duodenum ; above, the lobus caudatus of the hver. ■ The two sacs of the peritoneum may be ti-aced together in the following way. Beginning at the hver, one layer covers the front and the other the back of the under surface of the organ, and the two meet at the transverse fissure to fonn the lesser omentum. Thev then separate to enclose the stomach, unitmg at its lower border to form the anterior double layer of the great omentum; reflected upon themselves, they next form the two posterior layers, which separate to enclose the transverse colon, and form the trans- verse meso-colon as they are prolonged to the spme The two layers now separate. The upper one (lesser sac) is prolonged over tiie pancreas to the under sui-f ace of the Hver ; the under layer (greater sac) covers the lower part of the duodenum m front; then foi-m. the mesentery, the recto-vesical pouch in the male, and the recto- vaginal and utero-vesical pouches in the female, and passes oyer the abdominal wall to the diaphi-agm, fi'om which it is reflected on to the liver, where the description commenced. On passing the hand into the lesser sac, its cavity is found to be shut off from that of the greater sac on the left side by a double lamina of peritoneum. This septal fold is the gastro-phnnm ^'^Thrperitoneum should now be traced horizoutaUy. Below253 THE PERITONEUM. the level of the transverse colon the circle will be found to be exceedingly simple. Beginning at the median liaie of the anterior abdominal wall, the peritoneum may be followed to the, right iliac region, where it will be found to surround the ctecum and to cover the fi-ont of the ascending colon, binding the latter to the posterior abdominal waU; it then foi-ms the mesentery ; and lastly, coveiing the anterior surface of the descending colon and the sigmoid flexure (binding the former to the posterior abdominal wall, and forming for the latter a sigmoid meso-colon), it is brought round again to the anterior abdominal wall. Either the ascending or Fig. 126. the descendmg colon or both may be sm-rounded by perito- neum, and connected to the posterior abdominal wall by a meso- colon ; but in some instances, where a contracted portion of the colon seems to possess a short mesentery, the fold completely disappears after inflation of the tube, and an uncovered portion of the waU comes into contact with the parietes. This fact probably accounts for the discrepancies between the observations of different anatomists as to the frequency of an ascending or descending meso- colon (Fig. 126). A costo-colic fold attaches the splenic flexure of the descendiu- . t5 Pig. 126.—Transverse section of the peritoueum at the fEniest Luiie). S.I. Small intestine. y D.C. Descending colon. ^q' A.C.

Ahove the colon the arrangement is complicated by the existence of the two sacs, the continuity of which may here be demonstrated (Fig. 127). Beginning at the median line of the abdominal wall, the peritoneum may be traced into the right hjqDochondrium and over the right kidney ; it then forms the posterior boundary of the foramen of Winslow, passes in front of the pancreas, and runs forward to the cardiac end of the stomach, forming the gastru-phrenic ligament. It then covers the posterior surface of the stomach, and returns to the foramen of Winslow as the posterior layer of the lesser omentum. Eeflected at this point upon itself, the membrane runs to the left as the anterior layer of the lesser omentum, and is continued over the front of the stomach; thence, formmg the anterior layer of the gastro-splenic omentum, it reaches the s]ileen and encloses it, then forms the posterior layer of the gastro-splemc omentum, passes from tlie spleen to the outer aspect of the left kidney, formingthelieno-renal fold, andsotothe left hypochondnum and roxmd the abdominal wall.

Besides the folds of peritoneimi which have been named in tracing the membrane, there are others which form certain ligaments of the liver and bladder, and of the uterus in the female. Passing from the umbilicus to the liver is seen the obliterated umbilical vein or round Jnjament, and around it is reflected a double fold of peritoneum, the suspensory ot: falciform lujament of the liver. This is prolonged on each side over the diaphi-agm and on to the Fig. 128. upper surface of the Uver, where it forms the upper layer of the c^^-onary hycment; the under layer being formed partly by the lesser sac of the peritoneum, and the triangular surface of the Hver between the two being attached by firm areolar tissue to the diaphragm.

The pusteHur false ligaments are the margins of the recto-vesical pouch, and are formed by the reflection of the membrane over the ureters. The so-called lateral false ligaments are merely the reflections of the peritoneum from the bladder to the sides of the Fig. 129. pelvis, and the mperior is a fold passing over the ui-achus to the umbilicus. i ^ i In the female (Eig. 129), the pelvis is divided ti-ansversely bv folds of peritoneum reaching fi-om both sides of the uterus to the sides of the pelvis, and called the broad ligaments of tbe uterus; they contain the ovaries, the Eallopiau tubes, the iwnd hgament, and other structures. It is by the open mouth of the lallopiau tube that the peritoneum has a communication with the mucous membrane of the uterus.

In the child an arrangement maj' occasionally be found which is extremely rare in the adult—the posterior layer of the great omentum ascending directly to the pancreas, and then being again reflected to the colon to form its meso-colon. Some indication of this may be seen in the adult in the transverse meso-colon near its sjjlenic extremity. Peeitoneal PotrCHES; Aji examination of the interior of the greater sac of the perito- neum shows certain pouches and fossse, some of which are of surgical interest. The principal of these are as follows 1. Fossa phrenico^hepatica.—On the under sm-face of the dia- phi'agm, beginning at the left lobe of the liver and extending to the left, parallel to the coronary ligament of the liver. Its diameter is from a sixth of an inch to an inch and a half. 2. Fossa dt(ode7io-jejunalis.—Situated at the root of the mesen- tery, and is exposed by raising the great omentum with the colon, and drawing the intestines to the right. It runs from left to right, and is of variable size, generally large enough to admit a finger. ' The entrance is bounded on the right side by the termination of the duodenum, on the left side by a semilunar band of peritoneum containing the inferior mesenteric ariery above and the colica smistra below. It sometimes lodges a hernia. _ 3. Fossa wter-sigmoidm.—Jjies at the middle of the root of the sigmoid meso-colon on its left face, and passes upwards on the inner side of the psoas muscle. This fossa is occasionally the seat of a hernia. 3. Fossa suh-cimilis, behind and internal to the CEecum. 6.

The posterior iJeritoneal attachment may be divided into an upper portion connected with the liver, stomach and .spleen, and a lower belonging to the large and smaU intestine. The uppa; commencing with the reflection of the falciform ligament upon the diaphragm, extends backwards somewhat obliquely to join the large ■ area connected with the posterior surface of the right lobe of the liver and the right and left lateral ligaments. From the lower border of the hepatic area runs the posterior attachment of that double layer of peritoneiun (gastro-phi-enic Ugament) which foi-ms the septum between the greater and lesser sacs of peri- toneum on the left side (Figs. 127, 128), and encloses the ceso- phagus, the tail of the pancreas, and the splenic vessels; this passes from the pomt at which the vena cava receives the obUterated ductus venosus, obHqueiy to the left across the diaphi-agm to the front of the left kidney, when it joins the attachment of the splenic flexure ot the colon. The hwer line of attachment commences with the root of the mesentery on the left side of the 2nd bimbar vertebra, at the termination of the 3rd stage of the duodenum. From this point it runs obhquely downwards across the spine into the right iKac fossa where It meets the lowest attachment of the ascending colon and of the httle appendicular fold. Theascendmg colic area runs upwards over the iliac crest, the anterior lamella of the transversalis tendon, and the front of the right kidney; it is succeeded by the attach- ment of the ti-ansverse meso-colon, which extends ti-ausversely across the renal vessels and the pancreas, transmitting between its layers he termination of the first stage of the duodenum above and on the tt r .1' Ti '""^ °^ ^^"^^ "^'i^U- or a httle to the left; and receiving at its left extremity the lower end of he septal fold before referred to.

Beginning at the upper end of the jejunum {i.e., at the point where the small intestine can first be distinctly seen, usually on the left side of the body of the third lumbar vertebra), the dissector should remove the whole of the anterior layer of the mesentery from its root down to the edge of the bowel, where it is to be cut off. This must be continued along the whole length of the small intestine, and the mesentery will be found to pass obliquely downwards from left to light. After the vessels contained in the mesentery are cleaned, the imder layer of the ascending and transverse meso-colon must be removed in the same way, to expose the vessels going to the large intestine.] The Superior Mesenteric Artery (Fig. 131, lo) is the vessel which supplies the small and half the large intestines. A branch of the abdominal aorta, it comes off opposite the first lumbar vertebra immediately behind the neck of the pancreas, and is embraced by an inferior extension of the head of the organ, which passes behind both the artery and vein. It runs forward between the pancreas and the transverse portion of the duodenum, giving off the inferior jmncreatico-duodeiia/ branch (13), which takes a curved course to the right between the head of the pancreas and the duodenum, to anastomose with the superior pancreutico-duodenal artery. The trunk of the superior mesenteric artery will then be seen to take a slightly curved direction from left to right, and from its convexity or left side are given the branches to the small intestine (16) {vasa intestini tenuis), while from its concave right side arise three branches to the large intestine, ileo-colic (15), ri(]ht colic (14), and middle colic (11) arteries (named in their order from below upwards). The branches to the small intestine form a series of primary, secondary, and sometimes tertiary loops, which inosculate freely with one another, and give off straight branches (longer in the irpper than in the lower part of the mesentery) to the intestine, each of which breaks up into two twigs, ojie for each half of the segment of gut supplied. The branches to the large intestine take the com-se indicated by their names; thus the ilocj-colic goes to the end of the ileum and commencement of the colon (caecum), the right colic to the ascending, and the middle colic to the transverse colon. Each of these arteries divides into two branches, which spread out, one on each side, to inosculate with the adjacent branches of the' neigh- bouring vessels, forming the primary loops; the ileo-coHc also anastomoses with the vasa intestini teiuiis. and the middle colic with the inferior mesenteric artery; and thus a free anastomosis is es al5liHhod from one part to another of the intestinal canal. The colica dextra and the upper branch of the colica sinistra pass262 MESENTERIC VESSELS, beneath the peritoneum in frf)nt of the right and left kidneys respectively. Corresponding branches of veins will bo found running with the arteries, and opening into the Superior Mesenteric Vein (Fig. 140, 5), which unites with the splenic to form the vena portie. Fig. 132.

It gives off the hft colic. (10) to the descending coloii; the sujimid (12) (three or fom-) to the sigmoid flexiu'e; and lastly, the siqn-rior lutinorrhoidal artery (13), which descends into the pelvis to supply the rectum. These arteries anastomose fi-eely with one another, foiining loops, and moreover, the left colic "inosculates with the midcUo • colic of the superior mesenteric, the superior htemorrhoidal with the middle hasmorrhoidal of the internal iliac artery, and the uiferior hsemorrhoidal of the internal pudic artery. The superior hasmoiThoidal artery, at first single, bifm-cates on reaching the rectum, and its branches 11m one on each side of the gut. The Inferior Mesenteric Vein (Fig. 140, 4) will be seen to have tributaries coiTesponding to the branches of the artery.

The inferior mesenteric vein passes upwards beneath the pancreas to join the splenic or superior mesenteric vein, and so into the vena portse. Branches of the inferior mesenteric plexus of the sympathetic may be traced upon the vessels from the aortic plexus. It may be noticed that the mesenteric veins have no valves and consequently never present dilatations. Tpie OrELiAC Axis. [The intestines are now to be replaced, and the liver fastened up to the ribs, either with hooks or, better, by a few stitches; the stomach being then drawn down, the lesser omentum is to be carefully removed.] Between the layers of the lesser omentum near its free border will be formd thi-ee importa,nt structiu'es, in the following relation to one another (Fig. 137). To the right and most in front is the bile-duct (7), to the left is the hepatic artery (5), and behind and between the two the large vena portsB (9). Behind the lesser omentum in the middle line will be found the short trunk of the Coeliac Axis, which springs from the fi'ont of the aorta opposite the disc between the last thoracic and first lumbar vertebrte, and runs above the neck of the pancreas to break up into its three branches, viz., the gastric (coronaria ventriculi),the hepatic, and the splenic arteries. The branches are to be cleaned as tar as exposed, but the coeliac axis itself should be left for the present, for fear of injuring the sympathetic plexuses sm-rounding it. The Gastric or Coronary Artery (Fig. 134, 12), the smallest of the three branches, runs at first upwards and to the left in n duplicatui-e of peritoneum, caUed the left pancreatico-gastric fold : it then passes along the lesser curvatiu'e of the stomach from left to right between the layers of the lesser omentum, giving branches to both surfaces of that organ and to the oesophagus. It anastomoses at the pylorus with the pyloric branch of the hepatic artery, and by means of its first or oesophageal branch with the esophageal branches of the thoracic aorta. It gives o£E branches to supply both surfaces of the stomach, notably one large branch running on the anterior surface of the fundus of the stomach. Branches of the spnpathetic (gastric plexus) may be traced upon it. Its accompanying vein opens into (ho vena porta?. The opportunity may be taken to notice the distribution ot265 THE CCELTAC AXIS. the pneumogastric nerve to the stomach.

The Hepatic Artery (Fig. 134, i) curves upwards and to the right side, forming the inferior and anterior boundaries of the foramen of "Winslow, and ends by dividing into the right and left hepatic hraiir.hes, which enter the transverse fissui-e of the liver. The artery gives off first the pyloric branch (3), which has been seen to anastomose at the upper border of the pyloric end of the stomach with the gastric, and secondly a ti-unk which immediately disappears behind the first portion of the duodenum and is called the gastro-duodeval (13). From the right hepatic branch is given off the smaller ci/stic (7) artery, which is disti-ibuted to the gall-bladder by two branches, one passing between it and the liver and the other along its fi'ee surface. The Splenic Artery (Fig. 134, 20) can be seen only in part, taking a tortuous course behind the stomach and along the upper border of the pancreas to the spleen. [To continue the dissection it wiU be necessary to remove the intestines which have been examined, by putting a couple of Hffatui-es uiion the upper part of the jejunum, and also upon the upper part of the rectum, and dividing the intestme between the two ligatures at each point. By cutting the supenor mesenteric artery the small intestine will be at once set fi-ee, but the large intestine must be carefully removed by divicbng the meso-colon close to the intestine throughout, and lastly by cutting the inferior mesenteric artery. The gastro-duodenal and splenic arteries and their branches are then to be cleaned.] The Gastro-duodenal Artery (Fig. 134, 13) can be traced out by tm-ning up the stomach. After passing behind the fii-st portion of the duodenum, it divides into the right gastro-epiploic and the superior pancreatico-duodenal arteries. , „ , The (iastro-epiploira dextra (23) vuns from right to left along the great curvatui-e of the stomach between the folds of the great omentum, supplying branches to both surfaces of the stomach and to the great omentum; it anastomoses with the gastro-epiploicii sinistra of the splenic artery. .„ , . 1 w The I'auaratico-dnodenam superior [17) will be found bet^^cen the duodenum and the head of the pancreas, siu-roundmg the latter, and supplying both; it anastomoses with a small branch rom the commencement of the superior mesenteric artery called the pa,>- creatico-dnodenalis inferior (Fig. 131, 13), and gives branches to both pancreas and duodenum.THE STOMACH. 267 The Splenic Artery (Fig. 134, 20) can now be seen in the whole of its course to the spleen, and breaking np into fom- or five Urmrnal branches, which enter the hilum on the concave surface of that organ. It runs behind the posterior layer of the lesser sac of peritoneum, across the left kidjiey and above the pancreas, and on approaching the spleen it enters the lieno-renal Ligament with, but above, the tail of the pancreas. As it passes along the upper border of the pancreas it gives off small branches to it {pancreaticce parvw), and a larger one {pancreuHm mcu/iia) which runs along the whole length of the gland from left to right, with the duct. It also gives branches {vasa hreviu) (14) to the great end of the stomach, and one of larger size {yastro-cpiploica sinistra) (18), which runs along the great ciu'vature between the layers of the gi-eater omentum, to anastomose with the gastro-epiploica dextra of the hepatic, suppling branches to both sm-faces of the stomach and to the omentum. Upon the hepatic and splenic arteries are corresponding plexuses of the spupathetic. The Splenic Vein (Fig. 140, 2) is placed below its artery, and hes behind the upper border of the pancreas. It receives tributaries corresponding to the branches of the artery, and usually also the inferior mesenteric vein, but the latter may enter the superior mesenteric vein. It is joined by the .superior mesenteric vein behind the upper border of the head of the pancreas, the two forming the vena portte. [The pancreas and duodenum should now be thoroughly defined, and the bile duct and the pancreatic duct traced to their entrance into the mtestme. If desired, the stomach may be removed by tymg and cutting it near the pylorus, and at the oesophagus.] The Stomach is a somewhat pear-shaped viscus, with the greater extremity upwards and on the left, the smaller end at a lower level and on the right side of the median line. It receives at its larger or cardiac end the termination of the oBsophagus, and ends atlts smaller or pyloric extremity in the duodenum. The expansion seen on the left side of the oesophageal opening is called the ,jr,'„t cul ,1,- sac, and a small fusiform dilatation near the pylorus is called the antrum pylori. It is covered by the pcrit()neun"i of the o-reater s-ic in front, and by that of the lesser sac behind; and these layers unite above and below at two lines, the lesser and ,,reat,'r curves running between the ccsophagoal and pyloric extrtnuitics The lesser curve gives attachment to the lesser omentum, and is in contact with an anastomotic loop .between the coronary and pyloric vessels; the gi-cater curve is connected with the greater omentum268 THE STOMACH. below and with tlie gastro-splenic omentum on tlie left, and is traversed by tbe right and left gastro-epiploic vessels (q. v.)- The stomach in the dead subject, unless much distended, is flattened from before backwards, and presents two surfaces and two borders; but during life it is probable that the organ is usually cylindrical in section, and that the inferior border or greater curvature is turned forward towards the abdominal wall.

The spleen lies to the left of the great ciil de sac as well as behind. The cardiac orifice lies about an inch to the left of the middle line on a level with the tenth dorsal vertebra, and behind the junction of the seventh costal cartilage with the sternum in front. The pyloric orifice is usually found behind the quadrate lobe of the^liver, on a level with the first lumbar vertebra and about two inches to the right of the median line; but it extends more to the right when much distended, and is retracted towards the left when emi^ty. The Small Intestine extends from the pylorus to the junction of the CcBciuu and colon. It is an unsacculated tube, averaging about 22 feet in length, with a range of variation from ft. 15^6 to ft. 31-10 (Treves), and diminishes in the width of its calibre and the thickness of its walls from its commencement to its termination.

The Duodenum (Fig. 137, ii) is from eight to ten inches long (twelve iinger-breadths), and makes a pecuLiar bend upon itself before it passes beneath the superior mesenteric vessels and joins the jejunum. It lies in the epigastric and the umbilical regions. The first or ascending iMirtiou, about an inch in length, runs backwards and to the right in contact with the lobus quadi-atus and the adjacent part of the right lobe proper of the liver, there lying m close proximity to the neck of the gall-bladder, and resting against a special impression in front of the lobus caudatus, internal to and between the renal and colic impressions (Fig. 153). It is covered both in front and behind by a prolongation from the lesser omen- tum, and is therefore movable with the stomach. Behind it are the vena portiB, the common bile duct, the gastro-duodenal artery, and a portion of the head of the pancreas. The second or descending portion, three inches long, is partially covered in front by the greater sac of the peritoneum and crossed by the right extremity of the root of the transverse meso-colon. It is bound down to the suiiace of the right kidney and supra-renal body, overlapping also the renal vessels, and descends for about three or four inches behind the transverse colon, reaching nearly as far as the iHac crest and to a level with the lower part of the body of the thii-d lumbar vertebra. It lies in contact with the outer side of the head of the pancreas, the pancreatico-duodenal vessels inter- vening, and the biliary and pancreatic ducts pierce it near the middle of its inner surface. The third or transverse portion, four or five inches m length, is fixed to the abdominal wall below the line of attachment of the meso-colou, and is covered in front by the peritoneum of the greater sac, except where it is crossed anteriorly by the superior mesenteric vessels. It runs obHquely upwards and to the right across the front of the aorta, vena cava, and thoracic duct, from the level of the third to that of the second lumbar vertebra, at the left side of which the gut receives a complete covering of pentoneiun and becomes the jejunum. Immediately above it are the head and the body of the pancreas, with the inferior pancrcatico-duodena and superior mesenteric vessels, the latter afterwards becommg anterior *%he fourth or te.rvirnal 2'ortion of the duodenum ascends vertically for about an inch on the left side of the vertebral column ; it is covered by peritoneum in front and laterally, and refavmed in position by a bundle of muscular fibres descending from the leftTHE JEJUNUM AND ILEUM. 271 cms of the diaplu-agm, and known as tlxe musculus suspensoriiis duodeni. From its termination tlie jejunum is continued down- wards at an acute angle. The enti-ance of the -pevitoneal fossa duodeno-jejunalis (p. 257) lies opposite the junction of the duodenum and jejmuun. This is the most fixed portion of the small intestine ; and, owing to the weight of the remainder of the bowel, it is at the junction of the duodenum Fig. 137. with the jejunum that laceration most c .mmonly occurs in cases 01 abclommal injury.

The commencement of the ileum is arbitrarily fixed at the junction of the second with the third fifth of the length of the conjoint tube. A foetal relic, representing the omphalo-mesenteric duct, and known as MecM's diverticulum, is occasionally found as a nanw tube, from half an inch to five or six inches in length, opening into the ileum at a distance of eighteen inches to three feet from the ileo-csecal valve. If long it may rim upwards to the umbilicus. The Pancreas (Fig. 139) lies transversely m the abdomen, occupying the epigastric and left hjiJochondriac regions, and is subdivided into a head, body, and tail. The head is embraced by the duodeniun, and sends a process downwards and inwards behind the superior mesenteric vessels ; the hodi), which is concave posteriorly, crosses the aorta and left kidney opposite the 1st lumbar vertebra ; and the tail runs in the gastro-splenic omentum, to come in contact with the lower and back part of the visceral siu-face of the spleen. The median sagittal plane cuts through the neck and the lower process of the head. It is related //; front with the posterior layer of the lesser sac of peritoneum, and near its lower border with the attachment of the transverse meso-colon; and more anteriorly is covered by the stomach except over a small projection from its upper border, the omentale, which rises above the lesser curve o the organ to reach the lesser omentum.

The Large Intestine is a wide sacculated tube adapted for the retention and final digestion of feecal matter, and averages about six feet in length. It commences in the right iliac fossa and ter- minates at the anus, and is subdivided into three segments :—The C^cum or Caput csecum coli, the Colon, and the Eectum. The C'cEcum is a short but capacious cul-de-sac, averaging about 2^ inches in length, and lying below the point at which the ileum opens into the large intestine. It has a complete peritoneal cover- ing, and presents at its lower and back part a little appendage, the appendix vermiformis. It usually lies in the right iliac fossa, in contact heUnd with the psoas and iliacus and iliac fascia, the external cutaneous nerve, and the vermifoi-m appendage; anteriorly it reaches the abdominal waU, and might be exposed by an incision on a level with the anterior superior iliac spine, but it vai-ies greatly in position in different subjects and under different con- ditions, sometimes extending downwards and inwards along Poupart's ligament, towards or even beyond the median line, at others terminating two or three inches below the iliac crest. It may be overlapped partially or completely by coils of ileum if undistended. On its inner side are the small intestines and the junction with the ileum. The Appendix Vermiformis is a blind tiibular prolongation of the diameter of a goose-quill, averaging about foui- inches in length, but ranging from one to six inches; it most commonly runs upwai-ds and inwards, but may assume any direction. It is sm-- rounded by peritoneum and provided with a small mesentery. The Colon is subdivided into four parts, ascending, transverse, descending, and sigmoid flexure. Its entire length ranges from 3^ to 6i feet, and averages about 4^ feet (Treves). The CEBCum and colon are distinguished from the rest of the mtes- tines by the pecuHar sacculation caused by the shortness of the longi- tudinal fibres of the muscular coat and theii- arrangement m three bands or tanioi, and the colon presents in addition Uttle fatty appen- dages called appendices epiphica;, attached opposite one of the tjenife. The ascending colon is usually covered with peritoneum only in front and at the sides. It begins in the right iliac fossa above the level of the anterior superior iliac spine, and runs upwards, crossing the iliac crest a littie to the inner side of its mid-pomt, to reach the internal lameUa of the posterior tendon of the transversalis (over the quadratus lumborum). Continuing its course, it passes m front of the right kidney external to the second part of the duodenum, reaches the inn.^r surface of the right lobe of the liver, forming the hepatic flexure, and is succeeded by the transverse colon.275 THE LARGE INTESTINE, The transverse colon is invested by peritoneum derived from both sacs, and rnns in a curved direction inwards, forwards, and slightly downwards to the anterior abdominal wall opposite the umbilicus (but is sepai-ated from it by the anterior double layer of the great omentum); thence outwards, backwards and upwards to the lower end of the spleen, where it bends to form the splenic flexure. The descending colon begins below the splenic flexure, and like the ascending colon is usually bound down to the posterior abdominal wall without the intervention of a mesentery; it passes downwards over the front of the left kidney, the transversaKs tendon, and the crest of the ilium, about an inch to the inner side of its mid-point, to enter the iliac fossa. The gut then developes a mesentery and becomes known as the sigmoid flexure. The sigmoid flexure resembles the rest of the colon in its general characters, but is invested by peritoneum along its whole leno-th, and is fixed to the abdominal wall by a meso-colon. It first runs downwards and forwards, reaching the anterior abdominal wall on the inner side of the anterior superior spme of the ilium, thence passes backwards into the true pelvis, turning upon itself in an S-like form, at length loses its mesentery opposite the third sacral vertebra, and becomes continuous with the rectum at a point arbitrarily but somewhat indefinitely fixed at the left sacro-iliac joint. The Rednm is 8 or 9 inches in length and extends from the left sacro-iliac joint to the anus. It is divided into thi-ee portions, the fii'st, 4 or 5 inches in length, reaching as far as the third piece of the saci-um; the second, 3 inches long, passing to the tip of the coccyx ; and the third, about an inch in length, ending at the anal apertm-e. It is characterised by the absence of sacculation owing to the distribution of the longitudinal fibres of its muscular coat around the whole circumference of the gut, but there is no definite point at which this change of arrangement takes place. The first Vortmui^ continuous with the sigmoid flexm'e, and is connected to the back of the pelvis by the same mesentery. Behind it are the left pyrifoi-mis and sacral plexus, and the left internal iliac arterv with Its branches ; and the left ureter is behind and to the loft o> this part of the bowel; in front is the small intestine fillino- in the rccto-vosical pouch.

The bile duct at first lies between the layers of the lesser omentum to the right of the hepatic artery and 2)ortal vein, then passes behind the first portion of the duodenum to join the pancreatic duct, and open into the second portion of the duodenum. The Vena Portae (Fig. 140, 3) is formed to the right of the median line by the junction of the splenic and superior mesenteric veins, behind the upper border of the jjancreas about an inch and a half from its right extremity, and immediately in front of the vena cava. It is four inches long, and ascends between the layers of the lesser omentum to the transverse fissure of the liver, between, but jjosterior to, the bile duct and the hepatic artery. It receives the small gastric pyloric and cystic veins, and like its tributaries has no valves. The Spleen [Fig. 137, 4) is a somewhat flattened organ of oval outHne and pm'ple coloiu-, occupying the back of the left hypochon- chium. Its long axis is obHque and corresponds to that of the 10th rib. It is attached to the greater end of the stomach by the gastro- splenic omentum, and to the diaphragm by the lieno-phrenic liga- ment. Its parietal surface is in contact with the diaphi'agm. Its vincmd sm-face is divided by a ridge into two parts, the posterior of which is applied to the outer border of the left kidney and supra- renal capsule; while the anterior and larger lies in contact with the stomach, the tail of the pancreas, and the splenic flexure of the colon, and presents a Jiiiuin pierced by the splenic vessels. Its iiidcriov horilcr is usually notched, the posterior entire, but this is not invariable. Its upper extmnity apjjroaches the spinal column and touches the left supra-renal capsule, its lower extremity reaches the posterior axillary line and is supported by the costo-colic fold of peritoneum. Its weight averages six ounces, but varies greatly. It IS completely invested by the greater sac of peritoneum, except at the hUum, where the serous membrane is reHeoted upon the i^plenic vessels, and where a small portion of the lesser sac may separate the two layers of the greater sac and come into contact with the inner suiiace of the organ (Fig. 128).

The vena cava and a part of the liver uncovered by peritoneum will now be exposed, the latter being attached to the diaphragm by areolar tissue; and when this is carefully divided, the right suprarenal capsule and the top of the right kidney will be brought into view. The vena cava must be cut through at the upper and again at the lower margin of the posterior surface of the liver, when it wiU only be necessary to divide the under layer of the coronary ligament (derived chiefly from the lesser sac of the peritoneum) to remove the organ. The viscera should all be placed in a covered pan, for examination during the time that the subject is turned. The diaphragm is to be cleaned by stripping off the peritoneum, as far as possible in the direction of the muscular fibres; and at the same time the inner surface of the flap of abdominal muscles still attached should be cleaned, in order to follow out the fibres of the transversalis. Oare must be taken toavoid puncturing thediaphragm, and to preserve the branches of artery and nerve ramifj^ing on its surface. The crura or muscular slips on each side of the aorta must be cleaned, and two tendinous arches over the psoas and quadratus lumborum muscles defined, for which pui-pose it will be well to detach one kidney and tiu-n it over to the opposite side temporarily.] The Diaphrag-m (Fig. 141) is an arched muscle, concave towards the abdomen ; this concavity is exaggerated after death, owing to the fact that expiration is the last act of life. It rises to the level of the fifth costal cartilage at its junction with the sternum on the right side, and to that of the sLxth on the left-. It arises from the back of the ensiform cartilage; from the innei- surfaces of the cartilages of the six lower ribs, where it interdigitates with the transversal! s abdominis ; from the internal and external arcuate ligaments, which cross the psoas and quadratus lumborum muscles respectively; and by its crura from the lumbar vertebrse and intervertebral discs. The liyamentum arcuatum externum (5) is a fibrous arch extending from the transverse process of the first (occasionally the second) lumbar vertebra to the tip of the last rib. It crosses the upper part of the quadratus lumborum; giving attachment above to the muscular fibres of the diaphragm, and below to the antenor lamella of the posterior tendon of the transversalis and to the fascia tiuus- versalis. The liijmneiifinii arriiutum internum (6) is a similar arch running from the side of the bodv of the first lumbar vertebra over the psoas, to become attached to the tip of the first or occasionally the279 THE DIAPHRAGM. second lumbar transverse process. It gives attachment to muscular fibres above and to the fascia iliaca below. The crura or pillars of the diaphragm (8) arise from the front of the bodies and intervertebral discs of the four upj^er lumbar vertebi'JB, and usually from a mesial fibrous arch over the aorta; the right crus is the larger, and extends as low as the disc between the PiK. 141. thud and fom-th lumbar vertebra, while the left crus (lo) reaches to the third disc. All the fibres of the diaphragm are inserted into a central tendon, called from its shape the rordi/orm or trefoil tendon (i, 2, 3), but the mner fibres of the crui-a decussate with one another and form Fig. 141.—Under or abdominal surface of the diapliragm (from Wilson). 1.

The right leaflet of the tendon is the largest. The pericardium is attached to the upper surface of the diaphragm, partly to the tendon and partly to the muscular fibres connected with the left leaflet, and aids in the upward fixation of the summit of the dome. Openings.—There are three large openings in the diaphragm, for the Aorta, the CEsophagus, and the Vena Cava; and small orifices in the crura for the splanchnic nerves, one in the left crus for the vena azygos minor, and one in the light crus for the vena azygos major, if this vessel does not pass through the aortic opening- The Aortic and CEsophagml openings are formed by the fibres of the crura. The anterior or oesophageal opening, which is slightly to the left side, is entirely muscular; but that for the aorta will be found upon dissection to be bounded by the internal tendinous fibres of the two crura, and usually by a fibrous arch between these. The aortic opening is strictly speaking behind the diaphragm, as it is completed posteriorly by the vertebral column. The opening for the Vena Cava is entii-ely tendinous. It is more or less quadrilateral {foramen, quadratmn), and is situated in the right division of the cordiform tendon. Through the aortic orifice pass the aorta, the vena azygos major, and the thoracic duct: through the aisophageal opening, the oeso- phagus with the two pneumogastric nerves; through the (■</(■(// opening, the vena cava inferior (which is firmly attached to the margins of the apertm-e), and also a branch of the phrenic nerve. The greater and lesser splanchnic nerves pierce the crus on each side, and the vena azygos minor passes through the left crus. The gangliated cord of the sympathetic is continued into the abdomen from the thorax beneath the ligamentum arcuatum internum. The costo-xiphoid space on each side, between the sternal and costal origins of the muscle, transmits the superior epigasti-ic vessels and some cellular tissue. It is sometimes the seat of a hernia. ^rf/o,i._The diaphragm is essentially a n\uscle of inspuatioii. It acts partly by the straightening of its curved fibres, so augmentmg the space between it and the lower part of the chest waU; and partly by elevating the ribs to which it is attached. Its tendon probably does not descend to any material degree, but it opposes a passive resistance to the upward pressui-e of the abdominal viscera dming the contraction of the abdominal muscles. The diaiihragm ia supplied bv the phrenic nerves from the cervical plexus, which, after traversing the thorax, pierce the fibres of the muscle and ai-o distributed principally on its under surface. Its arteries, the phrentc,THE ABDOMINAL AORTA. 281 fi-om the abdominal aorta, on the under surface, and the muscnlo- p/imiic and iviiits neni phrenici from the internal mammary, anastomose with some of the intercostal arteries.

Aroimd the aorta and its branches will be found the sym- pathetic nerve givmg off plexuses to the several vessels. The greater part of this may be removed, but the great splanchnic nerves should be traced from the points where they pierce the crura of the dia- phragm to their terminations in the semilunar ganglia These ganglia are large masses of a pinkish colour, situated on each side ot the aorta close to the diaphragm ; the right lies beneath the vena cava and it will therefore be necessary to turn down this vessel for a short distance m order to expose it; they closely resemble lymphatic glands m appearance, and are connected by numerous nerves sur- roimding the coeliac axis and constituting the solar plexus. The gaughated cord of the sympathetic on each side of the vertebras is to be preserved The vena cava inferior (a piece of which it will be remembered has been removed with the liver) is to be cleaned, and care must be taken not to cut off the right spermatic vein on its anterior surface. The vein may be secured in its proper position with a pin If necessary The kidneys and supra-renal capsules are snprn.n'il-r /°i^^ the vessels going to each defined; and the spermatic vessels should be ti-aced out.] Sympathetic Nerve.-On each side of the aorta" and close to the crura of the diaphragm will be seen a pinkish body of a some- what crescentic form, called the semilunar ganglion (Fi<.- 137 12) and into it may be traced the great splanchnic nerve from the thoracic ganglia. The HoUiv phxas is formed by fibres crossing from one semilunar gaiighon to the other, around the ccehac axis and superior mesen- teric artery and between the supra-renal capsules, and receives a toanch from the right pneumogastric. Its continuation, the uurtk P^^xn, will have been more or less seen in cleaning the aorta, and so a^so the secondary plexuses derived from it and distributed upon the severa branches, viz., the phrenic, gastric, hepatic, splenica superior mesenteric supra-renal, renal, spermatic, and i„f..ri„r mesciitoric plexuses.

It is ensheathed by sub-peritoneal connective tissue, in whicli are lymphatic glands and more or less fat; and is closely invested by the solar and aortic sympathetic plexuses. It is covered in front by the liver, stomach, transverse colon, intestines, and peri- toneum, and, in more immediate contact, by (1) the pancreas, with the splenic vein near its upper border, (2) the left renal vein, (3) the transverse duodenum, and (4) the branches which spring from its anterior aspect. Behind are the bodies of the lumbar vertebra' and their ligaments, and the left lumbar veins. To its riyht is the right crus of the diaphragm, and the vena cava lies in close contact below, but is separated from it above by an angular interspace : and deeply placed between the upper part of the aorta and the right crus are the receptaculum chyli and thoracic duct, and the vena azygos major; the great splanchnic nerve may either run through the aortic opening or pierce the right crus. To the left are the left gangliated cord of the sympathetic, the left crus of the diaphi-agm, the splanchnic nerves, and, perhaps, the commencement of the vena azygos minor. Its point of bifurcation, though often in the middle line, and occasionaUy a little to the right side, is usually a Uttle below and to the left of the umbiHcus, above which pomt it may be compressed. .

In the foetus they are as large as the renal arteries. In addition to this artery {middle, capsidar), the capsule is supplied by a branch from the phrenic (superior) and one from the renal artery (infeiior). The right rein enters the vena cava, the left the renal vein of its side. The Renal arteries (Fig. 143, g) ari.se on each side of the aorta immediately below the capsular arteries, about haK an inch below the superior mesenteric artery, and opposite the lower border of the first lumbar vertebra (the right usually a little lower than the left). They run ti-ansversely to the concave border of the kidney, the right going behind the vena cava. The aorta being a little to the left of the middle line at this point, the right renal artery is necessarily slightly longer than the left, while, owing to the position of the vena cava on the right of the column, the right renal vein is much shorter than the left. The renal artery, after giving of¥ a small inferior rcqjsidar twig, breaks up into three or four branches ju.st as it enters the kidney : one or more of these may pass in front of the vein, and occasionally a branch may run behind the ureter, or may pierce the kidney above or below the hilum, but as a rule the relation of the parts at the hilum of the kidney is (1) Vein, (2) Artery, (3) Ureter, from before backwards. An additional renal artery not infi-e- quently arises from the lower part of the aorta, or from the common iliac artery, and occasionally more than one such vessel is present. It is important for the surgeon -to bear in mind these and other possible variations in the arterial supply in operations upon the Iddney. The renal or emulgent veins open into the vena cava, the left crossing in front of the aorta immediately below the superior mesenteric artery, and receiving the left spermatic and supra-renal veins. The Spermatic arteries (Fig. 143, 10) are two long slender branches, which arise from the front of the aorta about an inch below the renal, and pass downwards behind the peritoneum to the internal abdominal ring, and through the inguinal canal to the testes. The right courses obliquely over the vena cava (sometimes behind it) and each crosses the psoas, the genito-cnmil nerve, and the ureter, ami near Poupart's ligament the external iliac vessels • then entering the internal inguinal ring to the outer side of the deep epigastric vessels, traverses the inguinal canal, to emerge at the external ring and enter the scrotum. the female the spermatic artenes become the ovarian, and pass into the pelvis to ramif^^ inDEEP DISSECTION OF ABDOMEN. 286 the broad ligament of the uterus (Fig. 162, i). One small twig accompanies the round ligament to the ingiiinal canal, another runs along the Fallopian tube, and a third supplies part of the uterus, anastomosing with the uterine branch of the internal iliac. The spermatic veins form a plexus aroimd the arteries {pampini- form 2->lexus). They take a different course on the two sides, the left opening at a right angle into the left renal vein, and the right running obUquely into the vena cava. This arrangement is said to account in part for the more freqxient occui-rence of 'varicocele' on the left side, but Dr. J. H. Brinton, of Philadelphia, fm-nishes a better explanation by demonstrating the existence of a valve at the caval orifice of the right vein, while there is none at the entrance of that of the left side into the renal. The left vein, moreover, is liable to compression by accumulated ffeces in the sigmoid flexure, which lies in front of it. . i , i.^. The great length of the spermatic arteries is explained by the fact that the testicles were originally in the abdomen, opposite the point where the arteries arise, and that as they descended the vessels necessarily became elongated. The Inferior Mesenteric artery (Fig. 143, 12) arises opposite the third lumbar vertebra, a little to the left of the middle of the fi-ont of the aorta, and supplies the lower half of the large mtestine ((.. p. 263) by its left colic, sigmoid, and superior haemoiThoidal branches. Its vein opens into the splenic vein. The Middle Sacral {sacral aorta) (Fig. 143, 18) is a small branch arising at the bifurcation of the aorta, and passing down into the pelvis along the middle of the sacrum. It anastomoses with the lateral sacral branches of the internal iliac arteries. The corresponding vein opens into the left common iHac vein. The Lumbar arteries (Fig. 143, 14), usually fom- m number on each side, arise in a double row fi'om the back of the aorta, and pass transversely, close upon the vertebra., beneath the psoas and the gangUated cords of the sympathetic, and on the right . de benetth the vena cava. The upper arteries also pa^s under the crura of the diaphragm, where those bridge over the nariwor portions of the bodies of the vertebrre. Only small P-tion. 0 fhese arteries can be seen at present, but when followed out each will be found to divide into an anterior and a P^^^^^^^^^: The avterior branch runs between the abdominal muscles, to .upph them, and to anastomose with the lower intercostal epigastric and circumflex iliac arteries.

The lumbar reins, three or four for each side, open into the inferior vena cava. They are connected opposite the transverse processes of the vertebrte by a vertical vessel, the ascending Imnhar vein, which forms the radicle of the azygos veins. The Common Iliac Arteries (Fig. 145, G) are the dii^ect continuations of the abdominal aorta, and extend from the bifui-- cation at the fom-thlumbar vertebra to the lumbo-sacral articulation, where each divides into the external and internal iliac arteries! The right common iliac is usually a little longer than the left; and the relations difPer on the two sides, owing, principally, to the fact that the two common iliac veins unite to form the vena cava on the right side of the vertebral column. Both arteries rest on the vertebral column, covered in front by the peritoneimi, and are usually crossed near their termination by the ureters, but the left is crossed in addition by the rectum and superior htemorrhoidal vessels, and the right by the termination of the ileum and the lowest branch of the superior mesenteric artery. The left artery rests against the psoas magnus, while the right artery lies upon its own vem below and crosses the vein of the opposite side above. The only branches from the trunks are small twigs to the iliacus muscles and to the ureter. Common Iliac Veins.—The left common iliac vein will be seen to He to the inner side of its own artery, and then to pass beneath the right artery to reach the vena cava, whilst the right vein is at first behind and then to the outer side of the right artery until it imites with the left. Thus both the veins He to the right of their respective arteries, and the commencement of the vena cava is immediately to the right of, or sometimes even sHghtly behind, the Fig. 14.5.-The Iliac and Femoral Arteries (from Maclise's Surgical Anatomy).

They receive tlie lateral sacral and ilio- Itimbar veins, and the middle saci-al vein enters the left common iliac. Tlie Vena Cava Inferior (Fig. 143, 3) lies ensheathed in subperitoneal tissue to the right of the aorta. It is in close relation to it below, but is separated from it by an angular interval above, and there lies in a more anterior plane. It is fonned by the junction of the two common iliac veins on the right of the fifth lumbar vertebra, and keeps to the right of the vertebral column as high as the liver; where it passes somewhat forward, entering a deep groove (occasionally converted into a canal by a bridge of hepatic substance) between the lobus Spigelii and the right lobe proper, and receives the hepatic veins; finally it reaches the quadi'ilateral opening in the diaphragm. In front of it are the peritoneum (with the foramen of Winslow), the duodenum, the pancreas, the liver, the portal vein, and the right spermatic artery. Behind lie the vertebral column, the right crus of the diaphragm, a portion of the right supra-renal capsule, the right capsular, phrenic, renal, supra-renal, and lumbar arteries, and the sympathetic chain of ganglia, besides occasionally the bridge of hepatic siibstance '{2->onticulus) mentioned above. To the right, and in close contiguity, lie the right kidney and ureter and the greater part of the supra- ■ renal capsule; to the Uft, the aorta, the thoracic duct, the com- mencement of the vena a^^ygos major, and the solar plexus and ri-ht semilunar ganglion. It receives the lumbar, right spermatic, renal, right supra-renal, and right phi'enic veins, and as it passes through the liver the larger hepatic veins open into it: thus it returns the whole of the blood of the abdomen and lower extremities to the heart. •, . xi. • <- The External Iliac Artery (Fig. 145, I) reaches from the pomt of bifurcation of the common iliac to Poupart's Hgament, where it becomes the femoral, its direction corresponding with a line di-awn from the umbilicus to a point midway between the s^miphysis pubis and the anterior superior iHac spine. It passes along the biim ot the true pelvis and upon the psoas muscle, invested by a process ot subperitoneal tissue which includes both it. and the vein, and must be removed in order to expose them. The crural branch of he oenito-crural nerve lies close to the outer side of the artery, and tlie o-cnital branch of the same nerve, as well as the spei-matic vessels and deep circumflex iUac vein cross in front of it near PouP^^; ^ Ucament. Occasionally the ureter crosses the upper part ot tlie artery. The vein Ues to the inner side of the artery in the whole of its course upon the left side, but is beneath its upper part on theTHE KIDNEY. 289 right side; and, close to Poupart's ligament, the vas deferens or round ligdinent hooks around the epigastric artery, and descends into the pelvis to the inner side of the external iUac trunk. Like the aorta and common iliac arteries it is ensheathed by Bubiieritoneal connective tissue, and thi'ee compartments may be demonstrated in the sheath as 'well as in that of the femoral artery, with which it is in continuity :—an external compartment for the artery, a middle for the vein, and an internal, less well defined, for a chain of Ijinphatic glands and vessels. Branches.—The deep epigastric and the deep circumflex iliac arteries are usually given off just above Pouj^art's Hgament, but occasionally are found on a level with the ligament, or even springing from the common femoi'al below it. The Epigastric artery passes inwards and upwards immediately outside the peritoneum, and pierces the fascia transversalis to enter the rectus muscle at its posterior aspect, to which it has been already traced (p. 238). Its relation to the vas deferens and round ligament is mentioned above. The branches of the epigastiic are pubic to the back of the pubic bone, crcmusteric to the cord, and musculnr. An abnormal branch of large size is frequently fo\ind coming off fi'om the epigastric close to its origin, and descending into the pelvis; this is the obturator artery, which may run on the inner side of the neck of a femoral hernia. The epiijastric rein joins the external iliac vein. The Circumflex Iliac artery takes a course outwards along Poupart's ligament, and lies at first immediately outside the peritoneum. It soon, however, pierces the transversalis fascia and miiscle, and riins along the crest of the iliimi between the muscles, to anastomose with the ilio-lumbar branch of the internal iUac, with the last lumbar, and with the superficial cu'cumflex iliac arteries. It gives upwards a large branch, which is foiuid between the Internal Oblique and Transversalis, and which anastomoses with the lumbar and lower intercostal arteries. The rei)t has been seen to cross the external iliac aitery an inch above Poup;u't's Hgament, to open into the external iUnc vein. The Kidneys arc a pair of bean-shaped organs, each measuring about 4^ inches in length, 21, inches in In-eadth, and an inch and a fluartcr in thickness, and weighing about 4^ ounces.

It is covered in front by the fascia transversalis. The fascia iliaca or ilio-psoas fascia ensheaths the psoas and ihacus. The fascia over the j>soas is attached to the lower edge of the ligamentum arcuatum internum of the diaphragm, and to the vertebrte fi-om which the muscle takes its origin, and joins the fascia over the iliacus below. The fascia coverimj the iliacus infenius muscle is attached above to the inner lip of the iliac crest, and is continuous below with the fascia over the psoas magnus. The conjoint sheath should be traced beneath Poupart's ligament, where it passes behind the sheath of the femoral vessels to reach the insertion of the muscle {v. p. 120). The Psoas Magnus muscle (Fig. 149, 6) arises by five slips from the sides of the intervertebral discs between the last thoracic and all the lumbar vertebra?, and from the adjacent parts of the bodies and roots of the transverse processes of these vertebrre; and between these slips from a series of tendinous arches crossing the constricted portion of the bodies of the four npper lumbar vertebra'. The muscle passes along the border of the true pelvis in close relation to the iliac vessels, and disappears beneath Poupart's ligament to be inserted by a tendon into the ajiex of the lesser trochanter of the femur. The Psoas Parvus (Fig. 149, 4) is a small miiscle occasionally found upon the front of the psoas magiurs. It arises in front of the upper slip of the psoas magnus, from the bodies of the last thoracic and first lumbar vertebrno, and from the intervening disc; and ends in a long tendon which is inserted into the ilio-pectineal eminence and part of the ilin-pectineal line, and gives an expansion to the iliac fascia. The Iliacus Internus (Fig. 149, 8) arises from the upper half of the iliac fossa, reaching the margins of the crest, iliac notch, and anterior inferior iliac spine ; from the upper surface of the ala of the sacrum ; from the anterior sacro-iHac and ilio-lumbar ligaments •294 DEEP DISSECTION OF ABDOMEN. and, frequently, from the capsular ligament of the hip-joint. Its fleshy fibres unite with the tendon of the psoas, and arc inserfed with it into the lesser trochanter, and into the shaft for abovrt an inch below. A bursa lies beneath the conjoined muscle between it and the capsule of the hip, and may communicate with the joint cavity by a round apertiure between the iUo-femoral and pubo-femoral bands. The psoas and the iliacus are flexors and externai rotators ot tJie thigh and taking theii- fixed point below are flexors and rotators of the trunk upon the thigh. This is seen in dislocation of the femur downwards into the thyroid foramen, when the boaj^ is always bowed forwards owing to the tension of these muscles, ihe psoas is supplied by the lumbar nerves, the iliacus by intra-pelvic branches of the anterior crural nerve. , , , i The auadratus Lumborum (Eig. 149, 5) is the short muscle filling the space between the last rib and the crista ilii. It has its origin below, from the posterior portion of the mner lip of the crest of the ilium and from the adjacent ilio-lumbar bgament; and ascends to be inserted into the lower border of the last rib, and by three or four sUps into the tips of the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebra,.

It crosses the iliacus obliquely to the anterior superior spinous process, close to which it passes'under Poupart's ligament to supply the outer side of the thigh nearly as low as the knee. (This sometimes comes from the anterior cruxal nerve, and is then nearly transverse in its direction.) The Anterior Crural (23) is a large nerve close to the outer border of the psoas at its lower part, and lies between that muscle and the iliacus, giving branches to the latter and usually also to the femoral artery. It passes under Poupart's ligament into the thigh. The Obturator nerve (25) vviU be better dissected with the pelvis, but may be seen passing below the brim of the true pelvis upon the upper fibres of the obturator internus above the obturator vessels, to disappear through the upper part of the thyroid foramen. A small Areesoory Obturator nerve is occasionally found arising with the obturator nerve. It passes over the body of the os pubis joining the obturator nerve on the inner side of the tliigh, and supplying twigs to the pectineus aud the hip-joint. [The psoas should be carefully removed piecemeal on one side in order to dissect the hunbar nerves to then- origins, and to trace out plexus completely. The gangliated cord of the sympathetic can now be fuUy seen, and should be cleaned.] The Lumbar plexus wiU now be seen to be formed by the anterior divisions of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and part of the -Ith lumbar nerves with a branch fi-om the 12th thoracic; the remainder of the-ith joiningwith the oth to form the "lumbo-sacralcord.

A ganglion is situated opposite each vertebra, and gives off a number of branches, which may be divided into (1) those communicating with the ganglia above and below; (2) those communicating with the spinal nerves, which are often two in number, and accompany the lumbar arteries beneath the tendinous arches of the psoas; (3) branches to the plexuses upon the neighbouring arteries supplying the viscera and the vertebrae and bgaments. Some Ji/mphatic ylaiuh (Jumhar) may also be found sm-rounding the great vessels. They receive the lymphatics from the testis in the male, from the ovary and Fallopian tube in the female, from the Uiac and sacral glands, and from the ascending or descending colon. A few renal lymphatic glands are found above the renal vessels. The Vena Azygos Major may be seen lying close to the right side of the aorta, and communicating with two or more of the lumbar veins, and sometimes with the vena cava or right renal. It passes through the aortic opening. The Vena Azygos Minor may be seen to commence in the left lumbar veins or from the left renal, and to pass through the left cms of the diaphi'agm. Receptaculum Chyli.—By detaching the right crus of the diaphragm from the vertebrae, and if necessary, removing a piece of the aorta opposite the upper lumbar vertebrae, the receptaculum chyli, the dilated origin of the thoracic duct, will be seen lying between and behind the aorta and vena cava, opposite the second lumbar vertebra. It receives all the lymphatics and lacteals of the abdomen, and is continued upwards as the thoracic duct. The subject will now be turned for the dissection of the back, and the dissectors of the abdomen should occupj- the time with the examination of the viscera.

Its coats are four in number—serous, muscular, areolar, and mucous. The serous coat is continuous with the lesser omentum above, with the great omentum below, and with the gastro-splenic omentiun on the left side ; the layer in fi'ont of the stomach is derived from the greater sac, and that behind from the lesser sac of the peritoneum.

The circular fibres, which are next in order, enclose the entire viscus, and are collected together at the small end to iovm the pylorus. The oblique fibres, continuous with the circular fibres of the oesophagus, may be exposed by everting the viscus and dissecting away the mucous membrane; they are distributed principally over the great end of the stomach, and are so arranged around the cardiac orifice as to form a " button-hole " sphincter, one set of fibres crossing the right side of the opening to spread out on either sui'face towards the left extremity of the viscus, the other in like manner crossing the left border of the opening to reach the more central portion of the greater cm've. The arroJnr or sub-mucous coat consists of areolar tissue, in which ramify the blood-vessels and a rich lymphatic plexus, and between this and the mucous coat is a thin layer of involuntary muscle, the ■muscularis mucosae. On laying o'pen the stomach along its lesser cmwature, the mucous memhritne will be seen to be arranged in longitudinal folds or ridges called rugce, which disappear when the viscus is distended, and are more evident in the child than in the adult. By inverting the pyloric end, the pyloric sphincter will be seen as a prominent ring of strong circular fibres, surrounding the intestiiie beneath the mucous membrane, and acting as a sphincter muscle. The mucous membrane is thick and soft, and of a pink colour' when recent; it is thickest near the pylorus and thinnest at the greater end, where perforation from jDOst-mortem digestion usually takes place. The surface of the membrane is divided into a series of shallow alveoli, more or less hexagonal in form (stomach cells), at the bottom of which open the tubes which secrete the gastric juice and mucus. ' Solitary glands' or lymphoid follicles are scattered over the surface of the gastric mucous membrane. The Small Intestine is described on page 269. It maj' be regarded as a tortuous and greatly elongated conical cylinder, the smaller end of which opens into the ctecum. It has four coats, viz. peritoneal, muscular (longitudinal and circuLir), areolar, and mucous. The jieritoneal coat completely surrounds the first part of the duodenum, except at the attachment of the lesser omentum, where the vessels enter; while the second and third portions a.re only covered on their anterior surfaces, and even this investment is incomplete where the second part of the tube is crossed by the attachment of the transverse meso-colon, and the third portion by the .superior mesenteric vessels. The peritoneal covering of the jejunum and ileum is wanting only at the point of attachment of the mesentery, where the musculariH of about a fifth or a sixth ofTHE ABDOMINAL VISCERA. 300 the gut foiTiiH the base of the interserous triangle (Pig. 138). The muscvihir cocat consists of an external layer of longitudinal fibres and an internal thicker layer of circular fibres, both complete and continiious. The mucous membrane is amplified in extent of sur- face by plications called valvulse conniventes, by papillary projec- tions called villi, and by follicular involutions known as tubes of Lieberkiihn; and its thickness diminishes progi-essively, together with the cahbre of the gut, as it becomes more remote fi-om the stomach and approaches the ciecum. Eacemose glands (Brunner's) are found in the upper part of the duodenum, and aggregations of lymphoid follicles chiefly in the ileum, while solitary Ijonphoid foUides are scattered throughout the intestine. A musculan's mucosce is present in the submucous tissue, as in the stomach, and enters into the formation of both the villi and valvulse conniventes. The valvalce couniL'eiiti'S (or valves of Kerkring) are transverse folds of mucous membrane and submucous tissue, which wiU. be seen to commence about the middle of the second stage of the duodenran, and to increase in size as they approach the middle of the jejvinimi; below this point they become smaller, disappearing in the lower foxu-th of the ileum. They extend around about two-thirds of the circiimference of the gut. The Villi are minute projections from the surface of the mucous membrane, and give it a velvety appearance, which may be best seen by floating a piece of intestine in water. They begiii at the pyloric sphincter and end at the ileo-ctecal valve, and attain their greatest length (about j^th of an inch) where the vahiilfp conni- ventes are most developed. Each viUus is a prolongation of the mucous membrane, formed of lymphoid tissue and covered with columnar epithelium. It contains in its centre a single or double lacteal, surrounded by a delicate layer of involuntary niuscle prolonged from the muscular is mucosa;; externally to which is a capillary plexus, with the basement-membrane on which the epithelium rests. rjehcrkiihrs follicles are minute tubes lined with colmnuar epithelium, and common to the whole of the small mtestuies. They are placed between the villi, and dip into the submucous areolar tissue, their depth being proportionate to the thickness ot the membrane. . 14. +1, The Solitary follicles are seen as white round bodies about tne size of millet seed, containing a milky fluid. They consist ot lymphoid tissue, and are found in the whole length of the digestive tract, but are most numerous where the multiplication of surface is least.THE ILEUM. 301 Bruiintr^s glands, peculiar to the upper f)art of the duodenum, are small racemose glands situated iu the submucous areolar tissue and opening into the intestine by minute ducts. To see these it is necessarj' to pin out a jiiece of duodenum with the mucous membrane downwards, and then carefully to dissect away the muscular coat. The Duodenum (Fig. loO) should be laid open along its free border, in order to see the common oj)ening of the bile and jDan- creatic ducts, which is marked by a papilla situated at the back of the second portion of the intestine, and about or below its middle (13). A second opening, the accessory duct of Suntorini, connected with the lesser pancreas, may sometimes be fomid above this part. A probe should be passed thi'ough the papilla into the common bile duct and along the pancreatic duct. The duodenum is the widest and thickest portion of the small intestine, and is characterised structm-ally by the presence of Brunner's glands in the mucous membrane of its upper segment. It contains also valvulse conniventes, villi, Lieberkiihnian tubes, and solitary follicles. [The jejimum and ileum (except a few inches to be left attached to the csecum) should be laid open along the line of attachment of the mesentery, in order to avoid damaging Peyer's patches, which are at the opposite side of the gut.] The Jej unum, including about two-fifths of the remaining small intestine, is remarkable for the large size of the valvulre conni' ventes, the gi-eat development of the villi, and the number of sohtary follicles, but has no special characteristic. Its nominal separation from the ileiim is arbitrary and useless. In the Ileum the valvulse conniventes wiU be found to diminish rapidly in size, and to be absent altogether at the lower part. A small tube or cord may sometimes be found in connection ynth. the gut, about thi-ee feet from the ileo-ctecal valve, extending towards the lunbilicus. This is called Meckel's diverticulum, and is a relic of the vitelline duct of the foetus. Peyer's patches {(jlandukK agmfnatce) are the special characteristic of this part of the intestine, but are occasionally found in the Jejunum; they are from twenty to thirty in number, but vary much ill size and are sometimes invisible. They wiU be recognised as shallow oval or rounded depressions, dotted on their surface, and of a lighter colour than the rest of the intestine, and are alwavs found on the part of the intestine farthest from the attachment of the mesentery. Each patch consists of a collection of h-m- phoid follicles.302 THE ABDOMINAL VISCERA. The Large Intestine is remarkable in nearly the whole of its length for a pouched appearance, consequent upon the longitudinal muscular fibres being shorter than the intestine itself. Tj^ically these longitudinal fibres are arranged in three distinct bands or toinkv, two of which can be seen through the peritoneum, and the thh'd 'between the layers of the meso-colon; but in the rectum, which is not pouched, and the vermiform appendix, the fibres spread over the whole gut, as in the smaU intestine.

Fig. 151THE PANCREAS AND SPLEEN. 303 The Ileo-ccecal valve (Fig. 151, 5) is formed by a prolongation of the mucous membrane and cu'cular fibres of the muscular coat of ileum into the cavity of the cpecum, and appears as two folds boundiug a horizontal slit-like aperture of communication. The upper fold or flajD, which is horizontal in direction, is sometimes known as the ih-o-colic, and the lower or more vertical one as the ileO'CKcal fold. Two ridges, one on each side, extend from the angles of ujiion of the two folds, and are called the frana or retinacula. The valve permits the ready passage of fluid from the small into the large intestine, but opposes regurgitation. The mucous membrane of the large intestine has no villi, these ceasing abruptly at the free margin of the ileo-csecal valve, but resembles that of the small intestine in having columnar epithe- lium, tubular glands resembling the follicles of Lieberkiihn, and solitary follicles, embedded in the submucous tissue. The Pancreas (Fig. 139, and p. 272), should be cleaned, but left attached to the duodenum. It is a compoimd racemose gland, and consists of lobules of a yellowish colour held together by loose fibrous tissue, a small duct passing fi-om each lobule into the main ti-imk. A probe shordd be passed from the duodenum into the duct (canal of Wirsung), and when dissected out, will be foimd to pass along the whole length of the gland, nearer the posterior than the anterior siu-faco. A large accessory duct passes from the upper part of the head and occasionally opens separately into the duodeniun. The pancreatic duct lies close to the bUe duct, and the two pierce the duodenal wall, opening usually by a common orifice upon the summit of a small papilla. The Spleen (Fig. 139, spl) has been already figui'edand described (p. 277), and may now be removed and examined in section. Beneath the peritoneal coat which invests the organ, will be found a fibrous coat containing an abundance of unstriped muscular tissue, which is continued into the splenic substance, to form the traher.uhv or meshes in which the splenic jmlp is contained. In this pulp, which consists of a reticuliun of branched connective- tissue corpuscles (Quain), are fonnd the Malpi</hiai) corjinsdcs, small round or oval bodies attached to the miiiuto divisions of the splenic artery. They are composed of lymphoid tissue derived from a transformation of the external or areolar coat of the small arteries and average ^ inch in diameter. The arteries end in capillaries' which lose themselves in the connective tissue of the pulii in the ;nterstices of which the blood flows. The veins anastomose fi-eely in and upon the trabeculre, and open into the splenic vein.304 THE ABDOMINAL VISCERA. The Liver (Figs. 152, 153) when removed from the body loses to a very large extent the lorm which is impressed upon it by the contact of the abdominal walls and the neighbouring viscera. It presents upper and under surfaces, united by a thick posterior siu'face and a thin anterior margin. Its ordinary measairements are, twelve inches across, six from before backwards, and three inches in its greatest thickness; and its weight is from three to four pounds It is fixed to the diaphragm by peritoneal reflections, which are called respectively the superior or falciform, the posterior or coronary, and the right and left lateral ligaments, and by a fibrous cord resulting fi'om the obUteration of the umbilical vein of the fcetus, which runs to its lower surface and is known as the ' round Hgament.' The upper surface is cUvided into two unequal parts, ot Fig. 152. which the right is the larger, by the attachment of the/.W - ligament, the two layers of which will be pfstex^oriy, foi-ming the upper layer of the ^^^J^;!>T\^1^1 l■,av^en^s!

A more or less triangular interval, is thus left between the two layers of the coronary ligament, where the liver is attached to the diaphragm by cellular tissue and is in relation with the right suprarenal capsule. The upper surface of the liver is dome-shaped, and moulded to the under surface of the diaphragm and to a small portion of the anterior abdominal wall at the subcostal angle, and may be regarded as having superior anterior and right lateral faces. It is slightly depressed at its summit, where it is separated by the diaphragm from the heart (impressio cardica). The under surface (Fig. 153) presents three fissures and four lohes for examination. ^ Fissures.—The longitudinal fissure divides the imder surface into right and left lobes, and is directed obliquely fi-om a point two or three inches to the right of the sagittal plane in front, to end about an inch to the left of the plane behind. It is occupied anteriorly by the obliterated umbilical vein, and behind the transverse fissure by the cord-like relic of the ductus venosus, which lies between the two layers of the upper attached border of the septal fold of peritoneum, continuous with the left extremity of the lesser omen- tum (see p. 255). In the foetus at term the longitudinal fissure is nearly mesial and sagittal, but as growth proceeds its anterior extremity shifts graduaUy towards the right. The transverse or portal fissure, which is also obliquely directed, lies at right angles to the longitudinal; the small omentum is attached to its borders, and it gives passage to the hepatic ducts, hepatic artery, portal vein', lymphatics, and nerves, and to a connective tissue sheath for these structures derived from the capsule of Glisson. Parallel to the longitudinal fissiire but more to the right is the fossa or fissure for Wf^fyft/Z-ZVar/rfer, ashallow depression usuaUyuncoveredbyperitoneum and m direct contact with the opposed wall of the gall-bladder. Lolm.—The whole of the liver substance on the right of the longitudmal fissure is strictly the right lobe (Fig. 153), but certain parts of it have received special names, viz., the lobus quadratus the lobus Spigelii and the lobus caudatus; the surface to the rieht of these being called the 'right lobe proper.' The right lobe has three shallow depressions on its under surface, one anterior, where the ascending colon touches the liver (13), one posterior, corres- ponding to the anterior surface of the right kidney (12), over which It lies m the erect posture, and between and to the left of these neS,r XTHE ABDOMINAL VISCETiA. 306 the neck of the gall-bladder a smaU impression for the hepatic flexure of the duodenum (15). , ,, , -t. a- ^ The Lohus guadratus is a square lohe bounded by the longitudinal and transverse fissures, the gall-bladder, and the antemr border of the liver, and is often connected with the right lobe prope bv a bridge of hepatic substance {pons hepatis) across the round ligament; it is in relation with the pyloric end of the stomach and the first part of the duodenum (22).

The Lohns caiidatus (17) is a small ' tail' of liver substance wliich connects the lobus Sjiigelii with the right lobe proper, and lies behind the transverse fissui'e. It forms the upper boundarj^ of the foramen of Winslow, and is covered by the peritoneiim connecting the greater with the lesser sac. The hft luhe is on the opposite side of the longitudinal fissure. It presents a rounded prominence corresponding to the lesser omentum, the tiiher omentale (2), and around this, nearer the marginal border, a concavitj% the gastrin impressiuii (22) which is continuous with the gastric area upon the imder surface of the lobus quadratus, and with a roimded amuphac/eal notch (3), on the posterior border for the abdominal portion of the oesophagus. [The vessels entering the transverse fissure should be defined, and the fibrous tissue around them (capsule of GHsson) removed. The riyht and left hepatic ducts will be found to emerge from the corresponding lobes and to unite in the common hepatic duct, which is about two inches long; this is afterwards joined by the cystic duct from the gall-bladder and forms the common bile duct (ductus communis choledochus), a tube nearly three inches long, which should be traced into the duodenum.] The posterior surface consists of (1) a smaU portion of the left lobe, together with its aisophageal notch near the termination of the longitudijial fissui-e; (2) the greater part of the fissure for the ductus reuosus; (3) nearly the whole of the lobus Spigelii; (4) the fissure for the vena cava, with, perhaps, a iMnticulus or little bridge of hepatic substance crossing the fissure behind the vessel; (5) the portion of the righ t lole proper which Kes between the layers of the coronary ligam'ent and in direct contact with the diaphragm. It IS here that an important anastomosis occurs between the phrenic and hepatic vessels. The Lobus Spigelii'^ is an oblong lobe bounded below and in front by the transverse fissure, on the left by the fissm-e for the ductus venosus, and on the right by the fissure for the vena cava; and is connected inferiorly with the right lobe proper by the lobus candutus. Only its lower border belongs to the inferior sur- face ; the rest, looking directly backwards, presents a vertical aortic impression, and is separated from the bodies of the 10th and 11th thoracic vertebrae by the diaphragm and the thoracic aorta It is the only part of the liver that is covered by'the peritoneum of the lesser sac. ri^ sS-" - •THE ABDOMINAL VI55CERA. 308 Thefissvre for the vena mm is almost vertical, but inclines siip;htly inwards as it'descends.

The hepatic arteiy and the portal vein both divide into right and left branches, and the cystic branch should be traced to the gall- bladder from the right artery. The piece of the vena cava removed with the liver is to be laid open, when the large hepatic veins, from the right, left and Spigelian lobes, will be seen opening into it, and its coats will be found almost devoid of muscular tissue. In order to learn the arrangement of the vessels in the liver, the vena portse should be carefully opened for some distance with a'pair Fig. 155. of scissors. Through the thin wall of the vein a branch of injected nepatic artery will then be seen, and accompanying it is a branch 01 the hepatic duct, the three vessels thus lying side by side in a canal {^portal canal), bounded by an inflection of Glisson's capsule, ana containing, besides the vessels named, branches of lymphatics, nerves, and some connective tissue.

The Pelvis (Fig. 156, P) will usually be found to be subdivided into two tubular portions, the superior and inferior pelves, each of which may branch into smaller tubes, called Infnndibida, before breaking up into their terminal branches or Calices. The calices are fixed to the bottom of the sinus renalis, around little nodules of kidney substance termed ila.e papilhe. or mamilla; (c), which are the apices of the pi/ram/ds of Malpifjlii (m). These pyramids are conical in form (triangular in the section), and darker in colour Fig. 156. than the rest of the tissue, and are arranged more or less regularly side by side. They constitute what is caUed the tubular or medul- lary substance of the kidney ; the lighter granular portion or coriex lies at the margin of the section, forming a layer over the bases of the pyramids, and sending processes called Cohimvs of Beriiui [ !) between them.

Each Malpighian body is enclosed in a capsuh at the extremity of a minute uriniferous tube (i), and consists of a capillary plexus with an arterial twig (or afferent vessel) entering, and a venous radicle (or efferent vessel) leaving it, and these bodies are arranged along the arteries like bunches of currants upon a stalk. The uriniferous tube (3) connected with the capsule is convoluted in the cortical substance, and a secondary intertubular plexus is formed around it bj^ the venous radicle which emerges from the Malpighian tuft. The tube then becomes suddenly smaller, and passes for a variable distance iato the pyi-amid as the looped tube of Henle (5—g); again curving upon itself it reaches the cortex, increases in size, and opens into the collecting tiihides which represent the axial elements of the pyramids of Ferrein (13, 14). The uriniferous tubes of the pjTamids of Maljiighi, formed by the collecting tubules, con- verge at their apices, and unite to form a smaller number of larger tubes, which finally empty themselves into the calices; from these the urine passes into the infundibula, and thence into the pelvis and ureter. Between the straight tubes of the medulla are numerous recui-rent arterial branches [a. r.) from the cortico-medullary arches, and these are reinforced by straight efferent vessels from some of the deeper glomeruli. The renal artery also supplies the fibrous capsule of the kidney with branches, which anastomose with the lumbar and j^hrenic arteries. The interlobular veins, after receiving the blood from the secondary plexus on the tubes, accompany the interlobular arteries, and unite in arches at the base of the pyramids, between which they pass as the straight veins, to emerge at the hilum and form the renal or emulgent vein. On the sui-face of the kidney may be seen small venous radicles forming, from their arrangement, what are known as the »S'<«rs of Verheyen {v. s). They receive blood from the capsule of the kidney, and pass inwards to join the venous arches. The Supra-Renal Body is enclosed in a fibrous capsule, and on section will be seen to consist of two parts, cortical and medullary, the former yellowish in colour, the latter dark brown and generally broken down in the centre by decomposition so as to form a cavity. It is abundantly supplied with arterial blood from the aorta and314 THE PELVIS. from the phrenic, renal, and lumbar arteries; and its nerves are derived from the solar plexus. The form and relations have been described on p. 292. The Pelvis. The subject being replaced on its back, the dissectors should proceed with the examination of the pelvis, unless they were unable to finish the aorta, lumbar plexus, and iliac arteries before the body was turned, in which case they must revert to the dissection of them at once {v. p. 277). In any case the dissectors are strongly advised to read through the dissection of the deep parts of the abdomen again, before proceeding any further. They should, moreover, observe that the pelvic cavity bends backwards at an angle of about 110" with that of the abdomen ; that the plane of its inlet looks forwards rather than upwards, forming an angle of 150° to 155" with a vertical line striking the promontoiy of the sacrum ; and that the symphysis and sacrum are more nearly horizontal than vertical. From this strong inclination of the pelvis it follows that most of the viscera in its cavity lie above a horizontal plane at the level of the top of the symphysis, and are hence more or less accessible to palpation through the abdominal wall. [The pelvis with two lumbar vertebrae is to be separated from the trunk with the saw, when, by placing it on a table with the sacrum towards himself, the dissector will be able to get a better view ot the contents than has yet been possible. The cavity of the pelvis should be carefuUy sponged out, and the dissector should let a stream of water run through the rectum, after which the bladder should be emptied of any urine it may contain by pressui-e with the hand, and should be moderately distended with au'.] The Peritoneum (Fig. 158) should be examined first, and wiU be found in the Male to pass over the rectum, binding the upper part to the front of the sacrum {meso-redum) ; from the rectum to Fig. 158.—Side view of male pelvis (from Maolise's Surgical Anatomy).

On each side of the recto-vesical pouch it overlies the obliterated hj'pogastric arteries and the ureters, and the folds so formed are called the posterior false ligaments of the bladder. Passing from the side of the bladder to the pelvis it forms the lateral false ligaments; and the portion reaching to the back of the abdominal wall over the uj-achus is known as the superior false ligament of the bladder. Thus the false liga- ments of the bladder, five in number, are all formed by peritoneum. In the Female (Pig. 125) the peritoneum passes from the rectum to the posterior wall of the vagina, about an inch telow its attach- ment to the cervix uteri, forming the recto-vaginal pouch of Douglas a.nd posterior ligaments of the uterus (Fig. 129), thence over the body of the utenis, and from the fi'ont of the cervix to the bladder, forming the utero-vesical pouch. On each side of the uterus it is stretched across the pelvis, forming the broad ligament of the uterus, which contains the round ligament in front, the ovary and its liga- ment behind, the Fallopian tube above, and a quantity of vessels, connective tissue, and unstriped muscular fibre. The false ligaments of the bladder are the same as in the male, but are less distinctly marked; and the reflection of jjeritoneum from the bladder to the uterus in fi'ont has been named the w jifcj'io?'ligament of the uterus. [The peritoneum is to be stripped off the upper part and sides of the bladder, bat the recto-vesical pouch is not to be interfez'ed with at present. By scraping away a little fat v/ith the handle of the knife the pelvic fascia wiU be brought into view, but to examine it from the outside thoroughly the following dissection must be made. One dissector holding the pelvis fii-mly, the other is to clear away the remains of the adductor muscles on the left side of the pubes so as to expose the obturator exteruus muscle, which must then be carefully removed. Beneath the muscle will be found the branches of the obturator artery, forming a circle around the foramen and lying upon the obturator membrane, which gives passage to both obturator artery and nerve at its upper part. On removing the obturator membrane, the fibres of the obtm-ator in tern us muscle will be brought into view. With the .saw a horizontal cut is now to be made from the upper margin of the obtui-ator foramen into the cotyloid cavity, and a similar one at the lower margin of the obturator foramen, the extremities of the two cuts being about an inch apart in the bottom of the cavity. These are to be joined bv a vertical cut with the chisel, and the piece of bone bavin"- been loosened with that instrument, can bo removed with the boiie-for- ceps. With the chisel and bone-forceps the margins of the obturator foramen may then be cut away so as to leave only a rino- of bone. The obtui-ator internus being now fully exposed, should bo carefully detached from the adjacent structures, and may thenTHE PELVIS. 316 be readily removed by grasping tbe tendon with tbe bone-forceps, and drawing the whole muscle out through the lesser sacro-sciatic foramen. The outer surface of the pelvic fascia will then be exposed. ] The Pelvic Fascia (Figs. 159, 160) consists of several more or less distinct planes, which are, however, in many places continuous with one another. It is attached superiorly along the posterior part of the brim of the true pelvis, but on approaching the obturator foramen it descends to be attached to the upper border of the obtui-ator membrane, and thence extends inwards to the back of the symphysis pubis; to this it is attached in two layers, which Fig. 159. are subsequently prolonged as the parietal and visceral layers of the pelvic fascia, and are here separated from one anothei by the origin of the levator ani.

The obturator fascia (Fig. 160, 6), the outer sm-face of which has been exposed in the above dissection, is the special fascia of the obturator internus muscle, to the inner surface of which it is applied. It is attached below to the margin of the great sciatic notch behind, and to the ischial tuberosity and great sacro-sciatic ligament, and to the pubic arch, fomiing the deep layer of the tri- angular ligament. At its lower attachment is a^channel ■(«(«« Z q/ Fig. 160. Alcock) for the pudic vessels and nerves in the outer wall of the ischio-rectal fossa. 2. The recto-vesical fascia (Pig. 160, 8) is fixed in fi-ont to the back of the pubic bones above the origin of the levatores ani, and dips down between these muscles as far as the apex of the prostate, forming two rounded folds, the anterior true {piiho-prostatic) liijaments of the hJadder, beneath which lie the dorsal vein of the penis, open- mg into the prostatic plexus, and the vesico-pubic muscles derived Pig. 160.—Section of pelvis to show the pelvic fascia from the front ("drawn hv J.

It covers the upper surface of the levator ani and coccygeus, and is reflected from these upon the prostate, bladder and rectum, and upon the vagina in tho female, forming the true ligaments of the pelvic viscera. 3 The ischio-redal or anal fascia is a thin membrane covenug the outer or perinajal surface of the levator ani, and is derived from the inner aspect of the obtui-ator fascia (Fig. 160, lo). The deep layer of the triangular ligament, which has been pre- viously described, stretches across the pubic arch, and is formed by the obturator fascia. , . ■■ • <. i The ischio-redal fossa is an interspace between the ischio-rectal and the obturator'faaciee.

Thus tajDping above the symphysis may generally be effected without injury to the serous membrane, but, as the peritoneal fold occasionally fails to rise, the operation is not free from danger. The depth of the recto-vesical pouch will simi- larly be found to vary, the peritoneum reaching nearer to the prostate when the bladder is empty than when it is full; conse- quently the operation of tapping by the rectum can be only safely undertaken when the bladder is distended. The average distance of the recto-vesical pouch fi'om the anus is 2^ inches wheji both rectum and bladder are empty, and 3i inches when the bladder is distended (Cripps). The left Ureter (Fig. 161, 12), descending from the kidney, is contained in the root of the posterior false ligament of the bladder (or in the root of the broad ligament in the female), and now can be traced beneath the peritoneum to its entrance into the fundus of the bladder, at a point below and beneath the posterior extremity of the vesicula seminalis. Its relations are described on p. 292. The left Vas Deferens (Fig. 161, 8) can be traced from the testicle, and has been seen to turn down into the pelvis after leaving the inguinal canal, hooking around the deep epigastric artery, and to the inner side of the external iliac artery. It is now seen to wind over the po.sterior part of the side of the bladder, crossing the outer side of the obliterated hypogastric artery, and to be continued beneath the peritoneum to the base of the bladder, where it passes to the inner side of the ureter above the point at which the latter pierces the bladder waU, and to the mesial side of the vesicula seminalis. It will be afterwards traced to the prostate. The Prostate Gland (Fig. 161, 17) is now seen in front of the bladder as the part lies on the table; but when the body is erect it is situated below the bladder, the neck of which corresponds to the enlarged base of the gland. Its long axis is vertical or inclined lightly forwards at its lower end. The apex touches the deep triangular ligament (6) ; the posterior wall is in contact with the termination of the second portion of the rectum (or, according to some auth(jrs, with the commencement of the third part of the gut) ; the aidrrior wall lies half an inch behind the lower half of the pubic symphysis, but is separated from it by a portion of its capsule, a plexus of veins, the pubo-prostatic hgaments, and the Y sTHE PELVIS. 322 1 . fiivvn- ■ 1-Vip rides are in contact with, the vpsioo-mibic uiuscalar tibres , tne amts an. lTZoX.i.r, of the le,»to,« It is 'f^o nosterior surface (see also p. .33o).

A middle vesical branch is sometimes derived froui one of these, aud from another or from the iuferior vesical is derived the artery of the vas deferens, which accompanies the duct to the testicle and anastomoses with the spermatic artery. In the female this vessel is represented by the funicular artery to the roimd ligament. 2. The Inferior vesical and 3, Middle hcemurrhoi.dal {i6) arteries generally come oS together, and are distributed to the posterior surface of the bladder, the prostate, the vesiculaj seminales, and the adjacent portion of the rectum. The middle htemorrhoidal artery anastomoses with the superior haemorrhoidal branch of the inferior mesenteric above, and with the inferior heemorrhoidal branch of the pudic artery below. The arteries of the bladder anastomose freely with one another, and with those on the opposite side. 4. The Uterine (8) and Vayinal arteries sujjply those organs, the uterine passing in the base of the broad ligament as far as the cervix, and then running up close to the side of the body of the uterus and giving branches to its anterior and pos- terior surfaces. It anastomoses at the superior angle of the uterus with the ovarian and funicular arteries, and inferiorly with the vaginal. 0. The Obturator (g) artery passes directly forwards, below the level of the nerve and above that of the vein, to the obturator foramen, through which it disappears with the nerve, after giving oif a small pubic branch to the back of the bone, and an iliac branch to the iliacus internus and ilium. The pubic branch anastomoses with a pubic branch of the deep epigastric, and with the corresponding branch of the opposite side. The distribution of the obtm-ator artery outside the pelvis has been already seen on the right side, but may now be followed out on the left side. When the obturator arises from the epigastric artery, there is generally a small branch running in the proper i)osition with the obturator nerve. 6. The Pudic {i^) and 7, the Wcm^/c (14) arteries can onlv be seen tor a short distance within the pelvis, as they lie on the pyrifornii-^ and sacral plexus before passing through the lower part of the gi'eatcr sacro-sciatic foramen below that muscle.

It is .'in/.p/ird by a branch from the 4th sacral nerve. ^ The Coccygeus (Fig. 164, 8) is a little triangle of pale muscular fibres having its Insertinn into the side of the coccyx, and its oriijin (the apex of the tiiangle) from the spine of the ischiuaii immediately above the attachment of the levator ani, from which the muscle is separated by a narrow cellular interval. The coccygeus is intimately connected with the lesser sacro-sciatic ligament, which has nearly the same attachments and lies external to it. It is siqiplied by a branch fi-om the 4th sacral nerve. The levatores ani and coccygei raise and support the floor of the pelvis during expiration and abdominal expulsive actions. The Obturator Internus Muscle (Fig. 16o, ig) has been destroyed on the right side, but on the left side of the pelvis may be seen both above and below the level of the fascial origin of the levator ani. It urise^s fi'om the posterior aspect of tJie rami of the pubes and ischium immediately in front of the thyroid foramen • from the inner half of the pelvic surface of the obturator membrane' and from the sm-face of bone behind the foramen as far as the great sacro-sciatic notch, and above it as high as the ilio-pectineal Hue. ihe fibres end m a tendon, which timis at a right angle around the margm of the lesser sacro-sciatic foramen, to be ins.rM on the fore part of the upper border of the great trochanter of the femui-. its deep surface presents thi'ee or four Unear grooves as it winds over the edge of the sacro-sciatic notch, and the bone is here encrusted with cartilage and lubricated by a bursa.

The several nerves, as they leave the sacral foramina, receive brandies fi-om the gaugliated cord of the sympathetic on theii' inner side, and form two nerve trunks, the upper and larger one fonned hy the lumbo-sacral cord, the first, second, and part of the thii'd sacral nerves being the Great Sciatic Nerve; the lower and smaUer one receiving the remaining part of the thii-d sacral nerve, and that portion of the fourth sacral which takes part in the plexus, to form by their union the Internal Pudic Nerve. Both these nerves pass out of the pelvis through the great sacro-sciatic foramen. Branches within the Pelvis.—1. Two branches are given to the pyri/vrmis, horn the second and third sacral nerves. 2. The nerve to the nhiurntor internus (26) arises from the fifth hunbar and first and second sacral nerves, and, Ijdng on the anterior surface of the plexus, passes with the pudic nerve through the sacro-sciatic foramina to the inner sui-face of the muscle, supplj^ing in its course the gemellus superior. 3. The nerve to the qaadratus from the upper part of the plexus passes out beneath the great sciatic nerve close behind the hip-joint, and supphes the articulation and muscular twigs which enter the deep sniiaces of the quadratus and the gemellus inferior. 4.

[The bladder with the iirethi-a and the rectim having been removed as directed, should be laid on the table with the rectum uppermost, and that viscus should be filled with cotton-wool and cleaned, and its muscular fibres exposed.] « The Rectum (Fig. 161, i6). The arrangement of the peritoneum upon the rectum has been already described (p. 275), and the longitudinal muscular fibres will be now seen to differ from those of the rest of the large intestine, in being spread all around it instead of being collected in thi-ee bands ; thej^ are, however, thickened in front and behind, the anterior fibres (m. praredalis) being formed by the fusion of the omental and free ttenife of the colon. The internal or circular muscular fibres become thickened near the anus to form the internal sphincter muscle, as will be seen when the bowel is opened. The numerous arteries are derived from three sources—the superior hasmorrhoidal artery, from the mferior mesenteric, which bifurcates on reaching the'rectum, its two branches running to within three inches of the anus ; the middle hemorrhoidal from the internal iUac ; and the inferior hsemorrhoidal from the internal pudic. The veins terminate above m the portal system and below in the internal iliac veins. The intestine being opened along its unattached border, the mucous membrane wiU be seen to be smooth, except near the anus where it is thrown into longitudinal folds by the sphincter. Here also it fi-equently happens that heemorrhoids exist. Three or four transverse ridges of mucous membrane (valves or folds of Houston) will be found from three to six inches above the anus. These are effaceable by distension, except one plication, the fold of Kohhcuisch which IS permanent and involves the circular muscular fibres as well as the mucous membrane. This is of considerable sur-ical importance, as it projects as a kind of ledge from the right side of the gut, about three inches above the anus, and might be perforated by the careless introduction of a bougie or rectal tube. The mucous membrane above the anus f.or half or three quarters ot an inch has the characters of skin, and is separated from the true mucous structure by a more or less well defined line (Vvr i^o which indicates the position of the septum tliat origiually\.xisto( be wec.i the blind extremity of the f.x^tal gut and the anal dimple i the integument Immediately above the septum the re,.tal w presents a number of little pouches [lacnna- Liln.^rcs^-^^^ sharp foreign bodies may lodge (i). ^334 THK MALE ORGANS.

The latter is prolonged in front to form the y/rnw j'^'i'is (20), while behind it terminates in the dilated part called the hnlh {18), which IS covered by the bulbo-cavernosus muscle and should be cleaned. Behind the bulb is the slender membranons portion (15) of the urethra, and the jvostate (13), the posterior surface of which is now exposed with the resicnkn seminahs (10), vcsa dcferentm, and base of the bladder. On each side of the membranou.s portion of the urethi-a may be found, by careful dissection, a little yellow body of the size of a pea, Cuwjxr's yland (Fig. 168, 11), the duct of which opens into the bulbous portion of the urethi^a. By turning the preparation over, the dorsal aspect of the penis will be brought mto view, and the dorsal vessels and nerves will be seen. The dorsal vein may now be traced to its junction with the plexus of veins around the prostate and neck of the bladder. The Prostate (Pig. 167, 14) is shaped Hke a chestnut, having the small end or apex downwards and the base at the ' neck' of the bladder. Its weight in the adult is about six drachms, the same as that of the testicle; its length from base to apex is in health from lA to U iach, from before backwards it measm-es about an inch, and the greatest transverse diameter is about 1| inch but these measurements nndergo gi'eat variation in old persons,' the subjects of 'enlarged prostate.' The prostate presents two indistinct lateral lobes, the division between which is marked by a slight groove on the posterior surface, and an occasional projec- tion m the floor of the lU'ethra is described by some authors ks a third or middle lobe, but is the result of morbid changes in that portion of the body which lies above the prostatic fissure and in Iront of the ejaculatory ducts. The lu-osiutic fssur,' (12) is a little cielt m the centi-e of the posterior aspect, or base, which transmits t^e common ejaculatory ducts and sinus pocularis. The sfruct„re ol the prostate is partly glandular and partlv musciUar. A ])ower- tul sphincter of unstriped muscle is formed above the orifices of the ejaculat<jry ducts, and serves to prevent rertux of the semen into the bladder during congress ; and a quantity of muscular fibre in tront of this point, partly striped (near the apex) and partly unstriped, serves to expel the prostatic .secretion into the urethra iina au m ejacidating the mixed seminal and prostatic fluids The glandular structui-e is situated mainly in the posterior and lateral portions of the bo.ly, below the openings of the ejaculat,n-y ducts and con«i.stsof branched folbclcs, which secrete a kind of^nucu ' ZtZ T"'!""'

" The Bladder (Fig. 167j.-The p,rito,ml coat of the bladder has been already dissected and the relations of the viscus have been desci-ibed (p, 320). The muscular coat consists of three layers, external, middle, and internal. The external layer, sometimes known as the detrusor urime consists chiefly of longitudinal fibres which are best seen on the anterior and posterior surfaces of the yiscus. Those placed in frout pass m the anteiior true ligaments, and are attached to the posterior surface of the pubic bones and symphysis {vcs/co-pubic musch). The posterior fibres join the posterior part of the prostate. The middle layer consists of plexiform and cii-cular fibres, which form the sphincter vesicce around the neck of the bladder, and are closely connected with the prostatic sphincter. They decussate in their distribution over the greater part of the bladder The udernal layer is longitudinal and plexifoiin : it is continuous with the longitudinal fibres of the m-ethra, and is joined by the fibres of the ureters, which meet in the middle line and are spread over the trigonum (Ellis). ^ Beneath the musctUar coat is a quantity of loose submucous connective tissue.

In an injected preparation the tubes may be traced as follows (Fig. 171): Each lobule is composed of convoluted fuhuli snnhiiferi (3), which anatomose mth one another: these as they emerge from the lobules become sti-aight, and form the vasu rerfa (4), about twenty in number. Entering the mediastinum, the vasa recta anastomose to form the rde testis (5), from which arise the rasa efferentia (6) ; and these, from twelve to fifteen in number, pierce the tunica albuginea to form the mi,i vasciihsi (7) of the globus major of the epididymis. The ducts are then aU coUected into one tube, which by its convolutions forms the body and globus minor of the epididymis, and ends in the vas deferens. The latter enters the abdomen through the ingmnal canal, and has been traced to its opening, upon the margin of the sinus pocularis of the prostate. Attached to the top of the testis, immediately in front of the globus major of the epididymis, may generally be found one or two little vesicles caUed the hydatids of Morr/agui, the remains of Miiller's duct; and in the ceUular tissue of the cord, immediately above the epidid^-mis and beneath the fimicular tunica vaginalis, IS seen a small white branching structure, the Orga7i of Giraldes, which is probably part of the remains of the Wolffian body of the foetus.

The lower end of the uterus will be felt projecting into its cavity, but the point of reflection of the mucous membrane on to the os uteri {funux), is much higher behind than in fi-ont, and hence the greater length of the posterior wall, which lies in contact with both lips of the os. At its lower end are the remains of the htjmen (carimcuJa myrfiformes), and below these may be seen the orifices of the two smaU <j/ands of Barthohi,, above two folds of vvilvar mucous membrane called the m/mp/ut. The Uterus (Fig. 175, i) is more or less pyriform in shape, the upper part or body being broad and somewhat flattened from before backwards, and larger above than below; the lower part or cervix beuig cylindrical. It opens below into the vagina. [The anterior wall is to be divided verticaUy with scissors, and tJie cut prolonged on each side towards the Fallopian tube.] The direction of the long axis of the uterus is doubtful, but in all probability it varies considerably with the changing conditions ot the bladder and intestines. Under orcHnary cii-cumstances its summit never rises above the plane of the pelvic inlet. It IS about three inches long, and its maximum transverse and antero-posterior diameters are two inches and one inch respectively.

One of the fimbrintj {Jimbriu ovurka or tubo-uvarian liga- inent, 13) is attached to the ovary, and serves to direct the ostium in gi-asping the ovum as it emerges fi-om that organ. The tube is muscular in structui-e, and is lined by a longitudinally pHcated mucous membrane with ciliated epithelium. Its external orifice {ostium ahduinvia/e) opens into the peritoneal cavity. The Round Ligament (Fig. 175, 8) placed in the anterior part of the broad ligament is composed of unstriped muscular fibre and areolar tissue, and is covered by peritoneum. It extends from the angle of the uterus to the inguinal canal, through which it passes to become lost in the fat of the labium. In the child, and occa- sionally in the adult, it is accompanied for a short distance into the inguinal canal by a funicular process of peritoneum called the canal of Nuck. It is supplied by a small artery which anastomoses at the superior angle of the uterus with the ovarian and uterine. Its lymphatics open into the inguinal glands. The Ovary (Fig. 175, 11) is an almond-shaped body jorojecting from the posterior part of the broad ligament, and attached to the superior angle of the uterus by a muscular band, the atero-omrmn Injamtnt (12), and by its opposite extremity^ to the fimhriu ovuriru of the Fallopian tube. It rests in a shallow peritoneal sulcus [Jbssu ovariai) at the side of the true pelvis, between the internal iliac artery and vein, a little below a point midway between the anterior superior iliac spine and the median line, it presents for description a free and an attached border; two extremities, the uterine and tubal; and two surfaces. Its true position is doubtful. It is generaUy represented as lying horizontaUy with its surfaces looking upwards and downwards, and its extremities pointing inwards and outwards, but there is reason to believe that its long axis is vertical, the surfaces looking inwards and outwards (SjTningtou). It IS composed of a fibro-muscular stroma condensed peripherally into a cortex {tuniai albiujiufn), which is covered with epithelium, and contains innumerable vrisucs or Graafian, msides. From time to time certain of these ovisacs enlarge, approach the surface and burst, cUscharging each an ovum, which is received by the mouth of the oviduct and conveyed to the uterus. This process causes u scarring of the originaUy smooth tunica albuginea, and certain changes in the ruptured ovisac which lead to the fonnation of 'i yellowish mass caUed the mrpus lutmm.

The exteraal jugular vein, if fuU of blood, will probably be seen crossmg the sterno-mastoid obliquely. After the dissection of the neck is commenced, and sometimes before in thin subjects, two important bony landmarks may be distino-uished, the prominent transverse process of the atlas below the mastoid process, and the anterior tubercle of the transverse process of the 6th cervical vertebra {carotul tuherch of Chassaignac) nearly opposite the lower border of the cricoid cartilage. It will be found to be impossible to dissect both sides of the head and neck simultaneously, and the students should therefore arrange to work together, and to take turns at dissecting and reading. The dissection of both sides of the scalp should be completed on the first day, in order that the brain may be removed on the second morniag^ The ScAiiP.

The scalp so constituted is connected with the pericranium by a loose connective tissue, with large intercommunicating spaces. In the frniital and occipital regitias the epicranial aponeurosis is partially replaced by the muscular fibres of the occipito-frontalis ; and in the temporal region the aponeurosis gives attachment to the anterior and superior amicular muscles. The Muscles of the Pinna (Fig. 178) are the AUollens aurem (5) (superior), the Attraliena aurem (i) (anterior), and the Retrahens aurem (9) (posterior). The names sufficiently indicate their positions, and they are all inserted into the pinna, the anterior arisiiuj ivova. the anterior part of the aponeurosis of the occipito- fi-ontalis, and being inserted into the helix ; the superior also from the middle part of the same aponeurosis, and inserted into the fossa of the antihelix ; and the posterior, which consists of two or three stronger bundles of fibres, arising from the mastoid process and passmg to the back of the concha. 1, muscular fibres of the occipito-frontalis are to be cleaned both on the forehead and on the occiput, care being taken not to damage the mtervenmg aponeurosis, or the nerves which ijierce the muscle at several pomts and communicate in its substance.] The Occipito-frontalis (Pig. 178).—The anterim- helly (2) has no bony attachment, but blends at its origin with the fibres of the orbicularis palpebrarum, pyi-amidaHs nasi, and corrugator supercOii. Thepo«fe»'/r/,- helly arises from the outer half or two-thirds of the superior curved Hue of the occipital bone, and very slightly fi-om the mastoid process of the temporal bone, and is separated fi-om its fellow by a triangular interspace which is occupied by a prolonga- tion backwards of the epicranial aponeurosis. Both bellies are inserted into the central tendon. The muscle wrinkles the forehead transversely, elevates the eyebrows, and sHghtly aids in raising the upper Hd: in some persons it may also be made to move the entire scalp backwards and forwards by the alternating contractions of its two beUies; and m association with the auricular muscles it probably aids the circulation of Ijanph in the spaces of the connective tissue nervT^^"^ epicranial aponeurosis.

With the chisel the remaining thickness of the skull can then be readily divided without iniuring the brain, and the calvaria may be removed.] Upon Removing the Skull-cap will be seen the rough outer sm-face of the diu-a mater, and it should be noticed that it formed the mternal periosteum of the calvaria, now left bare. The inner sm-face of the Skull-cap presents a longitudinal groove nearly in the median line, con-esponding to the superior longitudinal sinus, and joming the grooves for the lateral sinus, usually a little to the nght of the middle line and opposite the external occipital protuber- ance. On each side of the longitudinal groove may frequently be seen depressions of variable size, con-esponding to the Pacchionian bodies. The grooves for the middle meningeal vessels will be seen chiefly on the inner siu'face of the parietal and temporal bones The Dura mater is cream-coloured, but often has a bluish appear- ance when Its translucency aUows the veins of the surface of the brain to be partially seen. On each side of the middle line are usuaUy found the Pacchionian bodies, hj-pertrophied viUi of the arachnoid, projecting thi-ough the diu'a mater and indenting the skull. Eamifying upon the dura mater is the large middle menin- . <jeal artery [mternal maxiUary], and in a weU-injected body the antermr menimjeal [ethmoidal] and posterior menimjeal /ascendin- pharpigeal) may sometimes be seen. The meningeal arteries are the pi-mcipal nutrient vessels of the bones as weU as of the membranes. The Middle Meningeal Veins (venae comites) accompany the artery and terminate m the internal maxillary, and the other meningeal veins end m the sinuses of the dura mater. The Sinuses are the intracranial canals in, which tei-minate the vems of the brain, orbit, and diploe. They differ fi-om the ordinary veins, (1) in the rigid natm-e of their walls, which consist of a layer ot the dura mater lined with venous endothelium, and remain ^ entwhen divided; (2) in having no valves; and (3) in that their tributaries join them in a direction contrary to that of the current ot blood withm them.

It receives superior cerebral, diploic, memngeal, and pericranial veins (through the paiietal foramina); the orifices of its tributaries all pointing from behmd forwards, i.e., in the opposite direction to the current of blood m the sinus itself. [The dura mater is to be divided longitudinally on each side of the sinus and turned down. By this means the subdural space mil be opened, and the arachnoid membrane will be seen reflected over the pia mater covering the brain. By slightly separating the two hemispheres of the brain with the handle of the knife, the iaU cerebri wiU be exposed, and must be detached from the crista galii of the ethmoid bone.] Removal of the Brain.—The head being tilted a Kttle back- wards, the anterior lobes of the cerebrum are to be raised, when the Olfactory nerves and bulbs (1st pair) wiU probably be detached with them from the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone, or if not, they can be readily displaced with the handle of the knife. The Optic Nerves (2nd pah") of large size, will be seen close to the aatenor cHnoid processes, and should be divided, when the Internal Carotid Ai-teries will be brought into view, and must also be cut, together with the infundihuhtm attached to the idtuitary hochj in the middle line. The 3rd pair {mutores uculorum) will be seen piercmg the dura mater behind and a little external to the carotid arteries and behind th^ anterior clinoid process, and after dividing these, the tentorium cerebelli wiU be brought into view, with the slender 4th nerve {patheticus vel trochlmris) on each side, at the pomt ot tHe decussation between its free and attached borders, a little behind and external to the posterior clinoid process. The tentorium is to be divided on each side by carrying the knife backwards and out- wards, parallel to the margin of the petrous bone, and the 4th pair will be cut at the same time. The tentoiium having been turned aside, the remaining cranial nerves will be exposed, and must be cut, in their numerical order. The 5th pair {trifarial) will be ound to be composed each of two roots, the larger and suporior one bemg chiefly sensory, and the deeper, which is anterior at its ongm, chiefly motor in function. The 6th pair {abdaceutcs) lie nearer the median line below the posterior clinoid processes.

The 9th nerve or glosao-pharyn- ijtal vuns with the 10th or iwjns, and the 11th or spinal accessory, to jjierce the diu'a mater at a point external to the jugular eminence of the occipital bone, and appear in the angle between the lateral and inferior petrosal sinuses, where these are about to pierce the jugular foramen before uniting to form the jugular vein. The 9th is the highest of the three, and has a separate dural aperture, while the 11th is joined by spinal filaments which pass upwards from the spmal canal. The three nerves disappear thi-oiigh the forwmcu lace- rum posterms or jugular foramen with the sinuses named. The 12th (hypoylossal) nerve consists of two bundles placed near the median Ime, which pierce the dura mater separately between the jugular eminence and foramen magnum and then pass together through the anterior condyloid foramen. At the point of junction between the falx cerebri and the tentorium will be found the atraiyht sinus, joining the lateral and superior longitudinal sinuses at the torcular Herophih: it receives anteriorly the inferior longitudinal sinus which runs m the free border of the faLx cerebri, and the veins of Cralen passmg from the velum interpositum; and in its com-se it is jomed by the superior cerebellar veins.

By displacing the Gasserian ganglion will be seen a Uttle groove m the upper smiace of the petrous bone, conducting a small nerve and artery to the hiatus Pallopii, thi-ough which they disappear. They are the cjrmier suptrficia/pdrosal nerve and artery; the nerve the continuation of the Vidian, going to join the facial, and the artery a branch of the middle meningeal. Two other nerves may be found entering the temporal bone, on the outer side of the hiatus i^allopu; one, the small superficial petrosal, is the communication between the Tympanic plexus of the Glosso-Phaiyngeal Nerve and the otic gangHon; the other, the eHernal superficial petrosal, also passing to the facial nerve, is derived from the sympathetic on the nuddJe meningeal artery.

The Middle Meningeal Artery can be seen entering at the foramen spmosum It ramifies on the outside of the dura mater, and divides mto two branches, an anterior, which grooves deeply the tip of the great wing of the sphenoid and the anterior inferior angle of the parietal bone, and a posterior crossing the squamous portion of the temporal bone to reach the parietal bone near the middle of its lower border. It supplies nearly the whole of the dmu mater and cranial bones, and gives smaU twigs to the facial and fifth nerves to the orbit and to the temporal fossa. It is accompanied by vem.

The ti-iangle is subdivided into two lesser triangles by the posterior belly of the omo-hyoid muscle, at a variable distance above the clavicle. The upper or occipital trianyh' contains the superficial branches of the cervical plexus derived from the first four cervical nerves; the spinal-accessory nerve (which may be traced from the level of the transverse process of the atlas along the outer surface of the levator anguli scapulte into the trapezius, where it communicates with branches of the 3rd and 4th cervical nerves); muscular branches of the cervical plexus to the levator anguli scapula, scalenus medius and trapezius ; communicating branches with the spinal accessory the occipital artery, the transverse cervical vessels, the posterior external jugular vein, the upper part of the brachial plexus, and some of the lymphatic glands placed along the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid.

The size of this space varies with the level at which the omo-hyoid crosses the neck, with the extent of clavicular attachment of the sterno-mastoid, and, more miportantly, with the degree of elevation of the clavicle.

The origin and insertion of the muscle are found in other dissections. The Transverse Cervical Artery (Fig. 185, as) is generally found at the level of the tendon of the omo-hyoid, and the Vein a little above it, so that their relations to the subdivisions of the triangle are somewhat different. The artery, a branch of the thyroid axis [subclavian], passes transversely under the sterno-mastoid and over the scalene muscles, crosses the posterior triangle, and divides under the border of the trapezius into the superficial cervical and posterior scapular arteries. The superficial cervical goes to the trapezius, the anterior border of which it supplies, and terminates by anastomosing with superficial branches of the princeps cervicis of the occipital; the posterior scapular runs beneath the levator anguli scapulse muscle to the vertebral border of the scapula, where it is seen in the dissec- tion of the back. The posterior scapiilar artery, however, often arises as a separate trunk from the second or thii-d part of the subclavian artery, the superficial cervical then alone occupjdng the position of the transverse cervical. The transverse cervical vein lies above the level of the artery, and joins the external jugular. The Supra-scapular Artery and Vein (Fig. 185, 31) lie close behind the clavicle. The artery is nearly always a branch of the thyroid axis, but occasionally arises from the second or thu-d part of the subclavian. It runs in front of the thii-d stage of the subclavian artery, and passes behind the clavicle to reach the upper border of the scapula. The vein opens into the external jugular, just before it joins the subclavian vein. The Third portion of the Subclavian Artery (Fig. 185, 30) extends from the outer border of the anterior scalenus, obliquely downwards and outwards behind the clavicle, to the outer boi-der of the fii'st rib, where it becomes the axillary artery. It has w front the skm, platysma, superficial nerves, deep fascia, clavicle, subclavius muscle, and supra-scapular vessels; and is crossed by the smaU nerve to the subclavius, and by the external jiigular vem, which is joined at this point by the supra-scapular and transverse cervica veins. Behind are the scalenus medius, the pleura, and the lowest trunk of the brachial plexus. Above run the other trunks of tiie brachial plexus: and below, at some distance and in an anterior plane, is the subclavian vein. The subclavian groove on the first rib lies behind and below the artery owing to the downward slope ot the rib, and a bui-sa will often be found between the bone and the vessel.

The nerves appear at the outer border of the anterior scalenus in four pieces, because the Sth cervical and 1st thoracic unite close to the vertebral foramina; the oth and 6th next unite, and thus three trunks are formed. The three trunks formed by the jimction of the five nerves sub- divide and reunite to form three cords, as follows. Each tnink divides into an anterior and a posterior branch; the anterior branches of the upper and middle trunks foim the outer cord, the anterior branch of the lowest forms the inner cord, and the three posterior branches unite to form the posterior cord. Several varieties have been described in the arrangement of the cords ; but this win be found to be the most common. The hranches above the clavicle (Fig. 187)— a. The nerve to the subclavius is a small branch lying in front of the plexus, and derived from the trunk formed by the 5th and 6th nerves above the supra-scapular nerve. It crosses the 3rd stage of the subclavian artery to reach the muscle, and communicates with the phrenic nerve. h. The nerve to the rhomboids is from the Sth nerve. It pierces the"scalenus medius, passes beneath the levator anguli scapulas, to which it gives a branch, and ends by entering the under surface of the rhomboids. c. The Suprascapular nerve, the largest branch above the clavicle, appears above and at the outer side of the plexus, and is given off from the cord formed by the oth and 6th. It dis- appears behind the trapezius, clavicle, and posterior beUy of the omo-hyoid, to reach the supra-scapular notch. d The nerve to the serratus maynus (i^osterior thoracic, external respiratory of BeU) lies behind the plexus against the seiTatus ma-nus muscle, and is derived from the oth and 6th and 7th nerves before they join, the formative branches uniting m the scalenus- medius. .... . . , e.

The nerve to the inferior oblique is the only long muscular nerve in the orbit. [To expose the obliquus inferior, it will be necessary to di-aw the eyeball to the upper and outer angle of the orbit, and to remove the conjunctiva at the lower and inner part.] The ObUquus Inferior (Fig. 193, g) muscle Hes obliquely in the orbit beneath the rectus inferior. It arises from the floor of the orbit just outside the lachrymal groove, and passing below the inferior rectus, then between the external rectus and sclerotic, is inserted into the globe a little behind the equator, above the level of the rectus extermis, and close to the insertion of the obhquus superior Like the other muscles, it receives an investment ti;om the capsule of Tenon. It rotates the upper end of the vertical mea-idian of the globe outwards (antagonising the superior obhque), and aids in abduction and elevation of the cornea. Summary of the Actions of the Ocular Muscles.-The cornea is raised by the superior rectus and inferior oblique depressed by the inferior rectus and superior oblique, abducted by the externa rectus, and adducted by the internal rectus. The upper end of the vekical meridian of the eye is rotated outwards by the inferior oblique and inferior rectus, and inwards by the supenor obhque and superior rectus. The oblique upward and ^o-nward mo^- ments of the cornea are effected by the same muscles a. the duect movements, aided by the external and internal recti: thus, the TeTs cHrected upwards and outwards by the combined action o he superior and External recti and the ^^f^^'^^ and inwards by the superior and internal recti and the inferior """Se Capsule of Tenon maybe demonstrated upon Ae subject without any serious difficulty, and should be ^^''^f^^^'^-f The capsule proper invests and is co-extensive with the scleioti .

That to the superior oblique covers only the reflected tendon, and terminates at the pulley; the others fonn each a loose sheath for the tendon, but blend intimately with the perimysium of the muscular belly and become less and less demonsti'able as they approach the origin. With each of the vaginal processes, except that to the superior obUque, is connected a process of fixatkw, which is directly or Fig. 194. 15- mdn-ectly attached to the bony waU of the orbit in such a manner as to hmit the contraction of the muscle and alter somewhat its line oi action. These secondary processes are of considerable strength and contam unstriped muscular fibre. The external rectus process IS attached to the outer margin of the orbit, the internal rectus process goes to the lachrymal crest, while those of the superior and la^enor recti pass to the orbital border of the tarsal cartilages, and only mdn-ectly to the orbital margin through the tarsal ligaments Fig. 194.—Frontal !• Supra-trochlear nerve. 2.

If all the contents of the orbit are removed, the lO-Mal bnnoM ,,/ the superior maxillary nerve [teiiiporo-malar) may be seen passing through the spheno-maxiUary fissure, and dividing into two branches—the sahcutaiieus iimIch, which pierces the malar bone, and the temporal branch, which pierces the outer waU of the orbit to reach the temporal integument (p. 361); and the spheno- maxillary fissui-e will be found closed by involuntary muscular fibre, the orhitalis. The Side of the Neck. [The head is to be drawn as far back as possible by means of a hook placed in the chin, and the side to be dissected (by preierence the right side first) should be made prominent by means of blocks placed beneath. Before beginning the d-^^'^tr,; ^^^^ should pass his finger along the median line of the neck, and reco^nis^e the followmg poiSts. Firstly, the lower jaw, and fi-om an inch and a half to two inches below it the slight P^lfctiou o^ the hvoid bone ; next a hollow, corresponding to the thyro-hyoid membrane, and below this the projecting angle of the thyroi^ Silage (pomum Adami), which is very sma 1 m women; about an nch beFow the pomum Adami is a depression corresponding t« Se So-thyroid space, through which laryngotomy if. performed stm lower will be felt the hard ring of the cricoid cartilage and m a thin subject the rings of the trachea may be recognised lowei down; sometimes also the isthmus of the thyroid body may be felt cTO^si^ff the trachea, usually over the second and third rings. An indsfon is to be made from the chm to the sternum, and another outwards along the clavicle as. far as incision P^.^ with hooks.] The Platysma Myoides (Fig. 185, 6) is now seen to reach to the side of the lower jaw, where it is partially --;^<^.^- its fibres-blend with the muscles of the lower hp. The niuscle decussates in the median line with its feUow of the op^iosite side fo a short distance above, but at the lower part o the rinno-ular interval exists between the two. A few small bianche^ the superficial cervical nerve will be found l-rcmg the mus le and the external and anterior jugular vein., may sometimes be seen through its fibres.397 THE STERNO-CLEIDO-MASTOID MUSCLE. [The platysma is to be carefully reflected upwards like the skin, the superficial nerves are to be dissected out, and the sterno-mastoid cleaned by removing that part of the deep cervical fascia which forms the superficial layer of its sheath.] The External Jugular Vein (Fig. 195, 14) is formed by the junction of the internal maxillary and temporal veins in the parotid gland. The trunk so formed {temporo-maxillaTy) is soon joined by the'posterior auricular (10) and sometimes by the occipital vein, and gives off a large commxmicating vessel, the nmimunicating facial (13), to the common trunk of the lingual and facial veins (internal jugular); it then crosses the sterno-mastoid between this muscle and the platysma, and receives, near the middle of the neck, the posterior exteriuil jugular (12) from the cervical and occipital region. Reaching the outer border of the sterno-mastoid, close to its clavicular origin, it is joined by three tributaries, the transversalis colli (16) and supra-scapular (18) on the outer side, and the anterior jugular (23) in fi'ont. Finally it pierces the deep fascia and opens into the subclavian vein. The vein and its principal tributaries are valved before their terminations. The Anterior Jugular Vein (Fig. 195, 23) begins beneath the chin by the union of small superficial and deep branches, and passes down the neck, near the middle line, to reach the sterno-mastoid. It here receives a tributary (19), sometimes of considerable size, communicating with the facial above, and running along the anterior border of the sterno-mastoid. It then pierces tEe deep fascia, runs beneath the sterno-mastoid a little above its origin, and ends, as stated, in the external jugular. The two anterior jugular veins are joined together, just above the sternum, by a transverse branch, which runs in the fat between the two layers of the deep cervical fascia. The vessel may be wounded in the operation for wry-neck. The Superficial Cervical Nerve (Fig. 185, 17), a nerve of small size, is seen to divide into two or three branches supplying the skin over the anterior triangle, the upper one communicating with branches of the facial nerve below the jaw. The Sterno-CIeido-Mastoid Muscle (Fig. 185, 28) arises by a rounded tendon from the anterior surface of the manubrium stemi, about half an inch below the supra-sternal notch, and by a broad tendinous bilammar origin from the inner third of the upper part of the clavicle. Between the two heads of origin is a cellular interval, which may extend for some distance up the neck.

The superficial lamina of the clavicular head (cleido-mastoid) forms a muscular belly, which passes to the mastoid process beneath the insertion of the sternal head ; and the deep lamina {dtido-occipitnUs) runs to the superior curved line of the occipital bone underneath the hinder portion of the sternal head. Along the posterior bonier of and beneath the muscle wiU be seen several small lymphatic glands. Its nerve supply is derived from the spinal accessory and fi-om the anterior division of the 2nd cervical nerve. The action of the sterno-cleido-mastoid is (1) to flex the neck at all the cervical articulations below the second; (2) to lateralise the head towards the shoulder of the same side, moving all the cervical joints except the second; and (3) to rotate the face towards the opposite shoulder, partly thi-ough the atlanto-axial joint, and partly at the other cervical articulations. Thus, during complete contrac- tion, the face would be made to look upwards and to the opposite side while the neck is inclined forwards. If both muscles act together from below they would dii-ectly flex the neck at the cervical articulations below the second, but they would tend to extend the head at the occipito-atlantal joint. If the head and neck be fixed the muscle raises the sternum and so aids in inspiration. The superficial layer of the Deep Cervical Fascia, which has been described as extending from the trapezius across the posterior triangle, and then as forming a sheath for the sterno-mastoid Qj. 379), IS now seen to cover in the parts included in the anterior triangle, and to extend to the median line closing in the carotid and submaxillary triangles (p. 401). Above, it adheres to the body of the hyoid bone and, after ensheathing the submaxillary gland is attached to the lower border of the inferior maxilla ; from the au-le of the jaw a strong slip extends to the styloid process of the tem- poral bone (stylo-maxillary ligament), separating the parotid from the submaxillary gland, and between the jaw and the mastoid pro- cess It extends over the parotid gland to the zygomatic arch, forming the parotid fascia.

A Second, deeper layer of fascia covers the sterno- hyoid, thyro-hyoid and omo-hyoid, binding down the central tendon of the latter muscle to the clavicle, and sending a process called the mediastinum colli backwards between the cervical viscera (oesopha- gus, larynx and trachea, &c.) and the common carotid artery, to join the prevertebral aponeurosis opposite the cervical ti-ansverse processes. A TJiird and still deeper layer ensheaths the thyroid body, fixes its isthmus to the hyoid bone, and its lateral lobes to the extremities of the first and second tracheal rings {superior and lateral thyroid h'yaments); and passing downwards becomes con- nected with the front of the pericardium. The carotid sheath is fonned -by the junction of the various layers of cervical fascia surrounding the vessels. Well-marked lymph spaces may be demonstrated between the fascial layers in the neck in certain situations. The chief of these are (1) the pre-viscercd fissure, in front of the trachea and thyroid body, extending downwards behind the lower extremities of the sterno-hyoid and sterno-thyroid muscles into the superior medi- astinum ; (2) the retro-viscercd fissure, between the pharynx and oesophagus in front and the vertebral column and pre-vertebral muscles behind This is boimded on each side by the mediastinum, colli, and may be traced upwards as far as the base of the cranium and downwards into the superior and posterior mediastina ; (3) the sterno-mastoid fissure, behind the lower part of the sterno-mastoid muscle. It extends downwards into the axiUa and into the superior mediastinum. These fissures have considerable influence upon the direction followed by pus in cases of disease of the cervical vertebi-se, or deep suppurations in the neck. The Anterior Triangle (Pig. 185) of the neck is a space botmded in front by the median line from the symphysis menti to the sternum ; behind by the sterno-mastoid muscle ; its base is formed by the lower jaw and a line from the angle of the jaw to the mastoid process; and its apex is below, at the,top of the sternum. It is covered in by the skin and superficial fascia, the platysma, the superficial layer of the deep fascia, and the superficial vessels and nerves; and is subdivided into three smaller triangles by the anterior belly of the omo-hyoid, the stylo-hyoid and posterior belly of the digastricus, and the body of the hyoid bone. The Submaxillary Triangle is bounded above by the lower border of the inferior maxilla and the stylo-niaxillary ligament; in front by the midline from chin to hyoid bono, and behnv by theFig. 196.

The commencement of the external and internal carotids is seen at, or near, the upper border of the thyroid cartilage, and both vessels are crossed superficially by the hj^joglossal nerve, a small twig of which to the thyro-hyoid muscle should be preserved ; the superior laryngeal nerve appears on the inner side of the carotid vessels, passing behmd the internal and external carotid arteries to enter the larjmx thi-ough the interval between the hyoid bone and the thjToid cartilage, between the middle and inferior constrictors of the pharynx. Lower down, a branch of this nerve, the external laryngeal, ending in the crico-thyroid, should be sought for. The superior thja-oid, lingual, and facial arteries are partly visible in the anterior portion of the space; and the occipital artery is seen tm-jiing backwards below the digasti-ic, with the hji^oglossal nerve curving roimd its sterno-mastoid branch. The Inferior Carotid Triangle is bounded in front by the median line from hyoid bone to sternum, heliind and above by the omo-hyoid, hehind and below by the sterno-mastoid. Its floor is fomied by the sterno-hyoid and sterno-thyroid muscles, the thyroid body, the larynx, trachea, and oesophagus, the thyi-oid vessels, some small nerves, and lymphatics. [It will be advisable to examine the ligaments of the inner end oi the clavicle, before detaching it. The sternal origin of the sterno-mastoid must be cut, and any remains of the pectoraUs inaior must be removed, in order that the Hgaments between the clavicle, sternum, and first rib, and also between the two clavicle'; may be cleaned.

The sterno-mastoid (with the portion of the clavicle) is then to be turned back, being carefully separated from the fascia beneath. The spinal-accessory nerve wdl be found to pierce it at the upper part, and a branch of the 2nd cervical nerve enters the under-surface of the muscle.] Parts beneath the Sterno-Mastoid Muscle.—By the removal of the sterno-mastoid the following structures will be brought into view, which must be subsequently studied in detail. Above are seen the posterior beUy of the digastric and the stylo-hyoid; with the posterior auricular artery and parotid gland at the upper border of the digastric, and the occipital artery at the lower border of the same muscle. Lower down and posteriorly are parts of the splenius capitis, levator anguU scapulte, and scalenus medius, with the cervical nerves and Ijnnphatic glands. In front, immediately below the digastric, the spinal-accessory nerve and a branch of the anterior division of the 2nd cervical nerve will be found piercmg the deep fibres of the sterno-mastoid, and the hypoglossal nerve arching forward over the carotid vessels. The common carotid, with the mternal jugular vein external to it, and the pnemno- gastric nerve lying deeply between the two, appears m a sheath of fascia above the border of the omo-hyoid ; and the descendens cervicis nerve lies either upon or in the sheath, and forms one or more loops with the communicating branches from the cei-vica nlexus The bifurcation of the carotid wiU be seen about the level of the upper border of the thyi-oid cartilage, the mtemal carotid pasSg upwards by the side of the jugular vem, with the external carotid in front of it; the anterior branches of the latter reaching 0 W beyond the sterno-mastoid, and the superior and middle Woid veins opening into the internal .ng^Aav Near the clavi le subclavian veins.

[The fascia is now to be removed from the snpe:-ficial muscles of the triangle, but the carotid sheath should be left untouched for the present.] The Sterno-hyoid (Fig. 198, 14) is the most superficial muscle ; it is separated from its feUow of the opposite side by only a small ceUular interval above, but diverges from it below. It arises from the back of the first piece of the sternum, the posterior sterno- clavicular ligament, and the inner extremity of the clavicle; and is ■inserted into the body of the hyoid bone. It is a depressor of the hyoid bone, fixing it during the action of the supra-hyoid muscles. It may act feebly as a muscle of inspiration, by raising the sternum when the hyoid bone is fixed from above. t The Sterno-tliyroid (Fig. 198, 15) is deeper and broader than the preceding muscle, by which it is partly covered. It arises fi-om the back of the sternum below the sterno-hyoid, and fi-om the first or sometimes the second costal cartilage ; and is inserted into the oblique line on the .side of the thyroid cartilage^ It very generally has a transverse tendinous intersection m its fibres, it is separated from its fellow above by a considerable interval, but comes into close contiguity with it below. It is a depressor of the thyroid cartilage, and a feeble elevator of the sternum when the cartilage is drawn upwards and fixed. The Thyro-hyoid (Fig. 198, 16) is a dii-ect continuation of the last muscle. It arises from the obHque hne of the thyi'oid cartilage, and passing beneath the omo-hyoid is ivserted into the lower border of the bodv and greater cornu of the hyoid bone. It is an elevator of the thyroid cartilage acting from above, and a depressor of the hyoid bone acting from below, when the thyroid cartilage is drawn downwards and fixed. The Omo-liyoid (Fig. 198, 17) can now be seen m its who e length, crossing the neck beneath the sterno-mastoid, and consist- ing of two bellies united by a small tendon, which has been seen to be held down to the clavicle and first rib by a process of the deep cervical fascia. It arises from the upper margin of the scapula close to the notch, and from the transverse ligament which conveit^ the supra-scapular notch into a foramen : and ,s vrserted uito the body of the hyoid bone externally to the sterno-hyoid. and superficially to the thyro-hyoid muscle.THE STVLO-HYOID. 407 It is a depressor of the hyoid bone and a feeble elevator of the scapula. The steruo-hyoid, sterno-thyi'oid, and omo-hyoid muscles are aU supplied by the ansa hj^joglossi, except the anterior belly of the omo-hyoid, which receives a branch from the descendens cervicis. The thyro-hyoid is supplied by a special branch of the hypoglossal nerve. The Digastric (Pig. 198, i) muscle consists of two bellies, placed above the hyoid bone, to which the intermediate tendon is attached by fascia. It arises from the digastric fossa on the inner side of the mastoid process of the temporal bone; and is inserted into a rough surface at the lower border of the inferior maxilla, close to the median line. Its action is to depress the lower jaw, or if the jaw is fixed, to raise the hyoid bone and larynx. Its posterior belly is supplied by a branch of the facial nerve, and the anterior by the mylo-hyoid branch of the inferior dental nerve (oth). The submaxillary salivary gland lies in the angle between the two beUies. The Stylo-hyoid (Eig. 198, 4) is the muscle in immediate con- nection with the posterior beUy of the digastric, and is pierced by the tendon of the latter close to the hyoid bone. It arises from the outer or posterior part of the base of the styloid process of the temporal bone, and is inserted into the upper surface of the body of the hyoid bone at its jruiction with the great cornu. It is an elevator of the hyoid bone and is supplied by the facial nerve. [In order to show the sheath of the carotid vessels completely, the sterno-hyoid and sterno-thyroid must be reflected. But before doing so the dissector of the left side should seek the termination of the thoracic duct {v. p. 422). Tv'^^^^ muscles have been reflected the sheath is to be opened ihe descendens cervicis nerve has already been traced upon it and within will now be found the common 'carotid arterv nearest the median line ; more externally the internal jugular vein," and between but behind these the pueumo-gastric (or vagus) nerve.

Oil the right side it commences behind the top of the steruo-clavi- ciilar articulation, by the Ijifurcation of the innominate into common carotid and subclavian arteries, but ou the left side it begins at the arch of the aort.a. Its direction in the neck is upwards and a little outwards, and would be sufficientlj^ indicated bj' a line from the inner end of the clavicle to the fi-ont of the mastoid 2)rocess. It ordinarily divides at the level of the upper border of the thyi'oid cartDage into external and interaal carotids. Its relations are—in front superficial structui-es including the platysma, the sternal origin and anterior border "of the storno- mastoid, the lower portion of the sterno-hyoid and sterno-thAToid muscles, the sterno-mastoid branch of the superior thyroid artery, the internal jugular vein at the root of the neck on the left side, the middle and superior thyi-oid veins, the anterior jugular vein (separated fi-om the artery by the sterno-hyoid and sterno-thyroid muscles), the descendens and communicans cervicis nerves, and a portion of the lateral lobe of the thji-oid body. Behind are the thi-ee lower cervical and two upper thoracic vertebrce, with the longus colli and rectus capitis anticus major, the subclavian artery, the vertebral and inferior thyroid arteries, the recm-rent laryngeal nerve, the spnpathetic cord and middle cervical ganglion, the thoracic duct on the left side and the right Ijonphatic trunk on the nght. Externally are the internal jugular vein, which overlaps it below on the left side, the pneumo-gasti-ic nerve, and the apex of the lung (especially on the left side); and mternalh/ the trachea, larjaax, thyroid body, pharynx, oesophagus, and recm-rent laryngeal nerve'. The point of bifurcation of the common carotid may vary a little, but is more frequently above than below the upper'border of the thyroid cartilage. The vessel is somewhat enlarged at its termina- tion, and here is closely related in front to a vascular glomeruJus (which resembles a mass of connective tissue in the dead subject) called the carotid f/anglion. The Internal Carotid Artery (Fig. 200, 8) ascends to the base of the skull, lying close to the pharynx, and upon the prevertebral muscles, the vagus, and the sj-mpathetic cord. It is first to the outer side of the external carotid, and is crossed in front bv the hyiDoglossal nerve, the digastric and stylo-hyoid muscles, and the posterior auricular and occipital arteries; and 6eAr»tZ by the superior laryngeal branch of the pneumo-gastric. In its further course it i'. deeper than the external carotid, and is separated from it by the styloid process, the stylo-glossus and stylo-pharyngeus niusoles, the ^losso-pharjTigeal nerve, and the pharyngeal braneli of the vaeus J- maily it enters the carotid canal in the petrous bone 'THE SID IS OF THE NECK. 410 The artery will be more fiilly traced out in tlie deep dissection of the neck and phar^^lx.

Superficially in the neck it is crossed by the digastric and stylo-hyoid muscles, the hypo- glossal nerve, and the lingual and facial veins, and deeply is separated from the internal carotid by the styloid process, the stylo-glossus and stylo-pharyngeus muscles, the pharyngeal branch of the vagus, and the glosso-pharyngeal nerve. It enters the parotid gland behind the angle of the jaw, and in the gland lies beneath the tejnporo-maxiUary vein and is crossed superficially by the facial nerve. Tnferimlli/ are the hyoid bone, the pharynx, the ramus of the lower jaw, and the stylo-maxillary Hgament. Its branches may be divided as follows :— Anterior set: 1, Superior Thyroid; 2, Lingual; 3, Facial. Posterior set: 1, Occipital; 2, Posterior Am-icular. Ascending branch : Ascending Pharyngeal. • Terminal branches : 1, Temporal; 2, Internal Maxillary. The anterior and posterior sets can now be partly dissected ; the rest will be given in other dissections. The Superior Thyroid Artery (Fig. 199, 12) arises close to the bifurcation of the common carotid, and sometimes fi'om the main artery itself. It mns forward beneath the depressor muscles of the hyoid bone, and then downward to the thyi-oid body to anastomose with the inferior thyi-oid artery from the subclavian and with the thj-i-oid vessels of the opposite side. It gives off an inferior hi/oid hrnnrh, which runs along the lower border of the hyoid bone, and anastomoses with its fellow of the opposite side and with the hyoid Fig. 201.—The triangles of the neck (from Maclise's Surgical Anatomy).

The Lingual Artery (Fig. 199, 8).—Only a very small portion of the lingual artery is now visible, running first upwards and then transversely upon the middle constrictor of the pharynx, imme- diately above the greater cornu of the hyoid bone, to disappear beneath the edge or through the fibres of the hyo-glossus muscle. It is crossed by the digasti-ic and stylo-hyoid mussles and the hyiioglossal nerve, and overlapped by the submaxillary gland. The remainder of the vessel will be described in the dissection of the submaxillary region. The Facial Artery (Fig. 199, 4) passes upwards and forwards beneath the digastric and stylo-hyoid muscles and hypoglossal nerve, and forms a remarkable sigmoid curve as it lies in a deep groove on* the posterior part of the submaxillary gland before reaching the jaw. It crosses the jaw with the facial vein to its outer side, immediately in fi'ont of the masseter muscle, and will be followed out in the dissection of the face. Its inferior puhitine branch may be seen disappearing between the stylo-glossus and stylo-pharyngeus muscles, and the tcmsillar branch between the stylo-glossus and pterygoideus internus; its submaxillary branches (two or three) enter the gland, and the sul-mental branch, often of large size, runs forward over the mylo-hyoid muscle to the chin, where it supplies the surrounding tissues and anastomoses with the subUngual, inferior labial and superior hyoid arteries. The facial artery frequently arises in common with the hngual. The Occipital Artery (Fig. 199, i) is only seen in its first part It runs backwards along the inferior border of the digastric, and then beneath its origin in a special groove in the mastoid portion of the temporal bone, and may usually be recognised by the fact that the hypoglossal nerve hooks round its sterno-mastoid branch. The artery crosses the hypoglossal nerve, internal carotid artery, pneumo-gastric nerve, internal jugular vein, spinal-accessory nerve, and sympathetic trunk. It gives off a stcrno- mustoul branch, which enters that muscle with the spinal-accessory nerve, its further cour.se will be traced later. _ The Posterior Auricular Artery, of much smaller size than the last and not easily seen unless carefully looked for, arises above the digastric and in the substance of the parotid gland. Xear theTHE INTERNAL JUGULAR VEIN. 413 mastoid process it gives off the stylo-mastoid hru)u-h into tlie stylo- mastoid foramen, and then supplies aaricuJur, mastoid, and temjioral branches to the pinna and the structures of the mastoid and posterior temporal region, besides sending a small branch beneath the posterior belly of the occipito-f rontalis. It anastomoses with the temporal and occij)ital arteries. The Veins con-esponding to the bi'anches of the external carotid artery do not take quite the same course as those vessels. The internal maxillary and temporal veius unite iu the parotid to form the trinporu-maxillary vein, which afterwards receives the postcrifir (luricnlar vein, and passes down in the substance of the gland on the outer side of the external carotid artery and facial nerve ; at the angle of the jaw it divides into the external jugular and the facial communicatiny. The latter joins the facial vein to form the common facial, which enters the Internal Jugular. The facial vein, is more supei-ficial than the artery and runs over the submaxillary gland. The lingual vein usually joins the facial. The occipital vein seldom accompanies the artery, but generally ends in a network beneath the complexus. The Internal Jugular Vein (Fig. 199, 5) is deeply placed to the outer side of the internal carotid artery immediately below the base of the skidl, and afterwards holds the same relation to the common carotid artery. It is crossed by the stjdoid process and stylo- pharyngeus muscle, the spinal-accessory nerve (which, however, is sometimes beneath the vein), the digastric and stylo-hyoid muscles and the occijjital artery. It is covered by the steruo-uiastoid in the lower part of its course. It has the pneumo-gasti'ic nerve between it and the internal and common carotid arteries, and is enclosed in the carotid sheath of cervical fascia. It receives the facial, lingual, p/iarynyeal, superior thyroid, and iniddlc thyroid veins, and unites with the subclavian vein to form the rena innominata. Its relation to the carotid artery differs on the two sides. At the root of the neck, on the left side, it somewhat overlaps the artery, but on the right is separated from it by a small angular interval. [Tlie inner end of the clavicle having been removed with the sterno-mastoid, a little dissection close above the sternum will readily expose the scalenus anticus muscle attached to the first rib, haying the phrenic nerve lying upon it, and branches of the thvroid axis crossing it. The puciuno-gastric if traced down will bo found to cross the first part of the subclavian artery, which with its branches is to be defined. The sympathetic, and the thoracic duct on the left side, are to bo carefully preserved.]THE smE OF THE NECK. 414 The Subclavian Arteries differ on the two sides, the right beginning at the bifurcation of the innominate opposite the sterno- clavicular articulation ; and the left in the thorax at the arch of the aorta. Both arteries may be divided into three parts, of which the second and third correspond on the two sides of the body, while the cervical portion of the first jjart of the left differs but little in its relations from the first part on the right side. The first imH on the right side extends from the bifui'cation of the innominate artery, behind the ujjper border of the sterno-clavicular articulation, to the inner margin of the scalenus anticus. Its coui'se is obliquely upwards and outwards. It is related in front to the skin, superficial fascia, platysma, deep fascia, the sterno- mastoid, sterno-hyoid, and sterno-thyroid muscles ; the commence- ment of the common carotid artery, the internal jugular, anterior jugular, and vertebral veins ; the pneumo-gastric, cardiac, and phrenic nerves; and the right lymphatic trunk. The subclavian vein, if greatly distended, may overlap its lower border, but the innominate vein is below the level of this part of the artery; the anterior jugular vein crosses it transversely, but is separated fi-om Fig. 202.—Deep dissection of the head and neck (from Maclise's Surgical Anatomy).

The Branches of the first part of the subclavian artery are (1) Vertebral, (2) Internal Mammary, and (3) Thyroid Axis. The Superior Intercostal artery arises from the first part of the sub- clavian on the left side, but on the right is usuaUy a branch of the second part, and is concealed by the inner border of the scalenus anticus. 1. The Vertebral Artery (Fig. 203, i) is seen now in only a small part of its course. It arises fi'om the posterior part of the upper border of the subclavian (occasionally from the aorta on the left side), and runs upwards in fi'ont of the transverse process of the 7th cervical vertebra, Ij-ing in an interspace between the scalenus anticus and the longus colli muscles. In front of it are the inferior thyroid artery, the middle cervical gangHon, two minute branches from the mferior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic, and the internal jugular and vertebral veins. It enters the foramen in the transverse process of the 6th cervical vertebra, and passes thi'ough the vertebrarterial foramina in all the vertebrje'above, inclining outwards to reach its passage on the atlas, then winding inwards upon the atlas to enter the foramen magnum and supply the brain It IS about 2 inches in length between its origin and the point at ^^ch It enters the vertebrarterial canal.

The Vertebral vein, much smaller than the arteiy, commences in small branches about the foramen magnum and atlas. It takes the same course as the artery, receiving corresponding branches, and also the ascending cervical and deep cervical veins, and, after emerg- ing from the foramen in the sixth vertebra, is joined by a small tributary which runs through the foramen in the seventh vertebra, and crosses the subclavian artery to open into the innominate vein. It sometimes escapes through the foramen in the transverse process of one of the other cervical vertebras. 2. The Internal Mammary Artery (Pig. 2Q3, 13) arises from the lower part of the anterior sm'f ace of the subclavian ai-tery, on the distal side of the vertebral below the origin of the thyroid axis, and at once descends behind the clavicle into the thorax. It is crossed superficially, and from without inwards, by the phrenic nerve close to its origin. The artery passes behind the costal cartilages of the true ribs, giving oii a romes nervi phrenici, anterior intercostal, mediastinal, pericardiac, and perforating branches, and finally divides opposite the seventh cartilage into two terminal branches— superior epigastric and musculo-phrenic. These will be fm-ther seen in the dissection of the thorax. The artery is accompanied by venoi comites, which unite above and join the innomiaate vein. 3.

It divides immediately into three branches, (a) inferior thyroid, {h) transversalis coUi, and (c) supra-scapular. a The Ivferior Thyroid artery (2) runs first upwards and inwards across the vei-tebral artery and behind the carotid sheath and sjto- pathetic trunk. It curves inwards and downwards opposite the transverse process of the 6th cervical vei-tebra, then descends as far as the lower border of the thyroid body, and after passmg inwards behind the recurrent laryngeal nerve it tui-ns upwaixls, formmg a second cui-ve, and breaks up into branches which supply the thj-roid body and anastomose with the superior thyi-oid artery (Fig. 208).

It is rehited in /runt to the platysma, the cervical fascia, the clavicuhir origin of the sterno-mastoid, and the scalenus anticus; and behind to the apex of the pleura, the scalenus medius, and the ascending part of the fii-st thoracic nerve. Aboiv it are the cords of the brachial plexus, and below is a small portion of the inner border of the first rib. The Subclavian vein is below the level of the artery at this point, and separated from it by the scalenus anticus. The only branch of the second part of the sub- clavian artery is the superior- 'intercostal artery on the right side, the left artery usually arising on the inner side of the anterior scalenus. The Superior Intercostal Artery (Fig. 203, 7) springs from the posterior part of the superior border of the subclavian about a thii-d of an inch external to the origin of the vertebral. It runs upwards for a short distance and after dividing into two branches, the first intercostal and the deep cervical, descends into the thorax in front of the neck of the first rib, giving branches to the first inter- costal space, and anastomosing with the upper intercostal artery from the aorta in the second space. The intercostal branch, besides supplyhig the first and second intercostal spaces, gives off posterior spinal and mmculur branches after the maimer of the aortic inter- costals. The deep cervical branch passes upwards and backwards between the neck of fii-st rib and the transverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra, to be distributed to the muscles of the nuchal region, and to anastomose with the princeps cervicis of the occipital and muscular branches of the vertebral between the com- plexus and semispinalis colli. The Superior Intercostal Vein opens into the innominate vein on the left side, after crossing the arch of the aorta and communicating with the left upper azygos vein; on the right side it ends in the vena azygos major. The Third Part of the Subclavian Artery has been dissected m the posterior triangle of the neck (p. 3S2). The Subclavian Vein is the continuation of the axillai^ vein and has been seen to lie anterior to but below the level of its artery' It passes over the groove on the first rib in front of the scalenus anticns; and runs in front of the apex of the pleura and a little below the first part of the artery, and joins the internal jugular vein o form the innominate.

It is closely related to the lowest of the deep cervical glands, and is endangered during the operation for the removal of these. It is sometimes double. It conveys the whole of the lymph of the body, with the exception of that passing through the right trunk. The Right Lymphatic Trunk drains the right side of the head, neck, and chest, the right pleura and lung, and the right side of the heart; and terminates in the right subclavian vein. The Pneumo-gastric Nerve (Pigs. 205 & 206) (10th nerve) is only seen in its cervical portion at present. It is enclosed in a separate compartment of the carotid sheath, lying between and behind the jugular vein and common carotid artery, and enters the superior apertui-e of the thorax on the inner side of the phi-enic nerve, passing, on the right side, between the subclavian artery and the innominate vein, and on the left side between the-common carotid and subclavian arteries, and behind the innominate vein. Its Superior Laryngeal branch (14 & g) springs from the ganglion of the trunk below the jugular foramen, and running forwards beneath the internal carotid artery, appears opposite the hyoid bone, and pierces the thyro-hyoid membrane to supply the mucous membrane of the larynx. Before entering the larynx the nerve gives a smaU external lanjmjeal branch, which runs obliquely downwards, along the upper border of the inferior constrictor and beneath the sterno-thyroid muscle, to supply the crico-thjTOid, one of the intrinsic muscles of the larynx. It gives ofe also some filaments to the inferior constrictor and sometimes a small cardiac branch. The Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve (26 & 21) (inferior) is seen run- ning upwards along the side of the trachea, between this and the oesophagus, and after passing under cover of the lateral lobe of the thyroid body, disappears beneath the lower border of the inferior constrictor. It Hes superficial to the ligamentous band wluch fixes the lateral lobe of the thyroid body to the upper tracheal rings, before passing beneath the constrictor (Pig. 208). Its course diflers on the two sides of the body; on the right it arises fi-om the pneumo-gastric in the neck, below the subclavian artery, and wmds behind that vessel; on the left it arises in the thorax, and tm-ns m like manner round the ai-ch of the aorta external to the ductus arteriosus. It gives off cardiac, tracheal, and oesophageal branches,THE SYMPATHETIC. 423 and twigs to the inferior constrictor, and supplies all the intrinsic muscles of the larjTix except the crico-thyroid. It communicates b}^ a small filament with the superior larpageal nerve. The Cardiac (17) branches of the pneumo-gasti-ic are superior, given off high in the upper part of the neck, and joining the sym- pathetic ; and inferior, arising a little above the upper ojjening of the thorax, through which they pass to join the cardiac plexuses. The PharyiHjeal branch and some small communicating branches arising at the upper part of the nerve are not yet visible. The Hypoglossal Nerve (Fig. 205, 9) (12th nerve) after com- municating with the vagus, the first and second cervical nerves, and superior cervical ganglion, appears below the posterior belly of the digastric muscle, hooking round the sterno-mastoid artery, and curving forward superficially to the great vessels. It afterwards passes beneath the stj'lo-hyoid and posterior belly of the digastricus close to the hyoid bone, and is then seen in the angle between the two bellies of the digastric muscle, lying upon the hyo-glossus below the lingual branch of the fifth; finally disappearing beneath the posterior border of the mylo-hyoid muscle to supply the muscles of the tongue (Eig. 206, 11). Its recui-rent meningeal branch comes off in the anterior condyloid foramen, and supplies the dura mater. Its descending Iranch (ramus descendens cervicis) arises opposite the occipital artery, and runs downward and forward either upon or within the carotid sheath, and forms a loop {ansa hypoglossi) with one or more branches fi-om the 2nd and 3rd nerves of the cervical plexus, the communicantes cervicis (Fig. 199, 7). The nerre to the thyro-liyoid muscle is a very delicate branch given off from the 12th nerve just before it passes beneath the digastric. This and the last, as weU as the branch to the genio-hyoid, are to be traced to the communication fi-om the 1st and 2nd cervical nerves. The Sympathetic (Figs. 205 & 206) in the neck lies behind the carotid sheath upon the prevertebral muscles. It is a slender greyish cord bearing thi-ee cervical ganglia, of which only one can now be seen. The middle cervical or thyroid ganglion (23 & 24), small and t)ften scarcely distinguishable, lies opposite the 6th cervical vertebra, and usually over the first loop of the inferior thyroid artery. From this ganglion branches of communication go to the fifth and sixth cervical nerves ; thyroid branches arc distributed upon the inferior thyroid artery ; the middle cardiac nerve (the deep or groat cardiac nerve) passes into the thorax, and some small twigs^ run to the424 THE SIDE OF THE NECK.

The Spinal-Accessory Nerve (Fig. 205, 5) (11th nerve) after passing generally superficial to, sometimes beneath the internal jugular vein, appears below the digastric muscle and crosses over or just below the extremity of the transverse process of the atlas. It pierces the deep surface of the sterno-mastoid muscle, giving branches to it, and then crosses the posterior triangle, running upon the levator anguli scapulce to reach the trapezius, which it sujiplies. In the_ sterno-mastoid it communicates with the nerve from the cervical plexus to that muscle, and in the posterior triangle and trapezius it is joined by branches fi-om the third and fourth cervical nerves. The Cervical Plexus (Kg. 199) is formed by the anterior branches of the four upper cervical nerves, but the loop from the 1st nerve to the 2nd is of very small size, and cannot be well seen in this stage of the dissection. The 2nd, ;jrd, and 4th nerves appear between the rectus capitis anticus major and the middle scalenus, lying beneath the sterno-mastoid. Each of these nerves communi- cates with the one above and below it, and gives off superficial and deep cervical branches. The superficial branches of the cervical plexus have been already dissected in the posterior triangle, and can now be traced to their sources,—the great auricular, small occipital, and superficial cervical branches to the 2nd and 3rd nerves, and the descending branches to the 3rd and 4th nerves. 4.

The Phreiiir iitrrc (ii) arising from the 4th nerve (or from the 3rd and 4th) receives a branch of communication fi-om the oth, and runs downwards upon the scalenus anticus, getting to its inner border at the lower part of the neck. It then crosses in front of the first stage of the subclavian artery and the root of the internal mammary artery, and behind the innominate vein, to enter the thorax. It communicates here with the sympathetic, and also, frequentlj', with the nerve to the subclavius fi'om the brachial plexus, and wiU subsequently be traced to the diaphi'agm in the dissection of the thorax. The Trachea is now sufficiently exposed for the examination of its relations in the neck, but its stmctm'e must be studied later. It is about 4A inches in length and extends from a lower border of the sixth cervical vertebra to the lower border of the fourth thoracic vertebra, where it bifui'cates into the bronchi. It is longer dm'ing the act of deglutition, and dming the production of high notes in vocalisation, owing to the wider separation of its component rings by the elevation of the larynx, and it is also stretched to some extent when the cervical vertebrte are extended. In frokt of it in the neck lie the isthmus and pyramidal lobe of the thyroid body, the sterno-hyoid and sterno-thyroid muscles, the cervical fascia, the upper part of the remains of the thymus, the ' infeiior thyi-oid veins, and the thyroidea ima artery when this vessel exists. Laterally it is in close relation with the lateral lobes of the thyroid body, and the recurrent larjmgeal nerves run in a groove on each side between it and the oesophagus. Posteriorly it IS attached by connective tissue to the anterior wall of the oesophagus. It is invested by a connective tissue sheath. The CEsophagus also commences at the lower border of the 6th cervical vertebra below the lower border of the inferior constrictor, and passes into the chest after a very short course. In the neck it has f ront the trachea (jjrojecting somewhat beyond it on the left side), thyroid body, the left recuiTent laryngeal nerve, and the left common carotid artery. Behind are the vertebrre and the longi colli, and on the left side is, in addition, the thoracic duct. The recun-ent laryngeal nerve runs in a groove between it and the trachea. The Thyroid Body is a solid ductless organ embracing the front and sides of the trachea. It is composed of two lateral lobes con- nected by an isthmus. The isihmm is half or three-quarters of an nich 111 depth, and lies opposite the first thoracic vertebra, iu front ofTHE SIDE OF THK NECK. 428 the second and third tracheal rings, and behind the sterno-hyoid and sterno-thyroid muscles and anterior jugular veins. It is commonly crowned with a small process of glandular tissue called the Fig. 208. pijramiilid luhe* which stretches upwards a little to the left of the middle line towards the hyoid bone; and it occasionally receives a few muscular fibres passing to it fi'om the hyoid bone, and known Fig. 208.—The thyroid body and its rehitions (\V.

The lateral lobes are about two inches in length, somewhat conical in form, with their apices upwards, and lie by the sides of the trachea from the level of the . second thoracic vertebra to the lower part of the ala of the thjToid cartilage: they extend farther above than below the isthmus. Each lobe is in relation anteriorly with the sterno-hyoid, sterno-thyroid, omo-hyoid, and sterno-mastoid muscles, the anterior jugular vein, and the integiunent and fasciae; posteriorly with the lougus colli, and the common carotid (slightly), inferior thyroid, and vertebral arteries; internally with the lower part of the larjiix and pharjTix, the ti-achea and oesophagus, and the recurrent laryngeal nerve; externally with the carotid sheath. Its base aiDproaches the dome of the plem-a, and its (qwx lies upon the inferior constrictor by the side of the cricoid and thyi'oid cartilages under cover of the sterno- thyroid. The whole organ is invested by a capsule, which is connected above with a suspensory ligament rmining fi-om the isthmus to the body of the hyoid bone, and at the sides with lateral lifjaments, which are attached to the extremities of the fii-st and second tracheal rings, and sometimes to the lower part of the thyroid cartilage. The recurrent laryngeal nerves run upon the latter. It is abundantly supplied with blood by the superior and inferior thyroid arteries of each side; and occasionally by an additional branch, the thyroidea ima, which may come from the innominate, the right common carotid, the aorta, or more rarelv, fi-om the right internal mammary or right subclavian. The arteries freely anasto- mose in the substance of the body, and retimi their- blood by three veins on each side, viz., the superior and middle thyroid, which join the internal jugular vein, and the inferior thvroid, which may be traced down the fi-ont of the trachea to the innominate vein. * Its nerve supi% is derived from the middle cervical ganglion. The thyroid body is composed of numerous closed vesicles con- tammg a yellow fluid. Supplementary thyi-oids are not infrequently found in the neighboiu'hood. The Face. The face is a region in which it will be convenient to make different dissections on the two sides, i.e., of the muscles and vessels on one, and of the nerves on the other; and the dissectors are therefore advised to adopt this method of proceeding. Before commencing the dissection, the student should obsei-vethe external anatomy of the eye and its appendages, so that these may be seen m as natural a condition as possible (Eig. 209).430 THE FACE. Ou the margin of the orhit is the sujyerdliiim or eyebrow, a ridge of thickened skin covered -with hairs. The eyelids or pitlp<-hra; are two thin folds composed of a dense fibrous tissue (the so-caUed tarsal cartilage), and of muscle and fascia; covered externally by the skin, and lined internally by the conjunctiva palpebrarum continued from the sm-face of the eyeball. The pouits of junction of the two lids are called the inner and outer cantlii, and along the free borders of the lids will Pig. 209. be seen the riJia or eyelashes, which curve upwai'ds from the upper, and downwards from the lower lid. Before opening the lids they should be drawn forcibly oiit- ward towards the temple, in order to make tense and pro- minent the Httle tendo oridi or internal palpehral ligament, by which their inner extremities are attached to the nasal process of the superior maxilla. A smaller and less distinct external palpebral ligament passes from the outer extremities to the fi'ontal process of the malar bone, at the outer edge of the orbit. n .1, -c * The margins of the lids present the eyelashes and the onfices of the Meibomian glands, and are so bevelled that, when they are closed, a canal, triangular in section, is left between them and the globe of the eye, and serves to convey the tears to the mner canthus. The lids being separated, a small semHunar depression called the lacas laehrymalis will be seen at the inner canthus, and on the free margin of each lid close to this a Uttle emmence papdla lachnj- malis) perforated by a minute hole, the punctam lachrymak- (9).

The lachrymal sac, situated in the groove in the lachrymal bone between the tendo oculi in front and the tensor tarsi muscle behind, is a deHcate fibrous receptacle, wider above than below, and continuous inferiorly with the nasal duct. It is lined with mucous membrane having a ciliated epithelium. The cajm- liculi may be opened up upon the probe with a fine-pointed pair of scissors, when a good-sized probe may be readily introduced into the sac, and pushed down into the nasal duct and inferior meatus of the nose.

An incision is to be made fi-om the temple in fi-ont of the ear, along the jaw to the chin (the scalp having been already dissected), and the skin is to be carefully reflected towards the median line. A cut around the orbit and mouth wiU avoid interference with the eyelids and lips. The position of the various muscles may be ascertained from the two following figiu-es ; they, as well as the vessels, are to be care- fully preserved, but the small nerves are to be cut away, together with aU the loose fat.

The Orbicularis Palpebrarum (Fig. 213, 4) is a broad muscle surrounding the orbit. It arises from the internal palpebral liga- ment (('. p. 430), from the nasal process of the superior maxilla above and below the Hgament, and fi-om the internal angular process of the fi-ontal bone. Its fibres surround the orbit and are attached to the skin; and those passing over the Uds (the palpebral fibres or palpehra/is muscle), are in part attached to the external tarsal ligament externally. A few fibres constituting the aiian/ bundle of Eiolan He on the inner side of the bulbs of the lashes. On the outer side of the orbit, the muscular fibres adhere to the frontal process of the malar bone and to the adjacent temporal fascia in such a manner as to represent an external attachment. Accessory fibres join the orbicularis fi-om the occipito-frontalis, and two sHps (m. malaris) are given off, one on each side, from the lower border of the muscle to the integument of the cheek. The orbicularis palpebrarum is the muscle which closes "the eye- lids, and is therefore the direct antagonist of the levator palpebral its orbital fibres wimkle the skin around the lids. The upper half of the muscle is capable of acting independently of the lower In'lf its power of compressing the globe is serviceable in violent wcopin-." or in other conditions in which the ocidar vessels arc distended with blood.

Fig. 212. outwards is inserted into the orbicularis about the centre of the eye- brow, some fibres reaching the deep surface of the integument. It draws the eyebrow downwards and inwards, and produces vertical wrinkles (as in fa-owning) in the middle of the brow. The Pyramidalis Nasi (Fig. 212, i) is a small slip of muscle Ij-ing along the nasal bone, continuous with the occipito-frontalis above, and joining the tendon of the compressor naris below. Taking its fixed point from below, it di-aws down the integu- ment over the root of the nose, pro- ducing central transverse wrinkles. Acting from above it probably aids the action of the compressor naris upon the nostril. The Levator Labii Superioris Alseque Nasi (Fig. 213, 8) arises from the upper part of the nasal pro- cess of the superior maxilla close to the margin of the orbit; it widens as it descends, and divides into two slips, which are inserted into the deep sui-- face of the upper part of the curved integumental furrow bounding the ala of the nose, and into the upper lip, where it is attached to the skin and blends with the orbicularis and levator labii superioris. The action of the muscle is expressed by its name. The Compressor Naris (Fig. 212, 3) is to be traced beneath the preceding muscle to its origin from the canine fossa of the superior maxiUa. The muscle is triangular in shape, and passes forwards, spreading in a fan-Hke manner to join the pyramidalis above and Fig. 212.—Muscles of tlio nose (from Wilson, after Arnold). Pyramidalis nasi.

It is intimately connected with the skin, but glides over the superior lateral cartilages. It is probably a dilator of the nostril. The Depressor Alae Nasi (Pig. 212, 7) is a small muscle, which should be exposed by everting the lip (at a later stage) and removmg the mucous membrane. It arises txom the mji-tiform fossa over the incisor teeth of the upper jaw, and is inserted info the posterior part of the colunma and the ala of the nose. It contracts the aperture of the nostril. The Levator Labii Supe- rioris Proprius (Fig. 2ia, 9) arises from the superior maxiUa and margin of the malar bone above the infra- orbital foramen, and is in- serted into the upper hp, blending with the outer side of the levator labii superioris alseque nasi, and its inner- most fibres may be traced beneath this muscle to the back of the wing of the nose.

The Levator Anguli Oris (Fig. 213) arises from the canine fossa of the superior maxilla immediately below the infra-orbital foramen, and passes downwards and outwards beneath the pre- ceding muscle to the angle of the mouth, joining the fibres of the orbicularis oris and zygomatici, some passing into the lower lip. It raises the corner of the mouth and assists in elevating the lower lip. The Zygomaticus (Fig. 213) is either a smgle muscle, or has two slips forming the zygomaticus major and miaor. The Zygomaticus major (ii) arises from the malar bone close to its junction with the zygoma, and passes obliquely to the angle of the mouth, where it blends with the orbicularis oris, the levator and depressor anguli oris, and the skin. The Zygomaticus minor (lo), much smaller, arises fi'om the malar bone in front of the preceding, and is inserted between it and the levator labii superioris, with which it unites. The Orbicularis Oris (Fig. 213, 7) is the sphincter muscle sur- rounding the mouth. It is joined by all the other muscles which are inserted into the lips: in fact, the fibres from the bucciuator. risorius, levator anguli oris and depressor anguli oris, constitute the major part of the so-called ' orbicularis.' It is attached on each side to the septum of the nose by a small slip (naso-labiaUs) (Fig. 212, g), and by two other accessory fasciculi to the superior maxiUa close to the incisor tooth, and to the lower jaw close to the canine tooth. The true orbicular fibres are difficult to demonsti-ate. Its action is to pucker and protrude the lips as in whistling. On the side of the jaw wiU be seen the insertion of the Platysrua Myoides, continuous more or less with the orbicularis oris at the angle of the mouth, and with the muscles below the lip. Occa- sionaUy there is a strong skin muscle, probably an appendage to the platysma, passing transversely from the fascia over the masseter to the angle of the mouth, called the Risorius Muscle of Santorini. This draws outwards the corner of the mouth, and acting with its fellow compresses the lips. The Depressor Anguli Oris (Fig. 213, 13) (triangularis menti) is a triangular muscle arising horn the outer sui'face of the lowei jaw, below and a Uttle externally to the mental foramen and i,rserted into the angle of the mouth, some fibres passing m o he upper lip, and decussating with the levator augidi oris, it not oSy depresses the angle of the mouth, but draws the upper hp slightly downwards. . ,j,.„f„< The Depressor Labii luferioris (Fig. 213, 12) (^^^^^^ menti) arises from the oblique line on the outer sm-face of the lower437 THE PAROTID GLAND. jaw, between the symiihysis and the mental foramen. Its fibres run upwards and inwards to tho lower lip, some crossing the midfUo line and decussating with those of the opposite muscle. A median triangular interval is left between the two over the chin. It is a depressor of the lower liji. The Levator Menti (Pig. 213, 14) is a triangular muscle placed internally to the depressor of the lower lip, arising fi-om the incisive fossa of the lower jaw and running downwards and forwards to be inserted into the skin of the chin. It is best dissected by everting the lower lip and removing the mucous membrane. It is an elevator of the chin and lower lip. AU the muscles of the face are supplied by the facial nerve. In health the muscles of the two sides of the face antagonise one another, and an equilibrium is unconsciously maintained; but should the nerve of one side be divided, or become paralysed from any cause, the balance of power will be destroyed, and the face is at once cb-awn to the healthy side by the preponderating muscles. The Parotid Gland is the largest of the salivary glands, and is placed in front of the ear. Its superficial part overlaps the masseter muscle, reaching as high as the zygoma and as far back as the mastoid process, and below, it is separated from the submaxillary gland by the stylo-maxillary ligament. An anterior lobe, more or less detached fi-om the rest, lies upon the masseter and is known as the socia parotidis. The deep portion presents three processes; one occupies the posterior part of the glenoid fossa (glenoid lobe), the second accompanies the internal maxillary artery beneath the lower jaw (pterygoid lobe), and the third passes backwards beneath the sterno-mastoid, and reaches the root of the styloid process and the deep vessels and nerves of the neck (carotid lobe). The duct of Stensou (ductus Stenonis) is about 3 inches in length. It arises from tho anterior part of the gland below the socia parotidis, and receiving a small duct from the latter passes transversely across the masseter, and tm-ns sharply round in front of this muscle to open into the mouth through the buccinator muscle, opposite the second molar tooth of the upper jaw. Immediately below tho duct is the buccal branch of tho facial nerve, and above it the transverse facial artery. The gland is traversed by the external carotid artery which gives off its two terminal branches (temporal and iutornal maxillary), as well as some parotid and masseteric twigs in its •substance; by the transverse facial artery; by the tomporo- inaxiUaiy vein; and by the pes aiiserinus of the facial nerve branch"r/r^'^'^'r""^ "'7' ""''^ and a branch of the great auricular nerve (cervical plexus) supplies the43S THE FACE. skin over it, and penetrates into its substance. The structure of tlie parotid is that of a compoimd racemose gland, like other salivary glands. It receives arteries from the temporal arterj' and external carotid, and its special nervous supply from the amiculo-temporal and sym- pathetic, as well as from the facial, glosso-pharyngeal, and gi-eat amic^ilar nerves; of these the most important is the glosso- pharyngeal, which either gives o& (by means of its tympanic branch) the small superficial petrosal nerve, or sends a branch of communication to that nerve, if it comes off from the facial nerve. The small superficial petrosal nerve passes forwards to join the otic ganglion, which communicates with the auriculo-temporal, and from the latter are given off branches to regulate the secretion of the gland. The gland is covered by a fascia, the parotideo-mnsseteric, which joins in front of the masseter with the hmco-pharymjeal aponeurosis, an investment of the superior constrictor and buccinator. [The remains of the ]5latsvma are to be removed to show the facial artery and vein in front of the masseter, and the arteij is to be followed out to the inner angle of the eye, with as little mjiu-y to the muscles as possible.] The Facial Artery (Fig. 214) [external carotid], the cervical portion of which has been already dissected (p. 412), appears on the face immediately in front of the masseter muscle, where it lies on the lower jaw anterior to the facial vein, and is crossed by the platysma. It then becomes very tortuous, and passes upwai-ds and inwards beneath the zygomaticus major to the side of the nose, lyino- upon the buccinator, levator anguli oris, and the levator labu superioris muscles in its course. At the side of the nose it is crossed by the outer portion of the levator labii superioiis nlreque nasi, and reaches the angle of the orbit to anastomose with the nasal branch of the ophthalmic artery. This is therefore one o the points of communication between the external and internal carotid vessels.

The Angular artery (21), which is the terminal branch and anastomoses with the nasal branch of the ophthalmic. The Facial Vein (Fig. 195) commences at the inner angle of the orbit in the angular vein, formed by the frontal and supra- orbital veins. It then runs in a straight course obliquely across the face to the edge of the masseter, where it lies close to the outer side of the artery, and, after receiving the deep facial or anterior internal maxillary branch from the pterygoid region, and tiibutaries corresponding to the branches of the artery, passes into the neck. There it is joined by the inferior labial and facial communicating veins and forms the common facial, finally ending in the internal jugular vein. It is crossed by the zygomaticus major miiscle, but lies upon Stenson's duct, and in the neck is superficial to the submaxillary gland. Its tributaries do not run with the arterial branches correspond- ing to them in name. The superior labial vein collects a number of small branches from the upper lip and runs upwards to join the main vein near the wing of the nose, the inferior labial in like manner runs obliquely downwards and enters the facial trunk below the jaw. The deep facial joins the vein while it is crossmg the buccinator, and establishes a communication with the deep pterygoid plexus and through this with the cavernous sinus. The Transverse Facial Artery (Fig. 214, 12) arises from the temporal artery in the parotid gland, and appears on the face above the parotid duct, to run transversely inwards below the zygoma towards the infra-orbital region, anastomosing with the facial, buccal, and infra-orbital arteries. In a well-injected body the terminations of the infra-orbital and iuforior dental arteries will be found emerging at the infra-orbital and mental foramina, with branches of the 2nd and 3rd divisions of the. 5th nerve. The infra-orbital foramen will be found between the levator labii superioris and levator anguli oris, and the mentalTHE FACIAL NERVE. 441 foramen beneath the depressor anguli oris. The frontal and supra- orbital arteries shotdd also be traced, if the scalp has not already been fully dissected {r. p. 3(51). The Transverse Facial Vein terminates in the temporal or temporo-maxillary vein. The Lymphatics of the face cannot be demonstrated in the com-se of an ordinary dissection, but some small glands (pre- auricular) may be seen in the fascia covering the parotid gland. They di-ain the cheek and lateral frontal region, while the mid- frontal region and the greater part of the face are drained by the suh-maxiUary glands, which lie beneath the angle of the jaw. The lymphatics of the parieto-occipital region end in the mastoid and sub-occipital glands, which Ke a short distance below the superior cm-ved line of the occipital bone and its continuation on to the temporal bone. [The skin being removed fi-om the opposite side of the face in the same way as above directed, a dissection is to be made of the nerves alone, all other tissues being sacrificed for that purpose. To find the facial nerve, the best way is to cut transversely into the parotid gland about half an inch below the zygoma, and to dissect carefolly to some depth until some large branch of the nerve, which passes through its substance, is reached. One having been found, it is to be followed carefully backwards and forwards, when it will lead to other branches; and the parotid gland is to be removed piecemeal to show the ramifications of the nerve, which are then to be traced as far as possible towards the median line.] The Facial or Seventh Nerve (Fig. 215, 17) leaves the skull at the stylo-mastoid foramen, and gives off immediately the posterior auricular, dic/astric, and stylo-hyoid branches. The posterior uurindar nerve (13) winds below the meatus to the back of the ear and communicates with the great auricular nerve (23). It divides into an auricular branch, which supplies the posterior and sometimes the superior am-icular muscle, and an occipital branch, which suppUes the posterior belly of the occipito- frontalis and unites with the small occipital nerve. The difjastric and stylo-hyoid verves (21) supply the posterior belly of the digastricus and the stylo-hyoid. A branch from the digastric nerve perforates the digastric muscle and communicates with the glosso-pharyngeal nerve, and the stylo-hyoid nerve communicates with the sympathetic on the external carotid. Passing forwards deeply in the parotid gland, the facial nerve divides into two large portions, the temporo-facial (22) and the cervico-farial (ig), from which numerous branches arise, causiuo by their interlacement the appearance termed the pes anserinus or442 THE FACE.

The temporo-facial division receives communicatiiig branches from the aiuiciilo-temporal nerve (5th) in front of the pinna, and the cervico-facial division receives one or two branches from the great auricular nerve of the cervical plexus.

These branches all ramify upon the face, to supply the facial muscles and communicate with the several divisions of the oth nerve, excepting the iufi-a-maxillary, which runs below the jaw to the neck and communicates with the superficial cervical nerve (31). The branches are to be traced to all the "muscles of expression," and also to the bu(!cinator, a muscle of mastication as well as of expression. The distribution is somewhat irregidar, but commonly the maJar ends in the orbicularis palpebrarum, the temporal supplies all the muscles above the palpebral fissure, including the upper part of the orbicularis, as well as the anterior and superior auricular; the hi fro-orbital, all the muscles between the palpebral and labial fissures, including the lower part of the orbicularis palpebrariim and upper part of the orbicularis oris. The huccal nerve supplies the buccinator and ends in the orbicularis oris, the infra-maxiilary is distiibuted to the muscles of the lower lip, and the supra-maxillary to the platysma. All the facial muscles receive sensory branches from the divisions of the 5th nerve. The three divisions of the 5tli Nerve appear upon the face (Fig. 215). The First or Ophthalmic Division appears (1) as the sitpra- trorhlear nerve (6) at the inner angle of the orbit; (2) at and internal to the supra-orbital notch as the mipra-orhital nerre (8), which has been traced to the forehead ; (3) as the lachrymal verve, below the external angular process ; (4) as the infra-trochlear nerve, emerging below the pulley of the superior oblique; and (5) as the nnaal verve (18), which will now be found emerging from between the nasal bone and lateral cartilage, on the side of the nose. These supply the structui'es of the vertex, anterior temporal region, forehead, upper eyelid, and part of the nose. The Second or Superior Maxillary Division appears (1) the infru-o'ihital nerve (20) at the infra-orbital foramen, betw, the levator labii superioris and the levator anguli oris, and is to be traced to the upper lip, which it suppHes with numerous large kiUul branches, fonuing a plexus with the facial nerve • it as eon isTHE FACE, 444 also sends nasal branches to tbe wing of tbe nose and palprhral twigs to the lower eyelid ; (2) as the malar brunch of the teinporo- malar nerve (14), appearing through the malar bone after piercing the outer wall of the orbit; and (3) as the temporal branch 0/ the temporo-malar nerve (10) piercing the temporal fascia immediately above the zygoma {v. p. 361). Branches 2 and 3 supply the soft parts over the malar bone and anterior part of the temporal region. The Third or Inferior Maxillary Division appears (1) as the 7nental nerve (32) at the mental foramen, and is to be ti-aced to the chin and lower lip ; (2) as the buccal nerve (26) upon the sui-face of the buccinator muscle, where it will be found supplying the skin and mucous membrane of the buccal region and some filaments to the muscles, commmiicating with the facial nerve; and (3) as the auriculo-temporal nerve (3), passing beneath the parotid gland and running upwards over the zygoma immediately in front of the ear, to supply the mid-temporal region. These are all pui-ely sensory nerves. They joia freely with the facial nerve, and supply sensation to the muscles; to part of the mucous membrane of the buccal cavity; and to the whole of the skin of the face, except that covering the parotid gland, which is supplied by the great auricular nerve of the cerVical plexus. [The anatomy of the eyelids and of the nasal cartilages can be examined on either side of the face, by removing the superjacent tissues.] The Eyelids (Fig. 209).—These have been partially described on page 430, but may now be fui-ther investigated. On removing the thin palpebral fibres of the orbicularis fi-om the lids, th.emperwr and inferior palpebral ligaments will be seen extending from the margin of the orbit. They are continuous with the periosteum of the skull at the orbital margin, and are attached to the convex edge of the tarsal cartilage in each lid. The tarsal bodies or cart>laf,es consist of dense connective tissue, and according to later observers contain no cartilage. The upper is larger than the lower, and is semilunar in shape. They are attached to the margin of the orbit by the corresponding palpebral ligaments above and below; ex- ternally by the exterml tarsal ligament, and internally by the internal tarsal ligament or tendo ac.uli. The fibres of the orbicularis must be cut away from the tendo oculi, and the attachment of the latter to the nasal process of the superior maxilla, unmediately in front of the groove for the lachrymal sac, will then be seen. Beneath the palpebral ligament in the upper lid will be found tue expansion of the tendon of the levator palpebrte superioris, attachea to the convex margin of the superior tarsal body. Both lids are hnecl445 THE EYELIDS. with conjunctiva, and on removing this the Meibomian glands may be seen embedded in the substance of the tarsi. The structures composing the upper eyelid are— 1.

Bj^ removing the conjunctiva over the inner canthus, the little slip of muscular fibre will be seen arising from the ridge on the lachrjonal bone, and passing behind the lachrjonal sac, to be inserted into the tarsal bodies and canaliculi. It is thus apparent that the lachrymal sac occupies a position between the internal palpebral ligament and palpebral fibres of the orbicularis in fi-ont, and the tensor tarsi behind. Cartilages of the Nose (Figs. 216 and 217).—Only the superior lateral cartilages and the cartilages bounding the nosti-ils can now be seen, but the cartilage of the septum will be examined later, in the dissection of the nasal fossse. The sujjerior lateral mrtiJaije is triangular, its posterior border being in contact with the opposed border of the nasal bone and nasal process of the maxilla, and its anterior border intimately imited with the anterior edge of the cartilage of the septum. The inferior lateral mrtikuje is an elongated plate, so bent upon itself that while the angle between the two parts forms one half of the point of the nose, the two parts themselves surround the anterior part of the nostril, the inner Hmb uniting with the septum. It has no attachment to bone, but is embedded in the dense cellular tissue of the ala nasi. There are frequently two or three little additional nodules of fibro-cartilage, sesamoid cartilages, which prolong the outer part of this cartilage backwards along the upper part of the alar fuiTow, but the greater part of the wing is composed of fibrous tissue. The inferior cartilages of the two sides are in contact at the tip of the nose, and are attached to the superior lateral cartilages by fibrous tissue. AU the nasal cartilages except the sesamoid nodules are of the hyaline variety. The Pterygo-Maxillary Eegion and Zygomatic Fossa. [The head being laid on one side, the facial nerve and parotid duct are to be divided and turned forward, and the remains, if any, of the parotid gland are to be cleaned'out from between the ear and the jaw, the auriculo-temporal nerve being carefully preserved. The surface of the masseter muscle is then to be cleaned.] The Masseter (Fig. 213, 15) is the most superficial muscle of mastication, and is divisible into a superficial and a deep portion, a small part of the latter being seen behind the fibres of the former. The superficial and more tendinous part arises from the anterior two-thirds of the lower border of the zygomatic arch, formed by the maxillary, malar, and temporal bones; it passes downwards and447 THE TEMPORAL MUSCLE. backwards, to be inserted into the angle of the jaw and the lower half of the ramus. The deeper and more fleshy part arises from the posterior thii-d of the lower border and from the whole length of the inner sm-face of the zygoma; it extends downwards and a little forwards, to be inserted into the. outer siu'face of the upper half of the ramus of the jaw, including the root of the coronoid process. [The temporal fascia is to be detached from the upper border of the zygoma, and a cut is to be made with the saw thi-ough the malar bone in front of the masseter, and behind it thi-ough the zygoma, as near its root as possible without injuring the temporo- maxillary articulation. The piece of bone with the masseter at- tached can then be turned down, when the deeji fibres of the muscle will be seen attached to the lower jaw, and the masseteric branch of artery and nerve will be found emerging thi-ough the sigmoid notch behind the coronoid process, and must necessarily be divided. The temporal muscle is to be cleaned and the fat beneath the masseter removed, so as to expose the buccinator muscle thoroughly, together with its branch of nerve and artery which appear in fi-ont of the coronoid process and are to be preserved.] The Temporal Muscle (Fig. 223, 2) arises from the whole of the temporal fossa, except the anterior wall formed by the malar bone; by deep fibres from the pterygoid ridge on the great wing of the sphenoid; and fi-om the rmder sui-face of the temporal fascia, which has been seen to be attached to the whole length of the temporal ridge. Its anterior fibres are nearly vertical, the posterior nearly horizontal; they converge to a tendon, which is inserted into the apex, anterior and posterior borders, and inner surface of the coronoid process, extending along the inner surface of the ramus of the lower jaw nearly as far as the last molar tooth. [A section is made by the saw downwards from the anterior margm of the neck of the jaw parallel to the posterior border of the ramus, as far as a level with the alveolar process. A second section is caiTied horizontally forwards from this point in such a way as to detach the gi-eater part of the ramus with the coronoid process but leaving a narrow line of bone connecting the condyle with the an<-le Un turning up the segment with the temi)oral muscle the zvffomatic lossa IS well exposed. ^ On removing the portion of ramus thus separated, the periosteum wm probably be left behind, and on this being dissected away, the KfprnlV '''''^ r^'^'-y seen lying on the internal lateral ligament before entering the dental foramen, and in front of these the lingual (gustatory nerve.

If superficial to the muscle the artery shoidd be cleaned and held aside with a hook.] The External Pterygoid Muscle (Fig. 218, i) arises by two heads, one from the outer surface of the external pterygoid plate and tuberosity of the maxilla ; the other from the under surface of the great wing of the sphenoid below the pterygoid ridge. Its fibres run backwards and outwards, converging to be inserted into the hollow on the front of the neck of the lower jaw, and into the capsular ligament and inter-articular fibro-cartilage of the joint. Temporo-Maxillary Articulation.—The joint surfaces are sui-rounded by a aipsuh which is thickened externally, internally and posteriorly to form the external lateral, short internal lateral, and posterior ligaments. It is connected to the circimiference of the inter-articular fibro-cartilage, and gives insertion to some of the fibres of the external pterygoid. The external lateral ligament (Fig. 219, 5) is a short thick band of fibres, broader above than below, and passes obliquely downwards and backwards from the lower border of the preglenoid tubercle to the neck of the jaw. The short iidcrnal lateral ligament (Henle) runs from the margin of the Glaserian fissure to the inner side of the neck of the jaw. The 2Wsterior ligament (Sappey) consists of elastic fibres which are attached above to the post-glenoid process, and below to the posterior border of the articular cartilage and to the posterior sm-face of the neck of the bone. It is stretched during depression of the jaw, when the condyle advances upon the eminentia articularis. By dividing the Hgaments, the inter-articular cartilage and the synovial membranes above and below it wiU be brought into view. The inter-articular fihro-cartilage (Fig. 220, 3) is adapted to the glenoid cavity and eminentia articularis above and the condyle of the lower jaw below, its upper sui-face being concavo-convex from before backwards, the lower surface concave. If the condyle is detached from the temporal bone and tui-ned forward with the external pterygoid muscle, the cartUage wiU be found to be oval m outline and thicker at the margins than in the centre, where iti. occasionally perforated (6).

The Buccinator (Pig. 223, 14) has been partly seen in the dissection of the face. It arises from the alveolar border of the superior maxilla opposite the two posterior molar teeth; from a corresponding portion of the inferior ;naxilla ; and between the jaws from the anterior border of the pterj^go-maxillary ligament, which separates its fibres from those of the superior constrictor. Its inner siu'face is lined with mucous membrane, and externally it is related to the maxdla and to the sucking pad of cheek fat. It is inserM into the lips and angle of the mouth, joining the orbicularis oris, and probably becomes continuous with the opposite muscle in the middle line of both lips. Its upper and lower alveolar fibres will be seen to pass to the upper and lower lip respectively, while the mtei-mediate fibres from the pterygo-maxillary ligament decussate, the superior passing to the lower lip, the inferior to the upper.* The fibres are perforated by the duct of the parotid gland opposite the second molar tooth of the upper jaw. The principal action of the buccinator is to keep the food between the teeth diu-ing mastication. It also expels air from the mouth (and hence the name "trumpeter"), as in using the blowpipe; and the muscle acting with its fellow aids in the expression of the face, by cU-awing out- wards the corners of the mouth and pressing the lips tightly too-ether and against the teeth. " The Pterygo-Maxillary Ligament (Fig. 224) is a somewhat mdistmct fibrous line, resembling a tendinous intersection or raphe rather than a ligament, and extending between the hamular process of the internal pterygoid plate and the lower jaw, close to the last molar tooth. By its anterior border it gives attachment to the buc- cinator, and by its posterior boi-der to the superior constrictor of the pharynx; its inner sui'face, covered by mucous membrane, may thus be regarded as a boiuidary line between the cavities of the mouth and the phaiynx. The muscles of mastication are aU supplkd by the motor portion of the third division of the 5th nerve, except the buccinator, which although receiving a branch from this nerve, derives its motion from the facial nerve (7th), as is shown by the fact that in facial paralyses the buccinator fails in its action, and food collects between the teeth and the cheek. The nerve to the internal pterv-oid IS G G 2452 THF, PTRRYGO-MAXILLARY EKGION. given off from the trunk of the nerve, before its suhdivision into anterior and posterior hranclies, and is closely connected with the Otic ganglion. • The Internal Maxillary Artery (Fig. 222) is seen in this dissection in its first and second portions, the tHrd lying m the spheno-maxillary fossa. It is one of the terminal branches of the external carotid artery, and arises in the parotid gland immediately behind the neck of the jaw. The First Part of the internal maxillaiy artery, with its accom- panying veins, passes forwards between the neck of the jaw and the internal lateral ligament. It gives off a descending branch, the Tnfmor dental, and three ascending branches, theMnldle memngeal, tympanic and deep auricular, and sometimes a smcdl memngeal. a The Inferior dental artery (n) descends between the internal lateral ligament and the lower jaw to the inferior dental foramen, living off, before it enters the bone, a mylo-hyoid branch and a small twig to accompany the lingual (gustatory) nerve; it then rims in the inferior dental canal, supplymg the posterior teeth, and after giving an incisor hrauch to the front teeth, appears on the face a! the meutal artery at the mental foramen, with the mental S-anch of the third division of the 5th nex-ve. Its .nylo-hyo.d M pierces the internal lateral ligament in company wi h a nerve of the same name, and runs in a groove on the internal sm-face of the lower jaw to the cutaneous siu^face of the mylo-hyoid and to the anterior belly of the digastx'icmuscle, joining the sub-mental artery. m SL/e meniZjeal ar^er, (7) ascends on the deep surface of the'extei^al pterygoid muscle, ^^^^^^^ ts::s^vrte ~i.pino^^ it enters the skull (Fig. 224, n).

It gives off the posterior superior dental artery, which enters one of the foramina on the posterior surface of the superior maxilla, runs in the bone, supplying it and the molar teeth, and giving off twigs to the antrum, gums, and buccinator. The [nfra-orbital Artery (4) may be seen running into the back part of the spheno-maxillary fissui'e to reach the infra-orbital canal. It gives anterior dental branches to the incisors, canine, and bicuspids, and emerges at the infra-orbital foramen upon the face, where it supplies muscles and integument, and anastomoses with the alveolar, facial, and transverse facial arteries. The Internal Maxillary Vein receives branches corresponding to those of the artery, and between the muscles foi-ms the pterygoid plexus, which communicates with the facial vein by the deep facial rein, and with the ophthalmic vein and the cavernous sinus by means of the veins coming from the orbit, and through the foramen Jacerum medium. The internal maxillary vein finally enters the parotid gland, to join the temporal vein and form the temporo- maxillaiy vein. \ The Inferior Maxillary Nerve (Figs. 223 and 224) (3i-d\ division of oth), emerges from the foramen ovale, lying in front of the middle meningeal vessels and external to the otic ganglion. After giving off the nerve to the internal pterygoid and a small recurrent branch, which passes thi'ough the foramen spinosum with the middle meningeal artery and supplies the mastoid ceUs and great vnng of the sphenoid, the trunk breaks up into anterior motor and posterior sensory divisions, each of which, however, contains both motor and sensory fibres. The Motor Division (Fig. 223) is of small size. It is placed externally to the sensory portion, and is distributed to the muscles of mastication, running with the corresponding branches of the mternal maxiUary artery. Its branches are, anterior and pos- terror temporal (4 & 5), masseteric (9), external ptery,,oid and I'urral (8). I J.I ^ ■The temporal branches run outwards and upwards in the temporal muscle and supply it. A third temporal branch is occasionally present. The masseterir branch passes over the sigmoid notch to enter the deep surface of the muscle, and supplies articular branches to the temporo-maxillary articulation. The nerve to the external pterygoid passes between the two heads, giving a branch to each. Lastly the hnccal nerve, the only branch that is not motor IS very large and distinct, and commonly arises with the anterior deep temporal. It enters the muscle, supplying sensory filament456 THE PTEBYGO-MAXILLARY REGION. to it, and to the mucous membrane and integument investing it, and communicates with the buccal branch of the facial. The Sensory Division (Fig. 224) breaks up, close to the base of the skull, into three branches, the Lingual Nerve the most anterior ; the Inferior Dental Nerve (which has some motor fibres) in the middle; and the Auricido-Temporal Nerve posteriorly. [The auriculo-temporal nerve is to be carefuUy dissected out from the tough fibrous tissue of the articulation, and traced through tHe parotid to the pinna and temple.] The Lingual or Gustatory Nerve* (Fig. 224, 16) lies at first between the two pterygoid muscles, and then passes forward be- tween the internal surface of the ramus of the jaw and the mternal pterygoid muscle; it will be afterwards traced to the side and tip of the tongue. Beneath the external pterygoid the nerve is 30ined at an acute angle by the smaU chorda tympani nerve (7), and is connected with the inferior dental nerve by a transverse branch. The chorda tympani is a branch of the facial nerve given oli in the temporal bone, and passes through the tympanum between the handle of the maUeus and the long process of the mens, to emerge through the canal of Huguier at the inner side of the Glaseiian fissure, to which it should now be traced. The Inferior Dental Nerve (Fig. 224, 18) has a branch of com- munication with the Ungual trunk, and then descends with ^e inferior dental artery (p. 452) between the ramus of the jaw and internal pterygoid muscle and the long internal lateraUigament, to reach the dental foramen. After entering the bone it supplies all the teeth of the lower jaw, partly by dii-ect filaments, partly by its incisor branch (22), and emerges at the mental foramen as the mental nerve (24), with its accompanying artery, supplymg sen.oiy fibres to the muscles, mucous membrane, ^i^^/'^t^g;}^^* "^J^ lower lip, and to the body of the lower jaw.

It communicates witli the temporo-facial portion of the facial nerve and with the vti.c ijanglion. The Submaxillahy Eegion. The Suhmaxillary region has been partially dissected with the anterior triangle of the neck. It is triangular in shape, and is bounded by the lower border of the lower jaw above, the mid-line from symphysis to hyoid bone in front, and the body of the hyoid body with the stylo-hyoid and posterior belly of the digastric below. Its floor is formed by the anterior belly of the digastric, the mylo-hyoid, the hyo-glossus, and the middle constrictor. It contains the superficial portion of the submaxillary saUvary gland with its capsule; the submaxillary lymphatic glands; the facial artery, giving ofE its submaxillary, submental, ascending palatme, and tonsillar branches ; the facial vein; the hypoglossal nerve; aud the mylo-hyoid nerve and vessels. It is covered in by the super- ficial and deep fascite, the platysma, infra-maxillaiy branches of the facial nerve, and branches of the superficial cervical nerve. Under cover of the jaw may also be seen in this dissection the stylo-glossus, the stylo-pharyngeus, the superior constrictor, the glosso-pharyngeal and lingual (gustatory) nerves, Wharton's duct, and the ranine vein ; but these do not belong to the triangle. TThe facial artery is to be divided at the jaw, a.nd together with the submaxillary gland turned back, without d/^placmg a deep portion of the gland which lies beneath the posterior pait ot the fnT-hyoidmufcle ; the latter, formingthefloor o the ^ub^xd^^^^^^^ trianale will be exposed, and on its surface will be seen the mylo- hyo^'branch of arLy and nerve derived f™-^J^" ^J^^ trunks, the artery anastomosing with the ^^^^-^^f f, ^t^"teriion facial By cutting thi-ough the digastric muscle at its inseition.

Its contraction raises the whole tongue towards the floor of the mouth, and is thus of importance in deglutition. It is sappJicd (with the anterior belly of the digastric) by the mylo-hyoid branch of the inferior dental nerve. [The mylo-hyoid is to be detached from the lower jaw and turned forward, when three structures will be seen lying in the following order fi'om above downwards on the hyo-glossus muscle, viz., the lingual nerve (5th), the deep portion of the submaxillary glaiul with Wharton's duct and the sublingual gland, and the hypoglossal nerve (12th). In addition, immediately below the 12th nerve there is very frequently a large ranine vein corresponding to a part of the lingiial artery. In front of the hyo-glossus will be seen the genio- hyoid sti-etching between the chin and the hyoid bone, and a few fibres of the genio-glossus, together with the terminal branch (ranine) of the Lingual artery. The jaw should now be divided just externally to the genio-hyoid, when it can be turned up, and the tongue being drawn out of the mouth, the fold of mucous membrane forming fhe/npiiiim /intjiice will be seen, with the horseshoe-like sub- liiif/uat fiihl, on to which open the ducts of Walther, the iiapillu suhnaxiUdris on each side, with the common opening of Wharton's and Eivini's ducts, and the fimbriated folds outside these. The tongue may now be put on the stretch with hooks, and the dissection can be proceeded with by cleaning the deep part of the submaxillary gland and its duct, and raising the mucous mem- brane fi-om the subungual gland, beneath which the duct passes.] The Submaxillary Gland (Fig. 224) consists of two portions, superficial and deep. The superficial part lies in the angle between the two belUes of the diagasti-ic under cover of a portion of the body of the lower jaw. It is related externally to the submaxillary impression upon the inner surface of the jaw and lymphatics, and below this to the facial vein, branches of the facial nerve, and the platysma and integument. Internally its deeper surface rests upon the mylo-hyoid, the posterior part of the hyo-glossus, the lingual vessels, and the hyi^oglossal nerve. The facial artery is embedded in a deep groove in its substance and gives many branches to it: and five or six submaxillary lymphatic glands lie within or upon it. It is separated posteriorly from the parotid gland by the stylo- maxiUary ligament. The rfcep portion of the gland is continuous with the superficial portion around the posterior border of the niylo-hyoid. It lies upon the hyo-glossus and below the mucous membrane of the floor of the mouth, its anterior extremity touching the hinder end of the sublingual gland. The dud (Wharton's) arises from the deep portion and is aboutTHE SUBMAXtLLAHY REGION. 460 two inclies in length. It runs forward upon the hyo-glossus and genio-glossus to open upon the summit of a papilla close to the frasnum linguas. It Ues above the hyijoglossal nerve, and at first below the lingual nerve, but afterwards passes beneath and above the latter. The Sublingual Gland (Eig. 224) is situated beneath the mucous membrane by the side of the tongue, and lies on the hyo-glossus and genio-glossus close to Wharton's duct, into which one of its ducts {dudas Riviiii) opens, the others {duds of Walther) open- ing into the mouth on the crescentic sublingual fold near the freenum (Fig. 249). It is related externally to the sublingual fossa on the mner surface of the lower jaw; internally to the hyo-glossus, genio- glossus, genio-hyoid, Wharton's duct, and the hypoglossal and lingual nerves; Mow to the mylo-hyoid; and above to the glosso- maxilkry reflection of mucous membrane. Its anterior extremity ■ reaches to the freenum and lies in contact with its fellow, and its posterior end touches the deep portion of the submaxillary gland. The apical (jland of Nuhn is a small gland lying under the mucous membrane of the under surface of the tongue near the tip. The Lingual Nerve (Fig. 225, i) (Gustatory of 5th) appears at the anterior border of the pterygoideus internus, where it lies against the pterygo-maxillary ligament, and afterwards runs between the jaw and the mucous membrane of the mouth to reach the hyo-glossus, upon which it is at first placed above Wharton s duct and the 12th nerve. Upon the hyo-glossus it crosses the duct and lies below it, but, if followed to the side of the tongue, wiU be found to pass again between the duct and the hyo-glossus. It is distributed to all the structures of the anterior part of the tongue, to the mucous membrane of the mouth beneath the tongue, to the gums, and to the sublingual gland. Branches of convnun.catwn pass across the hyo-glossus to the hjiioglossal nerve, and a little below the level of the trunk, opposite the deep portion of the sub- maxiUary gland, may be found a branch to the submaxillary ganglion. It is connected with the facial and glosso-pharyngeal nerves through the chorda tympuni (3), and has less important com- munications with the inferior dental nerve and the mylo-hyoiU branch of this. The Submaxillary ganglion (2) is of small size and lies upon the hyo-glossus below the lingual nerve. It has throe roo s, the senso'ry derived from the lingual; the motor from the facial (<tli by means of the chorda tympani, which is prolonged on the lingual461 THE HYPOGLOSSAL NEHVF:. nerve to the ganglion ; and a sympathetic root from the plexus on the facial artery (superior cervical ganglion). The branches of dis- tribution are given to the submaxillary gland, Wharton's duct, and the mucous membrane of the mouth. The chorda ti/mpani is after- wards prolonged to the tongue, conveying the lingual gustatory filaments fi-om the glosso-pharjnigeal nerve, but its distribution there is imcertain. Probably, however, it supplies the fungiform Fig. 225. and filiform papiUfe, and gives a branch to the inferior lingualis muscle. The Hypoglossal Nerve (Fig. 225, 15) (12th) has been seen crossmg the upper part of the anterior triangle, after hooking round the sterno-mastoid artery, to disappear beneath the submaxillary gland and posterior border of the mylo-hyoid.

It gives branches in this part of its course to the stylo-glossus, hyo-glossus, genio-glossus, and genio-hyoid muscles, and also to the Fig. 226. intrinsic muscles of the tongue itself. Its branches and communications are described on p. 423. The Hyo-Glossus (Fig. 226, 6) arises from the outer part of the body of the hyoid bone, from the upper margin of the whole length of its great cornu, and fi'om the lesser cornu. It runs up- wards and forwards, and is ■inserted into the side of the dorsum of the tongue, where its fibres blend with those of the stylo-glossus and lie out- side the inferior lingualis. It is sometimes described as consisting of three separate portions, corresponding to its three attachments to the hyoid bone-basio-glossus, kerato-glossus, and chondi-o-glossus. , On the Older side of the hyo-glossus are the mylo-hyoid, stylo- hyoid, digastricus, and stylo-glossus n.uscles, the ranme vem, the gustatory and hypoglossal nerves, the submaxiUaiT gangbon, the ^ubliugual and deep portion of the submax^ary glands, and Fig. 226.-Styloid muscles and muBcles of the tongue (from Wilson) 1.

On the dvep or inner side are the genio-glossus, the inferior lingualis, the origin of the middle constrictor, the lingual artery with its veu£8 comites, the glosso-pharyngeal nerve, and the stylo-hj'oid ligament. The hyo-glossi draw the tongue downwards and backwards into the floor of the mouth. One hyo-glossus contracting alone, di-aws the side of the tongue downwards and inclines the whole organ towards the side from which the muscle acts. It is supplied by the hypoglossal nerve. The Stylo-Glossus (Fig. 226, 9) arises from near the tip of the styloid process and from the stylo-maxillary ligament, and passmg obUquely forwards and downwards, reaches the side of the tongue, into which it is inserted, the fibres blending with those of the hyo-glossus behind, and with the inferior Hngualis beyond the anterior border of the hyo-glossus. The stylo-glossi raise the margins of the tongue and draw the organ upwards and backwards, retracting it into the mouth when It hasbeenprotinided, and assisting the hyo-glossus and the anterior fibres of the genio-glossus.

It is at farst external to and then beneath the external carotid, and, bke it, is roven-d h/ the sterno-mastoid and platysma muscles, and crossed by the h^moglossal nerve, the occipital and posterior auricular arteries, and the digastric and stylo-hyoid muscles. It then lies beneath he parotid gland and to the inner side of the external carotid, and is separated from the latter by the styloid process, the stylo-pharpi- ge^is muscle, the glosso-pharyngeal nerve, and the phaiTngeal branch of the vagas. Posteriorly it rests against the sympathetac triuik and the rectus capitis anticus major, and is crossed, on the inner side and somewhat posteriorly, by the superior and external laryngeal branches of the pneumo-gastric.

Cranial Nerve (Fig. 229, 4) leaves the skull at the foramen jugiilare, in front and to the inner side of the jugular vein, and in the same dural sheath as the sinnal-accessorj' nerve. It follows the ruternal and common carotid arteries, lying between and behind them and the jugular vein, and in a separate compartment of the carotid aheath. Within the jugular foramen it forms an enlargement called the jugular f/am/lion, or ganglion of the root, from which arises an auricular hrancli (Arnold's nerve); and a little lower but close to the skull it is joined by the accessory portion of the spinal-accessory nerve, and expands to foi-m the large ganglion of the trunk, from which the two following branches can now be traced. The nerve com- municates with the hypoglossal, the spinal-accessory, the glosso- pharyngeal, the loop between the first two cervical nerves, and the uj^per gangHon of the sympathetic (see p. 478). The pharijngml branch (Fig. 206, 3) leaves the upper part of the ganglion of the trunk, and appears to be a continuation of the communicating fibres of the spinal-accessory nerve; it then passes m front of the internal carotid artery to the pharynx, where it joius the pharyngeal plexus (p. 480). The superior laryngeal nerve (Fig. 206, 9) arises near the same point and takes an oblique course, behmd and to the inner side of the internal carotid, beneath the lingual artery and upon the middle constrictor, to the thyro-hyoid membrane. The external laryngeal nerve is a branch of the superior laryngeal. It arises about half an inch below the origin of the latter, and runs downwards and inwards along the upper border of the superior con- strictor to supply the crico-thyroid and inferior constrictor muscles. The cranial branches of the pneumo-gastric will be subsequently described (p. 478). The Spinal-Accessory or Eleventh. Cranial Nerve (Fi"'. 229, 10) leaves the jugular foramen in the dural sheath of the pneumo- gastiic nerve. It gives <;mmunieating branches, at or near the base of the skull, to thetiunk and both ganglia of the vagus, the branch to the lower ganglion of the vagus forming the pharyngeal and supenor laryngeal branches of the latter. The principal or spinal part passes over or under the internal jugular vein, crosses the transverse process of the atlas, pierces and suqipUes the sterno- mastoid muscle, ending in the trapezius after communicating freely with the second, third, and fourth cervical nerves in the two muscles and m the posterior triangle (p. 382). The Hypoglossal or Twelfth Cranial Nerve (Fio- o-^c) emerging at the anterior condyloid foramen, comes forward between472 DEEP DISSECTION OF THE NECK. the pnoiiino-gastrio and spinal-accesaory nerves, being closely united with the ganglion of the trunk of the former nerve. It then passes outwards between the internal carotid artery and internal jugular vein, and crosses both the internal and external carotid arteries. It has branches of communication with the pneumo- gastric, the superior cervical ganglion, and the loop between the anterior branches of the first two cervical nerves, and gives a recui-rent branch to the dura mater through the anterior condyloid foramen. Its distribixtion to the muscles of the hyoid bone and tongue has been already seen (p. 461). The Rectus Capitis Lateralis (Eig. 230, 8) is now seen from the side, between the jugular vein and the vertebral artery. It arises from the upper surface of the transverse process of the atlas, and is inserted into the under surface of the jugular process of the occipital bone. It is supjMed by a branch of the anterior division of the first cervical nerve. It slightly inclines the head lateraUy u-pon the atlas. [Bv carefully removing the rectus lateraUs, the .smaU anterior branch of the first cervical nerve may be found beneath it upon the anterior arch of the atlas, forming a loop with the second nerve. J The First Cervical Nerve (sub-occipital nerve) (Fig. 229) has a small anterior division, which leaves the posterior division on the posterior arch of the atlas. It runs forward beneath the vertebral artery, and Hes on the anterior arch to the inner side of the rectus lateraHs, which it suppKes; it passes in front of the transverse process of the atlas, and foi-ms a loop with the second cervical nerve, from which are given branches of commimication to the pneumo-gastric and the hypoglossal nerves, and to the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic. The Superior Cervical Gang'Uon (Fig. 229, 8) of the sympa hetic can now be seen. It is a fusiform enlargement of the sj-mpathetac nerve, about an inoh in length, Ipng beHnd the internal carotid artery, and upon the rectus capitis anticus major opposite the 2nd and 3rd cervical vertebr«3. It gives branches of commumcatwn to the 9th, 10th, and Uth cranial nerves, to the foui' upper cervical nerves, and to the middle cervical ganglion; and branches of d>s. Mian. (1) to the internal carotid artery, forming the carotid and cavernous plexuses; (2) to the bi-anches of he extern o^^^^^ artery (nervi molles); (3) to the pharyngeal plexus; 1"^ ' fibunents which join the superior I'^^T^geal arteiT; and o) the snperior rardlac verve to the cardiac plexus (Fig. 232). It wiU be much more satisfactorily examined later on from behmd (Ing.PREVERTEBRAL REGION. 473 231, 12). Its branches are very slender and lie in a delicate i^lane of connective tissue, from which they may be readily isolated in a fi-esh subject. Prevbrtebkal Eegion. [The carotid arteries, with the jugular veins and the pneumo- gastric and sympathetic nerves, are to be divided at the level of the top of the sternum, and the trachea with the oesophagus is to be severed a little lower down. The neck is then to be bent forcibly backward so as to make the cut sui-face of the skull rest upon the table, and the oesophagus and trachea, with the vessels and nerves being drawn forcibly forward, the cellular tissue between the pharynx and the front of the vertebral column is to be cautiously tbssected thi-ough, until the under surface of the base of the skull is exposed The saw is now to be applied in such a way that the section will pass verticaUy downwards through both external auditory meatus, and emerge immediately in front of the anterior arch o± the atlas, leaving the anterior part of the cranium and face with the pharynx and principal vessels and nerves, and the hinder part of the skull with the vertebral column and prevertebral muscles, lins section wiU also give a very interesting view of the mulitorti Si 1"" . necessary, slices of the petrosa containing the middle and internal ear may be sawn off for subsequent study.

The Scalenus Anticus (Pig. 230, 2) arises from the tubercle on the inner border and upper surface of the first rib (scalene tubercle) and ascends to be mserted into the anterior tubercles on the trans- verse processes of the 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th cervical vertebrae The phrenic nerve and subclavian vein wiU be found on the anterior .suiface of the muscle, and behind it lie the cords of the brachial and lower part of ^e cervical plexuses, and the subclavia!i aiTery ^'^fl?^^^ Medius (Fig. 230, 7) lies behind the subchwian -tery and the. cords of the cervical and brachial plexuses.

The Scalenus Posticus (Fig. 230), the smallest of the three muscles, arises from a rough mark on the outer surface of the second rib, posterior to the attachment of the seraatus magnus; and is inseiied into the posterior tubercles on the transverse processes of the lowest three cervical vertebras. The scalene muscles are supplied by the cervical nerves before they foi-m the cervical and brachial plexuses. . The Bectus Capitis Anticus Major (Fig. 230, i) arues from the anterior tubercles on the transverse processes of the 3rd, 4th, oth and 6th cervical vertebr:© (thus con-esponding to the inser- tion of the scalenus anticus), and is inserted into the under surface of the basilar process of the occipital bone. The inser- tions of this and the following muscles are very generally damaged by the section of the base of the skull. The Rectus Capitis Anticus Minor (Fig- 230, 4) Hes beneath the preceding muscle, which must be turned aside to show it. It arises fi'om the fi'ont of the lateral mass of the atlas, and partly from its ti-ansverse process, and ascends obliquely inwards to be inscrferJ into the under sm-face of the basilar process of the occipital bone, „ The Eecti Autici are supplied by ?ri™erior Wches'of the first and second cervicul nerves.

The inferior oblique portion (3) arisi's from the bodies of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd thoracic vertebras, and passes obliquely upwards to be inserted into the anterior tubercles on the transverse processes of the oth and 6th cervical vertebrae. The superior ohlique portion (5) arises fi'om the anterior tubercles on the transverse processes of the 3rd, 4th, and oth cervical vertebrEe, and passes upwards and otitwards to be iuserted into the anterior tubercle of the atlas. The vertical portion (6) arises fi'om the bodies of the two or three lower cervical and three upper thoracic vertebrte, and receives sKps from the transverse processes of some of the lower cervical vertebrje. It IS in^eiied into the bodies of the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th cervical vertebrre. The longus colH is supplied by the anterior branches of the cervical nerves. All the prevertebral muscles flex the upper part of the vertebral column, the anterior recti also bending the head at the occipito- atlantal jomt; a muscle of one side acting alone draws the spine to that side, the anterior having also a sHght but similar action uiron the cramum. The scalene muscles, when the vertebrre are fixed- raise the ribs and act as muscles of inspiration. The rectus lateraUs bends the head to its own side. The anterior and posterior Intertransverse muscles may be seen between the transverse processes. The anterior pass between the anterior tubercles of the transverse processes; and the posterior ones wiU be m the dissection of the back separating the anterior and posterior divisions of the cervical nerves at their exit from the intervertebral foramina. The Vertebral Artery wiU be seen between the scalenus anticus and the longus colU muscles, and may be more conveniently traced through the foramina in the ti-ansverso processes now than at an eariier period [r. p. 417). The anterior divisions of the cervical nerves pass behind the vertebral vessels nnd in front of the posterior intertransverse muscles. DlSaECTION OF THE PhARYNX. Before dissecting the anterior half of the skull with the pharynx the dissector should examine tlie fauces and upper part of the pharynx from the mouth. The soft palate, witli the uvula in the inndian hne, will be readily recognised, and passing from the soft palate on each side will be seen the two pillars of the fauces withTHE PHARYNX. the tonsil between them. The anterior pillar extends vertically from the soft palate to the side of the tongue, and is formed by a fold of mucous membrane in which the palate-glossus muscle usuaUy lies. The posterior pillar passes obliquely backwards, to the posterior waU of the pharynx, and is formed by a similar fold occupied by the palato-pharyngeus muscle. The tonsil is generally much shi-unken in a subject which has arrived at this stage of dissection. [The pharynx and upper part of the oesophagus are to be carefully distended with cotton-wool or tow, and the preparation bemg placed with the face downwards is to be secm-ed over a smaU block with hooks, one set of which should draw the ojsophagus down and keep the pharynx tense. The vessels and nerves at the back ot the Ijharynx are to be examined before the pharyngeal structures are dissected.] The vessels and nerves now to be examined have all been seen in part from either the fi-ont or the side in previous dissections. They are now all seen from behind, and this must be borne m mind, or the description will be misunderstood. The section of the base of the skull is seldom precisely similar on the two sides, and it will generally be found advisable therefore to trace the parts first brought into view on one side; and the carotid artery, etc.. on the other, as in the illustration (Fig. 231). The Sympathetic Nerve (Fig. 231), with its superior and middle cervical gangba, is at once exposed, and some of its branches may be very conveniently traced. The Snperror cervical ganglion (12) has been described on ^'The Middle cervical gamjlion (18) is of smaU size, and is connected with the 5th and 6th spinal nerves. It lies upon the cui've of the inferior thyroid artery opposite the sixth cervical vertebra and o-ives off (1) thyroid branches upon the inferior thyroid artery, r2) the middle carddac nerve (Fig. 232). and two or three descending branches of convniimication, which pass in front of and behmd the first portion of the subclavian artery to form a loop known as the ansa Vicussenii, and join the inferior cervical ganglion. The Inferior cervical ganglion lies below the transverse process ot the last cervical vertebra and upon the neck of the fii-st nb and may be seen just above the first portion of the subclavian artexj between the origins of the vertebral and superior intercostal arterie., and behind the inferior thyroid artery. It receives conm,an rations from the 7th and 8th cervical nerves, and from the middle cervical and first thoracic ganglia. Its branches of distribuhon are twoTHE INTERNAL JUGULAR VEIN. 477 filaments to the vertebfcal artery, branches to the subclavian artery, and the inferior cardiac nerve to the deep cardiac plexus. The Twelfth or Hypoglossal Nerve (Fig. 231, lo) is necessarily cut off at the anterior condyloid foramen in making the dissection, and should therefore be traced from below, where it will be found m relation with the occipital arteiy. The nerve has been described on jjp. 423 and 461. The Internal Jugular Vein (Pig. 231, 8) is exposed at its oiigm.

The Spinal - accessory Nerve (Fig. 231, 6) emerges from the foramen jugulare, where it is closely connected with the pneumo - gastric nerve, and may be traced to the deep siu'f ace of the stemo- mastoid muscle. The Pneumo - gastric Nerve (Eig. 231, 4) leaves the foramen jugvilare in the same sheath as the spiiial- accessoiy nerve, with which it has communicating branches. Two ganglia are fomid upon the pneumo-gastric nerve, viz., the superior or gangUon of the root, and the inferior or ganglion of the trimk (see p. 471). The ijuiujlhiu of the root is very small, and is placed hi the jugular foramen. It has minute branches of com- munication with the glosso- Ijharjnigeal, spiiial-accessory, and superior cervical gang- lion, and gives off a nxiirreid iiicin'vgeal ImiiicJi to the dui-a mater and an aurhtildr branch (.lJ-)K)7d's nerve).

The (/aii(/7ion of the trunk is thi-ee-quarters of an inch long, and of a pink colour, and has branches of communication with the spinal- accessory, hypoglossal, superior cervical gangHon, and the loop between the fir.st and second cervical nerves. It gives oft' pharyno-eal and superior laryngeal branches, which have been described at p. 471. The cerviral ninliac branches, two or thi-ee in number, are slender filaments arising a little below the ganglion of the trunk ; com- municatiiig usually with the external larjnigeal, and ending on the left side in the superficial canliac plexus, and on the right in the deep plexus. The Glosso-pharyngeal Nerve (Fig. 231, 2) lies in a little special notch in the lower border of the petrous bone as it leaves the jugular foramen, and is separated from the tenth and eleventh nerves by a process of dura mater. Its further coiu-se has been already traced (pp. 406 and 468). It presents two .small ganglia, one at the upper part of the fora- men, the sn2>eriur or Jugular f/uug/ion, which is of very smaU size and the other at the lower part of the foramen, which is larger, and is caUed the inferior or pet.rnus gang/iou ov gamjlion of Amhrsch (Fig. 232, 2). • ■ The upper gangHon involves only some of the fibres of the nerve but all pass through the lower ganglion.

A muscular branch to the stylo-pharyngeus, probably derived from the spinal-accessory. 3. Pharyixjenl branches, which assist in forming the pharyngeal plexus, and supply the constrictors and mucosa. The motor fila- ments probably come from the spinal-accessory communication. 4. Tonsillitic branches to the tonsils and the soft palate, forming the plexus or circulus tonsillaris. 5. LiiKjaal branches, which have been before traced to their termination (p. 46(i). [By cautiously cutting away the temporal bone with the bone- forceps so as to open the cavity of the tympanum, the dissector may, in a favoui-able subject, see some of the branches of Jacobson s nerve on the inner wall of this cavity.] The Tiimpairic branch of the cjlusso-pharijmjeal nerve (Jacobson's nerve) (Fig. 232, g) arises from the petrous gangUon, and enters an apertm-e in the ridge of bone between the carotid foramen and the jugular fossa. It pierces the floor of the tympanum and o-rooves the promontory on the inner wall of the cavity, giving branches to the fenestra ovalis (12), the fenestra rotunda (13), and the lining membrane of the tympanum and Eustachian tube (11). The communirating branches are thi-ee in number: one jommg the carotid plexus in the carotid canal (10); the second to the great superficial petrosal nerve (15); and the thii'd rvmning through the temporal bone to the otic ganglion, as the small superficial petrosal ''^Opportunity may be taken at this point to examine the ossicles of the tympanum (p. o07). > . , , , ■, The Pharyngeal Plexus (Figs. 231 and 232) is to be found upon the middle and inferior constrictors of the pharynx, it svinnlies the constrictors and sends branches to the mucous mem- brane of the pharynx, tongue, and larynx^ Minute ganglia arc sometimes seen on the nerves.

The artery takes a tortuous coui-se in the temporal bone and cranium, making two sigmoid tui-ns, one, the longer, in the petrous bone, and the other by the side of the sella turcica in its petrosal curve; it lies in close relation to the anterior inferior part of the inner wall of the tjTnpaimm, and in this part of its course is more or less smrounded by a plexus of nerves derived from the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic, The Ascending Pharyngeal Artery has been described at ]). 468.

It is fixed to the base of the skuU above and merges into the oesophagus below, at the level of the lower border of the sixth cervical vertebra. Its lateral borders are curved forwards and are attached in succession to the internal ptery- goid plate and its hamular process, to the pterygo-maxillary Uga- ment (or becomes directly continuous with the buccinator), to the posterior extremity of the mylo-hyoid ridge of the lower jaw, to the stylo-hyoid Hgament and the lesser and greater cornuaof the hyoid bone, and to the thji-oid and cricoid cartilages. It is also connected by accessory slips to the soft palate and side of the tongue. The pharynx is about six inches in length. It lies flat agamst the vertebral column and prevertebral muscles in the greater part of its extent, curving forward only at its lateral attached borders. It does not form a " sac " in the strict sense of the term. Its mucous membrane is described on p. 486. The Inferior Constrictor (Fig. 234, 17) is the lowest and most superficial of the three muscles of the pharynx, the upper oblique border overlapping the middle constrictor, which m tm-n overlaps the superior constrictor. It arises from the ala of the thyroid carti- lage behind the oblique line, from the inferior cornu of the same cartilage, and from the side of the cricoid cartilage below the facet for articulation with the inferior cornu of the thyroid ; some of its fibres often passing into those of the crico-thja-oid. All the fibres are inserted into the median raphe ; the highest ascend somewhat steeply, sometimes reaching the pharyngeal spme and are closely related to the external laryngeal nerve, while the lo^yest fibres are horizontal and are continuous with the upper fibres of the oesophagus. The recurrent laryngeal nerve passes beneath the lower border of the inferior constrictor; the superior laryngeal nerve and artery intervene between it and the middle constrictor above; and he external laryngeal nerve runs along its attached border beneath the sterno-thyroid to reach the crico-thyroid. , , , i„ The Middle Constrictor (Fig. 284, 11) is a ^^--^^ .TZ^ ,risin<, from the upper surface of the great cornu ot the hycnd bone from the lesser cornu, and from the stylo-hyoid hgament.

The fibres curve backwards, leaving an interval above, between the muscle and the base of the skull, in which tho fibrous aponeurosis of the pharynx is visible ; and are wsc.vied into the median raphe and pharyngeal spine, being overlapped at tho lower part by the middle constrictor and sometimes also by the inferior consti-ictor. The stylo-pharyngeus muscle is related to it laterally, and passes between its lower fibres and the upper portion of the middle constrictor. The levator palati muscle and the Eustachian tube cross obliquely inwards above the upper curved border, and the palatine branch of the ascending pharyngeal artery follows the same course. The three constrictors are sapjMed by the pharyngeal plexus of nerves, and the inferior by the external and recuiTent larj^ngeal nerves in addition. Their chief action is to contract above the portion of swallowed fluid or food in such a way as to force it in the direction of the stomach, and this they are able to accomplish even against gi-avrta- tion. The palatal fibres of the superior constrictor have also the important function of shutting off the communication between the nasal and buccal portions of the pharynx during deglutition, and are aided in this by the contraction of the palato-phai-j-ngei, which bring together the posterior pillars of the fauces. The superior, akaost vertical, fibres of the inferior constrictor help to raise the larynx and lower part of the pharynx. The Stylo-Pharyngeus Muscle (Fig. 234, 7) has akeady been seen at its origin, and can now be followed to its insertion by dividing some of the fibres of the middle constrictor. It arises horn the root of the styloid process of the temporal bone, and passes downwards by the side of the superior constrictor, then beneath the upper border of the middle constrictor, and expands between the two muscles to be inserted into the median raphe and muscular wall of the lower part of the pharynx, and into the posterior border of the thyroid cartilage. Slender fasciculi may also be traced in some subjects to the upper border of the thyroid cartilage and side of the epiglottis. It is supplied by the glosso-pharyngeal nerve, which winds around it to reach the back of the tongue. Its arfioN is to elevate the lar.>^lx and pharynx; .so assisting m deglutition, or in the production of high notes during vocalisation. The Fibrous aponeurosis of flic I'harfinx is very thin at the lower part, where it lies between the muscular fibres and the mucous membrane, but above the upper border of the superior constrictor it is much stronger, and is expanded from »u\e to side, covenng m the Eustachian tubes and the levatores palati muscles. At the base I485 THE PHARYNGEAL APONEUROSIS. of the skuU It IS attached to the basilar process of the occipital l.ono by a fibrous band (crmrio-jJmrym/m/ lujument), to the Eustachian tube and to the under surface of the petrous portion of the tem- poral bone; and is carried forwards as far as the root of the ptery- goid process and the internal pterygoid plate of the sphenoid bone. The space left between the upper border of the superior constrictor Fig. W and the base of the skull is called the Sinus of Morga-ni • it is raversed by the Eustachian tube, the levator palati, t.l pa'latine arteries, and is clo..ed in by the pharyngeal aponeurosis.

The fibrous aponeurosis is to be detached from the occipital bone on each side and held widely open with hooks, and the whole of the cotton-wool is to be removed from the mtenor ot the pharjnix.] The Mucous Surface or Interior of the Pharynx (Fig. 235) is in communication with the nose, ears, mouth, larynx, and oeso- phagus by the following seven openings named in order from above domiwards: (1 and 2) the two posterior nares [clioanw), separated by the vomer ; (3 and 4) the two Eustachian tubes; (5) the isthmm fancium or opening of the mouth, bounded above by the soft palate, 'below by the tongue, and at the sides by the anterior pillars of the fauces; (6) the superior aperture of the larynx, guarded by the epiglottis ; and (7) the commencement of the oesophagus. The character of the epithelium varies in different situations being squamous below the level of the palate, but columnar and ciHated above that point. Close to the base of the skull is a coUec- tion of follicular glands, extending across fi-om one Eustachian tube to the other, and forming the pharyngeal tomil of Kolhker. In the median line, beneath the basilar process of the occi- pital bone, may be seen a depression called the hirrsa j.harymjea which represents the remains of an opening which, in early foetal life, passes through the base of the cranium mto the pitiutary The opening of the Eustachian tube appears behind the lower part of the apertm-e of the posterior nares, about half an inch posterior to the hinder extremity of the inferior turbmate_ body, and the free extremity of the cartilage forms a distinct projection (tnhal eminence) behind the orifice. Behind the tubal eminence is a deep recess, the fossette of BosenmuUer,^ and below it may Ij seen the rounded ridge of the levator palati descendmg to the soft ^this^?-t?e'^best opportunity for studying the Process of Deglutition.

Lastly, the contraction of the oesophagus carries the food down to the stomach. The Palate. [The soft palate is to be stretched by inserting a hook into the uvula, and the mucous membrane is to be removed from the upper surfaceof the palate and the neighboimng bones, so as to expose the muse es above the palate and the Eustachian tube.

It consists of a strong fibrous aponeurosis attached to the palate bones; a number of muscles connected with the hard palate, the base of the skull, the phar^oix and the tongue ; and a covering of mucous membrane on both its surfaces, that on the oral surface presenting a thick layer of mucous glands. From behmd forwards the soft palate comprises 1. Phar>-n- geal mucous membrane; 2. Thin attachment of palato-pharyni • ofpalato-pharyngei; 6. Tensores palati; 7. Fibrous aponeurosis- 8.

The tendon descends vertically between the supei-ior constrictor and internal pterygoid, to wind round the hainular process of the sphenoid bone, where it is lubricated by a minute bursa ; and then taking a horizontal direction becomes inserted into the transverse ridge on the under surface of the palate bone, and, by means of a strong fan-like expansion of tendinous fibres, into the aponeurosis of the soft palate, meeting with the fibres of the opposite muscle in the middle line. The Palato-glossus lies immediately above the buccal layer ot mucous membrane of the soft palate, and descends in front of the tonsil in the anterior pillar of the fauces, to enter the side of the hinder portion of the tongue. It is attached aoove to the anterior portion of the soft palate, meeting its feUow in the median Ime, and Idow joins with the posterior transverse inti-insic fibres of the tongue The two muscles together form a faucial sphincter. The Palato-pharyngeus (Fig. 236, 9) is attached above to the soft palate and its fibrous aponeurosis by two slips, which are separated by fibres of the levator palati and azygos uvul«, and meet in the middle line with the fellow muscle of the opposite side. It descends behind the tonsil in the posterior piUar of the fauces; its fibres then diverge, and becoming closely connected with those of the stylo-pharyngeus, reach their loiver attachment to the posterior borders of the thyroid cartilage and into the pharynx, blending with the constrictors and extending behind as far as the median raphe. The musole may thus be divided into palato- laryngeal and palato-pharyngeal portions, the latter fonning, with the corresponding fibres of the opposite side, an obhque elliptical sphincter between the nasal and buccal portions of the pharynx. The Salpingo-pharyngeus is an inconstant slip, extending from the cartilaginous portion of the Eustachian tube to }om the outer fibres of the palato-pharyngeus, of which it may bo reg-arded as a part. , , , . Admns.-1h.Q lemtores palati raise the soft palate, and are ot service in vocalisation. They probably have no action upon the Eustachian tubes. The «e«.som palati render the anterior part ot the soft palate tense and resistent, during the passage of the bolus of food beneath it during deglutition ; at the same time they open the Eustachian tubes, their palatal attachment then representing the origin and the tubal fibres the insertion of the muscles. The azygos uvdce shortens the soft palate and uvula. The pa/ato- qiossi narrow the isthmus faucium sphincterieally, and so bring tne gustatory mucous membrane into close contact with the looaMUSCLES OF THE PALATE. 489 during its passage. The palaio-phar/pii/ei draw down the soft lialate, aud, meeting in the middle line, shut off the buccal portion of the pharynx fi-om the nasal portion, and form an inclined plane along which the food can glide. Thej^ are assisted in this action by the palatal fibres of the superior constrictor. The laryngeal and palatal attachments serve equally as fixed points during deglutition, lowering the hinder portion of the palate and raising the larynx and pharynx. The muscles also aid in vocalisation Fig. 236. of high by drawing up the larynx during the production notes. The salpim/o-phnryngei, when present, aid in opening the Ji.ustachian tubes during deglutition.

The soft palate is supplied by posterior branches of the descending palatine artery, which reach it through the accessory palatine canals, by the ascending palatine and tonsillar branches of the facial arterj', and by twigs from the ascending pharyngeal artery. Its nerves are derived from the middle and posterior palatine branches of Meckel's ganglion. The EustacMaii Tube (Fig. 236, 2) is a channel of communi- cation between the upper portion of the pharynx and the tym- panic cavity. It is about an inch and a quarter in length, and nms obliquely downwards, forwards, and inwards, to its jDharyngeal opening. Its walls, in the outer two-fifths of its extent, are formed by the petrous portion of the temporal bone; in the rest of the canal they are composed partly of cartilage, partly of fibrous tissue. The whole length of the passage is lined with ciliated mucous membrane, continuous with that of the tympanum and naso-pharynx. The inner aperture has already been seen (p. 486), as well as the relation of the cartilage to the palatine muscles. The cartilage is triangular in shape, and its large upper end is bent forwards and downwards, the deficiency at the lower part being completed by fibrous tissue. In the recent condition the thick mucous membrane converts the opening into a mere vertical sUt. This is generally closed, but during the process of deglutition it is opened by the action of the tensor palati muscle, aided by the salpingo- pharyngeus when present, and thus the equilibrium of the air in the tympanum is maintained. [ The palate is to be drawn up so as to put the pillars of the fauces on the stretch as much as possible, and the mucous membrane is to be removed to expose the palato-glossus and palato-pharyngeus muscles.] The Amygdala or Tonsil is placed between the palato-glossus and palato-pharjmgeus muscles, and is usually much shi-unken after death. It consists of lymphoid tissue with a niunber of mucous follicles, the orifices of which may be seen on the internal surface. The otitside of the tonsil is in close relation with the superior constrictor of the phtu-jnix and with the ascending pharyn- geal artery, and lies about a third of an inch in front of and to the inner side of the internal carotid artery, opposite to the angle of the lower jaw. [The tongue and the larynx are to be detached by diviiUng aU the structures between theiu and the palate, and are to be carefullyTHE LTPS. 491 liresei-ved for subsequent examinatiou. By inverting the skull the haid palate will then be brought into view.] The Hard Palate (Pig. 240, lo) is continuous with the soft palate, but its mucous membrane is much more dense, and is in- separably united in great part with the periosteum of the maxillary and palate bones. The mucous membrane presents a median ridge indicative of the foetal division of the parts, and is thrown into more or less ti-ansverse folds near the anterior part, where it is prolonged on td the gums. Numerous mucous glands lie imme- diately beneath the mucous membrane, and open upon its surface. The (Jesreiidirifi palatine artery wiU be found emerging from its bony canal a little behind and internal to the last molar tooth. From this point it runs forwards in its groove, giving branches outwards to the gums and inwards to the bone and mucous mem- brane, and anastomoses in front with the naso-palatine artery, which appears through the foramen of Stenson. It is accompanied by its vein, some Ij-mphatics, and the large or anterior palatine nerve. The naso-palatine nerves pierce the foramina of Scarpa, the left in front. The Gums (Fig. 237) are composed of dense fibrous tissue, covered by the mucous membrane of the mouth and inseparably imited with the periosteum of the alveolus. They are prolonged into the sockets of the teeth, and become continuous with the periodontal membrane covering them. The Teeth (Fig. 237) of the upper jaw are 16 in number, viz., 4 mcisors, 2 canines, 4 bicuspids, and 6 molars, the posterior molars bemg the dmtes sapientice or wisdom teeth. Each tooth consists of a crown, a neck, and a fang, and upon extracting a molar tooth it will be found to have three fangs, two being on the outer (buccal) and one on the inner (palatine) side, but in the case of the wisdom teeth these are commonly fused together. The teeth of the lower ja.w correspond in number to those of the iipper jaw, but have been necessarily interfered with in the progress of the dissection. The lower molar teeth differ from those of^ the uijper jaw in jnesenting only two fangs, placed one in front of the other. The Lips (Fig. 237) are covered externally by skin, and are lined internally by mucous membrane amtaining large mucous .'lands and a good deal of lymphoid tissue. Between the skin and nuicous membranes are the muscles already described (p. 433) • some intrinsic muscular fibres passing from skin to mucous membrane through the thickness of the lip; tlie labial veins and lymphatics; and the coronary arteries, the last lying near tlio free border of the lip closeTHE SUPERIOR MAXILLARY NERVE. 492 to the mucous membrane, and anastomosing freely across tlie middle line. A fold of mucous membrane called the fritn um Jahii connects each lip with the alveolus in the median line, and is more jjromi- nent in the upper than in the lower lip. The ScrpERioR Maxillary Nerve. [The skull being placed with the base downwards, a cut with the chisel is to be carried in a straight line from the sphenoidal fissure to the foramen ovale. The side of the skull is then to be sawn thi'ough at right angles to the first incision, meeting it at the fora- men ovale. The saw being then placed obliquely on the malar bone, so that the incision shall pass downwards and outwards from the lower and outer angle of the orbit, the cut is to be carried into the spheno-maxillary fissure. The piece oE bone will now be detached and may be removed, and with the bone-forceps any remaining bone is then to be taken away, so as to expose the whole extent of the superior maxillary nerve.] The Superior Maxillary Nerve (Fig. 237, i) (second division of the oth) leaves the cranium at the foramen rotundum, and, having crossed the upper extremity of the spheno-maxillary fossa, traverses the infra-orbital canal and appears on the face at the infra-orbital foramen. It gives off the following branches :— 1. A small recurrent filament to the dura muter, close to its origm from the Gasserian ganglion. 2. Tcmporo-malar branch (4), which enters the orbit by the spheno-maxiUary fissiu-e, piercing the unstriped muscle {urhitalh) bridging the cleft, and divides into two branches [mahir and temporal), which have been seen in the dissection of the face and .scalp. 3. Spheno-palatine hranrlies, which descend mto the spheno- maxHlary fossa to Meckel's ganglion (6), and become continuous with the descending palatine nerves (p. 500). 4. Posterior dental hranches (2), which supply the gum and adjacent portion of the mucous membrane of the cheeks, and then enter the canals on the posterior aspect of the upper jaw, to supply the molar and bicuspid teeth and the antral mucous membrane and to communicate with the anterior dental nerve. The bicuspid teeth arc sometimes supplied by a separate branch, the middh '^''T. \nterior dental branch (5), which arises fi-om the nerve in the infra-orbital canal, and can only be seen by laying tlie canal open. It descends in a special canal in the wall of the antrum to the incisor and canine teeth, and has a communication with the posteriorTHE TNFRA-ORBITAL ARTERY, 493 dental nerve.

The bones entermg mto it. for- mation are the crest of the nasal bone, the nasal spme o the frontal bone, the large perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone, the vomer, a part of the rostrum of the sphenoid bone, and the crests of the maxillary and palate bones, upon which the vomer rests below. The curtilage of the septum is tiiangular m shape: it fits into the interval between the vertical plate of the ethmoid and the vomer, and extends forward to become connected with the lateral cartilages, and support that portion of the nose which lies beyond the nasal bones. The vomer presents an obhque groove for the naso-palatine nerve, which will be afterwards seen upon the opposite side of the bone.

The Mucous Membrane lining the nasal fossae is termed the pituitary or Schnerderian membrane, and is thickest over the tiirbi- nate bones, particularly the lowest, and on the septum ; but is thin on the floor, and in the sinuses connected with the nose. Over the lower and hinder part of the middle and infeiior turbinate bones the veins of the mucous membrane are much dilated, and very thin-walled. The upper part of the mucous membrane both on the outer and inner walls of the nasal fossa has been named the Olfactory Region, fi'om the fact that the branches of the olfactory or first nerve are distributed to it. It comprises the sui-face corresponding to the superior turbinate bone and the upper half of the middle turbinate bone, and the opposed portion of the septum. It is impossible to distinguish this region from the rest by the naked eye except imme- diately after death, but the mucous membrane is of a yellow colour- in the recent state. Its epithehum is of the columnar variety, and has peculiar spindle-shaped cells connected with the terminations of the olfactory nerve. The remainder of the nasal lining has columnar ciliated cells, except in the neighbourhood of the nostiil, where they are squamous and laminated like those of the skin. The Olfactory Nerve (Fig. 240, a) is the special nerve of smeU, and its branches, which are derived from the olfactory bulb, reach the nasal cavity by piercing the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone, and are disti-ibuted to the olfactory region, i.e., upon the superior and the upper half of the middle tiu-binate bones, and the upper thii'd of the septum. The nerves of common sensation to the nose are derived fi'om Meckel's ganglion, and the internal nasal branch of the first division of the fifth. They will be afterwards dissected. rWith a strong pair of scissors the tiu-bmate bones may be readily cut, so as to expose the several openings into the thi-ee meatnis. The student should observe the small size of the openmgs oi the antrum, the infundibulum, and the ductus ad nasum.] The Nasal Duct communicates between the lachi-j-mal sac and the inferior meatus of the nose, and is directed downwai-ds and sHghtly backwards, and may incline slightly either mwai-ds or outwards according to the lesser or greater breadth of the nasal nassa-e It grooves the superior maxillary, lachrymal, and inferior tiubinate bones, and consists of a fibrous tube, lined with mucous membrane having a ciliated epithelium.

Dissection or Meckel's Ganglion, etc. Before beginning this dissection, the student should ascertain the position of the spheno-palatine foramen (Pig. 239, e), opposite to which the spheno-palatine ganglion is placed, and through which the spheno-palatine vessels and naso-palatine nerve enter the nose. It wiU be found in the post-meatal region, immediately behind and a little above the posterior end of the middle turbinate bone. It is closed by mucous membrane in the recent state. [The mucous membrane Uning the vertical plate of the palate bone is to be removed, without injuring the underlying vessels and nerves passmg through the spheno-palatine foramen. It must also be taken away from the back of the floor of the nasal fossa, and h-om the roof of the mouth behind the level of the posterior dental toramen, m domg which the terminal branches of the descendino- palatine nerve wiU be exposed, and may be traced forward to thS hard palate and backwards to the soft palate. The hard palate is next to be chipped away behind the level of the posterior palatine toiamen; the descending palatme nerves and vessels may then be easily exposed by cutting away with the chisel the thin plate of bone covei-mg them, m a hue between the spheno-palatine foramen and the posterior palatine foramen. By foUowing up the descendino: palatme nerve, Meckel's ganglion wiU be fouml Vposite if the f^T'^- ^^^y P^rts of the body of the sphenoid and other bones sui-rouncHng the space in which the ganghon lies, two branches may be traced'up from the gaTiglion to the superior maxillary nerve, and the Vidian nerve may perhaS be followed backwards through the VicUan canal.] ^ Pei^aps The Spheno-palatine or Meckel's Ganglion (Pig -m ^) a minute pinkish body situated in the spheno-maxillary'fossa opposite the spheno-palatine foramen. Its vrotor and s^p^at/^Hic oots are denved fi^om the Vidian nerve, formed by the j'lmction of the great superficial petrosal branch of the facial with the ereat deep petrosal of the carotid plexus; its sensor,/ root is formed by the spheno-palatme nerves wliich pass downwards from the superior maxillary nerve, and some of which run behind the ganglion to form the palatine nerves. fe<^"guon to The Branches (Pig. 241) of the ganglion are ascending, de- scending, internal, and posterior. 1.

The posterior or small palatine nerve (17), really a branch of the facial nerve passing thi-ough the ganglion, descends through a small canal behind the great nerve, and is distributed to the soft palate and uvula. 3. The internal branches pass thi-ough the spheno-palatine fora- men to the nose, and are the suiJBrior nasal and the naso-palatine nerves. The superior nasal branches (4) supply the mucous membrane of the ui)per and middle turbinate bodies and of the superior meatus. The nasu-palatrne nerve (8) passes throiigh the spheno-palatine foramen and crosses the roof of the nasal fossa to the septum, along which it passes thi-ough a groove in the vomer to the anterior palatine canal. In the canal the left nerve lies in front of the naso- palatine arteries, and the right behind them, and both descend thi-ough the foramina of Scai-pa to the front of the hard palate to unite with the great palatine nerve (Fig. 240, e). 4. The piosterior branches are the Vidian and the pterygo-palatine nerves. The Vidian nerve (3) runs through the Vidian canal in the pterygoid process, and divides into the great superficial petrosal and the great deep petrosal branches. The (p-eat superficial petrosal branch (7) pierces the cartilage which fills up the foramen lacerum medium basis cranii, and runs . m a groove on the surface of the petrous portion of the temporal bone to the hiatus FaUopii, thi-ough which it passes to join the facial nerve. It commimicates also with the glosso-pharyngeal thi-ough Jacobson's nerve. The ,jreat deep petrosal branch (9) joins the carotid plexus upon the internal carotid artery. The ptenj.jo-palatine or pharyngeal nerve (11) is verv small. It pass^es through the pterygo-palatine canal to the mucous membrane ot the upper part of the pharynx, and sends filaments through the cartilage filling the foramen lacerum medium. The Internal Maxillary Artery gives off five branches in the spheno-maxillary fossa: descending palatine. Vidian, ptery-o- palatine, spheno-palatine, and infra-orbital, the last of which has been already examined. All of these are accompanied by branches ot iUeckel s ganghon. ^reat mhir'"'"'' '^"^''^r^::'^ """''^ accompanies the »reat palatine nerve through the posterior palatine canal It ^ives blanches which descend through the smaUer palatine canals to ZTHK EAH. 502 soft palate and uviila, and then rnns forward on the hard palate, supplj^ng it, and anastomosing with the naso-palatine artery in the anterior palatine canal. 2. The Vidian artery accompanies the nerve through the Vidian canal, and supplies the upper part of the pharynx and the Eustachian tube. 3. The pteryiio-palatine artery is very small, and runs backwards through the pterygo-palatiue can^l to supply the upper part of the pharynx, the Eustachian tube, and the sphenoidal sinus. 4. The siiperivr nasal or apheno-palatine artery enters the nose by the spheno-palatine foramen. It gives a naso-palatine branch, and smaller branches to the mucous membrane of the upper part of the cavity, which anastomose with the anterior and posterior ethmoidal branches of the ophthalmic artery. The naso-pxilutine branch runs down the septum of the nose with the naso-]ialatine nei-ve; it supplies the septum, and anastomoses with the artery of the septum fi-om the facial trunk, and with the descending palatine artery after passing through the foramen of Stenson in the anterior palatine canal. The veins correspond, and open into the internal maxillary vem and pterygoid plexus. The Otic Ganglion. rn the part is not too much decomposed, the otic ganglion may be exposed, fi-om within, on the side upon which the mternal ptery- goid muscle has not been cut away. The levator palati muscle and the Eustachian tube are to be carefully removed, when upon the inner surface of the pterygoid muscle wi l^e foimd the neije to that muscle, and this if ti-aced upwards will lead to the gaughon.J It has been described on p. 467. The Ear. The Meatus Auditorius Externus may be examined on the sections made to separate the anterior part of thc skull. with the pharynx, from the posterior segment (p. 475). It is a canal about n inch knd a quarter in length, directed inwards along the trans- verse axis of the cranium, narrowest in the niuMlo, curved in its course with the convexity upwards. It is .lo.ert ilioal y by the luembrana tympani and meu.brane o Shi-apnel . and owSg to the inclination of the axis of the membrane dow - wls and^orwards, the lower wall is longer than the upper, andTHE TYMPANUM. 503 the anterior than the posterior, a point to be recollected in extract- ing impacted foreign bodies. The framework of the outer two-fifths is composed of the cartilage of the pinna; that of the inner thi-ee- tifths of bone (petrosa). It is lined with skin, which is intimately adherent to the periosteum in the bony part of the canal, and presents hairs and ceruminous glands in the cartilaginous segment. A layer of cuticle is reflected on to the fibrous membrana tympani. The meatus receives arteries from the posterior auricular branch of the external carotid, the auricular branch of the internal maxillary, and the anterior auricular branch of the temporal. Its nerves are derived from the great auricular, the auriculo-temporal, and the am-icular branch of the vagus. The deep portion of the passage is related above to the middle fossa of the cranium, ia front and below to the glenoid fossa and vaginal process, and behind to the mastoid process. The Tympanum. [If the tympanum has not been damaged in the previous dis- sections, an attempt may be made to trace the facial nerve through the temporal bone m the following manner. The base of the skuU being tm-ned upward, the saw is to be carried thi'ough a Une di-awn trom the stylo-mastoid foramen to the foramen ovale; or a more ci)mplete view may be obtained by making a vertical saw-cut in the skull, in a line fi-om the interval between the external auditory meatus and the anterior border of the mastoid process towards the mternal auchtory meatus, until the posterior part of the aqueduct of J^ ailopius and the stylo-mastoid foramen are opened. The rest of the bone suiToimdmg the aqueduct is then to be clipped away with bone-forceps. By either of these cuts the tympanum will be divided, and It will be possible to examine its waUs and ossicula, together with the seventh nerve and the chorda tympani.] The Tympanum or Middle Ear is an air-containing chamber situated above the jugular fossa, and intervening between the external auditory meatus and the labja-inth. It is lined with mucous membrane continuous with tjiat of the pharynx, and communicates in front with the Eustachian tube (by wliich'aii- is admitted from the nasal portion of the pharynx), and behind with the mastoid cells through the mastoid antrum. Its transverse diameter is very narrow, from 1 to 3 lines, but its greatest antero-posterior and vertical diameters exceed half an inch (average 7^, lines) mooter wall consists partly of bone, partly of membrane." The i.iembrana tympani, a fibrous structure, is fixed into a narrow gi-oove in an incomplete bony ring, the a>undns f„nrirus, and is connected to the roof of the tympanum at the point of dekciencyTHE TYMPANUM. 504 {notch of Ri villi) in the anniilus by the membrane of Slirajmell, or membrana ilaccida.

The handle of the malleus runs vertically downwards on the inner side of the fibrous laj^er between this and the tympanic mucous layer, and is attached by its extremity to the umbo or centre of the membrane, while the lesser process of the malleus forms a projec- tion at the upper end of the membrane. The external face of the membrane is always concave, and when examined by reflected light shows two bright points, one above, cii-cular, con-esponding to the point of the processus brevis, the other triangular, extending downwards and forwards with its apex at the umbo. The membrane consists of an outer cuticular layer continuous with the cutaneous lining of the external auditory meatus; a middle fibrous layer, the memhruna propria, composed of radiating and circular fibres; and an inner mucous layer, continuous with • the mucous membrane of the tympanum and Hned with squamous non-ciliated epithelium. It is reflected over the handle and lesser process of the malleus and over the chorda tjTiipani. The mem- brane of Shrapnell consists of the cuticular and mucous layers only. The inner wall {Fig. 244) corresponds to the labyrinth and a small portion of the carotid canal. It presents many points for notice:— j 1. The promontonj (ii), an eminence formed by the first turn of the cochlea and grooved by the branches of Jacobson's nerve; its summit approaches within a line or two of the tympanic membrane. 2. The fenestra ovalis (6), an oval aperture with a long horizontal axis placed immediately above the promontory. It is occupied by the base of the stapes and opens into the vestibule. 3. The fenestra rotunda (ig), a somewhat triangular aperture looking backwards and outwards and lying at the back of the pro- montory. It is closed by a membrane {memhrana secundaria) and communicates with the scala tympani of the cochlea. 4 The posterior pi/ramid (8), situated behind the fenestra ovalis, and united to the promontory by a narrow bridge of bone. It is hollow, perforated at its extremity, and transmits the stapedius muscle. 5.

Against it rests the short process of the incus. The fluiir, narrow and irregidar, lies above the jugular fossa aud is pierced by Jacobson's nerve. The roof is a thin portion of bone, separating the tympanum from the middle fossa of the cranium. The upper portion of the tympanic cavity between the ossicles and the roof is called the attic. It is subdivided into two parts, anterior and posterior, by the suspensory ligament of the malleus. The Aqueduct of Fallopius (i), or canal for the facial nerve, forms a slight projection cm-ving behind the pyramid, and is continued above the fenestra ovalis, between it and the eminence of the external semiciixular canal. It extends from the bottom of the meatus auditorius internus to the stylo-mastoid foramen, its coui'se being at first outwards to the inner wall of the tympanum, aud then backwards along the upper part of the wall, lastly downwards to the stylo-mastoid foramen. Ljdng in a bend at the upper part of the canal is the iutiimrsmdut (janyliformis, an enlargement of the facial nerve at the point where it is joined by the petrosal nerves thi'ough the hiatus FaUopii. The facial nerve as it descends behmd the tympanum gives off the chorda tympani and a minute branch to the stapedius muscle (Fig. 237, 14). The Chor<Ja Tympani (Fig. 228, 9) enters the tympanum just below the pyramid, and passes forward across the membrana tympani, between the handle of the malleus and the long process of the Ulcus, to the canal of Huguier, by which it leaves the temporal bone to join the lingual nerve (p. 456). It is invested by a reflection of the mucous membrane of the tympanum, which projects into the tJ^npauic cavity. The Ossicula Auditus (Fig. 243) are the malleus, incus, and stapes. The Maileus (hammer) (b) consists of a head, neck, handle nianubnum), and two processes (processus gracibs and processus brevis). The head looks upwards and articulates by its internal and posterior aspect with the body of the incus; the mmmhriuia is inserted between the mucous and fibrous layers of the membrana tympani, and is directed downwards and slightly forwards, its extremity reaching to the. umbo; the proceams gracilis passes forwards and somewhat downwards, and is inserted into the Glase- nan fissure; the processus brrris gives attachment to the tensor tympani muscle, and rests against the upper part of the membrana tympani. The Incus (anvil) (a) consists of a body aud two processes. The508 THE TYMPANUM. hody articulates -with the head of the malleus ; the short process is attached to the margin of the orifice of the mastoid antrum; the loiuj process is nearly parallel to the handle of the malleus, and has at its extremity a small nodule of bone, the os orhicidare, separate in the foetus, which articulates with the stapes. The Stapes (stii-rup) (d) has a small head and neck, connected to a relatively long oval base by two crura. It is articulated by its head with the long vertical process of the incus, and being at right angles to this is almost horizontal in position. The hase is attached to the fenestra ovalis, but not quite closely, both the base of the stapes and the margin of the fenestra ovalis being coated with hyaline cartilage, and the two suiiaces imited by elastic fibres. The neck gives attachment to the small stapedius muscle. The articulation of the ossicula to one another takes place by means of small capsular joints with synovial membranes. Theu- attachment to the waUs of the tjonpanimi is strengthened by minute ligaments, three of which are fixed to the maUeus and one to the incus. The Muscles of the Tympanum are two in number, viz., the tensor tympani and stapedius; and some anatomists add a laxator tympani, and laxator tympani minor. The Tensor Tympani (Fig. 228, 2) arises from the cartilagmous Eustachian tube and the adjoining sm-face of the sphenoid, and runs backwards in a distinct canal above the processus coch- leariformis, round the margin of which it bends as over a puUey, to be inserted into the root of the handle and the processus brevis of the malleus. It is supplied by a branch from the otic gangUon. The Stapedius arises from the interior of the pyramid, and emerges from its apex to be inserted into the neck of the stapes. It is supplied by a branch of the facial nerve. The Laxator tympani is inconstant. It consists of a few fibres arising from the spine of the sphenoid, and passing through the Glaserian fissure to be inserted into the neck of the malleus. As the malleus and incus swing together round an antei-o- posterior axis, any movement inwards of the membrana tympani must produce a similar though slighter movement inwards of the base of the stapes, and, the cavity of the inner ear bemg fiUed with fluid, a corresponding bulging of the .secondary membrane of the tympanum closing the fenestra rotunda must result. The Inner ear or labyrinth (Fig. 245) consists of three portions, the vestibule, three semicircular canals, and the cochlea. The bony Vestihuh (3) is a little chamber receiving the opening* of the semicircular canals and of the scala vestibuU of the cochlea,THE COCHLEA. 509 and is connected with tlie tjnnpanum by means of the fenestra ovalis. It contains a memhraiioiis restihule divided into two sacs, the ntricle and saccule, upon which are distributed branches of the auditory nerves; the utride receives the vwmhravous sitini- circular canals, the mcode communicates with the scala media of the cochlea by a short tube, the mnalis reuniens, and the two sacs are brought into connection by two little tubes, which unite and Fig. 245. 6 5 4 3 2 1 13 14 l.T 16 are prolonged outwards in the aqueductus vestibrUi as the saccns en dolymph ati'c us.

The Semicircular Canals are called external, superior, and posterior. Each presents an ampvUn at one extremity, and the non-aminiUated extremities of the posterior and superior canals join together, so that there are onh^ five vestibular openings for three canals. Within the bony tubes are the memhranous semicircular canals, which open into the uti-icle, and branches of the auditory nerve are distributed upon their ampullse. The membranous labyrinth contains a fluid called endolymph, and is separated from the bony labyrinth by a distinct space occupied by a fluid called perili/mpji. The STTPERFICI.4.L Anatomy of the ToNoirE. [The tongue and larynx, which were laid aside, are to be examined, without separating them from one another The branches of nerves and the several muscles, which were necessarily divided m removing the tongue, are to be identified before the examination of the organ itself is proceeded with.] The Tongue (Eig. 248) is connected with the os hyoides, styloid process, lower jaw, soft palate, and pharynx by its extriusic muscles (p. 462); and with the epiglottis and floor of the mouth by reflections of mucous membrane. It is supported below by the mylo-hyoids and anterior bellies of the digastrici, and is closely related to the subUngual, submaxillary and apical salivary glands Its dorsal surface is covered by papilte on its anterior two-thii-ds' and presents the prominences and orifices of numerous mucous glands and folhcles behind. The under surface is smooth, and presents at its point of junction with the floor of the mouth a shaiply defined central fold of mucous membrane, the frtenum and a number of apertures connected with saUvary glands The Papillae (Fig. 248) of the tongue" are of three kinds Circumvallate, Eungifoi-m, and Filiform or Conical niepap,lhe Hrmmvullafai (5) are fi-om eight to fifteen in number and are arranged in two oblique rows, which meet in tlie middle hue postenorly at a deep follicle, the foramc. rcvrum, represent- mg the upper extremity of the thyro-lingual duct (pa-e V^H] Each papilla consists of a central eminence, surrounded bv a fjssa and a circular outer wall, and is covered on its free surface with Hecondary papilla.

The papiUce conicce and fiUformes exist all over the tongue, but are most extensively developed at the tip. The conical papillje are covered with minute papillae, and the filiform are prolonged into thread-Kke processes, which in the carnivora are developed into spines. The orifices of mucous follicles may be foimd among the papillae on the dorsum of the tongue, and behind the papiJkv crrcumvallatcn; and along the margin of the tongue, especially opposite the molar teeth, are numerous compound racemose lingual glands, which lubricate the pes- | terior portion of the organ. Some small salivary glands [Ebner's (jlauds) are also found opening on to the dorsum along the line of the circumvallate papiUse. Beneath the mucous membrane is a fibrous layer or corium, which gives attachment to many of the muscular fibres. In the centre of the tongue and dividing it into two symmetrical halves is a fibrous raphe. The Under Surface of the Tongue may be seen by drawing up the extremity of the organ over the upper incisor teeth, when the jaw is depressed (Eig. 249). It presents in the middle line a prominent fold of mucous membrane, the frcenum, and on either side of this, near the tip, some minute orifices of the apical glaiids of Nulin; the ranine vein is visible on each side, a little nearer the Fig. 248.—The tongue with 1.

The Liv(jHulis Trausversiis constitutes the chief bulk of the tongue, and is placed beneath the Kngualis superior. Its fibres are attached to the median septum and pass outwards to the mucous membrane. The Lingualis Verticalis or Obliquns consists of fibres most numerous near the lateral iDorders of the tongue, passing from the upper to the lower free surface. The LvmjiMlis Inferior is to be seen on the under suiiace of the tongue, after removal of the hyo-glossus, lj4ug between this muscle and the genio-glossus. It is larger than the lingualis superior, and extends along the under surface of the tongue, givmg ascendmg fibres which pass between those of the ti-ansverse muscle, and being closely connected with the stylo-glossus muscle. GJamU of Nairn or Blandin.-^j removing the mucous mem- brane on the under sui-face of the tongue near the tip, a couple of oval glands may be seen. They are similar in sti'uctui-e to the sub- lingual glands, although distinct from them, and are sometimes united in fi-ont, forming a single mass of an arched form. The Nerves (Pig. 225) of the tongue have been already exammed. but may now be followed out minutely. They are the Hypoylossal „e)'fe (I'^h) to the muscular structm-e of the tongue; the Li>.;,ii„l verve (5th) to the fimgiform and filiform papiUie on the dorsum and apex of the tongue; the Glosso-pharijmjml un-re (9th) to the oii-cumvallate papillifi at the base of the tongue, to the surface behind them, and to the side of the tongue nearly as far forward> as the tip. The Larynx. The Larynx or organ of voice is closely connected with the hyoid bone and tongue. On tracing the mucous membrane fi'oin the dorsum of the tongue, it wiU be found to fonn three little./™.-« between the base of that organ and the prominent cartilage of the epiglottis; these are the glosso-epigUMidm,, Jolds (Iig.-1!>. 9 . After being reflected o^•er the epiglottis, the mucous membranr runs to the arytasnoid cartilages and forms the two uriiUvuo-epigloiU- deau folds, which bound the superior apertm-e of the larynx; and is then carried to the interior of the larynx and over its posterior surface into the esophagus. . The Superior Aperture of the Larynx (Fig. 2oO) is bounded in front by the epiglottis, behind by the arj-tionoid cartilag:es. and on each side bv the arytfeno-epiglottidcaii tolds. On looking515 THE CRICO-ARYT^NOIDEUS POSTICUS. through it will be seen the Glottis or Mmu Glottulis, I.e., the space between the two inferior or ti-ue vocal cords in front and the two arytsenoid cartilages behind. The glottis varies, according to the movements of the arytenoid cartilages, from a mere chink to a wide triangular aperture with the apex forwards. Above the ti'ue vocal cords lie the less distinct false cords, and thi-ough the glottis may be seen the interior of the trachea., [The larjaix is to be fastened upon a table by driving a nail or pin thi-ough the tongue and putting the trachea on the sti-etch with hooks, the an tenor surface being exposed; the extrinsic muscles of the larynx, the sterno-hyoid, sterno-thyroid, thyro-hyoid, and inferior constrictor of the pharynx, are then to be carefully removed without lujiumg the crico-thyroid muscle or the external laryno-eal nerve, which are now to be cleaned.] ° Intrinsic Muscles of the Larynx. The Crico-thyroid Muscle (Fig. 205, 22) arises from an oval sm-face on the side of the anterior aspect of the cricoid cartilage, and radiates to be inserted into the posterior part of the lower border and inner surface of the ala, and into the inferior cornu of the thyroid cartilage—some fibres joining those of the inferior constric- tor. It IS supplied by the external laryngeal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve (Fig. 251, 18). [The preparation is to be turned over and the mucous membrane IS to be diss^ected off the back of the larynx, the remnant of the a^sophagus being removed. The crico-arj-trenoidei postici muscles on tJie back of the cricoid cartilage are readily dissected ; but in order to clean the CTOss-fabres of the arj-tsenoideus it wiU be necessary to over-distend the larynx so as to stretch the muscle; and this may be most readily done by the finger of an assistant.] ^ The Arytasnoideus (Fig. 250, 4) is an example of a sino-le muscle in the median line; its fibres crossing one another bemg equally cUstributed on each side. It occupies the concave posterior surfaces of the two arytfen.;id cartilages, the fibres passinc from one to the other. The superficial fibres cross obliquely from the apex of one cartilage to the base of the other, and rire rcrsa so as to toi-rn an X, some turning around the outer border of the cartilage to loin the arytrono-opiglottideus or depressor of the op.glotti.s; whilst the deeper fibres pass transversely between he two cartilages, and constitute the avytiPnoidens" proper The uiTtrenoideus is suj,j,Jlnl by the recurrent laryngeal nerve " ihe Crico-Arytaenoideus Posticus (Fig. 2^0, 10) ari<^e, from fh. corresponding half of the posterior snrfLe'of th; 2^^!;;"^: LL 2516 THE LARYNX. and its fibres converge obliquely upwards and outwards, to bo inserted into the posterior aspect of the prominent outer angle of tbe base of the arytenoid cartilage.

A vertical cut is then to be made thi-ough it there with strong scissors or the bone-forceps, and the piece IS to be removed. The larjaix being distended as before, the muscles can be readily dissected.] The Crico-Arytaenoideus Lateralis (Fig. 251, i6) arises horn the upper border of the side of the cricoid cartilage, and its fibres pass obliquely upwards and backwards to be inserted into the anterior aspect of the prominent outer angle of the base of the aryt«3noid cartilage. This muscle is always more or less closely connected with the thyro-arytsenoideus, which is above it, and is supplied by the recui-rent laryngeal nerve. The Thyro-Arytaenoideus (Eig. 251, 14) has a more horizontal direction than the preceding muscle. It arises fi'om the receding angle of the thyi-oid cartilage immediately external to the inferior or true vocal cord, and as far down as the crico-thyroid membrane to which some of its fibres are attached. It passes backwards,' the upper fibres more obHquely than the lower ones, and is inserted mto the lower half of the rough antero-external sm-face of the aryttenoid cartHage, external to the processus vocalis, and by some fibres into the outer surface of the vocal cord. It is sHp2>/ied by the recui-rent laryngeal nerve. [If a second larynx can be procured, a veiT satisfactory way of seeing the thyi-o-arytienoid muscle is to cut the thyroid cartilage homontally at the level of the true vocal cords, when the muscles can be readily displayed unniediately outside them.] The arytainn-epiglottideus consists of a thin plane of fibres which nr:se from the upper part of the antero-external surface of the ai7t,8enoid cartilage, and after reinforcement by some of the super hcial fibres of the arytrenoideus, pass to be inserted into the side of the epiglottis. The inferior portion of the muscle passes in the mucous fol.l foiming the outer wall of the sacculus laryn-is and is known as the amipressor sacruli /ar;/H,jis of Hilton, or ,m,L,m- epiij/nttideits inferior. The thyro-epifihttideus is a small paii-ed muscle arisiu,/ from the receding angle of the thyroid cartilage above thethyro-aryLioideus and v.,,er<«/into the side of the epiglottis. ^ loweus, Actions of the Laryngeal Muscles. The cartilages aiv moved upon one another by the several -uscles, m such a manner as to a,lter either the ens on of the vc|c.l cords or the size of the glottis. The action of these niusele will be better understood, if it be remembered that the c icoSTHE LARYNX. 518 moves upon the thjToid, or rki' vvrsd, around a transverse axis passing through the two crico-thyroid joints, while the aiytasnoids are capable of rotation round a nearly vertical axis, and of gliding movements from side to side and from before backwards. The Orico-thyroidei rotate the cricoid cartilage upwards (or the thyroid cartilage downwards and forwards) and thus tighten the vocal cords by increasing the distance of the receding angle of the thyroid cartilage from the vocal processes of the arytsenoid cartilages. The Tliyrit-aryUmwidei being parallel to, and attached to the same points as, the vocal cords, must necessarily by their contraction relax the cords. The fibres which are inserted into the vocal cords may have the power of dividing them into separately vibrating segments, and so produce a note considerably above the normal register, as in the falsetto. The Cr'icii-arytmwidei postjfi swing the arytfenoid cartilages out- wards, and thus separate the vocal processes and dilate the glottis. This can be easily shown by making traction upon the two muscles simultaneously with the points of a pair- of forceps. The Cricu-arytainoidn laterahs are antagonists to the postici, and approximate the vocal cords, thus narrowing or closing the glottis. The Aryta'Hoideus draws the arytfenoid cartilages together, and thus, according to one view, constricts the glottis; but it may be doubted whether the more superficial fibres, which are inserted farthest out, would not tend to swing the cai-tilages upon theu- axes in such a manner as to widen the glottis. The most superficial fibres, which reinforce the aryttono-epiglottidei, aid the action of those muscles. The thyro-arytcEno-epigloltklei and the aryta-iioideus together approximate the sides of the upper aperture of the larj-nx and depress the epiglottis. . ^ The functions of the laryngeal muscles are hence partly respu-a- tery, partly vocal. In respiration, the glottis is widened by the crico-arytcenoidei postici, and narrowed by the cnco- arytcBnoidei laterales and thyro-aryttenoidei. In mcahsatwn, the preliminary approximation of thb cords necessary for the production of sound having been effected by the two m .sclos .lust named, the cords may bo made tense by the crico-thyroidoi, or lylaxed. as m the production of low notes, by the thyro-arytamoids; and tlie vibrating cords can probably bo segmented by the conti-action o the inneimost fibres of the latter muscles and the note thus elevated above the usual register. The action of the aryta^noideus is uncertain. The alteration of the position of the epiglottis is519 THE VOCAL CORDS. probably of .service iu modulating the sound, but tbe closure of the epiglottis in deglutition is mainlj'- effected by the conjoint action of the reti'actors of the tongue and the elevators of the larynx. [A side view of the interior of the larjmx is now to be obtained by cutting away the crico-arytsenoideus lateralis, with the vocal cords and mucous membrane of the same side, but the cricoid cartilage is to be left entire.] Fig. 252. On a Side-view (Fig. 252) of the interior of the larynx will be seen the horizontal projections of the mucous membrane, caused by the superior and inferior vocal cords. Between the two cords is a depres.sion called the ven- tricle (7) of the larynx, and from the fi'ont of this a jjrobe can be carried into a pouch, the sacculus laryngis, which jjrojects upward between the upper cord and the thyroid cartilage. The mucous membrane is continued from the ventricle into the sac, and is there provided with numerous mucous glands, which provide a secretion for the lubrication of the ti'ue vocal cords. [The mucous membrane is to be cHssected fi-om the vocal cords, and theii- attachments are to be clearly shown.] The "Vocal Cords or Thyro-arytaenoid Ligaments (Fig. 252) are foui- in number, two on each side of the lai-ynx. The superior ligament or false cord (5) has an arched direction, and is much more slender than the inferior ligament. It is attached in front to the receding angle of the thyroid cartilage, and behind ^'ig. 252.—Vertical section of larynx showing its ligaments (from Sappey). 1. Body of hyoid bone. 2. Epiglottis. 3.

The inferior liyanwiit or true cord (9), composed of yellow elastic fibrous tissue and horizontal in direction, is attached in front to the receding angle of the thyroid cartilage below the superior ligament, and behind to the prominent processus vocalis above the anterior angle of the base of the arytenoid cartilage, and is continuous laterally and below with the free upper edge of the crico-thyroid membrane. The glottis or rima c/lottidis is the apertm-e bounded laterally by the true vocal cords in front, and the inter-arytsenoid space behind. The Arteries of the larynx are derived fi-om the superior and inferior thyi'oid arteries. The superior Jarijvgeal artery, from the superior thyi-oid, enters the larynx through the thja-o-hyoid membrane, occasionally thi-ough a foramen in the thyroid cartilage, and divides into ascending and descending branches, which supply the muscles and mucous membrane, and anastomose above with the dorsalis linguse. The inferior laryngeal artery, from the inferior thyi-oid, reaches the back of the cricoid cartUage, and anastomoses with the superior artery above, and with the tracheal branches of the same vessel below. It completes the supply of the laryngeal structures. The Nerves (Pig. 206) of the larynx are the superior and the recurrent laryngeal branches of the pneumo-gastric. The superior laryngeal nerve (9) has been seen to give a branch (external laryngeal) to the crico-thyi'oid and inferior constrictor muscles, and then to pierce the thyi-o-hyoid membrane with the superior laryngeal artery. It suppUes the mucous membrane of the larynx and back of the tongue, and gives a communicating bvanoh to the inferior laryngeal nerve. The recurrent laryngeal nerve (21) is the motor nerve ot the larynx, and has been seen to take a different coui'se on the two sides winding around the subclavian artery on the right, and aroimd the aorta on the left side, but in the larynx the nerves are symmetrical. Each nerve, running up the side of the trachea, passes beneath the border of the inferior consti-ictor of the pharynx and within the ala of the thyroid cartilage, to end in branches to the muscles of the larynx. _ It supplies all the muscles of the larynx except the crico-thyi'oid. rin order to see the ligaments which bind the several parts of th larynx together, it will be necessary to remove cautiously all tU miisciilar fibres and mucous membrane.]521 CARTILAGES OF THE LARYNX. The Th.yro-hyoid Membrane (Pig. 251, 5) connects the upper border of the th3a'oid cartilage with the hyoid bone. It is chiefly composed of yellow elastic tissue, and may be divided into a central portion, and two roimded lateral portions, the Thyro-hyoid liga- ments, passing fi'om the gi-eat cornu of the hyoid bone to the superior cornu of the thyi-oid cartilage, and often containing a nodule of cartilage (cartilage triticea). The central portion is attached above to the posterior siu'face of the upper border of the hyoid bone, a bursa intervening between the membrane and the bone. This allows of the drawing up of the thyroid cartilage behind the hyoid bone. The lateral portion of the membrane is perforated by the superior laryngeal nerve and artery. Its deep sm-face is in contact with the hyo-epiglottidean Kgament. The Crico-thyroid Membrane or Ligament (Pig. 252, 13) is also cliiefly composed of elastic tissue, and passes between the borders of the cricoid and thyroid cartilages mesially for about a third of an inch, but laterally is prolonged backwards to the arytasnoid cartilages, and is continuous by the upper borders of these lateral partious with the true vocal cords. The Crico-tracheal Ligament is between the lower border of the cricoid cartilage and the upper ring of the trachea, and IS a simple membrane like that between the several rings of the trachea. Capsular Ligaments enclosing synovial membranes surround the articulations between the cricoid and the inferior cornua of the thyroid cartilage; and between the cricoid and the bases of the two arytcpjioid cartilages. The Thyro-epiglottidean Ligament connects the lower extremity of the epiglottis with the back of the thyi-oid cartila-e, a little below the notch in its upper border. ° The Hyo-epiglottidean Ligament is a fan-shaped band of yellow elastic tissue, passing behind the thja-o-hyoid membrane iroin the attached extremity of the epiglottis to the upper border of ■ the hyoid bone. Cartilages ov the Larynx. [The large cartilages of the larynx, viz., the thja-oid, cricoid two aiyt^noid, and the cartilage of the epiglottis, are readily recognized bu two pairs of minute cartilages, the cornicula laryngi.s and the cuneiform cartilages, are to be lookedfor in the arytamo-epigbtt de'n folds of mucous membrane.] •-l^oioraaean J)l ^^rf^ Cartilage (l.i'ig. 250, g) (e.pei. .?s„., like a shield) .s the largest cartilage of the larynx, and consists of twoTHE LARYNX, 522 halves ov aUii, which meet at an angle in front and form a promi- nence, especially distinct in the male adult, called the pomum Ailami. Each ala is quadrilateral in shape, and has a rounded posterior /wrr/«7-into which hbres of the stylo- and palato-pharyngei muscles are inserted; an inferior border, which gives attachment to the crico-thyroid muscle in its posteiior half, and to the crico- thja'oid membrane in its anterior half; and a superior border which forms the V-shaped notch of the pomum Adami, and gives attach- ment to the thyro-hyoid membrane and a few fibres of the stylo- pharyngei. Its posterior border is prolonged above and below into superior and inferior cornnn. The superior cornu, the longer of the two, runs upwards, backwards, and i:iwards, and gives attachment to the thyi'o-hyoid ligament, while the inferior cornu passes down- wards, forwards, and inwards, to articulate with the facet m the side of the cricoid cartilage, and gives attachment to the crico- thjToid and inferior constrictor muscles. On the outer surface of the ala is an ohhque ridfje, extendmg from a tubercle at the root of the superior coriui to another tubercle about the middle of the lower border of the cartilage. The ridge gives attachment to the sterno-thyroid and thp-o-hyoid muscles, and the surface behind it to the inferior constrictor of the pharynx. The inner surf (tees of the ate are smooth, and in the recedmg angle formed hj their iunction are attached nine structui-es, viz.. the thyro-epiglottidean ligament, the two pairs of thyi-o-arytienoid ligaments (false and true vocal cords), the two thyro-epiglottidei muscles, and the two thyi-o-arytasnoid muscles, the last just external to the inferior ligaments or true cords. The Cricoid Cartilage (Fig. 251, 19) {kpIkos eTSo,, Uke a rmg) is a ring of cartilage, shallow in front, where it is connected with the thyi-oid cartilage by a membrane, and has the crico-thyroideus attached to its outer surface ; but deep behind, where it fills up a part of the space left between the posterior borders of the thyroid cartilage. Its upper border looks obliquely forwards, while its lower border is h.nizontal. The nppn- border presents two oval articular sm-faces for the arytienoid cartilages, at the .sides of the deep portion, and more anteriorly gives origm to the crico- aryta^iioidei laterales. The lo,rev border is connected by a ligainen with the fii'st tracheal ring. 0, ,,,,b side, and near the lower border of the '^^^^ small facet for articulation with the inferior cornu of thyroid ...artilage. and below this is the attachment ..f the lowest hbie. 9 the inferior constrict..r.

The Arytaenoid Cartilages (Fig. 252, i6) (dpuroiVo, a pitcher*) are two in number, and are of a pyramidal shape. The base of each cartilage is triangular, and articulates near its outer angle with the upper border of the cricoid cartilage; above its anterior angle is a sharp projection, the 'processus rocalis, which gives attachment to the time vocal cord; and its external angle forms the prominent proci-ssiis muscularis, into which are inserted the crico-arytfenoideus posticus and crico-arytainoideus lateralis. The apex is curved backwards and inwards, and is surmounted by the cornicula laryngis. The posterior surface is smooth and concave, and gives attachment to the arytfenoideus muscle; the antero- external sm-face is rough for the origin of the thyro-arvtfBnoideus and arytajuo-epiglottideus muscles; and the internal sm-face, the narrowest, is smooth and is covered with mucous membrane. The Cornicula Laryngis or Cartilages of Santorini are two pau-s of small conical cartilag'es, connected with the apices of the arytrenoid cartilages and with the arytfeno-epiglottidean folds. The Cuneiform Cartilages or Cartilages of Wrisberg are two small rod-like bodies developed in the arytreno-epiglottidean folds of muc.jus membrane, but are sometimes wanting. These and the last are composed of yellow fibro-cartilage, while the thyroid, cricoid, and arytrenoid cartilages are of the hyaline variety. The Epiglottis (Fig. 252, 2), also composed of yeUow fibro- cartilage, is shaped like a cordate leaf, and has been seen to be connected by Ugaments with the thyroid cartilage and the hyoid bone. The upper thii-d of its anterior (buccal) surface and the whole of its postenor (laryngo-pharyngeal) surface are covered with mucous membrane. The cartilage is excavated, especially on Its posterior aspect, by numerous depressioii.s, in which mucous glands are lodged. The posterior sm-face is larger than the upper apertm'e of the larjnix, and may be divided into a lower or respiratory portion, covered with ciliated epithelium, and presenting m the middle line a Httle prominence, the cnshiw ; and an upper or gustatory portion, covered with squamous laminated -jpithelium and forming a part of the digestive tract.

The Jutenil hurdeni give attachment to the arj^tflsno-epiglottidean folds, the thyro- epiglottidei, arytEeuo-epiglottidei, and some fibres of the stylo- pharyngei muscles. Ligaments op the Cervical Vektebr^. The ligaments uniting the cervical vertebrte together are, except in the case of the first two, similar to those found in other parts of the spinal column, and their description will be found at the end of that of the thorax. The student would do well to refer to this description in order to observe the slight differences between these ligaments in the cervical and thoracic regions. Ligaments or the Atlas, Axis, and Occiput. [In order to examine the special ligaments of the first two cervical vertebra? and the occipital bone, it will be convenient to separate the whole of the cervical fi-om the thoracic spme.] The ligaments of the fii-st two vertebrce and the occipital bone may be conveniently divided into (1) those external to, and (2) those internal to, "the vertebral canal. The external ligaments more or less resemble the Ugaments common to the vertebral column, but the internal ligaments have special relation to the movements of nutation and rotation, which are peculiar to this region. -r. . • j 1. The External Urjaments are the Anterior, Posterior, and Lateral Occipito-Atlantal, and the Anterior and Posterior Atlanto- axial ligaments; besides Capsular ligaments for the articular processes of the vertebrae and the condyles of the occipital bone. The Anterior Occipito-Atlantal Ligament (Pig. 258) consists of a superficial and a deep portion. The superficial portion (i) is narrow and mesial, and is attached to the basilar process of the occipital bone above, and the anterior tubercle of the atlas below. The deep portion (2) is broad and membranous, and is attached to the occipital bone close to the foramen magnum above, and to the upper margin of the anterior arch of the atlas below. The Posterior Occipito-Atlantal Ligament (Fig. 2o4, 3) resembles the ligamenta subftava, but is composed of sxhite fibrous tissue. It is thin and membranous, and is attached above to the posterior margin of the foramen magnum, and below to the posteriorTHE ANTERIOR ATLA.NTO-AXIAL LIGAMENT, arch of tlie atlas. On each side, this ligament is perforated by the vertebral artery and suboccipital nerve, over which some of its fibres arch. The Lateral Occipito-Atlantal Ligaments (Pig. 254, 4) are short strong bands, passing between the roots of the transverse processes of the atlas and the jugalar processes of the occipital bone. They serve to strengthen the capsular ligaments imiting the Pig. 253. Fig. 254. condyles of the occipital bone with the corresponding articular facets on the upper surface of the atlas. The Anterior Atlanto-Axial Ligament (Fig. 253, 4) resembles the anterior occipito-atlantal hgament, and consists of a superficial and a deep portion. The superficial portion is round, and is con- tmuous with the anterior common ligament, being attached to the anterior tubercle of the atlas and the body of the axis.

The Posterior Atlanto-Axial Ligament (Fig. 254, 5) resembles the posterior occipito-atlantal ligament, and is composed of white fibrous tissues, Uned by a layer of yellow elastic tissue. It extends between the posterior arch of the atlas and the laminre of the axis, and is pierced by the second cervical nerve. The Capsular Atlanto-Axial ligament is sufficiently loose to Fig. 255.

It is attached below to the back of the body of the axis, and superiorly to the basilar groove of the occipital bone, above the anterior margin of the foramen magnum. [The occipito-axial ligament is to be divided and turned up and down, when the cruciform ligament of the atlas and axis will be brought into view, and immediately above the ti'ausverse portion will be seen the two oljlique odontoid ligaments.] The Cruciform Ligament (Fig. 256) consists of a strong trans- verse ligament and two small vertical sKps. The Transverse Liga- ment (2) is attached to a tubercle on the inner sm-face of each lateral mass, and thus foi-ms with the anterior arch of the atlas a ring in which the odontoid process of the axis is fimily held. The vertical slips of the cruciform ligament pass fi'om the transverse ligament to the basilar process of the occipital bone and the body of the axis respectively, and by detaching the upper one the odontoid ligaments will be fully seen. The Odontoid or Check Ligaments (Fig. 256, 5) are two strong bands of fibres, which pass from the sides of the head of the odontoid process to the margin of the foramen magniun on each side, and thus check the rotation of the cranium and atlas upon the odontoid process. Between these is a weak central odontoid liga- ment {ligammtam saspensoriiim), passing vertically between the margin of the foramen magnum and the top of the odontoid process. On cutting all the ligaments of the articulation except the trans- verse ligament of the atlas, the odontoid process will be found to be still firmly held in position, owing to the fact that the transverse hgament grasps the contracted neck of the odontoid process. There are two synovial membranes in connection with the odontoid process, one in fi'ont, between it and the posterior siu'face of the atlas ; the other behind, between it and the transverse ligament.M MARTERIES OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 531 TABLE XI.—THE ARTEBIES OP THE HEAD AND NECK.

[Tlie axilla having been completed, the dissectors of the thorax should detach the remains of the pectorales, the serrati, and the abdommal muscles fi-om the outer sm-faces of the ribs and theu- cartilages, and dissect the external intercostal muscles.] The External Intercostal Muscles (Pig. 116, 4), eleven in number on each side, are placed between the ribs, and are attached to the lower and upper borders and outer surfaces of the adjacent bones, the fibres running obliquelj^ downwards and forwards. They extend fi'om the tubercles of the ribs to the line of junction with the costal cartilages ; and beyond this point, prolonged to the anterior extremities of the intercostal spaces, is a tliiu fascia, the fibres of which take the same direction as those of the external intercostals. [By removing the external intercostal in one space, the outer suriace of the internal intercostal muscle will be exposed, and the mtercostal artery will be found with its accompanying vein and nerve The artery Kes at first at the lower border of "the rib bound- ing the space above, and ends by anastomo.sing with the corre- sponding intercostal branch of the internal mammary, which runs outwards m the substance of the internal intercostal muscle. A small collateral branch of the artery will be found at the lower part of each space between the muscles, anastomosing with a corresponding branch of the internal manunaiy.] 1 o The Internal Intercostal Muscles (Fig. IKJ, 5) take a direc- tion opposite to that of the external muscles, and can now bo seen only m front, where the external muscles are wanting, but wUl be lully exposed from within the thorax. Each muscle in the typical spaces extends from the ano-les of the nbs to the anterior extremity of the space. It is attached to the superior border of the lower rib, close to the attachment of tHe external intercostal, and to the inner margin of the vascular groove of the upper rib, encroaching ui.on the inner siu'faces ofTHE THOHAX. 538 both bones. It should be noted that both external and internal intercostals are attached to the outer border of the first rib. The intercostal muscles, both external and internal, are muscles of inspiration. [The knife is to be carried through the cartilages of all the true libs except the first, as near the bones as possible, and then along the intercostal space between the 5th and 6th ribs to the lower part of the sterniim. The sternum having been sawn across between the 1st and 2nd ribs, and between the 5th and 6th ribs, the inter- vening part is to be removed with the triangularis stenii and the internal mammary vessels, which are necessarily divided in two places, the plem-£e being cut near the median line so as to preserve the anterior mediastinum.] The Triangularis Sterni Muscle (Fig. 259, 3) lies at the back of the sternum, but when it has been damaged by the incision made for injecting the subject, another specimen should be examined on a fresh sterniun fi'om the post-mortem room. It arises from the inner surface of the ensiform cartilage and lower part of the meso-sternum, and from the cartilages of the last two or three ti-ue ribs ; and is inserted into the cartilages of the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th ribs. Its digitations, which appear to be continuous with those of the trausversalis, pass behind the internal mammary vessels. It acts as a muscle of expii-ation by depressing the ribs, and is supplied by the intercostal nerves. [The internal mammary arteries may now be dissected by remo vmg the triangularis sterni.] The Internal Mammary Artery (Fig. 259, 2) passes down- wards behind the cartUages of the ribs, about half an inch froin the margin of the sternum supei-ficiaUy to the triangularis sterni, as far as the 7th costal cartilage, where it divides into its terminal branches the superior epigastric aud the musculo-phrenic. a. The superior epigastric hranch, after passuig between the sternal and costal origins of the diaphragm, enters the fibres of the rectus abdominis muscle, and anastomoses with the deep epigastric brunch of the external iliac. b. The musculo-phrenic branch runs outwards between the lower rib cartilages and the diaphragm, and after perforating the latter opposite the 8th or 9th cartilage, supplies it, anastomosing with tho lower intercostal arteries, and with the phi-enic branches of the abdominal aorta. The other branches of the internal mammary are (c) comes m rrt phrevici, a small branch accomiianying the phi-emc nerve ; W mediastinal and (<•) pericardiac branches, from which small twigs539 THE PLEURyE. pass to form the " siib-pleural mediastinal plexus" (Turner); (/) sUrnul, to the sternum and triangularis sterni; (</) anterior inter- costcds, two to each of the upper six intercostal spaces, running outwards at first beneath the internal intercostal muscle, then between the two intercostals, and anastomosing with the posterior intercostal branches; and (A) perforating branches to the pectoral muscles and to the mamma and the skin. The vence comites of the internal mammary artery unite to open into the corresponding innominate vein. On opening the thorax as directed, the lungs wiU be exposed by the necessary division of the pleuras, and, unless attached by old adhesions, have probably fallen back so as to show the pleura pericardii and its pLicte adiposse. The great vessels of the heart will be seen emerging fi-om the upper part of the pericardium, and if the pericardium has been opened to allow of the injection of the body, a portion of the heart may be visible, but for the present the opening may be advantageously closed with a stitch. Suh-phural Cuniiedive Tissue (Fig. 257). Between the parietal pleiu-a and the chest-wall may be seen a well-marked layer of con- nective tissue, which is prolonged in a more attenuated form beneath the diaphragmatic and pericardiac plem-a, and into the neck over the pleural domes. It is continuous with the abundant media- stinal areolar tissue surrounding the vessels and nerves, and passes into the neck and axillae chiefly in the foi-m of vascular and nervous sheaths, and thi-ough the aortic opening to join the subperitoneal tissue; in certain positions it becomes the seat of abundant fatty deposits, as over the front of the pericardium, where it forms large adipose folds which extend on to the adjacent part of the dia- phragm. It is difficult to demonstrate beneath the visceral layer of the pleura, but is nevertheless present and invests the pulmonary lobules. Over the root of the lung it is found in considerable quantity, and there serves to bind the component elements together. The Pleurae (Fig. 259) are two shut sacs of serous membrane Immg the thorax and covei-ing the lungs, but have been opened in removing the sternum. One of the lungs is to be di-awn forward, when its pleura can be readily traced over the inner surface of the sternum and ribs (costal portion) to the back of the root of the lung, forming the lateral boundary of the posterior mediastinum (media- stmal portion); thence around the hmg (pulmonary portion) to the front of the root, from whicli it passes on to the pericardium (peri- cardial layer), and is caii-iod forward to about the middle; of the sterniun, where it becomes continuous with the costal portion. If the lung is drawn forward, below its root wiU be seen a fold of540 THE THORAX. pleura called the lii/amcidum latum pnJiaonin, connecting the lower lobe with the side of the pericardium and diaphragm. The pleura is reflected upon the upper surface of the diaiihragin below (dia- phragmatic laj'er), and prolonged in a conical form above the fii-st rib, where it may be felt behind the subclavian artery (cer- vical layer or dome). The visceral layer of the pleura is that which covers the lung ; the parietal layer includes the costal layer as well as that part which covers the diaphragm and the sides of the pericardium, and enters into the formation of the mediastina and dome. The right pleura is shorter but wider than the left, because the diaphragm rises higher on the right side owing to the presence of the liver, and the heart has a dii-ection to the left. The position of the anterior and inferior reflections of the pleurie should be carefully studied. The anterior reflection of the right pleura passes a little beyond the mid-line of the sternum, that of the left pleura extends to the mid-line down to the fourth costal cartilage, but from that point it diverges more or less towards the left. In about eleven subjects out of twelve it does not pass outside the left sternal border, and consequently leaves only a very narrow mediastinal space, while the whole of the pericardium opposed to the left costal cartilages and intercostal spaces is sepa- rated from these parietal structures by the pleura. The inferior reflection extends in a slightly ascending course from the neck of the 12th rib around the thorax to the sternal end of the 7th costal cartilage, crossing the 11th, 10th, 9th, and Sth ribs in succession. The Mediastinum is the space between the j^leura?. For con- venience of description it is divided into two parts, superior and inferior, the latter being subdivided into three segments, anterior, middle and posterior. The Superior Mediastinum is bounded in front by the manubrium sterni, the sterno-hyoid and sterno-thjToid muscles; behind by the bodies of the upper four thoracic vertebrre and the longus colli; above by the oblique plane of the upper aperture of the thorax; and below by a nearly horizontal plane dra^TO through the lower surface of the body of the fourth thoracic vertebra and the junction of the manubrium with the body of the sternum. It contains the trachea ; the oesophagus ; the thoracic duct; the arch of the aorta and its three great branches; the innominate veuis, with theu- tributaries ; part of tlio superior vena cava; the phrenic, pneumo- gastric, left recurrent laryngeal, and cardiac nerves ; lymphatic glands; the remains of the thymus; and a large quantity of connective tissue investing these structures.541 THE MEDIASTINUM. The Inferior portion of the. ijreat mediastimd space, by an unneces- sary and somewhat peiiilexing convention, is divided into three parts, anteiior, middle and posterior. The Anterior Mediastinum is boimded behind by the pericardium, (one of the contents of the "middle" mediastinum), and in front Fig. 257. 7 5 3 1 'ig. 257.—Oblique section of superior mediastinum below first rib and first thoracic vertebra (Anderson ajid Makins) from beneath.

The lungs are to be drawn away from the heart, and the layer of pleura reflected on the pericardium is then to be carefully removed (the phrenic nerves Ipng between the two serous membranes on each side being- preserved), and the roots of the lungs cleaned \vithout injuring the pericardium. After observing the external surface of the pericardium, it may be opened by an oblique incision from above downwards and to the left, in order to study its interior.] The Pericardium (Fig. 259) is a fibro-serous membrane en- closing the heai-t. The Fibrous layer is of conical shape, attached by its base to the thoracic surface of the diaphragm, while its narrow upper ex tremity becomes lost upon the adventitia of the gi-eat vessels. It receives a band of fibrous tissue fi-om the deep cervical fascia in front, and is connected to the sternum and spine by fascial Hgamentous processes. Its outer surface gives attachment in the greater part of its extent to the pleui-as, which leave a mesial posterior mediastinal space uncovered behind, and a vei-y nan-ow anterior mediastinal space to the left of the middle line in fi-ont. The latter usually lies behind the lower third of the left side of the meso-stemum. The Serous layer resembles other serous metabranes in having parietal and visceral reflections. The parietal lamina covers the inner surface of the fibrous layer, and the cardiac area of the dia- phragm; the visceral layer invests the heart and the roots of all the great vessels, extending as a common tube for the aorta and pulmo- nary artery for a distance of about two inches fi-om theii- origin. It also surrounds the pulmonary veins and superior vena cava, but covers the inferior vena cava only on its anterior half, the posterior half of the vessel blending with the fibrous pericai-dium just after piercing the diaphragm. It forms a number of pouches between the great vessels. Two of these are specially noteworthy, the oblique sinus, between the inferior left pulmonary vein and the inferior vena cava; and the transverse sinus, a complete tunnel between the conjoined arterial trunks (aorta and pulmonic) in front, and the venous trunks behind and below. The fibrous layer and the parietal portion of the serous pericar- dium are supplied by branches from the aorta, the intercostals, the phi-enics, and the internal mammary arteries. The visceral peri- cardium is supplied by twigs of the coronary arteries. The Phrenic Nerves (Fig. 259, 4, 5) may be followed in the whole of their course, if the dissection of the neck is sufficiently advanced, and should be carefully preserved. Each nerve arises from the 4th and 5th cervical nerves, and fi-equently by a small branch from the 3rd; it crosses the scalenus anticus in the neck, and i545 THE ROOTS Of THE LUNGS. reaches the front of the first stage of the subclavian artery, com- municating with a branch from the inferior cervical ganglion and sometimes with the nerve to the subclavius. Passing behind the subclavian vein and in front of the root of internal mammary artery, it enters the thorax. The left nerve then runs between the horizontal arch of the aorta and the left lung in front of the pueumo- gastric nerve, while the right nerve lies to the outer side of the right imiominate vein and the superior cava. Both nerves pass in front of the roots of the lungs, and between the pleura? and 23eri- cardium, give filaments to both membranes, and finally pierce and supply the diaphi-agm; the right also giving branches to the capsule of the liver, the left communicating with the solar plexus. The left nerve is longer than the right, partly because of the deflection of its coiu'se by the projection of the heart to the left, partly on accoimt of the lower level of the diaphragm on this side. Accom= panying each nerve may be seen a small comes nerviphrenici artery ftom the internal mammary. [The pericardium is to be dissected from the roots of the lungs and entirely removed from the great vessels, except a emaU piece which should be left to mark the point at wHch it was attached to the aorta. In domg this care must be taken of the left phi-enic and left imemno-gastric nerves, as weU as of some smaU cardiac nerves and the left superior mtercostal vein, aU of which cross the arch 01 the aorta.] The Roots of the Lungs (Figs. 259 and 260) are each formed by a pulmonary artery, two puhnonary veins, and a bronchus with smaU bronchial vessels, the anterior and posterior puhnonary plexuses of the pneumo-gastric and sjonpathetic nerves, and some lymphatics, all bound together by connective tissue continuous with the mediastinal and subpleural tissue, and invested by a fold of pleura. The order of the three principal structui-es from before backwards is the same on both sides of the body, viz., veins, artery and bronchus ; from above downwards on the right side the order 18 the reverse, viz., bronchus, artery, veins; but on the left side it is artery, bronchus, veins. The reason of this difference is, that a large eparterial branch is given off from the right bronchus to the upper obe of the lung, while the branch to the corresponcUng lobe "1 the left lung is hyparterial (.see p. oT-'i). J\ieriykt root is related in front to the superior vena cava and the phrenic nerve; hehind to the vena azygos major and the vao-us nerve; and the vena azygos major curves over it «io.eto teiWifp m the superior cava. The left root has m front the phi-enic norvo; hehind, the descendin<^546 THE THORAX, arcli of the aorta and vagus nerve; ahove, the horizontal arch of the aorta and the recurrent laryngeal neiTS, and helow the ligamentum latum pulmonis. The Lungs (Fig. 260) varj' very much in condition in different bodies. They are somewhat contracted, but if perfectly healthy Fig. 260. theu- surfaces are smooth, and the tissue is elastic and crepitant throughout. They are of a pinkish white colour, marbled and mottled, in the adult, with lines of bluish black pigment, which miay be greatly exaggerated in residents in large towns.

Each lung is divided into two priuci^Dal segraents bj' an oblique fissm-e, and the upper segment of the right is intersected bj^ a second fissure. These fissures extend down to the roots and subdivide the lungs into lobes, superior and inferior on the left side, and superior, middle and inferior on the right. The superior lobe of the right lung receives a large eparterial bronchial tube, which passes above the right pulmonary artery; all the other tubes of both lungs being hyparterial. The pulmonic plem-a is intimately adherent to the lung tissue, and is prolonged into the fissm-es. Each lung may be described as having a base, an apex, an ex- ternal or parietal siu-face, an internal or mediastinal sm-face, and anterior, posterior and inferior margins. The base is concave, with sharp margins, and rests upon the dia- phragm. The apex is rounded and projects only to a small extent above the oblique plane of the upper opening of the thorax, but it reaches about an inch and a half above the horizontal level of the fii'st costal cartilage, and Hes behind the subclavian vessels. The outer surface, moulded to the inner surface of the thoracic wall, is strongly convex and marked by oblique ridges corresponding to the intercostal spaces, and by a long oblique fissm-e running from a httle below the apex at the back to the lower part of the anterior border in the front. In the right lung the portion of the organ above this fissure is subdivided by a second deep fissui-e, passing almost horizontally forwards from the middle of the oblique fissm-e to the anterior margin. The inner surface may be divided into three portions, corresponding to the superior, middle and posterior mediastina, the middle mediastinal portion presenting an ii-re"-ular aperture, the hihim, for the passage of the structui-es of the root. In a lung which has been hardened in situ, each segment bears distinct impressions of the principal structiu-es contained within the con-esponding part of the interpleui-al space. This moulding is indicated in Pigs. 261 and 262, and conveys a valuable idea of the relations of the siu-face under consideration. The anterior margin of each lung is sharp and ovoriaps the heart and great vessels, reaching the mid-line of the sternum opposite the third costal cartilage, and meeting the opposite lung. That of the right lung then passes vertically downwards as low as the junction of the gladiolus with the ensiform cartilage- whUst that of the left lung passes outwards to the loft in a curved NN 2THE THORAX. 548 Fig. 261. 11 - Fig. 261.-The inner aspect of the right lung showing its relations to the ^ mediastinal structures.

There is hence an interspace between the two antei-ior borders, in which the pericardium is separated from the parietes only by the inner portion of the left pleura and the subpleui'al and mediastinal connective tissue. This space coincides with the area n/'cardiuc duJncsa of physicians. It will be seen that it is much larger than the "anterior mediastinum" (Fig. 259), and is very different in outline. It should be remembered also that while the mediastinal area is constant in its dimensions, the inteiiiulmonic area varies during life with the amount of au' in the lungs, and for obvious reasons may be greatly widened when exposed in the dead subject. The inferior nmrgin is sharply defined and follows the hue of reflection of the pleura, but never reaches quite so low, even after the deepest inspiration. The left lung is somewhat longer vertically than the right, owing to the lower level of the diaphi'agm on the left side ; it is, however, of smaller bulk in consequence of the encroachment of the ventricu- lar portion of the heart upon that side of the thoracic cavity. The Heart (Fig. 263) is placed obliquely between the lungs, and rests on the diaphragm, with its base dii-ected backwai-ds and to the right, and the apex to the left side. The base Ues opposite to the 6th 7th and 8th thoracic vertebrtB, and the apex beats between the oth'and'eth ribs, about 3 inches fi'om the middle line, below and to the inner side of the nipple. A median sagittal secfum of the body (Fig. 270) leaves, on the right side, a portion of both auiicles. with all the venous orifices except those of the left pulmonary veins, and a small portion of the anterior part of the right ventricle On the left are the whole of the left ventricle, nearly the whole of the right ventricle, the pulmonic and aortic orifices (the latter sometimes in the median line, rarely to the right), portions of both auricles, and the openings of the left pulmonary veins The right hordn- of the heart is situated an inch and a halt ii-om the middle line; the upr.r, which is about two inches below the nia e nipple and one to its sternal sicft, lies three inches from the middle of the sternum ; the hase is opposite the 6th, 7th, and 8th thoracic vertebrae; and the hwer border is marked by a Ime drawn from the 6th right chondro-sterual articulation to the apex of the heart. The positions of the central points of the arterial and <,«r<a</o- ventri,^lar orifices, according to Braune, are as M ows, but the e are, of course, subject to considerable variation The Ostnunjtd- rnonale lies behind the upper border of the thu-d left costal cartilage.THE HEART. a fifth of an inch from the sternal border; the Ostium aorticum, behind the middle of the left half of the sternum opposite the third costal cartilage; the Ostium hicuspidale, in the thu'd left intercostal space, two-fifths of an inch to the left of the sternum; Pig. 263. and the Ostium tricuspidale, a little to the right of the mid-line of the sternum, opposite the fourth intercostal space. The surface of the heart, with its pericardial investment, is related (1) to the thoracic wall, in the triangular space already described as the anterior mediastinum ; (2) to the inner surface of the pleura and lungs (see Pigs. 261 and 262); (3) to the posterior Fig. 263.=Diagram of the relations of the thoracic viscera to the walls of the chest, 1.

The anterior mediastinal area lies on the left side of the median line, and comprises only a small portion of the anterior aspect of the right ventricle. The rujht j^ulmonro area consists of a small part of the right ventricle, the right auricle with its appendage, and hehind these the right side of the left auricle. The left pulmonic area includes a portion of the left border of the right ventricle, the superior external aspect of the left ventricle, the left side of the left auricle, with its appendage, the anterior inter-ventrioular furrow, and part of the auriculo-ventricular fui'row. The diaphragmatic area consists of portions of the right and left ventricles, with the posterior inter-ventricular septum; and a portion of the right auricle, with the inferior caval orifice. The posterior mediastinal area consists of the posterior part of the base of the heart, with the pulmonic veins. The weight of the healthy heart averages 11 oz. in the male and 9 oz. in the female. The anterior aspect of the heart is convex, and is foiTued almost entirely by the right ventricle and auricular appendage; but a small portion of the right auricle is seen at the right side, and a part of the left ventricle at the apex and the left border, while the iiTegular border of the left auricular appendage appears to the left of the pulmonary artery. The postero-inferior sm-face of the heart, which rests for the most jDart upon the diaphi-agm, is flattened, and is formed by part of the right aui'icle, and by the left auricle and ventricle, which last forms the apex of the heart. Each sui-face of the heart is grooved, by the divisions between the aui-icles and ventricles. The atiterior inter-ventricular groove is near the left border of the heart, whilst the piosierior inter-ventricular groove lies a little to the right, their positions indicating the oblique direction of the septum. In these grooves will be seen the descending branches of the coronary vessels. The Corollary Arteries (right and left) are the first branches of the aorta, and supply the substance of the heart. They are to bo found on either side of the pulmonary artery, with a plexus {coronary) of nerves accompanying each. The left coronary artery arises fi'om the left posterior sinus of Valsalva, and passes behind the pulmonary artery and to its left side, there breaking up into two branches, (1) nuriciilo-ventriciilar. which runs in the auriculo-ventricular groove on the posterior aspect of the heart to anastomose with the corresponding branch of553 GREAT VESSELS OF THE HEART. the right coronary artery; and (2) anterior intcr-ventricular, which runs in the anterior inter-ventriculai" groove to the apex of the heart. The artery supplies branches to both ventricles, the left aiu'icle, the pulmonary artery, the aorta, and the septum. The right coronary artery springs fi'om the anterior sinus of Valsalva, coixrses from left to right in the am-iculo-ventricular groove, and opposite the posterior inter-ventricular fui-row divides into aiiriculo-veniricidar and posterior inter-ventricular branches, the latter running in the groove to the apex to anastomose with the anterior inter-ventricular of the left artery. It supplies branches to both venti'icles, the right auricle, the aorta, and the pulmonary artery. The Veins of the heart do not correspond precisely to the arteries. The yreat cardiac vein runs up the anterior inter-ventricular groove with the descending branch of the left coronary artery, but leaves it to pass along the horizontal amiculo-ventricular groove to the back of the heart, where it becomes considerably enlarged, and terminates by foi-ming the coronary sinus, between the left auricle and ventricle. It receives the posterior cardiac veins from the back of the heart, the middle cardiac vein which foUows the inter- ventricular groove behind, the right coronary vein which enters it near the tei-mination, and small branches from the aiu'icles, including the oblique vein of Marshall, which runs downwards and inwards over the back of the left auricle, and probably represents the remains of the fcetal left superior vena cava. Pinally it opens by means of the coronary sinus into the back of the right am-icle. Some small anterior cardiac veins, and other small veins called the vente minimce cordis, pass directly into the right auricle. The superficial cardiac jilexus of the sympathetic is situated between the arch of the aorta and the bif lu-cation of the pulmonary artery, and gives branches to the fi-ont and back of the heart. To it may be traced the left superior cardiac nerve of the sympathetic, the inferior cervical cardiac of the left vagus, the cardiac branch from the recuixent laryngeal, and branches from the deep cardiac plexus. The deep cardiac plexus lies behind the aorta, and is formed by all the cardiac nerves of the right side, and the middle and mferior cardiac of the left sjTnpathetic and the superior cardiac of the left vagus. The Great Vessels of the Heart (Pig. 269) have the following positions. The vena cava superior lies to the right, the pulmonary artery to the left, and between them is the arch of the aorta. The inferior vena cava can bo seen piercing the diaphragm at the back of554 THE THORAX. the heart, by drawing the organ ui^wards; and the right and left pulmonary veins pass outwards from the back of the left auricle to join the roots of the lungs. The Cavities of the heart are to be opened in situ, and in the order in which the blood enters them. [The right auricle is to be opened by one incision from the superior to the inferior vena cava, and another at right angles to it into the auricular appendage.] Right Auricle (Fig. 264, i).—The interior of the auricle consists of a main cavity, the atrium or sinus venosus, and the diverticulum of the auricular appendage. It is smooth internally, except on its anterior wall and in the appendix, where the muscular fibres form prominent bands, for the most part running parallel to each other like the teeth of a comb, and hence called musculi pedinati. The endocardium, or lining membrane, is seen to be continuous with the lining membrane of the veins. The large openings into the right auricle are those of the superior vena cava (3), entering at the upper and anterior part; the inferior vena cava (4), entering at the lower and back part; and the coronary sinus (7), lying between the inferior caved and the auricuJo-ventri- cular (9) openings and below the Eustachian valve. The foramina Thehesii are numerous small openings which are foimd in the wall of the auricle, corresponding to the anterior cardiac veins and the vena3 cordis minimse. Similar but still smaller apertui-es may be found in the other cavities. The tubercle of Loiuer is a projection occasionally found in the wall of the aiuicle, between the superior and inferior venae oavoB. It depends upon a subserous deposit of fat. The coronary valve (8) (valve of Thebesias) is a thin imperfect endocardial fold at the orifice of the coronary sinus. The Eustachian valve (6) is a semilunar fold placed in fi-ont and to the left of the opening of the vena cava inferior, extending between this orifice and the lower border of the anniilxxs ovalis unmediately above the opening of the coronary sinus. In the fcetus it du-ects the cuiTcnt of blood from the inferior vena cava thi-ough the foramen ovale, but in the adult is generally oribriform and very imperfect. The fissa ovalis and nnnulus ovalis (5) are also remains of fcetal structui'es, found on the inner wall of the right auricle. The annulus oralis is a muscular ring suiTOunding the shallow fossa ovalis, and representing the margin of the foramen ovale of the fcetus.

This membrane rises from the posterior margin, of the foramen about the foiu-th month of foetal Ufe, and, as it develops, giaduaUy overlaps the anterior margin of the opening, so as to form a complete valve which allows the passage of the blood from right to left, but intercepts it in the opposite direction.

[To open the right ventricle, its flaccid wall should be grasped with the left hand, and the scalpel made to transfix it about half- way down, and well to the right side of the septum; the knife being then carried towards the apex, the cavity of the ventricle will be opened. The left forefinger is to be passed up into the pulmonarj' artery, and will serve to guide the incision, which is to be prolonged into that vessel, if possible, betmeen two of the semilimar valves. All clots being removed, the whole of the ventricle will be displayed.] The Biglit Ventricle (Fig. 264, «) consists of a main cavity, the walls of which show columnar projections formed by the muscular substance of the heart; and of a smooth funnel-shaped portion (ij)finuUbidum or conus arteriosus) leading upwards and to the left into the pulmonary artery. The projections on the wall of the ventricle are called columnce carnece (Ji) ; of these four varieties may be described; one in which the column merely stands out in relief, being attached to the waU of the ventricle in its whole length; a second in which the column is attached at both ends but is fi-ee in the middle, so that a probe may be passed between it and the wall, trahecuhe carnece; a thii-d, called muscnU papilJures ((/), which project into the cavity of the ventricle and give attachment by their extremities to chordce tvndinece, or fibrous cords passiug to the flaps of the auriculo-ventricular valve ; and a fourth variety consisting of bands which pass from one fleshy column to another, or to the ventricular wall. One of these latter, running fi-om the base of the anterior papillary muscle to the septum, is called the moderator bund, a structure which is largely developed in the ox and some other of the lower animals. The right auriculo-ventricular or tricnsi^id valve (e) is formed by a reduplication of the endocardium or lining membrane of the heart, and between its layers are some tendinous and muscxdar fibres, the former being continuous with the chordae tendineso. The entii-e valve is attached above to a fibrous ring {zona tendinosa), which bounds the aiu-iculo-ventiicular opening, and is divided below into three hmjer ntsps, light, left, and posterior, and three smaller cusps alternating with these, all giving attachment by their free borders and ventricular surfaces to chordae tendineae. The chorda; tendinece are connected to three groups of musculi pajnllares, anterior, posterior, and internal or septal—the last group, however, are very imperfectly developed, and some of the cords of the posterior cusp may be attached directly to the septal wall. Each557 CAVITIES OF THE HEART. group of chorclEe tendineas will be found attached to the adjacent borders of two larger cusps and to the small intervening cus]^, and each large cusp hence receives its chordte tendinefie from two sets of musculi papillares. The left cusp of the valve is the largest and is in contact with the anterior wall, the right cusp lies against the right wall, and the posterior is ojiposed to the back jDart of the septvun ventriculoriim. The left or infundiiular flap shuts oil the infundibulum from the general cavity of the ventricle, but does not form a part of the iafimdibulum. The aui-icular sui-face of the tricuspid valve is extremely- smooth, for the purpose of facilitatiug the flow of blood into the ventricles. The tricuspid valve acts dui-ing contraction of the ventricle (systole), and prevents the regm-gitation of blood into the auricle; but even in health there is said to be a slight reflux, which has been termed the ' safety-valve action.' The infundibular division of the tricuspid valve serves to prevent the blood from flowing into the pulmonary artery until the ventricle is fully distended, and able to contract forcibly on its contents. IThe pulmonary artery is attached to a fibrous ring, which inter- venes between it and the muscular substance of the heart, and the lining membrane of the artery is continuous with that of the ventricle. The semilunar valves (m) of the pulmonary artery are thi'ee re- duplications of the hning membrane, sti-engthened by fibrous tissue which is collected principally at the attached border of each valve. The attached border is semicii-cular, and is fixed to the wall of the artery; the free border is subdivided into two sHghtly concave portions by a little fibro-cartilaginous body, called the corjnis Araniii. On each side of the corpus Arantiiis a crescentic portion, the Imiula, which is more transparent than the rest of the valve owiiig to the absence of the fibrous elenients. Two of the valves are anterior (right and left) and one posterior, and the arterial wall is dilated opposite each valve to fonn the ainus of Valsalva. The semilunar valves act during dilatation of the ventricle (diastole), and prevent the regurgitation of the blood from the pulmonar}^ artery. The blood, which is venous or dark-coloured, is carried by the pulmonary artery to its bifmration, and then by the right and loft pidmonary arteries to the lungs, whore it is aerated; and is brought back to the heart by the four pulmonary veins as arterial or red blood. The pulmonary veins open into the left auricle.558 THE THORAX. [The left auricle is to be opened by one vertical incision on its posteiior aspect, midway between the pulmonaiy veins, and another into the auricular appendage. The heart must be drawn well upwards and to the right side to expose the cavity properly.] The Left Auricle (Fig. 265, i) resembles the right auiicle, but the sinus venosus is free fi'om musculi pectinati, and the auiicular appendix is longer and thinner and more " crenate." The openings into it are those of the pulmonary veins, two on each side, and the left auiiculo-ventricular orifice, which is smaUer than that on the right side. The musvuh- pecUndti of the auricular appendix are like those ot the right side but smaUer. On the septiun of the auncle may be indistinctly visible the annulus ovalis and fossa ovalis, and the free edge of the valve of the foramen ovale may be seen as a Uttle semilunar fiu-row outside the upper and anterior portion of the annulus. It is here that a persistent communication may sometunes be found between the two amides.

The coluvimv carneoi and chorda: tmdiuav bear a resemblance to those of the right side. . The endocardium of the left cavities of the heart is thicker and more opaque than that of the right cavities. • • •, ^ The left aui-iculo-ventricular, mitral, or &ic»si>»rf valve, is similar in construction and connections to that of the right side, but pre- sents only two principal cusps with two small mtoi-mediatc cusp..

The muscidi papiUares are iu two groups, and are much larger than those of the right ventricle, and the rest of the carnese colunuiEe are more numerous and more comjolex in theii' arrangement than on the right side. The auriculo-venti-icular ring is about five-sixths of the dimensions of that of the tricuspid opening (Fig. 267). The mitral valve acts during conti-action of the ventricle (systole), and prevents the regurgitation of blood into the auricle. Fig. 265.

The shortenmg of the musculi papillares during the contraction of the ventricle compensates for the approximation of the ven- tricular attachments to the auriculo-ventricular ring, and prevents the valve-flaps fi-om being driven into the auricle by the upward pressure of the blood-stream during the ventricular systole. A fibrous ring intervenes between the muscular tissue of the heart and the aorta, and the lining membrane of the vessel is here Fig. 266. continuous with the endocardium. This arterial rmg is about a tenth part smaUer than that of the pulmonic artery. The Aortic scmihmar valves resemble those of the pulmonaiy artery but are more fully developed, and the corpora Arantu axe better seen than on the right side.

The Foetal Circula- tion (Fig. 26S).-This wiU be the best oppor- tunity for contrasting the adult circulation with that of the fcetus. In the foetus the blood is brought fi'om the placenta by the innhi- h'cal vein, which, en- tering the body at the lunbilicus, passes up- wards to the longitu- dinal fissure of the Hver, and at the ti-ans- verse fissui'e divides into thi-ee branches, two jouiing the poi-tal vein, the other, called the diicfus i-e>wsiis, joining the inferior vena cava.

In the inferior vena cava the blood is joined by that returned from the lower exti'emities, and is then poured into the right auricle. The Eustachian valve, of large size in the foetus, directs the current across the amicle to the patent foramen ovale, and the blood enters the left aiu-icle, where it meets with a smaU admixtm-e of impm-e blood fi-om the lungs. From the left auricle the blood necessarily passes mto the left venti'icle, and is thence propelled through the aorta to the head and upper extremities, touchmg but probably not mtermuigluig with the superior caval stream entering the aorta by the ductus arteriosus. Prom these parts it is returned by the superior vena cava, which enters the upper part of the rio'ht auricle and the blood is joined by the cardiac blood from the corona.ry sinus and descends at once into the right ventricle, thus taking a course at right angles to, and in fi-out of, the inferior caval stream probably without admixture %vith it. Prom the right ventricle the blood is propeUed into the pulmonary artery, and a small portion reaches the lungs through the right and left pulmonary arteries to retm-n to the left ventricle, but by far the larger portion passes thi-ough the ductus arteriosus (a short tube connected with the pulmonary artery close to the bifiu-cation), and enters the arch of the aorta immediately beyond the origin of the left subclavian artery. Thi-ough the aorta passes the blood supplying the trunk and viscera; and then entering the ibac arteries, a smaU portion only IS conveyed by the external iliacs to the lower extremities but the greater part enters the internal iliacs to reach the hypoqastric arteries, two vessels which run to the umbilicus and then wind round the umbihcal vein to the placenta, under the name of umbilical arteries. It wiU be seen that the foetal circulation comprises two main streams, which keep almost wholly distinct from each other excent at one ponit: the well^xygenated placental stream supplyinc, the heart, head, neck and upper extremities; and the relatively innnu'e 8uj.'rn,r caval stream which, in part, goes to supply the luuo-s abdoimnal viscera, and lower extremities, and returns to contami- nate the placental stream in the inferior vena cava- and in part passes to the placenta for restoration of its vitalising elements, ihe hvor IS oi very large proportionate size in the fcBtus .uid appears to serve the double pm-pose of depui'ation and stora'^e of nutn(!nt material. ^ The Pulmonary Artery (Pig. 269, 28) is about two inches 00 2THE THORAX. 564 Fig. 2G9.-Heart and large vessels (fron, Bonaniy and Be.xu). 1.

The position of each of the arteries in the root of the lung has been already seen, the right being below, and the left above, the bronchi passing to the upjoer lobes of thi' corresponding lungs. Connecting the left jiulmonary artery with the descending portion of the arch of the aorta, immediately beyond the origin of the sub- clavian artery, is a fibrous cord, the Jujamentuin urteriosum, which is the relic of the obliterated ductus arteriosus of the foetus. External to this winds the left recurrent laryngeal nerve. The Pulmonary Veins are fom- in number, two to each limg. Their positions in the roots of the limgs have been seen, and they have been traced to the left auricle of the heart. The right veins are the longer and pass beneath the arch of the aorta, the left veins crossing the descending aorta. Occasionally the two veins of either side unite to form a single trunk before opening into the auricle. The Arcli of the Aorta (Fig. 269, 26).—The aorta arises from the left ventricle, and at first takes a coiu'se upwards and to the right side, then backwards and slightly to the left, over the root of the left lung and around the left side of the trachea. For con- venience of description the arch is divided into three poi-tions-- ascending, horizontal, and descending. The ascending or ventral aorta arises usually behind the left half of the sternum at the level of the* third costal cartilage, passes upwards, forwards, and somewhat to the right, a portion of its breadth crossing the middle line ; finally, curving again to tire left, it becomes continuous with the horizontal portion at the level of the upper border of the second costal cartilage. Tliis is perhaps the typical arrangement, but the examination of different subjects will show many variations, the most common of which is the encroach- ment of the origin of the aorta upon the middle line, the mesial sagittal plane cutting the left or even the anterior sinus of Valsalva. The portion of the vessel which projects towards the right, sometimes caWedthe (jreatsinus 0/the aorta, almost invariably lies in the right half of the body (Fig. 270, 7). The ascending aorta, with the pulmonary artery, is almost entirely enclosed in the serous pericardium. It is related in front to the root of the pulmonary artery, the right aimcular appendage, the edges of both pleurae and lungs, the lower portion of the thymus, and more superficially tlie left half of the sternum; behind to the left am-iclo, the right deep cardiac nerves, and the root of the right lung; on the left to the trunk of the pulmonaiy artery andTHE VENA CAVA SUPERIOR. 567 branches of the siipei-ficial cardiac nerves; and on the rifiht to the superior vena cava and right amicle. Its branches are the two coronary arteries, which have already- been ti'aced(p. 552). The horizontal aorta (transverse aorta, transverse portion of the arch of the aorta) commences behind the left half of the sternum, occasionally in the middle line, and thence runs backwards, inclin- ing slightly to the left to terminate on the left side of the inter- vertebral disc between the 4th and oth thoracic vertebrje. It describes a doable curve in its course, with one concavity down- wards corresj^onding to the root of the left lung, and another to the light corresponding to the trachea. It wiU be seen that the coiu-se of this portion of the great arterial trunk from the front to the back of the thorax is almost directly antero-posterior, hence its principal relations, usually described aa anterior and posterior, are rather left and right. On the left side are the left lung and pleiu-a, the left vagus and phi-enic nerves, and the origin of the left recm-rent laryngeal nerve. On the rhjht side, the right lung and pleura, the trachea, the oeso- phagus, the thoracic duct, the left recurrent laryngeal nerve, the deep cardiac plexus, and the left side of the disc between the 4th and 5th thoracic vertebrte. Ahove are its thi-ee gi'eat branches, innominate, left carotid and left subclavian, arising in the order named from before backwards and from right to left. Beloiu are the left bronchus, the bifurcation of the pulmonary artery, the ductus arteriosus, the recurrent laryngeal nerve, the superficial cardiac plexus, and some lymphatic glands. The hranches have been named : in the majority of cases, all lie to the left of the median line at theii- origin, the innominate crossing to the right side a little above its commencement; but in some cases the root of the latter vessel is cut by the mesial sagittal plane. The name desceiidiiiy 2)ortion of arch of aorta has been given to the part of the vessel that lies by the left side of the 5th thoracic vertebra (in the older text-books it was said to rest against the 4th or even the 3rd vertebra). On the left side and behind it is invested by the left pleiuu; in front are the vagus nerve and the root of the left lung; and on the right side it is related to the vertebral column, the oesophagus, and the thoracic dnct. The Vena Cava Superior (Fig. 260, lo) is formed by the junction of the right and left brachio-cephalic or innominate veins, on the right of the innominate artery. It receives the vena azygos major just above the root of the right liuig, and then, piercing the pericardiiun, enters the upper part of the right auricle.THE THORAX. 568 Great Vessels of the Eoot of the Neck. The tkree great branches of the second part of the arch of the , | aorta are the Innominate, the Left Carotid, and the Left Subclavian arteries. The Innominate Artery (Fig. 269, 23) begins usually on the left of the middle line of the body, but sometimes centrally, behind the manubrimn sterni and opposite the 4th thoracic vertebra. It jjasses obliquely ujDwards and to the right, dividing into the right common carotid and right subclavian ai-teries behind the upper border of the right sterno-clavicular joint, and opposite the interval between the two heads of the sterno-mastoid. It is about an inch and a half in length, and lies in the greater part of its extent sxrr- rouaided by the connective tissue of the superior mediastinum. In front of it are the maniibrium, the right sfcerno-clavicular joint, the remains of the thjTiius gland, and the origins of the sterno-hyoid and sterno-thja-oid muscles ; and it is crossed nearly at right angles bj^ the left innominate vein and obliquely by the right inferior thyi'oid vein. Behind it, near its origin, are the ti-achea and the root of the left common carotid artery, afterwards the prolongation of the right pleura into the neck. To the rujht side are the right plem-a and lung, the right innominate vein and right phrenic nerve; to the left side, the inferior thja-oid veins and, at its bifm-ca- tion, the trachea. The origin of the left common carotid lies somewhat to the left as well as behind. The innominate artery ordinarily gives off no branch, but occa- sionally a small vessel, the thyrouha ima, arises fi-om it or fi'om the aorta close to it, and rims up the fi'ont of the trachea to the thyi-oid body. The Left Common Carotid Artery (Fig. 269, 16) leaves the arch on the left of the middle Une, and runs upwards and to the left side, at a level anterior to that of the left subclavian artery. Above the left sterno-clavicvdar articulation its relations coiTespond to those of the right carotid artery (p. 408). Thetlioradc, portion has in front the manubriimi, with the remains of the thymus gland, the origins of the left sterno-hyoid and sterno- thyroid muscles, the root of the innominate artery and the com- mencement of the left innominate vein. Behind it He the root of the subclavian artery, the trachea, and at a higher point the left border of the oesophagus and the thoracic duct; to its right arc the innominate artery, the inferior thyi'oid vein, the trachea and the left recurrent laryngeal nerve; to its Jcft side, the left pneumo- gastric nerve with its cardiac branches, and the left plem-a and lung.569 GREAT VESSELS OF ROOT OF NECK. The Left Subclavian Artery (Fig. 269, 20), arising near the end of the horizontal aorta, behind and somewhat to the left of the left common carotid, extends to the outer border of the first rib, and may be conveniently divided into a thoracic and a cervical portion. The Thoracic portion is nearly vertical in its dii-ection, and Lies in a plane posterior to that of the left carotid artery and slightly to the left. It is crossed in front by the left innominate vein and cardiac nerves; to the inner side and behind are the trachea, the oesophagus, the left recui-rent laryngeal nerve, the thoracic duct, and the spine with the longus colli muscle ; on the outer side it is related to the left vagus and the left pleura and lung. The Cervical portion has been described (p. 414). Irregnlaritics of the Great Vessels.—The number and position of the branches of the arch of the aorta are subject to variation. The commonest ii-regularity is for the left carotid to arise from the inno- minate, thus reducing the branches to two; but there may be four large branches, owing to the right carotid and subclavian arising separately, or in rare cases to the right subclavian arising from the exti-eme left of the arch, and passing to the right side in front of or behind the oesophagus. The left vertebral artery not in- frequently arises from, the aorta between the left carotid and left subclavian; and the thyroidea ima may occasionally spring from the arch. The Right Innominate Vein (Fig. 260, 11) conuneuces at the inner end of the clavicle by the junction of the subclavian and internal jugular veins, and then descends on the outer side of the innominate artery to join the vein of the opposite side, the union of the two forming the vena cava superior opposite the lower border of the first costal cartilage or first intercostal space. It is closely mvested by the right pleui-a, and has the phi-enic nerve on its outer side and the vagus behind. The Left Innominate Vein (Fig. 260, 14), longer and more nearly hoiizontal than the right vein, commencing at a correspojiding point on the left side and in the same way, in front of the left common carotid artery, and runs obliquely downwards and to the right, lying above the level of the arch of the aorta. It crosses the mesial plane in front of the three great branches of the aorta, to unite with the right innominate vein behind the right half of the sternum, and the innermost part of the first intercostal space.

[The ascendino; portion of the arch of the aorta and the two vente cavfe are to be divided, and the remains of the heart removed with the pulmonary vessels, which are to be cut close to the lungs. The arch of the aorta is to be held to one side by hooks, and the bifurcation of the ti-achea with the deep cardiac plexus dissected oiit.] The Deep Cardiac Plexus (Fig. 271) is situated behind and to the left of the horizontal aorta, and in front of the trachea close to its bifm-cation. The rnjM half of the plexus receives all the cardiac nerves of that side, viz., three cardiac nerves from the tkree cervical ganglia of the sj-nipathetic, the cardiac branches of the pneumo- gastric, and the cardiac branch of its recurrent laryngeal nerve. The branches of this half of the plexus are distributed to the right side of the heart and the right lung, and many of them have been necessarily destroyed. The left half (Pig. 272) of the plexus receives all the cardiac nerves of the left side, with the exception of the superior cardiac branch of the sympathetic and the inferior cardiac branch of the pneumo-gastric, which have been already traced to the superficial cardiac plexus {p. 553). Its branches are distributed to the left side of the heart and the left lung, and communicate with the superficial cardial plexus. The Trachea (Fig. 269, i8) in the thorax has -in front of it the sternum, the remains of the thymus gland, the inferior thyroid vems, the deep cardiac nerves, the anterior i)ortion of the horizontal aorta, the lower part of the innominate and left common carotid arteries, and the left innominate vein. BeJnnd it lies the ODsophao-us. On the riijht side are the right plem-a and Imig, the right vagus, and a Ij^phatic gland. On the left, the tracheal cm-ve ofVe 7. Sterno-mastoid (out). B.

It bifiu'cates into the right and left bronchi ojoposite the upper border of the i5th thoracic vertebra, the septal portion of its last cartilage lying slightly to the left of the median line, so that the right bronchus is more likely to admit a foreign body than the left. The angle of bifm-cation is about 100°—110°. It is difficult to say whether the right bronchus is more horizontal or more vertical in its dii'ection than the left, on account of the asymmetry caused by the origin of the large eparterial branch fi-om the former tube; hence, perhaps, the discrepancy in the statements of different authorities. The Right Bron,ch.us (Fig. 271) is larger than the left. At a distance of about one inch fi'om its origin is given off a'large eparterial branch to the upper lobe of the lung. The right pulmonary artery passes backwards beneath this branch to reach the posterior surface of the lower part of the main bronchus (Fig. 279). The vena azygos major hooks over the right bronchus to open into the superior vena cava. The Left Bronclius (Fig. 272) rans beneath the arch of the aorta, crossing the oesophagus and the descending aorta. Its un- divided portion is nearly twice as long as that of the right bronchus, because the branch to the ujjper lobe of the lung comes off at a lower level than the eparterial branch on the right side. The pulmonary artery jDasses above it before breaking up into its branches. (See also p. 545.) 4. Glosso-pharyngeal nerve. 5. Lingual nei-ve (5tli). 6. Spinal-accessoiy nerve. 7.

[The right lung is to be drawn forward, and the pleura divided where it is reflected from the lung to the wall of the thorax, and the parts iu the posterior mediastinum are to be cleaned. The muscular oesophagus will be at once seen, and the right pneumo-gastric nerve is to be traced to it and to the back of the right bronchus. On disi^lacing the oesoijhagus, the side of the descending thoracic aorta will come into view, but it will be Ijetter seen in the dissection of the left side. The vena azygos major appears to the right of the aorta, and between the two will be found the slender and collapsed thoracic duct. The intercostal vessels will be seen crossing the back of the space, and near the diaphragm the splanchnic nerves from the sympathetic chain enter the mediastiniun, but the chain of ganglia lies behind the pleura.] The Posterior Mediastinum (Fig. 259) is the intei-plem-al space behind the pericardium. It is bomided behind by the thoracic vertebras below the 4th, in front by the pericardium, and on ecah sidr by the reflection of the pleura. Its contents are the thoracic aorta, the vena azygos major, the pneumo-gastric and splanchnic nerves, the a?sophagus, the thoracic duct, lymphatics and connective tissue. It communicates above with the neck through the superior mediasti- num, and below with the retro-peritoneal space in the abdomen through the aortic opening iu the diaphragm. The CEsophagus (Fig. 271, 29) is a muscular tube continuous with the pharynx. It begins opposite the lower border of the 6th cervical vertebra, and lies sHghtly to the left side of the median line in the neck, as it passes through the superior aperiure of the thorax. About the 5th thoracic vertebra it regains the middle line, and then follows the cuiwe of the spine down to the level of the 10th thoracic vertebra, at which point it bends forward and to the left to pass through the oesophageal opening in the diaphragm, tei-nunatmg in the stomach opposite the lower border of the same vertebra. In front of it, in the chest, lie the trachea, the right pulmonary artery, "the left common carotid artery, the left recurrent larj-ngeal and left vagus nerves, the pericardium, and some bronchial lymphatic glands. Belind are the thoracic vertebra, the longi coUi, the thoracic duct, the left azygos veins, the vena azygos major (sUghtly overlapped), the right intercostal arteries, the right vagus, and the aorta (below) To the right are the right pleura and Imig and some bronchial r^lands; to the h-ft the posterior part of the horizontal aoi-ta and the uppor part of the dorsal aorta, the left subclavian artery, the left va-nis, the left pleura and lung, and the thoracic duct (above). fts relations in the neck are given at p. 427. In the abdomen it Hes in a notch in the back of the left lobe of the liver, close to the lobus Spigolii, and is invested by peritoneum.THE THORACIC DUCT. 575 It is supplied by the inferior thyroid arterj', the tiorta and the gastric artery. Its veins join the inferior thja'oids, the vena azygos and the gastric. Its nerves come from the oesophageal jalexus of the vagi and from the first thoracic ganglion. The oesophagus is fi-om nine to ten inches in length, and consists of an outer connective tissue coat, beneath which are two layers of ■muscular fibres, the outer longitudinal and the inner circular, both of the sti'iped variety in the upper part, but unstriped in the lower part of the tube. The muscular coat is lined by a layer of sub- mucous tissue with a muscularis niucosfe, and a simjile mucous membrane with papillae and stratified epithelium, which is thrown into longitudinal folds when the oesophagus is not distended with food. The glands in the mucous membrane are of the compound racemose variety. The long meshes of nerve-fibres upon the oesoijhagus are derived from the two pneumo-gasbrics, and form the jile.rus (julw. The Thoracic Duct (Fig. 273, 15) is a delicate tube about eighteen inches long, embedded in loose tissue between the aorta and the vena azygos major. By cutting away the remains of the diaphragm carefuUy, if the abdomen has been dissected, it may be traced from the receptarulum cliyli (33) opposite the second lumbar vertebra, and wiU be found to pass behind the right renal artery, and thi-ough the aortic opening to the right side of the aorta. In the thorax it continues to the right of the aorta, Ijdng between it and the vena azygos major and superficial to the intercostal arteries, as high as about the fourth thoracic vertebra; then crossing obliquely to the left of the spine above the arch of the aorta, it mns alon'o- the left side of the cesojAagus through the superior aperture of the thorax. In the neck the duct usually terminates in the left sub- clavian vein, close to its jmiction with the left internal jugular (6) [vide p. 422); but occasionally rises higher in the neck, and opens mto the jugular at the junction of the vein with some irregular tnbutaiy. It has valves at various points, and near its entrance into the vein maybe found a pair, which prevent the reflux of blood into the duct. The thoracic duct receives the whole of the lymphatics of the body except those of the right pleura and lung, the right side of the heart, the right side of the head and neck and the right upper extremity, all of which are drained by the riglit lymphatic trunk. Between the ribs close to the vertebrso may be found sou^c inter- costal lymphatic (/lands, the efferent vessels of which open into the duct. CEsophageal and bronchial glands may also bo seen in con- nection with the tubes of the same name.576 THE THORAX. The Vena Azygos Major (Fig. 274, 15) usually commences in the right ascending lumbar vein, and is to be traced through the aortic orifice of the diaphi-agm. It lies to the right of the thoracic duct upon the vertebra3, crossing the right intercostal arteries, and Fig. 273. Fig. 273.—The thoracic duct (drawn 1 1. Right common carotid. 2.

About the level of the seventh thoracic vertebra it receives the renu azijgos minor (i8), passing from the left side behind the aorta, and very generally a vertebra or two higher receives the Jeft itppcr azijgos vein (i6). It then arches forward over the right bronchns, and after receiving the right superior intercostal vein and the right hmnchiiil vein, opens into the superior vena cava just out- side the pericardium. The left superior intercostal vein opens into the left innominate vein. The veins of the intercostal spaces of the right side hence all terminate in one trunk, while those of the left side usually end in three different trunks; all, however, but those of the first and second spaces on the left side, eventually conimiuii- eating with the vena azj'gos major. The two ajiygos veins of the left side sometimes join to form a single trank, and occasionally some of the intercostal veins may pass immediately across to the great azygos vein. The azygos veins contain some imperfect valves, and form an important communication between the superior and inferior vense cava?. The great azygos vein represents the right carduial vein of the fcctus. The Bight Pneumo-gastric Nerve (Pig. 271, 6) has been seen to enter the thorax between the subclavian ai-tery and right innominate vein (p. 422). It may now be ti-aced backward to the right side of the trachea, towards the bifurcation, giving off the anterior pulmonary plexus, then passing bdiind the root of the lung to break up into the posterior prulmonary plexus, which receives communicating branches fi'om the four upper thoracic ganglia of the sympathetic. From this position it runs by the side of the CBsophagus, then behind it, dividing into branches, which unite with branches of the left pneumo-gasti-ic to form the plexus gulm around the tube. Finally the nerve passes, with the esophagus, through the opening in the diaphi-agm and is distributed to the back of the stomach. Cardiac branches arise from the trunk of the nerve in the thorax, and join the deep cardiac plexus. 18. Left phrenic nerve. 28, Left pul.nonary vein. I J. Kig It pulmonary vein. 29.

The oesophagus with branches from the left pneumo-gastiic will be seen near the diaphragm, and upon displacing it, the descending thoracic aorta wUl be brought into view, with the left splanchnic nerves and azygos veins.] The Left Pneumo-gastric Nerve (Fig. 272, 31) enters the thorax between the left carotid and subclavian arteries, and behind the left innominate vein. It descends between the horizontal arch and the left lung, giving off its recurrent lavijmjeal branch and the anterior 2^uIinoitari/ plexus, and passes behind the root of the left hmg and m front of the descending aorta, there giving off the pos- terior puhnonary plexus. It then reaches the front of the oesophagus, and joins in the formation of the plexus </uke ; finally passing thi'ough the oesophageal opening in the diaphragm. The recurrent lurynyeal branch runs outside the remains of the ductus arteriosus, and upwards on the right of the horizontal aorta, ascending to the neck in the sulcus between the trachea and oesophagus. It gives off cardiac nerves to the deep cardiac plexus. The Dorsal or Descending Thoracic Aorta (Pig. 273, 26) is the continuation of the arch of the aorta, and extends from the lower border of the fifth thoracic vertebra to the lower border of the twelfth thoracic vertebra, opposite which it passes thi-ough the aortic opening in the diaphragm to become the abdominal aorta. In its coui-se it Hes at first to the left, but afterwards in front of the bodies of the vertebrae, and crosses the left azygos veins. It is crossed by the root of the left lung and by the oesophagus; the latter at fii-st lying to the right side, but afterwards passing in front and then a Httle to the left side of the vessel, close to the diaphragm. The pericardium also touches it in front. The thoracic duct and the vena azygos major keep to its right side, and it is Fig. 274.—Veins of the trunk and ueok (from Cruveilhier). 1.

The deacendiwi portion of the. arch, which lies in contact with the body of the fifth thoracic vertebra, is sometimes described as a part'of the descending thoracic aorta (page 567). Branches.—From the front of the aorta are given off pericardiac, left bronchial, cesophucjml, and mediastinal branches. From the back part of the aorta arise the right and left intercostal arteries, which will be afterwards traced. a. The pericardiac branches are small and irregular. h. The left bronchial arteries, two in number, run on the posterior surface of the bronchus, and supply blood to the tissues of the limgs. The right bronchial artery usually arises fi'om the fii-st aortic intercostal of that side, but sometimes from the main trunk. A bronchial vein accompanies each artery; the right opening into the vena azygos major, and the left into the left superior intercostal vein. c. The wsophageal arteries are four or five small branches to the guUet, anastomosing above with the inferior thyroid, and below with the gasti'ic arteries. d. The mediastinal arteries are small twigs to the cellular tissue and glands of the posterior mediastinum. They anastomose with the pericardiac and oesophageal arteries, and foim part of the sub- pleui-al mediastinal plexus of Turner. [The trachea is to be cut just above the bifurcation, and the lungs are then to be removed from the chest and kept for sub- sequent examination. The intercostal vessels, the azygos venis, and the gang-bated cord of the sympathetic, with its branches, are now to be dissected out by removing the plem-re, and opportiuuty may be taken to fqUow out the thoracic duct, if this was not done satisfactorily before.] The Aortic Intercostal Arteries (Fig. 274), nine or ten iu number on each side, arise from the back part of the aorta, and supply the nine or ten lower intercostal spaces, anastomosmg \^ith the superior intercostal artery above. The arteries of the right side are necessarily longer than those of the left, owing to the position of the aorta to the-left side of the median line. The upper arten. ^ ascend to reach theii- proper intercostal spaces, but the lower vessels riui transversolv, passing beneath the cvsophagus. thoracic duct, vena azygos major, and gangliated cord of the sympathetic on the right side; and beneath the left azygos veins and the gangliated cord of the sympathetic on the left side. Each artery gives off close to the vertebra? a Posterior branch, which passes backwards between the ti-ansverso processes, dividing581 THE INTERCOSTAL NERVES. Fig. 275. into ii }7i>iscular branch to the miiscles of the back, and a small spiudl branch to suppljr the spinal cord and the body and arch of each vertebra (Fig. 259). The intercostal arteries lie at first against the external intercostal muscles, and are covered only by the pleurte. A vein and nerve are in relation with each artery, the vein being highest and the nerve lowest in most of the spaces, but the artery lies below the nerve in the three or four upper spaces (Fig. 275). The artery then disappears beneath the internal intercostal, and gives off its collateral branch, which follows the upper border of the lower rib of the .space, and, like the terminal branch, anastomoses wath the intercostal branches of the internal mammary. The Intercostal Veins (Fig. 274), with the exception of those from the iipper two or three spaces on the left side, receive spmal and miiscular tributaries, and open into the azygos veins on each side. The vena azygos major of the right »side has been already seen. ; • The Vena Azygos Minor (Fig. 274, i8), commencing in the left lumbar veins or ui the renal vein, juerces the left cms of the diaphragm and receives the lower intercostal veins of the left side ; it has been seen to pass behind the aorta and open into the vena azygos major. The upper intercostal veins of the left side form the superior intercostal and left upper azygos trunks, the terminatioi^ of which has been described (page 421). The Intercostal Nerves (Fig. 272), the anterior branches of the thoracic nerves, are eleven in number on each side, and arc dis- tributed to the fi'ont and sides of the chest and abdomen, supplyino- muscular and cutaneous branches. Each of the nerves of the 2nd Ard, 4fh, oth am/ 6th interspaces, it carefidly traced, will be seen to Fig. 275.--Sectioii of an intercostal space.

Finally, after passing in front of the internal mammaiy vessels, it tiu-ns forward, pierces the internal intercostal muscle, the external intercostal aponeui'osis, and the pectoralis major, and ends by sup]3lying the skin of the front of the chest. It gives muscular branclies in its course to both intercostals, to the levatores costarum, seiTatus posticus superior, infracostals, and triangularis sterni. The lateral cutaneous branches of the 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th nerves pierce the external intercostal muscles and the intei-vals between the digitations of the serratus magnus, and break up into anterior and posterior divisions, which are distributed to the skin over the lateral aspect of the thorax. The first nerve usually receives a communicating twig from the second (Cunningham), gives only a small branch to the first intercostal space, and has no lateral cutaneous branch; it then passes through the superior aperture of the thorax, across the neck of the fii-st rib, lying externally to the superior intercostal artery and first thoracic ganglion, and joining the eighth cervical nerve it helps to foinn the brachial plexus. The lateral branch of the secovd does not break up into anterior and posterior thoracic divisions, but passes to the arm, where it joins the lesser internal cutaneous nei-ve (see upper extremity). The intercostal nerves below the sixth follow an analogous com-se, but on escaping from the intercostal spaces, they run forwards between the internal obHque and transversalis muscles to enter the rectus abdominis, and, emerging fi-om this muscle near the nuddle^ line, they tenninate in the superjacent integiunent. Then-mmciilar branches supply the interco.stals, levatores costarum, sen-atus posti- cus inferior, obliqui, transversahs, and rectus. The lateral cutaueoM branches divide like those of the upper intercostals, and end m the skin of the abdomen over the interval between the rectus and erector spintB. It is fi-om these that the twigs to the external oblique are derived. The last thoracic m-rve lies below the last nb, and is distributed to the outer part of the buttock and the anterior abdominal wall. ^ . The Gangliated Cord of the Sympathetic (Fig. 271, 31/ placed over the heads of the ribs on each side of the thorax, just583 THE INTERCOSTAL MUSCLES. outside the posterior mediastinum and beneath the pleura, and is connected above with the inferior cervical ganglion, which should now be dissected on the neck of the first rib. The thoracic ganglia are generally said to correspond to the ribs in number, but the first ganglion often blends with the inferior cervical ganglion; and occasionally two of the lower gan- glia are united. Each gangKon Fig. 276. CARDIAC artel [ AORTIC PULMONARY OESOPHAGEAL gives off uscendiiKj and descending branches of communication with the ganglia above and below, ex- ternal branches (usually two) to the thoracic spinal nerves, and interimJ branches of distribution (Kg. 276). The internal branches from the five or six upper ganglia are given to the vertebras and their Ligaments, the oesophagus, and the j)osterior pulmonary and aortic plexuses. From the internal branches of the six or seven lower ganglia arise the sj^lanchnic nerves and branches to the aortic i:)lexus. Splanchnic Nerves (Pig. 271,43). The fjrrat splanchnic nerve is derived from five ganglia (6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th) by separate fibres. It runs inwards in the posterior media- stiiumi and, after piercing the crus of the diaphragm, joins the semi- hmar gangHon and the renal and suprarenal plexuses in the ab- domen. The lesser sp/anchnic ■ nerre is derived from the 10th and 11th ganglia, and also pierces the crus of the diaphragm to join the solar, renal, and suprai'enal plexuses. The least splanchnic nerve is derived from the 12th ganglion, and goes to the renal plexus. The Internal Intercostal Muscles (Fig. 274) can be seou beneath the plomfe without any further dissectitm. Beginning at the sternum the muscles reach as far as the angles of the Hbs, ,„7 tEJSER ^ Z^., SPLANCHNIC I Fig. 276.—The sympathetic chiiin in the thorax (from Wilson).THE THORAX. ^84: beliind wMcli points are visible the intercostal vessels and nerve.-r lying against the external intercostals.

The Subcostales or Infracostales consist of planes of muscular fibre passing from one rib to the second or third rib below, in the direction of the internal intercostal muscles. They are situated near the angles of the ribs, are supjilied by the intercostal nerves, and are muscles of expiration. The relation of the parts passing through the Superior Aperture of the Thorax can be now fuUy understood, and will be found in the accompanying table (p. 584) and the diagram taken fi-om nature (Fig. 277). The Upper Surface of the Diaphragm (Pig. 278) will also be thoroughly exposed. The structures in relation with it- have been already dissected, but these should again be carefuUy studied in connection with the muscle. [The lungs, which have been removed and laid aside, are to be dissected, and the structure of the trachea and lungs should be examined.] The Trachea (Pig. 279, i) extends from the lower border of the 6th cervical vertebra to thut of the 4th thoracic vertebra. It is about four inches and a half in length, convex in fi-ont but flattened posteriorly, and is composed of a series of incomplete cartilaginous rmgs, the extremities of which are connected behind by fibrous and muscular tissue. There arefi-om sixteen to twenty cartilages, each measm-ing about two Hues in depth, but decreasing in this dimension from above downwards : the last is pecviliar in being cut obliquely on each side, so as to be adapted to the commencement of the two bronchi. The cartilages are connected together by elastic fibrous tissue, and the first is similarly connected to the cricoid cartilage. On dissecting away the fibrous tissues at the back of the trachea, together with numerous mucous glands, transverse involuntary muscular fibres [tracheulis muscli') will be seen connecting the extremities of the cartilaginou-s rings. Within this is a longi- tudinal layer of elastic fibres, closely connected with the submucous tissue. The epithelium of the mucous membrane is columnar and cibated. On looking into the lower end of the trachea, a septum will bo seen between the two bronchi, but placed a little to the loft of the median line; this favours the passage of foreign bodies into the right bronchus, the orifice of which is larger than that of the loft. If the bronchi be traced into the lung by dissecting off the pul- monary tissue, it will be found that each maiu bronchus extends586 THE THORAX. to the base of the l\mg, the left (3) foiming a sigmoid cm-ve round the heart. They give off lateral branches in two seiies, dorsal and ventral (5, 6, 7), besides other less regular in an-angement; and the right gives off in. addition a large epdrterial branch (Fig. 279, 4), Fig. 278. which passes above the pulmonary artery to the upper lobe of the lung. The branches of the pulmonary artery lie in immediate con- tact with the back of the bronchi and follow their course acciu-ately: those of the pulmonary veins lie for the most part on the ventral aspect, and are not quite so regular.

The muscular fibres, which were limited to the back of the large bronchi, surround the smaller tubes, and extend a little further than the cartilages. The fibrous and elastic coats may be followed even into the smallest ramifications of the air-tubes, which thus become eventually membranous. The minute hroudria terminate in intercellular passages, and opening out of these are air- cells, or alveoli, the septa between which are formed hj reduplications of the lining membrane. The aii'-cells avera.ge about ifeth of an inch in diameter, and are lined with squamous epitheliiim. The air-cells and intercellular passages collected around the extremity of each minute bronchial tube form a lohide or infundi- hulum, and these aggregated together constitute the substance of the lung, but the air-cells of one lobule have no connectiim with those of another. The pulmonary artery subdivides like the bronchus it accom- panies, and gives a branch to each lobule. It ends in a plexus of capillaries distributed beneath the mucous membrane of the aii-- cells and their septa, and on the.walls of the intercellular passages, anastomosing with the terminal branches of the bronchial arteries, but not with the capillaries of the adjacent lobules. The pulmonary veins convey the arterialised blood fi-om the lobules, and correspond to the branches of the arteries. They have no valves, and the veins of different lobules anastomose freely. The hronchial arteries, arising on the right side from the 1st aortic intercostal artery, on the left from the thoracic aorta, may be traced upon the bronchial tubes for some distance. They supply the substance of the lung, and theii- blood is retm-ned partly by the bronchial veins and partly by the pulmonary veins. The bronchial veins of the right side open into the vena azygos major, and on the left into the superior intercostal vein. The nerves of the lungs are the anterior and posterior pulmonary plexuses, which are derived from the pneumo-gastrics, reinforced by filaments from the fo\ir upper thoracic sympathetic ganglia. They can be traced upon the bronchial tubes for some distance, and are said to have minute ganglia developed upon them. The lymphatics of the lung are connected with the hronchial ylaials found about the bifurcation of the trachea. Those of the right lung pass to the right lymphatic trunk, those of tho loft to the thoracic d)ict. AJITICULATION OF TJIK RlliS WlTll TUK VEia'El)ll.E. The ligaments of the ribs jnay be divided into two sets, (1) those connecting the ribs with the bodies of the vertebi-se (costo-vertebml),589 ARTICULATIONS OF THE RIBS. and (2) those connecting the ribs with the transverse processes (costo-transverse). 1. The Costo-vertebral ligaments are Anterior, Capsular, and Inter-articular. The Anterior Costo-vertebral or Stellate Ligament (Fig. 280, 2) consists of tkree short fasciculi, which radiate from the anterior sm-face of the head of the rib. The superior fasciculus passes to the vertebra above ; the middle fasciculus to the inter- vertebral substance; the inferior fasciculus to the vertebra below. The whole hgameut is closely connected with the anterior common ligament of the vertebra?. In the case of the first, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth ribs, which articulate each with a single vertebra, the stellate Ligament is attached principally to that vertebra, but sends a few fibres to the vertebra above. The Capsular Iiigament is a thin layer of fibres surrounding the articulation where the anterior ligament is wanting. The Interarticular Ligament (Fig. 280, 4) is seen by re- moving the stellate ligament, and is a short band passing between the lidge on the head of the rib and the intervertebral substance, and dividiag the articulation into two parts, each with a separate sijnovial memhrane. It is absent fi'om the articulations of the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth ribs, which have each a single sj'novial membrane. 2. The Costo-ti-ansverse ligaments are Anterior, Posterior, and Middle. The Anterior Costo-transverse Ligament (Fig. 280, 3) is attached to a rough ridge on the upper border of the neck of each of the ribs, except in the case of the first, and ascends to the lower border of the transverse process of the vertebra above. It separates the anterior from the posterior division of the intercostal nerves. The Posterior Costo-transverse Ligament (Fig. 281, 4) is a short thick band passing outwards from the apex of the transverse process of the vertebra to the rough non-articular portion of the tubercle of the rib (Fig. 282, 5). [In order to see the middle costo-transverse ligament, it will be necessary to make a horizontal section through the transv erse process of a vertebra and the neck of the corresponding rib, when the short ligament will Ijo found between the two.] The Middle Costo-transverse Ligament (Fig. 282, 4) consi.sts of short strong fibres, passing Ijetwoen the posterior sm-face of the neck of the rib and the anterior surface of the corresponding trans- Verse process. \590 THE THORAX. A synovial membrane exists between the facet upon each of the transverse processes of the ten upper thoracic vei'tebrse and the articular tubercle of the corresponding rib. The anterior extremity of each rib has a hollow into which the costal cartdage fits, the two structures being firmly united by the periosteum. Chondro-Sternal Articulation.—^The cartdages of the ti-ue ribs fit into depressions on the side of the sternum, and are attached by anterior and ijosttrior ligaments. A band attachuig Fig. 280.

[The ligaments of thaspuial column are to be examined by remov- mg all the remaining muscular fibres.] The ligaments of the Bodies of the vertebrte are—1, the Anterior Common Ligament; 2, the Posterior Common Ligament; and 3, the Intervertebral Substance or Pibro-cartilage. The Anterior Common Ligament (Fig. 280, i) is a broad band of fibres extending down the front of the vertebral column, from the axis to the sacrum. The fibres are attached principally to the intervertebral substances, and slightly to the upper and lower margins of the vertebrne; the deep fibres passing between the adjacent bones, while the superficial cross thi-ee or more ver- tebras. The ligament, when divided, will be seen to be thicker opposite the bodies of the vertebra; than on the intervertebral substances; and it is broader m the lumbar than in the cervical and thoracic regions.

[To see the posterior common ligament it will be necessary to remove the spinal cord, if this has not been already done. The saw is to be applied over the pedicles of, say, six dorsal vertebrae, and these being divided on each side, the remains of the spinal cord can be removed, when the posterior ligament will be seen on the backs of th e bodies of the vertebrte. The ligamenta subflava can be dissected upon the vertebral arches which have been sawn away.] The Posterior Common Ligament (Fig. 283, 3) is fomid upon the posterior aspect of the bodies of the vertebrtB from the axis to Fig. 283. FifC. 284. the sacrum. Unlike the anterior common ligament it is broad opposite the intervertebral substances, with which it is closely connected, and narrow opposite the bodies of the vertebroe ; and is broader in the cervical than in the lumbar region, and thickest m the thoracic region. It is composed of superficial and deep fibres like the anterior ligament. The Intervertebral Substances (Fig. 283, i) are found between the bodies of all the vertebra? from the axis to the sacrum, and are largest in the lumbar region. Each disc is composed of concentric layers of fibrous tissue and fibvo-cartilage externally, with a soft elastic material in the centre. The discs are thicker - Fig. 283.—Posterior lig.uucnt of the vertebnt (from Wilson). 1, 1. Intervertebral substances. 3. Posterior common ligament. 2. Pedicles of vertebrie sawn through.

On dissecting the concentric laj'crs of an intervertebral substance, their fibres will be found to pass obliquely between the adjacent vertebrte, taking opposite directions by alternate layers. By cutting thi-ough the attachment to one of the vertebrae with a strong knife, a pulpy material in the centre will be seen to expand considerably above the level of the fibro-cartilaginous rings around it: this is probably a relic of the chorda dorsalis of the embryo. The Artiviihir Processes are surrounded by Capsular Ligaments (Fig. 284, 2), which are looser in the cervical than in the thoracic and lumbar regions; they permit a simple gliding movement between the processes. Each joint has a simple synovial mem- brane. The Arches are united by the Ligamenta Subflava (Fig. 284, i). These are to be seen on the internal surfaces of the arches which have been removed, and wiU be found to consist of a series of yeUow elastic ligaments, extending between the lamince of the vertebrae on each side of the middle line, fi'om the axis to the sacrum. Owing to the overlapping of the lamina?, the ligaments are attached to the posterior surface of the arch below and to the anterior sui-face of the arch above (Fig. 281, 2). The Sirinous Processes are united by (1) the Interspinous and (2) the Supraspinous ligaments, both of which give attachment to muscles. The Interspinous Ligaments are placed between the spinous processes of the vertebrae, extending from the root to the tip of each. They are stronger in the lumbar than in the thoracic, and in the thoracic than in the cervical region. The Supraspinous Ligament (Fig. 281, i) is a fibrous cord extending along the tips of the spinous processes, from the last cervical vertebra to the sacrum. It is continuous with the Irga- vientiim nnchw, and is thicker in the lumbar than in the thoracic region. It is composed of superficial and deep fibres, which have the same arrangement as those of the anterior and posterior common ligaments. The Transverse Processes are connected by Intertransverse Ligaments, which are round and thick in the thoracic, and thin and membranous in the lumbar region. They are frequently absent in the cervical region.PAET VI. DISSECTION OF THE BACK AND SPINAL CORD. In dissecting tlie back it is customary for the owners of the arms to take the first two layers of muscles, while the dissectors of the head and neck claim such of the superficial muscles as are contained in their part, and complete the dissection of the remainder of the region, including the spinal cord. [An incision is to be made from the occiput to the sacrum in the median line, and another along each crest of the iliuna at right angles to it. The dissectors should then raise the skin with aU the subcutaneous tissues down to the superficial muscles, through which the cutaneous nerves appear. On the left side of the subject, the arm is to be drawn forward so as to put the latissimus dorsi on the stretch, and the dissector should begin to clean the lower part of that muscle, and work upwards to the trapezius. On the right side the arm should be pulled down at tii-st, and the head drawn over to the opposite side with hooks, to put the upper fibres of the trapezius on the stretch, and the dissector must begin at the upper border of that muscle (already exposed in the posterior triangle) and work downwards to the latissimus dorsi. On both sides, the arm and scapula will require to be moved from time to tune to stretch the different sets of fibres in tui-n.] The Cutaneous Nerves (Fig. 288) are derived from the posterior divisions of the spinal nerves, and are mostly of smaU size; but the upper thoracic nerves reach the shoulder, and the lumbar the buttock. The cervical and upper six thoracic cutaneous nerves pierce the trapezius close to the spine, the second, and sometimes a branch of the thii-d, cervical turning up to the occiput (the smalL occipital nerve fi-om the third being much smaller than the grra; occipital from the second, and lying internally to it). There is no cutaneous branch from the 1st; and those of the 6th, 7th, and Stli cervical nerves are of small size. The lower six thoracic and three lumbar nerves appear near the angles of the ribs, and pierce the latissimus dorsi along the obUque line at which the muscular fibresTHE TRAPEZIUS. 595 commence ; and the sacral nerves give usually two small branches through the tendinous expansion near the spine. The First Layer of Muscles (Fig. 285) consists of the Tra- pezius and Latissimus Dorsi. The trapezius partially overlaps the latissimus, but between them and the base of the scapula is a small triangular interval, in which the lower fibres of the rhom- boidcus major can be seen, and, below that muscle, the posterior sm'faces of two or three ribs and their intercostal muscles. The Trapezius (Fig. 285, i) of one side is triangular, but the . two muscles together resemble a trapezium. It arises from the external occipital protuberance and inner thii-d of the superior curved line of the occipital bone; fi'om the ligamentum nuchte and the seventh cervical spinous process ; and from the spinous processes of all the thoracic vertebrae and the supraspinous ligaments. The fibres converge to be inserted into the outer third of the posterior border of the clavicle, and into the inner border of the acromion process and the upper border of the spine of the scapula, as far as the tubercle at the outer angle of the basal triangle. This bony eminence receives the insertion of a tendon, which glides over the basal ti'iangle (and is separated from it by a bm-sa) and receives the lower two-thirds of the thoracic fibres of the muscle. The fibres thus have difPerent directions, and the action of the muscle upon the scapula varies according to the portion brought into use. The action of the entii-e muscle is to di-aw the scapula towards the spine, and thus the two trapezii throw back the shoulders. The upper fibres, acting alone, elevate the shoulder girdle, the lower fibres depress and retract it. When the scapulae are fixed by other muscles, the two trapezii extend the head and neck, or one muscle acting by itself woidd di-aw the head and spine to the same side. It should be noticed that a large oval tendinous aponem-osis {speculum rhomboideum), divided into two symmetrical halves by the spine, separates the bellies of the two muscles opposite the last cervical and three or foiu- upper thoracic vertebrEe—a substitution of tendon for muscle that probably has reference to the com- paratively smaH range of movement of the scapula backwards at this point. The trapezius has been seen to be supplied by the spinal-accessory nerve and branches of the 3rd and 4th cervical nerves. It is doubt- ful whether it receives branches from the posterior divisions of the nerves which pierce it. The Ufinmentnin NucJm is a band of white fibrous tissue, which extends from the prominent spinous process of the seventh cervical vertebra to the external occipital protuberance and crest, and is QQ 2THE BACK. 596 connected by small slips with the spines of the intervening vertebrse. It intervenes between, and gives origin to, the muscles of the two Fig. 285.

In some of the lower animals, it is of large development and composed of yellow elastic tissue, and gives an important support to the head. The Latissimus Dorsi (Fig. 285, 4) arises by a tendinous origin fi-om the posterior thii-d of the outer Hp of the crest of the ilium, and the upper sacral spines ; from all the lumbar and the six lower thoracic spines and the supraspinous ligament; and from the outer sm-faces of the thi-ee or four lower ribs, interdigitating with the external oblique muscle of the abdomen. The broad muscular fibres become collected together as they wind round the inferior angle of the scapula, to which they sometimes have a slight attach- ment, and then pass forward and upward, at first behind, then below, and finally in fi'ont of the teres major, to be inserted into the bottom of the bicipital groove of the humerus. The fibres of the muscle are so twisted that those which were highest at their origin are lowest at the insertion, and vice versa. At its insertion the tendon is separated from that of the teres major by a bursa p. 23). The latissimus dorsi, when taking its fixed point below, extends, adducts, and rotates the humerus inwards, di-awing it behind the back, and at the same time draws back the shoulder girdle (acting upon the stemo-clavicular joint); or if the arm is raised the muscle would depress it. When the humerus is fixed, the muscle would pull up the trunk, as in climbing, or might act upon the lower ribs as an extraordinary muscle of in.spii-ation. It is supplied by the long subscapular nerve, and perhaps also by the thoracic nerves which pierce it. [The trapezius is to be divided by a vertical incision near the spme, care being taken not to cut the subjacent tendinous origins of the rhomboidei in the cervical region. In reflecting the muscle its tendon will be seen to glide over the smooth triangular surface at the inner end of the spine of the scapula. Care must be taken of the spinal-accessory nerve and the accompanying branches of the superficial cervical artery. The posterior sui-face of the levator anguli scapulEe and rhomboidei muscles is now to be cleaned.] Second Layer of Muscles consists of the levator anguli scapulte and the rhomboidei. 14.

The Levator Anguli Scapulae (Fig. 285, lo) ariaea from the IDOsterior tubercles on the transverse processes of the upper fom- cervical vertebras, and is inserted into the base of the scapula opposite the supraspinous fossa. The surface of this muscle has been seen in the posterior triangle of the neck, where it covers the splenius coUi. The Bhomboideus Minor (Fig. 285, ii) is a narrow muscle, arisivg from the ligamentum nuchfe, and fi-om the spines of the seventh cervical and first thoracic vertebras, and the supra- spinous ligament. It is inserted into the base of the scajsula opposite the spine. The Rhomboideus Major (Fig. 285, 12) arises from the spinous processes of the upper fom- or five thoracic vertebi'SB below the fii-st, and the supra-spinous ligaments. It is inserted into the base of the scapula opposite the infra-sinnous fossa, the middle fibres being usually attached to a fibrous arch which is unconnected with the bone. The three muscles of the second layer act upon the scapula, drawing it upwards and inwards towards the spine. Acting in association with other muscles they tend to rotate the scapula at the acromio-clavicular joint, and to make the glenoid cavitj- look downwards. The superficial cervical artery passes over the outer surface of the levator anguli scapulse, and the posterior scapular ai-tery r\ms beneath this muscle to reach the hinder margin of the scapula, between the attachments of the rhomboids and serratus magnus. The levator anguli scapulas is supplied by branches from the 3rd and 4th cervical nerves, the rhomboids by branches fi-om the oth cervical. [The posterior belly of the omo-hyoid is to be traced out to the scapiila, and the levator anguli scapula^, rhomboidei, and the upper half of the latissimus dorsi are then to be divided, when thesnipiila can be drawn away from the ribs, and the inner surface of the serratus magnus muscle, with a quantitj- of loose cellular tissue between it and the ribs, will be brought into vie\v. This muscle is to be divided by a vortical incision, and the clavicle being sawn through (if this has not already been done), the arm will be attached onlv by the vessels and nerves, which may be cut and the lunl^ reuioved. Between the rhomboidei and the serratus \vill be seen the posterior scapular artery, and more externally the supra- scapular artery runs above the ligament of the notch while the nerve passes beneath it. The attachment of the ouio-hyoid muscle to the upper border of the scapula will also be exposed. The dissector of the arm ^vill proceed at once with the dissection ot599 THE SPLENIUS. the scapular muscles. The tendinous origin of the latissimus is then to be removed, and the serrati postici superior and inferior are to be defined.] The Third Layer of Muscles (Fig. 285) consists of the Serrati postici superior and inferior, and the Splenius capitis et colli. The Serratus Posticus Superior arises from the lower part of the ligamentum nuchre, the spinous processes of the seventh cervical and upper two thoracic vertebrae, and the corresponding supraspinous ligament; and it passes downwards to be inserted into the siiperior borders of the second, thir-d, foiQ'th, and fifth ribs, externally to their angles. The Serratus Posticus Inferior (Fig. 285, i6) arises from the spinous processes of the last two thoracic and uj)per two lumbar vertebrte and the interspinous ligaments, being blended at its origin with the latissimus dorsi and erector spinte; it passes uj^wards to be inserted into the lower borders of the last four ribs, externally to then- angles. The seiTatus posticus superior raises the ribs, and is therefore a muscle of inspiration ; the serratus inferior has a contrary action. The serratus posticus superior is supjjlied by the 2nd and 3rd intercostal nerves, and the serratus posticus inferior by the 10th and 11th intercostal. [The seiTati are to be divided and tiu'ned aside, and the splenius capitis and splenius colli are to be cleaned, when the posterior portion of the fascia covering the deeper muscles, and united more or less with the origins of the latissimus dorsi and serratus posticus inferior, as well as with the subjacent muscles, will be seen. The name of certehral aponeurosis has been given to the continuation of this structure beneath the serratus posticus superior and the splenius, and over the deep muscles; this is to be defined, and afterwards miist be removed.] The Splenius (Fig. 285) is single at its oriijin, but is divided into two parts at its insertion. It arises from the lower half of the ligamentum nuchse, and from the spinous processes of the seventh cervical and upper six thoracic vertebrtT3. The ■ij)/e>iiiis capitis (13), or upper portion, passes upwards and inwards to be inserted into the mastoid process, and into the outer third of the superior cruwed line of the occipital bone, immediately beneath the storuo-mastoid muscle. The splenius colli (14), or lower portion, is inserted into the poste- rior tubercles on the transverse processes of the upper three or four cervical vertobrce, beneath the levator anguli scapuhe. The splenii of both sides acting together ckaw the head alid neck600 THE BA.OK. backward. One muscle acting alone, draws the head backwards, lateralises it towards the corresponding shoulder, and rotates the face towards the same side. The splenius capitis was seen in the posterior triangle of the neck, above the levator anguli scapulas, but the splenius colli was hidden by this muscle. At the upper border of the S23lenius appear the nearly vertical fibres of the complexus, running to the interspace between the two curved lines of the occipital bone. The splenius is sappHed by the external branches of the lower cervical nerves. [The splenius must be reflected in order to show the complexus, which lies beneath it. In order to define the connections of the erector spinae, an interval is to be sought opposite the last rib, separating the muscular mass into two parts. The ouier segment is to be turned outwards and its attachment to the ribs and cervical transverse processes noted; it consists of the sacro-lumbaHs con- tinued upwards by the accessorius, and the cervicalis ascendeus. The inner segment when separated from a few muscular and ten- dinous bauds called the spinalis dorsi, j)assing between some of the thoracic and lumbar spines, will be foimd to consist of the longissimus dorsi prolonged upwards into the neck by the transver- salis colli and trachelo-mastoid. The aponeurosis covering the erector spinte is to be divided by an oblique incision, following the line of sejDaration between the muscles. In making this dissection the inner branches of the posterior divisions of the 'intercostal vessels and nerves will be found internal to the longissimus dorsi, and the external branches between the longissimus dorsi and the sacro-lumbaHs. The occij^ital artery will also be shown in the neck.] The Fourth Layer of Muscles (Fig. 2SG) consists of the SpinaHs dorsi, the Erector spinse with its subdivision^, and the Complexus. They are supplied bj'the external branches of the posterior div-isions of the spinal nerves, but the comi^lexus also receives twigs irom the internal branches. The Spinalis Dorsi (Fig. 286, 4) lies close to the spinous pro- cesses, arising from the lower two thoracic and upper two lumbar spinous processes, and is inserted into the spinous processes of tlie upper six thoracic vertebra?. It commonly interchanges slips with the longissimus dorsi, and is sometimes regarded as part of the erector spina?. The Erector Spinse (Fig. 286, i) is the great muscle filling up the hollow at the back of the sacrum and hmibar vcrtebrse. It arises from the posterior fifth of the uiner lip of the crest of the ilium and its posterior superior spine; from the spinous processes of the lumbar and two lower thoracic vertebraj; fi'om the upper four601 THE LONGISSIMUS DORSI.

In the loins its aponem-osis blends with the '' fascia lumborum " or posterior segment of the tendon of the transversalis abdominis muscle (v. p. 234). The Sacro-Iiumbalis or Ilio- Costalis (Fig. 286, 2) the smaller and more external of the two divisions, passes upwards and out- wards to be inserted into the angles of the six lower ribs, and is directly prolonged upwards by the two following muscles.

Quadratus lumborum.THE BACK. 602 (Fig. 286, 3), the inner division of the erector spinse, has two sets of insertions ; an inner, by tendinous slips into the trajisverse pro- cesses of all the thoracic vertebrae, and into the accessory tubercles of the lumbar vertebrae; and an outer, by fleshy slips into the ten lower ribs between their tubercles and angles, and into the trans- verse processes of the lumbar vertebra3. It is prolonged to the neck and head by two muscles, the transversalis cervicis and the trachelo-mastoid, both of which «r/A'efrom the transverse proces.ses of the five or six upper thoracic vertebras, the latter muscle having an additional origin from the articular processes of the four lower cervical vertebrae. The Transversalis Cervicis is inserted into the posterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the cervical ver- tebrfB fi'om the second to the sixth. The Trachelo-mastoid is inserted into the mastoid process beneath the splenius capitis. The Complexus arises from the articular processes of the 3rd, 4th, oth and 6th cervical vertebrae, from the transverse processes of the last cervical and six upper thoracic vertebrae, and fi-om the si)ine of the last cervical vertebra; it is inserted into the space between the superior and inferior curved lines, on the inner side of the area for the superior oblique. It is pierced by the great occipital and third cervical nerves. The most internal and superficial part of the complexiis has been called the Biventer Cervicis, from the fact that it consists of two fleshy portions or bellies with an intervening tendon. The erector spinre, with its continuations upwards, extends the entire spine and head if the muscles of the two sides act together. Acting singly, they lateralise and rotate the vertebrae. Occipital Artery (Eig. 287, 3)-—The second poi-tion of the occipital artery is now exposed in its coui-se between the muscles attached to the occipital bone. It has been seen to pass under the posterior belly of the digastricus, and disappear beneath the sterno- mastoid, splenius capitis, and trachelo-mastoid, to reach its groove in the mastoid portion of the temporal bone internally to the digastric groove. Finally it crosses the supei-flcial aspect of the superior oblique and complexus, and passes to the back of the scalp between the attachments of the sterno-mastoid and trapezius. Thf great occipital nerve, which has a similar distribution, pierces the complexus and trapezius to reach the occiput. The branches of the artery are (1) Mmcitlar to the sterno-mastoid, splenius, trachelo- mastoid, and digasti-icus; (2) Auricular to the back of the aunclo. anastomosing with the postcrius auricular of the external carotid : (3) Mtuimjeal, through the foramen lacerum posterius; (4) MastouL piercing the mastoid foramen to supply the mastoid ceUs and duraTHE OBLIQUUS INFERIOR. inator; (5) Princeps Ccrvia's, which runs downwards between the complexiis and semispinalis colli, sui^plying both and anastomosing- with the posterior branches of the vertebral and the deep cervical branch of the superior intercostal. It gives off a small supi-rficial cervical twig which runs superficially to the complexus, supplying the trapezius and anastomosing with the superficial cervical branch of the ti-ansversalis colli; (6) Huhncciiyital, anastomosing with muscular branches of the vertebral in the suboccipital triangle ; and (7) Terminal to tie occijDital portion of the scalp, anastomosing with the temporal, and giving a small parietal twig thi-ough the parietal foramen. The Occipital vein usiially passes deeply beneath the complexus to terminate in deep cervical vein. Before leaving the scalp it communicates with the lateral sinus thi-ough the mastoid foramen. [The complexus is to be divided transversely, at the point where the great occipital nerve pierces it, so as to preserve the nerve iminjured, and the muscle should be dissected up from the con- densed celhilar tissue beneath it and turned outward. The small muscles, with the vessels and nerves, of the suboccijiital region are then to be dissected out, together with the semispinaHs muscle, which fills the vertebral groove in the cervical and thoracic regions. AH vessels and nerves are to be carefully preserved.] Fiftli Layer of Muscles (Fig. 287) consists of the two Posterior Eecti, the two ObUqui, and the Semispinalis muscles. The recti and obliqui are supplied by the suboccipital nerves, and the inferior obhque also by a twig from the postei-ior division of the thii-d cervical. The semispinalis is supplied by the internal branches of the posterior divisions of the spinal nerves. The Rectus Capitis Posticus Major (Fig. 287, 8) arises fi-om the spinous process of the axis, and passes obliquely upward and outward beneath the cranial attachment of the superior oblique, to be inserted into the outer part of the inferior curved line of the occipital bone, and into a small portion of the space below it. The Rectus Capitis Posticus Minor (Fig. 287, 6) is placed close to the median line, and is slightly overlapped by the preceding muscle. It arises from the posterior tubercle of the atlas, and is inserted by fleshy fibres into the space below the inferior ciu'ved line on the occipital bone, close to the median line and to its fellow muscle of the opjiosite side. The Obliquus Inferior (Fig. 287, i8) arises from the spinous process of the axis, and is inserted into the posterior part of the extremity of the transverse pro(;ess of the atlas. The groat occipital nerve turns upwards around its lower border.604 THE BACK. Tke Obliquus Superior (Fig. 287, lo) arises from the transverse process of the atlas, and is inserted into the outer part of the inter- space between the superior and inferior curved lines of the occipital bone, the attachment being separated from.that of the complexus by an obUqiie ridge joining the two curved lines. The muscle overlaps the rectus major above, and the occipital artery runs along its upper border. It is Fig. 287. less oblique in directi(jn than the rectus major. Both recti muscles and the superior oblique, acting with theu- fellows of the opposite side, extend the head at the occipito-atlantal joint; and the rectus major, owing to its oblique direction, is also a rota- tor of the atlanto-axial joint, and sligbtly of the occipito - atlantal joint when acting singly. The inferior oblique is essen- tially a rotator of the atlanto-axial joint; and the superior oblique extends the bead at the occipito-atlantal, and may give rise to very limited movements of rotation and lateral inclination at the same articulation. It must be remembered that the motion of the atlanto-axial joint is purely rotatory, while that of the occipito- atlantal joint is mainly in the direction of flexion and extension, with a small range of rotation and lateral flexion. The Suboccipital Triangle (Fig. 287) is a nanw space covered in by the complexus, and bounded on its three sides by the rectus capitis posticus major, and the two obUqui; its floor being formed by the posterior arch of the atlas and the posterior occipito-atlantal Pig. 287.—Suboccipital region (drawn by J.

The Vertebral Artery (Fig. 287, 5) ascends thi'ough the fora- mina in the ti'ansverse processes of the six upjjer cervical vertebra?, and, having perforated the transverse process of the atlas, is seen in the suboccipital triangle, rimning horizontally inwards in the groove behiad the superior articular process of that bone, and piercing the posterior occipito-atlantal ligament to ascend into the skull through the foramen magnum. It gives small muscular and spiral branches in the intervals between the transverse processes, and its hoiizontal portion usually gives off a branch to supply the muscles in the suboccipital region and anastomose with the occijiital artery. The Muscular branches of the vertebral artery will be found between the semispinalis and complexus, suppljang the adjacent muscles, and anastomosing with the princeps cervicis of the occipital and the profunda ceiwicis of the superior intercostal. The Spinal branches behave like those of the intercostal and lumbar arteries, each giving off anterior and posterior branches {rami canalis) to the osseo-ligamentous spinal canal, and a medullary branch [ramus sjnnalis), which is conducted to the spinal cord by the nerve-root and anastomoses with the anterior and jjosterior spinal arteries. The Vertebral vein begins by one or two small tributaries in the neighbourhood of the transverse process of the atlas, and gains size in its passage through the vertebrarterial canal by receiving spinal and muscular tributaries. It escapes from the foramen in the ti-ansverse process of the sixth vertebi se, and ends in the subclavian vein. An accessory vertebral vein usually occupies the foramen in the transverse process of the seventh vertebra. The posterior division of the Suboccipital Nerve (Fig. 287, 7) (1st cervical) emerges between the occiput and atlas, and generally beneath the vertebral artery. It is of small size, and supplies branches to the recti and obliqui muscles, one to the comiDlexus, and a communicating branch to the great occipital. The Great Occipital Nerve (Fig. 287, 9) is the infernal branch of the posterior division of the second cervical nerve, and leaves the vertebral canal between the atlas and axis. It winds below the infei ior oblique, giving a branch to the complexus, and commu- nicating with the suboccipital nerve ; it then turns upward to pierce the complexus and trapezius muscles, and supply the skin of the occipital region as far as the lambdoid suture. The crternal branch of the posterior division of the second nerve supplies the splenius, complexus, and trachelo-mastoid muscles.THE BACK. cot) Fig. 2R8.607 THE SEMISPINALIS. The posterior division of the third nerve often gives an internal branch, which takes the same direction as the gi'eat occipital nerve, but runs to the inner side of this and communicates with it. The externa/ branch joins and is distributed with the corresponding branch of the second nerve. The posterior divisions of the remaining- cervical nerves divide into external and internal branches. The external branches supply the cervicalis ascendens and transversalis capitis et colli: the internal are distributed to the deeper and more internal muscles, and give off cutaneous filaments (those from the 4th and 5th of large size) to the integument over the posterior spinal muscles. The Deep Cervical Artery lies upon the semispinabs colli muscle, and is exposed when the complexus is reflected. It is the posterior branch of the superior intercostal arterj^ (p. 421), and reaches the back of the neck by passing between the tiunsverse process of the last cervical vertebra and the neck of the first rib. It supplies the deep muscles, anastomosing with the muscular branches of the vertebral, and with the princeps cervicis of the occipital artery. There is thus established between the carotid and subclavian arteries a communication which would enlarge after ligature of the common carotid artery. The Semispinalis (Fig. 286) is divided into the semispinalis colli and semispinalis dorsi, and lies between the complexus and the multifidus spinse. Semisjn'nalis colli (ii) arises horn the transverse processes of the SIX upper thoracic vertebrce, and is inserted into the spines of the cervical vertebrae from the 2nd to the oth inclusive. Semispinalis dorsi (lo) arises from the transverse processes of the dorsal vertebrae from the sixth to the tenth inclusive, and is Fig. 288.—The nerves of the back (from Hirschfeld and Leveille). 1.

Both segments are supplied by the posterior divisions of the cervical nerves. Spinal Nerves (Fig. 288).—The Posterior Divisions of all the spinal nerves (with the excojition of the first cervical, and foiu-th and fifth sacral, and the coccygeal) subdivide into internal and external branches, which sujiply all the muscles of the back, and give the following cutaneous branches : — The Internal branch of the 2nd and sometimes that of the 3rd cervical nerves supply the skin of the occiput, and those of the lower five cervical and upper six thoracic nerves become cutaneous near the spinous processes. The External branches of the lower six thoracic and of the upper three lumbar nerves become cutaneous at an oblique Ime corre-| sponding to the margin of the aponeui-osis of the latissimus dorsi. The External branches of the upper sacral nerves become cu' neous near the uiedian line. The fourth and fifth sacral nerves are very small and join with the coccygeal nerve. The Coccy(jeal nerve emerges fi-om the lower end of the vertebral canal and is distributed over the coccyx. The Posterior Divisions of the Intercostal and Lumbar Arteries divide like the nerves into spinal and muscular branches, and the latter into internal and external branches, which accompany the nerves to the muscles of the back. The Spinal branches supply the spinal canal by anterior and posterior rami canalis; and the spinal cord and its membranes by the medullary twigs or rami sjnnu/es. The latter reach the cord by accompanjang the nerve-roots, and hence follow a coui-se which becomes longer and more vei-tical as the organ approaches the lower end of the column. The Sixth Layer of Muscles (Fig. 286) consists of the Inter- spinales, Intertransversales, Multifidus Spinse, Levatores Costai-um, and, in the thoracic region, the Eotatores Spinre. These are all supplied by the internal branches of the posterior division of the spinal nerves. The position of the Interspinales and Interti-ansversales is siifiB- ciently indicated by then- names. They are double m the cervical and lumbar I'egions, but are ill-marked in the thoracic region. The Multifidus Spinse (i6) fills up the vertebral groove bciieatli the erector spinre. It arises from the articular processes of the four lower cervical, the mammillary processes of the lumbar, and from the transverse processes of the thoracic vertebrae; from the posterior surface of the saci-um and the tendon of the erectorTHE SPINAL CORD. 609 spiuie; and is insvrtnl into the spinous processes of all the vertebras except the atlas. Its fibres extend, lateralise, and rotate the cervical and thoracic vertebrfe; but only extend and lateralise in the lumbar region. The Riitatores Spince consist of deep fibres beneath the multifidus in the thoracic region ; thej^ pass from the root of each transverse process to the lamina of the vertebra above. There apjjears to be no advantage in regarding them as distinct from the multifidus. The Lemtori'S Costamm are fan-shaped muscles one to each rib, each passing between the extremity of the transverse process of the vertebra above and the upper border of the rib below, externally to the tubercle. They are muscles of inspiration. ^ The Spinal Coixb and Membranes. [To open the spinal canal, the remains of the muscles of the back should be cleared away as far as possible, when some part of the plexus of florsi-spiiiul veins may be seen Upon the vertebrte. A block then being placed beneath the thorax So as to make the thoracic region prominent, a cut is to be made with the saw oil each side of the middle line, so as to divide the lamina? of the vertebrfe as far out as possible. Two or three of the arches being now removed with the chisel, the point of a spine-chisel or rachet is to be introduced into the canal, and the instiaunent carefully hammered through the arches of the vertebree for the whole length of the .^pine, except the upper two cervical vertebl'se. The opera= tion being repeated on the opposite side, the arches call be removed with the bone-forceps, and the canal will be thoroughly opened. On the inner surface of the arches wiU be seen the ligameuta suh'- flam, which are desciibed with the other vertebral ligaments (p. 593).] Upon opening the Spinal Canal solne loose tissue and fat win be seen, together With a plexus of veins. The Spinal "Veins correspond to the intra-craliial sinuses, and consist of vessels which suiTound the theca Vertebralis, occupying' a space between the dura mater and periosteum of the spinal canal and communicating through the intervertebral foramina with the vertebral veins in the neck, the intercostal in the back, the ^lumbar, ilio-lumbar and sacral in the loins and sacral region. They may be divided into two intercommunicating sets, anterior and posterior, the posterlnr mainly longitudinal in direction, the anterior consisting of two longitudinal trunks joined together opposite the middle of the body of each vertebra by a transverse l)ranch, which receives the vmu banin viricbra. They receive the mnliill'i-spimi/ R R610 THE SPINAL CORD. veins which surround the cord between the piti mater and arach- noid, and they are continuous above at the foramen magnum with the occipital sinuses. The Dura Mater of the Cord is a fibro-serous jnembrane like and continuous with that of the brain, but diifers from it (1) in not serving as a periosteum to the Fig. 289. bones in which it lies, (2) in the absence of venous sinuses between its laminte, and (3) in not sending prolongations into the fissures of the nerve centre. It is connected to the pia mater by fine filaments of connective tissue, and by lateral tooth-Hke processes (ligumeida dmticidatu), which are attached to the sides of the cord opposite the interval between the anterior and posterior roots of each nerve (Fig. 289, 7). The dura mater is continuous above with that of the bram at the foramen magnum, and terminates below in a cul de sac about the middle of the sacrum, but is continued to the coccyx as a fibrous cord. By removing the ti-ausverse processes of two or thi-ee of the thoracic vertebras, tubes of dura mater may be traced upon each of the nerve roots to the intervertebral foramina. They are attached by connective tissue to the margins of the foramina, and eventually become lost upon the perineurium. [By opening one of the tubes of dura mater, the position of the ganglion iipon the posterior root in the intervertebral foraiuen will be seen. The cord is next to be removed by carrymg the knife along the outside of the dura mater so as to divide the nerves as tar out as possible; those which have been thoroughly exposed by the dissection being severed beyond the ganglion. The cord attachni- the dura mater to the coccyx is to be divided, and the sacral ner\ cut as long as possible, and lastly the dura mater divided trans- versely at the level of the axis. The cord when removed is to laid out on a table with the posterior surface uppermost and the opportunity may be taken of examining the anterior spinal veins m the vertebral canal.] Pi<r 289.—Transverse section of the spinn.1 cord and its meinbi-anes (from " Hirschfeld and Leveille). 1, 2.

By a bright shining cord {linea sjjleudeiis) running opposite the anterior median fissure. 2. By the presence of a single spinal artery, instead of two as on the posterior smi'ace. '6. By the smaller and non-ganglionic anterior nerve roots. 4. By the absence of the narrow median columns of Goll, seen on either side of the posterior siu-face in the uj^per part of the cord. The Arachnoid (Fig. 289, 2) is a delicate transparent membrane of connective tissue, separated fi'om the inner surface of the dm-a mater by the suhdurul space, and fi'om the pia mater by the suh- unichtioid sjma: It is pierced by the nerve roots and by the liga- menta denticulata. It was fonnerly described as consisting of a parietal and a visceral layer. The parietal layer, Hnrng the inner surface of the dm-a mater, is now regarded as the epithelium of that membrane; the arachnoid proper loosely invests the spinal cord, and gives sheaths to the several nerves. The space between the two layers of the arachnoid, or rather between the dura mater and the arachnoid, was formerly called the sac 0/the uraclmuid, but is now usually described as the subdural space. The Subarachnoid Space (Fig. 289, 5) lies between the visceral layer of the arachnoid and the pia mater of the spinal cord, and is of considerable extent; it can be shown by lifting up the arachnoid with forceps, or by inserting a blow-pipe and forcing air beneath the membrane. This space is filled with fluid and crossed by fine tiabeculee and membranous expansions of deHcate connective tissue. It communicates with the serous spaces of the brain by three openings, one in the posterior serous wall of the foiu-th ventricle (foramen of Magendie), and one in each lateral recess of the same space; and by this means the cerebral fluid may escape into the spmal canal when the intracranial pressm-e is increased. [The cord is to be tui-ned over so as to expose its anterior surface, and an incision is to be made through the dura mater to expose the arachnoid and subarachnoid space, as was done behind. The pia mater is then to be examined both on the front and back of the cord.] The Pia Mater encloses the spinal cord, giving prolongations upon the roots of the nerves. It is continuous with the pia mater of the brain, but is less vascular. It sends processes into the antenor and posterior median fissui-es of the cord, and at the termination of the spinal cord is prolonged upon the /Uum term iiuUe. RU 2THE SPINAL CORD. 612 It is tliickeiied opposite the anterior median fissiu-e to form the linea sphudens. The Ligamenta Denticulata (Fig. 290, i6) are found on each side of the cord, between the anterior and posterior roots of the nerves. They comprise a series of twenty-one or twenty-two serra- tions, connected with the pia mater between the anterior and posterior nerve roots, and with the inntr surface of the dui'a mater midway between the apertui'es of exit for the nerves, each denticulation being covered by a funnel-shaped sheath of arachnoid. They serve to sling the cord and secure it from shocks. The Anterior Spinal Arteri/ and the two Fusterior Spinal Arteries may be traced upon the cord, if well-iujected. They are branches of the vertebral arteries, the ante- rior being formed by the junction of a branch from each side (p. 619)- The arteries ramify in the pia mater, anastomosing with the spinal branches of the vertebral, iuter- costal, lumbar, ilio-lumbar and sacral vessels, which enter the vertebral canal through the ■p&vt of spinal cord and membranes, are removed on the left side (from Fig. 290.—Fourth ventricle and upper The posterior roots of the nerve Hirschfeld and Leveille). 1.

They communicate with the spinal veins by branches which run with the nerves to the intervertebral foramina, and above join the inferior cerebellar vein or the inferior petrosal sinus. The Spinal Cord (Figs. 290, 293) is a continuation of the meduUa oblongata into the spinal canal, and extends from the foramen magnum to the lower border of the first lumbar vertebra. I Fig. 291.

The last is fui'ther sub-divided, most distinctly in the cervical region, by a longitudinal fissure of small depth into a postero-lateral column, or Column of Burdach (Fig. 291, 17), and a postern-mesial column, or Column of Goll (Pig. 291, 18). The anterior roots of the nerves emerge at the antero-lateral line, marking off the anterior column fi'om the lateral colimin. At the bottom of the median fissures are the anterior and posterior commissures. The Spinal Nerves (Pig. 290) are thii-ty-one in niunber on each side .of the cord. Each nerve has been seen to arise by two roots, the posterior (except in the fii-st nerve) being larger than the anterior. The posterior roots have each a gang- lion, which is generally placed in the intervertebral foramen; and immediately beyond the ganglion, the anterior or motor and posterior or sensory roots unite to form a spinal nerve of mixed endowments. The first and second cervical, with the sacral and coccygeal neiwes, are exceptions to the general riUe as regards the position of the ganglia. The ganglia of the upper two cervical nerves lie upon the arches of the atlas and axis, at which point the roots of the nerves Fig. 293.

Each spinal nerve divides into an anterior and a posterior trunk, the anterior being the larger throughout, except in the 1st and 2nd cervical nerves, where they are of smaller size than the posterior. The majority of the spinal nerves divide just outside the interverte- bral foramina, but in the first cervical, the last sacral, and the coccygeal nerves, the division takes place within the dura mater ; and the upper four sacral nerves divide inside the sacral canal, the anterior and posterior trunks emerging at the anterior and posterior sacral foramina. Each anterior branch is connected to the sym- pathetic chain by one or two slender filaments. In a transverse section (Pig. 289) the spinal cord will be found to consist of white nervous matter, enclosing two symmetrical grey crescents. The convexities of these are tm-ned towards one another and connected together by two slender commissures, which He at the bottom of the anterior and posterior median fissui-es. Each crescent terminates in front and behind by expansions called cornua. The anterior cornua are the larger, but do not reach to the periphery of the cord; while the slender posteriur cornua are closely connected with the posterior roots of the spinal nerves in the lateral fissiu-e. A small central canal (canal of Stilling) exists throughout the cord, and communicates above with the lower angle of the foui'th ventricle of the brain (Fig. 291, 7). The anterior or white commissure passes in front of this, the posterior or grey commissure behind. It is impossible for the student in his ordinary dissection to investigate the minute anatomy of the spinal cord, and he is therefore referred to works on histology for fuller details. The tracts of the white fibres in the cord, as recognised by physio- logists, are shown diagrammatically in Fig. 292.PART VII. F DISSPJCTION OF THE BRAIN. Before dissecting the Membranes or Vessels of the Brain, it will be well to recognise the several parts of the Encejjhalon, as this will assist the student in following the description. The Encephalon consists of the Cerebrum, the Mid-Brain, the ''erelellmn, and the Medulla Oblongata; connected together bj' a commissural sfeructUi-e called the Poiis Varolii. The Cerebrum forms the greater part of the mass of the encephalon, and is incompletely divided by a vertical median fissure into two sj-mnietrical hemi- spheres, which are united by a large transverse commissure called the corjnis caUosum. The Mid-Brain lies between the cerebrum and the pons Varolii, and comprises the crura cerebri and corpora quadri- (jemina. The Cerebellnm lies beneath the hinder part of the cerebral hemispheres, and is attached by pedimcles to the cerebrum and meduUa oblongata. The Medulla Oblongata forms a kind of stem to the cerebrum and cerebellum, and passes downwards to the vertebral canal to become continuous with the spinal cord. The Pons Varolii consists of a. set of transverse fibres, commissm-al between the two halves of the cerebellimi, and a set of longitudinal fibres passing between the medulla and the rest of the encephalon. These parts will be readily recognised by referring to Fig. 298. The average weight of the brain in the adult is 48 ounces, in the female 43| ounces (Boyd). The proportion to the rest of the body averages 1 to 36'o, and is practically the same in the two sexes. [The brain is to be placed in a plate with the base upward, for the examination of the membranes and the dissection of the vessels.] The Membranes of the Brain, are the Dura Mater, the Arach- noid, and the Pia Mater. The Dura Mater has boon already seen as a fibro-serous mem- brane lining the skull, supporting the meningeal vessels, forming the rigid walls of the venous sinuses, and giving off processes separating the hemispheres of the brain from each other, and the hinder part of the cerebrum from the cerebellum (p. 367).DISSECTION OF THE BRAIN. 618 The Arachnoid is a connective tissue membrane moi'e or less closel}' related to the subjacent pia mater, but differing fi-om it in passing fi-om one convolution to another without dipping into the sulci. It is prolonged into the great longitudinal fissure between the hemispheres of the cerebi'uni, nearly as far as the corjms callo- sum, and may be traced over the base of the cerebrum to the cere- bellum and medvilla oblongata, ensheathing the various cranial nerves, and becoming continuous with the arachnoid of the spinal cord at the foramen magnum. The arachnoid presents minute villous processes, some of which tend to undergo hj^pertrophy and to cause absorption of the super- jacent dura mater and bone ; they are then known as Pacrhioniun bodies. It is separated from the dura mater by the subdural space, and from the pia mater by the subarachnoid space, but is connected with both membranes by delicate fibrous trabeculse. The Subarachnoid Space is occupied by a considerable quantity of cerebro-spinal fluid, and communicates with the cerebral ven- tricles and the subarachnoid space of the cord. It is largest at the base of the brain, in fi-ont of and behind the pons Varolii, and serves as a kind of water cushion to the nerve centres. The Anterior Subarachnoid Space, (diamond-shaped space) is im- mediately in front of the pons Varolii, and is f oi-med by the stretching of the arachnoid from one temporo-sphenoidal lobe of the cerebrum to the other, as far forward as the optic commissiu-e. The Posterior Subarachnoid Space wiU be found behind the pons and beneath the cerebeUum. This is continuous with the subarachnoid space of the spinal cord, and communicates with the interior of the brain by means of a centi'al aperture in the pia mater fonning the roof of the fourth ventricle, the foramen of MagencUe, and two lateral apertui-es, one at each lateral recess of the same ventricle. The Pia Mater is a vascular membrane closely mvesting the surface of the brain, passing into the sulci between the convolu- tions, and is continued into the interior thi-ough the transverse fissiu-e in the form of a triangular fold caUed the velum uder- positum, which will be subsequently examined. It becomes more tough and fibrous as it approaches the spmal cord, and whilo investing the latter its vascularity ahnost entii-ely disappears. [The arachnoid is to be removed from the arteries f the base^of the brain and these arc to be cleaned and their branches followed. ^VSl no^ be possible to show the lo^V^jt^idma fissiu-e betwm^ two frontal lobes of the cerebrum more clearly than before, and al.o the fissCe of Sylvius between the frontal and temporo-sphenoid.al lobes of each side.]THE ARTERIES OF THE BRAIN. 619 The Arteries of the Brain (Fig. 294) are derived fi-om four great trunks—the two vertebral and the two internal carotid arteries. The Vertebral Artery (i) has been seen as a branch of the subclavian arteiy, and has been traced thi'ough the transverse pro- cesses of the cervical vertebrae to the atlas. The artery pierces the posterior occipito-atlantal ligament and the dura mater between the occiput and the atlas, and enters the skull through the foramen magnum by the side of the medulla oblongata. At the lower border of the pons Varolii the two vertebrals imite to form the Basilar Artery (6), which passes along the middle line of the pons to bifurcate at its anterior border into the right aud left posterior cerehral arteries (8). The Branches of the Vertebral Artery are :— 1. A small Posterior Spirnd artery (3), running down the poste- rior sm-face of the spinal cord, and separated by a small interval from its feUow of the opposite side. 2. A smaU Anterior Spinal artery (2), joining its fellow of the opposite side to form a mesial vessel running down the anterior sui'face of the spiaal cord. These spinal arteries supply the cord, and anastomose with the rami spinales of the vertebral, intercostal, lumbar, and sacral arteries. 3. A small Posterior Meningeal artery (4) to the dui-a mater. 4. The Posterior In ferior Cerebellar artery (5), passing backward to the posterior part of the inferior surface of the cerebellum, and anastomosing with the other cerebellar arteries. The Branches of the Basilar Artery are :— 1. The Anterior Inferior Cerebellar arteries, a pair of small vessels passing to the anterior part of the inferior surface of the cerebellum on each side, and anastomosing with the other cerebellar arteries. 2. Transverse arteries of the Pons, foui- or five on each side, supplying the pons Varolii. 3. The Auditory artery, arising with the ti-ansverse arteries but accompanying the auditory nerve into the temporal bone. 4. The Superior Cerebellar arteries (7), arising close to the bifui'- cation, and separated from the posterior cerebral arteries by the third pair of nerves. Each ai-tery winds around the crus cerebri, parallel to the fourth nerve, to reach the upper surface of the cere- bellum, whore it anastomoses with its fellow and with the inferior cerebellar arteries. It supplies the cerebellum and sends twigs to the optic lol)es aiid choroid i^lexus. 5. The Posterior Cerebral arteries (8), are the teiminal branches of the basilar trunk. Each artery winds around the cms cerebri,620 DISSECTION OF THE BKAIN. parallel to the superior cerebellar artery but separated from it by the third nerve, and is distributed to the under surface of the posterior part of the cerebrum, where it anastomoses with the middle cerebral artery. It is connected to the internal carotid artery by the posterior communicating artery, shortly after its oiigin. Its branches may be divided into cortical and medullary. The cortical branches supply the internal and inferior part of the temporo-occi- pital region of the cerebrum, the temporo-sphenoidal and occipital convolutions, the cimeate lobule, and the dentate convolution; and the medullary branches {postero-meclian, postero-JateraJ, and posterinr choroid) are distributed to the optic thalamus, thu-d venti-icle, velum interpositum, and choroid plexus. The largest of these is the 2Wsterior choroid, which passes through the transverse fissure. The poste7-o-7nedian branches are several fine twigs which pierce the posterior perforated sjDot. The Internal Carotid Artery (Fig. 294, lo) has been ti-aced to the anterior clinoid ^jrocess of the sphenoid bone, where it was divided in removing the brain. The artery reaches the base of the brain on the outer side of the optic commissure, and at once breaks up into tliree branches—the anterior and middle cerebral, the jDosterior communicating, and the anterior choroid arteries. 1. The Anterior Cerebral artery (13) runs forward in the longitu- dinal fissure, and, tm-ning round the genu of the coi-pus callosiun, is distributed to the anterior part of the cerebrum, reaching as far back in the longitudinal fissure as the parieto-occipital sulcus. The arteries of the two sides are united at the commencement of the fissure by a short transverse branch, the anterior communicating artery (14). At its origin the anterior cerebral artery sends a few medullary branches {antero-median and antero-lateral) through the lamina cinerea and anterior perforated spot to the oth ventricle and front of the corpus striatimi; and its terminal cortical branches are distributed to the frontal, para-central, and parieto-occipital convo- lutions, and to the corpus callosum. The Anterior rommunicatim/ Artery gives off some ante7-o-median branches which pass through the lamina cinerea, with associated twigs from the middle cerebral. 2. The Middle Cerebral artery (12), a larger branch than the la.st, rvms in the fissiu-e of Sylvius between the frontal and temporo- sphenoidal lobes, and divides into four or five large cortical branches, which lie between the convolutions of the Island of Reil, and are distribvited to the island and to the frontal, temporo-sphenoidal and parietal convolutions. Medullary branches are given off before the division to supply the caudate and lenticular nuclei of the corpus striatum and the internal capsule; and some small twigs621 THE ARTERIES OF THE BRAIN, arising near its commencement run with companion branches from the anterior cerebral artery to pierce the locus perforatus antrcus on their way to the corpus striatum. 3.

The Circle of Willis (Fig. 294) is the name given to the com- munication between the arteries at the base of the brain, and may- be traced on either side from before backward as follows :—Anterior communicating, anterior cerebral, and internal carotid arteries; posterior communicating, posterior cerebral, and basilar arteries. This free anastomosis is of imjDortance in caiTj-ing on and equal- ising the cii-culation of the blood in the brain, when an obstruction arises in one of the main trunks. Various irregularities of the vessels forming the circle of Willis may be met with, one or other of the arteries being much above or below its normal size; but the direct communication between the trunks is almost constant. The Veins of the brain open into the sinuses of the skull, which have been examined {p. 369). The superior cerebral veins enter the superior longitudinal sinus ; the inferiur ctrehntJ enil in the inferior longitudinal, lateral, cavernous, superior petrosal and superior longitudinal siauses, and the venre Galeni; the superior ceri-beUar veins enter the vente Galeni; and the inferior cerebellar veins pass to the occipital or sigmoid sinus. The Base of tse Brain. [The arachjioid and pia mater are to be carefuUy dissected from the base of the brain, care being taken not to detach any of the nerves. It should be noticed that the pia mater disappears between the splemum of the corpus callosum and the mid-brain, at the commencement of the great transverse fissure of the brain (p. 647). The pia mater upon the cerebellum and posterior part of the cere- brum should be left undisturbed, so that the velum interpositimi may not be damaged.] The convolutions of the under siu-face of the great brain or Cere- brum are divided into an anterior and a posterior group by the Sylvian fissm-e. The anterior group, representing the under surface of the frontal lobe, is subdivided.into the straiyht and the supra-orbital rouvoln- tums by the olfactory sulcus, a straight fissure which riuis parallel to the longitudinal fissure. The straight conrolufiun lies on the inner side of the olfactory sidcus, and is continuous with the antero- infenor extremity of the marginal convolution of the mesial aspect of the brain. The supra-orbital convolutions lie over the orbital plate of the frontal bone, and are divided into anterior, posterior624 THE BASE OF THE BEAIN. and internal groups by a fissui-e, wMch breaks up into three or more branches, and is called the triradiaic aidrus. The ol/adorij sulcus lodges the olfactory peduncle and bulb. The Fissure of Sylvius appears on the base of the brain as a deep sulcus of curved form, between the supra-orbital convolutions and the upper surface of the tempore-sphenoidal lobe. Its opening [VuUeada Syhni) Hes on the Fig, 297. OPERC APS outer side of the anterior per- forated space and root of the olfactory nerve. From this poiiit it runs outwards to reach the lateral aspect of the hemisphere, where it ^VLll be traced fui-ther. The convolutions behind the fissm-e of Sylvius are called/e/;i- poro-dcd'pHal, and represent the under surface of the temporo- spbenoidal and occipital lobes. The posterior half of these con- volutions is concealed by the cerebellmn. The temporo-occipital region is divided by a lissm-e, the cul- luteral sulcus, into internal and external temporo-occipital con- volutions, the foi-mer of which is better known as the unci»ate ;,!,r., on account of the hook-Hke ciu-vattu-e of its anterior extremity, or as the Mppocarapal gyrus from its connexion with the hippocampus ™The Uncinate or Hippocampal gyrus is closely related to the cru. cerebri and the fourth nerve. The fissure which separates it from the crus will afterwards be traced into the ti-ansverse and dentate fissures. It is divided posteriorly into two limbs by the mtrusion of a fissure, the calamne : the upper limb becoimng continuous with the formca,te convolution around the splenium of the corpus cal- losum, while the lower limb is continued back beneath the calcanne Fig. 297.-OrbitalBm-face of the Frontal lobe and Island of ^^^^^^^^ ^ The tip of the tempoi-o-sphenoidal lobe is removed.

The hvol-, or uncus, is situated at its anterior extremity in contact with the side of the cms cerebri, and is crossed by a delicate greyish band, the hand of Giaconiini, continuous with the dentate convolution. The Collateral sulcus is of considerable depth, and leads to the foi-mation of a longitudiaal ridge, the eminentia collateralis, in the middle horn of the lateral ventiicle. The Dentate or Hippocampal fissure and convolution may be exposed by separating the uncinate gyrus from the crus cerebri. The convolution, as will be shown, is really formed by the free border of the grey matter of the uncinate convolution. It will be most convenient to examine the several sti-uctures found on the base of the brain in front of the pons Varolii, first in the median line and afterwards on each side. In the median line fi'om before backwards are—(1) the longitudinal fissure; (2) the lamina cinerea; (3) the oijtic commissure; (4) the tuber cinereum (with the infundibulum and pituitary body); (5) the corpora albicantia ; (6) the locus perforatus posticus. On each side from before backwards are—(I) the under surface of the frontal lobe of the cerebrum, with (2) the olfactory bulb and its peduncle resting in the olfactory sulcus; (3) the optic nerve (in front of the commissure), and (4) the optic tract (behind the commissure); (5) the locus perforatus anticus, at the root of the olfactory nerve and close to the commencement of (6) the fissui-e of Sylvius; (7) the crus cerebri diverging fi-om its fellow, with the commencement of the transverse fissure to its outer side; (8) the third nerve, appearing between the divergent crura; (9) the foiu'th nerve winding roimd the outer side of the crus; (10) the temporo- occipital convolutions. The Longitudinal Fissure (Fig. 298, i) divides the cerebrum into the two hemispheres. The portion now seen separates the fi'ontal lobes of the cerebrmn, and, if these are drawn apart, a white body, the corpiis callusum, will be seen at the bottom of the fissure. The anterior part of the corpus callosum, aroimd which the anterior cerebral artery turns, is known as the (/enu, and the portion contiiuied backwards and downwards from tliis into the lamina cinerea is teraied the rostrum. The Lamina Cinerea (Fig. 298, 4) is a thin grey layer, con- tinuous superficially with the rostrum of the corpus callosmn and prolonged to the margin of the optic commissure, and above that to s s626 THE BASE OF THE BRAIN. the tuber cinereum. It is almost vertical in direction, and foims part of the anterior wall of the third ventricle. It is pierced by small anterior 'perforating twigs from the anterior cerebral and anterior communicating arteries. The Optic Commissure or Chiasma (Pig. 29S, 7) is the point of communication between the two optic nerves. The fibres are said to have the following arrangement:—The outermost fibres of the tract pass to the optic nerve of the same side ; the middle fibres mostly decussate with those of the opposite side, forming a figure of X, and pass to the optic nerve of the opposite side; the most posterior fibres are reflected back to the brain along the opposite optic tract behind the cross arrangement; and a few optic nerve fibres pass in the fi-ont part of the commissure fi-om one eye to the other. The Tuber Cinereum (Fig. 298, 8) is a rounded gi-ey lamina, forming part of the floor of the thii-d ventricle. It is placed imme- diately behind the optic chiasma, and is continuous with the lamma cinerea over the dorsal aspect of the commissure. Projecting from it is the Infundibulum, a hoUow, funnel shaped process, attached by its narrow extremity to the pituitary body below, and communicatmg by its cavity with the third ventricle above. The Pituitary hudy is usually torn off in the removal of the brain and left m the Sella Turcica. In the foetus it is hoUow ; in the adult it will be seen (il left attached to the bram) to be soHd and to consist of two lobes of a reddish colour: an anterior larger,and oblong in shape; a posteiior lobe small and rounded. These are of different morphological sigmfi- cance; the anterior lobe being developed from the epiblast of the upper end of the primitive buccal cavity ; while the posterior lobe originates, with the infundibulum, as a hollow process fi-om the anterior cerebral vesicle, but in the higher vertebrates degenerates into a solid mass of connective tissue with scattered cells and pigmented corpuscles. , , ^ i. 1 The relation of the infundibulum and pituitary body to the tuber •cinereum wiU be better understood by refening to the vertical section of the brain (Fig. 310, 20). The Corpora Albicantia or Mammillaria (Fig. 29b, 10) are two white bodies resembling small peas, which are placed between the two crm-a cerebri and immediately behind the tuber cinereuni They are formed by the anterior crura of the fornix which, as wU be afterwards seen, descend to the base of the bram and there twist upon themselves, the points of reflection appearing at the siu ace on each side of the middle line. Upon section grey matter will be found in the interior of each mammiUaiy body.THE LOCUS PERFORATUS ANTJCUS. 627 ^ The liocus Perforatus Posticus (Fig. 298, 12) is placed behind the corpora albicantia in the angle between the two crui-a cerebri. It is composed of grey matter, and is perforated by numerous small vessels going to the thalamus opticus fi'om the posterior cerebral artery. The several structm-es which have been enumerated in the median line, viz., lamina cinerea, optic chiasma, tuber cinereum, corpora albicantia, and locus perforatus posticus, are all included within the area of the circle of WiUis, and also form parts of the anterior wall and floor of the third ventricle of the brain (see vertical section Fig. 310). The Interpednnnilar spare is the lozenge-shaped interval between the optic commissure and tracts in front, and the crura cerebri and pons Varolii behind. It contains the tuber cinereum, the infimdi- bulum, the corpora albicantia, the posterior perforated spot, and the third pair of nerves. The Olfactory Peduncle (First nerve) (Fig. 298, 3) is of a prismatic shape, very soft, being destitute of neurilemma, and held m its place only by a reflection of the arachnoid. It has three roots, two white and one grey. The external root (wliite) passes in front of the anterior perforated space to the fissure of Sylvius, and may be traced to the corpus striatum; the internal root (white) goes to the inner side of the fi-ontal lobe; the middle root (gi-ej^) passes to the papilla of grey matter in the olfactory sulcus. The Olfactory Bulb (Fig. 298, 3) is a small lobe of grey matter formed upon the extremity of the olfactory peduncle, and fi-om it arise the branches of the olfactory nerve, which descend to the nose. It is oval in shape, and rests upon the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone. The Optic or Second Nerve (Fig. 298, 7) pa.sses fi-om the optic commissure to the eye-ball, where it is lost in the retina It is round and firm, and is invested by a sheath composed of dura mater, arachnoid and pia mater. It has been shown that each optic nerve has fibres derived from the opposite as well as from the coiTesponding eye and side of the brain, and others connecting it with its follow. ^ Thf- Optic Tract (Fig. 298) is a flattened band connecting the optic commissure with the brain. It can be seen passing around the crus cerebri to disappear beneath the imcinate gyrus and will be afterwards traced to the corpora, fjenim/nta, to the optic 'thalamus and to the corpora ipiadru/cinina. ■ ' W ^l^^rTp ^f'^^""^^"^ (Fig. 298, 6) is situated close behind the olfactory nerve, and at the inner end of the fissm-o of ss 2628 THE BASE OF THE BRAIN.

It corresponds to the margin of the lesser wing of the sphenoid bone when the brain is in sitn, and on the outer aspect of the brain divides into two branches, which will be subsequently ti-aced. The Island of Reil, Insula, or Central Lobe (Fig. 297), is a ■ group of five convolutions {(jyri operti) radiating fi-om a point a little external to the anterior perforated spot, and bounded by unterior, posterior and external limitimj sulci. It is exposed by opening up widely the basal portion of the fissure of Sylvius, and its two posterior gyri are then seen to be continuous internally with the temporo-occipital convolutions. In frontal section (Fig. 306) the insula wiU be seen to be closely related to the corpus striatum, and its siUci lodge the main branches of the middle cerebral artery, from which the lenticulo-striate vessels arise. The Crura Cerebri (Fig. 298, 14) (peduncles of the cerebrum) are two large white bodies, which appear at the anterior border of the pons Varolii and diverge to enter the under siu-face of the cerebrum. They are mainly fonned by the columns of the medulla and spinal cord transmitted thi-ough the pons VaroHi. Each crus IS suiToimded and overlapped externally by the gyrus uncinatus, and crossed by the optic tract and fourth nerve, and is closely related to the free border of the tentorium cerebelli. Its inferior aspect is coarsely stiiated by fibres from the anterior pyramid of the medulla oblongata, and is known as the crusta, while the deeper fibres, called the tegmentum, enclose a pigmented gi-oup of ganglionic ceUs, the locus niyer. The crui-a with the corpora quadrigemina constitute the mid-hvuin. The Third Nerve (Fig. 298, g) (motor oculi) appears with its fellow between the crvu'a cerebri in front of the pons Varolii. The fibi-es are connected with the grey substance of the crus (locus niger), and may be traced to the anterior wall of the aqueduct of Sylvius. _ The Fourth Nerve (Fig. 298, ii) (trochlearis vel patheticus) IS the smallest of the cranial nerves, and winds round the outer side of the crus cerebri. It wiU be afterwards traced to the valve of Vieussens and to the anterior wall of the aqueduct of Sylvius below the third. The Pons Varolii or Tuber Annulare (Fig. 298, 16, and Fig. 312) is the large white body immediately behind the crura and in front of the medulla oblongata. It is more <n- less convex from side to side, but is slightly grooved along the midcUe Hue by the basilar artery. Its transverse fibres are prolonged on each side as630 THE BASE OF THE BRAIN. a round tMck process of white fibres, passing obliquely outwards aud backwards to the cerebellum, and forming the middle cerebeUur peduncle or pi'ocessus a cerebello ad jxmtem. Its longitudinal fibres, divided into two parts by a deep bundle of transverse fibres, pass from the medulla through the crura to the cerebral hemispheres. Emerging from the side of the pons is seen the fifth nerve. The Fifth Nerve (Fig. 298, 13) (trifacial, trigeminal) is the largest of the cranial nerves, and consists of two portions, motor and sensory, of which the motor is the anterior and smaller. The nerves arises from the side of the pons Varolii, a few fibres of the pons intervening between the two roots; but its deep origin will be traced to the floor of the fourth ventricle. The Sixth Nerve (Fig. 298, 15) (abducens oculi) arises from the anterior pyramid of the medulla oblongata close to the posterior border of the pons, and slightly from the pons itself. It may be traced deeply to a nucleus in the floor of the foui-th ventricle. The Medulla Oblongata (Fig. 298) is the upper part of the spinal cord, and extends from the lower border of the foramen magnum to the lower border of the pons. It is about an inch in length, larger above than below, somewhat flattened from before backwards, and runs almostverticaUydownwards, with a slight inch- nation backwards, resting upon the basilar groove of the occipital bone ; but when the brain is removed the medulla often assumes an almost horizontal direction, and errors of nomenclatrrre have arisen from this change of position. It contains all the elements of the spinal cord, continued through it to the cerebrum and cerebellum, and has, in addition, a special ganglionic structui-e, the olivary body, and a number of grey nuclei for the origin of nerves. The anterior aspect of the medulla is all that can be seeu at thi.< stage of the dissection. It is divided into two halves by the (interior 'median fissure. This fissure is continuous below with the anterior median fissm-e of the cord; it terminates above in a small depression called the foramen caciim, and is partially obliterated below by the decussation of the crossed pyramidal tracts. On either side of the fissure is the rounded anterior pyramid, continuous with the anterior column and the opposite lateral column of the cord. Its fibres pass through the pons Varolii, between the superficial and deep transverse fibres, to form the crusta of th.' crus. Tho Olire or Olivari/ hody (22) is an ovoid projection, on tli.^ outer side of the anterior pyramid and immediately below the pon^. It is separated fi-om the anterior pyramid by the hypoglossal siUcn^631 THE CRANIAL NERVES. or anterior lateral furrow, and the emerging filaments of the twelfth nerve; and from the funiculus of Eolando by a posterior lateral furrow pierced by fibres of the ninth, tenth and eleventh nerves. On section it will be found to contain a plicated capsiile of grey matter, open above, and giving origin by its inner sui'face to a bundle of fibres that join those sm'rounding the capsule, and derived from the lateral column of the cord. Some white fibres of deep origin, the superficial arciform fibres, are seen arching below and over the olivary body. The Funiculus of Rolando is continuous superficially with the lateral column of the spinal cord, but corresponds to a mass of grey matter [suhstantia gdatinosa of Rolando) continuous with the head of the posterior horn of grey matter of the cord. At the lower part of the medulla it is broad, and lies between the anterior pyramid and the restiform body, but at the upper part it is narrowed and pushed aside by the projection of the olivary body between it and the anterior pyramid. It may be traced as a slight prominence outside the olive, and a few longitudinal fibres may sometimes be seen in front of this body. The funiculus gracilis and fimiculus cmieatus of the medulla, continued upwards from the posterior median and postero-lateral columns of the cord, will be seen later. The Seventli and Eighth Nerves (Fig. 298) (Facial and Auditory), are closelj- connected at their origins, the facial being anterior and the auditory posterior; and running between the two is a minute nerve called the jiars intermedia, which is connected with the glosso-pharyngeal nucleus. The Facial (17) is rounder and smaller than the auditory; it arises from the lateral tract of the medulla oblongata, between the olive and restiform body, and slightly from the pons Varolii. The deep origin can be traced to the floor of the foiirth ventricle. The Auditory (ig) is flattened and very soft, owing to the absence of neurilemma. It Lies in close contact with the last, and arises partly fi'om two nuclei in the lower part of the floor of the foui'th ventricle, partly from a nucleus in the restifonn body, and derives a few fibres from the striae acousticas. The Ninth, Tenth and Eleventh Nerves (Glosso-pharjTigeal, Pneumo-gastric, and Spinal-accessory) (Fig. 29cS) lie close together in that order from above downwards, and spring from the side of the medulla between the olivary body and funiculus of Rolando. The aiosso-pliari/iKjeal nerve (21) is the smallest of the thi'ee nerves, and arises by five or six roots below the eighth nerve. The rneumo-gaatric or Vayua nerve (23) arises below theTHE EXTERIOR OF THE BRAIN. 632 glosso-phaiyngeal, by a number of fibrillse which unite to fonn a single nerve. This lies parallel to the glosso-pharyngeal nei-ve and to the inner side of a small lobe of the cerebellum, called the flocculus or lube of the pneumo-gastric. The Spinal-accessory nerve (25) springs partly from the medulla and partly from the spinal cord. The upper part (accessory to the vagus) arises by fine fibrillse, below the origin of the pneumo- gasti'ic, for the whole length of the medulla. The spinal portion (Fig. 290, g) originates in a similar way from the side of the spinal cord, between the ligamentum denticulatum and the posterior roots of the spinal nerves, reaching as low as the sixth cervical nerve. The deep origins of the ninth, tenth and eleventh nerves may be traced to sjiecial nuclei in the lower part of the floor of the fourth ventricle. The spinal fibres of the eleventh are connected with the grey matter of the spinal cord. The Twelfth, or Hypoglossal Nerve (Fig. 298, 27) arises super- ficiallj'^ by numerous fibrillBe from the groove between the anterior pyramid and the olivary body. The nerve roots unite into two bundles, which pierce the dura mater separatelj'. The deep fibres may be traced to a special nucleus at the lower jiart of the foirrth ventricle. [By slicing down the pons Varolii, the arrangement of its trans- verse and longitudinal fibres may be seen. These are in alternate layers, the transverse being continuous with the crui'a cerebelli, and the longitudinal with the fibres of the cord and the ciirra cerebri. The superficial fibres are transverse, beneath these is a longitudinal layer which is succeeded bj^ a deep layer of transverse and a still deeper layer of longitudinal fibres. The longitudinal fibres are continued up into the cius cerebri on each side ; and, on making a deep long cut into this stmctiu-e, it will be seen that a grey nucleus of dark colour, the locus niger, occupies the interval between the superficial and deep fibres. The posterior aspect of the j)ons and medulla forms the anterior wall of the fourth ventricle.] The Exterior of the Brain. [The brain being placer! with the base downwards, the pia mater is to be removed from the upper siu-face of the cerebriim.] The exterior of each hemisphere of the brain has thi-ee sui-faces, Calvarial, Basal and Mesial. It is subdivided by fissm-es of varying depth into prominences called convolutions, and these are grouped by natural and arbitrary boundary lines into lobes, lobidcs and regions. The convolutions and fissures vary considerably inTHE FRONTAL LOBE. 633 I different brains and even on different sides of the same brain, bnt within certain limits their arrangement is fairly constant. The ]}u8al surfuce has already been described (p. 623). ■ The (Jalvarial surface (Figs. 299 and 300), moulded to the form of the inner surface of the vault of the cranium, is subdivided by means of three important fissiu-es, the fissure of Sylvius, the tissui-e of Eolando, and the external Parieto-occipital tissui-e, into foiu- lobes, frontal, parietal, temporo-sjjhenoidal and occipital. A fifth lobe, the Central lobe or Island of Eeil, is concealed at the bottom of the fissm-e of Sylvius (p. 629). The Fissure of Sylvius, the commencement of which was seen on the basal sm-face, winds on to the calvarial sm-face, and rimning obhquely upwards and backwards, divides after a short course into two branches, the uuterior or vertical, which ascends for a short distance into the inferior convolution of the frontal lobe; and the pusteriur or horizontal, which continues the dii-ection of the main fissure backwards and upwards for about three inches, and then usuaUy turns somewhat abruptly upwards for about aninch^ termi- natmg m the supra-marginal fissui-e of the parietal lobe. The point at which its course is changed is called the aiigfe. The Fissure of Rolando or Central fissure commences above close to the longitudinal fissui-e, about half an inch behind the central pomt of this, and runs downwards and forwai-ds ia a sinuous course at an angle of about 65° with the longitudinal fissm-e, to end a little above the posterior branch of the fissure of Sylvius, and about an mch behind the anterior limb of the same fissui-e. The External parieto-occixjital fissure is continuous with the Inter- nal purieto-onipital fissure, which will be found on the mesial surface of the hemisphere. It runs outwards and forwards for about an inch, starting fi'om the longitudinal fissm-e about midway between the upper end of the fissm-e of Eolando and the hinder extremity of the brain, and ends above the first annectaut gyrus between the supra-paiietal lobule and the superior occipital convolution. The outer surface of the Frontal lobe is boimded by the longitu- dinal fissure above; by the junction of the calvarial and basal surfaces, and by the anterior part of the Sylvian fissure below • and by the fissure of Eolando behind. It is subcHvided into four'con- volutions by thi-ee secondary sulci, superior, inferior and precentral The precentral sulcus runs parallel to the fissure of Eolando, and between the two lies the ascending frontal con mlntiou. The superior sulcus runs more or less paraUol to the longitudinal fissm-e and joins the precentral sulcus postcriorfy: it separates the superior orTHE EXTERIOR OF THE BRAIN. 634 first from the middle or second frontal couvolution. The inferior sulcus, often difficult to localise, lies about midway between the superior fissure and the lower border of the lobe, ending in or near PiK. 299. Sap.Tcnvp the precentral sulcus, and separates the middle fi-om the inferior or third frontal couvolution. _ . The Inferior frontal convolution describes a ciu-ve at its posterior part around the anterior limb of the fissui-e of Sylvius.

Its internal surface is represented by the quadrate lobule on the mesial surface of the hemisphere. Its external surface is subdivided by two sulci, the intra-paiietal aud the superior post-central, into three segments, the ascending parietal convolution, the supra-parietal lobule, and the infra- parietal lobule. The Intra-jmrietal sulcus commences above the posterior limb of the fissm-e of Sylvius, and runs upwards parallel to the lower part of the Eolandic fissure {{lars ascendms inferior or inferior post-central), then bends backwards and courses in a dii-ection nearly parallel to the longitudinal fissirre into the occipital lobe, between the first and second annectant convolutions Q-ars Jiorizontalis). The Superior Post-central sulcus may be regarded as a continua- tion upwards of the ascending portion of the last, but is often separated from it by a convolution, It runs parallel to the upper half of the Eolandic fissm-e nearly to the longitudinal fissure. The Asctndimj jiarietal convolutiuii is parallel to the ascending frontal convolution. It is bounded in fi-ont by the Eolandic fissui-e, and behind by the superior post-central sulcus and the ascending portion of the intra-parietal sulcus. The Huperior parietal convolution or Superior-parietal lobule lies above the longitudinal portion of the intra-paiietal sulcus, between the superior post-central and external parieto-occipital fissures. It is continuous below the latter with the first annectant convolu- tion, and at the longitudinal fissure with the quadiute lobule on the mesial surface of the hemisphere. The Inferior parietal lobule lies below the longitudinal portion of the intra-panetal sulcus, and behind its ascending portion. Three fisstu-es terminate m it below: the posterior branch of the fissure of Sylvius in front, the paratkl or superior temporo-sphiuoidal fissm-e in the middle, and the u,ferxor temporo occipital (2nd temporal) sulcus behind: and around each of these arches a convolution : the supra-marginal over the byivian fissure, the angular convolution over the parallel fissme anil the vost-parietal over the inferior temporo-occipital.

Its under surface is represented by portions of the gp'us uncinatus and external temporo-occipital convolutions (4th and oth temporal gyri) seen on the basal aspect of the hemisphere. Its outer surface is divided by two fissures, the superior or jMralhl, and the inferior, into three convolutions, superior, middle and inferior. The parallel fissure is parallel to the posterior branch of the Sylvian fissure, and ends in the angular convolution; the inferior fissure, parallel to the last, ends in the post-parietal gyrus. The superior and middle or first and second mnrohitions become continuous with the supra-marginal, angular and post-parietal gyri; the inferior or third convolution passes above the pre-occipital notch to the occipital lobe by means of a lateral annectant gyrus, and is continuous inferiorly with the external temporo-occipital convolution of the basal surface. The upper sui-face of this lobe is concealed within the fissure of Sylvius and closely related to the Island of Eeil. It presents two or thi-ee transverse temporal gyii, the largest and most anterior of which hes behind the posterior limiting sulcus of the insula. The Occipital Lobe lies behind the parietal and temporo- sphenoidal lobes. Its outer surface has been arbitrarily divided mto superior, middle and inferior convolutions by superior and inferior occipital fi.ssures, but these are almost impossible to recognise on most brains. The parieto-occipital sulcus has been seen to pass into the occipital lobe : it usually joins a transverse furrow, the anterior occipjital sulcus, and below and in front of the latter is aix oblique lateral occiptitcd sulcus. These divide the outer surface of the lobe into an anterior gyrus, between the anterior sulcus and the uptm-ned end of the lateral sulcus- and a posterior gyrus behind the uptui-ned end of the lateral sulcus (Schafer). The occipital annectant gyri are four in number. The first annectant gyrus unites the superior occipital convolution with the supra-parietal lobiole; the second, the middle occipital with the angular convolution. The third, the middle occipital with the lower part of the post-parietal convolution; and the fourth, the lower occipital with the lower temporo-sphenoidal. The name of opercuhi has been' applied to those parts of the interior frontal, ascending frontal, asconcUng parietal and superior temporo-spheiioidal convolutions, which form a kind of oner culum or lid over the fissure of Sylvius and conceal the IslandTHE MESIAL SURFACE OF THE BRAIN. 638 The Mesial Surface oe the Bhain. For pui-poses of description it will be convenient to classify the appearances presented on the mesial aspect of the brain into (I.) those structures which cross the middle plane and are divided in a sagittal section through the longitudinal fissure, and (11.) those which lie close to the Irae of section but are not divided. I. The sti-uctui-es cut through are as follows (Fig. 310) :— (1) The Corpus callosum, with its rostrum and genu in front, its spleniiun behind, and its body in the middle (p. 641). (2) The Fornix, connected behind and above with the corpus callosum, and arching downwards and forwards to form the corpora albicantia at the base. (3) The Septum Incidmn, including between its layers the Fifth ventricle, and connecting the under surface of the body of the corpus callosum with the upper surface of the rostrum and fornix. (4) The Velum interpnsitum, a fold of pia mater entering the brain at the transverse fissure of Bichat, below the coiims caUosiun (splenium) and fornix. (5) The basal structures forming the anterior wall and floor of the third ventricle, viz., the lamina cinerea, the ojMc cMasma, the tuher cinerenm, the infundihulum and the pituitari/ bodi/, the commissm-al fibres between the two corpora albicantia and adjacent parts of the anterior piUars of the fomLx, the posterior perforated spot, and the junction of the crura cerebri. .

(H) The pons Varolii, cerebeUum, and medulla oblongata, with the fourth ventricle, and the valve of Vieussens connecting the superior cerebellar peduncles. II The undivided bilateral stmctures seen on the mesial sm-iace consist of the convolutions and sulci in front of. beldnd and above he corpus callosum; and the optic thaUinii. forming the atei^ walls of the third ventricle. Below the third ventricle he the temporo-occipital convolutions, which belong to the basa surface and are best exposed after removal of the pons, cerebellum, and medulla by section of the crura cerebri (Fig. 301) The principal fissures of the mesial surface are three m number: (1) the calloso-mar.jinal, C2) the internal par,eto-ocapttal.THE MESIAL SURFACE OF THE BRATN. 639 and (3) the cakarine; and hj means of these the convolutions may be divided into four gi-oups, (1) the gyrus fornicatus, (2) the marginal convolutions, (3) the quadi'ate lobule, and (4) the cuneate lobule. The CaUoso-marijinal fissure commences a Little below the rostrum of the corpus callosum, and ciirves forwards around the genu and backwards above the body, finally running upwards opposite the splenium to the margin of the longitudinal fissiu'e.

The CaJcarine fissure itms from near the lower part of the hinder extremity of the hemisphere forwards to a point a Httle below the splenuim of the corpus caUosum, dividing the posterior extremity of the uncinate gp-us into two parts. It con-esponds to a proiec- tion called the hippocampus minor in the posterior horn of "the lateral venti'icle. The Internal Parieto-occipital fissure is continuous above with the external parieto-occipital fissiu-e of the calvarial sui-face, and Fig. 301.-The inner and under siirfaGe of a cerebral hemisphere showing the convohitiona and Hulci (modified after Thane).

The Marginal Couvo/utiuns lie between the calloso-marginal fissure and the margin of the longitudinal fissure. They are subdivided by many secondary fissures (the most constant of which, the sulcus marginalis, subdivides the middle of the gyrus into superior and inferior jDarts), and about an inch and a half of their posterior extremity, partly cut off by a vertical fissure, coitc- sponds to the ascending frontal and parietal gjTi of the outer surface, and is sometimes termed the paracentral lobule. The Gyrus formcatus (Convolution of the Corpus Callosum) arches around the rostrum, genu, body and splenium of the corpus caUosum, and is continuous behind with the quadrate lobule and the upper limb of the posterior end of the uncinate gyrus. It is separated from the marginal convolutions by the calloso-marginal fissure. This and the uncinate gyi'us together form, around the corpus callosum and crus cerebri, a kind of ellipse {limbic lobe), which is complete except at one point, opposite the anterior perforated spot. The Quadrate lobule, representing the inner surface of the parietal lobe, lies between the terminal portion of the calloso-marginal fissure and the internal parieto-occipital fissure, and is continuous below with the hinder part of the fornicate gyi'us. The Cuneate lobule is a wedge-shaped group of convolutions between the parieto-occipital and calcarine fissm-es. Thk Intekior of the Brain. [A slice of brain substance about an inch thick is to be taken from the top of the right hemisphere, the knife being camed through the calloso-margmal sulcus; the centriun ovale mmus will thus be exposed.] The name Cerium. Ovale is given to the white substance of the cerebrum as seen on horizontal sections at different levels. It appears as a white mass of somewhat oval shape surroimded by the plicated grey matter of the convolutions. It is dotted by mnmte red or dark points, the punda vascnlosa, corresponding to divided blood vessels. ^ TBy slicing off one hemisphere a little above the level of the fl poiDUs callofum, a side view of the upper part of the opposite ■ SShe^^wm be obtained, but the convolutions of the inner^ smTcS can be thus only very imperfectly obBervf • T^^^^ ™ of the upper parts of both hemispheres a little above the level ot the corpus callosum displays the centrum ovale majus.]THE LATERAL VENTRICLES. 641 The Corpus Oallosum (Fig. 301, c. c), the great transverse commissm-e of the brain, consists of fibres passing transversely from one hemisphere to the other, forming the floor of the middle jjortion of the longitudinal fissure, and the anterior wall and roof of the lateral ventricles. It is nearer the anterior than the posterior exti'emity of the brain, and is slightly arched from before back- wards. In a median sagittal section its anterior extremity will be seen to bend abruptlj^ backwards and downwards to the base of the brain, fonning the (jenu and rostrum, while posteriorly it ends in a thick free border, termed the splmhim, which forms the upper boundary of the transverse fissure of Bichat and lies in contact with the velum interpositum. Beneath, it is connected with the sqitumhiciduni, and fiu'ther back with the fornix (Fig. 310). The Rostrum has been seen to become continuous superficially at the base of the brain with the lamina cinerea, and to give oif two ■pvdunch's which extend outwards, one on each side, to the beginning of the Sj'lvian fissru-e. On the ujjper sm-face of the corpus callosum in the middle line is a mesial longitudinal furrow, the raphe, on either side of which are two white bands, the strku obtedcn or nerves of Lancisi, and outside these are other longitudinal lines {lateral stf iw), overlapi^ed by the gyrus fornicatus. The longitudinal elements are crossed by transverse markings called the lim-ce transversce, which indicate the coui-se of the fibres of the structiu-e. The anterior caUosal fibres cm-ve forwards on entering the hemispheres, the posterior back- wards {forceps major)i and the intermediate fibres {tapetum) pass directly outwards. The Corpus Callosum is about foiu- inches in length fi-ota splenium to genu, and extends to within an inch and a half of the anterior extremity of the brain, and two inches and a half of the posterior extremity. "The Lateral VfiNTRidtES. [To open the lateral ventricle iti each hernisphBre, the corpus callosiun is to be carefully cut through about half an inch from the middle line, until the delicate membrane {ependijma ventri- culorum) lining the ventricle is seen ; the handle of the scalpel shoiild then be used to reflect the brain substance and expose the cavity.] The Lateral Ventricle (Fig. 302) consists of a central cariti/ or bod//, and three cornua, anterior, posterior, and middle or descending. The Anterior cornu tm-ns forwards and outwards into the front of the hemisphere, and offers nothing of importance lor notice. TheTHE LATERAL VKNTRICLES. 642 Po'.terior c.orim ciu'ves backwards aiid then inwards iuto tlie Mnder part of the brain, and ijresents on its inner wall two ridge-like elevations, one, the forcrps major, due to a biindle of fibres con- tinuous with the splenium of the corpus callosum and cui-ving backwards into the occipital lobe; the other, called the luppocampus mi'))or or calcar avis (Pig. 303, 7), corresponding to the bottom of the calcarine fissui-e. The Middh liorn commences at the same point as the posterior horn, but tui-ns downwards behind and beneath the optic thalamus to reach the base of the hemisphere. It will be traced in a subsequent dissection. The Body of the ventricle is bounded superiorly by the corpus callosum, and its floor, which slopes downwards and forwards in front, is fonued by the following parts, from before backwards— 1. Corpus striatum ; 2. Tfenia semicii'cularis ; 3. Optic thalamiis; 4. Choroid plexus ; 0. Fornix. The lateral ventricles commuuicate with one another and with the third ventricle by means of the Foramen 0/ Monro, a Y'Shaped opening bounded anteriorly and superiorly by the anterior pillars of the fornix, and behind by the anterior extremity of the optic thalamus. The Corpus Striatum (Fig. 302, 3) or superior ganglion of the hemisphere appears as a grey pyriform body in the floor of the ventricle, its greater end being dii-ected forwards and its narrow extremity or tail backwards and outwards. When cut ti-ansversely it will be seen to consist of two grey portions, an intraventriculnr or caudate nuclnis correspondiog to the sui-face exposed on the floor of the ventricle, and a larger extraventricidar or lenticular nucleus which corresponds in position with the Island of Eeil. The two nuclei are separated by a layer of white substance, called the internal capsule, consisting of fibres prolonged fr-om the crus cerebri and, in their passage through the grej- nuclei, causing the striated appearance from which the name of the body is dei-ived. A thin layer of grey substance called the claustrum is found outside the lenticular nucleus, and is separated from it by a band of white fibres, called the external capstUe, which joins the internal capsule below the nucleus; and fi-om the grey matter of the Island of Eeil by a second and unnamed layer of white matter (Fig. 306). The two corpora striata are separated behind by the two optic thalanii. The Taenia Semicircularis or Stria terminalis (Fig. 302, 6) is a narrow band of white matter lying superficially between the corpus striatum and the optic thalamus ; it joins the iuitorior pillar of the fornix in front, and posteriorly it becomes lost in the nucleus aniygdalce in the descending horn of the ventricle. A vein (vena643 THE FORNIX. corporis striati) is often found beneath it, and one or two small tributaries of the choroid plexus usually cross its upper suii'ace. The Thalamus Opticus (Fig. 302, 7) is here seen as a white body, overlapped by the fornix and choroid plexus. At its anterior end is a prominence, called the anterior tubercle, corresponding to a grey nucleus; posteriorly it forms the anterior and superior boimdary of the descending horn, and is surrounded by the lateral portion of the gi-eat ti-ansverse fissui-e. It will be fm-ther exposed in a later dissection. The Choroid Plexus (Fig. 302, 8) is a vascular fi-inge lying upon the surface of the thalamus, and continued into the descending cornu of the lateral ventricle. It will subsequently be seen as the fiinged edge of a process of pia mater (velum interpositum), which enters at the transverse fissui'e and Ues beneath the fornix. By di-awing gently upon the choroid plexus of one side, it may be shown to be connected with that of the opposite side through the foramen of Monro (5) (p. 650). [To see the fornix thoroughly, the remnant of the coi-pus callosum m the middle line should be cut thi'ough transversely about its centre, and the posterior part is to be carefully dissected away fi'om the subjacent fornix.] The Fornix (Fig. 302, 10) is a thin white body, of triangular shape, placed in the middle line beneath the corpus callosum. It is narrow in fi-ont, and there divides into two anterior crura ov jjillars, which pass to the base of the brain and become twisted on themselves to foi-m the corpora aJhicantia (p. 626). Posteriorly it is incorporated with the splenium of the corpus callosum, and gives off on each side a posterior pillar, which passes into the descending horn, fusing . with the hippocampus major and ttenia hippocampi. The angle of divergence between these posterior piUars is occupied by the trans- verse fibres of the coii^us callosum, which give rise to the appear- ance called the lyra of the forn ix. Its superior surface is connected in the middle line with the septum lucidum, and forms on each side a part of the floor of the lateral ventricle : its inferior surface is separated from the thiixl ventricle and optic thalami by the velum interpositum; and its lateral borders are in contact with the choroid plexuses. The fissure on each side, between its anterior pillar and the anterior extremity of the optic thalamus, is converted by the lining membrane of the ventricle {epeadijiiM) into a serous canal, the foramen of Monro, which opens below into the third ventricle. The choroid plexus does not pass through this canal but outside it. TT 2644 THE LATERAL VENTRICLES. The lateral ventricles are separated from one another by the Septum Lucidum, a very thin double layer of cerebral matter, grey externally and white within, enclosing a shut sac called the fifth ventricle, and extending between the anterior part of the corpus callosum and the fornix. It is deeper in front than behind (Fig. 310, 6). The Fifth. Ventricle (Eig. 302, 2) can be shown by cutting through the septum lucidum with a pair of scissors close to the Fig. 302. remains of the corpus callosum. It lies between the two layers of the septum lucidiun, and is deepest in fi-out. In the foetus it formed a part of the great longitudinal fissui-e, but is subsequently cut off fi-om the fissure by the development of the corpus callosum. Fig. 302.—Lateral ventricles of 1.

[To see the descending cornii, the side of the bram should be freely cut away opposite the point at which the choroid plexus disappears. Tlio choroid plexus being taken as a guide, the horn can be opened along its side, and the cavity exposed by drawing the parts asunder.] The Descending or Middle Cornu (Fig. 303) takes a curved coui-se downward, behind and then beneath the optic thalamus. Its direction is at first slightly backwards and then outwards, downwards, forwards, and inwards; opening at the base of the dissected brain thi-ough the lateral part of the transverse fissure of Bichat between the gJTus uncinatus and crus cerebri (Fig. 298). It contains the following structures fi'om without inwards — (1) the eminentia col- lateralh; (2) the Miixiocampus major, terminating below and in front in the^jes hippocam-pi; (3) the fimbria OTUeitia hippocampi; (4) the dentate convolution; (5) the dentate fissure; (6) the grey matter of the upper sui'face of the uncinate gjTus; (7) the choroid plexus overlying the taenia hippocampi. In the recent state the termination of the cornu is closed by the ependyma lining the lateral ventricle and its extensions. The Eminentia Collatendis (Fig. 303, 5) is an elongated projection commencing at the junction between the descending and posterior cornua, and mnning downwards into the descending horn on the outer side of the hippocampus major. It corresponds to the Fig. 303.—Middle and posterior cornua of the lateral ventricle of brain (from Hirschfeld and Leveille). 1. Pes hippocampi. 2. Ttenia hippocampi. 3. Hippocampus major. 4.

The Erpporampus Major (Fig. 303, 3) is a prominent convex body corresponding to an unfolding of cerebral matter around the dentate fissure, and occupj'ing the whole length of the cornu. Its anteiior extremity is enlarged, lobulated, and marked with more or less distinct transverse grooves, and has received the name pes hippocampi (i) from its fancied resemblance to the foot of an animal. It has a thin layer of white fibres on the surface, but consists princiiDally of grey matter continuous with that of the uncinate gyrus, by the folding of which it is develojied (Fig. 304). At the anterior border of the hippocampus major is a thin band of white cerebral matter continuous with the posteiior pillar of the fornix, known as the Fimhria or Tmiia Hipporampii (Fig- 303, 2). By lifting this up with the handle of the scalpel and tiu'ning it aside, the dissector exposes the Dentate Convolution or Fa.scia Dentata, a border of grey matter which receives its name from the toothed aspect given to it by the jjassage of small vessels across it at regular intervals. This is the free edge of the uvrinate <iyrus. The Dentate Fissure lies between the dentate convolution and the upper surface of the imcinate convolution (Figs. 301, 304). The f'horoid Plexus of the descending cornu is continuous with the choroid plexus of the lateral ventricle, and is now seen to be connected with the border of the fold of pia mater which enters the brain through the transverse fissure of Bichat. [The fornix should be cut through opposite the foramen of Monro, and reflected with the handle of the scalpel. The trans- verse markings called the Lyra will then be seen between its posterior pillars; and the velum inteii30situm beneath will be brought into view. By carefuHj- scraping away the brain substance with the handle of the knife, the continuity of the velum interpositiun with the pia mater through the great trans- verse fissm-e may be easily demonstrated.] The Velum Interpositum (Fig. 305, 5) is a double fold of membrane of triangular fonn, inflected into the interior of the brain at the transverse fissui-e from the pia mater over the upper surface of the cerebellum and the occipito-temporal convolutions of the under surface of the cerebrum. Between its layers, near the middle line, are the two veins of Galen passing to the straight sinus, the veins of the corpus striatum, and the choroid branches of the cerebral arteries, which enter it laterally. Its upper siu-face is in cojitact with the corpus callosum and fornix; its under surface forms the roof of the third ventricle, and rests upon the optic647 THE GREAT TRANSVERSE FISSURE. thakmi laterally; its borders are fringed by the choroid plexuses of the lateral ventricles, and the choroid plexus of the third ventricle depends from its inferior surface. ^ The Great Transverse Fissure or Fissure of Bichat (Fig. 304) which is now opened, is the slit by which the velum Fig. 304.

The fissure is seen between the coiTpus oallosum and corpora quadri- eemina in the middle line, and curving on each side around the posterior extremity of the optic tlialamus to end opposite the crus cerebri, between the thalamus and the gyrus uncmatus.

The latter is very liable to be removed with the velum interpositum, unless it is carefully dissected.] The'Third Ventricle (Pig. 307) is the mesial interspace between the two optic thalami: these, with the peduncles of the pineal gland, foiining its lateral boundaries. Its roof is formed by the fornix and velum interpositum. Its floor corresponds to the optic Fig. 306.—Transverse vertical section of the cerebrum made immediately behind the corpora albicantia (H. E.

Its anterior houndary is formed by the anterior pillars of the fornix; the anterior commissure, crossing in front of these and visible in theii* angle of divergence; and the lamina cinerea. Posteriorly lie the posterior commissure, the pineal gland with its pedimcles, and the aqueduct of Sylvius. The Anterior commissure is a round bundle of white fibres which may be traced on either side into the temporo-sphenoidal lobe, and is joined in fi'ont by a commissm-al band between the two olfactory nerves. The Posterior commissure, also white, is a thinner band of fibres rimning transversely between the two optic thalami beneath the pineal body. Between the anterior and posterior commissures is seen the Middle or soft commissure, a flat grey band joining the two internal nuclei of the optic thalami. The third ventricle communicates with the two lateral ventricles by the foramen of Monro, and with the foui-th ventricle by the iter a tertio ad quartum ventricuJum or aqueduct of Sylvius, a narrow canal about half an inch in length, which passes beneath the pos- terior commissure, the pineal gland, and the corpora quadrigemina (Fig. 310, i6). The Thalamus Opticus (Fig. 307, 6) is now fuUy exposed as a large ovoid body, grey within, and covered by a thin layer of white matter {straiitm zonule) externally. It is placed behind and iatemal to the corpus striatum, and is continuous externally with the sub- stance of the hemisphere (Fig. 304). It forms part of the floor of the lateral ventricle, the external waU and roof of the descending horn of the same cavity, and the lateral wall of the third venti-icle. Its anterior extremity (in the lateral ventricle) presents a slight prominence, the anterior tubercle; its posterior extremity, within the lateral curve of the great ti-ansverse fissui-e, has another tubercular prominence, the indvinur or fosterior tubercle; its under sm-face partly rests upon the crus cerebri and the grey matter of the floor of the third ventricle, and is partly free, fonning the roof of the terminal portion of the middle horn. In the latter situation it has two projections, the external and internal yeuicnlate bodies, which he in contact with the upper surface of the uncinate gyrus, and are connected with the quadrigenunal bodies and optic tract. Its rela- tions to the anterior and middle commissiu-cs have been mentioned. A white band, the imieal stria, continuous witli the peduncle of the pineal gland, runs along the junction of its upper and inner sui-faces- By turning the brain on its side the optic tract may be readily traced to the under surface of the optic thalamus, and wiU be foundTHE THALAMUS OPTICUS. 651 to divide into two parts, whicli are connected with the external geniculate body and pnlvinar, and pass on to the superior quadri- geminal body. The principal grey nuclei of the optic thalamus are : (1) The nucleus of the anterior tubercle ; (2) The posterior external nucleus, Fig. 307. extending into the posterior tubercle; (3) The posterior internal nucleus; (4) The nucleus of the external geniculate bodj'. Three other layers of grey matter wiU be found m the subthalamic region. Fig. 307.—Third ventricle of brain (from Hirschfeld and Leveille). 1. Corpus striatum dissected. 2. Fifth ventricle. 3.

The Pineal Body (Fig. 307, lo) (couariiim) is a reddish gi'ey flattened conical body, lying between the anterior pair of the corpora qiiadrigemina (nates), and above the posterior commissure of the third ventricle. Its anterior part or base is connected with the margins of the optic thalami by two slender (uduriur 2>nluncles or hahence, and with the posterior commissure by two slender inferior peduncles. It receives a special investment fi-om the velum inter- positum. The triangular depression, between the anterior peduncle and the pulvinar, is called the trigmmm Itaheiinhe. A grej' mtcletis is found in the floor of this space. The Corpora Guadrigemina or Optic Lobes (Fig. 307, 12) are foiu* white prominences containing grey matter, i:)laced imme- diately behind the third ventricle. They have been named Nates and Testes, fi'om their fancied resemblance to those parts ; the superior being the nates and the inferior the testes. They are connected with the corpora geniculata by white bands or hrachia, the brachium fi-om the superior quadrigeminal body on each side passing to the external geniculate body and the optic ti-act, the brachimn from the inferior quadrigeminal body to the internal geniculate body. Two broad white bands, the superior jjeduncles of the cerebellum [processus a cereheUo ad testes), pass fi'om the cerebellum to the inferior quadrigeminal bodies (Fig. 308, 3), and are connected by a thin layer of white matter, the Valve of Vieussem (Fig. 307, 13, Kg. 310, 15), to which may be traced the fourth pair of nerves. A small band of white matter seen passing transversely inwards to the corpora quadrigemina on each side, beneath the superior peduncle of the cerebellum, is called the Fillet of Reil (Fig. 308, 2). It is a portion of a tract of ascending fibres passing from the nuclei of the opposite posterior columns of the medulla, to end in the corpora quadrigemina and base of the cerebrum. [Opportunity may now be taken to trace out the anterior com- missure of the third ventricle and the anterior pillar of the fornix, by carefully scraping away the corpus striatum of one side.] The Anterior ■pilla.r of the Fornix has been seen descending in front of the thu-d ventricle, and behind the anterior commissure, to reach the base of the brain, where it is twisted upon itself and forms the superficial white substance of the corpus albicans. At this point it is probably continuous with the bundle of Vicq d'Azyr, which ascends to become lost in the grey matter of the optic thalamus.THE CEKEBELLUM. 653 The Ceeebelltjm. The Cerebellum (Fig. 298, 28), or smaller braiii, lies beneath the posterior lobes of the cerebrum, and in the skull is separated from them by the tentorium cerebelli. It is of a darker colour than the cerebrimi, and its sm-face is divided by sulci into laminae instead of convolutions. It consists of two lateral hemispheres united by a median portion; and a horizontal fissure, which passes round the margin, divides the organ into an upper and a lower part. The Upper surface is flat, except in the middle, where there is a slight elevation called the superior vcrmiforvi process. A deep notch in the middle line in fi'ont lodges the corpora quadrige- mina, and a deeper notch or fuiTow behind receives the falx cerebelli. The sui'face presents a number of subdivisions. The jDarts of the superior vermiform process enumerated from before backwards are as follows :— (1) The liityulu, thi'ee or four cerebellar laminae prolonged over the valve of Vieussens; (2) the central lohe, at the fore part of the superior vermiform process; (3) the culmen monticuli; (4) the clivus monticuli; and (0) the folium cacuminis, a thin lamella boimding the horizontal fissure. On each side of the superior vermiform firocess are :—(1) The ala of the lobus centralis continued fi'om the central lobe ; (2) the lobus lunatus anterior continuous with the culmen monticuli; (3) the lobus lunatus posterior continuous with the clivus monticuli; (4) the postero-superior seniilunur lohe continuous with the folium caciuninis. The fissm'es separating these lobes from before back- wards are: — (1) the precentral; (2) the ^^o«<ce;/i?-«/! ; (3) the ■preclival; and (4) the postclival. The cerebellum is connected to the cerebrum and spinal cord by thi-ee peduncles or crm-a:—superior, middle and inferior. The sujierior can now be seen. The Bupen'or Peduncle (Eig. 308, 3) {jjrocessus a cerebello ad testem) is a broad flattened white band, which is connected below with the inferior vermifoi-m process, and passes upwards, forwards, and inwards to the con'csponding testis (inferior quadiigeminal bodj-). It fonns the superior lateral boundary of the foiu-th ventricle. The two processes are prolonged beneath the corpora quadrigemina to the optic thalami, their fibres decussating in their passage. The Valve of Vieussens (Fig. 307, 13) (Velum mcdullare unterius) is the thin layer of white nervous matter, stretched between the two superior peduncles of the cerebellum, and connected with the654 THE CEREBELLUM. lingula of tlie superior vermiform process. It is narrow in front, but broader behind, and bridges over the U2)per part of the cavitj' of the foui'th ventricle. The fourth pair of nerves aiise from the middle line of the valve close behind the corpora quadiigemina (Fig. 310,15), and a small mesial ridge, the frceindum, extends from its ajtex to the groove between the inferior quadrigeminal bodies. [The preparation is to be turned over for the examination of the remaining peduncles and of the under surface of the cerebellum.] The MidiJIc Peduncle (Fig. 308, 4) (processus a cerebeJIo ad lyoniem) has been already seen at the base of the brain. It is the largest of the three, and the fibres pass across from one hemisphere of the cere- bellum to the other constituting the transverse fibres of the pons Varolii, which have been ali'eady dissected (p. 629). The Inferior Peduncle (Fig. 308, 5) [jii'ocessvs a cerehcUo ad medtiUiiw) will be better seen when the foiuih ventricle is opened. The Inferior Surface (Fig. 309) of the cerebellum is divided into two hemispheres by a deep fissure, the valk'culu, at the bottom of which is the inferior vermiform iirocess.

It is closely Fig. 309. related to tbe roots of tbe seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth, and eleventh nerves. Tbe Inferior Verniiforni Process (Fig. 309) is divided into four portions. Mostly anteriorly is tbe NoduJe (6) which projects into the fourth ventricle; next is a narrow ridge called the Uvula (7), so called from its position between tbe two tonsils; this is succeeded by tbe Pyramid (9), and most posteriorly are a few ti'ansverse laminse, constituting tbe tuber valvulte. By turning aside or cutting away tbe amygdala, a layer of white matter will be brought into view extending from the flocculus on each side to the top of the nodule. This is tbe Velum medullare inferius (8). Fig. 309.—Under surface of cerebellum, the amygdalte having been removed (from Hirschfeld and Leveille). 1. Medulla oblongata. 2. Pons Varolii. 3.

The Fourth Ventricle (Fig. 308, 6) is a serous cavity situated between the pons Varolii and medulla oblongata in front, and the cerebellum behind. It is lozenge-shaped, and presents anterior and posterior walls, superior and inferior lateral boundaries, siiperior, inferior, and lateral angles. It commimicates with the third ven- ti'icle by the aqueduct of Sylvius above, with the central canal of the cord by the ventricle of Aranfius below, and with the subarachnoid space, by three apertures in the pia mater of its pos- terior wall, one in the middle, the foramen of Magendie, and one in each lateral recess. The anterior nutU ov floor (Fig. 311) is vertical. It is formed by the pos- terior sm-face of the pons Varolii and meduUa oblongata, and presents for notice the following pai-ts :—(1) The median furrow (f.sc), extending from the aqueduct of Sylvius to the ventricle of Arantius. On each side of this are (2) the fasciculits teres (ft.), an eminence consisting of white fibres prolonged from the cord to the crus cerebri; (3) Strice. acoiisticw [a.st.), white bands of origiu of the auditory nerve crossing the fasciculus ti'ansversely; (4) The superior fovea (f.s.), a smaU longitudinal furrow external to the fasciculus and above the strise acoustical; (5) The inferi(yr fovea [f.i.), a fiu-row shaped like an inverted V, separating the lower part of the fasciculus internally fi-om (6) the ala cinerea (a.c.), a little grey Fig. 311.—Diagi-am Rhowing the position of the nerve nuclei near the floor of the fourth ventricle (after Thane). c.q.

The Mtdnlhi oblongata may now be seen in its whole extent. Its anterior aspect has been already described (page 630). The parts for notice on each side, enumerated from before backwards from the anterior median iissm-e, are (1) the anterior pyi'amid, (2) the hypo- glossal fuiTOw with the 12th nerve, (3) the olivary body, (4) the 9th, 10th, and 11th nerves, (5) tlie funiculus of Rolando with the substantia gelatinosa, (6) the funiculus cuneatus containing the nucleus cimeatus, (7) the funiculus gracilis containing the nucleus gracilis and enlarging above into the cl.ava, (8) the posterior median fissure, opening up into the foiu'th venti-icle by the separation of the fimicuU gi-aciles. Some fibres {superficial arcuate), emerging from the anterior median fissure, are seen to run upwards and backwards on each side over the anterior pyramid and olivary body to the posterior surface of the medulla, joining with the Eolandic and cimeate funiculi to form the rest/form body or inferior 'peduncle of the r.erehellum. When possible, as soon as the student has finished the above dis- section, he should procure another brain in order that he may make various sections of it, and so more thoroughly understand the rela- tions of the several parts. The most useful sagittal section is made in the median plane (Pig. 310), and one half of the brain may be reserved for fi'ontal sections like those represented in Figs. 304 and 306.PART VIII. DISSECTION OF THE EYE. In order to study the general anatomy of the globe of tlie eye it will be best to procure bullock's eyes, as it is difficult to obtain the human eye in a sufficiently recent condition. It must be borne in mind however that the eye of the bullock differs from that of man not only in its larger size but in the following particulars: the cornea is oval instead of being nearly cu'cular; the pupil is elongated into a slit instead of being a circular apertiu'e; the choroid coat presents the peculiar coloui-ed appearance known as the tapetum lucidum, which is absent in man; and the yellow spot which is present in the hiunan retina is wantmg in the eye of quadi'uped>. The following description is of the human eye. [All the fat and the remnants of the muscles of the eye are to be removed with scissors, the optic nerve being carefully preserved.] The Human Eyeball (Fig. 315) is nearly globular in shape. The posterior five-sixths (sclerotic segment) consists of the greater part of a sphere with a radius of about half an inch; the anterior sixth (corneal segment) is formed by a portion of a smaller sphere having a radius of a little less than a thii'd of an ijich. Hence the antero-posterior diameter is greater than the transverse diameter. The Sclerotic (Fig. 315, ii) or external timic, constituting the framework of the larger posterior segment, is composed of dense white fibrous tissue, which serves to maintain the shape of the eyeball and to protect the internal parts. It is thicker behind than in fi'ont, and is perforated behind by the optic nerve, a little to the inner side of the axis of the globe. The opening for the optic nerve is funnel-shaped, and bridged across by a layer of fibrous tissue, the himina cribrusa, which is pierced by nimierous apertures for the fibrils of the nerve, and a central orifice for the artcria rrntmlis retina: The sclerotic is also penetrated at various pomts by the ciliary vessels and nervesaround the optic nerve entrance by the long and short ciliary arteries and nerves ; near the corneal663 THE CORNEA. margin by the anterior ciHary arteries; and near the equator, by the vente vorticosje. In front it gives insertion to the recti muscles, from which it receives an expansion, and anteriorly to this point the conjunctiva is reflected upon its sm-face, but can be readily stripped np as far forwards as the margin of the cornea. The eyeball behind the corneal margin is surrounded by the Capsule of Tenon (see p. 394). The sclerotic overlaps the margin of the cornea, especially above and below. The tissue of the two structui-es is continuous. Fig. 315. The Cornea (Fig. 315, i) is one of the transparent media of the eye. In man it is perfectly circular when seen from within, but appears wider in the transverse direction if looked at from without, on account of the greater overlapping by the opaque sclerotic above and below. The cm-vature of the cornea varies in different individuals, but the anterior and posterior surfaces are always parallel. Its struc- tural elements are divisible into five layers : 1, anterior epithelium (conjunctiva cornese); 2, anterior elastic lamina; 3, cornea proper; Fig. 315.—Longitudinal section of the eye (drawn by H. Power). Ciliary body and process. Ciliary muscle. Retina. Ciliary zone. Sclerotic. Cornea. Iris. Anterior chamber commimicatuig with the posterior chamber through the pupil.

The cornea in health is a non- vascular structure, and its uouiishment is derived from the sur- rounding vessels; but it is traversed by a multitude of dehcate branches of the ciliary nerves, some of which may be traced into the anterior e25ithelium. By squeezing the eyeball between the finger and thumb the cornea will be rendered white and opaque, but resumes its fonner appearance when the pressm-e is relaxed. [Holding the eye lightly with the left hand, the scalpel is to be thrust thi-ough the margili of the cornea into the anterior chamber, when the aqueous humour will necessarily escape. With scissors the cornea may then be removed entii-ely.] The Anterior Chamber (Fig. 315, 3) is the space between the cornea and the iiis. It commimicates with the posterior chamber through the pupil, and is filled with the aqueous humour. The Iris (Fig. 315, 2) is the vascular contractile curtaia which sejjarates the anterior from the posterior chamber. It is composed of unstriped circular and radiating muscular fibres, blood-vessels, and pigment, and may be regarded as a prolongation of the choroid coat. In man, the pigment is of various colours. It is contained partly in cells dispersed through the tissue, and partly in a multiple layer of cells called the Uvea, which covers the posterior suj'face of the iris, and is continuous with the pigment of the ciliary jjrocesses. The Pupil is a circrdar opening (in man) in the centre of the iris, and varies in size according to the degree of the contraction of the annular muscular fibres imder the influence of light or dui'ing con- vergence of the eyes. The Posterior Chamber, lying behind the iiis, is little more than a virtual space, since the iris is visually in contact with the front of the lens. [In order to see the choroid coat entu'e, a fi-esh eye should be taken. A puncture having been made through the sclerotic, about its middle, a blowpipe is to be introduced, and air forced between the sclerotic and choroid coats, which will thus bo separated from one another. The sclerotic may then be divided aroimd the equator of the globe, and the posterior cup-likc portion being left as a support to the eye, the anterior part (with the cornea) is to be carefully detached from the choroid. In order to do this it will b(> necessary to scrape the interior of the sclerotic with the handle ot the scaljiel near its junction with the cornea, so as to tear throxigh the ciliary muscle which attaches the choroid and iiis to the sclerotic coat.]665 THE CHOROID COAT. The Choroid Coat (Fig. 316, 3) is a vascular pigmented mem- brane, expanded over the whole of the posterior portion of the globe of the eye, and continuous in front with the ciliary processes and ii-is. It is pierced by the optic nerve, and at this point is closely connected to the sclerotic; is loosely attached to the inner sua-face of that coat by a delicate connective tissue, called the membrana ftisca. Between the choroid and sclerotic may be seen the two long ciUari] arteries, passing to join the anterior ciliary arteries in Fig. 316. forming the great arterial cii'cle of the iris, and the long and short ciUary nerves running forwards to the ciliary processes and iris. The outer surface of the choroid presents the casa vorticosa, con- verging to foim trunks which pierce the sclerotic between the recti and a little behind the equator of the globe. Within this venous layer is the tunica Rmjschiana or chorio-cupiUuris, a jjlexus of capillaries formed by the breaking up of the short ciliary arteries, which have been seen to pierce the back of the sclerotic near the optic nerve. The dark pigment of the choroid is interspersed Fig. 316.—The choroid coat and the distribution of the vasa vorticosa (from Wilson, after Arnold). 1. Part of the sclerotic coat. 2. Optic nerve. 3. 3.

SiuToiinding the ii'is is the annular Ciliary Muscle (Fig. 315, 8), composed of imstriped fibre and having a grey ajjjjearance. The muscle lies beneath the ciliary processes and is connected anteriorly with the sclerotic coat, close to its junction with the cornea. It consists of both radiating and circular fibres. The radial fibres arise fi'om the junction of the cornea and sclerotic, and from the marginal fibres of the membrane of Descemet around an annular Fig. 317. sinus called the canal of Schlemm (Fig. 315, 5); and spread out to become attached to the outer surface of the ciliary processes, as far back as the anterior limit of the choroid at the ora serrata. The circular fibres form a ring around the margin of the lens. It is doubtful whether these are not continuous with the radial fibres (Fig. 317). The mode of action of the ciliary muscle is still imcertain. There is no doubt that it is the chief or sole agent in effecting the accom- modation of the lens to near vision, and it is usually behoved that by drawing forward the suspensory hgament, with the posterior part of the ciliary processes, it lessens the tension upon the elastic lens substance, and so allows that body to become more convex. It is however possible that the circular fibres may aid this effect by directly compressing the margin of the lens. I Fig. 317.—Section of ciliary muscle (after Jevans) fibres of the ciliary a.

[In order to see the cHiary body and processes a third eye sWd be divided cii-cularly thi-ough tbe sclerotic and choroid coats, with- otitdlmaging. the vitreous Worn-; the vitreous hiunom- and lens a " then to %e carefully separated from the anterior part of the Jhoroid, the ciHary prLsfes being detached ^o^^f ^,^0°;^ membrane, upon which they will leave a cu-cle marked with moie or less pigment (cii-cle of Zinn). The cihary processes and ms are now seen from behind.] The Ciliary Processes (Fig. 318, 4) are vascular fringes, which resemble a series of minute convergent conical ridges, formmg a rin" posterior to the iris and continuous behind with the choroid, the°point of junction with the latter being indicated by a festooned Fig. 318. / line, the ora serrata. They are covered with a thick layer of pig- ment cells (deficient, however, over the most prominent part of the larger cones), continuous with the uvea of the iiis in front, and with the pigmental layer of the retina behind. Each cone represents a vascular glomerulus. Between the anterior margin of the sclerotic and the ciliary body is a venous canal, which runs round the entire circumference of the eye and is called the Canal of Bchlcmm or sinus circulus iridis (Fig. 315, 5). [The lens will be seen on the posterior half of this section, or may be shown on the first eye by carefully removing the iris.]. Fig. 318.—Anterior half of the eye, seen from within (from Wilson), 1.

(ora serrata).THE EYE. 668 Fig. 319. The Lens (Fig. 315, 4) is situated in front of the vitreous humour, and is kejit in its place by the sii..yicnmri/ liyammt, a transparent structure passing from the hyaloid membrane at the era serrata to the junction of the anterior and posterior segments of the capsule. A space called the Canal of Petit (6) may be foimd in the substance of the ligament, around the margin of the lens, but it is doubtful whether this is not arti- ficially produced. The lens is bi-convex, the posterior siu'face being more strongly curved than the anterior. It consists of fibres arranged around two Y-shaped axes, which may be seen, after a little manipulation, upon the anterior and posterior sui'faces of the sti'uctm'e. The central layers are denser than the more circumferential, and fonn what is called the nucleus. Investing the fibrous lamince is a sti-uctureless elastic capsule, which receives at its periphery the attachment of the suspensory ligament. The anterior segment of the capsule is separated fi-om the lens substance by a layer of cells (Fig. 319). The Vitreous Body (Fig. 315, 13) is a transparent structui-e filling the jjosterior part of the eyeball. It consists of a gelatinous substance enclosed in a transparent membrane called the hyaloid memhrane, and is traversed by niunerous delicate and perfectly transparent septa, the existence of which may be denionsti-ated by pressing out the fluid from the body with the fingers. In. foetal Hie it is pierced axiaUy by a vessel which passes to the lens. In an eye fi'om which the vitreous humom- has been removed, the greyish tmijigmented strata of the retina will .shi-ink, leaving exposed the retinal pigment adherent to the inner sm-face of the choroid; and in the bullock's eye will be seen the tapetum htcidum, that gives the coloui'ed appearance peculiar to the lower aniiniils. The tapetum consists of a thick layer of wavy fibrous tissue outside the retinal jjigment. Fig. 319.—The ci78talliiie lens (from Wilson's Anatomy). 1.

Nuclear zone.THE EETINA. 669 [The retina is best seen by looking tbrougli the viti-eous humour of an eye fi'om which the iris and lens have been removed.] The Retina (Fig. 315, g) lines the choroid coat, and is the nervous membrane of the eye. It is connected posteriorly with the optic nerve, and extends in fi-ont as far forward as the finely serrated circle corresponding to the posterior part of the ciliary processes {ora serrata), gradually losing in thickness as it leaves the nerve. Fig. 320. Beyond this point it is continued over the ciliary processes in a modified form, but without any specific nervous elements. The entrance of the optic nerve {optic disc) may be seen as a white circle, the outer side of which lies about one-tenth of an inch to the inner side of the axis of the eye. Radiating from its centre are the branches of the arteria and ve7}a centralis retina'. (Fig. 320). In the axis of the eyeball in the human eye lies a minute depres- sion, the fovea centralis or yellotu spot of Soemmering, the most sensitive point of the retina.

Exainmed by the naked eye, the retina may be divided into an inner transparent layer in contact with the hyaloid membrane, colom-less during life, but greyish in the dead subject; and an outer pigmentary layer, intimately connected with the choroid coat. Under the microscope the membrane is found to consist of eight layers of nervous structures supported by a delicate connective tissue, and arranged as follows, beginning from the inner surface:— 1. The fibrous layer continuous with the optic nerve, composed of radiating nerve fibrillfe which have lost their white substance of Schwann, and are connected with the cells of the gangUonic layer.

The inner molecular layer, consisting of a fine network of processes derived fi-om the ganglion cells, imbedded in a mole- cular supporting material. 4. The inner nuclear layer consisting of transparent nucleus-like bodies. 5. The outer molecular layer much thinner than the inner one. 6. The outer nuclear layer. 7. The haciUar y layer or JacoVa membrane, consisting of a peculiar arrangement of tenninal structures named rods and cones. These are continuous with some fibres called the fibres of Muller, derived from the ganglionic layer and piercing the nuclear and molecular layers. The cones are present in largest proportion in the neigh- bom-hood of the yeUow spot, and in the fovea centralis constitute the only retinal structures. On the inner side of the rods and cones the retinal connective tissue is condensed into a membrana limitans externa. 8. The pigmentary layer, consisting of a single layer of hexagonal pigment cells, which were formerly considered to belong to the choroid coat. In front of the ora serrata the pigmentary layer becomes continuous with the pigment of the ciliary processes, and the other elements of the retina are represented by a layer of columnar cells.

665 THE CHOROID COAT. The Choroid Coat (Fig. 316, 3) is a vascular pigmented mem- brane, expanded over the whole of the posterior portion of the globe of the eye, and continuous in front with the ciliary processes and ii-is. It is pierced by the optic nerve, and at this point is closely connected to the sclerotic; is loosely attached to the inner sua-face of that coat by a delicate connective tissue, called the membrana ftisca. Between the choroid and sclerotic may be seen the two long ciUari] arteries, passing to join the anterior ciliary arteries in Fig. 316. forming the great arterial cii'cle of the iris, and the long and short ciUary nerves running forwards to the ciliary processes and iris. The outer surface of the choroid presents the casa vorticosa, con- verging to foim trunks which pierce the sclerotic between the recti and a little behind the equator of the globe. Within this venous layer is the tunica Rmjschiana or chorio-cupiUuris, a jjlexus of capillaries formed by the breaking up of the short ciliary arteries, which have been seen to pierce the back of the sclerotic near the optic nerve. The dark pigment of the choroid is interspersed Fig. 316.â€”The choroid coat and the distribution of the vasa vorticosa (from Wilson, after Arnold). 1. Part of the sclerotic coat. 2.

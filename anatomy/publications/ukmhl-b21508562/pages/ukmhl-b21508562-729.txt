663 THE CORNEA. margin by the anterior ciHary arteries; and near the equator, by the vente vorticosje. In front it gives insertion to the recti muscles, from which it receives an expansion, and anteriorly to this point the conjunctiva is reflected upon its sm-face, but can be readily stripped np as far forwards as the margin of the cornea. The eyeball behind the corneal margin is surrounded by the Capsule of Tenon (see p. 394). The sclerotic overlaps the margin of the cornea, especially above and below. The tissue of the two structui-es is continuous. Fig. 315. The Cornea (Fig. 315, i) is one of the transparent media of the eye. In man it is perfectly circular when seen from within, but appears wider in the transverse direction if looked at from without, on account of the greater overlapping by the opaque sclerotic above and below. The cm-vature of the cornea varies in different individuals, but the anterior and posterior surfaces are always parallel. Its struc- tural elements are divisible into five layers : 1, anterior epithelium (conjunctiva cornese); 2, anterior elastic lamina; 3, cornea proper; Fig. 315.â€”Longitudinal section of the eye (drawn by H.

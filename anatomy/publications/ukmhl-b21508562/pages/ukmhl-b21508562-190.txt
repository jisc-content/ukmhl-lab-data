THE BACK OF THE LEO. ]54 i Fig. 72. sole it will 1)6 found to be reinforced by a fibrous slip from th<> tendon of the flexor longus ballucis. The Tibialis Posticus (Fig. 72, 15) is the only one of the deep muscles which is attached to both bones of the leg. It is covered by an aponeui'osis, which forms septa between it and the adjacent muscles. It arises from the posterior surface of the tibia, below the oblique line and externally to the flexor longus digitorum, the origin extending to within two inches of the ankle; fi-om nearly the whole length of the inter- osseous membrane; from the whole of the internal surface of the fibvda imme- diately behind the interosseous line, and fi-om the intermuscular septa on each side. The fibres end in a single broad tendon, which passes beneath that of the flexor digitorum at the ankle, and then to its inner side, run- ning in a groove at the back of the internal malleolus and in the most internal division of the annular liga- ment to the sole ; where, after passing Fig. 72.—Arteries of the back of the leg (from Bouamy and Beau). 1.

LIGAMENTS OF THE VERTEBRA. 591 third cartilages have a double synovial membrane, owing to the existence of an interarticular ligament. The fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh cartilages have each a single sjTiovial membrane at Fig. 289. the sternal articulation, and there are additional .sjniovial mem- branes between the sixth and seventh, seventh and eighth, and eighth and ninth costal cartilages. Ltg.\ments of the VeBTEBRjE. [The ligaments of thaspuial column are to be examined by remov- mg all the remaining muscular fibres.] The ligaments of the Bodies of the vertebrte are—1, the Anterior Common Ligament; 2, the Posterior Common Ligament; and 3, the Intervertebral Substance or Pibro-cartilage. The Anterior Common Ligament (Fig. 280, i) is a broad band of fibres extending down the front of the vertebral column, from the axis to the sacrum. The fibres are attached principally to the intervertebral substances, and slightly to the upper and lower margins of the vertebrne; the deep fibres passing between the adjacent bones, while the superficial cross thi-ee or more ver- tebras. The ligament, when divided, will be seen to be thicker opposite the bodies of the vertebra; than on the intervertebral substances; and it is broader m the lumbar than in the cervical and thoracic regions.

317 THE PELVIC FASCIA. symphysis pubis to the spine of the ischium (white line), where it subdivides into a pai'ietal layer called the obturator fascia, and a visceral layer called the recto-vesical. 1. The obturator fascia (Fig. 160, 6), the outer sm-face of which has been exposed in the above dissection, is the special fascia of the obturator internus muscle, to the inner surface of which it is applied. It is attached below to the margin of the great sciatic notch behind, and to the ischial tuberosity and great sacro-sciatic ligament, and to the pubic arch, fomiing the deep layer of the tri- angular ligament. At its lower attachment is a^channel ■(«(«« Z q/ Fig. 160. Alcock) for the pudic vessels and nerves in the outer wall of the ischio-rectal fossa. 2. The recto-vesical fascia (Pig. 160, 8) is fixed in fi-ont to the back of the pubic bones above the origin of the levatores ani, and dips down between these muscles as far as the apex of the prostate, forming two rounded folds, the anterior true {piiho-prostatic) liijaments of the hJadder, beneath which lie the dorsal vein of the penis, open- mg into the prostatic plexus, and the vesico-pubic muscles derived Pig. 160.—Section of pelvis to show the pelvic fascia from the front ("drawn hv J.

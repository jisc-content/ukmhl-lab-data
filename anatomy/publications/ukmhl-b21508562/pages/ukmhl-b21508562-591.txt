THE ANTERIOR ATLA.NTO-AXIAL LIGAMENT, arch of tlie atlas. On each side, this ligament is perforated by the vertebral artery and suboccipital nerve, over which some of its fibres arch. The Lateral Occipito-Atlantal Ligaments (Pig. 254, 4) are short strong bands, passing between the roots of the transverse processes of the atlas and the jugalar processes of the occipital bone. They serve to strengthen the capsular ligaments imiting the Pig. 253. Fig. 254. condyles of the occipital bone with the corresponding articular facets on the upper surface of the atlas. The Anterior Atlanto-Axial Ligament (Fig. 253, 4) resembles the anterior occipito-atlantal hgament, and consists of a superficial and a deep portion. The superficial portion is round, and is con- tmuous with the anterior common ligament, being attached to the anterior tubercle of the atlas and the body of the axis.

THE FRONT OF THE FORE-ARM. 46 In a thin subject these are seen as white lines, running more or less in the direction of the long axis of the limb. [The muscles arising from the internal condyle are to be cleaned as far as possible without disturbing them; a small jjart only of the Eexor sublimis will be thus exposed. The edge of the supinator longus is also to be cleaned. Fig. 19. The radial artery must be shown thi'oughout its course, and the ulnar artery near the wiist at the radial side of the tendon of the flexor carj)i ulnaiis. The median nerve will ajDpear be- tween the tendons of the flexor carpi radialis and flexor sub- limis, and to the radial side of the latter.] The Muscles (Fig. 19) arising from the inner condyle are five in number, foui' being flexors of the carpus and fingers, and one a pronator of the radius. Be- ginning from the outer side, their relative jjositions are:— I, pronator teres ; 2, flexor caiiii Fig. 19.—Superficial dissection of fore- arm and hand (from Bonamy and Beau). 1. Bicei^s. 2.

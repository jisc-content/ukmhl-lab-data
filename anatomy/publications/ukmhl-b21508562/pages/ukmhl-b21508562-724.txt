THE CEREBELLUM. 658 eminence between the limbs of the V, and (7) the uamdic tubercle {a.t.), another grey nucleus external to the outer limb. Some grey matter, the locus cmruleus, is seen in front of the acoustic striae, and close to the superior fovea it may be prolonged to the Aqueduct of Sylvius by a thin reddish or purple streak, the fcem'a violacea or suhstaiitm ferruginea. The posterior vjall or roof is formed by the inferior vei-mifom process of the cerebellum, the valve of Vieussens (with its ligula), Fig 312. and a layer of pia mater continuous with that of the medulla and cerebellum. This membrane is pierced in the middle by the foramen of Magendie, and lateraUy by two other foramina (foramuia of Key and Retzius); and its ventricular surface presents the choroid plexus of the fourth ventricle. po.

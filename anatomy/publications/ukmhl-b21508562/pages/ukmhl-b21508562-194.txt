'I'HE BACK OP THE LEG. 158 Fig. 74. plantar nerve (20), wHcli pierces the internal annular ligament and fascia at tlie inner side of the tendo Achillis, and may be traced to tlie skin of the heel and sole. Parts behind and helo^ the Inner Malleolus (Fig. 75). Although the several parts behind the internal malleolus are only continuations of those which have been already dissected, especial notice should be taken of them in this part of their course, as theii- relations are important. A portion of the skin on the inner side of the heel and sole is to be reflected if necessary, so as to expose the whole breadth of the internal an- nular ligament, which is a thickened portion of the deep fascia of the leg stretching fi'om the inner malleolus to the OS calcis, and giving origin by its lower border to the abductor hallucis. The divisions in the anmilar ligament are foiu- in number, and are occupied as follows, at the level of the ankle. In the fii-st and innermost division is the Fig. 74.â€”Deep dissection of the back of the leg (from Hiisclifeld and Leveille). 1. Popliteal artery. 2. Great sciatic uerve. 3. Adductor magiius. 4.

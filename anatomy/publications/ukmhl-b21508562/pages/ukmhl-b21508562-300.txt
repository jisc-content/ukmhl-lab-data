The pusteHur false ligaments are the margins of the recto-vesical pouch, and are formed by the reflection of the membrane over the ureters. The so-called lateral false ligaments are merely the reflections of the peritoneum from the bladder to the sides of the Fig. 129. pelvis, and the mperior is a fold passing over the ui-achus to the umbilicus. i ^ i In the female (Eig. 129), the pelvis is divided ti-ansversely bv folds of peritoneum reaching fi-om both sides of the uterus to the sides of the pelvis, and called the broad ligaments of tbe uterus; they contain the ovaries, the Eallopiau tubes, the iwnd hgament, and other structures.

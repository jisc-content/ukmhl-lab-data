Internal and exterml rotation are very limited, unless combined with flexion ; the former is chocked by the ischio-fcmoral band, the latter by the upper iwrtion of the ilio-femoral band. The Transverse Ligament consists of fibres bridgmg across the cotyloid n.>tch, blending intimately with the cotyloid hgament, and giving attachment in this position to the capsule. It converts the n..tch into a foramen, which ti'ansmits articular vessels and nerves, and is occupied by a mass of fat passing mto the bottom of the cotyloid depression and into the ligamentum teres. _ The Cotyloid Ligament (Eig. 67, 2) is a filn-o-cartilaginous structure resembling the glenoid ligament in the shoulder-]omt It is triangular on section, presenting two free surfaces covered by synovial membrane, and an attached sm-faco fii-mly fixed to the margin of the acetabulnm and to the transverse ligament where the bone is deficient. . , ,, „ The Ligamentum Teres (Fig. 67, 3) consists of a fold of synovial membrane reflected fi'om the margms of the cotyloid depression (fovea acetabuli) and notch, and fi-om the ligament, to the dimple (fovea capitis) on the head of the femui. it'rios'es two fibrous bands, and some -^V'^^^^;:^^^^;^^^ with that lying at the bottom of the fovea and filbng the cot. loid forlen L fibrous bands, to which the name ^^S^^^^ iVsometimes Umited, are attached one on each side of the :Xoid nih, t^e s-Tf r?=? .ud both pa. to ^:^J:::'^Z.on ..th extemal IS very doubtful, it oeco developed that it coiUd rotation, but m "^^^ ^^f, li producing dis- offer no serious resistance to a toice c 1 1 location.

THE INFERIOR CALCANEO-SCAPHOID LIGAMENT. 193 surface of the greater process of the os calcis, a little behind the calcaneo-cuboid articulation, to the under sm'face of the cuboid behind the ridge. The Inferior Calcaneo-scaplioid Ligament (Fig. 96, 14) is a broad yellow elastic liga- ment, sti-etching between the lesser process of the calca- neum {sKstentncidum tali) and the posterior border of the inferior surface of the sca- phoid bone, blending inter- nally with a, segment of the internal lateral ligament of the ankle-joint. It performs the important function of suiDportiug the keystone of the longitudinal arch of the foot, the head of the astra- galus, which rests upon it between the anterior calca- nean and the scaphoid facets; and in this is' materially assisted by the tendons of the tibialis posticus and of the long flexors of the great and lesser toes, which pass imme- diately beneath it. The uj^per surface of the ligament is Fig. 9f). Fig. 96.â€”Ligaments of tlie sole of the foot (from Sappey). 1. Point of attachment of tendo Achillis. 2. Intei-nal malleolus. 3.

THE EXTERNAL PLANTAR ARTERY. 1G9 nrterr, with the accomiianying nerve, is to be fully traced out, and the lower asjiect of the interossei may be defined.] turning The External Plantar Artery (Fig. 81, 4) after around the accessorius mu.scle takes a deep coiirse beneath the flexor tendons of the lesser toes, the adductor obliquus, the flexor brevis pollicis, but superficial to the interosseous muscles, to the base of the metatarsal bone of the great toe. This deep portion of the artery has been called the plantar arch, and is joined by the communicating branch of the dorsalis i:)edis artery, which enter.s the sole between the first and second metatarsal bones. Branches.—Small recurrent twigs pass backward from the concavity of the arch to supply the tarsus. Three smaM poster I ar perforating! arteries, given off by the plantar arch, pierce the intervals behind the origins of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th dorsal interosseous muscles, and anas- tomose with the interosseous arteries on the dorsum of the foot. Four diijital arteries arise from the anterior part of the arch; the outer one goes to the outer side of the little toe, the others bifm^cate to supply the adjacent sides of four inner Pis. 84.

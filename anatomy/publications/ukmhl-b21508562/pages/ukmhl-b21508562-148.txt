114 THE FRONT OF THE THIGH. Piercing the fascia at several points are the cutaneous nerves of the thigh, some of which have been ah-eady seen, but the foUowmg are now to be traced to theh- distributions and then to theu- origins, the fascia being removed as maybe necessary for the latter pm-pose. The Internal cutaneous nerve (Eig. 52, 7, ») is a branch of the anterior crui'al; it gives two or thi-ee small twigs to the uM^er and inner parts of the thigh, and crosses the femoral artery m Scarpa s triangle. Either before or after doing so it divides into two branches, anterior and posterior. The auteri<>r branch becomes cutaneous in the lower third of the thigh, the filaments reaching as far as the patellar plexus; the posterior branch appears close to the saphenous vein a little above the knee, and its branches unite with those of the other branch, with the internal saphenous neiwe and occSonaUy with a superBcial branch of the obtui-ator, and are distributed over and a little below the inner side oi the^-^e^^^^^ The Long or Mernal Saphenous ncrre (Fig. o2, 16 "^^^^^^ «f which wiU be afterwards seen) becomes cutaneous at he mnei side Tf the knee ioint, where it lies at first in fi-ont of the saphenous veif Be or becoming cutaneous it sends a large bi-anch forward to L si n of the patella {ramus cntaneus patellce (14) winch piei-ces the sLtius, andUes with branches of f V^^Tirharbee cutaneous and external popUteal nerves to form what has been called the plexus yatdlw. ^,,.;«V,1p but thev The Siierfidal Veins of the thigh are very vauable, but they either open into the saphenous vein separately or oi-m one or mte seplte branches which join the main trunk at or near the saphenous opening.

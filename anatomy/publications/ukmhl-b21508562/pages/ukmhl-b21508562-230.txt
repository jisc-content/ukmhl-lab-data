192 LIGAMENTS OF THE TARSUS. OS calcis. The posterior (Fig. 92, 12) is placed between the posteiior parts of the two bones, close to the groove in the astragalus through which the tendon of the flexor longus hallucis passes. The irder- ossenus (Fig. 93, 5) ligament will be seen when the joint is opened. It is a strong thick band, passing from the groove between the two inferior articular siu'faces of the astragalus, to the corresponding o-roove between the two articular surfaces on the superior aspect of the calcaneum; it divides the sub-astragalar synovial cavity into â–  two parts, an anterior continuous with the astragalo-scaphoid pint, and a posterior directly beneath the ankle-joint. The double articulation, to which the name talo-mhaneo-scaiM jomt may be given, is the seat of nearly the whole of the lateral motion (abduction and adduction) of the foot (Fig. 97). . The tendon of the tibialis posticus may now be seen crossmg the deltoid ligament, and will be found to have a fibro-cartilage developed in it where it passes under the head of the astragalus and remforces the inferior calcaneo-scaphoid ligament. It is attached to the tuberosity of the scaphoid bone and the adjacent internal crmei- form bone, and gives slips also to all the other bones 0 the.tarsus with the exception of the astragalus, and to the second, th^d, and fourth metatarsal bones. These must be removed to see the ti'ue ligaments of the joints. 4. t ^x,^ Ligaments of the Tarsus.-On the dorsal aspect of the remahiing tarsal bones will be found a number of short bands of fitees, wWch pass between adjacent bones and have received nam . as ligaments accordingly, on the plantar aspect there are smrilar hnttZLv ligaments, three of which are worthy of special notice. v"z the lono. and short calcaneo-cuboid ligaments, and the calcaneo- TanW ligaments Another set of ligaments, called n.terosseo.s. :Zl:uL'o;pUlatei.lsru-face^ facets are deficient (Fi8^ 97), undwdl be seen late.

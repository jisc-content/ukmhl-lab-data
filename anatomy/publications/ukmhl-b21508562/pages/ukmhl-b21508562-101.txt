THE SUPERFICIAL PALMAR ARCli. 71 simplj' form a covering for the nuiscles of the thumb and little finger. The Palmaris Brevis (Fig. 18, i6) is a small muscle running transversely below the pisiform bone and immediately beneath the skin. A7-ising fi'om the inner edge of the central fascia it crosses the ulnar artery and nerve, and is inserted into the skin on the inner side of the hand. It is supplied by the superficial division of the ulnar nerve. During its contraction it puckers the skin at its insertion, increases the prominence of the hypothenar eminence, and slightlj' deej^ens the hollow of the hand. [The central portion of the palmar fascia is to be detached from the annular ligament and tiu-ned down, care being taken not to injure the vessels and nerves which are close beneath; and these are then to be cleaned.] The Superficial Palmar Arch (Kg. 30, e) is the direct con- tinuation of the ulnar artery, which reaches the palm by passing over the annular ligament on the radial side of the pisiform bone, and beneath a little fibrous slip from the flexor carpi ulnaris (p. 53): it then lies between the palmar fascia and the tendons and nerves. The vessel is subject to very great variations, but if regular, forms an arch with the convexity forwards, reaching to about midway between the annular ligament and the root of the middle finger, as far as the middle of the three palmar furrows. The arch is completed on the radial side either bj^ the superficial Figs. 30, 31, and 32.â€”Palm and back of the hand (from Maclise's Surgical Anatomy). Figs. 30 and 31. A. Radial artery. B.

LIGAMENTS OF THE ATLA.S AND AXIS. 526 portion is broad and thin, and extends from the anterior arch of the atlas to the body of the axis. The Posterior Atlanto-Axial Ligament (Fig. 254, 5) resembles the posterior occipito-atlantal ligament, and is composed of white fibrous tissues, Uned by a layer of yellow elastic tissue. It extends between the posterior arch of the atlas and the laminre of the axis, and is pierced by the second cervical nerve. The Capsular Atlanto-Axial ligament is sufficiently loose to Fig. 255.

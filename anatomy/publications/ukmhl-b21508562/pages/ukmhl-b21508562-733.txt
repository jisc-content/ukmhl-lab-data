667 THE CILIARY PROCESSES. [In order to see the cHiary body and processes a third eye sWd be divided cii-cularly thi-ough tbe sclerotic and choroid coats, with- otitdlmaging. the vitreous Worn-; the vitreous hiunom- and lens a " then to %e carefully separated from the anterior part of the Jhoroid, the ciHary prLsfes being detached ^o^^f ^,^0°;^ membrane, upon which they will leave a cu-cle marked with moie or less pigment (cii-cle of Zinn). The cihary processes and ms are now seen from behind.] The Ciliary Processes (Fig. 318, 4) are vascular fringes, which resemble a series of minute convergent conical ridges, formmg a rin" posterior to the iris and continuous behind with the choroid, the°point of junction with the latter being indicated by a festooned Fig. 318. / line, the ora serrata. They are covered with a thick layer of pig- ment cells (deficient, however, over the most prominent part of the larger cones), continuous with the uvea of the iiis in front, and with the pigmental layer of the retina behind. Each cone represents a vascular glomerulus. Between the anterior margin of the sclerotic and the ciliary body is a venous canal, which runs round the entire circumference of the eye and is called the Canal of Bchlcmm or sinus circulus iridis (Fig. 315, 5). [The lens will be seen on the posterior half of this section, or may be shown on the first eye by carefully removing the iris.]. Fig. 318.—Anterior half of the eye, seen from within (from Wilson), 1.

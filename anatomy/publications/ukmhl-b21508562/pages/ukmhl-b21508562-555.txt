MUSCLES OF THE PALATE. 489 during its passage. The palaio-phar/pii/ei draw down the soft lialate, aud, meeting in the middle line, shut off the buccal portion of the pharynx fi-om the nasal portion, and form an inclined plane along which the food can glide. Thej^ are assisted in this action by the palatal fibres of the superior constrictor. The laryngeal and palatal attachments serve equally as fixed points during deglutition, lowering the hinder portion of the palate and raising the larynx and pharynx. The muscles also aid in vocalisation Fig. 236. of high by drawing up the larynx during the production notes. The salpim/o-phnryngei, when present, aid in opening the Ji.ustachian tubes during deglutition. The levator palati and azygos uvulco are sii.pplied by palatine blanches from the facial through the posterior palatine branch of the .spheno-palatine (Meckel's) ganglion ; the tensor palati by the Fig. 236.â€”Muscles of the palate (drawn by J.

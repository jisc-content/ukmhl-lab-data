592 THE THORAX. [To see the posterior common ligament it will be necessary to remove the spinal cord, if this has not been already done. The saw is to be applied over the pedicles of, say, six dorsal vertebrae, and these being divided on each side, the remains of the spinal cord can be removed, when the posterior ligament will be seen on the backs of th e bodies of the vertebrte. The ligamenta subflava can be dissected upon the vertebral arches which have been sawn away.] The Posterior Common Ligament (Fig. 283, 3) is fomid upon the posterior aspect of the bodies of the vertebrtB from the axis to Fig. 283. FifC. 284. the sacrum. Unlike the anterior common ligament it is broad opposite the intervertebral substances, with which it is closely connected, and narrow opposite the bodies of the vertebroe ; and is broader in the cervical than in the lumbar region, and thickest m the thoracic region. It is composed of superficial and deep fibres like the anterior ligament. The Intervertebral Substances (Fig. 283, i) are found between the bodies of all the vertebra? from the axis to the sacrum, and are largest in the lumbar region. Each disc is composed of concentric layers of fibrous tissue and fibvo-cartilage externally, with a soft elastic material in the centre. The discs are thicker - Fig. 283.â€”Posterior lig.uucnt of the vertebnt (from Wilson). 1, 1. Intervertebral substances. 3. Posterior common ligament. 2. Pedicles of vertebrie sawn through.

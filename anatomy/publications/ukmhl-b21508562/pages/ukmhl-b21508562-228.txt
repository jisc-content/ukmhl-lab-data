190 THE ANKLE-JOINT. the flexor longus hallucis, and behind the external malleolns, the tendons of the peroneus longus and brevis (Fig. 93). The ankle- joint has anterior, posterior, and two lateral ligaments. The Anterior Ligament is a broad thin membrane which is seldom seen entire. It is attached to the lower margin of the tibia, and to the superior surface of the astragalus close to its head, and joins the lateral ligament on each side. The Posterior Ligament is not described by many author.-?, d it is seldom represented by more than a few fibres stretching an Fig. 94, over the synovial membrane between the back of the tibia and the astragalus. . The Internal Lateral Ligament (Fig. 9-4, i. 2, 3, 4} is triangular in shape, and hence has been called di-ltouh The apex is attached to the tip and borders of the internal malleolus, and the base to the posterior part of the astragalus, the lesser process ot the OS calcis, the inferior calcaneo-scaphoid ligament, and the tuberosity of the scaphoid bone. A strong derp portion passes from the apex of the malleolus to the side of the astragalus. The External Lateral Ligament (Fig. 95) consists of throe slips- two almost horizontal attached to the astragalus, and one ■pig, 94—Ligaments of the inner sicle 1 2, 3, 4.

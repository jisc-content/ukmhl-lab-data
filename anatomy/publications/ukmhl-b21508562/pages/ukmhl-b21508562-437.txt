POSTERIOR TRIANGLE OF NECK. 379 the directions indicated by their names, and passing over the clavicle and acromion process of the scapula, are distributed to the skin upon the upper part of the pectoral muscle and shoulder where they are seen by the dissector of the arm. [The anterior and posterior boundaries of the triangle (the sterno- mastoid and ti-apezius) are now to be defined, but only the edges of the muscles need be cleaned. The descending nerves being detached andtui.ned up, the deep branches of the ce^'vical pS and the spmal-accessoiy nerve passing obliquely between the borders of the sterno-mastoid and the trapezius are to be dissected out, and also the omo-hyoid muscle, which will be found running downwards and outwards at a variable distance above the clavicle . theInternal lugular vem is to be followed as far as convenient, and numeZis large veins, which form a plexus at the lower part of the trianJ e and commiuncate free y w th the external jugullr, are to be noSfd _ The Superficial Portion of the Deep Cervical Fascia, which 177 f "^^^^^^^P*'^ at the spinous processes of the vertebra, and encloses the trapezius muscle, then crosses the posterior triangle £ lZ r ^t-^^-^^-^-^toid, and is continued on to riangle 1 gives a special covei-ing to the omo-hyoid muscle, and is attached below to the back of the clavicle and first rib : in the taL^T?

THE INTEROSSEOUS MUSCLES. 81 (abductor indicis) into the radial side of the base of the first phalanx - of the fore-finger; the 2nd into the radial side of the base of the fu'st phalanx of the middle finger; the 3rd into the ulnar side of the same phalanx; the 4th into the ulnar side of the first phalanx of the ring-finger, each muscle, as in the case of the palmar interossei, giving a shp of insertion into the corresponding extensor tendon. Action.—The insertions into the base of the first phalanx (Fig. 37) enable the interossei to act as flexors of that phalanx, and to give lateral movement to the fingers to which they are attached. The slip (c) sent forward to join the extensor tendon extends the second and third phalanges; and thus the action of the interossei includes adduction to and abduction from the median line of the hand, with flexion of the first and extension of the second and third phalanges. Fig. 37. The lumbricales act in a similar manner, but have more power in initiating the flexion of the first phalanges, and they strengthen the radial side of the metacaz'po-phalangeal joints. The whole of the interossei are supplied by the deep branch of the ulnar nerve. [The interosseous muscles of the hand should be compared with those of the foot, when the same arrangement will be found to exist in both cases, with the exception that, in the foot, the imaginary lino for abduction and adduction is drawn through the long or second toe, the muscles being aiTanged in accordance.] Pig. 37.—Attachment of an interosseous muscle (from Duohenne). a: Interosseous muscle. c.

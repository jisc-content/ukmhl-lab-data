604 THE BACK. Tke Obliquus Superior (Fig. 287, lo) arises from the transverse process of the atlas, and is inserted into the outer part of the inter- space between the superior and inferior curved lines of the occipital bone, the attachment being separated from.that of the complexus by an obUqiie ridge joining the two curved lines. The muscle overlaps the rectus major above, and the occipital artery runs along its upper border. It is Fig. 287. less oblique in directi(jn than the rectus major. Both recti muscles and the superior oblique, acting with theu- fellows of the opposite side, extend the head at the occipito-atlantal joint; and the rectus major, owing to its oblique direction, is also a rota- tor of the atlanto-axial joint, and sligbtly of the occipito - atlantal joint when acting singly. The inferior oblique is essen- tially a rotator of the atlanto-axial joint; and the superior oblique extends the bead at the occipito-atlantal, and may give rise to very limited movements of rotation and lateral inclination at the same articulation. It must be remembered that the motion of the atlanto-axial joint is purely rotatory, while that of the occipito- atlantal joint is mainly in the direction of flexion and extension, with a small range of rotation and lateral flexion. The Suboccipital Triangle (Fig. 287) is a nanw space covered in by the complexus, and bounded on its three sides by the rectus capitis posticus major, and the two obUqui; its floor being formed by the posterior arch of the atlas and the posterior occipito-atlantal Pig. 287.â€”Suboccipital region (drawn by J.

Its epithelium is continuous -with that of the cornea. If the conjimctiva is carefully divided over the sclerotic, the attachments of the muscles of the eyeball and the anterior part of the capsule of Tenon may be seen. The student shoidd recognise with his finger the prominences of the nasal, malar, and maxiUary bones, and the margin of the Orbit; opportunity should be taken also to examine the external ear. The Pinna (Fig. 210) is composed of fibre-cartilage covered with skin. Its outer rim is caUed the hehx (i), and the forked elevation within it the ardihelix (5); the groove between the two is the fossa of tlie lielrx (7), and the depression sepa- rating the two branches of the antihelix is the fossa of the antihelix [?>). The deep cavity leading to the meatusexternus is the concha (9), and the little nodule in front of it the trayiis (10), the corresponding nodule behind being the antitraijus (11). The lowest part of the ear is the lobitle, which consists of fat-bearing connective tissue. The exti-insic mus- cles of the aiu-icle (anterior, superior and posterior) have been seen in the dissection Fie 211 â€”The pinna and its muscles, as seen from behind (from Wilson, ^' ' after Arnold). 1, 2. 3. 4, 4 vitli the 1.

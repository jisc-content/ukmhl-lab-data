:309 THE LIVER. The hepatic arteiy and the portal vein both divide into right and left branches, and the cystic branch should be traced to the gall- bladder from the right artery. The piece of the vena cava removed with the liver is to be laid open, when the large hepatic veins, from the right, left and Spigelian lobes, will be seen opening into it, and its coats will be found almost devoid of muscular tissue. In order to learn the arrangement of the vessels in the liver, the vena portse should be carefully opened for some distance with a'pair Fig. 155. of scissors. Through the thin wall of the vein a branch of injected nepatic artery will then be seen, and accompanying it is a branch 01 the hepatic duct, the three vessels thus lying side by side in a canal {^portal canal), bounded by an inflection of Glisson's capsule, ana containing, besides the vessels named, branches of lymphatics, nerves, and some connective tissue. The portal canal thus encloses representatives of all the structures entering at the portal fissure. yjm ot the hepatic veins being laid open in a similar way, will be seen to run alone in close contact with the hepatic lobules An incision into any part of the liver will show on its cut v!iW M " oi^^^n^s, some usually gaping,_the hepatic vems, others more or less collapsed, and having by their sides the Fig. 155.-DiaKram of the circulation in the lobules of the liver (after Iviernan). veins. b.

33 THE MUSCITLO-SPIRAL NERVE. Fis. 14. and, after giving off an internal catanemis branch to the inner side of the arm (which usually arises in common with the branch to the inner head of the triceps), winds backwards around the humerus in the musculo-spiral groove, lying against the inner head of the tiiceps and afterwards between it and the outer head of that muscle, here giving off two external cutaneous branches. Branches to the triceps, anconeus and outer portion of the brachialis anticus will be seen in a .subsequent rhssection. Having pierced the external intermuscular septum, it runs down between the supi- nator longus and brachialis anticus, to both of which and to the extensor cai-jn radialis longior branches may be traced; and ends by dividing into radial and posterior interosseous nerves in front of the external condyle.

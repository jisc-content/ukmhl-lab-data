POSTERIOR TRIANGLE Of NECK. 381 the apex of the triangle i,s wider than usual, a portion of the corn- plexus may be seen, and not iufi-equently, where the attachment of the sterno-mastoid to the clavicle is not well developed, both the anterior scalenus and the phi-enic nerve lying on it appear in the posterior space. The ti-iangle is subdivided into two lesser triangles by the posterior belly of the omo-hyoid muscle, at a variable distance above the clavicle. The upper or occipital trianyh' contains the superficial branches of the cervical plexus derived from the first four cervical nerves; the spinal-accessory nerve (which may be traced from the level of the transverse process of the atlas along the outer surface of the levator anguli scapulte into the trapezius, where it communicates with branches of the 3rd and 4th cervical nerves); muscular branches of the cervical plexus to the levator anguli scapula, scalenus medius and trapezius ; communicating branches with the spinal accessory the occipital artery, the transverse cervical vessels, the posterior external jugular vein, the upper part of the brachial plexus, and some of the lymphatic glands placed along the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid. The hum-OT supra-clavicular triangle contains the lower part of the brachial plexus and their supra-clavicular branches; the third part of the subclavian artery; the nerve to the subclavius • the transverse cervical vessels ; the supra-scapular vessels and nerve • and the external jugular vein, with its lower tributaries; all of which must now be dissected. The size of this space varies with the level at which the omo-hyoid crosses the neck, with the extent of clavicular attachment of the sterno-mastoid, and, more miportantly, with the degree of elevation of the clavicle.

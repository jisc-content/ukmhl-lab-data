DORSAL ARTERY OF THE PENIS. 217 The Artery to the Bulb (Fig. 102, 7) passes transversely in- wards to suijply the bulb, to reach which it has to pierce the suiierficial layer of the triangular ligament close to the middle lino. It generally gives a branch to Oowjjer's gland of the same side. The Artery to the Corpus Cavernosum (Fig. 107, 14) pierces Fig. 107. the superficial layer of the triangular ligament to enter the cms. It is accompanied by a vein. The Dorsal Artery of the Penis pierces the fore part of the superficial layer of the triangular ligament, and then the suspen- sory Kgament, to reach the upper sui-face of the organ, where it will be subsequently traced. When the pudic artery is small, the dorsal arteries are derived from the trunks of the internal iliacs, and reach the penis by Fig. 107.—Arteries of the perinteum superficial arteries are 1. Tlie penis ; the crus penis of the left side is cut through. 2. Accelerator urinaa muscle. 3. Erector penis. 4. Anus surrounded by the sphincter ani. •5. Rami of ischium and pubes. b. Tuberosity of ischium. 7. Lesser sacro-sciatic ligament, n. Coccyx. 9. Internal pudic artery, crossing the spine of tlie iscln'um and entering the perinieum. (from Wilson). On the right side the seen, on the left the deep. 10. Inferior hemorrhoidal branches. 11. Hujierficialperiuajal artery, giving off the transverse artery upon rri ^^^'^ '■'''"Inversus periniei muscle. 12. The same artery on tlie left side cut off. 13. Artery of the bulb. 14. The artery of the corpus caverno- sum and the dorsal artery of the penis.

THE ANKLE-JOINT. 189 from it, a transverse (or inferior) Jiyamenf, which reaches from the external malleolus to the posterior surface and malleolus of the tibia; and the interosseous ligament just described. A fold of synovial membrane is often prolonged for a very short distance between the two bones from the ankle-joint. Ankle-Joint and Articulations of the Foot. The ankle-joint is almost a pure ginglymus, moving 15° (from the position of station), in the direction of dorsal flexion, and 45° in that of plantar flexion. It has in f ront from within outwards the Fig. 93. tendons of the tibialis anticus and extensor propriiis hallucis, the anterior tibial vessels and nerve, the extensor longus digitormn, and the peroneus tertius. Fixing these structures in place is the anterior annular ligament, and more superficially lies the musculo- cutaneous nerve breaking up into its internal and external branches. Jle/rind, arranged from within outwards are the tendons of the tibialis po.sticus and flexor digitonim longus, the posterior tibial vessels and nerve (or it mny be the plantar vessels and nerves), Fig. 93.—Vertical section of anlde-joint (after Henle). 1.

THE BACK OF THE FORE-ARM. 58 distribution of tbese dorsal digital nerves usually does not extend beyond the middle of the second phalanges, the distal portion of the dorsal integument receiving its supply from the palmar digital nerves. The Superficial Veins (Fig. 23) across the back of the meta- carpus originate in an irregular arch, from which arise the radial and posterior ulnar veins at its inner and outer extremities; these have akeady been ti-aced to the cephalic and basilic veins respec- tively. [The deep fascia is to be removed from the back of the fore-ai-ui and hand, with the exception of a band about an inch wide, which is to be left opposite the lower end of the radius, to form the posterior annular hicjament (Fig. 24, 15). The slender posterior interosseous artery to the outer side of the extensor carpi ubians is to be pre- served It will be found to be impossible to remove the fascia entii-ely near the elbow, where it is incorporated with the muscles. J Muscles of the Back of the Tore-arm (Fig. 24).—The fore- ai-m muscles arising fi'om and above the external condyle of the hiunerus are either extensors or supinators, and wiU be found m the following order, beginning fi-om the radial side:—1, supinator longus; 2, extensor carpi radiaHs longior ; 3, extensor carpi radiahs brevier; 4, extensor communis digitorum; 5, extensor mmum digiti- 6, extensor carpi ulnaris; and 7, anconeus (covered by fascia'prolonged from the triceps); another muscle, the supmator brevis, Ues under cover of the long muscles and will be seen later. Arising deeply from the bones of the ./b;'e-arm, mil be found torn- short extensor muscles, which hold the following position m relation to one another from the radial side:-!, extensor ossis mctacai-pi pollicis ; 2, extensor piimi internodii pollicis ; 3, extensor secundi internodii polUcis; 4, extensor indicis. The muscles arising from the himierus have additional origins from the fascia of the arm or from intermuscular septa derived from it; and two, viz., the extensor carpi ulnaris imd supinator brevis, have additional origins from the ulna. The Supinator Radii Longus (Fig. 24, 4) is a long muscle and has been already seen in great part in previous dissections ot the bend of the elbow and fore-arm. It arises from the upper two-thh'ds of the external supra-con.lylar ridge of the humerus, and from the external intermuscular septum of the arm, which separates it from the triceps; and is inserted into the base of the styloi.l process of the radius. Its tendon is crossed by two short extensors of the thumb at the annular Ugament, and the radial ncn e passes beneath it to reach the back of the hand. It is supphed by a

THE OTIC GANGLION. 467 with it may possibly be fouud u small piuk body, tbe otic ganglion, lying on the deep aspect of the trunk of the third division of the nith nerve.] The Otic Ganglion (Fig. 228, 7) is seen as a small pinkish body situated below the foramen ovale, on the deep surface of the inferior maxillary nerve, and close to the cartilaginous portion of the Eustachian tube. Its motiir and sensory Fig. 228. roots are derived from the nerve to the internal pteiygoid, its sympu- thctic root fi'om the nervi molles on the middle meningeal artery. It also receives the small superficial petrosal nerve, and so communi- cates with the facial and the tympanic branch of the glosso-pharjTigeal nerve. The otic gaugUon sup- plies the tensor tympani and tensor palati, and communicates with the auriculo-temporal the chorda tympani and the vidian nerves. [The internal pterygoid muscle is to bo cut through and completely removed from its attachment to the inner surface of the external pterygoid plate. The tensor palati lying x pon the internal pterygoid p ate will now be exposed, and pSstSi to i? the superior constrictor of the pharynx, with the ascencUn > pharyngeal artery Ijmg upon the latter.] t-eniunp Fig. 228.-Internal view of the otic ganglion and t.vmpannn, (from Hirschfeld and Leveille). 1.

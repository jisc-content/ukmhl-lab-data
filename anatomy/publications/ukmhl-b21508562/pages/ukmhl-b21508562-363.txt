311 THE KIDNEYS. The Pelvis (Fig. 156, P) will usually be found to be subdivided into two tubular portions, the superior and inferior pelves, each of which may branch into smaller tubes, called Infnndibida, before breaking up into their terminal branches or Calices. The calices are fixed to the bottom of the sinus renalis, around little nodules of kidney substance termed ila.e papilhe. or mamilla; (c), which are the apices of the pi/ram/ds of Malpifjlii (m). These pyramids are conical in form (triangular in the section), and darker in colour Fig. 156. than the rest of the tissue, and are arranged more or less regularly side by side. They constitute what is caUed the tubular or medul- lary substance of the kidney ; the lighter granular portion or coriex lies at the margin of the section, forming a layer over the bases of the pyramids, and sending processes called Cohimvs of Beriiui [ !) between them.

THE TEMPORO-MAXTLLAKY ARTICULATION. 440 branches, the aiiriculo-temporal nerve, the inferior dental nei-ve, and some acini of the parotid gland. The lower attachment of the ligament is pierced by the mylo-hyoid vessels and nerve. The sfi/Jo-maxillary ligament is merely a thickened portion of the deep cervical fascia, extending from the styloid process to the angle of the jaw. It separates the parotid from the sub-maxillary gland, and gives origin to the stylo-glossus. The sijnovial memhranes are two in number, one above, the other Fig. 218.

204 THE PERIN^.UM. the rhm (jmiialis and are continued backwards to the posterior boundary of the perinEBum, where they are united by the imdi-rmr commissure. In a female who has not borne children, a small trans- verse fold of mucous membrane may be seen just within the pos- terior commissui-e, which is called the fourchdte, and between the two is the fossa mivicul.aris. By separating the labia the clitoris will be seen at the upper part of the vulva, resembling a diminutive penis in appearance and structirre, but having only a small and ill-defined <ikms and j^rftpMC", and no urethral perforation. The mjmphce or hihia minora extend obliquely downwards ti-om each side of the cUtoris, being connected both with the organ itself and its prepuce, and are lost in the labia majora about midway between the anterior and posterior commissures. _ The vestihule is a triangular interval, with the apex at the clitons and the base at the orifice of the vagina, the sides being formed by the nymphte. An inch below the clitoris is the mmtus urnuinus, the margin of which is slightly prominent, and is placed unmediately above the orifice of the vagina. , •, ■, . The entrance of the vagina may be more or less occluded by a hymen, which is a, reduplication of mucous membrane, usually ot a crescentic form with the concave border upwards The caruncm^ myrtiformes are Httle projections fi-om the vaginal wall left by the rupture of the hymen. On each side of the vagina, midway between its anterior and posterior waUs, immediately in fi-on of the hymen or its remains, are the orifices of the v^dvo-vagimd glands (or g ands of Bartholin). The orifices of numerous sebaceous foUicles will also be found scattered over the vulva. j „ The tissues separating the lower ends of the vagina and rectum are known as the 2>er/.cm/ hody, and sometimes under the lU-selec ed term of perineum. The base of the perinteal body, formed by the integument intervening between the posterior commissure of the labif and -the anal orifice, is from an mch to an mch and a hal long, but becomes greatly stretched during labour. The hngei shotud be introduced into the vagina to ascertam the position and concHtion of the cervix and os uteri. Boundaries of the Perin^um.-These are he - sexes, and can be best ascertained by placmg a pelvis, o^.^^^i*^!^ ^he ligaments are preserved, in the same position as the «^^b^ect, when the space under examination will be seen to correspond wi h th^^ nferior aperture of the pelvis. In front is ^^^^ ff .^^^j with the divergent ischio-pubic rami extending to the tuberosities of The ischia, which fonn the lateral boundaries. Posteriorly are the

THE SIDE OF THE NECK. 396 In addition to these structures, Mr. I.ockwood describes a smpensory hand which is attached to the inner and outer walls of the orbit, and forms a kind of hammock passing beneath and supporting the globe. If all the contents of the orbit are removed, the lO-Mal bnnoM ,,/ the superior maxillary nerve [teiiiporo-malar) may be seen passing through the spheno-maxiUary fissure, and dividing into two branches—the sahcutaiieus iimIch, which pierces the malar bone, and the temporal branch, which pierces the outer waU of the orbit to reach the temporal integument (p. 361); and the spheno- maxillary fissui-e will be found closed by involuntary muscular fibre, the orhitalis. The Side of the Neck. [The head is to be drawn as far back as possible by means of a hook placed in the chin, and the side to be dissected (by preierence the right side first) should be made prominent by means of blocks placed beneath. Before beginning the d-^^'^tr,; ^^^^ should pass his finger along the median line of the neck, and reco^nis^e the followmg poiSts. Firstly, the lower jaw, and fi-om an inch and a half to two inches below it the slight P^lfctiou o^ the hvoid bone ; next a hollow, corresponding to the thyro-hyoid membrane, and below this the projecting angle of the thyroi^ Silage (pomum Adami), which is very sma 1 m women; about an nch beFow the pomum Adami is a depression corresponding t« Se So-thyroid space, through which laryngotomy if. performed stm lower will be felt the hard ring of the cricoid cartilage and m a thin subject the rings of the trachea may be recognised lowei down; sometimes also the isthmus of the thyroid body may be felt cTO^si^ff the trachea, usually over the second and third rings. An indsfon is to be made from the chm to the sternum, and another outwards along the clavicle as. far as incision P^.^ with hooks.] The Platysma Myoides (Fig. 185, 6) is now seen to reach to the side of the lower jaw, where it is partially --;^<^.^- its fibres-blend with the muscles of the lower hp. The niuscle decussates in the median line with its feUow of the op^iosite side fo a short distance above, but at the lower part o the rinno-ular interval exists between the two. A few small bianche^ the superficial cervical nerve will be found l-rcmg the mus le and the external and anterior jugular vein., may sometimes be seen through its fibres.

161 FLEXOR BREVLS DIGITORUM. [The central portion of the fascia is to be cut across about two niches from the heel and may then be turned down over the toes without injunng the digital nerves, when the flexor brevis cHgitorum will be exposed m part, and the intermuscular septa on each side may be seen. The lateral portions of the fascia are to be removed, and the abductor hal- lucis and abductor minimi digiti cleaned.] The First Layer of Muscles consists of the flexor brevis digitorum in the middle, the abducior hallucis to the inner side, and the abductor minimi digiti to the outer side. The Flexor Brevis Digi- torum (Fig. 80, ii) arises ivom. the anterior border of the inner tuberosity of the os calcis; from the plantar fascia covering it (which has therefore been left undistui'bed); and fi-om the in- termuscular septa on each side. It divides into four tendons, which pass into tendinous sheaths on the under sui'faces of the four smaller toes, and are perforated by the tendons of the long flexor as in the hand (p. 74) ; and are inserted, each by two slips, into the sides of the second pha- langes. The tendon to the little toe is often a mere thread. Fig. 79. Fig. 79.-Superficial nerves of the^s^le of the foot (from Hirschfeld and 1. 1. Cutaneous plantar brauchea of posterior tibial nerve. 2.

HQ THE FRONT OF THE THIGH. Tho Anterior Crural Nerve (Fig. o.. 5) soppUM , . Action—The quadriceps extensor is the great extensor of the leg upon the thigh, and is therefore in constant requisition in walking, but it will he observed that in standing upright the yasti are relaxed, and the patella can be moved freely from side to side. The rectus, in addition, flexes the thigh upon the pelvis; and, when the leg is fixed, flexes the pelvis upon the femur. It is supj,hed by the anterior crvuval nerve. The Femoral Artery in Hunter's Canal (Fig. o4, ig).— Hunter's canal is an intermuscular space beneath the sartonus m the middle third of the thigh, and is continuous with the apex of Scarpa's triangle above, and with the popliteal space below It contains the femoral vessels, the long saphenous nerve, and the nerve to the vastus internus. It is bounded beh ind by the adductors longus and magnus, externaUy by the vastus internus, and w front by a fascial aponeurosis stretching over the vessels fi-om the external to the posterior wall, and by the sartorius. It ends at the opening iar the adductor magnus, where the artery enters he popbtealspace On laying open the canal, the femoral arteiy ^vlU be found with its vein behind and external to it, and a second smaller vena comes is often seen on the opposite side of the vessel. Some deep h-mphatic cords accompany tie veins, and the whole of the vessels are inves ed by a delicate collective tissue-sheath. With these but outside he sheath are the long saphenous nerve and, external to this, the nerve 0 the vastus internus Jiving filaments to its muscle. The saph™ nerve Hes at first to the outer side of the artery but crosses it below to whid around the tendon of the sartorius and become cutaneous on the inner side of the knee. The Opernng in the Adductor Magnus, as it is commonly called is in realty an opening between the round tendon of the adductor magnus on the inner side, and the fibres of the vastus -ternus -d L femur on the outer side. The only structures passmg through it are the femoral vessels with some deep lymphatics.

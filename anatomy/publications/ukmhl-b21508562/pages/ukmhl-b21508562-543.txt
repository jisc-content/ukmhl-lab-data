THE GLOSSO-PHARYNGEAL NERVE. 479 atu-iciilar fissure between the mastoid process and jjeti-osa (Fig. 232, ly) ; it may communicate with the trunk of the facial in the aqueductus Palloi^ii, and on emerging fi'om the auricular fissure it divides into two branches, both of which communicate with the posterior auricular branch of the facial and supply the back of the concha. The (/aii(/7ion of the trunk is thi-ee-quarters of an inch long, and of a pink colour, and has branches of communication with the spinal- accessory, hypoglossal, superior cervical gangHon, and the loop between the fir.st and second cervical nerves. It gives oft' pharyno-eal and superior laryngeal branches, which have been described at p. 471. The cerviral ninliac branches, two or thi-ee in number, are slender filaments arising a little below the ganglion of the trunk ; com- municatiiig usually with the external larjnigeal, and ending on the left side in the superficial canliac plexus, and on the right in the deep plexus. The Glosso-pharyngeal Nerve (Fig. 231, 2) lies in a little special notch in the lower border of the petrous bone as it leaves the jugular foramen, and is separated from the tenth and eleventh nerves by a process of dura mater. Its further coiu-se has been already traced (pp. 406 and 468). It presents two .small ganglia, one at the upper part of the fora- men, the sn2>eriur or Jugular f/uug/ion, which is of very smaU size and the other at the lower part of the foramen, which is larger, and is caUed the inferior or pet.rnus gang/iou ov gamjlion of Amhrsch (Fig. 232, 2). • ■ The upper gangHon involves only some of the fibres of the nerve but all pass through the lower ganglion. The lower ganglion gives four branches of covimunicution, one with the superior ganglion of the vagus, one to the amicular branch 7. Loip .itween 1st an.! 2na cen icai '^S;!,:^..^:^-^-'- ^^'^ H.

THIS POPLITEAL SPACE. tuberosity of the ischium to the perinEeum, and other cutaneous hranches wHch descend to supply the back of the thigh, pophteal reoion and upper half or more of the calf (13). The Inferior Gluteal Nerve arises from the sacral plexus, ti-om the fifth lumbar, and first, second and third sacral nerves, and 1. connected with the small sciatic; it is the nerve of supply to the gluteus maximus. . , , , . i The Great Sciatic Nerve (Fig. 62, 16) is the largest trunk of the sacral plexus, and appears at the lower border of the pyiifoi-mis or occasionally pierces the muscle; it arises from the lumbo-sacral cord and first, second and third sacral nerves. At the level of the hip-ioint it lies upon the posterior lip of the acetabulum, then i-uns upon the obtui-ator internus and gemelli, quadratus femons, and adductor magnus between the ischial tuberosity and the grea trochanter (close to the inner side of the neck and lesser t^chant, of the femru-), and becomes related posteriorly with the shaft about the middle of the thigh after disappearing beneath the ham.trm muscles. TJsuaUy this nerve gives no branches m this region, but the nerves to the quadratus and hip-joint are sometunes derived from it, instead of from the sacral plexus itself It tei-mmate. about the middle of the thigh by dividing into the external and internal popliteal nerves. . The Nerve to the Obturator Internus (Fig. 62, 0) anse^ from the upper part of the sacral plexus, from the fifth Inmbar, and fii^and rond sacral nerves, and leaves the pelvis below the p^ formis, taking the same coui-se as the jjudic vessels and ne^ • Zr the spine of the ischium, bnt lying to f^^^'l^l^.^^'-^^"^,^ winds into the lesser foramen it gives a branch to the supeiior lemeUus: and then supplies the fibres of the obturator withm the '"tTo Nerve to the auadratus (Fig. 62) arises fi-om ^-tei-ior surface oI L sacral plexus, and passes with a branch from he :Siic artery beneath ^^--t^^^^^ ^ quadratus and inferior gemellus, it lies u^^aiu hip-joint, to which it gives a branch.

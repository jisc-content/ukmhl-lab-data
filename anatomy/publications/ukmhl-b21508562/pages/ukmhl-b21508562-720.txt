654 THE CEREBELLUM. lingula of tlie superior vermiform process. It is narrow in front, but broader behind, and bridges over the U2)per part of the cavitj' of the foui'th ventricle. The fourth pair of nerves aiise from the middle line of the valve close behind the corpora quadiigemina (Fig. 310,15), and a small mesial ridge, the frceindum, extends from its ajtex to the groove between the inferior quadrigeminal bodies. [The preparation is to be turned over for the examination of the remaining peduncles and of the under surface of the cerebellum.] The MidiJIc Peduncle (Fig. 308, 4) (processus a cerebeJIo ad lyoniem) has been already seen at the base of the brain. It is the largest of the three, and the fibres pass across from one hemisphere of the cere- bellum to the other constituting the transverse fibres of the pons Varolii, which have been ali'eady dissected (p. 629). The Inferior Peduncle (Fig. 308, 5) [jii'ocessvs a cerehcUo ad medtiUiiw) will be better seen when the foiuih ventricle is opened. The Inferior Surface (Fig. 309) of the cerebellum is divided into two hemispheres by a deep fissure, the valk'culu, at the bottom of which is the inferior vermiform iirocess.

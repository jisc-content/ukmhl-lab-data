137 THE POPLITEAL SPACE. [A vertical incision is to be made in the middle line of the limb at the back of the knee, extending for six inches above and the same fhstance below the joint. A transverse incision at each end of this will allow the skin to be fully reflected. A few branches of the smaU sciatic and internal cutaneous nerves may be found in the superficial fascia, which is to be removed in order to expose the deep fascia.] The following cutaneous stractm-es will be exposed on reflecting the skin: over the upper, part of the space a few branches of the small sciatic nerve, with the terminal branch of that nerve piercing the deep fascia opposite the knee joint, and subsequently supplying the integument on the back of the leg: the external saphenous vem will also be seen piercing the deep fascia at the lower part of the space, accompanied by the superficial lymphatics of the back of the leg. Deep or Popliteal Fascia.—This is continuous with the fascia lata, and strengthened by fibres fi-om the hamstring tendons. It stretches across the popKteal space to protect the vessels and nerves beneath, and is tense when the limb is extended, but is at once relaxed on bending the knee. [The fascia being removed, the hoUow of the ham will be brought into view fiUed with loose fat, which is to be removed to expose the popliteal vessels and nerves. The internal popliteal neive and the pophteal vessels will appear in the middle of the T^!fr;ii 1 ■"^^'^^ its outer boundary. Imbedded m the fat of the popliteal space are some lymphatic glands, and it may be noted that there are no glands in the limb vessels TL^")!' f ^^^1^*' Pff^'-^P^' o'^e with the anterior tibial vessels.

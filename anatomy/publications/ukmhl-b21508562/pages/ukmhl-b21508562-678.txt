THE SPINAL CORD. 612 It is tliickeiied opposite the anterior median fissiu-e to form the linea sphudens. The Ligamenta Denticulata (Fig. 290, i6) are found on each side of the cord, between the anterior and posterior roots of the nerves. They comprise a series of twenty-one or twenty-two serra- tions, connected with the pia mater between the anterior and posterior nerve roots, and with the inntr surface of the dui'a mater midway between the apertui'es of exit for the nerves, each denticulation being covered by a funnel-shaped sheath of arachnoid. They serve to sling the cord and secure it from shocks. The Anterior Spinal Arteri/ and the two Fusterior Spinal Arteries may be traced upon the cord, if well-iujected. They are branches of the vertebral arteries, the ante- rior being formed by the junction of a branch from each side (p. 619)- The arteries ramify in the pia mater, anastomosing with the spinal branches of the vertebral, iuter- costal, lumbar, ilio-lumbar and sacral vessels, which enter the vertebral canal through the ■p&vt of spinal cord and membranes, are removed on the left side (from Fig. 290.—Fourth ventricle and upper The posterior roots of the nerve Hirschfeld and Leveille). 1.

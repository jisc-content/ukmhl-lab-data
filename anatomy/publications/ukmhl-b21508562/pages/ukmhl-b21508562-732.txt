SiuToiinding the ii'is is the annular Ciliary Muscle (Fig. 315, 8), composed of imstriped fibre and having a grey ajjjjearance. The muscle lies beneath the ciliary processes and is connected anteriorly with the sclerotic coat, close to its junction with the cornea. It consists of both radiating and circular fibres. The radial fibres arise fi'om the junction of the cornea and sclerotic, and from the marginal fibres of the membrane of Descemet around an annular Fig. 317. sinus called the canal of Schlemm (Fig. 315, 5); and spread out to become attached to the outer surface of the ciliary processes, as far back as the anterior limit of the choroid at the ora serrata. The circular fibres form a ring around the margin of the lens. It is doubtful whether these are not continuous with the radial fibres (Fig. 317). The mode of action of the ciliary muscle is still imcertain. There is no doubt that it is the chief or sole agent in effecting the accom- modation of the lens to near vision, and it is usually behoved that by drawing forward the suspensory hgament, with the posterior part of the ciliary processes, it lessens the tension upon the elastic lens substance, and so allows that body to become more convex. It is however possible that the circular fibres may aid this effect by directly compressing the margin of the lens. I Fig. 317.â€”Section of ciliary muscle (after Jevans) fibres of the ciliary a.

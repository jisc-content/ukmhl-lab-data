THE SOLE OF THE FOOT. 1()8 Fis. 83. The Adductor Transversus Hallucis (Tl•an^sversus pedis) (Fig. 83, lo) is of variable size, and consists of three or foiu' small bundles, which arise from the plantar transverse metatarsal liga- ment over the heads of the three or four outer metatarsal bones, and separate the tendons and nerves from the interossei and yessels. It is inserted into the outer side of the first jDhalanx of the great toe, with the adductor obliquus and part of the flexor brevis hallucis. Actions.—The flexor brevis, abductor, and adductores hal- lucis act together in flexing the jiroximal jihalanx of the great toe ; the adductors draw the toe towards the middle line of the foot, the abductor in the oppo- site direction. All help to main- tain the plantar arch. The flexor brevis hallucis is supplied by the internal plantar nerve, the other muscles by the external plantar nerve. The Flexor Brevis Minimi Digiti (Fig. 83, 8) arises from the under surface of the pro- jecting base of the fifth meta- tarsal bone and from the sheath of the peroneus lougus, and is inserted into the outer side of the base of the first phalanx of the little toe with the abductor.

431 THE LACHRYMAL APPARATUS. Fie. 210. small probe inti-oducecl verticallj' thi-ough the piuictuin may after- wards be made to pass horizontally along the aiiailicttlus into the lachrijmnl sac (12). The lachrymal sac, situated in the groove in the lachrymal bone between the tendo oculi in front and the tensor tarsi muscle behind, is a deHcate fibrous receptacle, wider above than below, and continuous inferiorly with the nasal duct. It is lined with mucous membrane having a ciliated epithelium. The cajm- liculi may be opened up upon the probe with a fine-pointed pair of scissors, when a good-sized probe may be readily introduced into the sac, and pushed down into the nasal duct and inferior meatus of the nose. If the upper lid is everted over a probe, the conjunctival Lining wlU be seen, with the subjacent Meibomian glands run- ning to the free margin in parallel rows. Within the lacus lachi-ymabs is a red- dish body, the carun- cida htchrymalts (8), .containing modified sweat folhcles and sebaceous glands, and covered with a few small haii-s. Exter- nally to the caruncle is a minute semilunar fold of conjunctiva, called the plica semi- hmaris (7), the re- presentative of the membrana nictitum of birds, crocodiles, and Pig. 210.-The piniia and its muscles (from Wilson, after Arnold). 1. 1.

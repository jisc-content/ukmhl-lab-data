376 POSTERIOR TRIANGLE OF NECK. The Posterior Triangle of the Neck. [In order to dissect the posterior triangle, the blocks beneath the head should be removed, and the head drawn downwards and to the opposite side and secured with hooks. The shoulders are to be raised to a convenient height by blocks beneath the scapuliB, and the arm di'awn down, and if possible secured in that positioih ihe side of the neck is thus put fully on the stretch, and probably the external jugular vein distended with blood wiU be seen beneath the One incision is to be carried from the back of the pinna to the clavicle near its inner end, and another from this pouit along the whole length of that bone; a thii-d incision is to be made (if neces- sary) transversely from the pinna to the occiput, and the flap ot skin is then to be reflected backwards. The dissection should be begun at the inferior angle, the dissector of the rujM side standing by the shoulder, and the dissector of the left side at the head, ot the subject.] Beneath the skin is the superficial fascia, beneath wHch ^vill be found the platysma. The fibres of this muscle may be cleaned at once while removing the skin, and care must be taken, as soon as its upper border is reached, to keep close to the skin, or the super- ficial nerves may be injured. The superficial veins are beneath the platysma. . , • i The Platysma Myoides (Fig. 185, 6) is only seen m its lower part, the rest will be found in the dissection of the antenor ti-iangle Fie 184 -Superficial dissection of the head and neck (from Machse's ^' Surgical Anatomy).

393 THE RECTI MUSCLES. Fig. 193. The remniniug Recti Muscles (Fig. 193) are seen below, and to the inner and outer sides of, the optic nerve, and are named accord- ingly, inferior, internal., and external. Tkej arise by a common tendinous origin (ligament of Zinn), which is attached round the uiiper, inner, and lower sides of the optic foramen, and then stretches across the inner part of the sphenoidal fissiu-e as far as a prominent bony tubercle on its lower margin. The ex- ternal rectus, the sti-ongest, is fixed partly to this tuber- cle, blending with the in- ferior rectus, partly by another head which arises fi'om the upper margin of the si^henoidal fissure, and blends with the superior rectus. Between these two heads is a tendinous arch, which gives passage to the oThtri^lc" '"'^^^ the scleiotic coat, a quarter of an inch behind the cornea. All of these mi^cles are ensheathed by processes of the capsule of Tenon.

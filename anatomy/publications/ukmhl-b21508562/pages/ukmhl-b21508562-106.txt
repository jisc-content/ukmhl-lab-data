These muscles are sapphrd hy the deep branch of the ulnar nerve. Muscles of the Thumb. The Abductor Pollicis (Fig. 33, 2) is a slender muscle, and is - - ■ It arises from the annular liga- ment, and usually from the lidge on the trapezium and from the tubercle of the scaphoid. It is inserted into the outer side of the base of the first phalanx of the thumb, -with the outer half of the flexor brevis, and gives a fibrous expansion to join the side of the tendon of the extensor secundi internodii pollicis. The superficialis volffi artery com- monly runs through its fibres to join the superficial palmar arch. Its action is to abduct and flex the metacarpal bone, to flex the first phalanx, and by virtue of its expansion to the extensor tendon, to extend the ungual phalanx. It must be di\^ded to see the following:— The Opponens Pollicis (flexor ossis metacarpi polUcis) (Fig. 33, 3) arises from the ^'o;^* of the trapezium and from the annular Ugament, and is n.serted mto th. outer border of the shaft of the metacaiTal bone of the thumb.

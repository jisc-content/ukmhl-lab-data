233 DESCENT OF THE TESTIS. the iiiternal abdominal ring, and by the eighth, montb reaches the scrotum, a process of jjeritoneum {processus vafjindlis) preceding it. The looped fibres of the crem;)ster would appear to be fibres of the internal oblique daawn down by the testicle in its descent. According to Curling, a muscular band, consisting of three sets of fibres and called the r/uberiiaculuin testis, passed from the pubes to the testis, and its divisions had the following attachmentsâ€”one to the bottom of the scrotum, and one on each side of the external abdominal ring, to Poupart's ligament and the crest of the pubes (Fig. 113). By the action of these bands the testicle was drawn down as far as the external abdominal ring, but it is obvious that when it had reached this point the lateral bands must have become Fig. 114. Fig. 115. horizontal, and thus have lost all power of traction ; and the further progress ut the testis depended therefore upon the middle band, which continued to draw the gland to the bottom of the scrotum (i^'g. 114). The effect of this was to stretch tho lateral bands attached to the pubes on each side, and thus they were drawn down with the cord, in which they are probably represented in the adult by some unstripcd muscular fasciculi called by Heule the "internal cremaster." The external cremaster is formed by the lower fibres of the internal oblique, which were carried down" with the testicle in its progress (Fig. 11.5).

36 PARTS ABOUT THE SCAPULA. levator anguli scapulse is inserted into that part of the vertebral border of the scapula which is above the basal triangle at the root of the spine; the rhomboideus minor into the part opposite the basal triangle; and the rhomboideus major into the rest of the border, by means of a tendinous arch to which the muscular hbres are attached. The serratus magnus is mserted mto a special area running along the ventral sui-face of the scapula close to the verte- bral border for its whole length, but the fibres are much thicker at the upper and lower angles than in the midcUe. The smaU insertion of the pectoralis minor is attached to the inner border and upper sui-face of the coracoid process, the tip of which process gives origin to the coraco-brachialis and the short head of the biceps. [A smaU block is now to be placed beneath the lower border of the Tcamila so as to put the deltoid on the sketch, and the SmiLder^o its fibres are then to be cleaned, notice bemg taken nn^e ortwo smaU branches of the cii-cnmflex nerve which turn ? und its posteiSr border, and of a few descending acromja/ twigs f^om the superficial branches of the cervical plexus (Fig. i) which supply the skin of the shoulder.] The Deltoid Muscle (Eig. 16, 6) arises from the anterior border of the outer third of the clavicle and the adjacent portion of he superior sui-face as far as the cm'ved deltoid ridge and f^^om the tip'nd outer edge of the acromion, and the lower hp of the spme ot the scapula.

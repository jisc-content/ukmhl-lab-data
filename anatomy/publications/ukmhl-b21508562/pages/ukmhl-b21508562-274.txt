THIi ABDOMINAL WALL. 232 splits to enclose the rectus in its upper two-thirds and passes in front of the muscle below (see p. 236); wliile the lower fibres, becoming gradually more and more horizontal in their course to the middle line, in the end arch downwards to be inserted iato the pubic crest, and into the ilio-pectineal line behind the attachment of Gimbernat's ligament, blending with a part of the attachment of the transversalis to form the conjoined tendon. In the male subject, some pale muscular fibres will be found to be continuous with the lower border of the internal oblique, and to descend upon the sperm atic cord and testicle. These form the cremnster. The Cremaster (Fig. US, A) consists of a series of thin mus- cular loops united by delicate fascial tissue, spread over the spermatic cord and upper part of the testicle. It is attached extevKcdhj to the inner pai-t of Poupart's Ligament, -where it is continuous with the origin of the internal obhque, and inter- nally to the spine f\nd crest of the pubes. This musculo-fascial lamina constitutes one of the investments of the cord and testicle, and as it separates the fascia spermatica externa (inter- columnar fascia) from the fascia spermatica interna (infundibuli- form process of fascia transver- salis), it might be termed the fascia spermatica media. The cremaster is si^^plied by the genital branch of the genito-criu-al nerve. . .â€ž , To explain the formation of this muscle it will be necessary to refer to the early stage of foetal life, when the testis was situated within the abdomen and immediately below the kidney. About the seventh month of foetal life the testis passes through FigB. 113, 114, 115.-Diagran,B to illustrate the deBcent of testis and tin- foniiation of the tunica vagmahs (drawn by J. 1. tTiaj ).

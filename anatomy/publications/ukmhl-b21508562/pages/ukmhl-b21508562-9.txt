PREFACE TO THE NINTH EDITION. In preparing a Ninth Edition of this work for the press, efforts have been made to curtail its dimensions without impairing its utility, and, with this ol)ject, tlie various references to Surgery and several illustrations present in the last edition have been omitted. The coloured plates from Maclise's "Surgical Anatomy," which were placed at the beginning of the seventh edition, have now been interpolated through the volume in the desci-iptions of the regions to which they refer. The text has been carefully revised, a few additions and alterations having been effected, and the original object of the author has been carefully borne in mind, viz., to provide the student with an accurate and not too elaborate guide for use in the dissecting room, and for purposes of subsequent reference.

Beginning at the median liaie of the anterior abdominal wall, the peritoneum may be followed to the, right iliac region, where it will be found to surround the ctecum and to cover the fi-ont of the ascending colon, binding the latter to the posterior abdominal waU; it then foi-ms the mesentery ; and lastly, coveiing the anterior surface of the descending colon and the sigmoid flexure (binding the former to the posterior abdominal wall, and forming for the latter a sigmoid meso-colon), it is brought round again to the anterior abdominal wall. Either the ascending or Fig. 126. the descendmg colon or both may be sm-rounded by perito- neum, and connected to the posterior abdominal wall by a meso- colon ; but in some instances, where a contracted portion of the colon seems to possess a short mesentery, the fold completely disappears after inflation of the tube, and an uncovered portion of the waU comes into contact with the parietes. This fact probably accounts for the discrepancies between the observations of different anatomists as to the frequency of an ascending or descending meso- colon (Fig. 126). A costo-colic fold attaches the splenic flexure of the descendiu- . t5 Pig. 126.â€”Transverse section of the peritoueum at the fEniest Luiie). S.I. Small intestine. y D.C. Descending colon. ^q' A.C.

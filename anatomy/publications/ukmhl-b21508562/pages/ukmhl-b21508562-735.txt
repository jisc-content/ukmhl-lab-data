THE EETINA. 669 [The retina is best seen by looking tbrougli the viti-eous humour of an eye fi'om which the iris and lens have been removed.] The Retina (Fig. 315, g) lines the choroid coat, and is the nervous membrane of the eye. It is connected posteriorly with the optic nerve, and extends in fi-ont as far forward as the finely serrated circle corresponding to the posterior part of the ciliary processes {ora serrata), gradually losing in thickness as it leaves the nerve. Fig. 320. Beyond this point it is continued over the ciliary processes in a modified form, but without any specific nervous elements. The entrance of the optic nerve {optic disc) may be seen as a white circle, the outer side of which lies about one-tenth of an inch to the inner side of the axis of the eye. Radiating from its centre are the branches of the arteria and ve7}a centralis retina'. (Fig. 320). In the axis of the eyeball in the human eye lies a minute depres- sion, the fovea centralis or yellotu spot of Soemmering, the most sensitive point of the retina.

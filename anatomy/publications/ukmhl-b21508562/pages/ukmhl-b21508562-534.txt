470 DEEP DISSECTION OF THE NECK. nerves distinctly, the internal jngnlar vein is to be divided close to tlie jugular foramen, after its description has been read, and is to be turned down.] The Internal Carotid Artery (Fig. 229) has been seen com- mencing at the point of bifui'cation of the common carotid, usually opposite the upper border of the thyroid cartilage. It is at farst external to and then beneath the external carotid, and, bke it, is roven-d h/ the sterno-mastoid and platysma muscles, and crossed by the h^moglossal nerve, the occipital and posterior auricular arteries, and the digastric and stylo-hyoid muscles. It then lies beneath he parotid gland and to the inner side of the external carotid, and is separated from the latter by the styloid process, the stylo-pharpi- ge^is muscle, the glosso-pharyngeal nerve, and the phaiTngeal branch of the vagas. Posteriorly it rests against the sympathetac triuik and the rectus capitis anticus major, and is crossed, on the inner side and somewhat posteriorly, by the superior and external laryngeal branches of the pneumo-gastric.

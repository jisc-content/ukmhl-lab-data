37 PARTS BENEATH THE DELTOID. The Sub-acromial Bursa lines the interval between the upper pai-t of the shoulder-joiat and the under surface of the deltoid, acromion process, and coraco-acroinial ligament. It thus forms an extensive sac, the enlargement of which may be confounded with disease of the joint. The Parts beneath, the Deltoid Muscle (Fig. 16) are—the Coraco-acromial ligament, the Coracoid process with the muscles attached to it, the Sub-acromial bm-sa, the lufra-spinatus, the Teres Minor and Major, the long head of the Triceps, the head and Fig. 16. neck of the humerus, and the circumflex vessels and nerve. The tip of the coracoid process lies close to the interval between the pectoralis major and deltoid, hni is usually overlapped by the latter.

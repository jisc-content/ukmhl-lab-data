THE PALATE. 487 aperture of the air passage against the retracted base of the tongue. Lastly, the contraction of the oesophagus carries the food down to the stomach. The Palate. [The soft palate is to be stretched by inserting a hook into the uvula, and the mucous membrane is to be removed from the upper surfaceof the palate and the neighboimng bones, so as to expose the muse es above the palate and the Eustachian tube. The levator palati wiU be found passmg obliquely inwards, the azygos uvute n the median bne of the palate, and the tensor palati can be best constrictor from the hamular process, when the muscle wlU be £terLTeVf^ld.r^'^^^ th': The Soft Palate {velum pendulum palaM) is a musculo-mem- branous cm-tam attached to the posterior border of the hard palate m front, and terminating behind in a free border, to the middle of which le appended the uvida. It consists of a strong fibrous aponeurosis attached to the palate bones; a number of muscles connected with the hard palate, the base of the skull, the phar^oix and the tongue ; and a covering of mucous membrane on both its surfaces, that on the oral surface presenting a thick layer of mucous glands. From behmd forwards the soft palate comprises 1. Phar>-n- geal mucous membrane; 2. Thin attachment of palato-pharyni • ofpalato-pharyngei; 6. Tensores palati; 7. Fibrous aponeurosis- 8. Palato-glossi; 9. Oral mucous membrane with mucous glands ' The Azygos Uvulae (Fig. 236, 8) consists of a small muscular bp, placed parallel to the median bne and in close contact with it feUow of he opposite .side. It arises from the posterior na.sal ,spi e of the palate bone, and is rnserted into the mucous membrane of the extremity of the uvula. ^emuiane ot The Levator Palati (Fig. 236, 5) arises from the under surface 1 t.?

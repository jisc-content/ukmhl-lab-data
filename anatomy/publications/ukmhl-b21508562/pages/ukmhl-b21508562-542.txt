The Spinal - accessory Nerve (Fig. 231, 6) emerges from the foramen jugulare, where it is closely connected with the pneumo - gastric nerve, and may be traced to the deep siu'f ace of the stemo- mastoid muscle. The Pneumo - gastric Nerve (Eig. 231, 4) leaves the foramen jugvilare in the same sheath as the spiiial- accessoiy nerve, with which it has communicating branches. Two ganglia are fomid upon the pneumo-gastric nerve, viz., the superior or gangUon of the root, and the inferior or ganglion of the trimk (see p. 471). The ijuiujlhiu of the root is very small, and is placed hi the jugular foramen. It has minute branches of com- munication with the glosso- Ijharjnigeal, spiiial-accessory, and superior cervical gang- lion, and gives off a nxiirreid iiicin'vgeal ImiiicJi to the dui-a mater and an aurhtildr branch (.lJ-)K)7d's nerve).

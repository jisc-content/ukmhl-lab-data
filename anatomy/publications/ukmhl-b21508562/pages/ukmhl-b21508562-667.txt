It divides before its insertion iuto the sacro-lumbalis and longissimus dorsi muscles. In the loins its aponem-osis blends with the '' fascia lumborum " or posterior segment of the tendon of the transversalis abdominis muscle (v. p. 234). The Sacro-Iiumbalis or Ilio- Costalis (Fig. 286, 2) the smaller and more external of the two divisions, passes upwards and out- wards to be inserted into the angles of the six lower ribs, and is directly prolonged upwards by the two following muscles. The Accessorius (musculus accessorius ad sacro-lumbalem), consisting of muscular slips which pass /rum the angles of the six lower ribs internal to the insertion of the sacro-limibalis, to the angles of the six upper ribs. The Cervicalis Ascendens (Pig. 286, 5), ariaimj from the angles of the upper five ribs, internal to the insertion of the accessorius, and bemg inserted into the posterior tubercles on the transverse pro- cesses of the thii-d, foui-th, fifth, and sLxth cervical vertebree.

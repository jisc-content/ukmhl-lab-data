32 NERVES OF THE ARM. met with. The two profunda arteries not uncommonly arise together, and occasionally there is an axis common to all the prin- cipal branches of the brachial. Venae Comites are in close relation with the brachial artery, and receive twigs corresponding to its branches: they unite with the basilic to form the axillary vein. Nerves of the Arm. The Median Nerve (Fig. 14, 6) is derived fi'om the outer and inner cords of the brachial plexus by two roots, which embrace the axillary artery in the thii-d part of its course. The nerve afterwards lies to the outer side of the axHlary artery, and contmues in the same relation to the brachial artery for about half its length; then, crossing over (or occasionaUy under) that vessel, bes to its inner side, and continues in the same relation to the bend of the elbow It gives off no branch in the upper arm imtil it reaches the level of the interior condyle, where a smaU twig is detached for the supply of the pronator radii teres. It occasionaUy commumcates with the musculo-cutaneous nerve. ^ ■ . The Musculo-cutaneous Nerve (Fig. 14, i) arises fi-om the outer cord of the brachial plexus in common with the outer head ot the median, and lies to the outer side of the median nerve and the axillary vessels for a short distance. It fii'st supplies and then pierces the coraco-brachialis obUquely (hence called « /.erA'r«.. Cassern), and then lies between the biceps and the brachialis anticus^ both of which it supplies. It finally becomes cuteneous at h outer side of the tendon of the biceps just above the bend of the low, where it has been already seen to lie beneath the median- Nerve (Eig. 14, 8) arises from ^"^^^ brachial plexus, and lies close to the inner side of the axillai> ves et aid afterwards in a similar relation with the upper part o Ihe bSchial artery.

645 THE DESCENDING CORNU. [To see the descending cornii, the side of the bram should be freely cut away opposite the point at which the choroid plexus disappears. Tlio choroid plexus being taken as a guide, the horn can be opened along its side, and the cavity exposed by drawing the parts asunder.] The Descending or Middle Cornu (Fig. 303) takes a curved coui-se downward, behind and then beneath the optic thalamus. Its direction is at first slightly backwards and then outwards, downwards, forwards, and inwards; opening at the base of the dissected brain thi-ough the lateral part of the transverse fissure of Bichat between the gJTus uncinatus and crus cerebri (Fig. 298). It contains the following structures fi'om without inwards — (1) the eminentia col- lateralh; (2) the Miixiocampus major, terminating below and in front in the^jes hippocam-pi; (3) the fimbria OTUeitia hippocampi; (4) the dentate convolution; (5) the dentate fissure; (6) the grey matter of the upper sui'face of the uncinate gjTus; (7) the choroid plexus overlying the taenia hippocampi. In the recent state the termination of the cornu is closed by the ependyma lining the lateral ventricle and its extensions. The Eminentia Collatendis (Fig. 303, 5) is an elongated projection commencing at the junction between the descending and posterior cornua, and mnning downwards into the descending horn on the outer side of the hippocampus major. It corresponds to the Fig. 303.—Middle and posterior cornua of the lateral ventricle of brain (from Hirschfeld and Leveille). 1. Pes hippocampi. 2. Ttenia hippocampi. 3. Hippocampus major. 4.

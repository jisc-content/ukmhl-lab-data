THE LEVATOR LABII SUPEttlORIS PROPRIUS. 4>S5 unite witli its fellow iu au aponeurosis over the middle line of the nose. It is intimately connected with the skin, but glides over the superior lateral cartilages. It is probably a dilator of the nostril. The Depressor Alae Nasi (Pig. 212, 7) is a small muscle, which should be exposed by everting the lip (at a later stage) and removmg the mucous membrane. It arises txom the mji-tiform fossa over the incisor teeth of the upper jaw, and is inserted info the posterior part of the colunma and the ala of the nose. It contracts the aperture of the nostril. The Levator Labii Supe- rioris Proprius (Fig. 2ia, 9) arises from the superior maxiUa and margin of the malar bone above the infra- orbital foramen, and is in- serted into the upper hp, blending with the outer side of the levator labii superioris alseque nasi, and its inner- most fibres may be traced beneath this muscle to the back of the wing of the nose. Its action is indicated by its name. Fig. 213. Fig. 213.—Muscles of the 1. Frontal portion of the occipito- frontalis. 2. Its occipital portion. 3. Its aponeui-osis. 4.

LIGAMENTS OF THE TARSUS. 194 lined with the synovial membrane of the talo-calcaneo-scaphoid articulation. The interosseous ligaments will be seen when the jomts aic Â°^Thf Metatarsal Bones (Mg. 95, 17) are connected with the tarsus by strong dorsal, plantar, and interosseous ligaments. The dorsal, ligaments run to each metatarsal bone from the tarsal bone with which it articulates; hut the second metatarsal m addi- tion to its Ugament fi-om the middle cuneiform, has extra skps from the internal and external cuBeiform' bones, between which its base " T^'"Ltar ligaments are less regi^lar, and are united with the slips from the calcaneo-cuboid Ugament. The interosseous ligaments are short strong bands, and vary slightly in different subjects. There is always one l^etween he internal cuneiform and the second metat^irsal bone ; -^^l exist between the external cuneiform and the same metatai .al bone. diagrammatic only. 1. Tibia. 2.

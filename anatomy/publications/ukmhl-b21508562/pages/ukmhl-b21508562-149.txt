115 THE SARTORIUS. Fig. 53. into the fascia lata below the great trochanter, the fascia being split at this point to receive the muscular hbres. The muscle, as its name implies, is a tensor of the fascia of the thigh, and thereby supports and assists the other muscles of the limb, especially the gluteus maximus, by fixing theii- fascial attachments; it is also an abductor and internal rotator of the femur, and acts upon the trunk when the thigh is fixed. It is supplied by a branch of the superior gluteal nerve, which may be seen entering the deep sui-face of the muscle when it is reflected. The Sartorius (Fig. 53, 5) is the longest muscle of the body, and when dissected lies loosely upon the subjacent muscles. It arises from the anterior superior spine of the ilium, from the notch below it, and fi-om the outermost portion of Poupart's ligament; and crossing obliquely over the thigh, winds behind the inner condyle of the femur and forwards below the inner tuber- osity of the tibia, to be inserted into the subcutaneous sui-face below the junction of the head of the bone with the shaft, by a broad tendinous expan- sion, which is ijicorporated with the fascia of the limb and overlaps the insertion of the gi'acilis and semi- tendinosus muscles, a bursa intervening between them. It is a flexor of the abductor of the thigh upon the pelvis, thus helping to place the 1. 2. Pig. 53.-Mu8cleH of the anterior femoral region (from Wilson). 7. Vastus externus. B. Vastus interims. 9.

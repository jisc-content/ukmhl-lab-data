THE FEMALE PERIN>:UM. 218 piercing both layers of the triaugular ligament on each side of the dorsal vein. The Dorsal Vein of the Penis runs between the sub-pubic and triangular ligaments to join the prostatic plexus of veins. The Internal Pudic Vein receives tributaries corresponding to the branches of the pudic artery, with the exception of the dorsaUs penis vein, and terminates in the internal iliac vem. The Pudic Nerve (Fig. 102, 3) lies below the artery in the ischio-rectal fossa, where it gives ofi its hajmoii-hoidal and perm<eal branches, and ends in the dorsal nerve of the penis. The latter accompanies the pudic artery thi-ough the deep perinajal mterspace, lying to its outer side in the fibres of the compressor ui-ethree and supplying the muscle, finally piercing the superficial layer of the triangular Hgament with and external to the dorsal artery. Its com-se and distribution on the penis wlLL be seen later. The Deep Layer of the Triangular Ligament (Figs. lOo, 106) closely resembles the superficial layer in its mode of attachment to the ischio-pubic rami, but is placed higher and may be regarded as a continuation of the obturator fascia across the sub-pubic arch. It is in contact hdoic with the deep transversus permasi, and above with the fat of the anterior extension of the ischio-rectal fossa, the apex of the prostate, the recto-vesical fascia, and the antenor tibres of the levator ani. It is pierced posteriorly by the mternal pu^c vessels and dorsal nerve of the penis.'and in the middle Ime by the urethra. The dorsal vein of the penis runs between its apex and the sub-pubic ligament.

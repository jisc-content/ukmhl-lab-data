TflE EXTERNAL POPLITEAL NERVE. 139 64. The popliteus can only be seen when the inner head of the gastro- cnemius is divided near its origin and tiu-ned down. The Internal Popliteal Nerve (Fig. 64, 7) is the most super- ficial of the important structures in the ham. It is the larger diA'ision of the great sciatic nerve, and 2)asses down the middle of the space, disappearing beneath the gastrocnemius muscle. It crosses fi'om the outer to the inner side of the popliteal artery, which it accompanies to the lower border of the popliteus muscle. Its branches are (1) articular, three in number, which accompany the two internal and the azygos articular arteries ; (2) muscular to the gastrocnemius (one to each head), soleus, plantaris and popliteus; the branch of the popliteus being peculiar in that it riuis upon the posterior surface of the muscle, then turns upwards around its lower border to enter its anterior or deeper surface; and (3) the ramus commuiiicans tibialis, which lies in the groove between the heads of the gastrocnemius (sometimes beneath a few of its fibres), and will be traced in the cbssection of the back of the leg. The External Popliteal or Peroneal Nerve (Fig. 63, 2), the other division of the great sciatic, is altogether under cover of the biceps at the upper part of the Fig. 04.â€”Deep dissection of the popliteal space (from Hirsohfeld and Leveille) 1.

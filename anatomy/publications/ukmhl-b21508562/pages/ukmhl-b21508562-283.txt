INGUINAI, HERNIA. 241 of distending the infimdibuliform process; but should it force its way thi-ough the inner jDart of the triangle it would derive an additional lamina (superficial to the fascia transversalis) from the conjoined tendon. It would not, however, receive its cremasteric investment in either case until it entei's the scrotum. By dividing the fascia transversalis immediately to the inner side of the internal abdominal ring, there will be found the deep epigasti-ic artery, running with its vena? comites in a line from the middle of Poupart's ligament towards the umbilicus; and the varieties of inguinal hernia have been named external or interiml according to their relation to this vessel. It is obvious that a Fig. 119. Fascia transversalis Conjoined tendon Triangular fascia Deep epigastric artery. Internal obliqiie. Cremaster. External oblique. hernia, passing through the internal ring must be external to this artery, and heoce oblique hernia and external hernia are sjmony- mous terms. In the same way, dii'ect hernia protrudes thi'ough the abdominal wall to the inner side of the epigastric artery, and thus internal is the same as dii-ect hernia. The anatomy of the parts concerned in hernia being fully com prehended, it wiU be readily seen that the direction in which force IS to be appHed to return the protruded bowel into the abdomen- common ly called the <«x/.-must differ in the two cases; and the student should notice the effect which the position of the body and limbs has upon the tissues near tlie groin.

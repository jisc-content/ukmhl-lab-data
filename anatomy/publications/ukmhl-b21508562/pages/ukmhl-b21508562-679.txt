THE SPINAL CORD. 613 intervertebral foramina, and pass to the cord along the nerve roots. The Veins of the cord {mednlli-spinal) are small and tortuous, forming an irregular' network, but one branch larger than the rest accompanies the anterior spinal artery. They communicate with the spinal veins by branches which run with the nerves to the intervertebral foramina, and above join the inferior cerebellar vein or the inferior petrosal sinus. The Spinal Cord (Figs. 290, 293) is a continuation of the meduUa oblongata into the spinal canal, and extends from the foramen magnum to the lower border of the first lumbar vertebra. I Fig. 291. It IS from IfJ to 18 mches long, and weighs about an ounce and a half. In shape it is sub-cyHndrical, and presents two enlargements both flattened somewhat from before backwards:—the upper or hruchial mlanjement, corresponding to the five lower cervical 'and Fig. 291.- -Diagram of the tracts and columns of the spinal cord in the cervical region (Gowers). 1.

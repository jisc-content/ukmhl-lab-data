644 THE LATERAL VENTRICLES. The lateral ventricles are separated from one another by the Septum Lucidum, a very thin double layer of cerebral matter, grey externally and white within, enclosing a shut sac called the fifth ventricle, and extending between the anterior part of the corpus callosum and the fornix. It is deeper in front than behind (Fig. 310, 6). The Fifth. Ventricle (Eig. 302, 2) can be shown by cutting through the septum lucidum with a pair of scissors close to the Fig. 302. remains of the corpus callosum. It lies between the two layers of the septum lucidiun, and is deepest in fi-out. In the foetus it formed a part of the great longitudinal fissui-e, but is subsequently cut off fi-om the fissure by the development of the corpus callosum. Fig. 302.â€”Lateral ventricles of 1.

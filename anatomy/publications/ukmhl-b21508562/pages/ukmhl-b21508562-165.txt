OBTURATOR INTERNUS AND GEMELLT. 181 Fig. 60. from the inner surface of the true jielvis around the anterior two- thirds of the obtm-ator foramen, and from the corresioonding portion of the inner surface of the obtm-ator membrane. The tendon winds out of the lesser sacro-sciatic foramen, and, being joined by the gemelli, passes forwards and outwards beneath the tendon of the pj-riformis (with which it is more or less united) to be inserted in fi'ont of it into a depression at the anterior part of the ujaper margin of the great trochanter. The gemelli (twin muscles) (id, 12) are placed above and below the tendon of the ob- tiu-ator internus and are inserted into its margins and deep sur- face, but one or both may be absent; the superior arises from the external surface of the spine of the ischium and adjacent portion of the lesser sciatic notch; the inferior arises from the upper and back part of the tuber ischii, and is the larger and more constant muscle.

THE HIP-JOINT. 147 addiictors; rotation inwards by the anterior fibres of the glutei medius and minimus, and the tensor vaginse femoris. The so-called movement of extension is reaUy a restitution to the position of station after flexion, and is arrested by the tension of the iho-femoral band when the thigh reaches the vertical line in the standing position. Adduction is in like manner little more than a similar restitution after abduction, and is checked by the iHo-femoral band after about 15° of movement of the femoral axis beyond the vertical line. Flexion is very extensive, and is checked during life by the resistance of the extensors. It is o^eatiy restricted by the tension of the hamstrings when the knee is extended, and if violence be used imder these circumstances the 24 adult . 4 " '-rr T'' ^^^'^^^"^^'-^ i« li-it-l - most adults to 4o or oO" by the pubo-femoral band, but in children and acrobats the separation of the two limbs may be continued Fig. 67.—Ligaments of the hip-joint (from Sappey).

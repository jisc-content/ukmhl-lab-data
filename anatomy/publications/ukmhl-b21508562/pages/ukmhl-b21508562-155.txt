THE ADDUCTOR BREVIS. 121 iispem, behind the laectiiieus and uiJiDer part of the adductor longus and in front of the adductor magnus. It is supplied either by the deep or by the superficial branch of the obturator nerve. The udiou of the adductors longus and brevis is to some extent implied by their name, but they are also flexors and external rota- tors of the thigh. The adduction if combined with flexion can be Fig. 54. carried beyond the middle line, so as to cross the thigh over the opposite limb. The pectineus is also an adductor, external rotator, and flexor of the thigh ; and the gracilis is an adductor of the thigh, and in addition a flexor and an internal rotator of the knee. All the muscles of the inner side of the thigh are 8ii]iplied by the obturator nerve. Fig. 54. â€” Profunda artery and its branches (Bonamy and Beau). 1. Iliacus. 2. Psoas. 3.

172 THE FRONT OF THE LEG. the ligament, and are crossed superficially by tlie tendon of the extensor lougus hallucis. A similar hand between the external malleolus and the outer sui-face of the calcaneum is called the external annular ligament, and encloses the tendons of the peroneus longus and brevis at first in a single Fig. 85. sheath which, afterwards, is divided into two on reaching the peroneal tubercle. The internal annular //(/ams)?* passing from the inner malleolus to the cal- caneum has been described (p. 158). [After defining the anterior annular ligament, the fascia is to be taken from the muscles on the fi'ont of the leg, and the latter, together with their tendons on the dorsum of the foot, as well as the vessels and nerves, are to be cleaned.] The Extensor Muscles (Fig. 85) are the tibialis auticus on the inner side; the extensor longus digitomm with the peroneus tertius on the outer side ; and between the two, the exten- sor longus hallucis, appearing below the middle of the leg. The Tibialis Auticus (Fig. 85, 3) arises from the upper two-thu-ds of the outer surface of the shaft of the tibia and from its outer tuberosity: from the inner half of the interosseous ligament for the same distance; fi-om the fascia covering the muscle, and from a septum prolonged between it Fj„ 85.—Muscles of the front of the leg (from Wilson). 1.

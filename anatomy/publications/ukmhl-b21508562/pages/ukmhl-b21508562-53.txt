The loug or dutcr head, not to be fully traced at present, arises within the capsule of the shoulder-joint from the top of the glenoid cavity, and from the glenoid ligament. The Fig. 11. tendon traversing the joint and enclosed in a tube of synovial membrane, enters the bicipital groove of the humerus, and is seen to emerge from the capsular ligament and lie upon the tendon of the latissimus dorsi, and between the insertions of the pectoralis major and teres major muscles.

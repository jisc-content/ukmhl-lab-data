016 THE SPINAL CORD. unite. Tlie ganglia of tlie sacral and coccygeal nerves are within tlie sacral canal. Each spinal nerve divides into an anterior and a posterior trunk, the anterior being the larger throughout, except in the 1st and 2nd cervical nerves, where they are of smaller size than the posterior. The majority of the spinal nerves divide just outside the interverte- bral foramina, but in the first cervical, the last sacral, and the coccygeal nerves, the division takes place within the dura mater ; and the upper four sacral nerves divide inside the sacral canal, the anterior and posterior trunks emerging at the anterior and posterior sacral foramina. Each anterior branch is connected to the sym- pathetic chain by one or two slender filaments. In a transverse section (Pig. 289) the spinal cord will be found to consist of white nervous matter, enclosing two symmetrical grey crescents. The convexities of these are tm-ned towards one another and connected together by two slender commissures, which He at the bottom of the anterior and posterior median fissui-es. Each crescent terminates in front and behind by expansions called cornua. The anterior cornua are the larger, but do not reach to the periphery of the cord; while the slender posteriur cornua are closely connected with the posterior roots of the spinal nerves in the lateral fissiu-e. A small central canal (canal of Stilling) exists throughout the cord, and communicates above with the lower angle of the foui'th ventricle of the brain (Fig. 291, 7). The anterior or white commissure passes in front of this, the posterior or grey commissure behind. It is impossible for the student in his ordinary dissection to investigate the minute anatomy of the spinal cord, and he is therefore referred to works on histology for fuller details. The tracts of the white fibres in the cord, as recognised by physio- logists, are shown diagrammatically in Fig. 292.

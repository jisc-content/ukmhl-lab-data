THE BACK OF THE ARM. 42 tlie circumflex nervo run downwarclis ovor the back of tlie arm, and upwards over the lower part of the deltoid (Fig. 17). [When the strong deep fascia of the arm has been divided, the fibres of the triceps muscle should be cleaned, and a large bm'sa between the triangular posterior surface of the ulna and the skin should be noticed.] The Triceps Muscle (Fig. 17) has three heads—the long or middle, the external, and the internal. The Joikj (ii) head ai-ises from a somewhat tri- angular rough siu-face on the axillary border of the scapula immediately below the glenoid cavity, and from the adjacent capsular ligament of the shoulder-joint. It has been already partly examined both from the front and fi-om behind in relation with certain spaces (pp. 17, 'iS), and its fibres are now seen to be sepai'ated by another somewhat triangular interval from the back of the upper third of the humerus, ■until it joins the external head at the junction of the upper with the middle thii-d of the bone. The outer head (4) arises from immediately below the Yig. 17.—Dissection of back of upper arm (from Hirschfeld and Leveille). 1. Infra-spiuatiis. 2. Deltoid. 3. Teres minor. 4.

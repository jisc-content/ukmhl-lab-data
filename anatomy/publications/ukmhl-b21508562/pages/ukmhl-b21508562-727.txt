661 THE MEDULLA OBLONGATA. the ventiicle. The ninth and tenth near the inferior angle of the ventricle, the twelfth internal to these close to the middle line, and the eleventh below the 9th and 10th, and running downwards into the cord as low as the 6th cervical vertebra. The Mtdnlhi oblongata may now be seen in its whole extent. Its anterior aspect has been already described (page 630). The parts for notice on each side, enumerated from before backwards from the anterior median iissm-e, are (1) the anterior pyi'amid, (2) the hypo- glossal fuiTOw with the 12th nerve, (3) the olivary body, (4) the 9th, 10th, and 11th nerves, (5) tlie funiculus of Rolando with the substantia gelatinosa, (6) the funiculus cuneatus containing the nucleus cimeatus, (7) the funiculus gracilis containing the nucleus gracilis and enlarging above into the cl.ava, (8) the posterior median fissure, opening up into the foiu'th venti-icle by the separation of the fimicuU gi-aciles. Some fibres {superficial arcuate), emerging from the anterior median fissure, are seen to run upwards and backwards on each side over the anterior pyramid and olivary body to the posterior surface of the medulla, joining with the Eolandic and cimeate funiculi to form the rest/form body or inferior 'peduncle of the r.erehellum. When possible, as soon as the student has finished the above dis- section, he should procure another brain in order that he may make various sections of it, and so more thoroughly understand the rela- tions of the several parts. The most useful sagittal section is made in the median plane (Pig. 310), and one half of the brain may be reserved for fi'ontal sections like those represented in Figs. 304 and 306.

•242 THK ABDOMINAL WALL. body and legs extended at full length, the lower part of the abdomen is rendered tense; whilst if the thigh is flexed upon the pelvis and adducted, and the body bowed forward, the structures become relaxed, and would more readily admit of the return of the protruded bowel. Varieties of Hernia.—Them are two varieties of oblique inguinal hernia termed amgeiiital hernia and infantile or encysted hernia, the anatomy of which requires explanation. To understand these fully it wiU be necessary to refer again to the descent of the testis (p. 232). When the testicle is in the abdomen it has the peritoneum attached to its surface, and during its descent into the scrotiun it accordingly carries a fold of peritoneum down with it, so that at first a tube extends along he whole length of the inguinal canal (Pig. Ho). By a natural Pig. 120. Fig. 121. Fig. 122. process during the ninth month of foetal life, however, an obliteration of the portion of tube within the canal takes place, and thus a small sac is formed around the testis, which is called the tnmca raainalis, while a mere dimple is left in the peritoneum at the internal rin-. Thus in the ordinary condition of the parts when a hernia descends, its sac is above and quite distinct from the tunica vaginalis (Fig. 120).

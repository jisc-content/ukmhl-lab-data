318 THE PELVIS. from the anterior wall of the bladder. It covers the upper surface of the levator ani and coccygeus, and is reflected from these upon the prostate, bladder and rectum, and upon the vagina in tho female, forming the true ligaments of the pelvic viscera. 3 The ischio-redal or anal fascia is a thin membrane covenug the outer or perinajal surface of the levator ani, and is derived from the inner aspect of the obtui-ator fascia (Fig. 160, lo). The deep layer of the triangular ligament, which has been pre- viously described, stretches across the pubic arch, and is formed by the obturator fascia. , . ■■ • <. i The ischio-redal fossa is an interspace between the ischio-rectal and the obturator'faaciee. It is bounded above by the angle of divergence of the two fasciae, and sends a forward extension above the perineal ledge nearly as far as the pubic bone, and a posterior extension over the great sciatic ligaments {v. p. 206). rOn the left side, the obturator fascia and the triangular Ugament , aii to t separSed from their bony attachments, and the ischial ^niiie is to be cut off with bone-forceps. , • . ^The innominate bone is then to be sawn through in_ front Gxternallvto the symphysis, the cut passing through the hoiizontal S dScending rami of the os pubis, and behind through the sacro- mac svncWrosis.

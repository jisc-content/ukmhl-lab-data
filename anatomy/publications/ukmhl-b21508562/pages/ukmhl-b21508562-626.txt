560 THE THORAX. keeps tlie latter closed up to tlie end of the ' systole' or contraction of the ventricle. The shortenmg of the musculi papillares during the contraction of the ventricle compensates for the approximation of the ven- tricular attachments to the auriculo-ventricular ring, and prevents the valve-flaps fi-om being driven into the auricle by the upward pressure of the blood-stream during the ventricular systole. A fibrous ring intervenes between the muscular tissue of the heart and the aorta, and the lining membrane of the vessel is here Fig. 266. continuous with the endocardium. This arterial rmg is about a tenth part smaUer than that of the pulmonic artery. The Aortic scmihmar valves resemble those of the pulmonaiy artery but are more fully developed, and the corpora Arantu axe better seen than on the right side. The aortic valves occupy a position the converse of those of the pulmonary artery, viz., one in front and two behind (Pig. 266). â€¢ 14. The sinuses of VaJsaha are deeper than those on the right side. Fig. 266.-A section of the heart at tl^e level of the valves, seen from above ^ (from Sibson's Medical Anatomy). P. Pulmonary artery.

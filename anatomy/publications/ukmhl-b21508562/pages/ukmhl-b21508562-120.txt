THE WlllST JOINT. 90 Fig. 41. bond between tbe shafts of the bones of the fore-aim, its fibre, running for the most part obliquely downwards from the radius to the ulnt, but some in the opposite direction. It is attached to the sharp interosseous borders of both bones, a space beuig left above, between it and the oblique ligament, for the passage of the posteiioi interosseous vessels. The membrane is pierced below by the anterior interosseous artery, and one or two of its branches (Fio-. 42, 4). The Oblique lu/ammit (Fig. 40, 6) is an inconstant band, runnmg from the outer side of the tuberosity of the uhia to the radius below the bicipital tubercle. Its direction is there- fore the reverse of that of the principal fibres of the interosseous membrane. The Wrist Joint. The term "wrist joint" is somewhat loosely applied by anatomists, and may be taken to signify either the radio-carpal joint or the whole of the articulations into the foi-mation of which the carijal bones enter. j n a The Radio-Carpal Joint is a modifaed ginglymus admitting of flexion and exten- sion with some lateral and rotatory move- ments, and has anterior, posterior, and two lateral ligaments. The Anterior and Posterior Ligaments (Fi<. 42, 7) are broad bands attached above to the front and back if the lower end of the radius, and below to the front an^^^^^^^^ « the first row of carpal bones, blending with the hgament. the carpus. ■ . s • xr^pi. The External Lateral Ligament (Fig. 42, 3) is a t^J'^ /^'^ attached to the styloid process of the radius, and to the outer .ide of the scaphoid and trapezium The Internal Lateral Ligament (Iig- ^) ulna the external, and is attached to tho styloid l--^^;^^^;^^^ and to the cuneiform and pisiform bones and antenoi anniUar ligament.

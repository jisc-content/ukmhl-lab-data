Fie. 82. each of these bifiu'cates at the roots of the toes, and they thus supply the outer side of the great toe, both sides of the second and third toes, and the inner half of the fourth toe. The fii'st digital branch also supplies the flexor brevis hallucis, the second supplies the fii'st lumbrical, and the fourth is jouied by a twig from the external plantar nerve. The External pjlantur nerve (3) crosses the foot with and in fi'ont of the external plantar artery, giving branches to the abductor minimi digiti and accessorius in its coui'se. At the outer border of the accessorius it divides into superficial and deep portions; the deej) accompanies the arterj', and will be seen in a later dis- section. The superficial portion gives cutaneous branches to the outer part of the sole, and divides into two digital branches, one to the outer side of the little toe,â€”and fi-om this commonlj'- are derived branches to the flexor brevis minimi digiti and the interossei of the fourth space; the other bifiu'cating to supply the contiguous sides of the Uttlo and fourth toes, and to communi- cate with the internal i^lantar. A slender branch of com- munication between the internal and external plantar nerves may sometimes be found.

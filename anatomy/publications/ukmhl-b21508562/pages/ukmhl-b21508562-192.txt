The artery has two venai comites, which join those of the anterior tibial artery to form the popliteal vein. The Branches (Figs. 72,73) of the posterior tibial artery are (1) pero- neal; (2) muscular; (3) medullar^^ to the tibia; (4)communicating; and (5) internal calcanean. I. The Peroneal (Fig. 72, i8), always of considerable size and sometimes larger than the pos- terior tibial, comes ofE about two inches below the popliteus. It lies at first between the tibialis posticus and the soleus, but afterwai-ds passes into the fibres of the flexor haUucis, and runs close to the inner border of the fibtda almost as far as the lower end of that bone. In this part of its coui-se it gives mm- cnlar branches, and the meduUarii artery to the fibula, which has a downward direction; i.e., runs from the knee-j oint. It then gives a jijg, 73.—Anastomoses of tibial arteries- Anterior tibial recurrent. Popliteal. Posterior tibial, giving off muscular and medullary branches.

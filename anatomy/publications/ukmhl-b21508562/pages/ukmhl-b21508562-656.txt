590 THE THORAX. A synovial membrane exists between the facet upon each of the transverse processes of the ten upper thoracic vei'tebrse and the articular tubercle of the corresponding rib. The anterior extremity of each rib has a hollow into which the costal cartdage fits, the two structures being firmly united by the periosteum. Chondro-Sternal Articulation.—^The cartdages of the ti-ue ribs fit into depressions on the side of the sternum, and are attached by anterior and ijosttrior ligaments. A band attachuig Fig. 280. Fig. 281. the seventh rib to the xiphoid cartilage is called the costo-xiphoid ligament. The fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth cartilages are connected to each other by fibrous bands. Synouial membranes.—The first costal cartilage is continuous with the sternum, and has no synovial cavity.

23 LA.TISSIMUS AND TERES MUSCLES. Fig. 7. liisrrtions of the Latissimns Bvrsi and Teres 3£aJoi:—The upper part of the latissimiis winds over the lower angle of the scapula, which it envelopes in a sort of fold, and ends in a broad, thm tendon, which passes in fi'ont of the teres major to be inserted into the bottom of the bicipital groove of the humerus. As ui the case of the lower portion of the pectoraUs major, the fibres of the muscle are twisted so that those which were highest at their origin are lowest at their insertion, and vice versa; it is the narrowest .of the three tendons inserted into the bicipital groove. The teres major passes behind the tendon of the latissimus dorsi, and is inserted into the inner or posterior edge of the bicipital groove oppo- site the pectoralis major, being separated by a bm-sa from the insertion of the latissimus. Opportunity should be taken, when the clavicle is divided by the dissector of the neck, to trace the axillary nerves to their origins and to study the brachial plexus, the description of which is given with the " Posterior Triangle."

MANUAL OF PRACTICAL ANATOMY. INTRODUCTION. By Practical Anatomy is meant the study of Anutomy by dissection of the dead body, in conti-adistinction to Descriptive Anatomy, taught by lectures, diagi-ams, and preparations. In dissecting, there are four principal objects to be constantly borne in mind by the student :^lst. The impression on the memory of the facts of general anatomy taught in the lectures. 2nd. The study of those parts of the body more especially concerned in surgical affections and operations. 3rd. The education of the sense of touch, and of the hand m the use of instruments; and 4th, the education oi the eyem the knowledge of the several structures of the body, in vanous positions, and under vai7ing circumstances. It is to assist the student m these requirements that the following work i^ designed; and every effort has been made to present the-facts of Anatomy m such a manner that they may be most easily grasped by the mind and retained by the memoiy. The education of the eye IS a gradual and tedious process, but one which is certain to be satisfactorily accompHshed if the student do but use his hands properly, and therefore a few words on the manual part of dissection may not be out of place. First, as to the INSTRUMENTS requisite for dissection. A case containing SIX scalpels, two pairs of scissors, a pair of dissecting forceps, a set of chau>-hooks, a blow-pipe and a probe, will enable the student to make all requisite dissections, supposing that he is allowed the use of a saw and chisel in the dissecting-roon,. bLALPELS for dissection are made of two i)rincipal shapes â€¢ in nfl, ^f^"^^'*^ *" ^^'"^ ^^"^ b'^ck being straight- m the other both back and edge are bevelled to a point midway between the two. The latter fonn is preferable for n^ost purples'; 11

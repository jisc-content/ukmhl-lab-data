SYNOVIAL MEMBTIA.NES OF FOOT. 197 calcaneo-scaphoid joint) there is ii verj^ considerable range of motion, around an almost vertical axis passing throngh the middle of the iixterosseous ligament. It is here that nearly the whole of the ' abduction ' and ' addnction ' of the anterior part of the foot takes place, and it may be noted that the ankle-joint takes no part in these lateral motions, even dming plantar flexion. Strictly speaking, the movement is one of adduction with elevation of the inner border of the foot, and the abduction is merely restitution to the original position. The foot is adduded chiefly by the tibialis anticus, tibialis posticus, and flexor longus digitoi'um, and abducted by the peronei. The articulations between the metatarsal bones and the phalanges, and between the phalanges themselves, are similar to those in the hand. They are, however, on a smaller scale, and therefore more difficult of dissection, except in the case of the great toe, where the articular elements are well defined. Physiologically the great toe differs from the thumb in its adaptation to sustain the greater part of the weight of the body in walking, and in its incapability of opposition to the other toes.

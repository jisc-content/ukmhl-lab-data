The Lachrymal Gland (Fig. 189, 4) is about the size and shape of a small almond, of a reddish-brown colom-, and is situated in the anterior and outer part of the orbit. It is convex on its superior aspect, to fit into the lachrymal fossa in the orbital plate of the fi-ontal bone; and concave beneath, where it is placed over the eye- ball and levator palpebrse su- perioris. Its ducts, seven or eight in number, carry the se- cretion, the tears, to the surface of the conjunctiva beneath the outer part of the ui^per eyelid.

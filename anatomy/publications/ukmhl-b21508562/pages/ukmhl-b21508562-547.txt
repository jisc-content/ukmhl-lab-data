[In all prohability the carotid canal in the temporal bono will have been opened on one or both sides in making the section of the skull, but if not, this may now be done with the bone-forceps or chisel.] The Internal Carotid Artery (Fig. 281) has been already seen from the front m the dissection of the neck ; its connections before it enters the skull are given at p. 470. The artery takes a tortuous coui-se in the temporal bone and cranium, making two sigmoid tui-ns, one, the longer, in the petrous bone, and the other by the side of the sella turcica in its petrosal curve; it lies in close relation to the anterior inferior part of the inner wall of the tjTnpaimm, and in this part of its course is more or less smrounded by a plexus of nerves derived from the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic, The Ascending Pharyngeal Artery has been described at ]). 468. Its veil) opens into the internal jugular.

ADDUCTOR OBTJQUUS POLLlClS. 77 Its action is to flex and adduct the metacarpal, and so help to " oppose " the thuuib to the fingers, an action peculiar to man and monkeys. The Flexor Brevis Pollicis (Fig. 33, 4) consists of two portions at its insertion, between which the tendon of the long flexor is placed, one, the outer or superficial head, being more or less con- joined with the abductor, iind the other deej)ly placed between the addiictor obliquus and the abductor indicis. The outer arises from the lower part of the annular ligament, and is inserted with the abductor into the outer side of the base of the first phalanx; a sesamoid bone being developed in its tendon. It is usually joined by an oblique slip from the adductor obhquus. The inner head, of veiy small size, arises from the tdnar side of the base of the first Fig. 34. metacarpal bone, and is f/iscrh'tl with the adductor obliquus. It has the asjDect of a small palmar interosseous muscle. The Adductor Obliquus Pollicis (Pig. 33, 5), formerly known as the inner head of the flexor brevis pollicis, arises from the bases of the second and third metacarpal bones, the sheath of the flexor carpi radialis, and the os magnum. It is I'nserinl, with the deep head of the flexor brevis and the adductor transversus, into the inner side of the base of the first phalanx, a sesamoid bone being developed in its tendon whore it plays over the head fif the nieta- caqxil bone ; it often gives an oblique slip beneath the long flexor Fig. 34.â€”Insertion of muse a.

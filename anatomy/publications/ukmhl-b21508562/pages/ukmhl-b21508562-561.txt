495 THE NASAL FOSS^.. [The septum is to be removed piecemeal with the boue-forceps so cis to leave the mucous membrane on the opposite side untouched, ine naso-palatme nerve and artery may be seen passing- from behind lorwards to the anterior palatine foramen, and some branches of the olfactory nerve may also be detected at the upper part of the mem- brane, if putrefaction IS not too far advanced. The mucous mem- brane IS then to be detached below and tm-ned up, when theTaral cavity will be exposed.] Each nasal fossa presents for notice an inner or septal waU an outer wall a roof, and a floor.

123 THE OBTURATOR NERVE. the middle perforating artery, and when entering the foramen in the linea aspera has a direction from the knee joint. 4. The Termuial hrcowh (Figs. 55, 56) ends in the fibres of the adductor magnus, or pierces it to join with the inferior perforating and superior internal articular. The three perforating and terminal branches form a chain of anastomoses in and behind the adductor magnus. The Profunda "Vein re- ceives branches corresponding to those of the artery and ends in the femoral vein. It is sujDerficial to the pro- fmida artery throughout. Fig. 55.

Adductor brevis Middle Perforating A... Adductor Longus Inferior Perforating A. Adductor Magnus The Obturator Nerve (Fig. 57, 8) is derived from the second, third, and fourth lumbar nerves. It leaves the pelvis at the upper part of the obturator foramen with the obturator arterj', and divides into superficial and deep portions before piercing the obturator exter- nus. The siijicrfiriiil division lies upon the adductor brevis and .supplies the adductor longus, the adductor brevis, and the gracilis, giving off filaments also to the subsartorial plexus and an articular branch to the hip-joint. The deqi division supplies the obturator externus and, after passing behind the iidductor brevis, gives a branch to the adductor magnus, and sends an articidar filament through this muscle to the back of the knee. The adductor brevis is sometime.^ supplied by this division.

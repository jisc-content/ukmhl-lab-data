82 LIGAMENTS OF CLAVICLE AND SCAPULA. Ligaments of the Clavicle and Scapula. TThe muscles about the scapula are to be followed to their exact insertions and cut short; the deltoid and the remains of the trapezius must be carefully removed in order that the hgaments of the scapula and clavicle may be seen.] The Sterno-Clavicular Articulation is a double ginglymus betweea the inner end of the clavicle and the sternum and fii'st costal cartilage, and its cavity is subdivided into two parts by an Pig. 38. interarticular fibro-cartQage. The capsule is formed by avterwr and; posterior sterno-clavicdar Hgaments, and is strengthened by an; mter-elavicular ligament above, and a costo-d<ivicular or rhomboid: Fig. 38. â€”Ligaments of tbe scapula 1.

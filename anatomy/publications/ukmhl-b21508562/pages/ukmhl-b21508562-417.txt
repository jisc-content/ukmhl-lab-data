NERVES OF THE SCALP. S61 posterior aui-icular braach of the facial nerve, the auricular branch ot the vagus, the great aiuicular unrl small occipital of the cervical plexus, the great occipital from the posterior division of the second cervical nerve, and sometimes the thii-d occipital from the third cervical nerve, together with the posterior auricular and occipital arteries. It must be borne m mind that the sensory branches of the oth nerve, although chiefly important to the dissector in theii- relation to the skm, give branches to the muscles with which they f'm'trf 'T' with the motor filaments derived fiom the facia nerve. In the limbs, both sensory and motor nerves are supphed to the muscles from a single nerve trunk found' ^'ZI i ^--dilv by feeling for the supra-orbital notch, and then cuttin:. through the occip.to-frontalis at that spot.

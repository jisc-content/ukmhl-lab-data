670 THE EYE. Exainmed by the naked eye, the retina may be divided into an inner transparent layer in contact with the hyaloid membrane, colom-less during life, but greyish in the dead subject; and an outer pigmentary layer, intimately connected with the choroid coat. Under the microscope the membrane is found to consist of eight layers of nervous structures supported by a delicate connective tissue, and arranged as follows, beginning from the inner surface:— 1. The fibrous layer continuous with the optic nerve, composed of radiating nerve fibrillfe which have lost their white substance of Schwann, and are connected with the cells of the gangUonic layer.

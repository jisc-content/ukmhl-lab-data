CAVITIES OF THE HEART. 555 inter-auriciilar septum, fonned by the foetal valve of the foramen ovale. This membrane rises from the posterior margin, of the foramen about the foiu-th month of foetal Ufe, and, as it develops, giaduaUy overlaps the anterior margin of the opening, so as to form a complete valve which allows the passage of the blood from right to left, but intercepts it in the opposite direction. Afterbirth the aperture gradually becomes obliterated, but not infrequently a Fig. 264. Fig. 264.â€”Eight side of the heart laid open (from Wilson). 1. Cavity of riglit auricle. 2. Auricular appendix; in its cavity are seen the musculi pectinati. 3. Superior vena cava, opening into the upper part of the right auricle. 4. Inferior vena cava. 5.

404 THE SIDE OF THE NECK. of the bone dislocated, the fibres of the sterno-hyoid which are attached to it being separated. The sterno-mastoid (with the portion of the clavicle) is then to be turned back, being carefully separated from the fascia beneath. The spinal-accessory nerve wdl be found to pierce it at the upper part, and a branch of the 2nd cervical nerve enters the under-surface of the muscle.] Parts beneath the Sterno-Mastoid Muscle.—By the removal of the sterno-mastoid the following structures will be brought into view, which must be subsequently studied in detail. Above are seen the posterior beUy of the digastric and the stylo-hyoid; with the posterior auricular artery and parotid gland at the upper border of the digastric, and the occipital artery at the lower border of the same muscle. Lower down and posteriorly are parts of the splenius capitis, levator anguU scapulte, and scalenus medius, with the cervical nerves and Ijnnphatic glands. In front, immediately below the digastric, the spinal-accessory nerve and a branch of the anterior division of the 2nd cervical nerve will be found piercmg the deep fibres of the sterno-mastoid, and the hypoglossal nerve arching forward over the carotid vessels. The common carotid, with the mternal jugular vein external to it, and the pnemno- gastric nerve lying deeply between the two, appears m a sheath of fascia above the border of the omo-hyoid ; and the descendens cervicis nerve lies either upon or in the sheath, and forms one or more loops with the communicating branches from the cei-vica nlexus The bifurcation of the carotid wiU be seen about the level of the upper border of the thyi-oid cartilage, the mtemal carotid pasSg upwards by the side of the jugular vem, with the external carotid in front of it; the anterior branches of the latter reaching 0 W beyond the sterno-mastoid, and the superior and middle Woid veins opening into the internal .ng^Aav Near the clavi le subclavian veins.

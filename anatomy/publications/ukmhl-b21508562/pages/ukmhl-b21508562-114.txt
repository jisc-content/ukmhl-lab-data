84 THE SHOULDER JOINT. Movements of Clavicular Joints.-The sterm-clavicuM-joint is the centre lor the moTements of the entii-e shoulder girdle. It admits of motion of the clavicle forwards and backwards around a vertical axis, and upwards and downwards around an antero-postenor axis. The bone is raised, and with it the scapula and J^^erus, by the upper part of the trapezius, the clavicular head of the sterno- cleido-mastoid, the levator anguli scapulae and the ^omboids It is depressed by the weight of the arm, assisted by the subclavius, the pectoralis minor, the lower fibres of the ti-apezius, and (mdu-ectly, bylhe latissimus dorsi. It is drawn forward by the serratus magnus and the sternal fibres of the pectoralis major, and backward by the Aomboidei and trapezius. The two clavicular prnts thus share between them movements in aU directions. The movements of the acro^n^o-ciavic^dar joints are also very important. The scapula rotates around an axis passing thi-ou h the clavicular facet in the direction of the long axis of the clavicle and it is this movement which allows the forward -vement of^the arm to be carried above the level of the shoulder. The for^rd Nation causes the glenoid cavity to look -P^f^^^f^ it the humerus, and is effected by the lower digitations of the ser^l^Tagnu;, aided by the upper fibres of the trapezius; the opposite movement is due to the rhomboideus major.

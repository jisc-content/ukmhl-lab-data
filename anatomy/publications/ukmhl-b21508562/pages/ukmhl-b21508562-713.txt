647 THE GREAT TRANSVERSE FISSURE. thakmi laterally; its borders are fringed by the choroid plexuses of the lateral ventricles, and the choroid plexus of the third ventricle depends from its inferior surface. ^ The Great Transverse Fissure or Fissure of Bichat (Fig. 304) which is now opened, is the slit by which the velum Fig. 304. Fig. 304.â€”Frontal section of the brain through the transverse fissure (W. A.). The velum interpositum and choroid plexus removed. The fissure is seen between the coiTpus oallosum and corpora quadri- eemina in the middle line, and curving on each side around the posterior extremity of the optic tlialamus to end opposite the crus cerebri, between the thalamus and the gyrus uncmatus. It is continuous with the middle horn of the ventricle over the hippocampus major. 1. Longitudinal fissure. 2. Superficial white matter of hippo- campus major, terminating in the flmbriiD. 3.

The several hranches are to be thoroughly identified, and their relations to the vessels ascertained {vida Axillary Abteky) ; but the description of the majority of them is more conveniently taken at a later stage of the dissection.

It pierces the costo-coracoid membrane, and crosses the first stage of the axillary artery. The Internal anterior thoracic nerve (Pig. (3, lo) is a small branch fi-om the inner cord, which passes between the axillary ai-tery and Fig. 5. 1 Tlioracic the preceding nerve, sends a twig tmou^n m« the lower part of the pectorahs major. ,,osterioi The CiLnfle.

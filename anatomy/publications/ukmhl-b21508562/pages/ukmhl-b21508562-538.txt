474 PREVERTEBRAL REGION. The Scalenus Posticus (Fig. 230), the smallest of the three muscles, arises from a rough mark on the outer surface of the second rib, posterior to the attachment of the seraatus magnus; and is inseiied into the posterior tubercles on the transverse processes of the lowest three cervical vertebras. The scalene muscles are supplied by the cervical nerves before they foi-m the cervical and brachial plexuses. . The Bectus Capitis Anticus Major (Fig. 230, i) arues from the anterior tubercles on the transverse processes of the 3rd, 4th, oth and 6th cervical vertebr:© (thus con-esponding to the inser- tion of the scalenus anticus), and is inserted into the under surface of the basilar process of the occipital bone. The inser- tions of this and the following muscles are very generally damaged by the section of the base of the skull. The Rectus Capitis Anticus Minor (Fig- 230, 4) Hes beneath the preceding muscle, which must be turned aside to show it. It arises fi'om the fi'ont of the lateral mass of the atlas, and partly from its ti-ansverse process, and ascends obliquely inwards to be inscrferJ into the under sm-face of the basilar process of the occipital bone, „ The Eecti Autici are supplied by ?ri™erior Wches'of the first and second cervicul nerves. T^e Bectus Capitis Lateralis (Fig. 230 8) is now exposed, nlthouoh not a prevertebral muscle (see p. 4/g. The Longus'Colli (Fig. 230) lies on the front of the cervical posterior to the rectus major.

THE smE OF THE NECK. 414 The Subclavian Arteries differ on the two sides, the right beginning at the bifurcation of the innominate opposite the sterno- clavicular articulation ; and the left in the thorax at the arch of the aorta. Both arteries may be divided into three parts, of which the second and third correspond on the two sides of the body, while the cervical portion of the first jjart of the left differs but little in its relations from the first part on the right side. The first imH on the right side extends from the bifui'cation of the innominate artery, behind the ujjper border of the sterno-clavicular articulation, to the inner margin of the scalenus anticus. Its coui'se is obliquely upwards and outwards. It is related in front to the skin, superficial fascia, platysma, deep fascia, the sterno- mastoid, sterno-hyoid, and sterno-thyroid muscles ; the commence- ment of the common carotid artery, the internal jugular, anterior jugular, and vertebral veins ; the pneumo-gastric, cardiac, and phrenic nerves; and the right lymphatic trunk. The subclavian vein, if greatly distended, may overlap its lower border, but the innominate vein is below the level of this part of the artery; the anterior jugular vein crosses it transversely, but is separated fi-om Fig. 202.â€”Deep dissection of the head and neck (from Maclise's Surgical Anatomy).

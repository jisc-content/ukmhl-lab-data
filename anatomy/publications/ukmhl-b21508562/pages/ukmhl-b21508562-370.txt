THE PELVIS. 316 be readily removed by grasping tbe tendon with tbe bone-forceps, and drawing the whole muscle out through the lesser sacro-sciatic foramen. The outer surface of the pelvic fascia will then be exposed. ] The Pelvic Fascia (Figs. 159, 160) consists of several more or less distinct planes, which are, however, in many places continuous with one another. It is attached superiorly along the posterior part of the brim of the true pelvis, but on approaching the obturator foramen it descends to be attached to the upper border of the obtui-ator membrane, and thence extends inwards to the back of the symphysis pubis; to this it is attached in two layers, which Fig. 159. are subsequently prolonged as the parietal and visceral layers of the pelvic fascia, and are here separated from one anothei by the origin of the levator ani. Posteriorly the pelvic fascia i. continuous with that covering the pp-if onnis muscle, and ?uperiorl> it is connected with the iliac fascia. The pelvic fascia may De traced down to the level of a line extending from the back ot me tlie outside (drawn by J. T. Gray). 11. Pelvic fascia. 12. Pectineus muscle. 13. Obturator fascia. 14.

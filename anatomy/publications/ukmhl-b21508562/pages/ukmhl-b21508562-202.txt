THE SOLE OF THE FOOT. 164 foot between the flexor brevis digitorum and the accessonuB muscle, and ttmiing round tbe outer border of the latter, courses inwards beneath the digital tendons towards the great toe, where it wiU be subsequently traced, joining the Fig. 81. communicating branch of the dorsal artery of the foot and completing the deep i)lantar arch. It is accompanied by the external plantar nerve (which also gives a deep branch across the foot) and supplies the ad- jacent muscles, giving a branch to the outer side of the foot to anastomose with the external calcanean branch of the pero- neal artery. The Plantar Nerves (Fig. 82). internal and external, are the branches of the posterior tibial nerve; their relation to the arteries has been mentioned. The Internal plantar nerve (5) is the larger of the two, and, after supplyii^g smaU cutaneous twigs to the sole and muscular branches to the abductor hal- lncis and flexor brevis digitorum, gives off a digital branch to the Siner side of the great toe, and breaks up into three other digital branches, which lie between the plantar fascia and the tendons of the flexor brevis digitorum; Fig. 81.â€”Deep dissection of the sole 1.

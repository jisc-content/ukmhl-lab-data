THE SOLE OF THE FOOT. 159 Fig. 75. tibialis posticus ; in the second the tendon of the flexor longus digitorum ; in the third the posterior tibial vessels and nerve; and in the fourth and most external the tendon of the flexor longus haUucis. Below the mal- leolus (Fig. 75), the tibialis posticus tendon is highest, and crosses the internal lateral liga- ment of the ankle above the sustentaculum tali to reach the tubercle of the scaphoid; the flexor longus digitonim, next in order, lams over the outer siu-face of the sustentaculum tali (but rarel_y grooves it) before disappearing beneath the sole; lastly, the flexor longus hallucis runs m a groove behind the asti-agalus and beneath the susten- taculum tab. The order then of these three tendons is here the same W above downwards as it was from within outwards at the back of the ankle. The plantar vessels and nerves are superficial to the flexor longus hallucis tendon as they approach the sole. Each of the tendons is lubricated by a distinct spaovial membrane. The Sole or the Foot. [The foot being raised on a block so that the sole may be fully exposed, an incision is to be made down its centre from tiie heel to the bases of the toes, the knife being carried at once down to the gbstenmg plantar fascia through the thick lobulated faT which is a ways found beneath the skin in this region. A transve7selncision at the roots of the toes wiU allow the skha and fat tfbe reflected to eachside If the knife is kept close to the fascia and pa-aUel to its fibres.

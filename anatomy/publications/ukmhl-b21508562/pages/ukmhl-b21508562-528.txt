464 THE SUBMAXILLAKY REGION. of the hyo-glossus, lying upon the middle constrictor and the superior laryngeal nerve, and crossed by the digastric and stylo- hyoid muscles, the communicating facial vein, and the hypoglossal nerve It is now seen in its second stage passing beneath the hyo-glossus (occasionally piercing its fibres), and running a short distance above the greater cornu of the hyoid bone between the hyo-glossus and genio-glossus, and below the termmal branch of the glosso-pharyngeal nerve. Its third stage begins at the anterior borcler of the hyo-glossus, and lies between the gemo-glossus and the mucous membrane and below the inferior lingualis, terminatmg at the tip of the tongue. Its branches are four in number:— . 1. The Superior Hyoid (13) arises in the first stage, running a ong the upper border of the hyoid bone, anastomosing ^t^^^^/^^ and with the inferior hyoid branch of the superior thyroid, and eivine; branches to the adjacent structui-es. ^ 2 The Dorsalis Ungual (3) arises beneath the hyo-glossu , and ascends to the dorsum of the tongue, supplymg the muscle and mucous membrane of the posterior part of the organ, and giving branches to the tonsils and piUars of the fauces. 3. The SuUingual (8), generally of good size, comes off uxider cover of the hyo-glossus, a little in front of the ongm of the dorsal artery and runs forwards between the genio-glossus and the siA- ?igual gland, both of which it supplies.

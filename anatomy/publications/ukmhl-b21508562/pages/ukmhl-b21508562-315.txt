THE SMALL INTESTINE. 269 is usually in close relation to the transverse colon, but occasionally the colon appears to carry uji the great omentum and jjass in front of the stomach. The spleen lies to the left of the great ciil de sac as well as behind. The cardiac orifice lies about an inch to the left of the middle line on a level with the tenth dorsal vertebra, and behind the junction of the seventh costal cartilage with the sternum in front. The pyloric orifice is usually found behind the quadrate lobe of the^liver, on a level with the first lumbar vertebra and about two inches to the right of the median line; but it extends more to the right when much distended, and is retracted towards the left when emi^ty. The Small Intestine extends from the pylorus to the junction of the CcBciuu and colon. It is an unsacculated tube, averaging about 22 feet in length, with a range of variation from ft. 15^6 to ft. 31-10 (Treves), and diminishes in the width of its calibre and the thickness of its walls from its commencement to its termination.

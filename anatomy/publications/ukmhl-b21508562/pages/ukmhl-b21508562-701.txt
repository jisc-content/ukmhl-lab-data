635 THE PARIETAL LOBE. gjTus is more complicated in fonn than the right, and represents the centre for articulate sf)eech. The ascending frontal convohition, neai'ly at right angles to its three companions, is continuous above with the superior frontal and ascending parietal convolutions, and below with the inferior frontal and ascending parietal convolutions. The under surface of the Frontal lobe, Ijdng upon the orbital plate of the frontal bone and lesser wing of the sphenoid, has been Fig. 300. Calloso iTiarc[inal. PttTdcbo occipiba1 occipital notcK. described. Its internal sui'face is formed by the me.?ial convolutions in front of the quadrate lobule (Fig. 301). The outer surface of the Parietal lobe is bounded in front by the fissure of Eolando; above by the longitudiuEiI fissure; below by the posterior limb of the Sylvian fissure, and an imaginary line contniumg its couri?e onwards from the antjlc of the latter; and behind by the external parieto-occipital fissm-e, and an imaginary Fig. 800.—Lateml view of the convolutions of the brnin (after Thane).

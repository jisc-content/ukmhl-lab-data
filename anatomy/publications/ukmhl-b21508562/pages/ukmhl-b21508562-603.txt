PART V. THE THOKAX. [Tlie axilla having been completed, the dissectors of the thorax should detach the remains of the pectorales, the serrati, and the abdommal muscles fi-om the outer sm-faces of the ribs and theu- cartilages, and dissect the external intercostal muscles.] The External Intercostal Muscles (Pig. 116, 4), eleven in number on each side, are placed between the ribs, and are attached to the lower and upper borders and outer surfaces of the adjacent bones, the fibres running obliquelj^ downwards and forwards. They extend fi'om the tubercles of the ribs to the line of junction with the costal cartilages ; and beyond this point, prolonged to the anterior extremities of the intercostal spaces, is a tliiu fascia, the fibres of which take the same direction as those of the external intercostals. [By removing the external intercostal in one space, the outer suriace of the internal intercostal muscle will be exposed, and the mtercostal artery will be found with its accompanying vein and nerve The artery Kes at first at the lower border of "the rib bound- ing the space above, and ends by anastomo.sing with the corre- sponding intercostal branch of the internal mammary, which runs outwards m the substance of the internal intercostal muscle. A small collateral branch of the artery will be found at the lower part of each space between the muscles, anastomosing with a corresponding branch of the internal manunaiy.] 1 o The Internal Intercostal Muscles (Fig. IKJ, 5) take a direc- tion opposite to that of the external muscles, and can now bo seen only m front, where the external muscles are wanting, but wUl be lully exposed from within the thorax. Each muscle in the typical spaces extends from the ano-les of the nbs to the anterior extremity of the space. It is attached to the superior border of the lower rib, close to the attachment of tHe external intercostal, and to the inner margin of the vascular groove of the upper rib, encroaching ui.on the inner siu'faces of

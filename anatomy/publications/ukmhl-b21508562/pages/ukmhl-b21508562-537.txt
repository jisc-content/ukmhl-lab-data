PREVERTEBRAL REGION. 473 231, 12). Its branches are very slender and lie in a delicate i^lane of connective tissue, from which they may be readily isolated in a fi-esh subject. Prevbrtebkal Eegion. [The carotid arteries, with the jugular veins and the pneumo- gastric and sympathetic nerves, are to be divided at the level of the top of the sternum, and the trachea with the oesophagus is to be severed a little lower down. The neck is then to be bent forcibly backward so as to make the cut sui-face of the skull rest upon the table, and the oesophagus and trachea, with the vessels and nerves being drawn forcibly forward, the cellular tissue between the pharynx and the front of the vertebral column is to be cautiously tbssected thi-ough, until the under surface of the base of the skull is exposed The saw is now to be applied in such a way that the section will pass verticaUy downwards through both external auditory meatus, and emerge immediately in front of the anterior arch o± the atlas, leaving the anterior part of the cranium and face with the pharynx and principal vessels and nerves, and the hinder part of the skull with the vertebral column and prevertebral muscles, lins section wiU also give a very interesting view of the mulitorti Si 1"" . necessary, slices of the petrosa containing the middle and internal ear may be sawn off for subsequent study. T^he anterior part of the skull, with the pharjmx and deep vessel^ thP ,.\\TT'' ''l. ^^^^•aPPed up for subsequent examination, and mi-t oTthP tlf f'^''^ *° the vertebral column, with the posterior pait of the skull, are now to be examined.] The Scalene muscles have been seen already m part, but can now be fully dissected. The Scalenus Anticus (Pig. 230, 2) arises from the tubercle on the inner border and upper surface of the first rib (scalene tubercle) and ascends to be mserted into the anterior tubercles on the trans- verse processes of the 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th cervical vertebrae The phrenic nerve and subclavian vein wiU be found on the anterior .suiface of the muscle, and behind it lie the cords of the brachial and lower part of ^e cervical plexuses, and the subclavia!i aiTery ^'^fl?^^^ Medius (Fig. 230, 7) lies behind the subchwian -tery and the. cords of the cervical and brachial plexuses. It iiom the rough marking upon the upper surface of the firs r b 2^^>U'd into the posterior tubercles on the transverse processes of irte^^'i?^ cervical vertebra,. Li front of it lie the'subl • an ai tery and the cervical nerves, behind are the levator anguli s am^ and scalenus posticus, and piercing its outer surface are he to the rhomboids and the long thoracic nerve.

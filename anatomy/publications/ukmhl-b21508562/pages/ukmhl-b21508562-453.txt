THE CAPSULE OF TENON. 395 gives off six wKjiiHtl jiroresses, one to each muscle. That to the superior oblique covers only the reflected tendon, and terminates at the pulley; the others fonn each a loose sheath for the tendon, but blend intimately with the perimysium of the muscular belly and become less and less demonsti'able as they approach the origin. With each of the vaginal processes, except that to the superior obUque, is connected a process of fixatkw, which is directly or Fig. 194. 15- mdn-ectly attached to the bony waU of the orbit in such a manner as to hmit the contraction of the muscle and alter somewhat its line oi action. These secondary processes are of considerable strength and contam unstriped muscular fibre. The external rectus process IS attached to the outer margin of the orbit, the internal rectus process goes to the lachrymal crest, while those of the superior and la^enor recti pass to the orbital border of the tarsal cartilages, and only mdn-ectly to the orbital margin through the tarsal ligaments Fig. 194.—Frontal !• Supra-trochlear nerve. 2.

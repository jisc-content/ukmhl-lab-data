FRONT OF THE UPPER ARM. 26 external condyle of the humerus and supplying the skin on the posterior and outer part of the fore-arm as far as the wrist. The cutaneous hranches of the circumflex nerve emerge from beneath the posterior border of the deltoid, and supply the integu- ment over the lower third of that muscle. The Deep Fascia of the arm is sufficiently seen in following the superficial vessels and nerves. It is continuous with the fascia of the axiUa and fore-arm, and is attached to the supra-condylar ridges of the humerus, forming Fig. 10. the external and internal inter- muscular septa, which give attachment to muscular fibres. The intmial interniiucukir sep- tum is the stronger, and is pierced by the ulnar nerve and the iufeiior profunda and anas- tomotic arteries. The txternal is pierced by the musculo-spii-al nerve and the terminal branch of the superior profunda artery.

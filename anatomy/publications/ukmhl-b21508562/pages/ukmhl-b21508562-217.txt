THK INTEROSSEOUS MUSCLES. 179 ligaments pass the tendons of the interossei as in the hand (see p.^79). The Interosseous Muscles are seven in number, viz., four dorsal and three plantar, the former being between the bones, while the latter He rather on theii- under surfaces. The dorsal are bipenni- form muscles, and are seen on both surfaces of the foot; the plantar ai-e seen only on the sole. The four dorsal interossei (Fig. 87) arise from the adjacent sides of the metatarsal bones in nearly the whole length of their shafts, Fig. 87. 88. and are inserted into the bases of the first ],halangoH in such a Planner as to abduct from an imaginary lino prolonged through the second metatar.sal bone (instead of the third as in the hnnd) and into the exten.sor tendon over the proximal phalanx Thus the 1st IS m.sertedinto theside of the first phalanx of the Becond_toe^ the oiUer side of the first phalanx of the >'ig. 87.—The dorsal interosHeous muscles of the foot r,T T f!™ v\ Tl,o « refer to the seven synovial n,embnuuls.

Its narrow lateral borders give attachment to the broad and utero-sacral ligaments, and from its superior angles run the oviducts, the ligaments of the ovary, and the round ligaments. The cervical portion msij be divided into three zones, an upper, supravaginal; a middle, corresponding to the area of vaginal attachment (which is liigher posteriorly); and a lower intravaginal segment, the oa uteri. The relative dimen- sions of body and neck differ at different periods of life. In the child the cervLx is the longer, in the virgin the two parts are about equal, but after partmition the body is left nearly twice as lono> as the cervix. ' The caMy of the body is triangular in shape, with the .-ipex downwards at the os internum, and the extremities of the base corresponding to the orifices of the oviducts or Fallopian tubes, it IS Imed by a smooth mucous membrane, on the surface of which open numerous tubular glands, and it has ciliated epithelium The nn^y^fh, rerrir. is fusifonn.

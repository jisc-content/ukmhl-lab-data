CAVITIES OF THE HEART. 569 which receives the aortic valves when distended in ' diastole.' The muscidi papiUares are iu two groups, and are much larger than those of the right ventricle, and the rest of the carnese colunuiEe are more numerous and more comjolex in theii' arrangement than on the right side. The auriculo-venti-icular ring is about five-sixths of the dimensions of that of the tricuspid opening (Fig. 267). The mitral valve acts during conti-action of the ventricle (systole), and prevents the regurgitation of blood into the auricle. Fig. 265. The anterior division of the mitral valve prevents the blood from flowmg into the aorta until the ventricle is fully distended, and able to contract forcibly on its contents; and the pressui-e of the blood in the mtervalvular space, on the anterior flap of the mitral valve Fig. 265.-Left side of the heart laid open from behind (from Wilson). 1.

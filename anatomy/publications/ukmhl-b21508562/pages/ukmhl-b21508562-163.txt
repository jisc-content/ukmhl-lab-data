129 THE GLUTEUS MEDIUS. Fig. 59. and a third over the tuberosity of the ischivim. The hitter is sub- cutaneous when the thigh is flexed, but is covered by the muscle diuing extension. The Parts beneath, the Gluteus Maximus (Figs. 60, 61) can now be seen, covered by loose cellular tissue, which is to be re- moved. They are from above downwards:—1, gluteus medius; 2, superficial branches of the gluteal vessels; 3, pyriformis muscle ; 4, sciatic vessels and nerves (great and small) and inferior gluteal nerve; 5, jDudic vessels and nerve, and nerve to obtui'ator inter- nus; 6, tendon of the obturator internus with the gemeUi muscles above and below it; 7, the tendon of the obtm-ator exter- nus, usually concealed by the inferior gemellus and quadratus ; 8, quadratus femoris and upper border of adductor magnus; 9, great sacro-sciatic ligament; 10, tuber ischii and muscles attached to it; 11, terminal branches of internal circiun- flex vessels, ajipearing above and below the quadratus femoris; 12, the upper end of the femur with the vastus externus. [These structures are to be cleaned as far as possible at once, and will be examined in succession. In order to clean the muscles, the thigh must be well rotated mwards, and for the gluteus medius it must be crossed beneath the opposite limb. Care should be taken to preserve an an_astomo.sis of arteries between the tuber ischii and great trochanter.] The Gluteus Medius (Fig. 59, i) avMes from an area upon the dorsum ilii bounded by the superior and middle curved lines and the anterior fom--fifths of the external Pig. 59.-MuHcleB of the posterior femoral and gluteal region (fro„> Wil.on) 1.

19(j SYNOVIAL MEMBRANES OF FOOT. The Btrone interosseous Uyament connecting the under sm-face of the astragalus and the upper suiiace of the os calcis will now be seen occupying the deep groove between the two articulations m each bone Two Merosseoas ligaments, the i^ernal calcaneo-cuboid and the external caUaneo-scaphoid, will also be seen, when the astragalus is displaced, passing from the upper border of the greater process of the OS calcis to the cuboid and scaphoid bones respectively. The -Ith synovial membrane (iv) belongs to the calcaneo-cuboid articulation, and when it is opened, the pecuUar manner m which the two bones are locked together will be seen. The oth synovial membrane (y) is common to the scapho- cuneiform, inter-cuneiform, and cubo-cuneiiorm articulations and to^he oints between the middle and external cuneifoj-m and the con-esponding metatarsal bones (vii), and is also prolonged into Te Sulations between the second, thii-d, and fourth metatarsal ^'Tteross'eous Hgaments wiU be found between the scaphoid and cuW bones; between the internal and middle cuneifonn bones between the middle and external cuneiform bones ; and between the external cuneiform and cuboid bones. .

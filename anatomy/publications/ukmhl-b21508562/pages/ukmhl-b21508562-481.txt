417 THE VERTEBRAL ARTERY. the subclavian vein close to its union with the internal jugiilar; and the internal jugular vein, overlapping the common carotid artery, is less extensively related to the subclavian artery than on the right side. The Branches of the first part of the subclavian artery are (1) Vertebral, (2) Internal Mammary, and (3) Thyroid Axis. The Superior Intercostal artery arises from the first part of the sub- clavian on the left side, but on the right is usuaUy a branch of the second part, and is concealed by the inner border of the scalenus anticus. 1. The Vertebral Artery (Fig. 203, i) is seen now in only a small part of its course. It arises fi'om the posterior part of the upper border of the subclavian (occasionally from the aorta on the left side), and runs upwards in fi'ont of the transverse process of the 7th cervical vertebra, Ij-ing in an interspace between the scalenus anticus and the longus colli muscles. In front of it are the inferior thyroid artery, the middle cervical gangHon, two minute branches from the mferior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic, and the internal jugular and vertebral veins. It enters the foramen in the transverse process of the 6th cervical vertebra, and passes thi'ough the vertebrarterial foramina in all the vertebrje'above, inclining outwards to reach its passage on the atlas, then winding inwards upon the atlas to enter the foramen magnum and supply the brain It IS about 2 inches in length between its origin and the point at ^^ch It enters the vertebrarterial canal. In the neck it gives off spmal branches, which enter the spinal canal through the 1. Auricular anastomosis. 1* Posterior auricular. 2. Anterior cerebral. 3. Occipital. 4. Anterior communicating. 5.

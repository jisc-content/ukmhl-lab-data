" The Bladder (Fig. 167j.-The p,rito,ml coat of the bladder has been already dissected and the relations of the viscus have been desci-ibed (p, 320). The muscular coat consists of three layers, external, middle, and internal. The external layer, sometimes known as the detrusor urime consists chiefly of longitudinal fibres which are best seen on the anterior and posterior surfaces of the yiscus. Those placed in frout pass m the anteiior true ligaments, and are attached to the posterior surface of the pubic bones and symphysis {vcs/co-pubic musch). The posterior fibres join the posterior part of the prostate. The middle layer consists of plexiform and cii-cular fibres, which form the sphincter vesicce around the neck of the bladder, and are closely connected with the prostatic sphincter. They decussate in their distribution over the greater part of the bladder The udernal layer is longitudinal and plexifoiin : it is continuous with the longitudinal fibres of the m-ethra, and is joined by the fibres of the ureters, which meet in the middle line and are spread over the trigonum (Ellis). ^ Beneath the musctUar coat is a quantity of loose submucous connective tissue.

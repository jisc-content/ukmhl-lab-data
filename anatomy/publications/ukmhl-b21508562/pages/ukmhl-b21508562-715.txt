THE THIRD VENTRICLE. 649 [The velum intevpositum is to be reflected, and the two small choroid 2^l<'-ruses of the third ventricle will be seen on its under surface near the middle line. The third ventiicle is now exposed, and Fig. 30G. behind it the corpora quadrigemina and the pineal gland. The latter is very liable to be removed with the velum interpositum, unless it is carefully dissected.] The'Third Ventricle (Pig. 307) is the mesial interspace between the two optic thalami: these, with the peduncles of the pineal gland, foiining its lateral boundaries. Its roof is formed by the fornix and velum interpositum. Its floor corresponds to the optic Fig. 306.â€”Transverse vertical section of the cerebrum made immediately behind the corpora albicantia (H.

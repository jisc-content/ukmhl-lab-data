235 THE TRANSVERSALIS MUSCLE. of Poiipart's ligament. Its tendon of insertion passes to the linea alba behind the rectus, from the ensiform cartilage to about the junction of the middle and lower thirds of the muscle, and in front of it below this point as far as the pubes, being inseparably united with the aponeurosis of the internal oblique ; and into the pubic crest and ilio-pectineal line, forming with the internal oblique the conjoined tendon. Action.—The transversalis is essentially a contractile abdo- minal belt, and has little or no influence upon the movements of the trunk. The obhqui aid the transversalis in constricting the abdominal cavity, and are also direct and lateral flexors of the lumbar portion of the ver- tebral column; and all these muscles aid in expu-ation, partly by drawing down the ribs and sternum, and partly by upward pressure of the diaphi-agm through the medium of the vis- cera. They are hence muscles of locomotion (except the trans- versalis), of abdominal con- striction, and of expiration. Pig. 116.

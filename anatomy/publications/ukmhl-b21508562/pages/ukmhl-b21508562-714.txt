INTBRTOR OF THE BRAIN. 048 intorpositum enters the brain. It is exposed on the undissected braiii by opening iip the interspace between the cerebrum and cerebelliun, and removing the pia mater. It will then be seen as a wide fissure, nearly horizontal in the middle, but strongly curved downwards and inwards at the sides. Its central portion lies between the coi"j)us callosum above and the corpora quadrigemina and upper surface of the optic thalamus below; while its extre- Fig. 305. mities bend each around the'correspondiug"^ optic thalamus, at first external to, and then beneath it, to terminate in the interval between the crus cei-ebri and the uncinate gyrus at the base of the brain. It opens into the descending horn of the lateral ventiicle over the hippocampus major on the outer side of the thalamus, when the ependyma closing the cornu in this situation is broken down.

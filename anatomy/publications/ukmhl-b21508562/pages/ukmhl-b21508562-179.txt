THE HIP-JOINT. 145 Fig. 66. BelaUons.—The hip-joint has in front the united psoas and ihacus and the outer edge of the pectineus, and more supei-ficiaUy he the rectus, the femoral yessels and the anterior crural nerve; behind, are the pyriformis, obtiu'ator internus, and gemelli, the obtm-ator externus and upper fibres of the quadi-atus femoris, with the sciatic nerves and vessels lying upon them close to the posterior margm of the acetabulum; above and externally, lie the gluteus mmimus and the ilio-trochanteric band; and below s.nA internaUy, are the tendon of the obturator externus and the pectineus (Fig. 65). The ligaments of the hip-joint are of two kinds, those which com- plete and deepen the socket—the transverse and cotyloid; and those which connect the two bones—the capsular and the round. The Capsular Ligament (Fig. 67 , i) is attached immediately outside the margin of the acetabulum, and to the transverse ligament above; and surrounds the upper end of the femur below. Its upper attach- ment follows the acetabular border, but extends beyond this to the anterior inferior iHac spme above, to the body of the ischium at its junction with the ilium behind, and to the body of the os pubis and obturator externus fascia in front. Its lower attach- ment passes around the femur, from the tubercle (tuberculum colli superius) along the J?t! 1° ^ """"^ (tuberculvun colli inferius) at ™ thl L rr ''^''f '^oo}.antev.

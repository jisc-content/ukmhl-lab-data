THE RETINA. 671 Tlie connective tissue on the axial side of this layer is condensed into a delicate lamina called the memhrmia Iwiitans ivteriia. 2. The (janglivnic layer consisting of nerve ceUs of spheroidal or pyriform shape. 3. The inner molecular layer, consisting of a fine network of processes derived fi-om the ganglion cells, imbedded in a mole- cular supporting material. 4. The inner nuclear layer consisting of transparent nucleus-like bodies. 5. The outer molecular layer much thinner than the inner one. 6. The outer nuclear layer. 7. The haciUar y layer or JacoVa membrane, consisting of a peculiar arrangement of tenninal structures named rods and cones. These are continuous with some fibres called the fibres of Muller, derived from the ganglionic layer and piercing the nuclear and molecular layers. The cones are present in largest proportion in the neigh- bom-hood of the yeUow spot, and in the fovea centralis constitute the only retinal structures. On the inner side of the rods and cones the retinal connective tissue is condensed into a membrana limitans externa. 8. The pigmentary layer, consisting of a single layer of hexagonal pigment cells, which were formerly considered to belong to the choroid coat. In front of the ora serrata the pigmentary layer becomes continuous with the pigment of the ciliary processes, and the other elements of the retina are represented by a layer of columnar cells. A needle passed from before backwards thi-ough the axis of the eye, would pierce the foUowrng structui-es :—1. Cornea. 2. Ante- rior chamber filLed with aqueous humom-. 3. Pupil. 4. Posterior chamber. 5. Anterior capsule of lens, with its layer of cells. 6. Lens. 7. Posterior capsule of lens. 8. Vitreous, with hyaloid membrane. 9. Eetina (fovea centralis). 10. Choroid. 11. Sclerotic. 12. Capsxile of Tenon. The capsule of Tenon and the vessels and nerves of the eyeball have been described in connexion with the orbit. «

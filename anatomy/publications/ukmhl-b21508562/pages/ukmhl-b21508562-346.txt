Its fleshy fibres unite with the tendon of the psoas, and arc inserfed with it into the lesser trochanter, and into the shaft for abovrt an inch below. A bursa lies beneath the conjoined muscle between it and the capsule of the hip, and may communicate with the joint cavity by a round apertiure between the iUo-femoral and pubo-femoral bands. The psoas and the iliacus are flexors and externai rotators ot tJie thigh and taking theii- fixed point below are flexors and rotators of the trunk upon the thigh. This is seen in dislocation of the femur downwards into the thyroid foramen, when the boaj^ is always bowed forwards owing to the tension of these muscles, ihe psoas is supplied by the lumbar nerves, the iliacus by intra-pelvic branches of the anterior crural nerve. , , , i The auadratus Lumborum (Eig. 149, 5) is the short muscle filling the space between the last rib and the crista ilii. It has its origin below, from the posterior portion of the mner lip of the crest of the ilium and from the adjacent ilio-lumbar bgament; and ascends to be inserted into the lower border of the last rib, and by three or four sUps into the tips of the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebra,. It is sometimes described as consisting o two distinct parts.

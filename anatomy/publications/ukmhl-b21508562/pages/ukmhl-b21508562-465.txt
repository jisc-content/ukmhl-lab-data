THE THYRO-HYOID NERVE. 405 wliicli it forms a loop, the ansa hypoglossi; from the ansa hyjoo- glossi are given oif braTiches to the sterno-hyoid, sterno-thyroid, and posterior bell}- of the omo-hyoid, the anterior bellj' of that muscle beingsupplied by the descendens cervicis before it joins with the ansa. The communicans cervicis is derived from the 2nd and 3rd cervical nerves, and is occasionally double. The Nerve to the Thyro-liyoid is seen coming from the hypo- glossal in front of the origin of the descendens cervicis. These two branches, together with the nerve to the genio-hyoid, are Fig. 198.â€”Muscles of the anterior aspect o figure the superficial muscles are seen, on 1. Posterior belly of digastric. 14. 2.

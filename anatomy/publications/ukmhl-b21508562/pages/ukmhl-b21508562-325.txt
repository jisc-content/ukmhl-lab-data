279 THE DIAPHRAGM. second lumbar transverse process. It gives attachment to muscular fibres above and to the fascia iliaca below. The crura or pillars of the diaphragm (8) arise from the front of the bodies and intervertebral discs of the four upj^er lumbar vertebi'JB, and usually from a mesial fibrous arch over the aorta; the right crus is the larger, and extends as low as the disc between the PiK. 141. thud and fom-th lumbar vertebra, while the left crus (lo) reaches to the third disc. All the fibres of the diaphragm are inserted into a central tendon, called from its shape the rordi/orm or trefoil tendon (i, 2, 3), but the mner fibres of the crui-a decussate with one another and form Fig. 141.â€”Under or abdominal surface of the diapliragm (from Wilson). 1.

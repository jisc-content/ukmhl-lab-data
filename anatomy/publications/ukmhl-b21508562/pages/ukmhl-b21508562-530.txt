466 DEEP DISSECTION OF THE NECK. Both the genio-hyoid and tte genio-glossus are supplied by tke hypoglossal nerve. The Stylo-maxillary Ligament (Fig. 221, 6) will be seen attached to the angle of the jaw. It is a process oi deep cervxc^al fascia, passing from the styloid process to the mner sariace of the angle of the jaw, where it is much widened. It mtervenes between the parotid and submaxillary glands, and gives origm to the stylo- ^°^The Stylo-hyoid Ligament is a narrow band passing from the styloid process downwards and forwards to the lesser cornu of the hvoid bone.

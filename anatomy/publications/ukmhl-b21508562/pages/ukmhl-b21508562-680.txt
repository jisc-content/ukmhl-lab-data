The hrarhial Fig. 29i2. enlargement gives origin to the nerves of the upper extremities, the lumhar enlargement to those of the lower extremities. The cord presents an anterior median fissure, which extends into it for about one-thii-d of its thickness, and can be opened up; a posterior median fissure, somewhat deeper, which also admits a pro- longation of pia mater, but cannot be opened; and on each side an antero-hde^-al line and a postero-laUral (jroove coiTCsponding respec- tively to the line of attachment of the anterior and posterior roots Fig. 292.—Diagram ilhistrating tlie paths probably taken by the fibres of the nerve-roots on entering the spinal cord (Schafer). a.vi.f.

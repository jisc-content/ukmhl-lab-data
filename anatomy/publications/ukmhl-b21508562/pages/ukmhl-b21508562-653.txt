[The trachea and bronchi are to be laid open from behind with scissors, and the divisions of the bronchi should be followed for a shoi't distance into the substance of the lungs. ] The Ltmgs.—The mucous membrane of the bronchial tubes is of a pinkish colour, and ha.s ciliated epithelium. Numerous mucoiis glands are embedded in the submucous areolar tissue. On tracing the tubes they will be found to become cylindrical, ' ' ' ' their ring-like form are represented by irregular the cartilages losin^ Fig. 279.—Trachea and bronclii seen from the front {modified from Aeby). 1.

358 THE SCALP. the dissection below, and across the side of the neck the proimnence of the stemo-mastoid marks the division into anterior and posterior triangles; in an injected body the carotid artery may be felt near the middle of the anterior border of this muscle. The exteraal jugular vein, if fuU of blood, will probably be seen crossmg the sterno-mastoid obliquely. After the dissection of the neck is commenced, and sometimes before in thin subjects, two important bony landmarks may be distino-uished, the prominent transverse process of the atlas below the mastoid process, and the anterior tubercle of the transverse process of the 6th cervical vertebra {carotul tuherch of Chassaignac) nearly opposite the lower border of the cricoid cartilage. It will be found to be impossible to dissect both sides of the head and neck simultaneously, and the students should therefore arrange to work together, and to take turns at dissecting and reading. The dissection of both sides of the scalp should be completed on the first day, in order that the brain may be removed on the second morniag^ The ScAiiP.

The cutaneous nerves are also to remain untouched.] Scui-jHi's trianglt is a superficial space in the upper thii-d of the front of the thigh, containing the femoral vessels and anteiior crural nerve. The base of the triangle is formed by Poupart's ligament; the outer border by the inner edge of the sartorius muscle ; the vmer border by the outer margin of the adductor longus ; and the apex by the meeting of these muscles. The space is covered in by the skin and superficial fascia and Burns's process of the fascia lata, and its floor will now be seen to be formed by the jDsoas and iliacus on the outer side; the pectineus and, in some sub- jects, a small portion of the adductor brevis on the inner side: these muscles all being- covered by their fascise. Scai-pa's triangle contains the common femoral arterj^, giving oif some small branches and bifurcating into the superficial Pig. 52.â€”Superficial dissection of tlie front of the thigh (from Hirschfeld and Leveille). 1.

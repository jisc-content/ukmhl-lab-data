eg PALM OF THE HAND, on tlie radius, transmits the tendons of the extensor communis di-itorum and .of the extensor indicis; the fiM division corre- sponds to a very slight groove on the edge of the radius (or is placed between the bones), and transmits the tendon of the extensor minimi digiti; the sixth division corresponds to the oToove at the back of the styloid process of the ulna, and ? -i.^ j.i,„ i.r.^Ar.r^ fho fi^tfiiisor caroi ulnaris.

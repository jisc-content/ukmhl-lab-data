THE SOLE OF THE FOOT 162 The sheaths of the tendons resemble those of the hand, but are smaUer Beginning over the heads of the metatarsal bones, each sheath is joined by a process of plantar fascia, and then extends to the base of the terminal phalanx "^'^^^^ - ~te â–  Fig. 80. The sheath is strong opposite the shaft of each phalanx (/fVya- mmtam vagiiiale), but thinner over the joints, so as not to impede their motion; and, when divided, will be found to be lined by a synovial mem- brane which is reflected over the tendens. Small elastic bands {vrncula vasciilosa) con- nect each tendon of the flexor brevis with the front oÂ£ the first phalanx, as in the hand. The Abductor Hallucis (Fig. 80, 7) arises horn the in- ternal annular ligament; fi-om the inner tuberosity on the under surface of the os calcis (internal to the origin of the flexor brevis digitorvim); from the plantar fascia and the intermuscidar septum between it and the flexor brevis digi- torum; and from the fascia on the inner side of the foot. The muscle ends in a broad tendon which is joined by the inner head of the flexor brevis hal- lucis, and is i,>serte<I into the Fig. 80.-Superficial dissection of the sole of Greater tuberosity of os calcis.

[The superficial vessels and nerves are to be turned aside and the muscles dissected out. The muscles are much less distinct than in Fig. 108. the male perineeum, and it is impossible to trace aU their fibres without maceration and preparation, which it is impracticable tor the student to undertake; he will be able to make out sufiicient, however, to assist materially in foUowmg the descnption.J The Perineeal Body of Savage (Fig. 109, 14), pecuUar to women, consists of an elastic ma?s of tissue placed between the oi-ifices of the vagina and rectum, and imiting aU the structures which meet in the central point of the pernia>um. Its use appears to be to allow of great stretching, without tearing, diuing parturition. Fig. 108.—The female perinssum (Savage and Hirschfeld). 1. Dorsal artery of clitoris. 8.

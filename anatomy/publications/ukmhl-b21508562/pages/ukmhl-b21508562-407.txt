351 THE GREAT SACRO-SCIATIC LIGAMENT. oblique sacro-i/iac iiganwiit (3) is merely a suijerficial portion of the posterior ligament, which reaches from the posterior superior spine of the iUiim to the thiitl lateral tubercle ou the sacrum. "When the ilium and sacrum are separated after the dissection of the other Hgameats of the pelvis, a distinct layer of cartilage will he found between the two bones, with occasionally an intervening space. The joint belongs to the " amphiarthroses," and is only susceptible of very slight motion except under cei'tain pathological conditions. Saero-sciatic Ligaments (Fig. 177).—These ligaments have been partially exposed in the dissection of the gluteal region. Fig. 176. ni.^ Grmtsucro-8ckdiclujament{z) is broad at its upper attach- ment to the posterior inferior sjiine of the ilium and to the sides of the sacrum and coccyx, and after narrowing con.siderably expands agam to become attached to the inner and back part of the tuberosity of the ischium. A portion of tliis ligament, by its alci orm prolongation to the ramus of the ischium, has been seen to piotect the pudic vessels and nerve : its ischial extremitv is contmuous with the tendons of the biceps and semi-tendinosus m.l IS occasionally separated from the tuberosity by a bursa.

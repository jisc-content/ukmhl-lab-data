THE SPINAL CORD. 615 of the spinal nerves, and clividiug each half of the cord into anterior, lateral and posterior columns. The last is fui'ther sub-divided, most distinctly in the cervical region, by a longitudinal fissure of small depth into a postero-lateral column, or Column of Burdach (Fig. 291, 17), and a postern-mesial column, or Column of Goll (Pig. 291, 18). The anterior roots of the nerves emerge at the antero-lateral line, marking off the anterior column fi'om the lateral colimin. At the bottom of the median fissures are the anterior and posterior commissures. The Spinal Nerves (Pig. 290) are thii-ty-one in niunber on each side .of the cord. Each nerve has been seen to arise by two roots, the posterior (except in the fii-st nerve) being larger than the anterior. The posterior roots have each a gang- lion, which is generally placed in the intervertebral foramen; and immediately beyond the ganglion, the anterior or motor and posterior or sensory roots unite to form a spinal nerve of mixed endowments. The first and second cervical, with the sacral and coccygeal neiwes, are exceptions to the general riUe as regards the position of the ganglia. The ganglia of the upper two cervical nerves lie upon the arches of the atlas and axis, at which point the roots of the nerves Fig. 293.

The Sensory Division (Fig. 224) breaks up, close to the base of the skull, into three branches, the Lingual Nerve the most anterior ; the Inferior Dental Nerve (which has some motor fibres) in the middle; and the Auricido-Temporal Nerve posteriorly. [The auriculo-temporal nerve is to be carefuUy dissected out from the tough fibrous tissue of the articulation, and traced through tHe parotid to the pinna and temple.] The Lingual or Gustatory Nerve* (Fig. 224, 16) lies at first between the two pterygoid muscles, and then passes forward be- tween the internal surface of the ramus of the jaw and the mternal pterygoid muscle; it will be afterwards traced to the side and tip of the tongue. Beneath the external pterygoid the nerve is 30ined at an acute angle by the smaU chorda tympani nerve (7), and is connected with the inferior dental nerve by a transverse branch. The chorda tympani is a branch of the facial nerve given oli in the temporal bone, and passes through the tympanum between the handle of the maUeus and the long process of the mens, to emerge through the canal of Huguier at the inner side of the Glaseiian fissure, to which it should now be traced. The Inferior Dental Nerve (Fig. 224, 18) has a branch of com- munication with the Ungual trunk, and then descends with ^e inferior dental artery (p. 452) between the ramus of the jaw and internal pterygoid muscle and the long internal lateraUigament, to reach the dental foramen. After entering the bone it supplies all the teeth of the lower jaw, partly by dii-ect filaments, partly by its incisor branch (22), and emerges at the mental foramen as the mental nerve (24), with its accompanying artery, supplymg sen.oiy fibres to the muscles, mucous membrane, ^i^^/'^t^g;}^^* "^J^ lower lip, and to the body of the lower jaw.

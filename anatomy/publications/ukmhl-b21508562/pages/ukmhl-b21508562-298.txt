254 CAVITY OF THE ABDOMEN. colon to the under surface of the diaphragm; it passes below the spleen and limits the movements of that organ. Ahove the colon the arrangement is complicated by the existence of the two sacs, the continuity of which may here be demonstrated (Fig. 127). Beginning at the median line of the abdominal wall, the peritoneum may be traced into the right hjqDochondrium and over the right kidney ; it then forms the posterior boundary of the foramen of Winslow, passes in front of the pancreas, and runs forward to the cardiac end of the stomach, forming the gastru-phrenic ligament. It then covers the posterior surface of the stomach, and returns to the foramen of Winslow as the posterior layer of the lesser omentum. Eeflected at this point upon itself, the membrane runs to the left as the anterior layer of the lesser omentum, and is continued over the front of the stomach; thence, formmg the anterior layer of the gastro-splenic omentum, it reaches the s]ileen and encloses it, then forms the posterior layer of the gastro-splemc omentum, passes from tlie spleen to the outer aspect of the left kidney, formingthelieno-renal fold, andsotothe left hypochondnum and roxmd the abdominal wall.

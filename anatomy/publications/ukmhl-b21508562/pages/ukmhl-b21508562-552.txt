486 THE PHARYNX. oesophagus. The fibrous aponeurosis is to be detached from the occipital bone on each side and held widely open with hooks, and the whole of the cotton-wool is to be removed from the mtenor ot the pharjnix.] The Mucous Surface or Interior of the Pharynx (Fig. 235) is in communication with the nose, ears, mouth, larynx, and oeso- phagus by the following seven openings named in order from above domiwards: (1 and 2) the two posterior nares [clioanw), separated by the vomer ; (3 and 4) the two Eustachian tubes; (5) the isthmm fancium or opening of the mouth, bounded above by the soft palate, 'below by the tongue, and at the sides by the anterior pillars of the fauces; (6) the superior aperture of the larynx, guarded by the epiglottis ; and (7) the commencement of the oesophagus. The character of the epithelium varies in different situations being squamous below the level of the palate, but columnar and ciHated above that point. Close to the base of the skull is a coUec- tion of follicular glands, extending across fi-om one Eustachian tube to the other, and forming the pharyngeal tomil of Kolhker. In the median line, beneath the basilar process of the occi- pital bone, may be seen a depression called the hirrsa j.harymjea which represents the remains of an opening which, in early foetal life, passes through the base of the cranium mto the pitiutary The opening of the Eustachian tube appears behind the lower part of the apertm-e of the posterior nares, about half an inch posterior to the hinder extremity of the inferior turbmate_ body, and the free extremity of the cartilage forms a distinct projection (tnhal eminence) behind the orifice. Behind the tubal eminence is a deep recess, the fossette of BosenmuUer,^ and below it may Ij seen the rounded ridge of the levator palati descendmg to the soft ^this^?-t?e'^best opportunity for studying the Process of Deglutition.

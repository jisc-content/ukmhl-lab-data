THE ophthalmk; artery. 391 nerve, and, running between the choroid and sclerotic with the long ciliary nerves, supijly the iris, the ciliary muscle, and the cornea. The Ophthalmic Artery (Fig. 192, 2) arises from the internal carotid close to the anterior clinoid process, and enters the orbit through the optic foramen with the optic nerve, beneath and some- what to its outer side. It gives off the following branches :— a. The Lachrijmal artertj (5) aiscompanies the lachi-ymal nerve along the external superior angle of the orbit to the lachrymal glaiKi which it supplies. It gives twigs to the conjunctiva and eydids, and other.s thro.igh small foramina to reach L t mporal fossa. It IS joined by a twig from the middle meningeal. J., ihe S,rpra-orlntal artery (11) ascends to join the fi-ontal nerve and afterwards accompanies the supra-orbital nerve through tl; supra-orbital notch to the forehead. tniougn tHe .

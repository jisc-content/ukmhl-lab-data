SINUSES OF THE DURA MATER. 367 meatus with the auditory vessels. The 9th nerve or glosao-pharyn- ijtal vuns with the 10th or iwjns, and the 11th or spinal accessory, to jjierce the diu'a mater at a point external to the jugular eminence of the occipital bone, and appear in the angle between the lateral and inferior petrosal sinuses, where these are about to pierce the jugular foramen before uniting to form the jugular vein. The 9th is the highest of the three, and has a separate dural aperture, while the 11th is joined by spinal filaments which pass upwards from the spmal canal. The three nerves disappear thi-oiigh the forwmcu lace- rum posterms or jugular foramen with the sinuses named. The 12th (hypoylossal) nerve consists of two bundles placed near the median Ime, which pierce the dura mater separately between the jugular eminence and foramen magnum and then pass together through the anterior condyloid foramen. At the point of junction between the falx cerebri and the tentorium will be found the atraiyht sinus, joining the lateral and superior longitudinal sinuses at the torcular Herophih: it receives anteriorly the inferior longitudinal sinus which runs m the free border of the faLx cerebri, and the veins of Cralen passmg from the velum interpositum; and in its com-se it is jomed by the superior cerebellar veins. The knife is now to be pushed through the foramen magnum so as to divide all the parts passing into the skull, viz., the spinal cord and Its membranes, the two vertebral arteries, the small spinal vessels, and the two spinal-accessory nerves; and it should be tv ?l T considerably lower than the point at which the vertebral arteries enter the spinal canal.

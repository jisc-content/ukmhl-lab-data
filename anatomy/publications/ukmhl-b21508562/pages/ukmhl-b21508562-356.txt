304 THE ABDOMINAL VISCERA. The Liver (Figs. 152, 153) when removed from the body loses to a very large extent the lorm which is impressed upon it by the contact of the abdominal walls and the neighbouring viscera. It presents upper and under surfaces, united by a thick posterior siu'face and a thin anterior margin. Its ordinary measairements are, twelve inches across, six from before backwards, and three inches in its greatest thickness; and its weight is from three to four pounds It is fixed to the diaphragm by peritoneal reflections, which are called respectively the superior or falciform, the posterior or coronary, and the right and left lateral ligaments, and by a fibrous cord resulting fi'om the obUteration of the umbilical vein of the fcetus, which runs to its lower surface and is known as the ' round Hgament.' The upper surface is cUvided into two unequal parts, ot Fig. 152. which the right is the larger, by the attachment of the/.W - ligament, the two layers of which will be pfstex^oriy, foi-ming the upper layer of the ^^^J^;!>T\^1^1 l■,av^en^s!

THE MESIAL SURFACE OF THE BRATN. 639 and (3) the cakarine; and hj means of these the convolutions may be divided into four gi-oups, (1) the gyrus fornicatus, (2) the marginal convolutions, (3) the quadi'ate lobule, and (4) the cuneate lobule. The CaUoso-marijinal fissure commences a Little below the rostrum of the corpus callosum, and ciirves forwards around the genu and backwards above the body, finally running upwards opposite the splenium to the margin of the longitudinal fissiu'e. V\s. 301. The CaJcarine fissure itms from near the lower part of the hinder extremity of the hemisphere forwards to a point a Httle below the splenuim of the corpus caUosum, dividing the posterior extremity of the uncinate gp-us into two parts. It con-esponds to a proiec- tion called the hippocampus minor in the posterior horn of "the lateral venti'icle. The Internal Parieto-occipital fissure is continuous above with the external parieto-occipital fissiu-e of the calvarial sui-face, and Fig. 301.-The inner and under siirfaGe of a cerebral hemisphere showing the convohitiona and Hulci (modified after Thane).

It is here that the artery can be effectu- ally compressed in cases of haemorrhage. The perinseal branches of the pudic artery and nerve leave the main trunks in the anterior part of the ischio-rectal fossa, but will be better seen afterwards. The Levator Ani Muscle {Fig. 99, i8) arises within the pelvis. It is attached to the back of the os pubis, about an inch below the Fig. 99. crest,^ to the mner sm^face of the spine of the ischium, and to the white Hne " of the pelvic fascia a fibrous baud, which is stretched between these bony points, and coincides with the sub-division of the pelvic fascia into its parietal portion (obturator fascia) and Pig. 99.—Superficial dissection of male perinreum (drawn by J.

462 THE SUBMAXILLARY REGION. upon tlie hyo-glossus, which separates it from the lingual artery, and after communicating with the lingual nei-ve, it ends in the genio-glossus muscle. It gives branches in this part of its course to the stylo-glossus, hyo-glossus, genio-glossus, and genio-hyoid muscles, and also to the Fig. 226. intrinsic muscles of the tongue itself. Its branches and communications are described on p. 423. The Hyo-Glossus (Fig. 226, 6) arises from the outer part of the body of the hyoid bone, from the upper margin of the whole length of its great cornu, and fi'om the lesser cornu. It runs up- wards and forwards, and is â– inserted into the side of the dorsum of the tongue, where its fibres blend with those of the stylo-glossus and lie out- side the inferior lingualis. It is sometimes described as consisting of three separate portions, corresponding to its three attachments to the hyoid bone-basio-glossus, kerato-glossus, and chondi-o-glossus. , On the Older side of the hyo-glossus are the mylo-hyoid, stylo- hyoid, digastricus, and stylo-glossus n.uscles, the ranme vem, the gustatory and hypoglossal nerves, the submaxiUaiT gangbon, the ^ubliugual and deep portion of the submax^ary glands, and Fig. 226.-Styloid muscles and muBcles of the tongue (from Wilson) 1.

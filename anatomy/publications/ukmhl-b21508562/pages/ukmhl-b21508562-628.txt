THE THORAX. 502 pulmonary would occupy the highest and most anterior position of the four orifices, well on the left of the middle line of the body; the aortic orifice is a little below it, nearer to, and sometimes touching, the mesial plane; the mitral orifice lies at a still lower level and on the left; and Fig. 268. the tricuspid orifice, slightly lower than the last, is the only one on the right of the mid-line. The Foetal Circula- tion (Fig. 26S).-This wiU be the best oppor- tunity for contrasting the adult circulation with that of the fcetus. In the foetus the blood is brought fi'om the placenta by the innhi- h'cal vein, which, en- tering the body at the lunbilicus, passes up- wards to the longitu- dinal fissure of the Hver, and at the ti-ans- verse fissui'e divides into thi-ee branches, two jouiing the poi-tal vein, the other, called the diicfus i-e>wsiis, joining the inferior vena cava. The pla- cental blood hence enters the inferior vena cava in two streams; the larger through the hepatic veins after having cii-culated thi-ough the liver, where it undergoes partial depuration by the exci-etion of a. Umbilical vein. b. Ductus venosuB. c. Ductus arteriosus. d. Hypogastric arteries Fig. 268.â€”Fcetal circulation (from Wilson). e.

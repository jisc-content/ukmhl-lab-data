THE INTERNAL JUGULAR VEIN. 477 filaments to the vertebfcal artery, branches to the subclavian artery, and the inferior cardiac nerve to the deep cardiac plexus. The Twelfth or Hypoglossal Nerve (Fig. 231, lo) is necessarily cut off at the anterior condyloid foramen in making the dissection, and should therefore be traced from below, where it will be found m relation with the occipital arteiy. The nerve has been described on jjp. 423 and 461. The Internal Jugular Vein (Pig. 231, 8) is exposed at its oiigm. Its coui-se in the neck has been abeady seen (p. 470), and 231â€”Dissection of the pharynx with the carotid vessels and the ninth tentn, eleventh, twelfth, and sympathetic nerves (drawn by J. T.

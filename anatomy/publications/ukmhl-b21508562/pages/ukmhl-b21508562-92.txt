Its tendon is covered by those of the common extensor, and running through the fourth division of the annular ligament with them, joins the ulnar side ot the tendon to the fore-finger. Actions.—The extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis is not only an extensor and abductor of the metacarpal bone ot the thumb, but is also an extensor and abductor of the wi'ist, and by means of its ulnar fibres a shght supinator of the fore-ann. The eTiensor prrm,. internodv has similar actions upon the wi-ist, and extends the thumb at the carpo-metacarpal and metacarpo-phalangeal jomts. iHe extensor secundi internodfi acts upon the carpo-metacariial, meta- carpo-phalangeal and inter-phalangeal joints (m the latter case being reinforced by the conti-action of the two thenar muscles which send slips to its tendon), and aids also in supination of the The extensor indicis and extensor minimi digiti are accessory to the corresponding tendons of the extensor communis, and serve to give ii^ependent 'action to the two digits. All the short extensors are sminlii'd by the posterior interosseous nerve. The Posterior Interosseous Artery (Fig. 27, 8) ansmg from the interosseous, a branch of the ulnar artery, reaches the back «f the fore-arm by passing between the radius and /^^ov^ the interosseous membrane, but below the oblique hgament (p. o4).

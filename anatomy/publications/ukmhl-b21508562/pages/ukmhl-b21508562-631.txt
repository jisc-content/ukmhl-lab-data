565 THE PULMONARY ARTERY. long-; it has already been seen to arise from the right ventricle and there to Ue in front, and a little to the left, of the aorta, having in contact with it the two coronary arteries and the auricular appen- dages. It passes backwards and upwards to the left side of the aorta, l3"iug in front of the left aiuicle, and, after reaching the hollow of the aortic arch, it bifurcates opposite the oth or 6th thoracic vertebra into the right and left pulmonary arteries. These go to their respective lungs; the right being the longer of the two Fig 270. Fig. 270.—Median sagittal s 1. Body of 3rd thoracic vertebra. 2. QSsophagus. 3. Descending aorta. 4.

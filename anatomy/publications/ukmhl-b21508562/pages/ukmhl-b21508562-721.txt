INFERIOK SURFACE OF THE CEREBELLUM. 655 Eacli hemispliere is subdivided into five lobes. Bebind is tbe Posterior Lobe (ii); next tbe Slender Lobe (lo); and in front of tbat the Biventral or Digastric Lobe (5); tbe AmygiMa or Tonsil (Fig. 298, 29) is a prominent lobe close to tbe vallecula, wbicb it partially conceals; and tbe Flocculus (Fig. 309, 4) is a small lobe immedi- ately in front of tbe biventral lobe and beneatb tbe crus cerebeUi, wbence it is sometimes called tbe subpeduncular lobe. It is closely Fig. 309. related to tbe roots of tbe seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth, and eleventh nerves. Tbe Inferior Verniiforni Process (Fig. 309) is divided into four portions. Mostly anteriorly is tbe NoduJe (6) which projects into the fourth ventricle; next is a narrow ridge called the Uvula (7), so called from its position between tbe two tonsils; this is succeeded by tbe Pyramid (9), and most posteriorly are a few ti'ansverse laminse, constituting tbe tuber valvulte. By turning aside or cutting away tbe amygdala, a layer of white matter will be brought into view extending from the flocculus on each side to the top of the nodule. This is tbe Velum medullare inferius (8). Fig. 309.â€”Under surface of cerebellum, the amygdalte having been removed (from Hirschfeld and Leveille). 1. Medulla oblongata. 2. Pons Varolii. 3.

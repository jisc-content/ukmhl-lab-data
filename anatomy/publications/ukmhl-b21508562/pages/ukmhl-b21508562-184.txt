THE BACK OF THK LEG. 150 Fig. 68. annular ligaments, are to be preserved. The muscles of the calf are then to be dissected, after being put on the stretch by supporting the knee and drawing the toes towards the front of the leg.] The Gastrocnemius (Eig. 69, 4), the superficial muscle of the calf, has a double-headed oriijln from the back of the femur immediately above the condjdes, the origin of the outer head extending into a little depression above the back of the pop- liteal groove ^ipon the external suiiace of the outer tuberosity, while that of the inner head runs upwards for about an inch along the internal supra- condyloid ridge. A. bursa, sometimes commmiicatiug with the knee-joint, lies upon the back of the capsule beneath the inner head and the tendon of the semi-membranosus. The two heads (with the plantaris on the outer side), are the lower boujidaries of the popliteal space, and unite to form one large muscle, the fibres of which end about the middle of the leg in a broad thin tendon that is joined anteriorly | and laterally by the soleus. The con- joined tendon contracts near the heel into the thick rounded teiah Achillis (6), which expands again slightly, to be inserted into the middle part of the posterior surface of the calcanemn, a hiirsa intervening between it and the upper part of this surface of the bone.

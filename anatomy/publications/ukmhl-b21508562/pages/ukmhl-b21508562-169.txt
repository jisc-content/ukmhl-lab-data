135 THE SMALL SCIATIC NERVE. between the gluteus medius and minimus and supply these muscles, the lower one going forward to the tensor fasciae femoris. The Small Sciatic Nerve (Fig. 62, 8) is one of the main branches of the sacral plexus, arising from the second and third sacral nerves, and appears at the lower border of the pyi-iformis to become the cutaneous nerve at the back of the thigh. As soon as it emerges from the pelvis it gives recuiTent cutaneous branches to the skin over the lower part of the gluteus maxi- mus, and sometimes an //;fm-ior (jluteul branch to the under surface of the muscle itself. It then gives off the inferior puden- dal nerve which winds below the Fig. 62.â€”Nerves of the buttock and back of the tlaigh (from Hirschfeld and Leveille). 1. Gluteus maximus. 2. Gluteus medius. 3.

THE CEREBELLUM. (Fig. 311) are found in or near the floor of tlie fourth ventricle. The nuclei for the third and fourth nerves lie in the anterior wall of the Aqiieduct of Sylvius. The motor and sensoiy roots of the 5th arise each by two groups of cells, which extend the whole length of the medulla'and by the side of the Sylvian aqueduct. The sixth arises from the upper part of the wall close to the middle line, the seventh external and a little inferior to the 6th, the eighth by two nuclei, one beneath the acoustic sti-iee, the other altogether outside Fig. 314.—Section of medulla about the middle of olivary body (Scliwalbe). f.l.a.

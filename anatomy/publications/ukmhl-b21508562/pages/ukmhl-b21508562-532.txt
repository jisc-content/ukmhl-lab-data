4(58 BEEP DISSECTION OF THE NECK. The Ascending Pharyngeal Artery (Fig. 231, 9) can now be traced from the external carotid artery ^ear its origin, along its coxu-se between the internal carotid and the pharynx. It gives branches to the prevertebral muscles, anastomosing with the ascending cei-vical artery, and near the base of the sknU divides into palato-pharyngeal and meningeal branches Themennujeal branches are very small, and enter the skull by the foramen lacerum medium and the foramen jngulare, to supply the ^ThTtaMo-pharyngeal hranches supply the pharj^ix and tnni over the uppei' border of the superior constrictor to enter the soft palate, one accompanying the tendon of the tensor palati muscle.

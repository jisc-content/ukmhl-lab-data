THE SUBMAXII,LARY REGION. 458 and temporal branches to tlie greater part of the temporal regioii. It communicates witli the temporo-facial portion of the facial nerve and with the vti.c ijanglion. The Submaxillahy Eegion. The Suhmaxillary region has been partially dissected with the anterior triangle of the neck. It is triangular in shape, and is bounded by the lower border of the lower jaw above, the mid-line from symphysis to hyoid bone in front, and the body of the hyoid body with the stylo-hyoid and posterior belly of the digastric below. Its floor is formed by the anterior belly of the digastric, the mylo-hyoid, the hyo-glossus, and the middle constrictor. It contains the superficial portion of the submaxillary saUvary gland with its capsule; the submaxillary lymphatic glands; the facial artery, giving ofE its submaxillary, submental, ascending palatme, and tonsillar branches ; the facial vein; the hypoglossal nerve; aud the mylo-hyoid nerve and vessels. It is covered in by the super- ficial and deep fascite, the platysma, infra-maxillaiy branches of the facial nerve, and branches of the superficial cervical nerve. Under cover of the jaw may also be seen in this dissection the stylo-glossus, the stylo-pharyngeus, the superior constrictor, the glosso-pharyngeal and lingual (gustatory) nerves, Wharton's duct, and the ranine vein ; but these do not belong to the triangle. TThe facial artery is to be divided at the jaw, a.nd together with the submaxillary gland turned back, without d/^placmg a deep portion of the gland which lies beneath the posterior pait ot the fnT-hyoidmufcle ; the latter, formingthefloor o the ^ub^xd^^^^^^^ trianale will be exposed, and on its surface will be seen the mylo- hyo^'branch of arLy and nerve derived fâ„¢-^J^" ^J^^ trunks, the artery anastomosing with the ^^^^-^^f f, ^t^"teriion facial By cutting thi-ough the digastric muscle at its inseition.

44 the; front of the fore-arm. The Superior Profunda branch of the brachial ai-tery acccom- panies the musculo-spu-al nerve aroimd the bone, and supplies the triceps in its coui-se. Beneath the muscle a branch ascends to anastomose with the posterior circumflex artery. At the umer edge of the triceps it gives off a rather large branch, the descendiiijj articular, which runs down to the back of the elbow beneath the triceps close to the external intermuscular septum, to anas- tomose with the posterior inter- osseous reciu-rent and with the anastomotic and inferior pro- funda arteries. The terminal branch, usually of small .size, rims with the nerve between the supinator longus and brachialis anticiis to anastomose with the radial recuiTcnt artery. The Front of the Foke-akji.

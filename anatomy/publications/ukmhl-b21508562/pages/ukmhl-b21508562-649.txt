The thoracic ganglia are generally said to correspond to the ribs in number, but the first ganglion often blends with the inferior cervical ganglion; and occasionally two of the lower gan- glia are united. Each gangKon Fig. 276. CARDIAC artel [ AORTIC PULMONARY OESOPHAGEAL gives off uscendiiKj and descending branches of communication with the ganglia above and below, ex- ternal branches (usually two) to the thoracic spinal nerves, and interimJ branches of distribution (Kg. 276). The internal branches from the five or six upper ganglia are given to the vertebras and their Ligaments, the oesophagus, and the j)osterior pulmonary and aortic plexuses. From the internal branches of the six or seven lower ganglia arise the sj^lanchnic nerves and branches to the aortic i:)lexus. Splanchnic Nerves (Pig. 271,43). The fjrrat splanchnic nerve is derived from five ganglia (6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th) by separate fibres. It runs inwards in the posterior media- stiiumi and, after piercing the crus of the diaphragm, joins the semi- hmar gangHon and the renal and suprarenal plexuses in the ab- domen. The lesser sp/anchnic ■ nerre is derived from the 10th and 11th ganglia, and also pierces the crus of the diaphragm to join the solar, renal, and suprai'enal plexuses. The least splanchnic nerve is derived from the 12th ganglion, and goes to the renal plexus. The Internal Intercostal Muscles (Fig. 274) can be seou beneath the plomfe without any further dissectitm. Beginning at the sternum the muscles reach as far as the angles of the Hbs, ,„7 tEJSER ^ Z^., SPLANCHNIC I Fig. 276.—The sympathetic chiiin in the thorax (from Wilson).

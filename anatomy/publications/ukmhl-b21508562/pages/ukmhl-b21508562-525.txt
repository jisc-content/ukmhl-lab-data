461 THE HYPOGLOSSAL NEHVF:. nerve to the ganglion ; and a sympathetic root from the plexus on the facial artery (superior cervical ganglion). The branches of dis- tribution are given to the submaxillary gland, Wharton's duct, and the mucous membrane of the mouth. The chorda ti/mpani is after- wards prolonged to the tongue, conveying the lingual gustatory filaments fi-om the glosso-pharjnigeal nerve, but its distribution there is imcertain. Probably, however, it supplies the fungiform Fig. 225. and filiform papiUfe, and gives a branch to the inferior lingualis muscle. The Hypoglossal Nerve (Fig. 225, 15) (12th) has been seen crossmg the upper part of the anterior triangle, after hooking round the sterno-mastoid artery, to disappear beneath the submaxillary gland and posterior border of the mylo-hyoid. It is now seen to lie Fig. 225.â€”Nerves of the tongue (from Hirschfelrl and Leveill6). 1. Lingual nerve (5th' 2. Submaxilhiry ganghon. 3. Chorda tympani nerve. 4.

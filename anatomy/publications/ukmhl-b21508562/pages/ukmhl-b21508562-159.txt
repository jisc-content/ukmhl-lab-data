a round tendon, which is inserted THE ADDUCTOR MAGNUS. 125 anterior fibres pass oiitwards, with different degrees of obliqiiity, to be inserted into the back of the feiuiu' immediately below the quadratus femoris down to the linea aspera, and may be separated from the rest to form an "adductor minimus" ; the middle fibres pass into the whole length of the linea aspera, and a small portion of the line leading from it to the internal condyle ; while the jiosterior ischial fibres (24) run verticallj' downwards to end in into the tubercle above the inner condyle of the femur, and, by means of an expansion, into the lower jjart of the hne leading to it. This tendon forms the arch for the jjassage of the femoral vessels into the poijliteal space, and gives origin to the lower fibres of the vastus intemus. The muscle is siipplied by the Fig. 57.â€”Nerves of the tliigli (from Hirsclifeld and Leveille). 1. Gangliated cord of sympathetic. 2. Third lumbar nerve. 3. Branches to the iliacus iuternus. 4.

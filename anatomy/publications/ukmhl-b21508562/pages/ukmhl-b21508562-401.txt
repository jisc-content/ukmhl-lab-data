345 THE UTKRUS. backwards in a slightly curved course which differs according to the degree of distension of the rectum. The lower end of the uterus will be felt projecting into its cavity, but the point of reflection of the mucous membrane on to the os uteri {funux), is much higher behind than in fi-ont, and hence the greater length of the posterior wall, which lies in contact with both lips of the os. At its lower end are the remains of the htjmen (carimcuJa myrfiformes), and below these may be seen the orifices of the two smaU <j/ands of Barthohi,, above two folds of vvilvar mucous membrane called the m/mp/ut. The Uterus (Fig. 175, i) is more or less pyriform in shape, the upper part or body being broad and somewhat flattened from before backwards, and larger above than below; the lower part or cervix beuig cylindrical. It opens below into the vagina. [The anterior wall is to be divided verticaUy with scissors, and tJie cut prolonged on each side towards the Fallopian tube.] The direction of the long axis of the uterus is doubtful, but in all probability it varies considerably with the changing conditions ot the bladder and intestines. Under orcHnary cii-cumstances its summit never rises above the plane of the pelvic inlet. It IS about three inches long, and its maximum transverse and antero-posterior diameters are two inches and one inch respectively. Its antenor surface is flattened, and is covered with peritoneum as far as the junction of body and cervix; its posterior surface is •convex^ju^^ by peritoneum over its whole length as far Fig. 173.-Side view of the female pelvis (from Savage^^EWl^vic Oi-crans) R ^'""'''^ '^-^^ II"^" ^^-tenes.

177 THE PERONEUS LONGUS. lying behind that of the peroneus brevis and overlapping it; from the intermuscular septum on each side; and from the fascia cover- ing it. It ends in a strong tendon, which lies superficial to that of the peroneus brevis and runs behind the external malleolus and under the external annular ligament; it then passes in a separate sheath of fascia along the outer side of the OS calcis behind the peroneal tubercle to reach the cuboid bone, around which it turns to the sole of the foot. In the sole the tendon runs at first over a facet beneath the outer border of the ridge of the cuboid, then lies in the groove of the cuboid bone and in an osseo-fibrous sheath; it is inserted into the lower part of the outer side of the base of the first metatarsal bone, and into the adjacent part of the internal cuneiform. The sheath of the tendon is fonned superficially by fibres of the long plantar ligament, and is Kned with a bursal membrane. The tendon has a sesamoid cartilage or bone developed in its fibres where it turns round the border of the cuboid bone.

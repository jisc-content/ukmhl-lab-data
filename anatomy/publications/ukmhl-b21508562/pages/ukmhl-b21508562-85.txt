Au incision is also to be made along the thumb and each of the fingers, and the skm reflected, and then the cutaneous nerves and vessels, but especially the veins, are to be dissected out of the superficial fascia.] Cutaneous Nerves (Fig. 23).—The back of the fore-arm is supplied in the middle by the branches of the mmcido-spiral nerve (2), which was seen above the condyles of the humerus in the dissection of the back of the arm (p. 41), and on the outer side of the limb by branches from the miiscido- cutuueous nerve (4), and on the inner side by branches of the in- ternal cutaneous nerve (3). At the wiist, on the outer side, the large radial nerve (6) pierces the deep fascia in the lower thu'd of the fore- arm, and, after communicating with the musculo-cutaneous nerve, distributes digital branches to both sides of the thiunb, fore-finger, and middle finger, and to the radial side of the ring finger ; it forms in addi- tion a loop across the back of the hand with the dorsal hranch of the ulnar ne.rce (7), which ajjpears on the inner side of the wrist, at a point coiTesponding to the lower end of the ulna, and gives digital branches to both sides of the little finger and the ulnar side of the ring finger, joining the radial nerve across the back of the hand.

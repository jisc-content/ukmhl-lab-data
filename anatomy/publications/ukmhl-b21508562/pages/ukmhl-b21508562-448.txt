THE ORBIT. 390 lateral uasal cartilage. It gives olf, 1, the Ivuij rout to the lenticular ganglion, on the outer side of the optic nerve ; 2, two hm<j ciliary werces, which run with the short ciliary branches and perforate the sclerotic near the entrance of the optic nerve ; 3, the infru-trochhur nerve, which, arising just before the nerve enters the ethmoidal foramen, passes forwards to escape from the orbit beneath the pulley of the superior oblique. It communicates with the supra- trochlear nerve, and is distributed to the integument of the eyelids and side of the nose, the lachrymal sac, the conjunctiva, and the caruncula lachrjnnalis. The Lenticular Ganglion {ciliary or ophthalmic) (Pig. 191) is a minute pink body placed between the optic nerve and external rectus near the back of the orbit. It should be exposed, as akeady Fig. 191. mentioned, by division of the external rectus after the removal of the outer wall of the orbit. It has. like all the cranial gangha sensory, motor, and sympathetic roots. The sensory or long root (2) is derived from the nasal branch of the 5th, and enters the pos- terior superior angle of the ganglion. The motor ov short i-oot 4 is derived from the branch of the 3rd "<^^ve suppljang the ii^e^^^^^^^ oblique, which can be seen passing along the bottom of the oibit this root enters the ganglion at its posterior inferior angle ihe sympathetic root (6) comes from the cavernous P/^^^^ internal carotid artery, and enters the orbit through fPl--'^- fissure ; it joins the ganglion between the other two root., but can rarely be seen in an ordinary dissection. The.;.or^ miliary hranches of the ganglion arise from its and lower angles in front, and are eight or pierce the back of the sclerotic coat of the eyeball around the optic Fig I91.-Diagram of the lenticular ganglion (from Hirschfeld and Leveill^). 1.

558 THE THORAX. [The left auricle is to be opened by one vertical incision on its posteiior aspect, midway between the pulmonaiy veins, and another into the auricular appendage. The heart must be drawn well upwards and to the right side to expose the cavity properly.] The Left Auricle (Fig. 265, i) resembles the right auiicle, but the sinus venosus is free fi'om musculi pectinati, and the auiicular appendix is longer and thinner and more " crenate." The openings into it are those of the pulmonary veins, two on each side, and the left auiiculo-ventricular orifice, which is smaUer than that on the right side. The musvuh- pecUndti of the auricular appendix are like those ot the right side but smaUer. On the septiun of the auncle may be indistinctly visible the annulus ovalis and fossa ovalis, and the free edge of the valve of the foramen ovale may be seen as a Uttle semilunar fiu-row outside the upper and anterior portion of the annulus. It is here that a persistent communication may sometunes be found between the two amides. [To open the left venti-icle, the left forefinger should be intro- duced thi-ough the auriculo-ventiicular opemng, and the knile thi-ust thi-ou|h the waU of the ventricle near the apex to meet it The knife is then guided upwards between the flaps of the mitral valve, and an incision made thi-ough the fi-ont of tbe ventacle mto the am-iculo-ventricilar opening. The finger ^« ^^^J^to be pas.ed from below into the aorta, followed by the knife, carried through the front wall of the yentric e ^o the septom^ thus isolatin<?the right flap of the mitral valve. The incision is to bf mXS into the aorta between two of the semilunar valves, and^rSbe foimd to be necessary to divide tl^^ l^^^monar^^^^^^^^^ which lies in front of the aorta, but care should be taken to do so above the pulmonary semilunar valves.] The Left Ventricle (Eig. 265, 8) resembles the right, but its wall is at least three times as tHck, and its cavity reaches to the apex of the heart. The coluvimv carneoi and chorda: tmdiuav bear a resemblance to those of the right side. . The endocardium of the left cavities of the heart is thicker and more opaque than that of the right cavities. • • •, ^ The left aui-iculo-ventricular, mitral, or &ic»si>»rf valve, is similar in construction and connections to that of the right side, but pre- sents only two principal cusps with two small mtoi-mediatc cusp.. The larger cusp is in front and to the right of it. foUow, and is peculiai in forming a part of the conus arteriosus. It «^^««th on both surfaces, and is separated from the aortic valves by a small space with aponeurotic walls-thc intervalvidar space of Sibson-

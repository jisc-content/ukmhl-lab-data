270 INTERNAL STRUCTURE of the HEMISPHERES. PARTS SEEN BEFORE OPENING THE VENTRICLES : ( Centrum Ovale Minus - With the puncta vasculosa & the convoluted margin of the divided grey matter. Ventricle of tlie Corpus CalloSUm - Comprised between the corpus call ssum &' the gyrus fori licatus. Centrum Ovale MajuS - into which the fibres of the corpus callosum are continued on eith jr side. Corpus Callosum - Thick stratum of transverse & radiating white fibres which con. nect the two hemispheres j arched from before backwards, thickest & broadest behind, thinnest towards centre. It presents: Upper Sueface - Convex from before backwards, striated transversely, marked by a median depressed raphe which is bounded by two slightly elevated bands termed the nerves of Lancisi. More externally, beneath the gyrus fornicatus, are other similar bands, the strice longitudinales laterales. Under Surface - Blended behind with the fornix. In front, where it forms the roof of the lateral ventricles, it ia connected with the fornix by the septum Anterior Extremity or Genu - Curves downwards & backwards, presenting a narrowing reflected portion, the beak or rostrum. This latter is connected ! with the lamina cinerea, and gives off two small white bauds or peduncles, which cross the anterior perforated space to the entrance of the fissure of Sylvius. Posterior Extremity or Splenium - Thick & rounded. Forms upper boundary ,. ; , of middle portion of transverse fissare, and is joined in front,with the fornix.

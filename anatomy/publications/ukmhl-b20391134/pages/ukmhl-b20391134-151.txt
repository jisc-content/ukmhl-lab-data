141 THE TESTICLE & EPIDIDYMIS. THE TESTICLE is oval & compressed laterally, and so suspended by the spermatic cord as to present ? Upper Extremity - The largest, directed forwards & outwards. Presents a small pedun- culated body, the hydatid of Morgagni, probably a remnant of Muller's duct. Lower Extremity - The smaller, directed backwards & inwards. Lateral Surfaces - Looking respectively forwards & inwards, and backwards & outwards. Anterior Border - Convex, directed forwards, downwards & outwards. - All these parts are free, smooth, and entirely invested by the tunica vaginalis propria. Posterior Border - straight & flattened, directed backwards, upwards & inwards, covered by the epididymis & vas deferens, and only partly invested by the tunica vaginalis. The left testicle lies a little lower than the right one, and is frequently a littla largeRi THE EPIDIDYMIS Lies on the posterior border and back part of the outer surface of the testicle, and has the vas deferens on its inner side. It presents : Globus Major or Head - its upper enlarged extremity, connected to the testicle by the efferent ducts of the latter. Body â– - Free, surrounded by the tunica vaginalis, which dips in between it & the testicle along its outer border, and connects its inner or posterior border to the posterior border of the testicle. Globus Minor or Tail - Its lower pointed extremity, attached to the testicle by dense fibrous tissue. ^he tunica vaginalis covers the whole of the upper or outer surface of the epididymis, as Well as the under surface of its body. - The vas aber- rans of Haller communicates with the canal of the epididymis or with the oommenpement of the vas deferens

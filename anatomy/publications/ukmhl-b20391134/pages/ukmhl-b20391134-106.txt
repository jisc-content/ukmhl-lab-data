FASCIiE & SYNOVIAL MEMBBANES of the TARSUS. FASCIiE — Are rather ligaments than fasciss proper, and are therefore described here. Anterior? Annular Ligament - Consists of two portions connected by a thin inter- vening layer oi lascia. Superior or Vertical Portion - Of considerable breadth & continuous super- iorly with deep fascia of leg. It extends from lower part of anterior border of tibia to lower part of anterior border of fibula. Inferior or Horizontal Portion. - Narrower and continuous anteriorly with deep fascia over dorsum of foot. It extends from upper surface of os calcis, in front of groove for interosseous calcanecastragaloid ligament, to internal malleolus & inner border of plantar fascia. Beneath anterior annular ligament pass from within outwards: - . , , ,, 1. - Tendon of tibialis anticus contained throughout in a synovial sheath. 2. - Tendon of extensor proprius pollicis contained in a synovial sheath beneath the inferior or horizontal portion of the ligament only. 3. - Anterior tibial vessels 6^ nerve. , 4. - Tendons of extensor longus digitorum 6^ peroneus tertius enclosea throughout in one synovial sheath. 'fT^tPVYial AYiTinlar Ligament - Strong fibrous band continuous superiorly with internal Annular ^^IgamenL^.^^ ^^.^^^ inferiorly to innermost fibres of abductor pollicis. It extends obliquely from internal malleolus to inner surface ot os calcis. Beneath it pass from before backwards & outwards: - z. - Tendon of the tibialis posticus contained in a synovial sheath. 2. - Tendon of the flexor longus digitorum contained in another synovial sheath. - Posterior tibial vessels nerve. . , . • 1 t. xi. 5. - Tendon of the flexor longus pollicis also contained in a synovial sheath, and situated at a considerable depth in a groove on posterior surface of astragalus. External Annular Ligament-Narrower & thinner band extending from exter- nal malleolus to outer surface of os calcis, and beneath which pass Tendons ofperonei both enclosed in one synovial sheath. SYNOVIAL MEMBRANES — Are articular «& tendinous. Articular-Six:- /. - Synovial membrane of posterior calcaneo-astragaloid articulation. 2.-Synovial mejnbrane comtnon to the anterior calcaneo-astragaloid &* astragalo-scaphoid articulations. J. - Synovial membrane of calcaneo-culoid articulation. 4.-General synovial membrane of the tarsus comprised between the scaphoid & the three cuneiform bones, between the three cunei- form bones, between the external cuneiform bone & the cuboid, between the middle & external cuneiform bones on the one hand and the bases of the 2nd & 3rd metatarsal bones on the other, between the bases of the 2nd & 3rd metatarsal bones. - Sometimes there is a separate synovial membrane between the scaphoid & the cuboid, < - Svnovial membrane of the articulation between the cuboid and the 4th &* *^ jth metatarsal bones. 6 - Svnavial membrane of the articulation between the first cuneiform bone 6r» ^ , the first fnetatarsal. Tendinous - Vide Annular Ligaments.

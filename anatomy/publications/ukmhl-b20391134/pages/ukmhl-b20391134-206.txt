196 GLOSSO-PHABYNGEAL NERVE. The smallest of the three divisions of the 8th pair. Arises from tateraC tract of medulla oblongata abovepnetwtogastric. — Its deep origin is from a grey nucleus on floor of 4th ventricle, Through anterior & inner part of jugular foramen in front of pneumogastric & spinal accessory and in a separate sheath, grooving lower border of petrous portion of temporal bone and presenting two ganglia: Sup. or Jugular G. or G. of the Eoot — Small, and involves only the outer fibies; Inf. of Petrous G. or G. of Andersch — Larger, and involves whole of fibres. Gives off from petrous ganglion: Tympanic branch or jfacobson's nerve^ described below ; Anastomotic br. io ganglion of the root dr» to auricular br. of the pneumogastric ; and from a little below the ganglion: Anastomotic br. to facial nerve. This branch pierces post, belly of digastric. Downwards & forwards in front of pneumogastric & between int. carotid & int. jugular vein. Beneath styloid process & muscles connected with it to lower border of stylo-pharyngeus. Curves inwards upon stylo-pharyngeus & middle constrictor. Beneath hyo-glossus to mucous membrane of fauces & base of tonguo. BRANCHES: | Tympanic Br. or JaCObson's N. Arises from petrous ganglion. Ascends through small canal in petrous bone to tympanum, where divides into ; Bes. op Communication — To carotid plexus and great &=> small petrosal branches of facial. Brs. op Distribution — To fenestra rotunda, fenestra oralis ^ mucous mem- brane of Eustachian tube. Carotid Brs. —■ Descend on internal carotid artery, and join pharyngeal brs. of pneumogastric, sup. laryngeal & sympathetic. Pliaryngeal Brs. —Three or fouri form pharyngeal plexus by joining opposite middle constrictor with pharyngeal brs. of pneumogastric, sup. laryngeal & sympathetic. Muscular Brs. — To stylo=pharyngeus & constrictors of pharynx. Tonsillar Brs. "-=• To tonsil, forming tonsillar plezus, branches of which are distri. buted to soft palate & fauces, i Lingual Brs» To mucous membrane of base & side of tonerue.

125 ASCENDING VENOUS TRUNKS. COMMON ILIAC VEINS — Formed by junction of external & internal iliacs oppo- site sacro-vertebral articulation (some authors say opposite sacro-iliac synchondr- osis). Obliquely upwards, the left one more obliquely than the rif^ht, to a little to the right side of intervertebral disc between 4ith & 5fch lumbar vertebrae, where they unite to form the inferior cava. RIGHT COMMON ILIAC — Shorter & less oblique than the left one j lies at first behind & then on outer side of its artery. Receives Tributary Branclies: - I/W'Zum^ar, & sometimes Lateral Sacral. LEFT COMMON ILIAC — Longer & nvore oblique than the right one; lies at first on inner side of its artery, and then passes behind artery of right side. Receives Tributary Brandies: - IHo-Lumbart & sometimes the Lateral 6^ Middle Sacral. - The common iliao veins have no valves. INFERIOR VENA CAVA — Formed by junction of the two common iliacs a lui;le to the right side of intervertebral disc between 4th & 5th lumbar vertebrae. Along right side of aorta in front of right lumbar & renal arteries & right crus of dia- phragm, passing in succession behind attached border of mesentery, transverse por- tion of duodenum, pancreas, & portal trunk. Through groove or canal in posterior border of liver, where the hepatic veins open into it. Perforates central or cordiform tendon of diaphragm between its middle & right leaflets. inters fibrous bag of pericardium, becomes invested anteriorly by serous layer of same sac, and opens into lower & back part of right auricle near Interauricular septum, its opening being guarded by the Eustachian valve. Receives Tributary Branclies: - Middle Sacral, Ltcmbar, Renal, Hepatic, Right Sper- matiCi Suprarenal, dr* Inferior Phrenic, the middle sacral sometimea opening into the left common iliaa. 37

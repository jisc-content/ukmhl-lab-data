265 COVERINGS of the BRAIN & CORD-2nd Tablet. THE ARACHNOID Surrounds the brain & cord, from wliioh it is separated by the sub-arachnoidean space. Arachnoid of the Brain — On the upper surface of the hemispheres it is thin & transparent, and passes over the convolutions without dipping into the sulci. - At the base of the brain it is thicker and slightly opaque. Crossing from side to side between the two temporo-sphenoidal lobes and between tlio two hemispheres of the cerebellum & the medulla oblongata, it bounds inferiorly the anterior posterior subarachnoidean spaces. It is reflected round the cranial nerves in the shape of loose sheaths as far as their point of exit from the skull, where it becomes continuous with the parietal layer. Arachnoid of the Cord — Forms, especially in the lower part^ but a loose sheath round the cord & the roots of the nerves. This sheath is single round the two roots of each spinal nerve, and is continued as far as their exit from the dura mater; the arachnoid is also reflected over the processes of the ligamentiim denticulatum. THE SUBARACHNOIDEAN SPACE Is comprised between tlie pia mater & the visceral layer of the arachnoid, and contains the cerebro-spinal fluid. It usually communicates with the general ventricular cavity of the brain by an opening in the layer of pia mater which bounds the fourth ventriclo inferiorly. It is narrow on the surface of the hemispheres, but is greatly expanded both at the base of the brain in the situation of the anterior & posterior subarachnoidean spaces, and also round the spinal cord. It is crossed by numerous fibrous bands in the situation of the ba e of the brain and at the upper part of the back of the cord, and is partly subdivided by an incomplete membranous septum which connects the arachnoid with the pia mater opposite th© posterior median fissure. 32

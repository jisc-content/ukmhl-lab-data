29 MIDDLE FOSSA of BASE of SKULL. Is narrow in median line & expanded laterally. Is formed by body & greater wings of sphenoid, squamous portion and anterior Burface of petrous portion of temporal and anterior inferior angle of parietal, and is bounded by lesser wings of sphenoid & anterior margin of optic groove, in front, and by superior border of petrous bones behind. Presents the sutures between foregoing bones and In Median Line from before backwards: optic groove leading on either side to Optic foramen for optic nerve & ophthalmic artery, Olivary process^ Sella turcica on each side of which is the Cavernous groove^ Dorsum sellce presenting at its upper angles the Posterior clinoidprocesses. Laterally: Cerebral eminences & depressions, and grooves for middle meningeal artery; and more internally, and from before backwards: Sphenoidal fissure or foramen lacerum anterius for 3rd, 4th & 6th nerves, and ophthalmic nerve & vein. Foramen rotundum for superior maxillary nerve, Foramen ovale for inferior maxillary & small superficial petrosal nerves and small meningeal artery, (on inner side of which latter foramen is sometimes seen Foramen Vesalii for a small vein), Foramen spinosum for middle meningeal artery, Foramen lacerum medium- closed with cartilage. On Anterior Surface of Petrous Bone : Internal orifice of carotid canal. Depression for Casserian ganglion, Grooves to Hiatus Fallopii for large superficial petrosal nerve and to a smaller and more external opening for small superficial petrosal nerve; frequently Two other small foramina for small petrosal branch of glosso-pharyngeal and branch of glosso-pharyngeal to large superficial petrosal nerve, Eminence corresponding to superior semi-circular canal, on outer sids ol which is a Depression corresponding to cavity of tympanum.

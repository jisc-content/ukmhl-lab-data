â€¢ TABLETS OF ANATOMY. BY THOMAS COOKE, F.R.C.S., Eng. B.A., B.Sc., M.D., Paris. SENIOE ASSISTANT SURGEON TO THE WESTMINSTER HOSPITAX, AND LECTURER AT THE SCHOOL OF ANATOMY, PHTSIOLOGY, AND SURGERY. Being a Synopsis of Demonstrations given in the Westminster Hospital Medical School in the Years 1871, -72, -73, -74, -75. EIGHTH THOUSAND, BEING A SELECTION OF THE TABLETS BELIEVED TO BE MOST USEFUL TO STUDENTS GENEEALLY. " The schemes of any of the arts or sciences may be analysed in a sort of skeleton, and represented upon tables, with the various dependencies and connections of the several parts and subjects that belong to them; and the frequent review of these abstracts and epitomes would tend much to imprint them on the brain, when they have been once well learned; this would keep those learned traces always open, and assist the weakness of a labouring memory." ISAAC WATTS, D.D., ON ''The Improvement of the Mind." LONGMANS, GREEN, & CO., PATERNOSTER ROW, LONDON. 1889. ALL BIGHTS RESERVED. 1 Price 7/6.

AURICLIj — Divided, as is the right, into two parts, the Appendix Auriculae - Longer, narrower, more curved & indented than on right side, eud constricted at its orifice; its mnsculi pectinati are smaller & less numerous.

Sinus - More regularly cuboid than on right side. - Presents: Openings op the Pulkonary veins - Four, at upper part, two on the right clo?e to septum, two on the left, the latter sometimes uniting.

The chordae tendinese attached to its under surface are stronger & thicker, but are less numerous, than those on the right side. Aortic Opening - Situated behind centre of sternum on a level with lower border of 3rd costal cartilage, and directly in front of the left auriculo-ventri- cular opening. Presents the Semilunar Valves - Larger, thicker & stronger than those of pulmonary artery; lunulae wider, corpora Arantii more prominent, and sinuses of Valsalva deeper. CoLUMNiE Carney - Those attached by one side and those attached by both extre- mities are smaller & more numerous.

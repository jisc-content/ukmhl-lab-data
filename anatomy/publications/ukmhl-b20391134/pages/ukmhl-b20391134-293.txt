281 THE SPINAL CORD Extends from point of decussation of anterior pyramids (which point corresponds pretty nearly to the upper border of the atlas) to lower border of body of first lumbar vertebra, where it terminates in a slender filament, the filum terminale, which descends for a short distance into the ligamentum centrale. Is from 15 to 18 inches long & slightly flattened from before backwards. Presents two enlarge - ments, the cervical and the lumbar. The cervical, the larger, extends from the third cervical to the first dorsal vertebra, and is widest from side to side j the lumbar, the smaller, is situated opposite the last dorsal vertebra, and is widest from before backwards. Presents fissures and columns, FISSURES: Antero-Median-Wider than the posterior, and penetrates to about one third of the thickness of the cord, its depth increasing slightly infer, iorly. It contains a well-marked prolongation of the pia mater, and is bounded behind by the anterior or white commissure. Postero-Median - Narrower than the anterior. It penetrates to the very centre of the cord, is most marked above and below, and contains but a very delicate process of pia mater. It is bounded in front by the posterior or grey commissure. Antero-Lateral (So-called) - Consist simply of a linear series of fora. mina corresponding to the points of emergence of the anterior roots of the spinal nerves. Postero-Lateral ^ Correspond to the line of attachment of the posterior roots, and lead down to the grey matter. Postero-Inteemediary (Hirschfeldt, Sappey) - Two delicate longitudinal furrows situated on either side of the postero-median fissure and most marked in the cervical region. COLUMNS - Are demarcated by the fissures, ana are termea Anterior, Lateral, Posterior and Postero-Median - The two formei being usually joined under the name of antero-lateral, and the postero- median being usually included in the posterior.

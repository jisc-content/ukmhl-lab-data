2 THE VERTEBE^. Present for examination; - Body - Forms a short columii, which presents; Ant. Surface - Convex from side to side, concave from above downwards; presents numerous small vascular foramina. Post. Surface - Concave from side to side, fiat from above downwards; presents one or more irregular apertures for exit of venae basis vertebrae. Upper & Under Surfaces - Eough & slightly concave, and surrounded by a pro- minent rim. Pedicles - Join the body to the laminai. They are constricted, and their constriction gives rise to the Notches - Which latter, by the superposition of the vertebrae, form the intervertebral fora- iiiina. Laininse Broad & flat, rough above & below for the ligamenta subflava; bound posteriorly the Foramen - Which, by the superposition of the vertebrae, forms the spinal canal. Spinous process - Projects backwards from the point of junction of tho lamina3. Transverse processes - Two. Project outwards from the sides of the arch. Articular processes - Pour. Project upwards & downwards from the point of junction of the pedicles with the laminse. The superior ones look backwards, the inferior ones look forwards. II, â€” But little, which would be applicable to each of the three groups of vertebrae, can, it is believed, be added to this description.

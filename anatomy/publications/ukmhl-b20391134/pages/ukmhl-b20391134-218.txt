MUSCLES. ORIGINS. Internal & Inferior Recti & Lower Head of External Rectus - Incomplete fibrous ring termed the ligament of Zinn, which surrounds optic foramen, except at its upper & outer ppi fc. - jLower head of external rectus also arises from a small spine on orbital surface of greater wing of sphenoid. Superior Rectus & Upper Head of External Rectus - Upper margin & upper part of outer margin of optic foramen. Levator Falpebrse Superioris - Under surface of lesser wing of sphenoid in front of optic foramen & externally to superior oblique. Superior Oblique - Under surface of lesser wing of sphenoid in front of optic foramen & internally to levator palpebrae superioris. Inferior Oblique - Depression on orbital plate of superior maxilla close to lachrymal groove. INSERTIONS. The Four Recti - Fore part of sclerotic about four lines from cornea. Superior & Inferior Oblique - Upper & outer part of sclerotic between superior & external recti and midway between cornea & optic nerve. Levator Falpebrse Superioris - Upper border of superior tarsal cartilage.

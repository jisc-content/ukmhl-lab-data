177 FACIAL ARTERY. Arises above lingual beneath thin anterior margin of sterno-mastoid. Forwards & upwards beneath posterior belly of digastric & stylo-hyoid & submaxillary gld. Crosses jaw bone in front of masseter. Forwards and upwards to angle of mouth upon buccinator & beneath platysma. Upwards beneath zygomatici and upon levator anguli oris and the levators of the lip & ala of the nose to inner canthus, where becomes angular artery and joins with ophthalmic. Is very tortuous in its course. Facial vein lies behind it, and is less tortuous. Gives off branches: Inferior or Ascending Palatine - Dips beneath ramus of jaw. Ascends between stylo-glossus & -pharyngeus and then upon superior constric- tor in front of ascending pharyngeal, and supplies tonsil & soft palate. Tonsillar - Ascends upon and perforates sup. constrictor to tonsil & root of tongue. Submaxillary - Three or four, to submaxillary gland & surrounding muscles. Submental - Forwards on under surface of mylo-hyoid, and between it and digastric to symphysis, where ascends upon chin. Inf. Labial - Forwards beneath depressor anguli oris, below following artery to tissues of lower lip. Inf. Coronary - Forwards beneath depressor anguli oris, and tortuous course through substance of orbicularis and between it & mucous membrane, anastomosing with its fellow. Sup. Coronary - Larger and more tortuous; similar course along free edge of upper lip, giving twigs to ala and artery of septum to septum of nose. Lateralis Nasi - To ala and dorsum of nose. Angular - To inner canthus, supplying lachrymal sac and anastomosing with nasal branch of ophthalmic. All these branches anastomose freely with each other, with those of the oppo- site side, and with the mental, transverse facial, infra-orbital, ophthal- mic, sublingual, posterior superior or descending palatine and ascending pharyngeal arteries.

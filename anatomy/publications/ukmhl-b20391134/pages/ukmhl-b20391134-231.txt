219 THE TWO FIRST SPINAL NERVES. POSTERIOR DIVISION OF First Cervical Nerve (Suboccipital) - Larger than anterior. Emerges between occipital bone & posterior arch of atlas just behind vertebral artery, enters triangle formed by small poster- ior cranio-vertebral muscles, supplies these muscles & complexas, and joins wich posterior divisioa of 2nd cervical nerve. Sometimes gives off a small cutaneous branch, which branch, when it exists, accompanies occipital artery to integument of lower & back part of occiput, and joins with gi'oat & small occipital. Second Cervical Nerve - Three or four times as large as anterior division, and the largest of the posterior cervical nerves. Emerges between posterior arch of atlas & lamina of axis, supplies infer- ior oblique, and after joining with posterior division of 1st & 3rd cervical nerves, divides into: External Branch - Similar to external branches of six lower posterior cervical nerves, but somewhat larger, joins with corresponding branch of 3rd posterior cervical nerve, and supplies the same muscles, & also the complexas. Internal Branch (Great Occipital Nerve) - Grosses triangle formed by posterior cranio-vertebral muscles, pierces complexus & trapezius, joins with small occipital & with ascending twig from internal branch of posterior division of 3rd, and supplies integument of back of head as far aa vertex J gives off an auricular branch to back of ear. ANTERIOR DIVISION OF First Cervical Nerve (Suboccipital) - Small. Emerges between occipital bone & posterior arch of atlas below vertebral artery. Passes forwards on mner side ot vertebral artery & rectus lateralis muscle, crosses foramen in transverse process of atlas, and descends in front of this process to join with ascending branch of the second. Supplies the rectus lateralis & the recti capitis antici major & minor, and communicates with the pneumogastric, hypoglossal, & superior cervical ganghon ot sympathetic. Becond Cervical Nerve - Larger than foregoing, but still much smaller than the poster, becona V^f ^Ica^^lN ei^^^^^^ S^^^^^ ^ ^^^^^^ between posterior arch of atlas & lamma of axis, passes forwards between transverse processes of the same vertebrae on outer side of vertebral artery, and divides into an ascending branch, which joins the first nerve, and a descending branch, whit»\ pfia the second.

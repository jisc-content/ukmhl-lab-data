172 BUS. of DISTRIB. of the CERV. G. of the SYMPATHETIC. These ganglia give off branches to the neighbouring arteries and to the viscera as follows s BRS. to the NEIGHBOURING ARTERIES: SUP. CERVICAL GANGLION - Gives off: ASCENDING BRANCH to INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY & its BRANCHES — Large, soft, of a reddish grey colour, and appears to be the direct continua- tion of the ganglion. It passes along the posterior aspect of internal carotid artery and divides on reaching the carotid canal into internal & external branches. Inteenal Branch - The smaller; ascends on inner side of internal carotid artery, communicating with the outer branch, and goes to form the greater part of the cavernous plexus. External Branch - The larger j ascends on outer side of internal carotid artery, communicating with the inner branch, and goes to form the greater part of the carotid plexus. ANTERIOR BRANCHES to EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY & its BRANCHES — Form delicate plexuses which accompany the external carotid artery dr' its branches, and on the filaments of which small ganglia are sometimes found. - From the plexus on the trunk of the external carotid artery a communica- ting branch is given off to the digastric branch of the facial nerve; from the plexus on the facial artery is derived the sympathetic root of the sub« maxillary ganglion; from the plexus on the internal maxillary artery is derived the sympathetic root of the otic ganglion and also a twig to the intumescentia gangliformis of the facial. MIDDLE CERVICAL GANGLION - Gives off: THYROID BRANCHES — Accompany the inferior thyroid artery, communicating with superior cardiac nerve, and reach the thyroid body, in which they communicate with the recurrent & external laryngeal nerves. INF. CERVICAL GANGLION - Gives off: BRANCHES to VERTEBRAL ARTERY — Form a plexus round that vessel, and communicate with the cervical nerves as high as the 4th. BRS. to the VISCERA — Are the: Cardiac Nerves - Vide Next Tablet. Pharyngeal Branches of the Superior Cervical Ganglion ~ Join with the* pharyngeal branches oi the glosso-pJiaryngeal, pneumogastric, 6^ external laryngeal to form the pharyngeal plexus, which plexus supplies the muscles & the muooua membrane of the pharynx. Thyroid Branches of the Middle Cervical Ganglion - Vide above,

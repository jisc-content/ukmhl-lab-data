135 THE PELVIC FASCIA. Is continuous with fascia over psoas & iliacus and with fascia transversalis, and is slightly adherent to brim of pelvis, especially at sides. It is thin posteriorly, where it covers pyriformis muscle & cacral plexus, and passes behind internal iliac vessels which perforate it. In front it forms a single thick layer over obturator internus as low down as a white linear thickening, which linear thickening extends in a curved direction from apiue ol ischium to side of lower part of symphysis pubis, and both gives attachment to middle fibres of levator ani, and marks point of division of pelvic fascia into recto- vesical & obturator layers, or recto-vesical & obturator fasciae. . Eecto-Vesical Fascia- Is continued over inner surface of levator ani to bladder, prostate or vagina, & rectum. In front it forms anterior true ligaments of bladder, or pubo-prostatic ligaments. Further back it ascends over side of prostate, inclosing this gland & the prostatio plexus of veins, and is then continued on the bladder forming its lateral true ligaments. Posteriorly it sends a prolongation between the bladder & rectum, which prolong, ation invests the vesiculae seminales. Obturator Fascia - Descends on portion of obturator internus muscle which lies beneath levator ani, and becomes attached to pubic arch & sacro-sciatic ligaments. It forms a canal for pudic vessels & nerve, and gives off a thin layer, the anal or ischio-rectal fascia, to under surface of levator ani & to third part of rectum.

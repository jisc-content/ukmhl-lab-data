291 TABLEAU of the FIFTH NERVE. From side of pons Varolii by two roots, anterior small or tnoior, posterior inr^ or xnsory. Sensory root to Gasserian Ganglion, motor root to inferior maxillary nerve outside cianium. Gasserian Ganglion gives off.* OPHTHALMIC — The smallest. Through outer wall of cavemons sinus below & externally to the other nerves, and divides into: Lachrymal - The smallest of the three divisions of ophthalmic. Feontal - The largest. Nasal - Intermediate in size. Gives off branches: ganglionic^ long ciliary, in- fratrochlear. Ophthalmic, Ciliary or Lenticular Ganglion. Thkbe Roots - Sensory, from nasal branch of ophthalmic* Motor, from branch'of^rd nerve to inferior oblique* Sympathetic, from cavernous plexus. Branches - The ciliary nerves, SUFSIilOK MAXILARY — Intermediate in size between ophthalmic & infer- ior maxillary. Through foramen rotundum, spheno-maxillary fossa, & infraorbital canal to infraorbital foramen, where divides into palpebral, nasal, labial. Gives off branches: orbital or temporo'fnalar^ spheno-palatine, posterior & anterior dental, Spheno-palatine or MeekePs Ganglion. Three Roots - Sensory, from superior maxillary. Motor, from facial through vidian. Sympathetic, from carotid plexus also through vidian. Branches : Ascending - Small filaments to periosteum of orbit. Descending - Anterior or great palatine, external palatine, posterior of small palatine. Internal - Superior nasal, naso-palatine. Posterior - Vidian, pterygo-palatine. INFERIOR MAXILLARY — The largest, both sensory & motor. Divides jnst below base of skull into: Anterior or Smaller Division - Principally motor. Divides into branches: masseteric, two deep tempoi'al, buccal, two pteiygoid. Posterior or Larger Division - Sensory with a few motor fibres. Divides into auriculo-tomporalj gustatory, inferior dental, the latter giving off the mylo-hyoid branch. Otic or Arnold's Ganglion. Three Roots - Sensory, from auriculo-temporal, and also from glosso- pharyngeal through small petrosal. Motor, from inferior maxillary & its internal pterygoid branch, also from facial through small petrosal. Sympathetic, from plexus on middle meningeal artery. Branches - To tensor palati & tensor tympani. Submaxillary Ganglion. Three Roots - Sensory, from gustatory. Motor, from facial through chorda tympani. Sympathetic, from plexus on facial artery. Branches - To mucous membrane of mouth, Wharton's duct, h anbmax- ;ills y gland.

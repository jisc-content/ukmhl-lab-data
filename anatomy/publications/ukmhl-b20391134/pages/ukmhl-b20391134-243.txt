231 INTERNAL MAMMARY ARTERY. - From under surface of subclavian, opposite thyroid axis. Downwards behind phrenic nerve aiid interna] jug'ular & subclavian veins to pos- terior aspect of costal cartilages a short distance from sternum^ Descends between thoracic wall & pleura, giving off branches : - Perforating, Anterior Intercostal, Anterior Mediastinal, drÂ» Comes Nervi Phrenici, and divides between 6th & 7th costal cartilages & beneath triangularis sterni into branches Musculo'phrenic, ^ Superior Epigastric. Its two venae comites unite into one trunk before they open into the innominate. Perforating - Forwards through five or six upper intercostal spaces to pectoralis major, integument, and mamma. AsTBBioR Intercostal > Outwards in five or six upper intercostal spaces between internal intercostal muscles & pleura, and divide between internal & ex- ternal intercostal muscles into superior & inferior branches which inoscu- late with corresponding branches of corresponding aortic intercostals, - and are similarly distributed. Anterior Mediastinal - Small, irregular ; to pericardium, remains of thymus gland & cellular tissue of anterior mediastinum. Comes Nervi Phrenici (Superior Phrenic) - From upper part of artery. Long, slender; with phrenic nerve to diaphragm, and anastomose with musculo-phrenic, & inferior phrenic from abdominal aorta. Musculo-Phrenic - Downwards & outwards behind cartilages of false ribs, supplying diaphragm, which it perforates opposite 8th or 9th rib, & abdominal muscles, and giving off a small anterior intercostal branch to each of the lower intercostal spaces, Superior Epigastric - Enters sheath of rectus posteriorly, and anastomoses with epi- gastric branch of external iliac, lower intercostals & lumbar; gives twigs to rectus & to iuteguuaeut of middlo lino of abdomen

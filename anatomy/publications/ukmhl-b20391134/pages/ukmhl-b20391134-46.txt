AXILLARY ARTERY From outer border of first rib to lower bordei of tendons of teres major & latissimua dorsi, being either straight or slightly curved upwards or downwards according to position of limb, and lying deeply at its origin & superficially at its termination. May be divided into three parts: First Part - Above pectoralis minor; rests upon thoracic wall. ' Second Part - Behind pectoralis minor; passes obliquely from thorax to arm. Third Part - Below pectoralis minor j lies on inner side of neck of humerus. RELATIONS: FIRST PART: In peont -â–  Pectoralis major, oosto-coracoid membrane; cephalic & aero. mio-thoracic veins j external anterior thoracic nerve. Behind & on Inner Side - First intercostal space, first digitation of ser- ratus magnus, posterior thoracic nerve. On Inner Side & in Front - Axillary vein. On Outer Side - Brachial plexus. SECOND PART: In Front - Pectoralos'major & minor. Behind - Upper part of subscapularis & posterior cord of brachial plexus. On Inner Side - Axillary vein & inner cord. On Outer Side - Coraco-brachiaHs & outer cord. THIRD PART: In Front - Pectoralis major (except at lowest part), junction of the two heads of median nerve. Behind - Lower part of subscapularis, tendons of teres major & latissimua dorsi, musculo-spiral & circumflex nerves. On Inner Side - Axillary vein, inner head of median, ulnar, internal cutaneous & lesser internal cutaneous nerves. On Outer Side -> Pofjaco-brachialia^ outer head of median nerve, musculo. cutaneous nerve.

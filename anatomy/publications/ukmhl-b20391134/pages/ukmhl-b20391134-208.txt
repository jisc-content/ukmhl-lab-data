THE T0NGUE-2nd Tablet. MUSCULAR FIBRES. Form extrinsic & intrinsic mnsoles. EXTRmSIC MUSCLES Are the: Stylo-gloSSUS - Anterior & outer aspect of styloid process near its apex & stylo- maxillary ligament. Side of base of tongue externally to hyo-glossus, dividing into : Longitudinal portion - Forwards along side of tongue, and blends with lingualis inferior in front of hyo-glossus. Tbansverse portion - Decussates with hyo-glossus & with its fellow. Hyo-glossus - Side of body, lesser cornu & whole length of great cornu of hyoid bone ( basio-glossus, chondro-glossus, cerato-glossus). Side of under surface of tongue between stylo-glossus & lingualis inferior. Genio-hyo-gloSSUS - By a short tendon from superior genial tubercle on inner surface of boly of jaw-bone close to symphysis. Whole length of under surface of tongue internally to lingualis in- ferior, side of pharynx, body of hyoid bone. Palato-glossns or Constrictor Isthmi Paucium - Anterior surface of soft palate close to uvula. Side of base of tongue, blending with stylo-glossus. INTRINSIC MUSCLES Are the: Lingualis transversns ~ Median septum. Sides, and sides of dorsum. Forms the chief bulk of the tongue. Lingualis Superior - Stratum of longitudinal or slightly oblique fibres thickest ■ in front, and covering dorsum of tongue beneath the mucous membrane to which the individual fibres are attached. Lingualis Inferior - Longitudinal band of fibres along whole length of under surface of tongue between hyo-glossus & genio-hyo-glossus. Blends with stylo-glossus in front of hyo-glossus. Lingualis Perpendicular is-Set of vertical or slightly oblique fibres from central part of dorsum to sides of under surface, forming curves concave upwards & outwards. The outer parts, or cortex, of the tongue are firm, and consist mainly of longitudinal fibres j the central part, or nucleus, is softer, and cjflRifits mainly of transverse & vertical fibres intermingled with , , adipose tissue-

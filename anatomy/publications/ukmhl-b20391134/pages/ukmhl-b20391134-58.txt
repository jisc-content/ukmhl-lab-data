Adductor Pollicis or Metacarpo-phalangeal - Lower two-thirds of anterior sur- face of 3rd metacarpal bone. Inner side of base of first phalanx of thumb. - S. by deep branch of ulnar n. MS. of HYPO-THENAR EMINENCE or MS. of LITTLE FINGER. Palmaris Brevis - Annular ligament & inner edge of central palmar fascia.

MUSCLES of the CENTRAL PALMAR REGION. Lumbricales - First, and sometimes Second, from outer side of corresponding deep fiexor tendon. - Third and Fourth, from adjoining sides of 2nd & 3rd and 3rd & 4th deep flexor tendons respectively. Outer side of expansion of corresponding extensor tendon on back of first phalanges. - S., the two outer by median nerve j the two inner by deep branch of ulnar nerve. Palmar Interossei - Three. - They arise from palmar half of one side of the meta- carpal bone of one finger, and are inserted into the same side of the base of the first phalanx of the same finger & into the expansion of the extensor tendon which covers it. - They are situated respectively on the inner side of the 2nd metacarpal bone & index finger, and on the outer side of the 4th & 5th meta. carpal bones and corresponding ring & little fingers. They adduct these fingers towards an imaginary line drawn through the long or middle finger. - They are supplied by the deep branch of the ulnar nerve. Dorsal InteroSSei - Four - They arise by two heads from the adjacent sides of twd metacarpal bones, but more extensively from the side of that metacarpal bone, which corresponds to the finger into which the muscle is inserted. They are inserted into the corresponding side of the base of the first phalanx of the cor- responding finger & into the expansion of the corresponding extensor tendon. - They are situated respectively on the outer side of the 2nd metacarpal bone & index finger, on both sides of the 3rd metacarpal bone & middle finger, on the inner side of the 4th metacarpal bone & ring finger. The 1st dorsal interosseous muscle is larger than the others, and is sometimes called the abductor indicis; the radial artery passes between its two heads. - They abduct the fingers from an imaginary line drawn through the long or middle finger, - The^ are supplie4 by the deep branch of the ulnar nerve,

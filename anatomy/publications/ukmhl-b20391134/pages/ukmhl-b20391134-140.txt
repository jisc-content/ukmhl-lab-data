130 LUMBAR PLEXUS. Formed by anterior divisions of four upper lumbar nerves, and situated in substance of psoas, in front of transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrso. Narrow above, where it usually receives a small branch from last dorsal nerve ; broad below, where it is joined to the sacral plexus by a branch from 4th lumbar nerve & by lumbo. sacral nerve or cord, Its arrangment is as follows* - (Vide Quain's diagram). 1st Lumbar Nerve - Gives oS: Ilio-hypogastriCi Ilio-inguinaly Small part of Genito-crural. Communicating branch to 2nd Lumbar. 2nd Lumbar Nerve - Completes Genito-crural, - and gives off Greater fart of External Cutaneous, ^vl^ Communicating branch to 3rd Lumbar, from which communicating branch the Anterior Crural^ Obturator^ 6^ Accessory Obturator nerves (when the latter exists) are partly derived Srd Lumbar Nerve - Completes External Ciitaneous, and p;ives off Greater part of Anterior Crural, Obturator <£r» Accessory Obturator Nerves (when the latter exists), and a Coi7imuMcating branch to 4th Lumbar. 4th Lumbar Nerve - Completes Anterior Crural, Obturator, <Sr» Accessory Obturatof Nerves, (when the latter exists), and gives off a Large branch toLumbar, Vf^ioYi large branch forms with the latter nerve the LumbO'Sacral Nerve or CoriU

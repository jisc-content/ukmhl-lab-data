59 THE WRIST JOINT. Is a condyloid articulation. ARTICULAR SURFACES: The Condyle - Is formed by three bones, the scaphoid, semilunar, & cuneiform. The Eeceiving Cavity - Is formed by the under surface of the radius & by the trian- • gular fibro-cartilage of the inferior radio-ulnar articulation. - The under sur- face of the radius is divided by a linear elevation into two portions, the outer triangular, the inner quadrilateral, which portions correspond respectively to the scaphoid and the semilunar j the cuneiform articulates with the under surface of the triangular fibro-cartilage LIGAMENTS: External Lateral - Short strong band, from / Apex of styloid pi'ocess of radius to Outer side of scaphoid ^ trapezium, anterior annular ligament of carpus. Internal Lateral - Round cord, from Apex of styloid process of ulna to ' ' - Cuneiform 63^ pisiform bones, <2r* anterior annular ligament. Anterior -Strong & broad membrane, from Front of head op ulna, anterior margin of radius dr» its styloid process to Scaphoid, sefnihmar, cuneiform, dr* slightly to os jnagnum. Posterior - Thinner, from Posterior margin of radius to Scaphoid, semilunar cSr* cuneiform. VASCULAR & NERVE SUPPLY — Anterior & posterior carpal branches cf radial & ulnai", anterior & posterior interosseous arteries, ascending branches of deep palmar arch,-Ulnarnerve MOVEMENTS — All but rotation.

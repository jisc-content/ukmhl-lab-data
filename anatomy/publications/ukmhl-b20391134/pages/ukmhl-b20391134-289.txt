277 THE PEDUNCLES of the CEREBELLUM. Superior, or Processus e Cerebello ad Testes - Arises in the lamm^ of the inferior vermiform process and also in the intei'ior of the corpus dentatura, passes upwards & inwards on either side of the middle line, being joined to its fellow by the valve of Yieussens, and ascends beneath the tubercula quadrigemina to the crura cerebri & optic thalarai, partly decussating in the middle line. Middle, Processus e Cerebello ad Pontem or Crus Cerebelli - The great transverse commissure of the cerebellum. Connects the laminee of the lateral parts of one hemisphere to the corresponding laminae of the opposite side, and forms the pons Varolii & the deep transverse fibres of the mesocephalon. Inferior, or Processus e Cerebello ad Medullam - If traced from below upwards, it may be said to proceed from all three columns of the cord, ?.<?., from the postero-external bundles of the anterior & middle columns, & from the fasciculus cuneatus or external bundle of the posterior column, the latter bundle being much the largest of the three. It ends in the laminse of the middle part of the cerebellum, especially in those of the upper surface.

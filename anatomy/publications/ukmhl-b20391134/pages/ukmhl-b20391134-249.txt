Behind - Same, plus oesophagus & thoracic duct. OnlitiierS.-Tra,ch.ea, sesophagus, thoracic duct, left common carotid artery. On OuterS.-'Pleura,. BRANCHES — Vertebral, Internal Mammary, Thyroid Axis - Arise close together near inner border of scalenus anticus, an interval measuring usually from J an inch to 1 inch being left between the origin of the artery & its first branch.

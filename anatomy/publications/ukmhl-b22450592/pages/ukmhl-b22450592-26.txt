Andrew Murray on the 20 in their turn, they so exactly resemble the Carniolan species Adelops Milleri and Adelops Freyeri, that the same may be said of them. Here, according to my view, the creative influence, acting under the same conditions, produces the same results—that is, produces creatures as nearly identical as can be without being the same. Nature never repeats herself; and we could not, therefore, expect the very same. And the inference I draw receives a double confirmation from the fact, that a great many of the European caves may be viewed as thoroughly isolated, and as free from communication as the Kentucky from the Carniolan; and I know of instances in which the inhabitants of such caves are not specifically distinct —the Auvergne species from the Pyrenean, the Pyrenean from the Carniolan, and so on. I may therefore say, that in the case of these caves we have a subterranean region as distinct and well defined as any purely geographical region in the upper world. Whether we may find other species of Anoph- thalmus or Adelops in the caves of Australia, or in caves yet to be discovered in tropical countries, is another question, and one which would not necessarily much affect the view I have taken, even although the species which might there be found should belong to new genera; for, in the first place, there may be more genera yet to be discovered in Europe—(I have no doubt there are)—and already we know several European genera Avhich have not been found in America, and the con- verse may in all probability be yet found to be the case with regard to America; so that the mere discovery of a new form would go for nothing—the rather that our knowledge of the fauna of the subterranean region is as yet too limited to allow us to say whether a new form bears its facies or not; and, in the second place, the temperature, or, what is still more likely to affect the fauna of caves, the degree of moisture, may be sufficient to constitute a different class of subterranean region. The European and American is a wet subterranean, the Aus- tralian may very probably be a dry one; but if it should prove not to have different conditions, I then should most confidently look for the occurrence in them of new species of the European genera, Anophthalmus and Adelops. Another region, sui generis, may be adduced as possess-

24 Andrew Murray on the can have little difficulty in suggesting some of the specialties which may have given rise to different marine regions. The difference between the extent of sea and dry land in different parts of the globe, the greater depth and wider extent of the sea in the south, the different distribution of land, the dif- ferent ingredients of which the shores are composed, combined with temperature, depth, climate, weather, currents, and pos- sibly even some small difference in the relative proportions of the chemical constituents of the sea itself,â€”all must operate in affecting the phenomena of life and creation ; and it is through the influence of such particulars that we can explain the differences of type in the marine fauna and flora of seas separated from each other only by a few miles of land as, for instance, the Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico at the Isthmus of Panama, or the Mediterranean and Red Seas at the Isthmus of Suez. If there be any such law, it must have been in operation during past geological epochs as well as at the present time; and wherever we can find any stratum containing animal and vegetable remains, marked by a similar facies to that of the animals and vegetables which we now find in any existing region, surely we may draw from them a tolerably correct inference as to the climate and nature of the country in which such bygone forms once lived. If we find, for ex- ample, that the fauna and flora of the oolitic period bears a certain resemblance in facies or type to the present fauna and flora of Australia, we may assume that those regions of which the oolitic strata are the debris bore in their time a correspond- ing amount of resemblance in physical condition to the pre- sent state of Australia. So much for similar conditions of locality producing similar plants and animals. It remains to consider what are the con- ditions wThicli so influence the creative or vital powers, and how they operate. Can my suggestion of the attraction of resemblance to the character of the birthplace have any bear- ing here X Its application is certainly less apparent, but, I should say, may still exist. We must remember that there may be, and no doubt are, many points of resemblance which our faculties are unable to appreciate, but which yet exist;

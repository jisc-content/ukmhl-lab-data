9 Disguises of Nature. lias probably overlooked the half of them. The green and brown hues, imitative of every variety which foliage as- sumes, speak for themselves, and I therefore pass them over; merely repeating, that the number of insects so coloured is beyond calculation. But it is not only in the perfect state that these animals exhibit this persistency of imitation ; their larvse are, if less universally, not less strangely and success- fully metamorphosed. Look at the larva of the peacock-moth, and see how exactly the general ground-colour harmonises with that of the young buds of heather on which it feeds, and how closely the pink spots with which it is decorated corre- spond with the flowers and flower-buds. I should say that one half of the caterpillars of moths and butterflies are green, closely resembling the hue of the leaf on which they feed ; and when a part of the body only is exposed to view, the resemblance is often restricted to that part, as may be seen in the larva of one of our tiger-beetles (Cicindela campestris), which lives in a hole, from which its head and thorax alone protrude; and these are of the same green as the perfect insect, while the rest of the body is of the usual whitish-yellow of a grub. There are few gar- deners who have not in their time been surprised to find that they have taken a fleshy caterpillar between their fingers when they have thought to break off a dead twig; the geo- meters, or loopers, having the strange habit of stretching them- selves out stiff and stark like a twig on the shrub or tree on which they feed; and as, like a vast number of the insect tribes, each is pretty much confined to one plant, or family of plants, for its food, we find that the resemblance is carried out to the extent of making the insect resemble the twigs of the particular plant on which it feeds, and, to add to the decep- tion, is embossed at suitable intervals with one or two emi- nences, made to imitate the buds on the side of the twig. Among the denizens of the waters we certainly do not find so many instances of disguise; still we are by no means with- out examples. In one small crustacean, Caprella pJiasma, which in these days of tanks and vivaria must be familiar to many of my readers, exactly the same habit is repeated which we have found among the loopers. It is a linear animal, about half an inch in length, semi-transparent, and of the same B

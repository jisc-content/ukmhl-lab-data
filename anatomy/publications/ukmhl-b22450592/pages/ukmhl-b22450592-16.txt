Andrew Murray on the 10 colour and consistency as a zoophyte, such as an Antennaria or Plumularia. If put alive into a tank containing a bunch of these zoophytes, it fixes itself among them by its hind legs ; and stretching out its body, and every limb and joint, as stiff and rigid as iron, it requires a careful examination to be able to detect it. Among the marine annelides, too, we find the hue of the green, purple, and red sea-weeds exactly reproduced in Nemertis and Planarice, &c. The mollusca do not furnish such striking instances of resemblance to particular objects— the amount of concealment shown in the sea-shells being chiefly confined to veiling the glowing colours of the shell under a coarse yellow epidermis, which corresponds in colour to the bottom of the sea on which they lie. Not that we arc absolutely without instances of the place of life correspond- ingly affecting the colour, as for instance in the Patella pel- lucida and the Patella ccerulea, the former of which is dark, and of the colour of the frond of the large Laminaria, on which only it is found ; and the latter, which is confined to the stalk, is paler, and of its hue:—an instance, however, on which I put no weight, because it may be pled that both the P. ccerulea and P. pellucida are the same species, modified by food; and where we have an emharras des richesses in the choice of un- challengable illustrations in other classes, it is unnecessary to burden ourselves with the defence of doubtful examples in this. Of the lower animals, the Actiniae furnish some good examples of disguise. I can hardly suggest a more perfect one than Actinia troglodytes in a sandy pool, its tentacles being so exactly marbled like a sandy bottom, that the pool may be paved with them all expanded, and yet the casual observer— ay, more, the attentive but uninstructed eye—never see one! The illustrations which I have thus far made use of are drawn from animals exhibiting these disguises permanently, and without variation ; but there is another class of imita- tors which I must not pass over, those which have as it were more than one disguise in their wardrobe—one for summer and another for winter ; as, for instance, the Alpine hare, the stoat or ermine, the ptarmigan, some grouse, &c.; and this a disguise which is made more or less perfect according to the severity of the winter, which is the accompaniment, I shall

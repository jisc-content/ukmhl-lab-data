On the Disguises of Nature : being an Inquiry into the Laws which regulate External Form and Colour in Plants and Animals. By Andrew Murray, F.ft.S.E* I have long thought that an inquiry into the laws by which the external—or what may be called the extrinsic—forms and appearance of organic objects are regulated, might worthily and profitably exercise the faculties of some of our deeper thinkers. It is a subject to which, so far as I know, nothing has been done ; at all events, no one has yet offered any ex- planation of what these laws are ; and we may even be said to be ignorant whether there he any such laws or not. In the hope that a statement of the subject may induce some one better qualified than mj^self to turn his attention to it, I propose to group together a few facts illustrative of some of the different aspects in which the subject may be regarded, and to indicate the interesting nature of the speculations to which they may give rise. One very curious branch of the subject, with which I shall begin, is the resemblance which certain plants and animals bear to other objects, animate or inanimate, as, for instance, an • insect to a leaf, a moth to a bee, &c. I have styled this the disguises of nature; a phrase which, although it does not apply to all the kinds of resemblance which I shall have to notice, sufficiently indicates their general nature. Other resem- blances, such as the general family resemblance in the facies of animals spread over a whole continent, or the resemblance to be found in species confined to a particular kind of locality, will also receive a portion of our consideration ; but these cannot be called disguises, and will fall to be discussed under a separate category. The disguise is usually one of two kinds. It is either an imitation of an animate or of an inanimate object. These we * Read before the British Association, Section D, September 1859. A

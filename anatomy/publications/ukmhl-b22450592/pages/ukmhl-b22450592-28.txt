Andrew Murray on the 22 ships; but it may be that the species is distinct, only that the characters are too slight to catch our eyes. At any rate, there is no doubt about the fact, that water-beetles are so close in structure to each other as to allow of only a very few genera, the great majority belonging only to a small number of distinct forms; and the chief difference appears to depend upon their being carnivorous or vegetable feeders. Again, there is a small beetle (uEpus fulvescens) found on our shores half-way be- tween high and low water mark, and which certainly passes more than the half of its existence under the sea. There are two or three others of similar mode of life, but I more particu- larly refer to this one. Its usual place of abode is between the flat strata or leaves of shale or other foliaceous rock; and it is provided with means of securing and enveloping itself in a sufficient supply of air to last during its submersion, so as to maintain life, and move about unwetted. On the coast of Chili, a similar small species (Thalassobius testaceus) is found living under the same conditions, and having the same facies as our JEpus ; sufficiently distinct to be made into a separate genus, but a genus taking its place next to sEpus. It may be said, that if my views on this point were really sound, we should in like manner find the fishes and mol- lusca of our own seas, and of those of Chili, &c., bearing the same type. But this by no means follows ; for observe, in the first place, we are here comparing an animal created to suit an abnormal condition with those in a normal con- dition, and it might be expected that the abnormal condi- tion would express itself more forcibly in any deviation of structure than the normal condition; and, in the second place, we are comparing land animals with sea animals, and we are not entitled to assume that the amount of variation in the condition of life necessary to influence the creative idea in the one is the same as that in the other; or that the same tests indicate the relative amount of variation in condi- tion of life in both. On the contrary, we have every reason to suppose that the reverse is the caseâ€”namely, that the creative idea in sea animals was (or is) influenced by a less amount of variation in the conditions of life than in land animals. In all animals and plants, the phenomena of life bear a perfect

Disguises of Nature. 15 but could not, or at all events could only by a more compli- cated and indirect route, apply to cases of temporary or sea- sonal variation. No original law of attraction by similarity could regulate the appearance of tlie variable hare at its creation, because such attraction could only affect it once; and if the hare were once created white or brown, its creation is over, and further change through that law at an end. But if we look upon the rule as subsisting not only at creation, but all through life, and as a great law or influence affecting life, then the subsequent changes of the hare from brown to white, and back again, are in accordance with it. The greater white- ness of all animals at the Poles is explainable ; we perceive under what law the fish or the bird assumes the hue of its feeding-ground, although we remain in ignorance of the modus operandi of the law. There is yet a further step, which the advocates of a modi- fication of species might not hesitate to takeâ€”viz., to abandon the idea altogether as a law of creation, and confine it to a rule of life. Combined with a belief in the modification of species, it might help us to see how, through its influence, so far as outward appearance is concerned, an Alpine hare might become the Arctic species ; how the desert locust might be de- rived from the common one; how a moth like a weather- beaten, lichen-encrusted rock, should proceed from one from the woods, and so on. There may be truth in the idea that changes in species do arise from the modifications of climate, food, &c.; but I confess that, in the present state of my in- formation on the subject, I am not inclined to look upon such instances as the above as cases where such modification has taken place, but rather as instances of the exercise of the ori- ginal law I have assumed, or of some other such law of equi- valent force and application ; and would hold, that while such law may be exercised co-ordinately and simultaneously with one producing a certain amount of modification of species, it cannot be substituted for such modifying principle ; still less can the instances of its operation be adduced as proofs of the existence of that principle. As I have already said, the fact of a great family resem- blance subsisting among all the creatures belonging to one

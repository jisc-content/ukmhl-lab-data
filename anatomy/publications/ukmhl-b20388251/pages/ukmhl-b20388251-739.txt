THE ABDOMEK. The oesophageal glands are numerous small compound glands, scattered through- out the tube; they are lodged in the submucous tissue, and open upon the surface by a long excretory duct. They are most numerous at the lower part of the tube, where they form a ring round the cardiac orifice. The Abdomen. The abdomen is the largest cavity in the body, and is separated, below, from the pelvic cavity by the brim of the pelvis. It is of an oval form, the extremities 329.—The Regions of the Abdomen and their Contents.

Boundaries.—It is bounded, in front and at the side*, by the lower ribs, the Transversalis muscle, and venter ilii; behind, by the vertebral column, and the Psoas and Quadratus lumborum muscles ; above, by the Diaphragm ; below, by the brim of the pelvis. The muscles forming the boundaries of the cavities are lined upon their inner surface by a layer of fascia, differently named according to the part to which it is attached. The abdomen contains the greater part of the alimentary canal; some of the accessory organs to digestion, viz., the liver, pancreas, and spleen; and the kidneys and suprarenal capsules. Most of these structures, as well as the wall of the cavity in which they are contained, are covered by an extensive and complicated serous membrane, the peritoneum.

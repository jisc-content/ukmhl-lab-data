646 THE THORAX. it is longer, narrower, and more cnrved than that of the right side, and its margins more deeply indented, presenting a kind of foliated appearance. Its direction is forwards and towards the right side, overlapping the root of the pnlmonary artery. In order to examine its interior, a horizontal incision should be made along the attached border of the auricle to the ventricle; and from the middle of this, a second incision should be carried upwards. The following parts then present themselves for examination : The openings of the four pulmonary veins. Auriculo-ventricular opening. Musculi pectinati. The pulmonary veins, four in number, open, two into the right, and two into the left side of the auricle. The two left veins frequently terminate by a common opening. They are not provided with valves. 353.â€”The Left Auricle and Ventricle laid open, the Anterior Walls of both being removed. The auriculo-ventricular opening is the large oval aperture of communication between the auricle and ventricle. It is rather smaller than the corresponding opening on the opposite side. The musculi pectinati are fewer in number and smaller than on the right side; they are confined to the inner surface of the appendix. On the inner surface of the septum aurieularum may be seen a hinated impres- sion, bounded below by a crescentic ridge, the concavity of which is turned up- wards. The depression is just above the fossa ovalis in the right auricle. The Left Ventricle is longer and more conical in shape than the right ven- tricle. It forms a small part of the left side of the anterior surface of the heart, and a considerable part of its posterior surface. It also forms the apex of the

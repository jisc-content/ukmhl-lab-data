128 THE SKELETON. Structure. It consists of dense cancellous tissue, covered by a thin compact lamina. Development. By a single centre, which makes its appear- , ance, according to Beclard, about the third year. In two instances, I have seen this bone cartila- ginous throughout, at a much later period (six years). More rarely, the bone is developed by two centres, placed side by side. Articulations. With the two condyles of the femur. Attachment of Muscles. The Rectus, Crureus, Vastus internus, and Vastus externus. These muscles joined at their insertion constitute the Quadriceps exten- sor cruris. The Tibia. (Figs. 109, no.) The Tibia is situated at the front and inner side of the leg, and, excepting the femur, is the longest and largest bone in the skeleton. It is prismoid in form, expanded above, where it enters into the knee-joint, more slightly enlarged below. In the male, its direction is vertical, and pa- rallel with the bone of the oppo- site side ; but in the female it has a slight oblique direction downwards and outwards, to compensate for the oblique direc- tion of the femur inwards. It presents for examination a shaft and two extremities. The Upper Extremity, or head, is large and expanded on each side into two lateral eminences, the tuberosities. Superiorly, the tuberosities present two smooth concave surfaces, which articu- late with the condyles of the femur ; the internal articular sur- face is longer than the external, and oval from before backwards, to articulate with the internal condyle ; the external one being broader, natter, and more circu- lar, to articulate with the ex- ternal condyle. Between the two articular surfaces, and nearer the posterior than the anterior 109.â€”Bones of the Right Leg. Anterior Surface. J I c a J Ejrtamnl ftTallcoius

374 ARTERIES. The branches of the ulnar artery may be arranged into the following groups, ("Anterior ulnar recurrent. Posterior ulnar recurrent. <^ _ , f Anterior interosseous.

Forearm. Wrist. Hand. The anterior ulnar recur- rent (fig. 220) arises im- mediately below the elbow- joint, passes upwards and inwards between the Bra- chialis anticus and Pronator radii teres, supplies those muscles, and, in front of the inner condyle, anasto- moses with the anastomo- tica magna and inferior profunda. The posterior ulnar re- current is much larger, and arises somewhat lower than the preceding. It passes backwards and inwards, be- neath the Plexor sublimis, and ascends behind the in- ner condyle of the humerus. In the interval between this process and the olecranon, it lies beneath the Flexor carpi ulnaris, ascending between the heads of that muscle, beneath the ulnar nerve; it supplies the neigh- bouring muscles and joint, and anastomoses with the inferior profunda, anasto- motica magna, and inter- osseous recurrent arteries (fig. 221). The interosseous artery (fig. 220) is a short trunk, about an inch in length, and of considerable size, which arises immediately below the tuberosity of the radius, and, passing back- wards to the upper border of the interosseous mem- brane, divides into two branches, the anterior and posterior interosseous.

ORGANS OF DIGESTION. 6zo The Large Intestine. The large intestine extends from the termination of the ilenm to the anns. It is about five feet in length, being one-fifth of the whole extent of the intestinal 336.—Patch of Peyer's Glands. 337-—A portion of the above magnified. From the lower part of the Ileum. canal. It is largest at its commencement at the caecum, and gradually diminishes as far as the rectum, where there is a dilatation of considerable size, just above the anus. It differs from the small intestine in its greater size, its more fixed position, and its sacculated form. The large intestine, in its course, describes an arch, which surrounds the convolutions of the small intestine. It commences in the right iliac fossa, in a dilated part, the caecum. It ascends through the right lumbar and hypochondriac regions to the under surface of the liver; passes transversely across the abdomen, on the confines of the epigastric and umbilical regions, to the left hypochondriac region ; descends through the left lumbar region to the left iliac fossa, where it becomes convoluted, and forms the sigmoid flexure; finally, it enters the pelvis, and descends along its posterior wall to the anus. The large intestine is divided into the caecum, colon, and rectum. The Ccecum (ccecus, blind) (fig. 338) is the large blind pouch, or cul-de-sac, in which the large intestine commences. It is the most dilated part of the tube, measuring about two and a half inches, both in its vertical and transverse diameters. It is situated in the right iliac fossa, immediately behind the anterior abdominal wall, being retained in its place by the peritoneum, which passes over its anterior surface and sides; its posterior surface being connected by loose areolar tissue with the iliac fascia. Occasionally, it is almost completely surrounded by peri- toneum, which forms a distinct fold, the meso-caecum, connecting its back part with the iliac fossa. When this fold exists the caecum obtains considerable freedom of movement. Attached to its lower and back part is the appendix vermiformis, a long, narrow, warm-shaped tube, the rudiment of the lengthened caecum found in all the mammalia, except the ourang-outang and wombat. The appendix varies from three to six inches in length, its average diameter being about equal to that of a goose-quill. It is usually directed upwards and inwards behind the caecum, coiled upon itself, and terminates in a blunt point, being retained in its position by a fold of peritoneum, which sometimes forms a mesentery for it. Its canal is small, and communicates with the cascum by an orifice, which is some-

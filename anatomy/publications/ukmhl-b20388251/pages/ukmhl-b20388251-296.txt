164 ARTICULATIONS. The posterior sternal ligament is disposed in a somewhat similar manner on the posterior surface of the articulation. IX. Articulation of the Pelvis with the Spine. The ligaments connecting the last lumbar vertebra with the sacrum are similar to those which connect the segments of the spine with each other, viz.:—1. The continuation downwards of the anterior and posterior common ligaments. 2. The intervertebral substance connecting the flattened oval surfaces of the two bones, and forming an amphiar thro dial joint. 3. Ligamenta subflava, connecting the arch of the last lumbar vertebra with the posterior border of the sacral canal. 4. Capsular ligaments connecting the articulating processes and forming a double arthrodia. 5. Inter- and supra-spinous ligaments. The two proper ligaments connecting the pelvis with the spine are the lumbo- sacral and lumbo-iliac. The Lumbosacral Ligament (fig. 127) is a short, thick, triangular fasciculus, which is connected above to the lower and front part of the transverse process of 128.—Articulations of Pelvis and Hip. Posterior View. the last lumbar vertebra, passes obliquely outwards, and is attached below to the lateral surface of the base of the sacrum, becoming blended with the anterior sacro- iliac ligament. This ligament is in relation in front with the Psoas muscle. The Lumbo-iliac Ligament (fig. 127) passes horizontally outwards from the apex of the transverse process of the last lumbar vertebra, to the crest of the ilium immediately in front of the sacro-iliac articulation. It is of a triangular form, thick and narrow internally, broad and thinner externally. It is in relation, in front, with the Psoas muscle; behind, with the muscles occupying the vertebral groove; above, with the Quadratus lumborum.

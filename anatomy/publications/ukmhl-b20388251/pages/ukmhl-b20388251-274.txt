Development op the Foot. (Fig. 115.) The Tarsal bones are each developed by a single centre, excepting the os calcis, which has an epiphysis for its posterior extremity. The centres make their appear- ance in the following order: in the os calcis, at the sixth month of foetal life ; in 115.—Plan of the Development of the Foot.

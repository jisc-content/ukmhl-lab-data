THE THORAX. 640 The pericardium is a fibro-serous membrane, and consists, therefore, of two layers : an external fibrous, and an internal serous. The fibrous layer is a strong, dense membrane. Above, it surrounds the great vessels arising from the base of the heart, on which it is continued in the form of tubular prolongations, which are gradually lost upon their external coats; the strongest being that which encloses the aorta. The pericardium may be traced, over these vessels, to become continuous with the deep layer of the cervical fascia. Below, it is attached to the central tendon of the Diaphragm; and, on the left side, to its muscular fibres. The vessels receiving fibrous prolongations from this membrane are the aorta, the superior vena cava, and the pulmonary arteries and veins. As the inferior 351.â€”Front View of the Thorax.

The serous layer invests the heart, and is then reflected on the inner surface of the pericardium. It consists, therefore, of a visceral and a parietal portion. The former invests the surface of the heart, and the commencement of the great vessels, to the extent of two inches from their origin ; from these, it is reflected upon the inner surface of the fibrous layer, lining, below, the upper surface of the central tendon of the Diaphragm. The serous membrane encloses the aorta and pulmo- nary artery in a single tube ; but it only partially covers the superior and inferior vena cava and the four pulmonary veins. Its inner surface is smooth and

OF THE ATLAS WITH THE AXIS. 153 variety of movement, flexion and extension especially being very free. Tn the dorsal region, especially at its upper part, the movements are most limited; flexion, extension, and lateral motion taking place only to a slight extent. II. Articulation of the Atlas with the Axis. The articulation of the anterior arch of the atlas with the odontoid process forms a lateral ginglymoid joint, whilst that between the articulating processes of the two bones forms a double arthrodia. The ligaments which connect these bones are, the Two Anterior Atlo-Axoid. Transverse. Posterior Atlo-Axoid. Two Capsular. Of the Two Anterior Atlo-Axoid Ligaments (fig. 117), the more superficial is a rounded cord, situated in the middle line ; it is attached, above, to the tubercle on the anterior arch of the atlas ; below, to the base of the odontoid process and body of the axis. The deeper ligament is a membranous layer, attached, above, to the lower border of the anterior arch of the atlas; below, to the base of the odontoid process, and body of the axis. These ligaments are in relation, in front, with the Recti antici majores. The Posterior Atlo-Axoid Ligament (fig. 118) is a broad and thin membranous layer, attached, above, to the lower border of the posterior arch of the atlas; n8,â€”Occipito-Atloid and Atlo-Axoid Ligaments. Posterior View. below, to the upper edge of the laminae of the axis. This ligament supplies the place of the ligamenta subflava, and is in relation, behind, with the Inferior oblique muscles.

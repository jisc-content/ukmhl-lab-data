ARTERIES. 326 clavicular articulation; the left from the highest part of the arch of the aorta. The left carotid is, consequently, longer and placed more deeply in the thorax. It will, therefore, be more convenient to describe first the course and relations of that portion of the left carotid which intervenes between the arch of the aorta and the left sterno-clavicular articulations (see fig. 205). The left carotid within the thorax ascends obliquely outwards from the arch of the aorta to the root of the neck. In front, it is separated from the first piece of the sternum by the Sterno-hyoid and Sterno-thyroid muscles, the left innominate vein, and the remains of the thymus gland; behind, it lies on the trachea, ceso- j phagus, and thoracic duct. Internally, it is in relation with the arteria innomi- nata; externally, with the left pneumogastric nerve, and left subclavian artery. Plan of the Relations op the Left Common Carotid.

Each vessel passes obliquely upwards, from behind the sterno-clavicular articulation, to a level with the upper border of the thyroid cartilage, where it divides into the external and internal carotid; these names being derived from the distribution of the arteries to the external parts of the head and face, and to the internal parts of the cranium respectively. The course of the common carotid is indicated by a line drawn from the sternal end of the clavicle below, to a point midway between the angle of the jaw and the mastoid process above. At the lower part of the neck the two common carotid arteries are separated from each other by a very small interval, which contains the trachea; but at the upper part, the thyroid body, the larynx and pharynx project forwards between the two vessels, and give the appearance of their being placed further back in that situation. The common carotid artery is contained in a sheath, derived from the deep cervical fascia, which also encloses the internal jugular vein and pneumo- gastric nerve, the vein lying on the outer side of the artery, and the nerve between the artery and vein, on a plane posterior to both. On opening the sheath, these three structures are seen to be separated from one another, each being enclosed in a separate fibrous investment. Relations. At the lower part of the neck the common carotid artery is very deeply seated, being covered by the superficial fascia, Platysma, and deep fascia, the Sterno-mastoid, Sterno-hyoid, and Sterno-thyroid muscles, and by the Omo-hyoid opposite the cricoid cartilage; but in the upper part of its course, near its ter- mination, it is more superficial, being covered merely by the integument, the superficial fascia, Platysma, and deep fascia, and inner margin of the Sterno- mastoid, and is contained in a triangular space, bounded behind by the Sterno- mastoid, above by the posterior belly of the Digastric, and below by the anterior

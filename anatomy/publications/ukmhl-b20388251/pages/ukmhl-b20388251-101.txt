ci SECRETING GLANDS. extremity, we have a compound racemose gland consisting of a single lobule terminating in its duct (such as Brunner's glands), and an aggrega- tion of such lobules may all open into a common duct, or may have a great number of separate ducts. Instances of such glands will be found in the salivary glands, the pancreas, &c. Or the necessary extent of epithelial surface may be obtained by the duct being coiled on itself, as in the sweat glands (Fig. XXXVIII. p. xc), or the extremity of the duct only may be thus arranged (seethe figure of the testis, p. 693). In other glands, as in the kidney, the mucous duct is undivided from the beginning, and the capillaries from which the secretion is to be eliminated are distributed upon its walls or project into its ampullated commencement (Fig. 268, p. 676). For the description of the Ductless or Blood Glands, we must refer to the sections in the text relating to the Anatomy of the Spleen, Suprarenal Capsules, Thyroid, and Thymus.

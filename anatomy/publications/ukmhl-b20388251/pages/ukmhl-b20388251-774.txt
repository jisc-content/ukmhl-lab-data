THE THORAX. 642 ventricle forms the greater portion of the anterior surface of the heart, and the left ventricle more of its posterior surface. Each of these cavities should now be separately examined. The Right Auricle is a little larger than the left, its walls somewhat thinner, measuring about one line ; and its cavity is capable of containing about two ounces. It consists of two parts, a principal cavity, or sinus, and an appendix auriculas. The sinus is the large quadrangular cavity, placed between the two venee cavse : its walls are extremely thin: it is connected below with the right ventricle, and internally with the left auricle, being free in the rest of its extent. The appendix av/riculce, so called trom its fancied resemblance to a dog's ear, is a small conical muscular pouch, the margins of which present a dentated edge. It projects from the sinus forwards and to the left side, overlapping the root of the pulmonary artery. To examine the interior of the auricle, a transverse incision should be made along its \. utricular margin, from its right border to the appendix; and, from the middle of this, a second incision should be carried upwards, along the inner side of the two venae cava3. The following parts present themselves for examination : Superior cava. Inferior cava. Openings. ^ Coronary Sinus. Valves. Foramina Thebesii. Auriculo-ventricular.

viii PREFACE TO THE FIFTH EDITION; himself. In order to make such verbal descriptions intelligible, figures are necessary: but it appeared useless to manufacture new drawings of things which are quite faithfully represented by authors who are in everybody's hands; and therefore all the illustrations to the chapter on General Anatomy have been borrowed from the English translation of Kolliker's 'Manual of Human Microscopic Anatomy,' from the ' Entwicklungsgeschichte' of the same author, Todd and Bowman's 'Physiology,' Harley and Brown's 4 Demon- strations of Microscopic Anatomy,' and other well-known works : the source of the drawings having been in each case acknowledged in the Table of Contents. The text has been further expurgated from errors of the press ; and the Editor has to acknowledge his obligations in this particular to his friend Professor Darling, of New York, and to Mr. Matthews, of Kirkclale, who have been kind enough to point out several, and some of them important, clerical errors which had escaped notice in previous revisions. 31 Claeges Street : September' 1869.

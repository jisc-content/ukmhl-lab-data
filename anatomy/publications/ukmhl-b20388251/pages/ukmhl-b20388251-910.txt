IO WORKS ON MEDICINE, SURGERY, &c. DICTIONARY OF CHEMISTRY AND THE ALLIED BRANCHES OF OTHER SCIENCES. By Henry Watts, F.R.S., Editor of the Journal of the Chemical Society, assisted by eminent Scientific and Practical Chemists. 5 vols. 8vo, £7 ^s. Two years have now elapsed since this Dic- tionary was completed, and nine years since the first volume was printed; and during these years large and important additions have been made both to the facts and to the theories of Chemical Science. To present these additions in a com- pendious form, it has been thought desirable to publish a Supplement to the Dictionary, bring- ing the record of Chemical discovery down to the end of the year 1869. The Supplement will form a volume of about 900 pages, and is expected to be ready in the course of the present year. The Author has been fortunate in se- curing the co-operation of several of his former Contributors, who have kindly consented to furnish additions to their articles.

GENERAL ANATOMY. xl the blood properly so called, is yellowish., and contains so much albumen that it solidifies almost completely on being heated. It is alkaline from the presence of free soda and carbonate of soda. The chemical composition of the blood is complex, as might be anticipated of a fluid from which all the various tissues of the body are to be formed; and it must of course vary in various parts of the circulation. The following seems to be as accurate an analysis as possible. It is quoted in the last edition of Fig. III.—Blood-crystals. A, Trihedral crystals from blood of guinea-pig. B, Pentagonal crystals from blood of squirrel. C, Octahedral crystals from blood of rat and mouse. ~D, Hsematin crystals from human blood. E, Heematoidin crystals from an old apoplectic clot. F, Haemin crystals from blood treated with acetic acid. Carpenter's < Physiology' by Power, from M. Gorrup-Bezanez, who pro- cured two samples of the same person's blood, and had them analysed by himself and three other competent chemists. The separate analyses are given, but the variations are too slight to be worth quoting. The follow- ing were M. Gorrup-Bezanez's results :— i st Spec. and Spec.

THE VASCULAR SYSTEM. lxxxi Fig. XXXIII.—Terminations of Motor-Nerves, according to Beale. i, Nerve-tuft on the sarcolemma of a muscular fibre; chameleon. Nerve-fibres are seen passing out of as well as into the tuft. 2, Nerve-fibres distributed to elementary muscular fibre; chameleon, X 3,000, and reduced half. This is a very simple form of i nerve tuft,' clearly external to the sarcolemma. 3, The intimate structure of a very simple 1 nerve tuft' on a muscular fibre of the chameleon. It will be observed that the nerve-fibres are continuous throughout, and that the whole is on the surface of the sarcolemma, X 3;ooo. This 'nerve tuft' is, as it were, but a compound network. THE VASCULAR SYSTEM. The vascular system, exclusive of its central organ, the Heart, is divided into four classes of vessels—the Arteries, Capillaries, Veins and Lymphatics—the minute structure of which we will now proceed briefly to describe, referring the reader to the body of the work for all that is necessary in the details of their ordinary anatomy. Structure of Arteries. The arteries are composed of three coats—■ internal serous, or epithelial coat (tunica intima of Kolliker), middle fibrous or circular coat and external cellular coat, or tunica adventitia. The two inner coats together are very easily separated from the external, as by the ordinary operation of tying a ligature on the artery. If a fine string be tied forcibly upon an artery, either before or after death, and then taken off, the external coat will be found uninjured, but e

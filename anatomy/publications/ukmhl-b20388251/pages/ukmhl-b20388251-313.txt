181 METACARPOPHALANGEAL. phalangeal articulations. Its anterior surface presents four grooves for the passage of the flexor tendons. Its 'posterior surface blends with the ligaments of the metacarpophalangeal articulation. X. Metacarpophalangeal Articulations. (Fig. 137.) These articulations are of the ginglymus kind, formed by the reception of the rounded head of the metacarpal bone, into a superficial cavity in the extremity of the first phalanx. They are connected by the following ligaments :— Anterior. Two Lateral. The Anterior Ligaments {Glenoid, ligaments of Cruveilhier) are thick, dense, 137.—Articulations of the Phalanges. LATERAL MCAWSENT and fibro-cartilaginous in tex- ture. Each is placed on the palmar surface of the joint, in the interval between the late- ral ligaments, to which they are connected ; they are loose- ly united to the metacarpal bone, but very firmly to the base of the first phalanges. Their palmar surface is in- timately blended with the transverse ligament, forming a groove for the passage of the flexor tendons, the sheath surrounding which is con- nected to each side of the groove. By their internal surface, they form part of the articular surface for the head of the metacarpal bone, and are lined by a synovial mem- brane. The Lateral Ligaments are strong rounded cords, placed one on each side of the joint, each being attached by one extremity to the tubercle on the side of the head of the metacarpal bone, and by the other to the contiguous ex- tremity of the phalanx. The posterior ligament is supplied by the extensor ten- don placed over the back of each joint. Actions. The movements which occur in these joints are flexion, extension, adduction, abduction, and circumduction ; the lateral movements are very limited. Artie Vf XI. Articulations of the Phalanges. These are ginglymus joints, connected by the following ligaments :— Anterior. Two Lateral. The arrangement of these ligaments is similar to those in the metacarpopha- langeal articulations; the extensor tendon supplies the place of a posterior ligament.

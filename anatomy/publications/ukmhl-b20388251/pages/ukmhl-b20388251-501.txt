RADIAL. 369 -The Surgical Anatomy of the Radial and Ulnar Arteries. muscles in the course of the artery. They supply the Coraco-brachialis, Biceps, and Brachialis anticus muscles. Radial Artery. The Radial artery appears, from its direction, to be the continuation of the brachial, but, in size, it is smaller than the ulnar. It commences at the bifurcation of the bra- chial, just below the bend of the elbow, and passes along the radial side of the fore- arm to the wrist; it then winds backwards, round the outer side of the carpus, be- neath the extensor tendons of the thumb, and, finally, passes forwards between the two heads of the first Dorsal interosseous muscle, into the palm of the hand, where it crosses the metacarpal bones to the ulnar border of the hand, to form the deep pal- mar arch. At its termination, it inosculates with the deep branch of the ulnar artery. The relations of this vessel may thus be conveniently di- vided into three parts, viz., in front of the forearm, at the back of the wrist, and in the hand. Relations. In the forearm, this vessel extends from op- posite the neck of the radius, to the fore-part of the sty- loid process, being placed to the inner side of the shaft of the bone, above, and in front of it below. It is super- ficial throughout its entire extent, being covered by the integument, the superficial and deep fascia, and slightly overlapped above by the Su- pinator longus. In its course downwards, it lies upon the tendon of the Biceps, the Supinator brevis, the Pronator radii teres, the radial origin of the Flexor sublimis di- gitorum, the Flexor longus pollicis, the Pronator quadra- tus, and the lower extremity of the radius.

The following table is translated from the work of Beaunis and Bou- chard, with some very unimportant alterations.* It will serve to present a resume of the above facts in an easily accessible form. * It will be noticed that the time assigned in this table for the appearance'of the first rudiment of some of the bones (e.g. the ilium), varies in some cases from that assigned on p. lviii. This is a point on which anatomists differ, and which probably varies in different cases.

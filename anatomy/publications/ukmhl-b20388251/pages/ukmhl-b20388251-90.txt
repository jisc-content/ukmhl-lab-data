GENERAL ANATOMY. xc The derma, or true shin, is tough., flexible, and highly elastic, in order to defend the internal parts from violence. It consists of fibro-areolar tissue, intermixed with numerous blood-vessels, lymphatics, and nerves. The fibro-areolar tissue forms the framework of the cutis ; it is composed of firm interlacing bundles of white fibrous tissue, intermixed with a much smaller proportion of yellow elastic fibres, the amount of which varies in different parts. The fibro-areolar tissue is more abundant in the Fig. XXXVIII.â€”A Sectional View of the Skin (magnified). deeper layers ot the cutis, where it is dense and firm, the meshes being large, and gradually becoming blended with the subcutaneous areolar tissue ; towards the surface, the fibres become finer and more closely interlaced, the most superficial layer being covered with numerous small conical vascular eminences, the papilla). From these differences in the structure of the cutis at different parts, it is usual to describe it as consisting of two layers ; the deeper layer or corium, and the superficial or papillary layer. The corium consists of strong interlacing fibrous bands, composed chiefly of the white variety of fibrous tissue ; but containing, also, some fibres of the yellow elastic tissue, which vary in amount in different parts. Towards the attached surface, the fasciculi are large and coarse; and the areola? which are left by their interlacement are large, and occupied by adipose tissue and the sweat-glands. This element of the skin becomes gradually Wended with the subcutaneous areolar tissue. Towards the free

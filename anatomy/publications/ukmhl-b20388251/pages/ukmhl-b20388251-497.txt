In the upper part of its course, the artery lies internal to the humerus ; but below, it is in front of that bone. Relations. This artery is super- ficial throughout its entire extent, being covered, in front, by the in- tegument, the superficial and deep fascia ; the bicipital fascia separates it opposite the elbow from the me- dian basilic vein ; the median nerve crosses it at its middle; and the basilic vein lies in the line of the artery, but separated from it by the fascia, in the lower half of its course. Behind, it is separated from the inner side of the humerus above, by the long and inner heads of the Triceps, the musculo-spiral nerve and superior profunda artery inter- vening ; and from the front of the bone below, by the insertion of the Coraco-brachialis muscle, and by the Brachialis anticus. By its outer side, it is in relation with the com- mencement of the median nerve, and the Coraco-brachialis and Bi- ceps muscles, which slightly over- lap the artery. By its inner side, its upper half is in relation with the internal cutaneous and ulnar nerves, its lower half with the median nerve. It is accompanied by two vensD comites, which lie in close contact with the artery, being connected together at intervals by short transverse communicating branches.

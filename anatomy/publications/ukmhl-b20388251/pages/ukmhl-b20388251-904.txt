Fourth Edition, corrected and partly re- written. 2 vols. 8vo, price 32J. "We need do little more than welcome the new edition of Mr. Lewes's History of Philosophy. The third edition, which appeared in 1867, was substantially a new work. The present volumes have been revised throughout; and much in them is new, especially those parts that refer to Gior- dano, Bruno, Leibnitz, Berkeley, Kant, Fichte, and Hegel. Mr. Lewes shows himself anxious to make his work as complete and accu- rate as possible, and it is certainly the best work on the subject that is within the student's reach. Mr. Lewes, of course, is not a friendly historian of metaphysical research; but he is an honest critic, and he points out very clearly the succes- sive and necessary blunders into which metaphy- sicians, from Thales to Hegel, have fallen in their attempts to probe the unfathomable, and to master the unknown and incomprehensible. That is work worth doing, and work that a Positivist is especially competent to do. The destructive criticism which Mr. Lewes has acquired in the school of Auguste Comte is welcome to many who do not agree with all the constructive work of Comte and his followers ; and this History of Philosophy may be studied with great profit by those who by no means agree with it " Examiner.

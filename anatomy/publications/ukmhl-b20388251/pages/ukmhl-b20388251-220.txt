THE SKELETON. 88 angle. The ridge serves for the attachment of a strong aponeurosis, which sepa- rates the Infraspinatus from the two Teres muscles. The surface of bone between this line and the axillary border is narrow in the upper two-thirds of its extent, and traversed near its centre by a groove for the passage of the dorsalis scapulae vessels ; it affords attachment to the Teres minor. Its lower third presents a broader, somewhat triangular surface, which gives origin to the Teres major, and 85.â€”Left Scapula. Posterior Surface, or Dorsum. over which glides the Latissimus dorsi; sometimes the latter muscle takes origin by a few fibres from this part. The broad and narrow portions of bone above alluded to are separated by an oblique line, which runs from the axillary border, downwards and backwards: to it is attached the aponeurosis separating the two Teres muscles from each other. The Sjoine is a prominent plate of bone, which crosses obliquely the inner four-fifths of the dorsum of the scapula at its upper part, and separates the

First Part of the Left Subclavian Arxert. (Fig. 205.) The left subclavian artery arises from the end of the transverse portion of the arch of the aorta, opposite the second dorsal vertebra, and ascends to the inner margin of the first rib, behind the insertion of the Scalenus anticus muscle. This vessel is, therefore, longer than the right, situated more deeply in the cavity of the chest, and directed almost vertically upwards, instead of arching outwards like the vessel of the opposite side. It is in relation, in front, with the pleura, the left lung, the pneumogastric, phrenic, and cardiac nerves, which lie parallel with it, the left carotid artery, left internal jugular and innominate veins, and is covered by the Sterno-thyroid, Sterno- hyoid, and Sterno-mastoid muscles; behind, it is in relation with the oesophagus, thoracic duct, inferior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic, Longus colli, and verte- bral column. To its inner side are the oesophagus, trachea and thoracic duct; to its outer side, the pleura. Plan of Relations of First Portion of Left Subclavian Artery. In front. Pleura and left lung.

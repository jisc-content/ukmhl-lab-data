ORGANS OF VOICE AND RESPIRATION. 668 The apex forms a tapering cone, which extends into the root of the neck, about an inch to an inch and a half above the level of the first rib. The base is broad, concave, and rests upon the convex surface of the Diaphragm; its circumference is thin, and fits into the space between the lower ribs and the costal attachment of the Diaphragm, extending lower down externally and behind than in front. The external or thoracic surface is smooth, convex, of considerable extent, and corresponds to the form of the cavity of the chest, being deeper behind than in front. The inner surface is concave. It presents, in front, a depression corresponding to the convex surface of the pericardium, and behind, a deep fissure (the hilum pulmonis) which gives attachment to the root of the lung. 366.â€”Front View of the Heart and Lungs. The posterior border is rounded and broad, and is received in the deep concavity on either side of the spinal column. It is much longer than the anterior border, and projects below between the ribs and the Diaphragm. The anterior border is thin and sharp, and overlaps the front of the peri- cardium. The anterior border of the right lung corresponds to the median line of the sternum, and is in contact with its fellow, the pleuree being interposed, as low as the fourth costal cartilage ; below this, the contiguous borders are separated by an irregularly shaped interval, formed at the expense of the anterior border of the left lung, and in which the pericardium is exposed.

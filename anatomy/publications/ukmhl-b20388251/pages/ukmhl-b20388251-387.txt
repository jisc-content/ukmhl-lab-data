ANTERIOR THORACIC REGION. 255 behind it; these proceed as far as the spinous processes of the dorsal vertebrae, to which they are attached. At the lower part of the thoracic region, this fascia is well developed, and is continuous with the fibrous sheath of the Recti muscles. Anterior Thoracic Region. Pectoralis Major. Pectoralis Minor. Subclavius. The Pectoralis Major (fig. 169) is a broad, thick, triangular muscle, situated at the upper and fore part of the chest, in front of the axilla. It arises from the 169.â€”Muscles of the Chest and Front of the Arm. Superficial View. anterior surface of the sternal half of the clavicle; from half the breadth of the front of the sternum, as low down as the attachment of the cartilage of the sixth or seventh rib; its origin consisting of aponeurotic fibres, which intersect with those of the opposite muscle ; it also arises from the cartilages of all the true ribs, with the exception, frequently, of the first, or of the seventh, or both ; and from the aponeurosis of the External oblique muscle of the abdomen. The fibres from this extensive origin converge towards its insertion, giving to the muscle a radiated appearance. Those fibres which arise from the clavicle, pass obliquely

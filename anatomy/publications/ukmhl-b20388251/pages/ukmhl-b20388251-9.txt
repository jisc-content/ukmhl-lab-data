This Introduction is inserted in deference to the opinions of persons very competent to judge, and who believe that some such addition is necessary to the completion of Gray's ' Anatomy.' It is not intended, however, to supersede or to trench upon the Treatises on Physiology, nor to go minutely into the more recondite and more dubious parts of microscopic research. Nor, again, is it intended to give any account in this work of vital phenomena. Such phenomena are purely within the domain of the physiologist. Consequently all the ingenious and beautiful researches by which modern microscopists (as Strieker, Yon Eecklingshausen, Beale, and others) have attempted to investigate the living tissues, lie beyond the scope of such a treatise as this. The humble aim of the following pages is to provide the Student—in the smallest compass, and in the simplest language,— with a plain account of things for the most part universally admitted, and which, with moderate pains, he can succeed in demonstrating for

OF THE BONES. the condyles of the occipital hone, and then in its basilar portion, in the squamous portion of the temporal bone, in the parietal bone, and in the vomer, in all which bones it commences about the middle of the seventh week. In the course of the same week it also commences in the orbitar wing of the sphenoid bone, and at the end in the metatarsal bones, the phalanges of the toes and the second phalanges of the fingers. In the six 'following days it commences in the body of the sphenoid bone, in those of the first .sacral vertebrae, and in the ring of the tympanum. About thp middle of the third month it shows itself in the costiform appen- dage of the seventh vertebra, before the end of the third month, in the labyrinth, and towards the end of the same month, in the ischium and inner pterygoid process ; towards the middle of the fourth month, in the ossicula tympani; at mid term, in the pubis, the calcaneum, the second phalanges of the toes, the lateral masses of the ethmoid bone and the turbinated bones of the nose ; a little later in the first pieces of the sternum ; towards the sixth month, in the body and odontoid process of the second vertebra, and in the la- teral and anterior masses of the first pelvic or sacral vertebra; a little later still in the astragalus; towards the seventh month in the sphenoidal turbinated bone ; at a later period, in the median ridge of the ethmoid bone, towards the period of birth, in theos cuboides, the first vertebra of the coccyx and the anterior arch of the atlas ; a year after, in the coracoid bone, the os magnum and os unciforme of the carpus, and in the first cuneiform bone ; about the third year in the patella and pyramidal bone; about the fourth year, in the third and second cuneiform bones ; about the fifth year, in the os scaphoides of the tarsus, the trapezium and os lunare ; towards the eighth year, in the scaphoid bone of the carpus ; a year after, in the os trapezoides, and lastly, about the twelfth year, in the os pisiforme. 591. Ossification does not everywhere result from the transfor- mation of cartilage into bone. The diaphysis of the long bones and the centre of the broad bones, which are developed at a very early period, pass immediately from the mucous to the osseous state. The other parts of the system are at first cartilaginous, and it is in them that the successive phenomena of ossification may be best observed. The cartilage, which for a longer or shorter period takes the place, and performs the functions of the bone of which it has the form and of which it gradually acquires the volume, is at first hollowed with irregular cavities, then with canals lined by vascular membranes filled with a mucilaginous or viscous fluid; it becomes opaque, its canals become red, and ossification commences towards its centre. The first point of ossification, punctum ossificationis, always appears in the substance of the cartilage, and never at its surface, It is surrounded by red cartilage at the place which is in contact with it, opaque and full of canals at a little distance from it, and at a still greater distance homogeneous and without vessels, but only

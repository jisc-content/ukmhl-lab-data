OF ANIMALS. . '25 sels or spongy canals folded upon themselves, immersed in the mass of the body, and terminating in the intestine or elsewhere, accor- ding to the use to which their product is applied. The sexes are separated. The genital organs terminate in the anus. These animals copulate only once in the course of their life. The fecun- dated female deposits her eggs in a suitable place. The egg pro- ; duces a vermiform animal, to which the name of larva is given; the I larva changes into a chrysalis, which is in a state of apparent i death; from the chrysalis issues the perfect insect, which immedi- ately reproduces and dies. These great changes of external form, accompanied with other somewhat less remarkable changes in the structure, are called metamorphoses. All insects, excepting the Thysanouri and Parasites, which by their resemblance to the mites, approach to the arachnides, undergo these metamorphoses, al- though some do not go through them all. The organs of motion are muscles and the skin hardened by a horny matter which it con- tains in its substance. There are six articulated feet, four wings in the greater number, only two in some, while a few only are des- titute of wings. The motions are very diversified, consisting of walking, running, leaping, and flying. The organs of sensation are compound eyes, and in several smooth eyes, commonly to the number of three, antennae and palpi. They possess the senses of smell and hearing, but the organs are not known. The nervous system has the disposition described in ยง 28, and terminates an- teriorly by a small ganglion or brain, situated upon the oesophagus, and which supplies the eyes and other parts of the head. โข42. The Arachnides or octopodal articulate animals, whose head, which is destitute of antenna?, is confounded with the thorax, have eight feet and no wings. The alimentary canal commences in some by a mouth with two lateral mandibles, in others by a mouth having the form of a sucker. Most of these animals have palpi. They are subject to sheddings of the skin, but do not undergo me- tamorphoses. The sexes are separated, and their mode of genera- tion is oviparoiis. Most of them have visible eyes, which vary as to number and situation. They present two degrees of organization. The first or most simple is that of tracheal arteries, in which there are no organs of circulation more apparent than in insects, and the organs of respi- ration are branched tracheae distinct from each other. The most compound is that of the pulmonary or branchial arteries, (spiders, tarantula?, scorpions.) They have a simple muscular heart, placed in the dorsal region, elongated, cylindrical, branchial or pulmonary, whence issue vessels for the respiratory organs, which are pulmon- ary sacs, and from thence for the whole body. There is also a liver composed of grains or lobules collected into clusters. The sexual organs are double in each sex. Some of them copulate se- veral times and live several years. The scorpions arc ovoviviparous. 43. The myriapoda or centipedes form a small group of animals intermediate between the Crustacea, which they resemble in their

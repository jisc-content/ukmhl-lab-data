When the half of the circumference of the artery at ^ 'lf I i is cut, the hemorrhage, if left to itself, continues, or is renewed after 1 being stopped, until death.

When a middle-sized artery is cut across, whether upon tact, which was cup- I; an amputated surface, or in the continuity of the parts, the blood h) M.

In the latter case, which is of very !cr. in the place where I rare occurrence in the human species, the artery being retracted i! ncarlv pa- ■ = into its sheath and into the surrounding cellular tissue, the blood infiltrates and coagulates round the end of the vessel. It also i coagulates in the mouth of the vessel itself, to a greater or less height, always determined by the situation of the nearest branch , U\ Kill" "'-V f icU exists between tne '.''thewallsoi'■ :ul 'which the circulation continues to take place. The end of the red w' I artery is then obstructed and stopped, much the same way as the it neck of a bottle is by the cork and the wax with which it is covered. ' The artery being no longer submitted to the alternate distention which it underwent, gradually returns upon itself; its truncated "|!1S1 j^j I ■ extremity undergoes traumatic inflammation, and becomes the seat i|' of a plastic exudation ; the end cicatrizes, the blood coagulates at the interior, and as the exterior is gradually absorbed, the artery ^ jj I' continues to contract, changes into an impermeable cord, and at lU{thf^'f length disappears, oris converted into cellular tissue up to the neighbourhood of the nearest branch which continues to carry on the circulation. 429- When an artery is distended in the longitudinal direction, it at first elongates greatly by sliding in its sheath, which the sur- rounding cellular tissue permits it to do.

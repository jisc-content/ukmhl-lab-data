399 APPENDIX. sufficient to break, but not destroy the vitality of the bone, it is proba- ble that compound fractures unite much in the same manner as simple ones. For as bones are slow in going through the various processes from health to disease, so the lacerated soft parts may suppurate and heal by granulations, whilst the bone will unite chiefly by what must be considered the first intention. The manner in which the new bone acquires a periosteum, is still a subject of much interest. In the examination of a very few specimens, I have observed a thin membrane covering the new osseous granula- tions ; but I know of no facts to decide whence this membrane proceeds. It is not unlikely that it is supplied by the cellular texture either of the new bone, or of the surrounding- parts; and that in some instances it may be merely a prolongation of the old. New skin on ulcers does not always grow from the surrounding healthy edges; which fact may be applied to the formation of new periosteum. FINIS. EDINBURGH : PRINTED BY A. BALI OUR AND CO. NIDDRY

xix LIFE OF BECLAltD. which Meckel's General Anatomy teems. On the other hand, Beclard's work has been compared with Bichat's, the enchanting style of which is incessantly praised; but is it not known that Bichat wrote at a period when it was requisite to draw the readers along, by the charm of diction, while Beclard wrote for men whom science her- self enticed without the aid of any artifice.

He was pos- sessed of an imperturbable coolness, a firmness which ne- ver degenerated into harshness, and an address which was the fruit of long and numerous dissections. Unfore- seen circumstances often render it necessary to deviate from the rules of art, and Beclard knew, on occasion, to modify the methods in use, or to invent others. As his coolness never abandoned him, his memory often re- called, or his genius suggested to him, in the course of an operation, all that he required to render its execution complete.

He modified the manner of cutting the soft parts in amputa- tion of the limb, and of sawing the tibia in amputation of the leg j he was the first who completely extirpated

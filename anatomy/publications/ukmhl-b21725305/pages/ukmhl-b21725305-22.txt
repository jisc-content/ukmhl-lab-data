XVL LIFE OF BECLAKD. judgment placed him above a great number of pupils whose dexterity was limited to discovering a muscle or pursuing the ramifications of an artery. Possessed of the faculties of dissecting well, seeing acuratelyand retaining with correctness the disposition of the parts, he had in him all the qualities of a good anatomist. When he went to Paris, anatomy and physiology, already improved by the labours of Haller, Bordeu, and Bichat, and adorned with all the lustre of their genius, were the favourite ob- jects of study to the greater part of the students, who were attracted to them by the new discoveries as well as by the prospect of the numerous applications which might be made of them to medicine and surgery. Our author cultivated these sciences with an ardour which was sustained by the example of Portal, Chaussier and Dumeril. Pinel had already, from anatomical considera- tions, established important distinctions for the art of healing; and the school of which he was the leader fol- lowed with a truly remarkable enthusiasm the impulse given that philosophical physician. The indispensable union of the study of the organization and that of diseases was already cemented; and it was with the object of rendering it still more necessary that Bayle, Laennec, Richerand and Duyputren, made us better acquainted with the action of our organs in the state of health, and the different kinds of alterations which they may undergo. It will readily be conceived that Beclard entered into the spirit of the times with so much the more ardour that he was capable of foreseeing all the good that might re- sult from it. He did not therefore limit himself to the bare and dry study of anatomy, but always viewed it in its relations to medicine and surgery. He devoted his whole time to the study of the relation of the parts to each other, and of the variations of form and direction which certain circumstances may force them to undergo ; and as he did not find in the prodigious number of facts which

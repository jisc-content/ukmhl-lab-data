PREFACE. VI concerning the system of organs under consideration. M. Lauth's History of Anatomy, of which as yet there is only one volume published, has aided me in giving se- veral of these historical notices. The first section of the introduction treats of the organi- zation in general, the second of the human body. In the former, my object was to give the reader a general idea of Comparative Anatomy and Comparative Physiology. Not that it had been my intention, thereby, to exempt students from the study of the anatomy of the lower ani- mals, but, rather to demonstrate the utility of such. In the composition of this part of the introduction, I have availed myself of the labours of M.M. Dumeril, Blain- ville, Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, Lamark, and especially M. Cuvier, who might be quoted in every page. In the latter section, I have given general observations on the human body ; spoken of its humours in general, a branch of the science of organization by far too much neglected since the labours of Haller and his school, who erroneous- ly expected to find, in the nervous system, and in the phenomena of irritability and of sensibility, the whole secret of vitality. Since anatomy is not to the physician a matter of barren curiosity, and mere speculation, but the foundation of all his knowledge in reference to medicine, I have thought that physiology and pathology ought not absolutely to be disjoined from it. I am fully persuaded, that patho- logical and common anatomy should be combined ; there- fore, the description of each tissue is completed by a sketch of the varieties and changes observed in it, and the whole work, by a chapter on the accidental productions common to several organs, or to'all.

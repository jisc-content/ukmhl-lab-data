INTRODUCTION. 1. Anatomy has for its object the investigation of organized bodies. It is the science which treats of organization, and all sub- stances possessed of organic structure belong to it. Man, the most complex of all animals, is the principal subject of this science. The knowledge of the human body, of the various parts of which it is composed, and of the mutual arrangement of these parts, is in fact the essential end of anatomy. Comparative Anatomy, which might with equal propriety be named General Anatomy, embraces within its domain all organized bodies. It seeks to discover, by comparison, what they possess in common, and in what they differ from each other. Phytotomy is the general anatomy of vegetables ; that of animals bears the name of Zootomy. Anatomy is also general, when it has for its subject, a class, a genus, or a group of organized beings, as that of the do- mestic animals, or veterinary anatomy. Particular Anatomy, on the other hand, has for its subject a single species of organized bodies. Such is the anatomy of the elephant, of the horse, of man, &c. In human anatomy, the term general anatomy has a different acceptation, which will be pointed out as we proceed; but we must first endeavour to acquire a correct idea of organization in general, and of the bodies which are possessed of it. SECTION FIRST. OF ORGANIZED BODIES. 2. Bodies, which are capable of extension and possessed of mo- bility, form the subject of a science, immense in its extent, and which is called natural science, natural philosophy, or physics; but they may be considered in two different points of view, in the state of rest, or in the state of motion or of action. In the first of these two modes of viewing objects, it is the form, whether external B

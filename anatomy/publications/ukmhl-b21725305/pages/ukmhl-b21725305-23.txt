XVII LIFE OF BKCLAUD. passed under his eyes means sufficiently great to multi- ply his acquirements, he was seen, in his eager pursuit of knowledge, to extend to the utmost the limits of his erudition. Full of admiration for the German school, to which we are indebted for so many valuable discoveries in the science of the organization, he at an early period made himself familiar with the labours of Meckel, Oken, Tiede- mann, &c. He, in like manner, laid under contribution the discoveries of the celebrated anatomists of England and Italy; and it was when he had become possessed of amass of facts collected, so to speak, from all parts of the world, that he took upon himself the task of sub- mitting to the crucible of his severe judgment and vast experience, all the facts, opinions, and theories which had been denounced or agitated. Some persons, envious of his glory, accused him of being nothing but a compiler, a mere man of reading, and re- fused to this remarkable man the least spark of genius. They forgot that in following such a course, and in ac- complishing a task so difficult, Beclard required to give proof, at each step, of a quick and accurate apprehen- sion, an uncommon talent for instruction, and a truly su- perior logic. The parallel that has been attempted to be drawn between Bichat and Beclard cannot really ex- ist. If these two men resemble each other in their ra- pidly acquired reputation and their premature end, they differ essentially in the spirit with which they cultivated the science which they have equally improved. Rich in his own foundations, and led on by the desire of con- structing an edifice of a new form, Bichat hastened to reduce to order materials which he owed in a great mea- sure to his own unaided labours. Beclard, on the con- trary, formed the vast project of collecting the facts that were scattered in the domain of science, with the view of forming them into a body of doctrine which should present for its authenticity the authority of the most ce- lebrated names, and the fruit of the investigation of the 6

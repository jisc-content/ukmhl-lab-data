ADVERTISEMENT. IV of M. JBecIard, which seemed to me to contain all that the Student could possibly desire, as an elementary work. The introduction, which treats of matters with which M. Beclard was not familiar, and of which, indeed, he was almost entirely ignorant, might, with great propriety, have been omitted j but I felt that so great liberty could not be taken with the first edition of the work. R. K. Edinburgh, Nkwington Place, Dec. 15, 1829.

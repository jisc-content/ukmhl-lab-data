OF THE EXTERNAL ML'SCLKS. 3l<2. deep, &c. has been employed as a means of distinction. They have also been designated by the name of the part which they moye, or of the region which they occupy, as the palpebral, occular, labial, pectoral, dorsal, abdominal muscles, &c. Others are dis- tinguished, with reference to their extent or volume, by the epi- thets magnus, parvus, medius, gracilis, vastus, latus, longus, brevis, <ยง-e. Others have been named rhomboideus, quadratus, triangularis, scalenus, Szc, according to the figure to which they are likened ; splenitis, from a comparison with the spleen or a com- press ; solearis, on account of a resemblance to a sole or flounder. Certain muscles have been named, from their direction, recti, ob- liqui, transversi. From their texture and composition, they have been named biceps, triceps, complexus, semi-tendinosus, perforans, perforatus, fyc. Other muscles have been named from their inser- tions, whether from one of them, as the pterygoidei, peronci, %ygo~ matici, fyc. ; or from two, as the stylo-hyoideus, sterno-hyoideus; or from a greater number, as the sterno-cleido-mastoideus. Others have been named, from their uses, Jlexores, extensores, levatores, depressores, pronatores, supinatores, 8fc. Other circumstances also have been taken into consideration in naming the muscles. Scarcely any of these considerations is altogether useless with re- spect to the knowledge of the functions of the muscles. At the same time, the most useful, without doubt, are the motion itself, the attachments, the region occupied by the muscles, its direction, &c. However numerous these bases may be, it would not matter much, did they always furnish proper names which should be dis- tinct and short, even although they might not be very significant ; but almost all the names of the muscles are names compounded of several of the circumstances indicated. Thus in the nomenclature of the muscles we find the names : obliquus externus abdominis, rectus anticus capitis longus, radialis, externus primus, rectus femoris anticus, interosseus dorsalis manus primus, Sfc. This inconvenience, joined to that which results from the multiplicity of different names given by different anatomists to the same muscle, have induced M. Chaussier* to propose a reform in the language of anatomy, and especially in that of myology. This reform in the names of the muscles consists in giving to each of them a name which expresses only and invariably the two opposite points of at- tachment, commonly designated by the names of origin and inser- tion. But it has been found impossible by the excellent author of this project to give names which were not at the same time, in con- siderable number at least, compounded of some other of the cir- cumstances indicated above. M. Dumasf has attempted to modify M. Chaussier's nomenclature, by indicating in his nomenclature all โข Exposition tommalre des muscles du corps humain. Pijon, 1789. Tableau des Muscles a\c VHomme.

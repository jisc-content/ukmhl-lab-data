OF THE VASCULAR SYSTEM. 16S I the surface of that membrane by the orifice of the follicles, have bbeen deflected by the accidental enlargement of that cavity. 3-15. These alterations of the hairs,* like that of the nails, have sail their origin and cause in the productive parts, and the produced cor horny part experiences the effects of this cause. When a hair i is pulled out, or when it falls off in consequence of some affection l of the skin, and the latter happens to cease, it shoots up again and . grows by the same organic process as the nails. This regenera- ; tion is effected in the same manner as the original production, | (ยง 34<3.) When the hairs become white through the effects of I age or other causes, it is at the free extremity that the whitening i commences. It is in the same manner that the autumnal change t to white which is observed in many animals is effected, and this (circumstance seems to indicate, that the interior of the hair is the : seat of a kind of imbibition, the matter of which is furnished by i the papilla of the bulb or follicle. This would also seem to be i indicated by the circumstance, that after severe fevers, and in imany chronic diseases, the hairs of the head, when they do not i fall off, undergo a kind of diminution or atrophy; they become (transparent, dry, and brittle, and when health is restored, resume t their original qualities. The hair of the head has also been seen, I after experiencing albinism,, or without having been previously i whitened, to change colour and become black. The morbid phe- i nomenon of the plica polonica, in which the hair is said to become isoft and fleshy, and to bleed when cut close to the skin, forms no (exception to the general proposition, that the stem only of the lhair can participate in the healthy or morbid state of the skin. It may, in fact, easily be conceded, that the papilla of the hair, i if it is inflamed, may rise contained within the root of the hair to (the level of the skin, and that its vascular tissue may be wounded iin shaving the stem of the hair, but there is probably much ex- aggeration in what is related of the plica. CHAPTER IV. OF THE VASCULAR SYSTEM. 346. The Vascular System (Systerna Vasorum) consists of a i multitude of ramified canals, communicating with each other, and i in which the nutritive humours incessantly traverse the whole ex- e' (tent of the body ; receiving at the tegumentary surfaces the matters derived by absorption from without, and there giving off those fur- nished by excretory secretion ; alternately depositing and taking up molecules in the closed cavities of the cellular tissue; continually i: โข Plenck, Be MorUs Capillorum, in Op.

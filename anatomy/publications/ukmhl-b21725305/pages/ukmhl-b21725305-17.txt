xi LIFE OF 15ECLAUU. Bichat before our young student could hear his lectures, for it was not until 1808 that he removed to Paris; but he had already collected with avidity notes taken at the last course of that celebrated anatomist. In 1808, Beclard was received as a pupil of the first rank in the Ecole Pratique and hospitals of Paris. In 1809, he obtained at the school of medicine prizes in anatomy, physiology, medical natural history, chemistry, and physics. Nor was it long .before he was admited as an eleve interne to the hospitals. In 1810, he again car- ried off prizes in anatomy, physiology, medicine and sur- gery, and M. Roux entrusted him with the honourable charge of preparing and repeating his lectures, at the Hospital de la Charite. Hitherto Beclard was known only to his rivals and friends, and all his merit only shone in his vast memory and the facility of his expression. His genius had not yet assumed a determinate character, nor had any origin- al investigation unveiled to him his resources ; but pre- sently an opportunity of signalizing himself presented it- self. The situation of principal conductor of the school of practical anatomy of Paris was rendered vacant by the appointment of M. Dupuytren to the chair of operative surgery. Beclard, who was named prosecteur in 1811, became a candidate for the office and was successful. He had already gained the esteem of numerous pupils who had attended his private courses. His reputation as an anatomist had scarcely begun ; but the moment the new chief dissector found himself surrounded by so many means of instruction, he hastened to profit by them. He had besides, in his inauguratory thesis, pointed out in the most luminous manner what course a person entrusted with this office ought to follow in the discharge of his im- portant functions. There was, therefore, a right to ex- pect that, faithful to the principles which he had traced, he should not be wanting in reducing them to practice.

XLV LIFE OF 15ECLAUD. taught him the mode of operating at the Rcole de Per fee- tionnementy and Beclard was presently seen to possess surgical talents of the highest order, for the exercise of which he was peculiarly fitted by his natural adroitness and his great skill as a dissector. In 1816, he became a member of the Philomathic So- ciety, and for the first time delivered a course of general anatomy. In 1817, his inquiries respecting the wounds of arteries made their appearance. The experiments of Jones in England were hardly known, when our anato- mist thought it would be important to verify them, and the result of his investigation confirmed the inferences of the English experimenter. Beclard's Memoir occurs among those of the Medical Society of Emulation, of which he was a member. In 1818, he published with M. J. Cloquet a translation of Lawrence's Treatise on Hernia. It was in this year also that the medical faculty of Paris received him as a member. This memorable cir- cumstance jÂ©f Beclard's life, by adding a new lustre to his reputation, inspired him with the desire of equalling the celebrated professors of that faculty, old in renown and experience. Accordingly, he was seen to redouble his efforts to discharge in a becoming manner the func- tions which had been entrusted to him. The keenness with which the students heard his learned lectures on anatomy justified the choice which the school had made of this remarkable man. He contributed to the formation of a scientific collec- tion then known under the title of Nouveau Journal de Medeci?ie, of which the Archives Generates de Medecine are now the continuation. In 1819, he published four memoirs on osteosis, in which he exposed its progress with the greatest precision and in the most luminous manner. He co-operated in the compilation of the Dic- tionnaire des Termes de Medecine, Chirurgie, Phanna- cie, &c. and was one of the principal editors of the Nou- veau Dictionnaire de Medecine.

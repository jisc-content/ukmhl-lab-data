OF THE CELLULAR TISSUE. 71 GENERAL ANATOMY CHAPTER FIRST. OF THE CELLULAR AND ADIPOSE TISSUES. 133. These two tissues are generally confounded under the name of cellular tissue. They differ, however, from each other, and require to be separately described. SECTION FIRST. OF THE CELLULAR TISSUE. 134. The cellular tissue has been so named on account of the areolae which it forms, and which, perhaps inappropriately, have been called cellules. It is a soft spongy tissue, generally diffused through the body, which surrounds all the organs, connects them together, and at the same time separates them from each other, penetrates into their substance and exhibits similar appearances in all their parts, and which, entering into the composition of all or- ganized bodies, and of all their organs, is the principal element of the organization. According to the manner in which it has been viewed, it has re- ceived various names, such as cribrous, mucous, glutinous, inter- mediate, areolar, reticulated, laminar or filamentous substance, body, system, organ, membrane or tissue. Perhaps the name of cellular tissue is not the best that might be applied to it, but as it is in general use we shall adopt it. 135. Notwithstanding the great extent and importance of this tissue, which must have struck the earliest anatomists, we find no description of it in the works of the ancients. Hippocrates speaks of the general permeability of the tissues, when he says that the whole body is obviously perspirable both externally and internally. The first idea of the cellular tissue has been supposed to present itself in this passage. What Erasistratus calls, the parenchyma perhaps corresponds to this tissue. But we must come down to Charles Eticnne, Vesalius and Adrian Spigel, before we meet with any accurate notions respecting the disposition of the cellular tis- sue ; and even they, ay well as many of the anatomists who sue-

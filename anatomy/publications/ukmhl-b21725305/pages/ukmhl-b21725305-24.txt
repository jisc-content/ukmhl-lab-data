XVlll LIFE OF BECLARD. most estimable observers. To the glory of being an ori- ginal writer and a discoverer, Beclard preferred the me- rit of giving lustre to truth, from whatever source it might emanate. He was, without doubt, one of the greatest admirers of Bichat, and if he often combated his ideas, it was because he considered it his duty to do so for the interest of science. I believe the distinction that was made between Bos- suet and Massillon may be applied to Bichat and Beclard. The Bishop of Meaux preached one day before an il- lustrious audience. Massillon on hearing him, said; " he does well, I admire him ; but if I were in his place, I would do otherwise." Such was Beclard, with reference to Bichat. Colder, and less enthusiastic, he came after him to correct the errors that had escaped the inventive genius of that great man. Let us then cease to establish between them a comparison which does not permit the one and the other to be judged, according to his proper merit. They must be viewed separately ; it is in their individual and peculiar talent that they are to be ad- mired. It was in consequence of this plan of reform and im- provement that Beclard first published a new edition of Bichat's General Anatomy, with a volume of additions ; and it was with the same object that he afterwards pub- lished his own General Anatomy, a work remarkable for its clearness, the great number of facts which it contains, the extensive scale on which it has been constructed, and the vast erudition displayed in it. This work has been compared with Meckel's Manual of Descriptive and Pathological General Anatomy. It is true, that the French anatomist has sometimes extracted more or less interesting facts from that great collection ; but how much has the imitator surpassed his model, with what art has he avoided those German ideas, those hypothe- tical explanations, and those forced resemblances with

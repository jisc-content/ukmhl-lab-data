DEFECTIVE MUSCULAR ACTION. 193 region, which will especially require, a pad or pil- low, to support the muscles in the natural bend of this part. Much has been said against the use of feather beds, but if not too soft, I think that in most cases, they are preferable to mattresses, for the pliability of their surface naturally accommodates itself to the inflections of the body, and every part is equally supported and at rest. The above system of treatment is equally applica- ble to convalescents, from other spinal diseases, but the activity of the malady, whether seated in the ligaments, cartilages, or bones, must have completely subsided before we have recourse to active exercise. The time required for the cure of spinal deformi- ties of course varies. During the period of growth, perseverance will almost invariably ensure success, and if the distortion is recent, the shape will be re- stored in a few months, but the exercises must be continued afterwards to prevent a relapse. Even when the growth has ceased, if no absorption has taken place in the bones, if they have not yet been rendered cuneiform by pressure, we may sometimes succeed in removing the deformity entirely ; but it is obvious that, when the osseous system is much implicated, a complete cure cannot be effected, and some degree of deformity must remain for life. o

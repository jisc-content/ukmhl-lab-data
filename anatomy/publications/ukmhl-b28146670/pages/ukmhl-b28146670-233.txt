DISEASE OF THE FIBRO-CARTILAGES. 211 efficacious, may be directed to the spinal region. In cases which have resisted other treatment, moxas have been burnt over the seat of the disease, and are in my opinion superior in efficacy to either caustic issues, or blisters: there appears to be something peculiar in the action of fire on the skin, different from simple irritation produced by other means, and its effects are often more beneficial than other coun- ter-irritants, though it may not be easy to explain why. Tonics form an essential part of the treatment of these maladies, and the various preparations of iron are extremely beneficial. Carbonate of iron com- bined with carbonate of soda, is a useful combina- tion : alkalies being very excellent remedies in this class of diseases, as they are in all constitutional affec- tions, more or less allied to scrophula. When all symptoms of inflammation or tumefac- tion of the fibro-cartilages have disappeared, we must have recourse to exercises, upon which our great dependance must rest, not only for removing the existing, but for preventing future deformity. The modes of exercise described in the preceding chapter, are equally applicable to convalescents from disease of the fibro-cartilages. It is in the deformities re- sulting from this affection, that mechanical extension of the spine, and pressure on its curvatures, have been so successfully employed by Delpech, and other continental surgeons. p 2

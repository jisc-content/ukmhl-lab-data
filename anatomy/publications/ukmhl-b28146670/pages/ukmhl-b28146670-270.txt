248 PLATES. dorsal vertebra, the first of which was received into a kind of groove, hollowed in the body of the former. The bodies of the sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth and tenth dorsal vertebrae have almost completely dis- appeared, their confused remains form a mass cover- ed with osseous vegetations. The foramina were all preserved but deformed, and diminished in size.— The spinous processes corresponding to the lost vertebrae, had undergone a remarkable deviation, in- stead of projecting more than usual, they were much inclined and even slightly curved, so as entirely to fill up the interval which separated the eighth from the ninth, and the ninth from the tenth dorsal verte- brae, and to complete posteriorly the medullary canal. The manner in which Nature had preserved the spinal canal in the midst of such devastation is remarkable. The vertebral column being sawed lengthwise we see (Fig. 2) with what apparent art the canal has been protected. ERRATA.

DEFECTIVE MUSCULAR ACTION. 180 curvature. The means used for this purpose, are of less importance than prudence and care, in their management. I prefer making extension with the patient in the horizontal position. The head and shoulders being fixed by proper pads and bandages to the head of the bed or sofa, extension is made by a screw or a pully at the foot, communicating with straps attached to the sides of a bandage which sur- rounds the pelvis. Having by a careful examination determined that the curvature is unconnected with disease of the cartilages, or the bones, we must ascertain how far the vertebral column can be res- tored by extension. If we find that the curvatures may be even par- tially removed by extension, our prognosis will of course be favourable. If there is no complete an- chylosis, if the ribs are not greatly altered in shape, we may confidently expect to palliate the deformity, to improve, at least, if not to restore, the shape to its natural proportions. What may be effected by perseverance, even in inveterate cases, is truly as- tonishing, but it is only by rigid adherence to rules, and faithful attention to them, on the part of the patient, that we can hope for success in such cases. The earlier an attempt is made to cure deformity the better, but there are few curvatures, originating in muscular derangements, which cannot be entirely effaced before the growth has ceased, and many

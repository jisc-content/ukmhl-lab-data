156 OF CURVATURE FORWARDS. of the vertebrae. If the curvature has been formed during the period of growth, the compressed and distorted vertebrae, do not increase in size in a rela- tive proportion with the rest of the column, and the calibre of the canal will be contracted at the part where the disease is seated, but its internal surface almost invariably remains smooth and continuous. When the arch formed by the curvature is small, the spinous processes are much separated, and the medullary cord is more exposed than usual, but these processes becoming ossified, an additional pro- tection is formed for this part. The foramina for the passage of the nerves, arc often considerably thrown out of their natural directions, and diminish- ed in size, but never obliterated. We should natu- rally expect some disturbance in those parts, the nerves of which communicate with the tortuous portion of the spinal marrow, but the nervous symp- toms do not in all instances bear a relation to the extent of curvature. Some patients with a small degree of distortion will be affected with paralysis of the lower limbs, general weakness, and torpor of the digestive and urinary organs, while others with very considerable curvature, from destruction of the bodies of several vertebrae, shall be able to walk to a very late period of their existence. (See plate 4.) Although an interruption of the continuity of the medullary cord in curvatures of the spine, is not a frequent occurrence, some few instances of destruc-

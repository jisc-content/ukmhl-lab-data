223 DISEASE OF THE BONES. rous dissections, detected tubercles in different stages of their progress ; and he proposes to name the malady, the tubercular affection of the vertebrae. These tubercles are sometimes developed in the interior, and sometimes on the surface of the verte- brae. In the first case, no change occurs in the form of the spine, until the morbid structure, having hol- lowed by its development the body of the bone, forms a cavity, the walls of which become too thin to support the weight of the upper portion of the body; these walls give way, and the upper part of the ver- tebral column, falls forwards towards the lower, forming an angle at the diseased part. In the second case the destruction operates from before backwards, or in any other direction, and the deformity occurs at a later period: in fact, not until the bodies of the diseased vertebrie, are reduced to a thin shell, on the opposite point to that where the malady began. Generally speaking the curve is forwards, but if the destruction of the bone occurs towards one side, we shall also have some degree of lateral curvature, a complication which is not uncommon. As the malady proceeds the periosteum becomes inflamed, and in favourable circumstances furnishes materials of a new organization, by the deposition of ossific matter, which cements the two ends of the spinal division, and re-establishes the continuity of the two halves of the vertebral column. It is obvious, that a most essential condition, towards

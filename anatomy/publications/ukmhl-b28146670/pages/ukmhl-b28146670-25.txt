GROWTH OF BONE. .*1 b 2 stance, where it is less so. Soft bones, having more animal matter, are more vascular than harder bones. The bones of young growing animals, possessing more vessels than those of full grown animals, are therefore softer. The strength, thickness, and muscular impressions of bones, differ in skeletons of the same height. In women, and men of inactive lives, the bones have a less degree of these qualities, than those whose lives have been active and laborious. The phenomena of the formation and growth of the antlers of the stag kind, are perfectly analogous to ossification in the bodies of animals, for the antler is a true bone. The bones from the frame-work of the animal system, support and defend the more important organs. They offer most resistance to external in- fluences, remaining unchanged for ages : their im- perishable nature bearing records even of the an- tediluvian world. The form of the future bone, is represented in the foetus by cartilage, the vessels of which gradually enlarge until they are capable of carrying the red globules of the blood, when ossification begins. The arteries increase, and form a complete network, at the centre of ossification, from which fibres pro- ceed, according to the intended form of the bone. 1 he bone is first red, but as the earthy matter in- ci eases, the number of vessels diminish, the centre

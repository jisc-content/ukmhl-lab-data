105 TREATMENT OF VARUS. distortion. It is comparatively very rare, and as the only difference in the treatment between this and varus, consists in reversing the action ot the springs, used in the restoration of the foot, it is unnecessary to dwell longer on this subject. Treatment of Varus. In early infancy, the foot may be easily restored to its proper direction: the ligaments then preserve all their suppleness ; but as the child advances in age, the retracted ligaments become more rigid, the shortened muscles yield less to elongation, and the restoration of the foot cannot be completely effected ; at a more advanced stage, anchylosis takes place among the tarsal bones, it is no longer possible to alter the direction of the foot, and all machinery is unavailing. We cannot commence the treatment of this dis- tortion too early ; at birth very simple means only are required to restore the foot, and this may in all jjases be effected, before the period arrives when the child should walk. Anchylosis is the only real ob- stacle to the cure ol these distortions, and this does not take place generally, before the period of growth has ceased ; but the bones become accommodated to their new positions, and it is difficult to effect a change in their position after the age of ten or twelve. 1 he atrophy of the muscles may render the treatment longer, but it is never an insuperable difficulty, for the muscles invariably begin to ac-

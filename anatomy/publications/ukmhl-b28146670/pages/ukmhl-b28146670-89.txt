WRIST AND FINGERS. 67 fingers will be sometimes consolidated, and the hand of a fin-like shape, similar to the anterior extremity of the seal. Sometimes the bones are united, but most frequently the connexion is membranous. In these latter cases the fingers must be separated, and motion perseveringly employed, while the wounds are healing, to restore their use; without great at- tention to this circumstance, but little benefit will be derived from the operation. Although operations for the removal of the con- tractions of cicatrices after burns, are often unsuc- cessful, cases are frequently met with, which justify the attempt, because without it, the limb must re- main useless for life. Mr. Earle, in a paper in the 7th volume of the Medico-Chirurgical Transactions, has related some cases of successful removal of con- tractions among the fingers, and between the arm and fore-arm. His mode of treating such cases? consists in dissecting away every part of the con- tracted cicatrix, and gradually extending the limb by means of a splint, which must be continued not only during the healing of the wound, but for some time afterwards. Mr. Earleâ€™s operation has also been successful in the hands of other surgeons, not only in contractions about the arms, but in those about the neck ; and when, from neglect in keeping the limbs in a proper position, during the healing of burns and scalds, such contractions have taken place, the sooner the operation is resorted to, the better.

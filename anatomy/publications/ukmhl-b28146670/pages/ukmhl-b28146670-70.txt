Children born healthy, and who would have continued so under proper management, exhibit slight derangements, attributed to flatulence, acidity, &c. which are removed by medicine ; an improper system of diet is continued, new and ag- gravated attacks occur, requiring more medical treat- ment, until a state of constitution is engendered, in- capable of resisting the common complaints of child- hood. Thus it is, that the bills of mortality are fed with so many victims at an early age, from one-fourth to one-fifth of the children born in this metropolis, dying before the age of two years. We accuse the changeability of our climate, but the fault does not lie there, but in that debility of constitution pro- duced by mismanagement, which renders children incapable of resisting the influence of cold, and other external agents.

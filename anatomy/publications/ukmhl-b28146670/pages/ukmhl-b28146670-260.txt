238 ON THE MECHANICAL APPARATUS means. In France there are establishments called “ Maison’s Orthopediques,” for the cure of deformi- ties, and it seems to be an object with the proprietors of these houses to surpass each other in the invention of the most complex machinery. They not only stretch the spine, but apply mechanical means to act on the lateral contortions and inflections of the co- lumn. It is the practice in these institutions to keep up extension during the night as well as the day, and the patients sleep on beds to which they are fixed by the extending apparatus. In the wood-cut be- low, is seen a figure undergoing this process, which is effected by machinery concealed in the frame of the bed. The extension is rendered elastic by means of springs. The lateral bracings are intended to operate on the respective curves or twists of the spine.

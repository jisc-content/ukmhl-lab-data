OF THE HIP-JOINT. 75 This structure very much impedes the motions ot the limb, more especially those of abduction and rotation, and engenders many difficulties, in station, and locomotion. In individuals thus deformed, there is a striking disproportion, between the upper parts of the body, and the inferior extremities ; the trunk is fully developed, while the lower limbs are short and thin, as if they had belonged to a person of smaller stature. The shortness, and leanness, of these members, are rendered more striking by the size of the pelvis, the development of which, does not suffer from what occurs at its exterior. With respect to attitude, the upper part of the trunk is carried very backward: the lumbar region of the spine is unusually forward, producing a great hollow in this part of the back: the pelvis is situated almost horizontally on the thigh-bones: the point of the foot, alone touches the ground: all these circumstances evidently result, from the transposition of the ileo-femoral articulation, by which the centre of motion, is carried to a point of the pelvis more backward than natural. When a person, having this conformation of the hip-joint, is disposed to walk, he rises on the points of his feet, inclines the upper part of the trunk towards the member, which is to support the weight of the body, elevates the opposite foot from the ground, and painfully transports his weight from one side to the other. Every time that this effort

138 GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ently well, to permit many deformed persons to en- joy a great share of health and spirits, and often to distinguish themselves by great mental efforts. We may form an opinion of those cases of dis- torted spine, which are susceptible of cure, by gent- ly raising the body by the chin and nape of the neck, or by extension in the horizontal position, which is the best mode ; if the curves are in part effaced, it is enough to shew, that the vertebrae have not been rendered immoveable, and we may conse- quently give a favourable opinion of the result. It does not follow that very bad cases are the most difficult of cure, for where there is great, but in- creasing deformity, we have more reason to expect success in our treatment, than when a smaller de- gree has been long in a fixed state. In distortion from caries, the most happy result will be anchylosis of the remaining portions of the bodies of the diseased vertebrae. The necessity of a correct diagnosis in these cases is obvious. The same remark applies to spinal deviations in conse- quence of rickets ; when the disease has terminat- ed, and the bones have recovered their density, any change in form is almost, if not altogether, hope- less. These general observations sufficiently establish the necessity of a careful diagnosis, in cases of spinal distortion, seeing that they are the effects of very different causes. For the sake of perspicuity, I shall

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON DEFORMITIES. 31 sily divided, than when the operation is performed in consequence of sudden accident. Muscular power is throughout life very variable, and is subject to every influence, that affects the general health of the constitution. An acute dis- ease, fever, temporary derangement of the organs of nutrition, and various other causes, often diminish, and sometimes destroy, muscular irritability. In youth more especially, while the body is growing, these causes of muscular debility are most pernicious in their operation. It is probable, that in growth, the bones take precedence of the muscles, and that the latter are, in the first instance, simply elongated by the wider separation of their points of insertion : we know that in individuals who grow rapidly, the muscular system is very weak, and that some time elapses before the latter acquires its proper degree of vigour; while in those who do not arrive at great height, and whose growth is comparatively slow, the development of the muscles, follows so quickly on that of the bones, that little or no difference, in this respect, is perceived. It is among persons whose growth has been rapid, before the muscles and ligaments could recover that density which had been diminished by extension, that we find the greater number of the subjects of distortion. It is not uncommon to find growth considerable during, or immediately after, an acute attack of dis- ease. Children, who did not previously grow with

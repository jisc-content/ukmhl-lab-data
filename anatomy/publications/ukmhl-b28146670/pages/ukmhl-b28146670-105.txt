8.3 OF THE HIP-JOINT. Delpech states that he has met with cases, where the extensor muscles of the leg were too short, and which are generally accompanied with a patella of diminutive size. These muscular defects are com- monly complicated with those which produce club- foot, but in some instances they exist alone. The muscles of the anterior part of the thigh, inserted into the patella, are not fully developed, and the motions of the leg are consequently impeded. Whether these defects exist alone, or combined with club-foot, we must use means expressly adapted for their removal, and the principle on which these remedies should be applied is the same, as in all other cases of shortened, or contracted muscles ; viz: continuous extension, which is alone capable of effecting a change in their dispositions. The measures to be adopted for this purpose must of course be varied, according to the muscle, or set of muscles, which are defective: but the defect being known, and also the principle on which it is to be treated, there will be no difficulty in the application of extending power to each individual case. It is remarkable that as we succeed in elongating the shortened muscles, we also obtain an increase in their volume, a circumstance which is very apparent in the cure of distorted feet.

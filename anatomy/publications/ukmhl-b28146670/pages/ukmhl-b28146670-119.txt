OP VARUS. 97 this is but the first step of a more considerable devi- ation, which may proceed to the total inversion ot the foot, when the internal margin looks upwards, forming an angle with the tibia. The internal ankle is almost entirely concealed, while the external pro- jects and appears lower, and more backwards than usual. The heel is drawn upwards, and inwards, towards the great toe, so that it forms the posterior extremity of a curve formed by the internal border of the foot, and when the patient stands, it does not touch the ground. The dorsum of the foot is very convex, the skin over this part being very tense: the sole is-very concave, and furrowed lengthwise. The external edge of the foot is rounded, and half circular: as the weight of the body rests on this part, the cellular tissue, and skin which covers it, become callous. The great toe is separated from the others, and abducted. It follows, from the fore- going description, that the external margin of the foot is turned downwards, the internal upwards, the sole inwards,the dorsum outwards: the tendo achillis is directed obliquely from without inwards, and is constantly tense. The muscles of the leg, and even those of the thigh, in some cases, are imperfectly developed, the calf of the leg is never formed, until the deformity is alleviated: it invariably happens, that the muscles of the leg increase in size, in pro- portion as the foot is restored to its natural position. When the deviation is slight, and confined to one H

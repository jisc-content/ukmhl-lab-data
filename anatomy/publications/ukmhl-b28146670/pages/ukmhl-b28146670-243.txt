DISEASE OF THE BONES. 221 Among the cases examined after death, where the disease had not existed long, the ligaments connect- ing the vertebras implicated in the curve, have been found thickened and relaxed, and the bodies of the bones spongy. In more advanced stages of the malady, the ligaments become still more thickened, relaxed, and altered, the bodies of the bones more soft and spongy, and inclining to become carious. The fibro-cartilages are compressed and lessened in size. In those who are destroyed by the disease, the vertebrae are found in various degrees of ulcera- tion, the intervening cartilages sometimes totally destroyed, sanies among the rotten bones, and effused on the theca of the medulla spinalis. Analogy .would lead us to expect, that here, as in the other articulations of the body, extensive caries has its origin, sometimes in an ulceration of the fibro-cartilages, and sometimes in a morbid condition of the reticulated structure of the bodies of the ver- tebra. In many dissections, the destruction of the intervertebral substances, has been found greater than that of the bones themselves; the latter having for the most part, retained their ordinary structure, and hardness, the caries being either entirely con- fined to, or most extensive on those surfaces to which the cartilages had been connected.* Ulceration of the cartilages takes place prior to * Brodie.

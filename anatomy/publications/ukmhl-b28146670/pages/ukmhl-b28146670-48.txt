OF THE MUSCLES. 2fi rests on the ground, while the other is carried for- wards in progression. The true action of the glu- teus being not solely to move the thigh on the pelvis, but also to fix the pelvis on the thigh, and to maintain it in the erect position. The breadth of the human pelvis affords a firm basis, on which all the upper parts of the body securely rest; by this means the legs are more widely separated than in other animals, which have the pelvis extremely narrow. The great muscles of the back being fixed to the pelvis, and attached above to the ribs and spinous processes of the ver- tebrae, keep the trunk erect. Those from the dorsal and cervical vertebrae, to the back part of the head, keep this in equilibrium on the spine, and thus com- plete the erect position. I shall conclude this general view of the muscular system, by a few remarks on some of the muscles of the spine. The great muscles which move the back and loins, are the quadratus lumborum, the sacro lum- balis, and longissimus dorsi. The quadratus lum- borum, so named from its square form, passes from the inferior border of the last rib to the back part of the ileum, and is connected by aponeurotic slips to the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae. The longissimus dorsi extends from the transverse processes of all the dorsal, and all the lumbar ver- tebra?, is attached to the seven or eight last ribs,

68 CONTRACTIONS OP THE WRIST AND FINGERS. Cases occasionally present themselves of gradual contraction of all the fingers : this most commonly takes place in blacksmiths, and other mechanics, whose occupation consists in the constant handling ot hard tools, the use of which require powerful contractions of the flexor muscles. The palmar fascia in these cases is much condensed and con- tracted. Instances of this affection are also met with in persons, in whom it could not have been produced by hard labour: in an instance which I met with lately, the ring-finger of the left hand gradually but slowly contracted, and was followed, in the course of a few years, by the middle and little fingers of the same hand: after some farther time the ring-finger of the other hand contracted, and the others followed in the same course : the fore-fingers are beginning to share the same fate. Upwards of twenty years have elapsed from the commencement of the malady. I am not acquainted with any means of curing this affection; in the case above alluded to several of the most eminent surgeons of this me- tropolis were consulted, but they failed in suggesting any thing that was of the slightest service!

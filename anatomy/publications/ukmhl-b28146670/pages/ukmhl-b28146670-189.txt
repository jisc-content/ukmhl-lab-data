( 1(37 ) CHAPTER IX. Of Defective Muscular Action, as a Cause of Sninal Distortions. * In a state of health, the antagonist muscles of the limbs and trunk, are reciprocally poised, and equal- ly proportioned in power. When one, or several muscles of similar action, lose their power of con- tractility, the limb is drawn by the antagonist mus- cles, out of its natural direction, and some degree of deformity ensues. In high amputation of the thigh, the flexors place the stump nearly at a right angle with the pelvis, because they have lost their con- trolling antagonists. The ligaments are not alone capable of maintaining the articulations of the bones in their perfect integrity ; a correct action of the muscles is necessary to keep all the parts of a joint in their appropriate positions. The due mainte- nance of the osseous connexions, being in part de- pendant on the muscles, a defective or irregular action of these organs, must have considerable influ- ence in the production of deformities. Muscular activity is essential to the healthy state ol the ligaments, fibro-cartilages, and bones. Want

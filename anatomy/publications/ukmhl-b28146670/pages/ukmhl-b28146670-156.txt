134 GENERAL OBSERVATIONS paces of an old horse. There is a remarkable pecu- liarity in this kind of ossification, it does not ordi- narily occur in the substance of the fibro-cartilages, but covers them in several points, or in the whole of their circumference, leaving the subjacent structure untouched : so that, when vertebrae in this state are subjected to maceration, the bones remain united by osseous plates, or bands, while a space is left between each vertebra equal to the thickness of the cartilage. Persons having the vertebral column so affected suffer more danger in falls, than others ; for not only are the bones more readily fractured, but, there being no elastic interventions, the jar is carried to the head, and may be immediately fatal. Perhaps more distortions occur about the two in- ferior dorsal, and upper lumbar vertebrae than in any other portion of the spine: the connexion of the vertebrae of the back, is firmer than in any other part of the chain : just at the base of the firmer column there will be unusual freedom of motion, and this is the cause of the frequency of distortion in this part. We may here notice some of the effects of spinal deformities on particular organs and functions. Cur- vatures forward produce only one kind of alteration in the form of the thorax : reduction of its cavity in the vertical axis of the chest. The two extremities of the spine cannot be brought nearer together, until the resistance of the sternum is overcome : it follows

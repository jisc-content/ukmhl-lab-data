28 OF THE MUSCLES. the atlas, and extending to the loins and sacrum. It moderates the lateral motion of the vertebral column, and contributes to maintain the erect position of the trunk. The sacro lumbalis, longissimus dorsi, and mul- tifidus spinae, not only support the spine, but draw the body somewhat backwards. These muscles are called into action, and greatly increased in power, in those persons who carry weights before them, sus- pended by the neck, as pedlars, &c. It has been proposed, in some spinal curvatures, to take a hint from this circumstance, and various contrivances have been made use of with this view, of which we shall have occasion to speak. Besides the muscles attached to the processes of the spine, and lying in the two channels between the vertebras and the ribs, almost all the muscles connecting the trunk and the pelvis, the pelvis and the lower extremities, have considerable effect in as- sisting many of the motions of the vertebral column. The obliquus externus abdominis has great power in the rotation of the spine, which will readily be seen by considering its attachments to the ribs and pelvis, with the direction of its fibres. The latissi- mus dorsi, when the arms are fixed, balances the body, by redressing too much curvature of the lower part of the vertebral column. When a person is in danger of falling on one side, from unexpectedly stepping off" the curb-stone, he instinctively throws

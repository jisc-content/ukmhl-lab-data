34 GENERAL OBSERVATIONS There are physiological conditions, depending on these mechanical circumstances, that are, perhaps, of more importance than the difficulty of motion induced by these alterations. The normal degree of tension of the muscles is essential to the prospe- rity of their nutrition: this function is defective, whenever their tension is augmented or diminished ; whether the extremities of a muscle be brought nearer, or separated to a greater distance than natu- ral, if their active power is destroyed, the conse- quences are the same; debility, extenuation, and degeneration. In cases of club-foot, the swelling of the calf is wanting, but no sooner is the deformity lessened, than the swelling of the muscles ot this part begins to form. In bad cases of distorted spine, the muscles are in the same state as in the legs of club-feet, small, pale, or yellow, in a languid state of nourishment, and degenerated into a kind of fatty substance. Any deviation of the spine destroys the harmony between the dimensions of the bones and muscles: some of the latter are elongated, and some shortened; their nutrition, and their power of contractility, will be both deranged, whether the extremities of the muscles have undergone an unnatural degree of se- paration, or the reverse. It follows, that if on the one hand, primary muscular weakness can, by aban- doning parts of the skeleton, to the sole density of the ligaments, lay the foundation for deformity ; so.

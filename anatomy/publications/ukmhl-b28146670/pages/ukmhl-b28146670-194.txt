172 OP SPINAL DISTORTIONS FROM formation of a new joint; structures exactly similar to capsular ligament and synovial membrane are pro- duced, but we cannot fairly infer that these new structures were effected by a mere change of cellular membrane into fibrous and serous tissue. Such changes never occur in the animal ceconomy, all new structure is the work of the arteries, which by some inherent power, alter their depositions accord- ing to the new wants of a part. Such is the case in the formation of new joints, not a change of old structure, but a secretion of new by the minute arteries. In tuberculated lungs, in cancerous breasts, in fungus haematodes, the original structure is not changed, but in the ordinary course of nutrition, the disused particles are removed by the absorbents, and the arteries, instead of depositing new particles of a similar nature, deposit those which form a morbid structure. These and all other organic diseases, are the result of some morbific action of the local arte- ries, or of the general circulation, and this leads us pretty near the old humoral pathology, which like many other old notions, may one of these days come again into fashion, and I think with some modifica- tions it will explain many of the morbid conditions of the animal oeconomy. Cancer, fungus haematodes, and the deposition of tubercles, are not always con- fined to one texture in the same subject. It is pos- sible that in these cases, there may be some erroneous mixture of the circulating fluid, (the consequence of

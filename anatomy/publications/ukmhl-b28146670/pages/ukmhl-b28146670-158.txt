GENERAL OBSERVATIONS 130 tion of the capacity of the chest, by pressing the viscera against the diaphragm, as when they en- joyed their normal degree of length. From the diminution in length of the spine, the diaphragm presses unusually on the liver, and the contents of the abdomen. The viscera often accom- modate themselves to such position, and carry on their functions much better than might be expected. But when the abdominal muscles are paralysed, or have their nervous energy impaired, from pressure or irritation of the nerves at their exit from the ca- nal, or that part of the spinal marrow with which they are connected, the functions of the abdominal viscera will be greatly deranged. Pressure of the muscles of the abdomen, seems to be essential to the well-being of the functions performed in its cavitv. J In the various forms of spinal distortions, the in- terior surface of the spinal canal is almost always, preserved smooth and continuous. When the de- formity has taken place at a very early age, the ca- libre of the affected part is somewhat contracted, but in the dissection of adults it is rare to find any diminution. The foramina deviate with the ver- tebra?, are occasionally diminished in size, but never entirely obliterated. In some cases of spinal deviation the growth of the body ceases : puberty is retarded: in males, the voice does not change, nor the beard grow.

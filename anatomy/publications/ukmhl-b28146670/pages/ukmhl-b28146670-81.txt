59 ON RICKETS. do not deposit that proportion of phosphate of lime, which is necessary to establish the compact structure of the bones. In curvatures of the spine from rickets, the bodies of the vertebrae will, in some cases, be crushed and rendered cuneiform by pressure, in others, the arti- culating processes give way, and very considerable lateral curvatures are produced, with little or no al- teration in the form of the bodies of the vertebrae. In this disease the urine has been found to con- tain much phosphate of lime, and the bones, accord- ing to Dr. Bostockâ€™s statement in the Medico-Chi- rurgical Transactions, have not yielded more than one-sixth, or one-eighth of this salt, while in their ordinary state, it bears more than the proportion of one-half, to their whole weight. The teeth generally remain hard, while the jaw in which they are fixed, has become quite soft. The late Mr. Wilson, however, mentions an instance when the bony parts of the teeth were softened. Diagnosis. There is no disease which can be confounded with rickets, but it is important to dis- tinguish curvatures of the spine, produced by this malady, from those originating in other causes. The application of mechanism, occasionally useful in some cases of spinal distortion, would obviously be improper where the bones are preternaturally soft; the pressure ol instruments on the pelvis would tend

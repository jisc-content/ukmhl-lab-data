fi OF THE FORMATION AND vessels, then ossifying spots, which running together form perfect bone. During all the process of ossi- fication, the absorbents proportion their action to the stimulus which is applied to them : they carry away the serous fluid when jelly is deposited, they remove the jelly as bone is secreted, they afterwards continue to remove the bony particles, as new ones are deposited by the arteries. Bones are supplied with nerves, as well as with arteries and absorbents, they usually pass in with the nutrient vessels, and yet bone is quite insensible. We suffer no pain when periosteum is scraped from the bone, nor when the bone is sawed in amputation ; even the actual cautery produces but a slight feeling of itching and heat. In a healthy state, these nerves appear to send no sensations to the brain ; but when bone is inflamed, its sensibility is roused. Soft parts have their sensibility increased by disease; so bones, ligaments, and cartilages, all parts which in health have very obscure feelings, are roused to a degree of sensibility even exceeding that of other parts. There is no pain greater than that of a wounded joint. Ossification, which begins in the human embryo seven or eight weeks after conception, is at first rapid, but advances more slowly after birth, and is not completed before the twentieth year. It is forwarded by health and strength; retarded by weakness and disease. In scrophulous children, it is imperfectly

USED IN TREATMENT OF DEFORMITIES. 245 from the leg, and it must be obvious, that the closer this is bound to.the upper part of the leg, the more will the foot be drawn out, towards the position it should maintain in relation with the tibia and fibula. A much more simple instrument than this is figured by Dr. Colies in the Dublin Hospital Re- ports, vol. 1.*, and is sufficiently powerful to effect the cure of cases, in the earlier months of infancy : but after this period, and especially when the child has been placed on its feet, the bones of the tarsus are forced into such peculiar positions, that an in- strument of the power of that of Scarpa, becomes requisite. Some machinists place the lever on the inside of the leg, and force the foot in the direction required, by means of one or more curved springs, acting from the lever on an iron shoe into which the foot is fixed. I should have given an engraving of this instrument, which is well adapted for many cases, but machinists do not like to part with their secrets. However, Scarpaâ€™s machine will answer in most cases after infancy, and that of Dr. Colics will be efficient in all new-born infants. In fact, if the in- strument is made to act by an elastic force, and is properly applied to the resistance, it matters little what particular kind we employ : the grand secret of cure, in these cases, is perseverance. * This instrument is much improved by having- the splints at- tached to the shoe by hing-es.

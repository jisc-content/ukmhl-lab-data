27 OF THE MUSCLES. near their head, lies in the hollow of the back be- tween the ribs and spine, and is lost in common with the sacro-lumbalis, in the strong tendon attached to the posterior part of the sacrum, and lumbar verte- brae. This last muscle, lies on the outside of the longissimus dorsi, and arises from the eleven inferior ribs, and transverse processes of the inferior cervical vertebrae. The quadratus luinborum helps to keep the trunk erect, when both muscles act together ; when one only acts, the body is inclined towards one side. The longissimus dorsi and sacro-lumbalis also keep the body erect, and by their attachments to the ribs, must have some power in rotating the spine. These two muscles, with the cervicalis as- cendens, have been considered as divisions of one muscle, and the whole has been properly called, erector spinae. The whole hollow, between the spinous and trans- verse processes and the ribs, is filled up by small muscles and tendons. Muscular and tendinous fi- bres connect all the prominent points, so that an infinity of small muscles might be described, and anatomists have not been wanting in confusing the subject, by a multitude of names. The multifidus spinae, is a comprehensive way of describing what many anatomists have divided into a number of distinct muscles : its fibres pass from the spinous processes to the oblique and transverse processes of succeeding vertebrae, commencing from

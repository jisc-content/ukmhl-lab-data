We occasionally meet with contractions of the elbow, wrist, and finger joints, but very seldom with distortions of the bones, exceut in bad cases of rickets. A SECTION I. OF CONTRACTIONS OF THE ELBOW. Contraction of the elbow, occurs as a consequence of disease in the joint, and of a morbid condition of the biceps muscle. In the first case, we may often restore the use of the joint, but when complete anchylosis has been established, no means for removing the distortion can be prudently resorted to; the other case admits of cure. The primary cause of this latter contraction, is seated in the biceps muscle, the tendon which passes over the articula- tion of the elbow, to be inserted into the tuberosity of the radius, is extraodinarily hard and rigid. The fore-arm is bent on the arm, at different angles, ac-

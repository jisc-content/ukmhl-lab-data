146 Or LATERAL CURVATURE. and may be concealed from any eye by dress: but when there is a very large inflexion of the dorsal vertebrae, the false ribs will approach to the crest of the ileum, and the distorted appearance of the body, will be very great. When the malady has not been of long duration, the scapula is merely raised upwards, but when the subjacent ribs have become very convex externally, the scapula is also projected. The prominence form- ed by this bone, will depend on the seat of the dis- tortion of the ribs, and accordingly we sometimes find the inferior angle the most projecting point, at other times the posterior or internal margin. In very bad cases of lateral curvature, the form of the pelvis is affected, but this is so rare an occur- rence, that it must be considered only as an excep- tion to a general rule. The crest of the ileum on the side opposite to the lumbar curvature, will some- times be elevated, the pelvis will consequently be oblique, and some internal irregularity will occur. The younger the subject the more danger will there be of distortion of the pelvis, which rarely occurs after the age of 12. When the lower limbs are tortuous, and the spinal curvature is connected with rickets, we may expect to find distortion of the pelvis. The weight and pressure of instruments have been charged with compressing, and distorting the pelvis ; if applied to the soft bones of very young children, and considerable pressure used, such effects

160 OF CURVATURE FORWARDS. Many of the ribs being brought into close apposition, the intercostal muscles are rendered useless, and this is another cause of difficulty of breathing. The muscles attached to the prominences of the vertebras, implicated in the curvature, are stretched and diminished in size, and are found after death attenuated, pale and flaccid. The muscular system in the whole frame, suffers as well as in the imme- diate region of the gibbosity, for immobility of the vertebral column produces general inactivity, and impeded respiration is always attended with dimi- nished muscular irritability. The ligaments on the anterior part of the spine, are found in various states of tumefaction and ulce- ration, while the ligaments within the canal, and those connecting the posterior parts of the vertebrae, are generally free from disease. Analogy would lead us to expect that the disease sometimes originates in these parts, but this opinion has not been confirmed by anatomy, opportunities for examination not oc- curring until a late period of the malady, when the bones are also diseased. The destruction of the ligaments, is considered to be a consequence ol the propagation of the malady to them from the bones, but it is not improbable, that the ligaments are sometimes the seat of chronic inflammation, of a similar kind to that which often invades the same tissues in the joints of the limbs. When the bodies of the vertebrae have been wholly

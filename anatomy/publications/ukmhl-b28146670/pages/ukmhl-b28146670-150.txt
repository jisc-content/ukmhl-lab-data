Among the occasional causes of deformity may be mentioned, contractions within the chest. The cavity of the chest, like the cavity of the cranium, is en- tirely filled with its viscera, the parieties are moulded upon their contents, and the proper development of the thorax, depends on the proper development of the lungs and heart. If any portion of the lungs is deficient, there will be a corresponding defect in the containing cavity. Cases of deformity occur from contractions within the chest, after abscess and destruction of portions of lung. Seurat, the man exposed to the gaze of the curious in this town, under the name of “the living skeleton,” was an example of this kind. In the work of Delpech, will be found a detailed account of this man’s case, and many others of a similar kind ; Laenncc has also described numerous instances of the same na- ture. The contraction of the cavities of abcesses in the lungs, draws inward the corresponding ribs, and bends the spine laterally or anteriorly.

USED IN TREATMENT OF DEFORMITIES. 237 pear when the body is in exercise, and that it is in sitting or standing that the muscles first give way. Seats with crutches, spine-supporters, &c. may be employed in such cases of muscular debility without mischief, but when the bones are diseased, on no account should they be permitted, at no period of such malady can they be otherwise than prejudicial; repose is the fundamental principle in the treatment of these cases and should be most rigidly adhered to. When such instruments are employed the sim- pler their structure, and the more easy their applica- tion the better. Several contrivances have been adopted for ex- tending the spine. By some the compound pulley is employed : the patient being seated in a chair in a door-way or other convenient place, and the cord fixed to straps connected with proper pads under the chin, jaws, and occiput, the head is gradually ele- vated. This mode of extension is objectionable, inasmuch as it acts chiefly on the cervical vertebne. The most safe and most satisfactory mode of exten- sion is effected in the recumbent position of the body, and may be accomplished by assistants, or machin- ery. Our continental neighbours have invented a great deal of machinery for this purpose: some of their extending couches and chairs are specimens of the most complex apparatus. If such an object can- not be accomplished with simplicity, we may gene- rally conclude that there is something wrong in the

10 OF CARTILAGE AND LIGAMENT. from jars than they would do without the covering of this elastic substance. Cartilage is a semi-pellucid substance, holding a middle rank in point of firmness, between bone and other parts of the frame. When cut, its texture appears homogeneous ; there are no cells, cavities, or pores, but it resembles in section, a piece of glue. It is very elastic, and on this account, it enters into the formation of all parts, the functions of which require a combination of firmness, with pliancy and flexibility, the preservation of a certain external form, with the faculty of yielding to external force, or pressure. Cartilage is covered by a membrane similar in texture and appearance to periosteum : nutrient ves- sels are supplied by its intervention. Absorbents cannot be demonstrated in cartilage, but their exist- ence is proved by many phenomena, as the conver- sion of cartilage into bone, and the removal of this substance in diseased joints. All the bones, except the teeth, are formed in a nidus of cartilage. The bones are tied together by strong unyielding cords and membranes, called ligaments : these keep the surfaces of joints in proper apposition, and re- strict their motions to certain directions. The in- ternal surface of the capsular ligaments is lined with a membrane, which secretes a fluid called synovia, calculated to promote facility of motion, and obvi- ate friction.

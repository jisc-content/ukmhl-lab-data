USED IN TREATMENT OF DEFORMITIES. 23l) The foregoing sketch is taken from Delpech, and but for his well-established reputation as a surgeon, we might be disposed to smile at the apparent ab- surdity of such complicated machinery. Concealed within the frame of bed are pullies, wheels, and springs innumerable, to effect the simple purpose of extension. Any benefit that can result from such an apparatus, must be derived from the power of extension, in overcoming the rigidity of ligaments and the contractions of muscles, exactly on the same principle that it is employed in the contracted joints of the extremities. The essential purpose of all the complex machinery of the French will be effected by a screw, similar to that of the tourniquet, acting on a bandage round the pelvis, the head being fixed in one of the common head-pieces of the inclined-plane, or by an apparatus similar to that represented in the sketch. Those who are curious in machinery will find descriptions of a great variety of instruments used for distortions in the works of Delpech and Lafond. The latter has a large Orthopedique at Paris, where he employs what he terms “ Machines Oscillatoires” in the cure of every kind of deformity. He is evi- dently a most ingenious machinist, and no doubt many inveterate cases have yielded to such means, which had resisted the more common modes of treatment. But M. Delpech appears to have been equally successful in his mode of treatment, with

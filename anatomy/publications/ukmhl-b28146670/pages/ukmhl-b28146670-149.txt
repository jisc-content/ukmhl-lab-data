ON SPINAL DISTORTIONS. 127 readily sec that the primary cause of distortions is sometimes seated in the muscles, sometimes in the ligaments or cartilages, and sometimes in the bones. As the mode of treatment is essentially different in these varieties, it is imperative on us to discover the original cause of the mischief: for as it is wiser, and more effectual, to attack the causes rather than the effects of disease, so the trouble of the investi- gation will amply repay us. At one time it was the fashion to place all persons with deformed spines in the recumbent position, so to remain for one or more years. Now, it is obvious that if the cause of the deformity, lies in a deficiency of muscular power, total inactivity will not be very likely to remedy the disease, and it was therefore no uncommon occur- rence to see persons after going through this ordeal, becoming at the end of the course of treatment worse than at the beginning ; for such a state of disease, the simple remedy is muscular exercise, variously modified. Now the exercises of gymnastics in cases of inflammation of the fibro-cartilages, or caries of the bones, would clearly increase the cause of the distortion ; in these instances, repose in the recum- bent position, is the essential feature of the manage- ment. The earliest source of deformities of the spine is rickets, cases from this cause mostly occur in the first ten years of life. The next general cause is muscular debility, and produces its effect on girls

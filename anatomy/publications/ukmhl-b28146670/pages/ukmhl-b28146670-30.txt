8 OF THE FORMATION AND which in young subjects is filled with a reddish serous fluid, and in adults with marrow. The use of the marrow has not been determined : in herbi- vorous animals it is hard when cold, but always re- mains fluid in those which are carnivorous : it is contained in fine membranous cells. The branches of arteries ramify on these cells as well as the inter- nal periosteum. In the centre of long bones the cavity is almost circular, the bone is very solid, and its fibrous matter condensed ; but at the extremities the cavity is irregular, and intersected with shoots of bone across it, forming a complicated net-work. The ends of bones are always of a more spongy tex- ture than the shafts ; where, although the bone is smaller, the substance is so much more condensed, that an equal length of the two parts will be found of nearly equal weight. This spongy reticulated structure of the ends of bone, consists of what have been termed cancelli, these are lined with a delicate membrane, and this membrane covers every division of the lattice-work, forming each cell into a distinct cavity. The bones are every where covered with a tough fibrous membrane, called periosteum; it adheres closely to the bone, communicates with it by innu- merable vessels, and forms a medium of attachment for the soft parts, all the muscles being inserted into it, either directly, or by tendons, and not into the bone itself.

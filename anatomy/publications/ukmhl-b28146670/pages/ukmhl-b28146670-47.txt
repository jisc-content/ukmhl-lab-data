25 OF THE MUSCLES. of gravity of the whole body to fall within the space occupied by them ; these circumstances occur in no other animal among the mammalia, and there- fore man alone of this class, can long maintain the erect position. Those which approach nearest to him in this respect, as the plantigrade animals, have the greatest facility in assuming the erect attitude ; every body has witnessed this in the bear. In man the whole tarsus, metatarsus and toes, rest on the ground, while in quadrupeds, for example the horse, the os calcis is raised half way up the leg, and what in these animals is called the knee, is in fact the joints of the tarsus in the posterior, and the carpus in the anterior extremity. The extensor muscles of the ankle-joint, forming the calf of the leg, in quadrupeds, and even in monkeys, bear no proportion to their superior mag- nitude in man, whose peculiar mode ot progression required this developement. They not only raise the os calcis in the motions of the body, but when the foot is fixed in standing, they counteract that tendency which the weight of the body has, to bend the knee. The gluteus maximus, which forms the great bulk of the buttock, is so small and insignificant in quad- rupeds, that it can hardly be said to exist. This muscle extends the pelvis on the thigh in standing, and, assisted by the other glutei, maintains that part *n a state of equilibrium on the extremity which

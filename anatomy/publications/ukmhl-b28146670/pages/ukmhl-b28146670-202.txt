180 OF SPINAL DISTORTION FROM from defective muscular power, the bones are not altered in their form until the deviation has been of very long continuance. This fact is of great impor- tance in respect to the possibility of effacing the distortion ; instances have occurred, in which deformities from this cause have been entirely re- moved, even after the growth of the body has ceased. The pelvis is never deformed in cases originating in defective muscular action. This is a most im- portant circumstance, and by a little attention to the diagnostic symptoms of the various kinds of defor- mity, much unnecessary alarm may be prevented. Mr. Shawâ€™s observations on this subject are so just, and lead to such valuable inferences, that they can- not be too widely diffused. In all distortions of the pelvis, there will be found evidence of rickets, or other disease of the osseous system. It is well known, that ladies with consi- derable lateral curvatures of the spine, have very easy labours; and on the other hand, the pelvis will be very much distorted, where the spine is not at all so. The pelvis will seldom be found affected, unless the distortion of the spine began in early childhood. However twisted or curved the back may be, if the long bones of the extremities evince none of the effects of rickets, we may expect to find the pelvis free from deformity. When the curva- ture has been established after the age of twelve, the

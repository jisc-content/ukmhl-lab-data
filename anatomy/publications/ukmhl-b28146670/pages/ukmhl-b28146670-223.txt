201 DISEASE OF THE FIBRO-CARTILAGES. vances, it' the principal functions, especially the di- gestive, are correctly performed : it increases lapidly under the opposite circumstances, and may be traced in its progress to other vertebrse, above and below the primary point of attack. According to the observations of Delpech, the vertebrae in this form of disease may be moved in a horizontal direction, that is to say, by pressing on the spinous processes the bodies ot the vertebrae may be forced inwards, in consequence ot the thickening and extreme softness of the fibro-cartilages, and the relaxed state of the ligaments. I have never had an opportunity of verifying this observation, which is very important, for if it be correct, a partial luxa- tion of the cervical and lumbar, if not of the dorsal vertebrae, may be readily supposed to occur, and the views of Dr. Harrison deserve more attention than they have received. Delpech relates cases where one or two vertebrae deviated in an opposite direction to that of the general curvature, which are in fact examples of partial luxation. In children of scrophulous constitutions, this dis- ease will attack the whole course of the interverte- bral cartilages: the little patients are fatigued by the smallest exertion, they like repose, and take no part in the exercises, or amusements of their age. They suffer from frequent and inexplicable derange- ments ot the digestive functions, palpitation of the heart, oppression, and pain at the epigastrium. They

ON THE MECHANICAL APPARATUS 240 machinery more approaching to simplicity than that of Lafond. Mr. Shaw has given a representation of an appa- ratus employed by him for extending the lumbar region of the spine: it consists of moveable boards on an inclined plane, and will be readily understood by referring to his folio plates, or to the wood-cuts in his octavo volumes, in which will also be found many ingenious contrivances applicable to the treat- ment of spinal curvatures. In recent and slight cases of lateral curvature, the elevated shoulder and projecting hip may be remov- ed by extension, and we may demonstrate the opinion, the accuracy of which is generally doubted, that these are merely consequences of spinal curva- ture, and not primary and essential deformities. The following wood-cut is copied from Delpcch, and represents a contrivance by which exercise can be employed by convalescents from spinal diseases, and in all cases where it is not yet proper to allow the weight of the upper parts of the body to press on the spine. By means of this apparatus, as with Mr. Shawâ€™s inclined plane, a person can take exer- cise while in the recumbent position. The inclina- tion of the machine with the horizon, may be altered to suit the strength of the individual using it: when perfectly horizontal the exertion required to move forward is trifling, by raising its inclination, the ex- ercise will be rendered more difficult, and bettei

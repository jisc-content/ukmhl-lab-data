disease of the fibro-cartilages. 199 In many of the preparations of distorted spine, preserved in museums, we find the bodies of the vertebrae very little, or not at all, changed in form ; the altered dimensions of their intermediate spaces being sufficient to account for the tortuosities of the whole column. In recent morbid specimens of this kind of distortion, the difference in the thickness of the fibro-cartilages from one side to the other is very perceptible; but, in those where the soft parts have been destroyed by maceration, it is sometimes diffi- cult to judge of the real nature of things ; however, we sometimes meet with preparations where the vertebrae are held together by exostoses, and the vacant intervertebral spaces, give the idea of an in- terposed body, the thickness of which was greater in some points of its circumference than in others. In many cases this oblique form of the cartilages is in harmony with the general curvature of a whole region of the spine. In the dorsal region, where curvatures from this cause most frequently occur, the thickest part of the fibro-cartilages will be on the right and the thinnest on the left. Where there are two curvatures in opposite directions, the differ- ence of thickness in the circumference of the carti- lages, follows the course of the inversion ; thus in the loins, where the curvature is in the opposite direction to that of the back, the cartilages will be thickest on the left side. In the majority of anatomical investigations, the

IS OF THE STRUCTURE OF THE VERTEBRAL COLUMN. required ; greater in the loins, and greatest of all in the neck, to allow the free motion of the head. In order to afford a passage for the spinal cord, each bone is perforated, and the perforation corresponds with others, so that an entire, close, uninterrupted canal is formed from one end to the other. The contrivance to prevent the bones shifting, and breaking the line of the canal, and also to prevent gaping between them, is very admirable. The ver- tebrae, by means of processes and projections, some of which articulate with those of the next bone, are so confined that their bases remain nearly unaltered, the whole pressure produced by flexion is thrown on the intervening cartilage, formed of a substance so springy and elastic, as to allow the requisite mo- tion, without any chasm between the bones. The number of vertebrae, and consequently ot joints, so divides the chain, that the motion of each bone is trifling, although we bend our backs to almost any degree of inclination: had the joints been fewer, the spinal cord would have been endan- gered at every angle. The oblique processes add much security against luxation : these so lock into and overlap each other, that the bodies of the vertebrae are secured from slipping, and no degree of violence short of that, which will fracture the bones, can force them out of their places. The ligaments, connecting the roots of the spinous processes, are strong and highly

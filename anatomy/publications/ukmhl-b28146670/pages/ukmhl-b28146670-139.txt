The mutual dependance of the lungs and chest is further proved, from the great benefit derived by persons on the verge of consumption, who have gone through those exercises by which the muscles of respiration are brought into action. With regard to medical treatment: we must regu- late the organs of nutrition by the persevering use of simple, and sufficiently nutrient diet: hyd. c. creta and pulv. rhei. are equally useful in this mala- dy, as in rickets : tonics are beneficial, and of these carbonate of iron is one of the best.

74 DEFORMITIES FROM MALFORMATION dispositions, is a decided lameness, on one, or both sides, and sometimes total incapacity of progressive motion. The following account of this malformation, is principally taken from a memoir in the second vo- lume of the Repertoire G4neralc d’Anatomie, by M. Dupuytren, who has admirably described both the symptoms and the anatomy. An illustration of this kind of deformity, will also be found in Cruveilheir’s “Anatomie Pathologique.5’ The deformity is principally constituted, by a transposition of the head of the femur, from the acetabulum, into the external iliac fossa, similar to cases of dislocation of that bone, upwards and out- wards. The limb is shortened, the great trochanter is unusually elevated and prominent, almost all the muscles of the superior part of the thigh, arc drawn upwards, towards the crest of the ileum, the tube- rosity of the ischium is more than commonly ex- posed, and the limb is rotated inwards, throwing the heel out and the toes in. The obliquity of the thigh from above, downwards, and inwards, is greater than ordinary, and increases as the child advances in age, and, the pelvis becomes more developed : an acute angle is formed, at the upper and inner part of the thigh, where it joins the pelvis, the thighs have a tendency to cross each other, and there is emaciation of the whole extremity, especially at its upper part.

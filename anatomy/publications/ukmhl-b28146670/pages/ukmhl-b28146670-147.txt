OBSERVATIONS ON SPINAL DISTORTIONS. 125 beyond the external symptoms, and profess to cure all deformities by external force. Mr. Pott was the first who called in the aid of anatomy and physiology to the elucidation of spinal diseases, and we are indebted to him for leading the way in a rational investigation of this class of mala- dies. Many of his opinions have been modified by subsequent enquiry, but in that variety of disease to which his observations are especially directed, his descriptions are as valuable as ever. For many years after th© death of Pott, surgeons appear to have remained satisfied with his Essay, the disease was called by his name both here and on the Con- tinent : “ Maladie de Pott” is still its designation in France. When a surgeon was applied to in any case of spinal distortion, issues were made on each side of the most prominent vertebrae, of course in many instances to no purpose, and mechanics often got into credit for curing deformities, which had derived no benefit from the advice of the most cele- brated surgeons. The beginning of the present century will proba- bly be, in future ages, considered as an sera in the natural sciences. A new impulse has been given, more correct methods of investigation have been adopted, and these have been followed by general conclusions more useful and satisfactory, than in any preceding age of the world. It would hardly be exaggeration to say, that the natural sciences have

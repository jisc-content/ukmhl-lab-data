At a more advanced stage, ulceration or absorp- tion of the bodies of one or more vertebra;, will have taken place, and a decided curvature, or angular projection will be established. In the worst cases there will be loss of power, or total paralysis of the lower extremities, from extension of inflammation to, or pressure upon, the spinal marrow. In these cases we must have recourse to that mode of treat- ment, the principle of which originated with Mr. Pott: to produce eschars on each side of the curva- ture, by the application of caustic, or what is in my opinion more efficacious, by tnoxas. In young chil- dren some practitioners prefer a seton.

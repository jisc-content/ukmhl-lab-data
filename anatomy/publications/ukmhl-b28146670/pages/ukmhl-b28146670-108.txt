86 OF DISTORTIONS AND CONTRACTIONS strains. At each effort of walking, there is displace- ment of the bones, almost amounting to dislocation : the internal condyle of the femur, appears as if it would escape from the articulation : the semilunar cartilage of this side is distended, enlarged, and thrust out of its place. When the mischief has been of long standing, and, when the leg is bent much outwards, the articular ligaments become so much altered in their structure, that the deformity can never be entirely removed. Rickets, or softness of the bones, from other causes, give rise to this distortion, either by pro- ducing an incurvation of the body of the femur, or of the tibia, near the articulation, or by inducing that condition of the bones, which permits them to be crushed by the superincumbent weight. This deformity has been caused by the destruction of the external condyle of the femur. Cicatrices with loss of substance of skin, and subjacent tissue, from burns and other accidents, have produced this, as well as many other distortions. The unusual shortness of the extensor, or flexor muscles of the leg, may be noticed as an occasional cause; in the first case the leg is drawn forwards, as well as out- wards : in the second, it is retained in a bent posi- tion : in both, the patella deviates considerably out- wards. Muscular debility, connected as it always is, with a relaxed condition of the ligaments, is a cause of

12 STRUCTURE OF THE FOOT. placed in front of the chest, is a flat bone, which in youth consists of several pieces: the ribs are all ar- ticulated with the vertebra of the back, form an ir- regular circle forwards, and, with the exception of two, are united to the sternum by cartilages. The pelvis is formed by the iliac or haunch bones, the sacrum, and the coccyx. The upper extremity consists of the clavicle and scapula, or shoulder-bones ; the humerus, or arm- bone ; the radius and ulna, or bones of the fore-arm ; the eight small bones of the carpus or wrist; the five metacarpal bones ; and the phalanges of the fingers. The bones of the lower extremity are analogous. The femur, or thigh-bone, articulated with the pel- vis ; the tibia and fibula, forming the leg ; the patella, or knee-cap: the foot is formed by the seven bones of the tarsus, the five metatarsal bones, and the phalanges of the toes. The bones of the tarsus are the astragalus, to which the leg is articulated^ the calcis or heel-bone, the scaphoidcs or navicularc, the cuboides, and the three cuneiform, or wedge- like bones. We shall often have occasion to refer to these bones in speaking of club-foot. There are no less than twenty-six bones in the human foot, and almost as many joints. Each ar- ticulation is covered with cartilage, the surface of which is smooth: there is a delicate membrane from bone to bone, secreting a lubricating fluid. Exter-

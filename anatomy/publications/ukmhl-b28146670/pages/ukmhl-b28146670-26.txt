4 OF THE FORMATION AND assumes a white or yellow hue, the redness retreat- ing to the ends of the bone, and entirely going off, as this acquires its full development. As ossifica- tion proceeds, it buries the vessels by which it was formed, the appearance of vascularity being entirely concealed, by the hardness and density of the bony fibres. The great vascularity of the living bone, may be familiarly illustrated, by holding the hand before a strong light, when the phalanges of the fingers appear perfectly transparent. This is also seen in preparations of injected bones, where the earthy matter having been removed, by maceration in acid, leaves the gelatine traversed by vessels, in such profusion, that it may bear comparison in point of vascularity, with any of the softer parts of the body. The quantity of osseous matter in the bones at the time of birth, is only sufficient to give them firmness, without preventing flexibility, and thus the foetus is better fitted to pass through the pelvis, than it would be if ossification was more perfect. The heads of the long bones are, in all young animals, separated from the shaft by cartilage ; in the human subject, they are not consolidated before the age of 15 or 20. The structure of these parts is always more spongy than the rest of the bone, and, in rickety and scrophulous children, they exhibit to the experienced eye, early indications of disease. Bone is a secretion from the blood ; it contains in

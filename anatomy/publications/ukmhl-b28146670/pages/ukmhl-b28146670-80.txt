5S ON RICKETS. One-of the most striking peculiarities of the ra- chitic condition of the osseous system, is, that al- though the bones present the characters enumerated above, during tbe continuance of the disease, if this be checked, they afterwards acquire equal, and even greater firmness and density than sound bones. While this change is taking place, the distinction between the cancellated and compact structure be- gins to be established, as well as the formation of the medullary canal. When this process once com- mences, it proceeds much as in healthy bone. In one respect, however, its completion is peculiar. In- stead of the compact matter of bone, being equally distributed on each side of the medullary canal, as in sound bone, it is more abundant on the concave than on the convex side of the incurvated bone ; as if Nature was aware of the part where firmness was most wanted, and intended to defend the skeleton against any increase of deformity, by depositing earthy matter in the best situation to resist the ef- fects of pressure. This deposition may be so con- siderable in bones which are much bent, as to ob- literate entirely the medullary canal. The restored rachitic bone is said to contain more earthy matter than healthy bone. In the disease called mollifies ossium, the bones gradually lose their firmness, and become soft and flexible: it is a disease of adults. In this affection the absorbents would appear to be principally in fault, in rickets the secerning arteries

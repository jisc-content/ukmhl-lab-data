Respi- ration is always more or less impeded and pulmonic complaints are frequent. Oxygenation of the blood is not effectually performed, the lips, cheeks, nails, &c. often exhibiting that bluish tinge, so indicative of derangement of the respiratory functions. The ribs and sternum often approach so nearly to the pelvis, that we are surprised to find the functions of these parts carried on so well. On the principle which we have had frequent occasion to mention, that muscles lose their power when their insertions are preternaturally approximated, we may account for the want of proper action in the abdominal muscles, without attributing it, in all cases, to paralysis. This, however, does occasionally occur, according to Mr. Copelandâ€™s observations. The length of the trunk being shortened by the curvature forwards, the thoracic viscera unusually press on the diaphragm, which forces down the liver and abdominal contents ; and thus is produced, in part at least, that tumidity of belly, which is one of the characteristics of these complaints. By the sinking of the thorax, and its approximation to the pelvis, the abdominal muscles and the diaphragm are shortened, and until their structure accommodates itself to this change, they do not contract as it is necessary they should do, for the healthy action of the digestive, as well as the respiratory functions.

OF SPINAL DISTORTION FROM 22S encourage the unremitted continuance of the reme- dial means. The most important feature in the treatment of these cases, is absolute repose, and so essential is it, that mechanical means must be sometimes resorted to, fully to effect it. Stays are recommended by some practitioners to prevent any motion of the ribs, or bones of the spine amongst themselves, and may be beneficial if well made and confine the motions of the trunk, without compressing the diseased parts. The new osseous productions, which restore the con- tinuity of the spine, are at first of a very delicate structure, and the slightest motion will endanger them. The density of the ligaments is diminished, and in cases where the abraded surfaces of the bones rub on each other, perfect immobility is most diffi- cult to accomplish. The patient must be placed on a bed, to which his body can be fixed in an effica- cious manner, and which is so contrived that his issues may be easily dressed without any change of position. If the deformity produced by this disease has not made much progress, the constant horizontal posi- tion of the body, may effect a reduction, or an entire removal of the spinal deviation. These are the cases where we are justified, in keeping our patients for a year or more, in an undeviating recumbent position, and it is only by perseverance in this, with the assistance of other means, that we can hope to

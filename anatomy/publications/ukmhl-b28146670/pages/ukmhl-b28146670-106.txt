OF DISTORTIONS AND CONTRACTIONS 84 SECTION III. OF DISTORTIONS AND CONTRACTIONS OF THE KNEE- JOINT. The principal distortions of the knee, occur in two directions : in one, the knee is thrown outwards and the foot inwards, and when this deviation takes place on both sides, the knees are unnaturally se- parated, the soles of the feet approximated, and the weight of the body falls on the outer edge of the foot; in the other case, the reverse of this occurs, the leg is thrown out, and the-knees are brought close together, forming the distortion, commonly known by the name of “ in-knee.” This latter kind of deformity is of much more frequent occurrence than the former, and is gene- rally complicated, with some degree of torsion of the bones of the leg, or of the ankle-joint. In these cases, the natural inclination of the leg out- wards, from the axis of the thigh, is greatly exag- gerated : a considerable angle is formed between the thigh and leg: the knees are sometimes so approximated, that when the patient is standing, he cannot place them side by side, but is obliged to carry one behind the other. Some degree of twist is usually added to this deformity, and we find the patella, instead of looking directly forwards.

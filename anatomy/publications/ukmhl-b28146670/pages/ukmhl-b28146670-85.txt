ON RICKETS. G.'i extremities, properly adapted instruments, will as- sist their restoration, and enable the patient to take some degree of exercise. It is better in very young children to defer the use of mechanical means, un- til the bones of the trunk have acquired some firm- ness, and those of the limbs are hard enough not to be injured by the weight and pressure of the instru- ments. We often meet with gross, heavy children, of lax fibre, flabby muscles, distended abdomen, with large joints, and spongy extremities of bones, especially of the wrists and ankles. This is an incipient state of rickets. The extension of the disease is gener- ally prevented by occasional mercurial purgatives, and proper attention to food : but the bones of the leg bend under the weight of the body, and the li- gaments of the knee-joint are apt to be elongated, producing what is called knock-knees. These ef- fects are readily removed by a persevering use of mechanical means.

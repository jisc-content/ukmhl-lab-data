88 OF DISTORTIONS AND CONTRACTIONS the mischief stops in this manner, is not the same in all individuals, and we occasionally see the legs reduced almost to a horizontal direction. Where it occurs to this extent, the deformity is hideous, and impedes all motion: to stop its progress, and to efface its effects is therefore of great importance. The cases most difficult of cure, are those depen- dant on a rickety or other diseased condition of the bones. Nevertheless, if the original cause of the mischief has been arrested, if the health has been restored, the persevering use of mechanical means constantly acting on the distortion, and preventing its increase, by supporting the superincumbent weight, will often overcome very great deformity. We may almost invariably effect an alteration in the form of bent bones, and distorted joints, by taking advantage of the favourable changes, which the development of the skeleton affords, during the period of growth. In slight cases of in-knee, or bow tegs, nothing more is required than a shoe with a sole of unequal thickness: in the first case, the internal margin of the sole should be the thickest, and in the other, the reverse. If this simple means be attended to, the constant adduction and abduction of the foot, will in time influence the knee, and insensibly res- tore it to its natural position. Where the child is young, this treatment will generally be successful, and its benefits will be greatly increased by the use of friction, and other means to strengthen the mus-

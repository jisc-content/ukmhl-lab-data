GROWTH OF IJONE. O its structure arteries for nutrition, and absorbents for the removal of worn-out particles, like other parts of the frame. Health depends on the regular deposition, absorption, moulding, and forming of parts. Nothing can be more worthy our admira- tion than the continual renovation and change of particles, even in the hardest bone. Changes, which we conjecture by fair analogy with respect to the soft parts, we know by direct experiment to occur in the bones. It was by accident discovered, that animals, fed on the refuse of madder, employed by dyers, had their bones tinged of a deep red colour. This led to experiments, and it was found, that when madder was given to animals, withheld for some time, and then given again, the colour appears in the bones, and goes away with such rapidity, as proves a deposition and absorption truly wonderful. All the bones are tinged in twenty-four hours, in two or three days the colour becomes very deep, and if the food be changed, in a few days the red colour will be entirely removed. By the microscope it was easy to distinguish, that the colour was mixed with the bony structure only, the vessels, like those of the rest of the body, having no tinge. The earthy matter, which constitutes the hardness and all the useful proper- ties of bone, is dead and inorganic; it lies in the interstices of the gelatine, which gives it consistence and strength. In a broken limb, there is first a thin effusion, then a tremulous jelly, then radiating

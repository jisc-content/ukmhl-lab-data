Congenital inequality in the form of the corres- pondent organs, on the two sides of the body, as a cause of deformity, has not been much attended to. Among children, in whose persons deformities of the spine, or limbs, make their appearance, at a very early age, some will exhibit well-marked dif- ferences in the development of the two sides of the body : that side which corresponds to the distor- tion, will present a diminutive size in all its parts, when compared with the other.

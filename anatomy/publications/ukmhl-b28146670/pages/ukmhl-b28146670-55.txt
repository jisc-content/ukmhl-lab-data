33 ON UNIFORMITIES. These are among the cases which require the most persevering attention, because the ligaments being greatly extended, it is long before they can recovei their natural firmness; these deformities are there- fore ever threatening a recurrence. Contractions from accident, or disease of skin and cellular tissue, are more formidable than muscular contractions. Nothing can surpass the force, with which the cicatrix of a burn, will contract the arm, or the foot; and equally great is the power of con- tracted cysts, after the cure of abscesses in the lungs, by which the vertebrae are drawn out of their line, and the ribs bent inwards. In some examples of club-foot, we perceive the degree to which the ligaments may be extended, by congenital defect of the muscles. In these cases, there is a peculiar difficulty with respect to the liga- ments : for as long as the growth of the body con- tinues, the original disproportion between the short muscles and the bones will be felt, if artificial means are not constantly applied, to the defective organs, to maintain their elongation. Any alteration in the natural form of the skeleton, will induce a physical change in the state of the muscles. Muscles are disposed in such manner, as to be submitted to a certain degree of tension : the forms, determined by the bones being changed, these . relations are also changed, and the extremities of the muscles are no longer fixed at proper distances.

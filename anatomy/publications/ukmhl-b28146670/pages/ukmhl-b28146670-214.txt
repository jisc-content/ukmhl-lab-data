We are recommended to make use of sheet lead, to press on the prominent part of the ribs, but where such an expedient is at all requisite, the pressure of a spring as advised in the cure of pigeon-breast is preferable. Advantage will be derived, during the process of extension, from the employment of pressure on the curved portions of the spine, and also on the projecting parts of the ribs. The po- sition may be varied from the back to the face, ac- cording to the feelings of the patient. Mr. Bamp- field recommends a constant facial position, but as far as I have observed, this is more irksome, and endured more impatiently, than the usual method of lying on the back.

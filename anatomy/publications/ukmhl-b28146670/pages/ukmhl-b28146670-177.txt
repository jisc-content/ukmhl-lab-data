OF CURVATURE FORWARDS. 155 will sink at this point, and the spinous processes will be very prominent. We may readily imagine the mischief done in such cases by shampooers and others, who see nothing but dislocation of the ver- tebrae, in such projections. The bodies of the vertebrae are seldom entirely destroyed, that portion which forms the anterior part of the spinal canal, is the last to be affected, and in most instances escapes altogether, so as to leave the canal continuous and undiminished in calibre. This portion of the bone is of a more compact texture, than the spongy body, and like the spinous and transverse processes not so liable to disease. In very bad cases these processes are found anchylosed, but never carious. In the whole circle of medicine, there are few more interesting reflections than those which arise in viewing the evident provisions of Nature, for the protection of the spinal brain. Not only is the canal defended by the more indestruc- tible nature of the bone which immediately sur- rounds it, than that of the rest of the bodies of the vertebrae, but when this is so diseased that the weight of the body must soon crush the spinal cord, an attempt is made to uphold the column, by the deposition of bony matter between the spinous pro- cesses, producing such a degree of anchylosis as will sufficiently support the spine, and preserve the func- tions of its important contents. 1 he spinal canal ol course follows the disposition

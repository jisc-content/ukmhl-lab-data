154 OF CURVATURE FORWARDS. and their connexion with the ribs, prevents the ex- trusion of one or two, without drawing others into the curve. In the lumbar and cervical regions, these distortions will approach more to the form of an angle, than in the dorsal region. The upper part of the spine will sometimes form a right angle with the lower; in some dreadful cases even an acute angle has been formed. (See plate 4.) As the disease advances the patient becomes inca- pable of maintaining the erect position, and in sitting he is obliged to support the upper part of his body, by resting his elbows on a table. The lower ex- tremities sometimes become paralysed, especially in that degree of curvature forwards, which has been termed angular projection. The form and the extent of the curvature, depends on the number of the vertebrae, or fibro-cartilages compressed, or removed, as well as on the situation of the disease. When the bodies of many vertebrae are destroyed, the curve will approach to an ellipsis or an angle, but the degree of curvature will also de- pend on the depth to which the bones are corroded. Sometimes many vertebrae are affected, but the osseous matter absorbed, or destroyed is not great, because the effects of the disease are confined to the anterior surface of the bodies : hence there luay be very extensive absorption, or caries, with little or no deformity. On the other hand the bodies of one or two vertebrae may be entirely removed, the column

Ill OF THE PES EQUINUS. Â«to become almost perpendicular to the tibia. There is a great concavity in the sole, and much convexity on the dorsum of the foot. When the deformity has been of some duration, the anterior part of the foot, on which the patient walks, and especially the great toe, become proportionally stronger, and more voluminous than the posterior part. The leg after some time, partakes of the malady, for since the patient cannot so well make use of this, as the sound foot, the muscles and bones are imperfectly nourished, and their development is consequently impeded. This deformity is not preceded by any alteration in the osseous system. The essential feature of the disease is a shortening of the muscles of the calf of the leg, and consequent tension of their common tendon, which is extremely rigid and hardened. Other muscles are implicated, as the plantaris, the tibialis posticus, peroneus longus, which being shortened, concur in augmenting the malady. Any accident or other cause, that can effect a permanent contraction of these muscles, will produce this de- formity, but it is generally congenital. It seldom happens that more than one foot is affected. Progression is impeded to a great degree: for the articulation of the foot with the leg being destroyed, the patient is always obliged to place the deformed foot before the sound one. Walking on the toes is of course fatiguing and insecure, and it

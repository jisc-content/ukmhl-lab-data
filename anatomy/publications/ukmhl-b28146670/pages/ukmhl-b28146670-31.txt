9 GROWTH OF BONE. Thus we find no essential difference of organiza- tion in bones, and in the softer parts of the body : in every bone there exists arteries for the deposition, and absorbents for the removal of the earthy and gelatinous matter, which constitute it; cellular sub- stance for the connexion of its parts, and nerves to animate the whole. Bony fibres are formed and renovated, undergo change and removal in the same manner, and from the same causes as other parts. The extraordinary alterations of form in the bones of the cranium, is a fact too well established to ad- mit of doubt. Models have been taken of the form of the cranium of the same individual at different ages, and the changes have been found to be very remarkable : nor is this alteration of form confined to the period of growth, for after that has long ter- minated, the form of the bones of the cranium will continue to change. How far this alteration de- pends on growth of brain we shall not here discuss, but however we may doubt many of the general conclusions of the phrenologists, we must acknow- ledge to them a debt of gratitude, for the establish- ment of this, and many other interesting facts. The articulating extremities of the bones, are in every instance covered with a thin crust of cartilage, having its surface most exquisitely polished, by which all friction is avoided, the ends of the bones glide over each other with facility, and suffer less

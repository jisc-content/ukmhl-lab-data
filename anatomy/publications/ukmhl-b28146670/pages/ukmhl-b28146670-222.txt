200 OF SPINAL DISTORTION FROM intumescence has been found to affect several of the intervertebral cartilages, but in some instances it is limited to a small number of them. From the man- ner in which these cases proceed, it would appear that the affection has its origin in one point of the spine, from whence it spreads to others ; however, the disease will sometimes attack a large portion of the column simultaneously. Unfortunately, the early symptoms of this malady are very equivocal, and many of them are equally characteristic of other derangements. Sometimes there will be fixed pain in one or more points of the spine, but it is often so general that the precise seat of the disease is but vaguely indicated. Sometimes the only pain felt is in the epigastrium or flanks.â€” The first deviation is very indistinct; the direction is determined by the greater or less thickness of any point of the circumference of the fibro-cartilages; from which circumstance we have in this disease distortions in every direction before or behind, but most commonly to the right, or left. If, at the same time, any cause of complication exists, as inequality in the length of the lower extremities : a cicatrix on the external surface, or within the chest: a constant and peculiar attitude: any of these may determine the direction in which the distortion shall take place. The deviation is, at its origin, not only slight, but disappears when the patient is in bed ; is not at all apparent in the morning, and makes but slow ad-

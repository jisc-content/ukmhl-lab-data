In the progress of the disease the skin becomes diy and scaly, the teeth are discoloured and decay early ; the extremities of the hones appear swoln j the joints, especially those of the wrist and ankle, are larger than natural ; there is great disinclination to move, from the incapacity of the bones to support the weight of the body : the mesenteric and other glands are sometimes enlarged and indurated ; the internal functions greatly impaired ; and if the dis- ease is not arrested, the lungs, to which the same strumous tendency extends, which has already af- fected other parts, become tuberculated, these sup- purate, and a miserable state of existence is at length terminated. Rickets is often considered to be a consequence of teething ; the fact appears to be, that the same causes, which engender rickets, retard dentition. An increased degree of curvature in the clavicles, and unnatural projection of the sternum forwards, are often the earliest indications of the existence of this disease. The upper extremities are always less deformed than the lower, the bones are bent from muscular action alone, and acquire a direction for- wards, from the preponderating influence of the flexors. The femur has its concavity backwards, the weight of the body augmenting its natural curve;

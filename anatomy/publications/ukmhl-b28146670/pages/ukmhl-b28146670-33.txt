11 OF THE SKELETON. There is a peculiar substance, partaking ot the properties of both cartilage and ligament, placed between the bodies of the bones of the spine, which permits a sufficiency of motion of the vertebral co- lumn, without weakening the support it is destined to afford to the upper parts of the body in general, and to the head in particular. These fibro-carti- lages give to the spine a high degree ot elasticity, by which the concussion of any violent motion is weakened or destroyed, before it can be communi- cated to the head. OF THE SKELETON. The skeleton is the frame work, serving for the support and protection of the soft parts of animals. In man and in the higher classes of animals, it is symmetric, the two sides of the mesial line being exactly similar. The skeleton is divided into three parts ; head, trunk, and extremities. The head consists of cranium and face. The trunk is divided into vertebral column, thorax, and pelvis. The spine is a column of bones called vertebrae, piled on each other, and united together by fibro-cartilages. It is divided into the regions of neck, back, loins, sacrum, and coccyx, which last, in quadrupeds, is prolonged into a tail. The bones of the chest consist of a sternum and twenty-four ribs, twelve on each side. The sternum

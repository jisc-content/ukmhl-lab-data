OF THE PES EQUINUS. 113 The tarsal bones were all luxated, but not altered in form, there were great intervals between them on the upper surface of the foot. The os calcis was drawn upwards and directed outwards. The tibia reposed on the inferior surface of the astragalus, and the inner ankle was situated above the scaphoid bone. The insertions of the muscles were, of course, altered by the derangements of the bones, but they were not so completely degenerated as in the dis- section of Cruveilheir. All these deformities depend on some incipient interruption irr the process of organization, or on a change in the direction of the feet, during their evolution, at an early period of the foetal life. There is always a tendency in the foot, to turn inwards, which may be observed in children after birth ; a great degree of this, constitutes varus, hence, this variety of club-foot, is the most common. Any pe- culiar impediment may place the foot in an unna- tural position, the bones as they grow become ac- commodated to their new situation, and the articu- lating surfaces are shaped accordingly. Mr. Amesbury’s apparatus for pointed toe, is ap- plicable to most of these cases. I have also figured at the end of the volume, an instrument used bv a %/ celebrated orthopediste of Paris, M. d’lvernois. i

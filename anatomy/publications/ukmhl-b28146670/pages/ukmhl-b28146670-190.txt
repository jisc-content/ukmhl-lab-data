168 OF SPINAL DISTORTIONS FROM of exercise is followed by debility and degeneration of the muscles ; relaxation of ligaments, and soft- ness of bones, are consequences of muscular debi- lity. In persons of a strong, muscular frame, the ligaments are dense, and capable of much resistance: in weakly habits, where the muscles are but little exercised, the ligaments are relaxed, and the fibro- cartilages more pulpy than they should be. The same observation applies to the bones, which are extremely hard, and dense, in very athletic persons, while they are more or less soft and spongy, in those of an opposite character. Such are the mutual re^ lations of the whole fibrous system. The integrity of the entire apparatus of the organs of motion : bone, ligament, and muscle, is dependant upon mus- cular contractility, the degree of this is consequent on exercise, and if the natural relations of these parts are destroyed, deformity ensues. The liga- ments permit all the motions, which the muscles are capable of effecting ; when the latter are irregu- lar in their actions, or when they are defective in power, the ligaments soon yield, in the first instance to muscular contraction, and in the second, to the weight of the superincumbent parts of the body. There are few cases of spinal distortion, which can be exclusively referred to mere weakness ot muscle, or deficiency of irritability: probably in every case of this kind, there is more or less relax- ation of the ligaments, and some loss of consistency

147 OF LATERAL CURVATURE. may occur, but in this instance, instruments have been accused of more than can be fairly laid to their charge. Lateral curvature occurs at all ages, but from very different causes. In the children of weakly and scrophulous parents we see it at the earliest infancy, and when it appears before the age of 10, it is almost invariably the consequence of rickets. From the age of 10 to 16 or 17, this variety of spinal distortion is met with in girls of rapid growth, whose constitu- tions have been weakened by inactivity: these are cases of every day occurrence, the effect of muscular debility. Lateral curvature takes place very fre- quently in girls of the same age, in consequence of a softened, and thickened state, of the fibro-carti- lages, dependant on chronic, or scrophulous inflam- mation. I must refer to those divisions of my work which treat of these specific affections ; we must always bear in mind, that distortions are only the external forms of internal diseases, they are conse- quences of some prior derangement, if we can des- troy the causes, the effects will cease, at least we can never hope to remove the effects while the causes are still in operation. This kind of deformity has been attributed, by many writers, to inequality in the action of the mus- cles of the two sides of the spine; but it is difficult to conceive that this can be the case, inasmuch as we generally find two or more curvatures in opposite l 2

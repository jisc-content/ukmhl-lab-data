OF CONTRACTIONS OF THE G(i SECTION II. OF CONTRACTIONS OF THE WRIST AND FINGERS. This, like club-foot, generally depends on congeni- tal malformation, or unnatural disproportion in the power of the flexor and extensor muscles. The for- mer set overpower the latter, are preternaturally con- tracted, and hold the hand in permanent flexion. The dorsal surface is always convex, the palmar concave. The hand is useless and wastes away. The carpal bones take part in the deformity, when it has been of long-standing. In some cases, the flexion of the hand is accom- panied with continued pronation, or supination. In other cases, the hand does not form a direct line with the fore-arm, but is drawn towards one side, forming an angle: this results from the consolidation of the radius and ulna into one bone, or a total absence of the lower half of the radius. In consequence of this, the carpus has a more narrow base of attachment, the articulating surface is too small, so that the hand will be readily drawn to one side by the action of the muscles. These cases are congenital, and are generally accompanied with irregularity, or malfor- mation, among the carpal bones. The hand and fingers are often contracted by burns, and present many varieties of form. The

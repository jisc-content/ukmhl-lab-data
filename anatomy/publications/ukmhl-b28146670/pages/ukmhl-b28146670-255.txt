Although the principle on which such extensions and manipulations were applied, was erroneous, they might be beneficial in some cases, and the reputation acquired for them, by these instances of success, covered the mischief which must have resulted from their indiscriminate employment in all cases of spi- nal distortion. We may readily conceive the dread- ful consequences, which must have occasionally en- sued, in tearing asunder newly formed anchylosis by these extensions and endeavours to reduce the supposed displacements of the vertebra. During the last century, all spinal distortions were mechanically treated, many complicated and inge- nious instruments were invented for this purpose, and the treatment of these infirmities became almost entirely the province of mechanics.* Various collars, backboards, stays and spine-supporters, were em- ployed, and the great object appeared to be, who should produce the most complicated machine. We * If the fact was not well established, we should doubt the possi- bility of such an occurrence, as that of placing- a deformed person in a kind of napkin-press, and reducing- the distortion by the force of screws. A celebrated case occurred in France, of Madame de Montmoreniji, whose death was occasioned in this manner, and among- the plates ot Le Vacher will be found one representing a girl in a machine of this kind.

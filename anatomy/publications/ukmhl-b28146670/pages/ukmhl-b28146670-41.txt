OF THE MUSCLES. 1!) elastic, and contribute to restore the column alter flexure. The general result of all this admirable construction is, that not only the motions required for the ordinary purposes of life are performed with safety, but that the gesticulations of posture-masters, and the most extraordinary contortions of the body, are exhibited to the admirers of such performances, without any frequent occurrence of accident. Of the muscles. The muscles are the active organs of motion at- tached to the skeleton ; the tendons are cords, pass- ing from muscles, to be fixed to the bones. The muscular fibres derive their contractile energy from the nerves ; for if the branch of a nerve supplying a particular muscle or set of muscles be divided, those muscles lose their power of contractility and become paralysed. Each muscle is made up of fibrillae, which are connected together by cellular membrane, to form fibres ; these are collected into fasciculi, and a congregation of the latter constitutes a muscle. The fibres all contract at the same time, shorten the belly of the muscle, which is at the moment enlarged and hardened. In the contraction of a limb, the whole bulk is less, although the muscles swell: this is proved by the experiment of Glisson, of contracting the muscles of the arm, while in a c 2

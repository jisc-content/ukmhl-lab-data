150 OF LATERAL CURVATURE. muscles are found wasted, pale or yellow, and flac- cid. When the ribs have for many years been placed in close apposition, or ride one over the other, the intercostal muscles will be nearly obliter- ated, this will also be the case with other muscles, which have been totally inactive for many years. In some old cases, the tuberosity, the neck and head of some of the ribs have been found complete- ly anchylosed with the transverse processes, the whole being enveloped in bony matter and con- founded together. The fibro-cartilages are always reduced in thick- ness in the concavity of the curves. Mr. Shaw states that he never found them diseased, but that they always retained their peculiar firmness and elasticity : this is true with regard to lateral curva- tures dependant principally on muscular debility. In cases resulting from the action of scrophula, or chronic inflammation of the intervertebral substance, it will be found softened and distended, its texture infiltrated with a gelatinous fluid, as the analogous structures are found in similar affections of the knee, or other articulations. The influence of this distortion on the animal economy can be readily imagined by considering the anatomy of the parts implicated. The functions of the lungs and heart will suffer according to the degree of the deviation of the parieties of the tho- rax. The large vessels, the thoracic duct, and great

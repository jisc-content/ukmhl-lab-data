OF THE MUSCLES. 21 cates with the point of action by a slender tendon. If the muscles which move the fingers had been placed in the palm, or on the back of the hand, those parts would have been of an awkward and clumsy thickness: their beauty would have been destroyed. They are therefore disposed on the arm, and act by long tendons passing under ligaments at the wrist, to the several joints of the fingers, which they move. In the same manner, the muscles which move the toes, and many of the joints of the foot, are gracefully disposed in the calf of the leg, instead of forming an unwieldy bulk in the foot itself. Each set of muscles, has generally an antagonist set, having an opposite action ; as the flexors and extensors, adductors, and abductors. The extensors are not weaker than the flexors, but these latter, act under more favorable conditions, than the former. The flexors increase in power as their action con- tinues : they are in the most unfavourable condition for power at the beginning of their action ; their fibres being parallel to the bone which is to be moved, in the course of action they gradually be- come oblique, and at last form the most favourable angle for action. The reverse is the case with the extensors ; these being in the most favourable con- dition for power at the beginning of action. The preponderance of the flexors is greatest in the foetus, and continues after birth : in mature age there is more equality ot power, and again, in advanced life.

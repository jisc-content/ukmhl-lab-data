PREFACE. Vll. to physical, will interfere with mental im- provement: on the contrary, if the body is sound, the mind will more readily receive good impressions, than under opposite cir- cumstances. The instances which occur of powerful and intelligent minds, connected with feeble and debilitated corporeal frames, are but exceptions to the general rule. For a corroboration of this opinion we need only refer to the patriots and philosophers of Athens and Rome, who were at least equal in intellectual capacity, to the less vigorous denizens of any modern state. The following is a list of the principal works on the subject of Deformities; to many of which I am indebted for hints and extracts. Andry tie l’Orthopedie, 1741. Le Vacher de la Feutrie, Traite du Rakitis, on l’Art de Redresser les Enfans Contrefait, 1772- Pott’s Works, Vol. 3. Petit Maladies des Os. Portal, Observations sur la Rachitisme.

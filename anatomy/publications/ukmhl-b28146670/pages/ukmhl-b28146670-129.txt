TREATMENT OF VARUS. 107 ternal margin of the foot to remain, as it were suspended, on the ground ; 3d, as soon as the equi- librium of the muscles of the leg is restored, to pro- mote by means of the combined action of the two classes of muscles, the flexion of the foot on the tibia, so that as soon as the great tension of the tendo achillis, and gastrocnemii, is overcome, the posterior tuberosity of the os calcis may be depress- ed, and brought into its proper direction with the sole, that the foot may acquire the aptitude of per- forming the motions of flexion and extension. The artificial force should at first be very mode- rate, and be gradually increased, but must never prevent walking. A gradual force will effect an elongation of muscles and ligaments without dan- ger, when sudden straining and violent compression, far from producing relaxation and elongation, will have quite an opposite effect, and occasion retrac- tion, rigidity, and spasm. There are two stages in the cure of the disease, and there are two parts of the apparatus of Scarpa, respectively adapted to the two stages : the first, for turning the toot, from within outwards, to bring it into a proper direction with the tibia: the se- cond, for correcting the direction of the heel, and retaining the tibia and fibula perpendicular to the astragalus. These objects are to be effected by a horizontal and a vertical spring, the actions of which will be understood by referring to the figure, and

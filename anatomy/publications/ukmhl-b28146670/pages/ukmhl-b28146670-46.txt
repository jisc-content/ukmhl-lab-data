24 OF THE MUSCLES. contracts at the bidding of the will, or on the appli- cation of a stimulus, either directly or through the medium of the nerves. The heart may be made to contract some time after death on the application of a stimulus ; if a scalpel be thrust into the mus- cles of a recently amputated limb, it will contract violently. This irritability is more permanent in those animals, where, during life it is less vivid, as in the cold blooded classes ; the heart of the tortoise may be made to contract thirty or forty hours after death, while in the warm-blooded all contractility has fled at a much earlier period. Irritability or contractility, is very distinct from elasticity, which the muscular possesses in common with other tissues, and also from that tendency which all organized parts have to continual contrac- tion, when free from their natural connexions. Ir- ritability is not continual; it is exhausted by action, and requires repose for its regeneration. The most characteristic feature of the locomotive organs of man, is his erect posture ; this position gives the most exhaltcd situation to his noblest or- gan, the brain. The erect position of the human body, is the cause of the great size and rounded form by which the muscles of the buttock, thigh and leg, are distinguished from the corresponding muscles in other animals. The breadth of the feet and the distance to which they may be separated, is sufficient for the centre

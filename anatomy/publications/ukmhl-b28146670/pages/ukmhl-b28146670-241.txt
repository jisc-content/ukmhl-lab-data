219 DISEASE OF THE BONES. mation, and exasperating the disease. We may congratulate ourselves on the more advanced state of surgery in our own time, which affords us the gratification ol being enabled to check the piogiess of a malady, that renders an individual, beyond all others, a misery to himself, and a pitiable spectacle of human infirmity to his friends. It is the melan- choly fate of this affection, that though it rarely kills, it produces results perhaps more to be lamented, than loss of life, for it often leads its victims to struggle with long-continued disease, and even it they do recover their health, it is not before they are rendered unfit for many ot the active duties of life. It seems reasonable to suppose that all diseases of the bones, are seated in the cellular, vascular, or medullary tissue lining the cells or reticulated struc- ture, and not in the osseous matter itself. These tissues, when inflamed, sometimes furnish pus in abundance, hence abscesses: when the pus is less abundant it may be entirely removed by absorption. The cells of the bony tissue will be distended by the inflammation of their lining membrane, and, by its subsequent disorganization, may be deprived of their materials of nutrition : this will explain the total disappearance of bony substance, without ulceration, and also how in some cases, the vertebras will be crushed by the superincumbent weight, and sudden curvature sometimes produced. The necessity of an undeviating horizontal position, is absolutely re-

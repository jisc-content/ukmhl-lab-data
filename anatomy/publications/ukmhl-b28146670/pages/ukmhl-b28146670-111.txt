89 OP THE KNEE-JOINT. cular system. However, in bad cases, we must have recourse to instrumental aid. The machines used for the correction of these de- formities are well known, they consist of steel splints with joints and springs. Great care should be taken that the joints correspond accurately with the articu- lations of the limb, and the bandage round the pelvis should be particularly attended to. The joint of the instrument corresponding to the knee should be rendered inflexible in the early part of the treatment, for it is advisable to prevent the motion of the arti- culation, until the ligaments have contracted to their natural length. The irksomeness of the machine is always considerable at first, but even children soon become accustomed to the inconvenience, and return to their usual amusements without feeling any ma- terial incumbrance. After some time the instru- ment may be altered so as to allow motion to the knee-joint, and an ultimate and effectual cure will in the majority of instances result, if the treatment is endured with a fair degree of patience. The employment of springs, on a similar principle to those, described and figured in the last chapter, for club-foot, are equally applicable to deformities of the knee, and the elasticity of their action, renders them more beneficial than the unyielding instru- ments in common use.

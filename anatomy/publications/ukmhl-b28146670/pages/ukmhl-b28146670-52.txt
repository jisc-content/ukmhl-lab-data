( 30 ) CHAPTER I. General Observations on Deformities. In the preceding introduction, I have spoken of the connexion of bones, by means of ligaments and mus- cles, considering these last of almost as much im- portance as the former, in retaining the bones in their respective situations. The ligaments are so arranged, that they permit the motion of a joint in every direction, that the muscles are calculated to effect; and a due reciprocity of action, between an- tagonist muscles, is necessary to maintain the bones in their natural positions. Therefore, when the flexors or extensors of a limb, or the principal of them, are deficient in length, in power, or in vigour, their opponents, being uncontrolled, will induce dis- tortion. The due action of muscles, and their con- sequent vigour, strengthens the ligamentous con- nexions of the bones, and even tends to harden the bone itself; in strong athletic individuals, the liga- ments are of greater tenacity, and the bones of greater hardness, than in persons of a lax muscular fibre. In the amputation of limbs, where disease has been long established, the bone is always softer, and more ea-

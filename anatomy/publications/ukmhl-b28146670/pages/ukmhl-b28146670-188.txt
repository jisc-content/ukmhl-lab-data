OF CUUVATUBK BACKWARDS. 166 of the loins are sometimes produced, by carrying heavy weights on the head. They are occasionally connected with lumbar abcess. The differences in the anatomical structure of the anterior and posterior portions of the vertebra, suffi- ciently account for the infrequency of curvature backwards, compared with curvature forwards. In their healthy condition, the intervertebral substances readily yield to compression, and allow motion of the spine forwards to a very much greater extent, than the oblique and spinous processes permit in the opposite direction.

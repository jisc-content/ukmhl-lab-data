DEFECTIVE MUSCULAR ACTION. 173 faulty digestion, or some of the other processes con- cerned in the formation of the nutritive particles,) and that the minute arteries deposit the matter, so contained in the blood, sometimes in a part already predisposed to a peculiar form of disease, as the breast with respect to cancer, or the lungs to tuber- cles, and at other times in tissues of a totally different nature. As inactivity leads to distortions by destroying the power and energy of the muscles, so inordinate exercise will produce a degree of muscular develop- ment which almost amounts to deformity. This is seen in the disproportionate size of the legs of opera- dancers and the arms of blacksmiths. The influence of the muscles in maintaining the proper position of the articulating surfaces, is exemplified in the elongation of the ligaments of posture-masters, rope- dancers &c. whose occupations lead them, from an early age, to distort their limbs and trunks in a most extraordinary manner: for example, to hang their legs on their shoulders and walk upon their hands, the difficulty of which will be seen by trying to do it on the skeleton. The ligaments are, in these people, greatly stretched, and the connexion of the bones must mainly depend on the power and correct action of the muscles. However, such is the tendency of parts to return to their natural conditions, that the ligaments will soon contract to their proper dimen- sions, whenever the extraordinary action of the mus-

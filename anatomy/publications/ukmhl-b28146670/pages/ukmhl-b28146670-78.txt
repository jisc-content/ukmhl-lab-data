There cannot be ima- gined human beings more sunk in vice and misery, than may be witnessed in some of the more crowded spots of our boasted manufactures. Such depravity and such wretchedness, cannot be surpassed among the wildest savages. The early symptoms of the disease, have been pointed out in the course of the preceding observa- tions. The curvature of the spine, in rickets, is com- monly forwards, but in many instances, there is late- ral deviation.

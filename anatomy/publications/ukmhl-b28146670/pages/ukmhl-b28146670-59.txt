ON DEFORMITIES. 37 direction in order to maintain the equilibrium, and a great suecussion occurs at each step. However, in such cases it is very long before the deformity becomes permanent, for when the body is placed in a horizontal position, the lateral curve of the spine is effaced, and the shortness of the limb is alone ap- parent. In congenital malformation of the hip-joint, where the pelvis is inclined forwards, and the lumbar re- gion backwards, progression is effected by a series of falls, from one lower extremity to the other; there may be a lameness on both sides, and although such a state of things shall have existed from the earliest infancy, no permanent deformity of the spine results. In the recumbent position the curve of the lumbar region is effaced, and when a certain degree of cur- vature is established by the entire development of growth, it remains in the same state for life. No fact can be better established, than the effect of peculiar attitudes on the form of persons engaged in different occupations. Who cannot tell a tailor by his gait ? shoemakers, clerks, &c. have their per- sons more or less affected by their peculiar attitudes, more especially when such sedentary occupations have been imposed, before the growth of the body is complete. Artists are also liable to lateral cur- vature of the spine from this cause. But when we consider the number of persons, whose occupation leads them to continued work in particular positions.

182 OF SPINAL DISTORTION FROM in all the cases, nearly similar, viz : to give tone and power to the muscular system generally, and to the particularly defective muscles locally. This is to be effected principally by exercise. It is of the utmost importance, that a correct di- agnosis be formed, because, the mode of treatment is essentially different in this, and the two classes of spinal distortions, described in the following chap- ters. Nothing, for example, could be more unwise, than to prescribe perfect repose, in a class of dis- eases which are dependant on imperfect muscular action : from carelessness in tracing effects to their causes, and from the system of prescribing for symp- toms, this has been done, and I know individuals who have been condemned to a recumbent position, for months and years, whose cases required to be met with various modifications of exercise. In slight cases of spinal deviation, from mere muscu- lar inactivity, perseverance in a course of exercise^ adapted to bring the muscles of the spine into re- gular action, should be rigidly enforced, not only to restore the vertebrae to their true position, but after this has been accomplished, to maintain them so. Much has been said, and much has been written on the subject of exercises, adapted to bring into play the muscles of the spine, to expand the chest, &c. ; many of those which have been recommended are good, but perhaps not superior to some of the old English games, which in former times, young

DISEASE OF THE FIBRO-CARTILAGES. 209 to another, from these to quacks and nostrum-ven- ders, untd life is cut short, perhaps as much by the multifarious remedies employed, as by the disease; under a more simple mode of treatment, with quie- tude and regularity of living, the malady, if not cured, might be kept at bay, and a sufficient degree of health established for the enjoyment of many years’ existence. Health is too often not valued for itself, but as a state which permits indulgence, and sensual enjoyment, and as the greater part of mankind sel- dom think for themselves, they are always ready to listen to any one who pretends to possess a secret, by which disease may be speedily removed. But to return to the treatment of this peculiar affection of the fibro-cartilages : after the repetition of several small bleedings, by cupping or leeches, a small blister should be applied on each side of the principal focus of the malady, and be kept open, or repeated, according to circumstances. Conjoined with the local treatment, we must pay due attention to the general health : the digestive organs, will be benefited by mild aperients, and alteratives: small doses of hydrargyri cum creta, with rhubarb, to chil- dren—pilula hydr. and rhubarb: decoct, aloes comp, to adults, will be useful medicines for such purposes. These and other medical means, to improve the ac- tion of the various functions, will be required, but our chief dependance for the restoration of health must be on a well-regulated system of diet and regimen.

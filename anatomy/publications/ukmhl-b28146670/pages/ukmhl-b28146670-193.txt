DEFECTIVE MUSCULAR ACTION. 171 will be the means of preventing many deformities, and physical education may now' be said, properly to share with mental. Happiness should be the end of every system of education ; but, however beautiful may be the precepts, however excellent the principles inculcated, however highly the mind may be adorned, without health, these excellencies cannot be enjoyed. We too often witness minds endowed with almost every human perfection, strug- gling through life tied to a crazy constitution, the consequence of the greater attention paid to the mental capacity, than to the physical frame. It is well known that muscles which are not called into action, lose their character, and after some time, suffer almost entire annihilation. It has been as- serted that inactive muscles degenerate into cellular tissue, and that the latter is not merely the original tissue in which bone, muscle, &c. are deposited, but even that from which all other parts maybe formed. The fact appears to be, that in the process of ab- sorption, the fibrous parts of inactive muscles are removed, and the arteries do not deposit new ones, because they are not required, so that after some time, little remains in the place of such muscles but fat and cellular tissue. Such is the wonderful regu- larity with which the laws of Nature arc carried on, that the secretions of a part arc always accommodated to the wants of apart. In unreduced dislocations of the hip and other articulations, Nature attempts the

These cases of par- tial paralysis are removed by gentle aperient altera- tives, cold bathing, friction, and exercise. SECTION II.- DEFORMITIES FROM MALFORMATION OF THE HIP- JOINT. There are various congenital malformations about the hip-joint, which have been described by Palleta, and more recently by M. Dupuytren; but the sub- ject is still obscure from the very few opportunities of anatomical inspection, which have been taken advantage of. Deformities, until very recently, have been so entirely left to the care of mere mechanics, that this branch of surgery has been but partially investigated. In the cases, which we are about to consider, there is a want of conformity between the head of the fe- mur, and the acetabulum : the former is forced up- wards, into the external iliac fossa, the latter is much altered in form, or. nearly obliterated.

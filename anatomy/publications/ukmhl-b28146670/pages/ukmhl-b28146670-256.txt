ON THU MECHANICAL APPARATUS •231 have had occasion to dwell on the mischief which must result from the use of instruments to fulfil the office of the spinal muscles, which necessarily lose their powers, when their action is superseded or pre- vented by such means. The ill consequences of the mechanical treatment of deformities of the spine, frequently presented themselves. Slight distortions were rendered wdrse, and bad ones were not mended, and on the recom- mendation of Mr. Baynton it became the fashion to condemn all persons, who either had, or were threatened with spinal deformity, to an undeviating horizontal posture for months and years. This is excellent practice in many cases of diseased bone and cartilage, but in debilitated states of the muscu- lar system, the evil will be increased by such total inaction. Frequent failures threw this system and the inclined plane, which was a modification of it, out of fashion. From the universal application of machinery, and of the recumbent position, we arc now in danger of % running into the opposite extreme,—of neglecting mechanical means and repose, and trusting too much to muscular exercise, gymnastics and callisthenics, which are not only to prevent, but to cure all varie- ties of spinal deformity. All the means which have been enumerated are beneficial when applied to the proper cases. Various exercises in muscular debility, and in convalescence

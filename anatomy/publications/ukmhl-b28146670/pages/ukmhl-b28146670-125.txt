103 OF VARUS. complete. In very bad cases, the weight of the body falls on this head of the astragalus, which takes the place of the tuberosity of the os calcis, or the heel. The os calcis follows the astragalus in its dis- placement, and only rests on the ground, by its external margin : its posterior extremity is deformed and diminished in volume, and brought nearer to the internal ankle than natural. The anterior sur- face of this bone is not in apposition with the cor- responding surface of the cuboides, hence the pro- jection formed by the anterior tuberosity of the calcis under the Skin, on which the foot sometimes rests , in walking instead of the posterior extremity. When this part suffers pressure, the skin over it becomes callous, and a bursa becomes organised between the latter and the bone: the same circumstance occurs when the astragalus bears on the ground, and some- times a cartilage is formed in the part subjected to pressure. Thus Nature accommodates herself to the morbid condition of a part, by the application of the same laws, which govern her operations in a state of health. Among the descriptions which we have of the osteology ot this deformity, there are no two which agree. Such is the great variety of club-feet, that in no two cases are the same bones equally displaced. At birth, the bones of the tarsus are so unformed, that they may be moulded to any shape, and many

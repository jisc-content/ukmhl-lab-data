OF LATERAL CURVATURE. 143 carried towards the right side, and thus we have the right shoulder raised. As this position becomes fixed, and that it often does very rapidly, from the rapidity of growth at this period of life, the ribs of the left side are crowded together, while those of the right side are more than commonly separated : the consequence is fulness on the right and depression on the left side of the chest. A third curvature, often very slight, takes place in the cervical region, in order to bring the head perpendicular to the centre of gravity. Independent of these lateral curves, the vertebral column is generally more or less twisted, or rotated, on its axis; by which the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae, are thrust forwards on the left side, while those on the right are entirely concealed. The sacro-lumbalis, and longissimus dorsi muscles, form a protuberance on the left, and are drawn in- wards on the right, leaving a degree of concavity. In the dorsal region the transverse processes of the right side will be thrust outwards. The lumbar de- viations form the first stage of the malady, but this seldom meets our eye, for, as I before observed, at- tention is not called to these early symptoms, being only awakened by the appearance of deformity in the back and shoulder. However, it often happens, that more than one cause operates at the same time, in the production of spinal distortion ; when the fibro-cartilages are greatly relaxed, a deviation will

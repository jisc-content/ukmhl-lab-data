70 OF INEQUALITY IN THE clination of the pelvis, and curvature of the lumbar region, while on foot, but which disappear in the recumbent position. A second curvature takes place in the dorsal region of the spine, to maintain the equilibrium of the body : every step the child takes, the vertebral column is thrown into a serpentine form, and the shoulder of the opposite side to the short limb, will he much elevated. These distor- tions, are at first only apparent in standing, or in progression, in the sitting posture the spinal devia- tions are obliterated, and it is very long before they become fixed and permanent. A correct eye will, in a moment, perceive the un- equal development of the two sides of the body. The different length of the lower limbs, may be correctly estimated, by measuring the difference of extent, between the great trochanter and external ankle, of the two sides; or by raising the head, so as to remove the curves of the spine, and bringing the pelvis perfectly horizontal, the difference may be precisely found, by placing something under the foot of the diminutive side. Inequality in-the length of the lower extremities, whether congenital, or resulting from some disease in early life, which has disturbed the reciprocal de- velopment of the limbs, is not only a deformity in itself, but is mischievous by the consequent distor- tions, that inevitably attend it. We should therefore attempt to remedy it at an early period, before any

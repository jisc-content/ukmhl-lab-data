OF LATERAL CURVATURE. 149 any serious curvature, must be seconded by othei causes. Growing boys indulge in peculiar positions as well as girls, yet how comparatively free are they from deformity. The plain state of the case is, that we are instinctively directed to relieve the back, by placing it in a waving direction, first on one side and then on the other, as horses rest alter- nately their hind legs; so long as the frame is in health, no evil can arise from such natural indul- gence, but where the muscles of the back are weak, or where there is a scrophulous disposition, the li- gaments will be lax, and the intervertebral carti- lages less dense than they should be, and it is from such combinations of causes, that these distortions commonly arise. Anatomical investigations have ascertained that the bones are seldom diseased in lateral curvature. In those cases which originate in very early life, they are usually soft and spongy, and lose their shape by pressure, but in the most frequent instances of this variety of curvature, we may consider it as established, that the bones are never altered in structure, nor is their figure changed but in old, and permanent deformities. The muscles, and liga- ments, are found considerably altered both in form and texture : they are stretched and elongated on the convexity of the curves, while on the opposite sides they are contracted, as is also the skin. When the deformity has been of long continuance, the

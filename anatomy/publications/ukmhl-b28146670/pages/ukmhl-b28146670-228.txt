OF spinal distortion from 20G cartilages is considerable, that the reciprocal sepa- ration of the vertebrae is great, although it may not amount to the extent of admitting a sensible motion amongst them. If it be judged advisable to use either manual, or mechanical extension of the spine, it must be carefully practised, because great effects are pro- duced in these cases, with little power, in a compa- ratively short time. It is obvious, that if the relaxa- tion of the cartilages, is so great as to allow any de- gree of horizontal motion, between the vertebrae, we must not think of extending the spine, or of using any mechanical means capable of producing altera- tion in its form : it is desirable, before having re- course to such measures, that the diseased action of the fibro-cartilages be subdued, and that the articu- lations should have acquired more solidity. Treatment. This disease does not amount to acute inflammation, but is characterised by an increase in size, of the vessels, and an infiltration into the tis- sue of the cartilages, a condition which probably constitutes what we term sub-acute, or chronic in- flammation. This state is succeeded by slow ulcer- ation or absorption, not only of the structure of the fibro-cartilages, but ultimately of the bones ; such a state of things is always to be feared, and is to be prevented by repose, local abstraction of blood, alterative aperients, and counter-irritation.

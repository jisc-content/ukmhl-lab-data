OF SPINAL DISTORTION FROM 204 Diagnosis.â€”Careful investigation will readily en- able us to distinguish deformities from disease of the fibro-cartilages, from those originating in defective muscular action. The weary pain sometimes com- plained of in distortions from muscular debility, is relieved by exercises, which would increase pain that was dependant on chronic inflammation of the in- tervertebral substance: the pain in the former cases is never so great as in the latter, nor is it ever in- duced in the first by pressure on the spinous pro- cesses, or by the application of a hot sponge. In deformity from muscular debility, the primary dis- tortion is in the lumbar region, which forms a gentle curve to the left, followed by a deviation of the whole dorsal region, in the opposite direction, pro- ducing elevation of the right shoulder ; the curves are more regular, and implicate a greater number of vertebrae than in deformities from alteration of the fibro-cartilages, in which the primary deviation is rather a projection backwards, of one or more spi- nous processes in the dorsal region, complicated with some degree of lateral curvature, but the curves are smaller, less regular, and more numerous than in the former. The health is more impaired in these cases, than in those described in the preceding chapter, the constitution often exhibits marks of scrophula: the patients are generally dyspeptic and febrile, bad sleepers, complain of a sense of constriction at the

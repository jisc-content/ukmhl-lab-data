224 OF SPINAL DISTORTION FROM the success of so important a process, is repose: every* motion will obstruct the union of the new osseous plates or columns, with the two limits of the devasta- tion. In this point of view, the dorsal region is the most favourable, in which the disease can occur, be- cause the ribs render this part of the spine, the least moveable. The cervical region presents many un- favourable circumstances: here arc no surrounding bones which can support the diseased vertebrae : the surfaces of the bodies are of small extent: nu- merous and powerful muscles produce, in this part, extensive mobility. Patients afflicted with the dis- ease in this situation, commonly support the head by one or both hands placed under the chin; this attitude is so constant that it becomes an essential symptom of the malady, and an indication of its situation. With respect to the diagnosis, to avoid repetition, I shall refer to the observations, in the preceding chapter, which arc equally applicable to the sub- ject of this. The early symptoms of this disease, are so very similar to those of inflammation of the fibro-cartilagcs, that it is almost impossible to dis- tinguish the incipient stages of these two maladies. Fortunately the mode of treatment is equally proper in each of these diseases, and it is only important to distinguish them from the more simple results of defective muscular action. Cases have occurred, where the spine has been forcibly extended, when

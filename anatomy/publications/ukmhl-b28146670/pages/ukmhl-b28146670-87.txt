65 OF CONTRACTIONS OF THE ELBOW. cording to the degree of shortening in the muscle, or its tendon. When an attempt is made to extend the forearm, the tendon becomes more firm, and resists the motion. The brachilis intern us will con- tribute to keep the arm in a state of flexion. The antagonist muscle, the triceps, will of course be in a state of inactivity. %! The use of the upper extremity is much limited, and the consequent want of exercise, still farther increases the evil, by causing atrophy of the muscles, as in all other cases, where they are not called into action. Having determined that no active mischief is going on in the joint, and that there is no true anchylosis, we must have recourse to gradual and remitting exten- sion, shampooing, friction, the local application of vapour: by uninterrupted perseverance in these means we shall always succeed in overcoming mus- cular contractions, if the mischief has not been of very long standing, and the ligaments have not had time to acquire a very unnatural degree of density and rigidity. If there is any motion in the joint, we may confidently prognosticate the ultimate restora- tion of its utility. No better instrument can be used in these cases, than that of Mr. Amesbury, for stiff elbow-joint : the power of the screw will overcome any resistance, and when employed with prudence, and sufficient perseverance, there are few cases in which it will not be beneficial.

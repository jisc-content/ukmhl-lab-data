216 OF SPINAL DISTORTION FROM spine should be carefully examined. So low is the degree of sensibility, in bone and cartilage, in health, and even in early inflammation of these parts, that the smallest degree of tenderness to the touch is evidence of morbid action. But even this sometimes fails to point out the seat of the malady, when we may have recourse to the expedient of carrying a hot sponge down the spine, which will often pro- duce a very acute degree of pain, while passing over the part where disease is going on. Mr. Copeland very justly observes, that although the absence of pain on the application of heat, is not a certain evi- dence of the absence of disease, the feeling of acute sensation in any one part, is sufficient to mark the seat of mischief. Whatever circumstance, however trifling, leads to an accurate diagnosis of this for- midable complaint, cannot be too much insisted on, at the only period when it is in our power to prevent the deformity, and other serious effects which are usually consequent on a continuance of this disease. The condition of the lower extremities in para- lysis from this affection of the spine differs from that of common palsy : the muscles have not the flabby feel of a truly paralytic limb: there is not that loose- ness of the joints, nor that total incapacity of resist- ance, which allows the latter to be twisted in all directions; on the contrary, there is commonly rigidity of the joints, especially the ankles.

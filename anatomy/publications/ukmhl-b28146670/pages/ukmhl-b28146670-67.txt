ON RICKETS. 45 have been found reduced to a mere shell, the exter- nal appearance presenting but little difference from their natural state, while the interior was one vast cavern, divided by some irregular cells, the consis- tence of which were very soft. The scorbutic cases he describes, are but peculiar varieties of scrophula, The opinions of Portal are sometimes rather far- fetched, for he mentions a variety of rickets, which he attributes to the operation of castration. In children predisposed to rickets there is at an early age great deficiency of nutrition; the functions of the digestive apparatus are frequently deranged, while the appetite is often voracious : flatulence, ir- regularity of bowels, sometimes confined, often re- laxed ; tumid abdomen, retarded dentition, laxity of fibre, and general emaciation. With all these symptoms the countenance is often lively, the eyes bright, and the intellect precocious. This preco- city of intellect, is not to be altogether attributed to the circumstances in which the child is placed, but is a characteristic feature of the disease. The vo- lume of the brain is proportionally larger than in other children, and the organs of sense, particularly rent swelling- cannot alone be referred to the emaciation of the soft parts of the limb. In the skeleton of a child of 10 years of ag-e, preserved in the Museum of the London University, the bones of the cranium are remarkably thickened, in some parts nearly to the extent of an inch, and have the characteristic softness of rickety bones.

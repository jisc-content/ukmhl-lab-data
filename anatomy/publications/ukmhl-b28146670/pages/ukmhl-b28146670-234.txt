( 212 ) CHAPTER XI. Of Disease of the V?rtebrce, as a Cause of Spinal Distortion. In this disease there is an approximation of the upper, to the lower part of the spine, in consequence of softness, gradual absorption, or caries of the verte- brae, The bodies of these bones, are either too soft, to bear the weight of the upper part of the body, which crushes them, and causes their absorption; or they are destroyed by ulceration, and the upper extremity of the diseased portion of the spine, is brought into juxta-position with the lower. In this manner a hump is produced posteriorly, varying in size and shape according* to the degree of destruction of the bodies of the vertebrae, and the number of these bones implicated in the malady. In some cases, the disease will be arrested, when only a superficial layer of the anterior part of the bodies of several vertebrae shall be removed, under which circumstance there will be little or no distortion of the spine, or only a very slight curvature forwards : in other cases, the whole of the bodies of one or more vertebrae, are totally destroyed when the spine

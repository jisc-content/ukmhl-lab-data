OF VARUS. h 2 09 the particular tarsal bones, which arc principally implicated in the distortion ; the fact is, that there is much difference in this respect. In some in- stances, the astragalus, in others, the naviculare, are most displaced; but the four first bones, the calcis, the astragalus, the scaphoides, and the cuboi- des, are those which alone suffer displacement, in the majority of cases ; but they are never entirely re- moved from their respective cavities. The essence of the deformity, consists in the twisting of these bones around their smaller axis, the consequence of which is, that the cuneiform, the metatarsal bones, and those of the phalanges, are drawn into the same direction, and the toes instead of being horizontal, are placed in a vertical position. The effect of this alteration among the bones, is that some of the muscles are shortened and some elongated: among the former are the tibiales, the flexor longus, the soleus and gastrocnemius, among the latter are the peronei muscles. The ligaments, which unite the tarsal bones together, and to the tibia and fibula, are found in a state of unequal tension, some being extremely rigid, while others are attenuated. The following description of the anatomy of a case of varus, is from Cruveilheirâ€™s Anatomie Patho- logique. The subject was a woman of 41, the foot was deformed from infancy, and her situation in life obliged her to walk much daily.

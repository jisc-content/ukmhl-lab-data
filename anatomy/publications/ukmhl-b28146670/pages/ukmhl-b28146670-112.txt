90 CONTRACTIONS OF THE KNEE. CONTRACTIONS OF THE KNEE. Of all contractions, that of the knee-joint is one of the most frequent. In this affection, the thigh and leg, no longer maintain the same line, but pre- sent posteriorly an angle, more or less open. The extension of the leg is impeded, and progression is rendered impossible. It is hardly necessary to state, that the bones do not originally participate in this contraction, although in long-continued cases, they become fixed by a true anchylosis. The muscles and ligaments are first implicated, in these affections. The biceps, semitendinosus, and semimembranosus, are principally concerned, their tendons being gene- rally shortened, and so tense, as to render extension impossible. This contraction is induced by various causes, among which may be mentioned, long-conti- nued flexion of the leg, in maladies of much dura- tion : prolonged progression on the toes from wounds on the sole of the foot, and other causes, which re- tain the knees continually bent. This contraction also results from cicatrices of burns, or other wounds. Where there exists a contraction of the thigh on the pelvis, we have more or less contraction at the knee. In old cases, from whatever cause, the articulating surfaces undergo an insensible alteration, so that when the impediment formed by the muscles is removed, the joint cannot be bent. This arises from

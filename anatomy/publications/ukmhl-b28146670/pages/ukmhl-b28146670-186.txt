164 OF ANGULAR FROJECTION. exciting cause, which brings into activity, latent mischief. Patients suffering under this form of distortion, arc debilitated, and incapable of much exertion, they cannot hold themselves erect long, without support: the act of walking is imperfectly performed, the gait is waddling, or the legs cross, and the patient is thrown down. Persons thus deformed often seek support by placing both hands above their knees, and they avail themselves of any accidental assis- tance that falls in their way. When the vertebra?, fibro-cartilages, and ligaments, are much diseased, patients instinctively seek to remove all pressure from the bodies of the vertebra?, by lying down in the horizontal position, or by placing themselves on their knees and elbows. The spinal canal in angular projection always maintains its continuity. When the fibro-cartilages between the carious vertebrae, and the bodies of one or more of these bones have been removed by ulcer- ative absorption, when their posterior surfaces are destroyed, the canal is laid open, and the medullary membranes, are exposed not only to mechanical pressure, but to the irritation of purulent matter: those dreadful consequences ensue, which are fully detailed in Chap. XI.

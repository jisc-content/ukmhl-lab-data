GENERAL OBSERVATIONS 38 the proportion of deformities among them, is far from being so great as might be expected ; indeed the majority of deformed persons are of no occupa- tion at all, which is perhaps one cause of their in- firmity. In the greater number of lateral curvatures, the right shoulder is more elevated than the left, and the inclination of the dorsal vertebrae is towards the right side ; some writers on this subject suppose the cause to be in the more frequent employment of the right arm ; this opinion has been disputed by others, who have not scrupled to place some cases of distortion to the account of attitude in clerks, artists, &c. which very peculiarity of attitude, consists in the more con- stant use of the right side of the body. Attitude must be allowed to have some influence in the production of deformities, but perhaps too much has been attributed to it; the fact appears to be, that it only operates in those individuals whose fibrous textures are lax, or in those who have a stru- mous taint. Some cases of deformity arise from congenital in- equality of the two sides of the body. The muscles, and in some instances the bones, are less developed on one side of the body than on the other. There is perhaps no notion more pernicious, than the supposition that children will outgrow deformi- ties. That a deformity will often stop at a certain point, and as the body grows will be less apparent

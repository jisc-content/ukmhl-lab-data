GENERAL OBSERVATIONS 40 deformity. Many are congenital, as club-foot, mal- formation of the hip-joint, inequality of length of legs, &c. Some occur very early in life, in conse- quence of scrophula or rickets ; others are most fre- quent from the ages of 8 or 10 to 16 or 18, as those which result from muscular debility, and chronic inflammation of the intervertebral cartilages ; while those consequent on disease of the bones, and rheu- matism, affect persons of all ages. With regard to the period of life, to which a pos- sibility of curing deformity extends, there will of course be great difference according to the cases. The earlier the stage, in which curative means are applied, the better ; but it may be established as a general rule, that, during the period of growth, most distortions, that are at all curable, may be entirely removed. So long is it before any marked effect is produced on the form of the bones, in many varieties of club-feet, that these distortions may be entirely effaced, at almost any period before growth ceases. Even after the period of youth, they may be much benefited, and sometimes altogether removed. The same observations apply to many varieties of dis- torted spine. To be able to give a fair prognostic, we must be very careful in distinguishing the true nature of the cause, and the degree to which it has operated on the limbs or spine. In inflammation of f.he fibro-cartilages, for example, if the disease has

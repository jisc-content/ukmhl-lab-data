or SPINAL DISTORTION FROM 222 caries of the bones in the hip and other joints, the same occurs in the spine, and some cases of diseased bone arc secondary. The analogy is even upheld by the success of the same kind of treatment, caustic issues, in both diseases. In the articular cartilages, Mr. Brodie states that ulceration may go on for a considerable time without suppuration, and it is in this stage of the disease that timely measures will prevent abscess or caries. In some cases, caries occurs in consequence of simple chronic inflammation of the bodies of the vertebrae, and differs from that morbid condition which constitutes the true scrophulous affection of the bones. These must again be distinguished from cases arising from long-continued pressure of an abscess, which had originated in the neighbouring soft parts, or of an aneurism, or other tumor; in these, we find the fibro-cartilages, little or not at all affected, so that they are left projecting nearly, if not quite of their natural size, while the bones are in a great measure consumed. The cancellous structure of all the lumbar and dorsal vertebrae, has been found ot a dark red colour, and so soft that it might be easily cut with a com- mon scalpel, or crushed under the pressure of the fingers. Delpech considers that the disease first described by Mr. Pott, and known by his name, depends on a tuberculated state of the hones, having in nume-

229 DISEASE OF THE BONES. remove any degree of the deformity. When anchy- losis has already taken place, no amendment can be expected, but where this process is going on, constant repose will not only favour its progress, but position may also modify the deposition of ossific matter, so as to produce but little comparative de- formity. Anchylosis takes place early in young subjects, but is a very tedious process in more advanced life. However long the diseased surfaces of the vertebrte, may take to consolidate, we may always expect con- fidently that it will at length be accomplished, if no abscess has occurred. It is only in neglected, and very advanced states of the disease, that we are con- demned to witness that wretched condition, which entirely deprives the unfortunate sufferer of the use of his lower limbs, and places him beyond the reach of all the powers of art. In speaking of the utility of moxas in this disease, I might remark that, in discarding the actual cau- tery, English surgeons have abandoned a most effi- cacious remedy, and many are equally prejudiced against the employment of the moxa. From per- sonal experience, I can assert, that the pain produced by this remedy is not greater than that of a blister, nor so great as that of a mustard cataplasm, and, were it again necessary, I would more willingly have a moxa burnt on my skin, than apply a blister to it.

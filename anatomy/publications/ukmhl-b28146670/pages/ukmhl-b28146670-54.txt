GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ;s-2 much rapidity, will, during an attack of the exan- themata, or other disease, shoot up some inches ; as if the morbid state had effected some alteration in the functions of nutrition, with respect to the osseous system. In such cases muscular debility is often extreme, and it is very common for parents to date a distortion of the spine, to the period of such dis- order. The correctness and solidity of the relations of the bones among themselves, are in such close de- pendance on muscular action, that these relations will be disturbed, if the muscles are diminished in energy. The same causes which operate in the production of muscular debility, extend their influence to the ligaments. It has been before observed, that the connexions of bones, in most of the articulations, is not wholly confided to the strength of the ligaments, but in part to the tension, contraction, and elasticity of the muscular apparatus. When these healthy conditions are destroyed, and the liga- ments are alone left to maintain the integrity of the articulations, the superincumbent weight soon over- comes their power of resistance, and many deformi- ties are thus produced. The contraction of muscles, considered as a cause of deformities, cannot accomplish them but after having triumphed over the resistance of the liga- ments. This is effected by the superincumbent weight, and by the constant action of the muscles.

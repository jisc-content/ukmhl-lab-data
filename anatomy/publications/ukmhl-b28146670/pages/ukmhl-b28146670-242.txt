220 OF SPINAL DISTORTION FROM quisite, while proper means are adopted for the res- toration of the health. It cannot be too often assert- ed, or too forcibly urged, that this affection of the bones is the consequence and not the first cause of constitutional derangement. Restore the powers of the system at large, and you destroy the disease. A state of disease, the progress of which has been slow, and so little perceptible as to escape notice, until it has made considerable advances, is not to be removed in a few days, almost as much time is required for its removal as it took to be established. We are constantly baffled in our attempts to remove chronic diseases, because our object is speed, and in many instances, we relinquish our efforts when by patience and perseverance, we might have accom- plished our purpose. These remarks especially apply to that state of constitution, which engenders this malady, as well to scrophula, and other causes of diseased bone. The afflicting instances of deformity resulting from the disorders of which we are treating, should operate on the minds of patients and their friends, in adopting every means to prevent or re- move such melancholy accidents. The encourage- ment is sufficiently great, for we know that deformity may be altogether prevented if proper means are used at an early stage of the disease : when its rava- ges have caused ulceration or absorption of the bone, our only attempt can be, to arrest its progress and to encourage anchylosis.

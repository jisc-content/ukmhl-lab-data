187 DEFECTIVE MUSCULAlt ACTION. attitudes in sitting, standing or sleeping, arc the essential means for relieving recent cases of lateral, or anterior curvature from defective muscular action. In cases of some standing, where the contractions of the muscles, and ligaments, have fixed the de- viations of the vcrtebrie, more or less rigidly, we shall be obliged to use mechanical extension, before we can hope for much benefit from exercises. Much prejudice prevails among English sur- geons, with regard to the employment of machinery, to extend the spine: Mr. Shaw has raised some objections to it. In careless and ignorant hands, it is unquestionable, that unfortunate accidents have occurred, but we ought not to reject a most valuable means of removing some of the greatest of human misfortunes, because it has been abused. In France, mechanism is applied to distorted spines, with im- mense benefit, and some of those practitioners in this country, who have acquired eminence, for the treatment of this class of disorders, are indebted for their success to extension of the vertebral column. It is a most powerful auxiliary, and numerous cases of spinal deformity present themselves, which cannot be benefited, without the use of machinery, to over- come the contractions of the muscles, ligaments, and fibro-cartilages. All fibrous structure contains within itself a principle, by which it constantly con- tracts, when there is no resisting influence. If the fixed extremities ot muscles, or ligaments, are by

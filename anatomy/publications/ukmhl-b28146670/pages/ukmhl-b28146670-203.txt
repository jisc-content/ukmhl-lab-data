181 DEFECTIVE MUSCULAR ACTION. pelvis will seldom suffer, but if the distortion ap- peared before the age of five, when the effects of rickets usually take place, there will be more pro- bability of finding a narrow pelvis. Mr. Shaw thus expresses himself on this subject; “ I shall even venture to say, that on prosecuting the enquiry far- ther, we shall be induced to conclude, that, in what- ever state of distortion the spine and ribs may be, the bones of the pelvis will not be found distorted, unless there be at the same time, marks of rickets in some of the long or solid bones.” Instruments for the support of the spine have been charged with producing distortion of the pelvis, by their pressure on it as a point d’appui. What- ever other mischief may result from the machinery used to conceal distortions of the spine, it has no ill effect on the form of the pelvis, if there be no disease of the osseous system, and if there is, it would be madness to use machinery of any descrip- tion. In all cases of distorted pelves, there will be found unequivocal signs of rickets, or other disease of the bones. Treatment. Having endeavoured to describe those cases of distorted spine, which depend on some de- tect in the muscular system, we are now to speak of the treatment. It will be obvious, from the causes enumerated, whether debility, paralysis, or irregular action of muscles, that the indications of relief arc,

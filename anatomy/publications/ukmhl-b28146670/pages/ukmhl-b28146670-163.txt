141 OF LATERAL CURVATURE. of the anomalous complaints, to which hysterical and nervous women are so liable, may originate in these slight distortions of the lumbar vertebra?. 4 he affections of the spinal marrow are every day attract- ing more attention, and I have no doubt, that future investigations of this part of the animal economy, will lead to the elucidation of these, hitherto, in- tractable disorders. The first symptom which attracts attention, when a lateral curvature is forming, is the greater ele- vation of one shoulder; this is less perceptible in the morning than in the -evening, when the patient is fatigued. By degrees the shoulder rises more, is more full, and a slight lateral bend becomes per- ceptible in the spine. On examination, the spinous processes of the dorsal vertebrae will be found sweeping too much to the right, those of the lumbar to the left; if a plumb-line be held from the occi- put, and the points of the spinous processes be dotted with ink, the degree of deviation will be easily measured. In the dorsal region, the right side of the body will be more full, and rounder than the left, which is contracted and depressed : in the lumbar region the reverse condition will be found, fulness on the left, and sinking in on the right. (See plate 3.) The characteristic features of this variety of spinal distortion, are an elevation and fulness of the one shoulder, generally the right, and the opposite hip.

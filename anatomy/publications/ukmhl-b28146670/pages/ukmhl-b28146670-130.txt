108 TREATMENT OF VARUS. description of the apparatus in the last chapter. The horizontal spring, should at first be only mo- derately tense, and gradually increased until the foot is quite straight. Although I have particularly described the appa- ratus of Scarpa, I do not wish to be understood as recommending it in all cases, various modifications will be required to meet peculiar circumstances. In some forms of this distortion, simpler means, as that of Dr. Colles, will be efficient, but in more complicated cases, we shall find a necessity for other powers. A veiy excellent instrument is made by an ingenious mechanist, Mr. Taylor, in the Strand, it consists of an iron shoe, having a lever affixed by straps to the inside of the leg, with a bent spring passing from above the ankle-joint, to act on the foot when fixed in the shoe, and to force it towards its natural position. It may be sometimes neces- sary to combine the action of such an instrument as this, with that of Scarpa. Daily frictions and manipulations of the muscles, should be employed, as they materially assist the action of machinery, in bringing the parts into a healthy condition. During the treatment, we observe that the cal- losity of the skin, which was previously situated under the margin of the foot, is gradually removed to the dorsum : the external ankle, which almost touched the ground, by degrees assumes a more cle-

OF lâ€™IG EON, OR CHICKEN BREAST. 115 it is sometimes produced by pressure, blows or other accidents, which operate on the sides of the chest, or on the sternum: this, however, never happens except in unsound rickety children, whose bones and cartilages are soft, and ready to take any im- pression. In many instances, it may be considered, as the first indication of rickets. This malady is far from being uncommon, espe- cially among the children of the poor. It is seen every day at hospitals, and dispensaries, in the chil- dren of persons of scrophulous, or rickety consti- tutions, or among those, who live in the midst of damp, cold and dirt, who are ill-fed and worse clothed. The sternum forms a keel-like prominence, often attended with projection of the spine, like the back of a dog, indeed, the whole chest assumes the narrow form which characterises that of quadru- peds. Persons thus deformed, often have enlarged lymphatic glands and tonsils, with tumid abdomen: they are always subject to pulmonic complaints, which generally terminate, sooner or later, in phthi- sis. We may conceive the misery of that state in which, with a bad cough, there is a contracted chest, and enlarged tonsils ; and when the hooping-cough attacks such children, we have presented a spectacle of as much suffering, as human nature can well sus- tain. The chest is so compressed in some cases, that the two sides may be grasped with one hand. Al- i 2

DEFORMITIES FROM MALFORMATION 78 become more remarkable. The constant action of the weight of the body causes such an elongation ot the ligaments, that the trochanters, and heads of the femurs, have been observed, by Dupuytren, to rise in a few years, almost to a level with the crest of the ilia : so that as these persons, and more especially the females, advance in life, they become almost incapable of any exertion. As this malady does not affect the continuance of life, but few opportunities of post-mortem exami- nations have occurred. In the dissections made by Dupuytren, he found that those muscles which were not impeded in their motions, had acquired an ex- traordinary development, while others were almost entirely degenerated, being reduced to a kind of tis- sue, which had lost every vestige of muscular fibre. There was some attempt at the formation of a cavity, in that part of the ilium, to which the bead of the femur had been removed, similar to the arrangements round the same part, in unreduced dislocations : this new cavity was very superficial, with very little elevated margin, and was situated in the external iliac fossa, above, and behind the ace- tabulum. In some instances, the round ligament was preserved, but much elongated, and flattened in its form, (Dupuytren) ; in others, this ligament had acquired a conical shape, was very powerful, and filled by its base, a deformed cotyloid cavity: it embraced the whole of a simulated bead of the

Progressive absorption begins on the an- terior surface of the vertebrae, and proceeds gradually backward ; in this manner, many of the bodies of the vertebrae may be entirely removed without sup- puration. When suppuration takes place to a con- siderable extent, it constitutes lumbar, or psoas ab- scess. Anchylosis takes place not only between the bodies of the vertebrae, but also between the spinous and transverse processes. No trace of the existence of the bodies of many vertebrae can be found in some preparations, two, three, or four occupying the place of one. The ribs are also found anchylosed with each other, and with the vertebras. In caries of the spine they sometimes partake of the disease, and have been found soft and carious. SECTION III. OF ANGULAR PROJECTION. What has been named angular projection, is but a peculiar form of the curvature of the spine forwards; â€¢ the history in the preceding section equally applies

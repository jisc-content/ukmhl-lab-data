131 ON SPINAL DISTORTIONS. column is destined to carry the head, to support the ribs and thorax, as well as the upper extremities ; it forms the only solid portion of the abdominal cavity, and through the medium of the pelvic bones, it serves as a point dâ€™appui for the lower limbs. In its canal is contained, that important organ with which all the nerves of sensation and motion, below the head, communicate. Whether it supplies them with their materiel of power, or merely receives their intelligence, and conveys it to the brain, we shall not here enquire; certain it is, that when any portion of it is injured, or compressed, all the parts below are paralysed. A smaller degree of derange- ment, whether from irritation, inflammation, or any other cause, will produce a proportionate effect on all the parts, which are supplied with nerves from that portion of the spinal brain, which is affected. Many of the obscure, anomalous, and what are termed nervous cases, which so perplex us in practice, have unquestionably their origin within the spinal canal, and in such cases it will be wise to refer to that portion of the back, where the nerves of the dis- ordered part terminate. A more intimate acquaint- ance with neuralgic diseases, will probably establish the seat of many of them to be in the spinal marrow. There are three varieties of spinal distortion : 1, lateral curvature: 2, curvature forwards or an- gular projection, which are degrees of the same inflexion: and 3, curvature backwards. Some con-

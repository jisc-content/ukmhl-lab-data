175 DEFECTIVE MUSCULAR ACTION. of the back however weary, and the admonitions of parents and tutors are unceasing to keep herself erect. In this way the muscles of the back are overstrained, and the child will take every opportu- nity of relieving them, by falling into those positions which afford some relief. The comparative immunity of the higher classes of females, in hot climates, from spinal distortion, may in part depend on their freedom from the pres- sure of stays and bandages. Mr. Shaw has some good observations on this subject, he says “it is perhaps correct to say, that the less exercise a child takes, the more does it require general muscular re- laxation in the recumbent position, and that the lighter and more sedentary the pursuits are, the more necessity will there be, either for active exer- cise or general relaxation. Thus in warm climates, where active exercises cannot be taken, the due re- lation of parts, or balance of the system, is preserved by great indulgence in the recumbent position.” The effects of a constrained position of the body, and of defective muscular action, are farther increased by pressure on the muscles of the trunk by stays, which, like tight bandages to a limb, tend to produce extenuation of the muscles. They act injuriously in two ways : when very tight they cause wasting of the muscles by pressure, and when very stiff they in- duce debility of the muscles, by relieving them from a portion of their duty, and superseding the necessity

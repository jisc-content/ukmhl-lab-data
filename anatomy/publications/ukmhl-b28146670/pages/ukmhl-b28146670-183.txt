161 OP CURVATURE FORWARDS. destroyed, the anterior ligaments are sometimes found thickened, and partly ossified. In the pro- gressive absorption of the bodies of the vertebrae, the ligaments are preserved entire, but in the carious or ulcerative absorption, they are destroyed. When anchylosis has commenced, the anterior and poste- rior ligaments, have been found in different stages of conversion into bone, or, to speak more correctly, the arteries had deposited bony matter in their in- terstices. Where the cause of the curvature has been mus- cular debility, or rheumatism, the fibro-cartilages are much compressed, their anterior margin is ren- dered very thin, and in some cases the cartilage is entirely removed. The weight of the body, causing the absorption of the cartilages before it operates on the bones, which, as the curvature increases, are rendered cuneiform. The intervertebral substances have been found thickened and softened, their texture being infiltrated with a gelatinous fluid. The distended fibro-carti- lage forming a transverse ridge between the bodies of the vertebrae, and pressing on the spinal marrow, by protruding the posterior ligament into the canal. When the disease originates in the bones, the bodies of the vertebrae, are found in every degree of caries, or of progressive absorption. The other parts ot the vertebrae appear to be exempt, by their struc- ture, from this peculiar affection. The bodies of the M

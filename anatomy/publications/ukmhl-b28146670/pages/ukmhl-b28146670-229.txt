DISEASE OF THE FIBRO-CARTILAG ES. 207 It will be proper to extract blood, by cupping, or leeches, in the neighbourhood of the disease, and more advantage will be derived from their repeated application, than from one large bleeding, for it must always be borne in mind, that individuals most liable to this complaint, are not subjects to bear the loss of much blood. All chronic inflammations are to be removed by degrees, their inroads are slow, and their removal is almost equally so; by the repeti- tion of small bleedings, before the vessels have had time to become again distended, we may keep up the tonic power of their coats, by frequent diminu- tion of their contents. We shall thus induce a more healthy action, and restrain that debility, which per- mits exhalent or other vessels, to carry red blood, contrary to their healthy condition. Perhaps the term inflammation, is an improper designation for such a state, and it is in consequence of ignorance of the real nature of such derangements, that we employ the word. How essentially distinct, for example, are acute and chronic inflammations of the serous and mucous tissues: they are, in fact, to- tally different diseases. We want a term to desig- nate that state, which is called chronic inflamma- tion, and which is, in many instances, no inflamma- tion at all. In acute inflammation, we succeed in arresting its progress, by one or more large bleedings, it is as suddenly checked as it arose, but in chronic diseases,

57 ON RICKETS. however, a stop is put to its progress, the health is entirely re-established, but the distortions produced during the disease, are seldom altogether removed. Various morbid appearances have been found after death. Most of the abdominal viscera are enlarged. In the lungs we find various kinds and degrees of disorganisation. In the brain there is generally serous effusion on the pia mater and in the ventricles. The muscles are found pale or yellow, flaccid and emaciated. The bones are so soft, that they may be readily cut with a knife. Though the earthy matter of the bones is deficient, this is not the sole change: the close or compact structure is said to disappear, but the fact is, that it has not yet been formed. The interior of the bones presents no dis- tinct medullary cavity, nor cancellated structure, but has the loose cellular, or areolar arrangement, ob- served during the foetal period. The interstitial cells are filled with a brownish jelly-like substance, which appears to be a secretion from the medullary arteries. The colour of the bone is some shade of red, which it derives from numerous, large vessels, loaded with dark-coloured blood, deficient of fibrin. The periosteum is generally thickened and occasion- ally detached. In short, the rachitic bone is the foetal bone in its internal structure, but destitute of its proportion of calcareous matters.* * Craigieâ€™s Pathological Anatomy.

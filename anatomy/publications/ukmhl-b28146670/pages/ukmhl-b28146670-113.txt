91 CONTRACTIONS OF THE KNEE. bony deposition on the femur, tibia, and inside of patella. It is sometimes difficult to distinguish true anchy- losis from that state of rigidity of the joint, which admits of relief. This must be made out by an at- tentive investigation of the previous history of the case, whether it had originated in inflammation, whether any erosion of the cartilages had taken place, &c. Where the cause of impediment has its seat in the muscles, there will still remain some mobility in the joint: when true anchylosis has taken place the tibia can no longer be moved on the femur* and much pain will be produced by any forcible attempt at motion. In all stiff joints, from contraction of muscles or tendons, or from rigidity and condensation of the ligaments after disease, we may by perseverance almost invariably restore the action of the part. Gradual extension, friction, the application of va- pour, and mechanical aids, to allow of exercise, are the means to be employed. But before having re- course to them, we must be certain that all active mischief has ceased, and, be very cautious that we do not reproduce it. Among Mr. Amesburyâ€™s ingenious contrivances, is an apparatus for acting on a stiff knee-joint. It is a very efficient instrument, perfectly well adapted to overcome the rigidity of muscles and ligaments,

disease of the fibro-cartjlages. 197 stantly bearing on the diseased cartilages, the cur- vature will increase with more rapidity. The first stage of this disease is a slow, or scrophu- lous inflammation of the fibro-cartilages, the result of which is tumefaction and softness of their tissue. In many instances, the progress of the disease is extremely slow, but any derangement of the consti- tution, any accidental fever or other complaint, will call the mischief into full activity. It is under such circumstances that a fall, or other injury may appear to be the exciting cause, and generally bears the imputation of having solely produced the distortion. In the greater number of cases, the disease continues its progress unobserved, until the attention is called to an unnatural elevation, and protrusion of one shoulder, when a key to the disordered health is discovered. If the progress of the malady be not now arrested, the symptoms become aggravated, pains are felt between the shoulders, which are carried forwards in search of an easy position. The effect ol this slowly progressive inflammation of the intervertebral substance, is to soften its texture, and destroy its elasticity, so that when the spine is acted upon by the muscles, it no longer retains the power of returning to its natural position, and a curvature is formed. In this class of spinal distortions, the muscles may be the active means of drawing the spine out of its position, but the cause of the malady is not with

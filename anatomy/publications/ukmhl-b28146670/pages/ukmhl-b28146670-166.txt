144 OF LATERAL CURVATURE. readily be effected in the dorsal region, without any previous curvature in the loins, and the first inflec- tion will take place, where there is a constant solici- tation to the right. When a curvature has been once established, it generally goes on increasing, and a lateral curvature, as it advances, becomes complicated with distortion of the whole trunk. The ribs on the convex side are curved outwards, forming a hump, while the anterior part ol the thorax becomes unusually flat, or sinks inwards. On the concave side of the dis- tortion, the ribs are thrown forwards, while they â–  present a hollow behind. These distortions of the ribs will be greater, or less, according to the degree of spinal deformity, and the rigidity, or relaxation of their articulations. In extreme cases the ribs arc drawn into the axis of the chest, their upper edge becomes external, and their internal surface is turned upwards ; they press upon, and mutually deform, each other, contract species of articulations at the points of contact, unite together in these points by a new fibrous tissue, and are sometimes completely anchylosed by bony secretion. In cases where the deformity of the ribs is not carried to this extent, the advantage is balanced by the want of security, arising from the great relaxation of their articular ligaments. To attempt to describe all the variations in the form of the chest, in lateral curvatures, would per-

106 TREATMENT OF VARUS. quire strength, and to increase in form, as soon as tlie foot is restored to its natural direction. Neither is age always insurmountable, since many cures have been effected, after the body had ceased to grow. Every thing depends on the integrity of the bones, and the flexibility of the joints. Whatever machines may be employed in these cases, we should be guided by the principle, of ap- plying a power which shall gradually restore the foot to its natural direction, without causing pain, or other inconvenience, and without impeding pro- gression during the period of the treatment. All the instruments used for this purpose, consist of one or more levers, to draw the foot in an opposite di- rection to that of the deviation. Some variations will be required in each individual case, to render the machine as little inconvenient as possible. The objects proposed in the application of ma- chinery, in these distortions, are, 1st, to effect a gradual turning of the bones of the tarsus, meta- tarsus, and phalanges, in a contrary direction, to that which the deformity has produced, and to re- store the fore part of the foot to its proper and na- tural direction with the tibia ; 2d, to substitute for the deficiency of the external ligaments, but more especially for the peronei muscles, an artificial force, capable not only of counterbalancing that of the tense internal ligaments, and shortened tibiales mus- cles, but of overpowering it, and of causing the ex-

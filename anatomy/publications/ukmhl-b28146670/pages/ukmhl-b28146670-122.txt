100 OF VARUS. The thigh of the deformed side, was of nearly equal size with that of the sound limb, but the leg was emaciated. The subcutaneous adipose tissue of the foot was of considerable thickness. The skin was callous, the cutis being thickened, and the cuti- cle composed of several laminae, on the projecting point of the os calcis, which bore on the ground. Between this tuberosity and the skin, was an irregu- lar subcutaneous synovial capsule, which facilitated the gliding of the skin over this part. The skin of the sole of the foot, was similar to any other not subjected to pressure. The aponeurosis of the leg was much thimier than natural, and had lost part of that glistening appear- ance peculiar to it. The nerves supplying the mus- cles of leg and foot, were extremely small. The tibial arteries were not half their usual size, and no injection percolated the muscular branches. The veins were equally reduced in dimensions. Of the muscles of the leg, the gastrocnemius interims and the soleus, preserved some fibres of the colour and texture peculiar to muscles, all the rest were degene- rated into a yellow, fatty substance. The tendons were very small: the tendo achillis was not half so large as that of the healthy limb. The plantar aponeurosis was reduced in thickness, and had lost its nacreous appearance: "showing that exercise is as essential an agent in the development of tendons, and aponeuroses, as in that of the muscles.

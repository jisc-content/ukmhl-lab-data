J84 OF SPINAL DISTORTION FROM are they prescribed in cases of deformity, but chil- dren of weakly habits, convalescents, hypochon- driacs, and other invalids, are sent to the gymnasia, instead of the chemists, and exercise is considered as a better tonic than quinine. In the numerous establishments on the Continent, for the cure of deformities, every variety of exercise, which could be contrived, has been employed, and apparently with great success. Among the plates of Delpech, will be found representations of the positions, in which his convalescent patients are required lo place themselves, many of which would accord very well with lads who were intended for the sea, but are preposterous in the persons of growing girls.â€” However, some of these exercises may be employed with great advantage in spinal distortions, but they should be regulated to the strength of the individual, and varied according to each particular case. When curvature of the spine is attributable to car- rying weights on one arm, to peculiar attitudes, or other habits, these must of course be discontinued, and in slight cases, the causes being removed, the effects will cease. We can never expect that stays will be relin- quished, such is the force of habit, that few women could dispense with them without great inconveni- ence. It is commonly considered, that if stays are not stiff they can do no mischief, but perhaps more ill effects are produced, if they are too tightly laced.

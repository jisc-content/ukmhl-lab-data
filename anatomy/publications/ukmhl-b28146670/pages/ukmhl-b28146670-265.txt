USED IN TREATMENT OF DEFORMITIES. 24 3 muscles or contracted ligaments. Various and com- plicated instruments have been invented for this purpose, but the simple contrivance of Mr. Ames- bury for stiff* joints, will in the majority of cases be found efficient. The machinery employed in the treatment of club feet, is as various as there are various machinists, each preferring his own contrivance or adoption.â€”- Those instruments are best, which act bv an elastic force, supplied by means of springs. Some instru- ments act by pushing, and others by drawing the foot in an opposite direction to that of the distortion. It is generally necessary to have more than one spring, because in most cases the foot is distorted in more than one direction: so numerous, indeed, are the differences in individual cases that no one ma- chine can be applicable to all without some little modification. The succeeding wood-cut represents the instru- ment of Scarpa, slightly altered, it acts in the first instance by drawing the toes outwards, and then by bringing the whole foot into its proper direction with the bones of the leg. This figure represents the instrument, as it is required for the common cases, where the foot and toes are turned inwards.

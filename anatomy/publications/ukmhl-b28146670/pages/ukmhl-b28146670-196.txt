174 OF SPINAL DISTORTIONS FROM cles ceases. When such occupations arc continued late in life, the ligaments will remain in a lengthened state, the joints will be loose, and we find that opera- dancers, &c. when, by age or infirmity, their mus- cular power has diminished, have their feet deformed, and their gait impaired. Inequality of power in antagonist muscles is a frequent cause of deformity in the limbs and joints. As the limbs on the right side of the body are gene- rally more powerful than those of the left, so this must be in some degree the case with the muscles, on the two sides of the spine, and in persons of weak relaxed habits may be partly the means of producing a lateral curvature. In these cases, there should be one general curve of the vertebrae towards one side, but this is a very rare occurrence in comparison with the number of cases where there are two, three or four curvatures in alternately opposite directions. Inactivity is not alone sufficient to account for that degree of muscular debility, which induces spinal deformity. In warm climates, women take less exercise than they do in this country, and yet curvature of the spine is infinitely more rare in such countries, than in our own. In hot climates, all people indulge more in a recumbent position, re- posing themselves when fatigued, as Nature dictates. With us, a girl from the age of 10, is obliged through- out the day, to maintain a constrained position of the body, she is not permitted to rest the muscles

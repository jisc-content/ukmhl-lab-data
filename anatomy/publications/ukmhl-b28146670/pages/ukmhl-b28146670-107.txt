85 OF THE KNEE-JOINT. having more or less of an outward aspect: this in- creases the outward direction of the toes. This deviation of the leg, greatly diminishes the solidity of station and motion : the limb being shortened, in standing the body is inclined towards the defective side, and walking is effected by a se- ries of falls : the leg is obliged to execute a circular motion, which impedes progression, and renders it insecure. The relations of the bones being altered, those of the muscles are also, and this of course af- fects the facility, and the power of their action. These alterations of form necessarily produce others. The leg cannot have its axis changed, with- out influencing the position of the foot. The trans- mission of the weight of the superior parts, by the tibia to the tarsus, is not made, as it should be, in a perpendicular line on the astragalus, the keystone of the arch of the foot. The pressure is made ob- liquely, and falls, at least in part, on the os calcis, which is not so well disposed to bear it as the as- tragalus. The foot subjected to this defective ac- tion becomes flattened, in consequence of the elon- gation of the ligaments of its internal margin, where much of the weight falls, which ought to be par- ticipated by the opposite side. The articulating surfaces of the femur, and tibia, arc more used on their external, than on their in- ternal hall ; the internal lateral ligaments, and the cross ligaments of the joint, are exposed to unnatural

OP VARUS 96 that there were several other malformations and defects. Both hands were distorted, the phalanges of the thumb, the corresponding metacarpal bone, the os trapezium, and a portion of the radius, were wanting, on the right side : there was also deformity of the pelvis, congenital dislocation of the hip-joint, and the rectum opened into the bladder. M. Cru- veilheir deduces all these defects from pressure: compression of the pelvis, he supposes, caused the dislocation, and likewise the malformation of the rectum. But it appears more reasonable, to refer all such defects, to some original vice in the primi- tive formation, the result of which, in some instances, may have been increased by peculiarity of attitude in the uterus. The* great variety of form in club- feet, renders this supposition probable, we scarcely meet with any two cases exactly similar, which also accounts for the discrepancies of opinion, among those who have detailed dissections of such parts. OF VARUS. The characteristic feature of this variety is inver- sion of the foot. The point of the foot is turned inwards and upwards. The degree of deviation varies in every case; where it is slight, the external part of the sole of the foot, presses on tlfe ground, while the internal margin ot the plantar region, affords no support. The deformity may stop at this point, but when no remedial means are employed,

DEFECTIVE MUSCULAR ACTION. 17/ there was some relation of cause and effect, and rea- son to suppose that the morbific state had induced a change in the nutritive functions, with regard to the osseous system. For it is in the bone alone that the growth occurs, all the other parts being at the same time emaciated. This state of things fre- quently engenders curvature of the spine, as it did in the instance here referred to. There are few children of either sex, about the age of ten or twelve, who do not hold the body bent forwards, especially when they grow rapidly, because the muscles are weak, and the weight of the superior parts is thrown on the ligaments, and fibro-cartilages. As the skeleton becomes developed, and the chest enlarges, the muscles acquire vigour, they restore the spine, re-establish a proper equilibrium, relieve the ligaments, and dissipate all fear of deformity. There are few mothers who have not felt alarm under these circumstances, for the form of a child, which has afterwards been developed without the least accident. Persons who, during the period of youth, have suffered from protracted illness, will sometimes have a degree of this kind of deformity permanently established, and become what is called “ round shouldered.” These inclinations of the spine, produced by temporary debility of the mus- cular system, are generally forwards : but if the liga- ments of one side, give way to a greater extent than those of the other, in any one point, then we shall N

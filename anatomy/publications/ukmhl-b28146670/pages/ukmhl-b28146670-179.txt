OF CURVATURE FORWARDS. 157 tion of a portion of the medulla, are recorded by Ollivier, and others. Numerous dissections have shewn that the aorta, vena cava, and thoracic duct, follow the circuitous route of the spine, but I shall avoid repetition by referring to the observations on this subject in the account of lateral curvature, many of which equally apply to the variety of distortion now under consi- deration. When the malady is seated in the dorsal vertebrae the ribs are elongated, being drawn backwards by the receding vertebrae, so that the long diameter of the chest is reversed, and instead of being from side to side, becomes antero-posterior. The ribs are extenuated and rounded in form. The anterior part of the chest is narrow, and the sternum appears to project too much forwards. In some cases the sternum is bent, and forms an arch, the ensiform cartilage being entirely concealed. The scapulae are more or less changed in situation; when the distortion is considerable, and has com- menced at an early age, they suffer in development. When the upper dorsal vertebrae project backwards, the superior portion of the scapulas is also carried in the same direction: their inferior surface is thrown backwards and outwards, when the hump is formed by the middle dorsal vertebrae. As the disease advances, the ribs become straightened, and, losing their convexity, no longer afford the scapulae

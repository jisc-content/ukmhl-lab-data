In this deformity, the spine is bent backwards, so that the occiput is brought nearer to the sacrum ; it is the most uncommon of all the varieties ot spinal curvature. It occurs occasionally in the loins, but the deviation of the vertebrae hardly amounts to distortion, since it is but an increased degree ot the natural curve of these bones forwards. Indeed, so far from being considered a deformity, this great bend of the back is at the present moment in fashion, for it appears to be the object of the present race of staymakers, and other manufacturers of ladies’ figures, to force forwards the loins and pelvis, while the shoulders are thrown as far back as possible. Mr. Bampfield mentions a case of great curvature backwards of the cervical vertebrae, where the occi- put approached so nearly to the first dorsal vertebra, that the intervening space was only a finger’s breadth. This was in a rickety and diseased child. Preternatural inclination of the lumbar vertebrae forwards, has been met with, in consequence of a shortened or contracted state of the psoas, and iliacus muscles. When an attempt was made to produce perfect extension of the thigh, the lumbar vertebrae were drawn still farther inwards. These curvatures

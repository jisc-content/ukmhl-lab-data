The posterior vertebral ligament is within the medullary canal, at the back part of the bodies of the vertebrae, and is similarly distributed to the anterior. The articulating processes are connected by capsular ligaments. The plates of the vertebrae are united by the yellow liga- ments, each inserted above, into the inner surface of the superior plate, and below, into the upper border of the inferior plate : these ligaments are formed of dense yellow fibres, elastic and resistant: they complete the vertebral canal posteriorly, by filling up the vacancies between the several bones. The spinous processes are connected by the inter- spinous ligaments ; these occupy, in the dorsal and lumbar regions, the intervals of the processes; they are wanting in the neck: the supra-spinous ligaments extend from the summit of one spinous process to that of another, in the whole line, from the seventh cervical vertebra, to the middle crest of the sacrum. The intervertebral substance being composed of concentric laminae, dense and elastic towards the ex- terior, very much softer towards the centre, where it becomes a soft pulpy tissue, a kind of motion is permitted between each vertebra, similar to that which would be produced by a spherical body and

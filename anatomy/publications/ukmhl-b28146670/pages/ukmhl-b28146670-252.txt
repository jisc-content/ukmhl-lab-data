I ( 230 ) CHAPTER XII. On the Mechanical Apparatus used in the Treatment of Deformities. To describe a tenth part of the machinery, invented for the cure of deformities, would alone require a larger volume than the present. I shall therefore confine my observations to some of the instruments employed in distortions, and to the principles on which they are applied. Before the knowledge of anatomy was much diÂ£- fused, the spine was considered by many as a single bone, and its curvatures were treated in the same manner that a bent stick would be, when the object was to make it straight. Force was applied to the two extremities to draw them into their proper posi- tion, and pressure was applied to the prominent part to thrust it into its place. Projections of the spine were afterwards considered to depend on dislocation of the vertebras, a circumstance that can rarely hap- pen among the cervical or lumbar vertebrae, and never among the dorsal, without fracture of some part of the bone, or most extraordinary relaxation of the connecting bonds of the ribs, and vertebrae. This opinion, however, is still maintained, and the

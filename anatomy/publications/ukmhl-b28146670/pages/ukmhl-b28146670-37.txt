15 VERTEBRAL COLUMN. tween the head and the atlas permitting only a hinge-like motion. Perhaps there is no instance more illustrative of design, than the structure of the two first vertebras, their connexion with each other, and with the head. The conjoined vertebra; form a large canal, through which the spinal marrow passes, giving off nerves as it proceeds, to all the lower parts of the body ; these nerves pass out in pairs, through holes formed by the junction of two vertebrae. The intervertebral substance, which is interposed between the vertebrae, may be compared to gum elastic ; it readily yields to whichever side we may have occasion to turn, and in a moment recovers itself. During the day, it gradually sinks under the pressure of its burden, and we are said to be an inch shorter at night than when we rise in the morning. In old age we are shorter than in youth, and it is by the yielding and condensation of this substance, that the bent back of senility is produced. The bones of the spine are also kept together by many strong ligaments. The anterior vertebral ligament connects the fore part of the bodies, and extends from the neck to the upper part of the sacrum ; it is narrow in the neck, broader in the back and loins. In this ligament there are three sets of fibres, the superficial, fixed superiorly to the body, or fibro- cartilage of one vertebra ; and, infcriorly, to the

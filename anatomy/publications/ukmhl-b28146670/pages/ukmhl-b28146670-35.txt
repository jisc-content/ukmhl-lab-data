STRUCTURE OF THE VERTEBRAL COLUMN. 13 nal to this, wc find strong ligaments, from point to point of the bones, binding them together, with- out preventing proper motion. We may imagine the spring and elasticity of twenty-six bones thus united. In walking, the heel first touches the ground. If the bones of the leg had been perpendicular over that part of the foot which first touches the ground, we should come down with a sudden jolt, instead of which we descend in a semicircle, of which the point of the heel is the centre. The number of parts which constitute the foot, prevent any violent shock to the frame, in the vari- ous kinds of action in which it may be used. In leaping, we endeavour to alight on the toes, in order to break the force of the fall, by dividing it among the numerous articulations of the tarsus and meta- tarsus. When the entire sole of the foot strikes the ground, in falls, it is not a very uncommon occur- rence to have the neck of the thigh-bone fractured, in consequence of the succussion not being arrested by the small bones of the foot. As the vertebral column is the seat of the princi- pal deformities of the human frame, it will be pro- per to dwell on its structure with some minuteness. The spine is composed of numerous bones, but from their compactness and continuity it is spoken of as a single bone, and acquires its common name from the ridge formed by projecting parts of each

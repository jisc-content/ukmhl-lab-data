OF CURVATURE FORWARDS. 153 nature of the complaint is not suspected, until one or more of the spinous processes project backwards. In the chapters devoted to the consideration oi the diseases which lead to the formation of spinal distortions, I shall dwell at large on the early symp- toms of those morbid conditions of the muscles, ligaments, cartilages, and bones, which are the real causes of these deformities. In this section I shall briefly follow the progress of the malady, and confine myself to a description of the alterations of form externally, and internally, their effects on various functions, and the appearances on dissec- tion. In those cases attended with pain in the vertebras, an accurate examination will detect an irregularity in one or more of the spinous processes, and if the body be bent forwards, this will be more apparent. At this period, the deviation disappears when the patient is in the recumbent position. After some time the spinous processes more evidently project, and are soon followed by others above and below the original seat of the disease : their projection beyond the proper line will be found to vary from half an inch to two inches. Sometimes the whole of the dorsal vertebrae, are included in the curvature. When the disease occurs in this region, the curve is larger and less abrupt than when it takes place in the loins, because the closer attachments of the dorsal vertebrae together

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS 126 made more progress during the last thirty years, than was effected by the labours and investigations of philosophers, during all the preceding ages of the world. This applies perhaps more truly to medicine than any other branch, and the greater number of the maladies, of which I am about to speak, were absolutely unknown, at least their real nature was not understood, before the commencement of the present century. Indeed, it is only within the last ten years that the subject has been thoroughly un- derstood, and the works of Mr. C. Bell, and the late Mr. Shaw, have been the cause of more correct en- quiries into the nature of spinal diseases, not only in this country, but on the Continent. To Mr. Shaw we are indebted for the best work on lateral curva- ture, and for calling our attention to muscular inac- tivity and consequent debility, from which this variety of distortion most commonly originates. Delpech, in France, has carried pathological inves- tigations farther than any other writer, his account of curvatures from chronic inflammation, or what he terms, a peculiar affection of the fibro-cartilages, and from a tuberculated condition of the vertebrae, being derived from extensive opportunities of post-mortem enquiries, are particularly valuable. By fair analogy we may expect to find in the joints of the spine, the same diseases which attack analogous structures in the other articulations ot the body, and any man of unbiassed judgment, will

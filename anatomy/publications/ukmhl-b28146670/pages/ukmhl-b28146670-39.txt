17 VERTEBRAL COLUMN. an exactly correspondent cavity : and there would be much greater latitude of motion, were it not con- trolled by the yellow, and other ligaments. Such- are some of the means, employed by Na- ture, in the construction of this most important part of the animal frame, for we have not yet mentioned the muscles, which contribute to the establishment of this beautiful chain of joints. Various difficult, and almost inconsistent offices, were to be executed by the vertebral column. It was required to be firm, yet flexible ; firm, to support the erect position of the body ; flexible, to permit the trunk to be bent in every degree of curvature. It was also to contain a cavity, to contain and defend an essential part of the nervous system, the spinal brain, a sub- stance not only of the first necessity to sensation and motion, but of a nature so delicate and tender, and so impatient of injury, that the smallest unna- tural pressure, or any considerable obstruction in its course, will produce paralysis or death.

The flexibility varies in different parts of the column ; is least in the back, where strength, more than flexure, was c

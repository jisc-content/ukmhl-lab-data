USED IN TREATMENT OF DEFORMITIES. 235 from diseases of the cartilages and bones: with the occasional use of spine-supporters in the intervals of repose and exercise: friction, manipulation and even pressure to lateral curvatures and projecting ribs: and undeviating rest in cases of caries. Machinery-is used in the treatment of deformities on two principlesâ€”1, to take off the superincum- bent weight, from bones, cartilages, and ligaments, when these are diseased, softened, or relaxed, and incapable of performing their respective offices : 2, to act on shortened, contracted or rigid parts, and by extension to elongate them, or to bring them to their natural positions. On the first principle we make use of instruments to support the weight of the upper parts, when the limbs or spine, from any cause, are incapable of doing so. The various back- boards, collars, &c. used in curvatures of the spine and the machinery employed in cases of distorted knees, and bent legs, are applied on this principle. Contrivances for extending the spine, for extending or bending contracted joints, for restoring club-feet &c. are used on the second principle. In some in- stances both principles are combined. I shall say a few words on some of the various instruments used for these purposes in the order in which thev are enumerated above. Crutches are the simplest contrivances used on the first principle, when the lower limbs lose the power of supporting the weight of the body. The

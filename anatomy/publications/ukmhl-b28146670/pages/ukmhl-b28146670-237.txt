215 DISEASE OF THE BONES. , that the spinous processes of the cervical and lumbar vertebrae are horizontal, while those of the dorsal vertebrae are inclined downwards, each being cover- ed by the one above it; that the spinous process of the last cervical vertebra naturally projects farther than the others, and has been mistaken for a morbid appearance. The symptoms accompanying this disease of the spine will vary according to the region in which it is seated; the functions which are disordered being connected with the affected part through the medium of the nerves. If the disease is in the cervical region, there is pain and difficulty in rotation, and other motions of the head, and oppression in breath- ing will be one of the most marked symptoms. If the dorsal region is the seat of the disease, the prin- cipal symptoms will be constriction at the epigas- trium. and disordered digestion. The functions of the bladder and rectum will be more or less derang- ed according to the extent of the mischief, when it occurs in the lumbar vertebrae.

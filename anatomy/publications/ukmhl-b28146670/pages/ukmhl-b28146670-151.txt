129 ON SPINAL DISTORTIONS. results. If an abcess forms in the upper part of the lung, the cyst will be attached by adhesive inflam- mation, to the three or four upper ribs, and also to the spine: after evacuation of the pus, the fibrous matter forming the cyst, will contract and bring together the ribs and the vertebras. This fibrous matter sometimes ossifies, and the deformity becomes fixed and apparent. Recoveries from phthisis and empyema, in this climate at least, are so rare, that we are not likely to have our attention frequently directed to these results. Some cases of deformity arise from congenital inequality of the two sides of the body. The mus- cles, and in some instances the bones, are less de- veloped on one side of the mesial line, than on the other. The most important of these cases is where one lower extremity is shorter than the other : an account of this will be found in its proper place. The undue development of the bones or muscles of one side of the vertebral column, must be so rare a cause of distortion, that we may safely pass it by without further comment. Rheumatism is a very common cause of curvature of the spine. In these cases the vertebral column is implicated, and a great arc is formed, the concavity of which is always forwards. The fibrous apparatus on the anterior part of the bodies of the vertebrae, is extremely liable to rheumatism, we may also ex- pect, from analogy, that the fibro-cartilages are so me- lt

112 OF THE PES EQUINUS. generally happens that, the foot is inclined to one side, so that in the course of time this deformity is often complicated with one of the other varieties of club-foot. By the continual retraction of the heel, the upper surface of the astragalus becomes so displaced for- wards, that it no longer remains in contact with the tibia, which bone in old cases rests almost entirely on the posterior part of the calcis. In the majority of cases there is no separation between the bones of the tarsus, or of the metatarsus, nor are these bones displaced as in the other varieties of club- foot, but in very old cases, they are longer in pro- portion on their superior surface, to what they are on the inferior. In the fourth volume of the “ Repertoire d’Ana- tomic,” a case is described by M. Holtz, where the toes were so completely turned under, that the patient walked on the dorsum of the foot. The deformity existed on both sides, the legs were of equal size at all parts, the calves not formed. Walking was not painful, the patient moved easily without support. The knees were always somewhat bent, to maintain the centre of gravity. The tarsus bore on the ground, nearer to its external than its internal mar- gin. He wore ordinary boots, but with the heels in front, and the points behind. This man died in the hospital at Strasburg, and the following description is given of the dissection.

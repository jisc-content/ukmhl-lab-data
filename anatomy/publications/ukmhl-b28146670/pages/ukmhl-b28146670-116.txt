94 OF CLUB-FOOT. been retained, and are used by modern writers to designate the same deformities. A third kind, where the toes are directed downwards, the foot being retained nearly in the same axis with the leg, has been termed pes equinus, in common language, pointed toe. Of these varieties, the varus is the most common ; for one case of valgus, we meet with a hundred of varus. The pes equinus is generally complicated with some degree of the other varieties. In long-standing cases of these deformities, the foot, instead of being a machine in which all the parts move under the influence of the muscles, be- comes an irregular assemblage of pieces, which enjoy but a very limited motion. There was no good description of club-foot, before that of Scarpa was published. Duverney and others, attributed torsion of the feet, to unequal contraction of the muscles, but Scarpa found that the position of the bones was imperfect from the earliest period. Some consider these deformities to be produced by the imagination of the mother : others think they are the effect of the false position of the legs of the foe- tus in utero : while others again look for the cause in want of room in the uterus. Some French writers attribute this, and other congenital deformities, to convulsions of the foetus before birth. Breschet who has studied the development of the embryo, and foetus, and has paid much attention to monstrosities, regards this vice of conformation as an imperfect

Among the remedies usually applied to such derangements, a recumbent position is instinctively adopted by the patient; the symptoms are thus alleviated, and some- times removed, to be reproduced by the weight of the upper part of the body or other exciting cause operating on the diseased cartilages.

The pain is usually described as heavy, dull, aching, very similar to slight rheu- matism.

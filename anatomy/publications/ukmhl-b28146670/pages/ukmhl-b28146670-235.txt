OF SPINAL DISTORTION, ETC. 213 will project backwards, forming the segment of a circle, or an angle. In these latter cases, the hap- piest result is anchylosis, and the spine remains for life, permanently deformed. The projection is pro- duced more gradually, when the disease occurs in the dorsal region, than in the lumbar: one or more spinous processes are observed to protrude, and are followed by three or four above or below. The transverse processes, project on each side of the spinous, elevate and stretch the muscles, and integu- ments, producing an arch from side to side, of which the spinous processes form the centre. Although the leading character of the deformities produced by this disease, is inflection of the spine forwards, in many instances there is also some degree of late- ral curvature. The early symptoms are so equivocal, that the disease is often overlooked, until the deformity makes its appearance. In some cases, there is considerable pain experienced in the vertebras, in others little or none, unless they are much pressed on, and even this often fails to produce any uneasiness. Persons of all ages, are liable to this disease. When it occurs in infants, it is unobserved, until about the period when they should walk ; and them too often, the child is merely considered backward, and the malady is left to continue its uninterrupted course. When it attacks children, who have walked, the loss ol power in the legs is gradual, they are

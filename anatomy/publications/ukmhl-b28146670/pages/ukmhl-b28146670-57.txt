ON DEFORMITIES. 35 on the other hand, distortions produced by other causes, engender debility of muscles, by destroying their equilibrium. As muscular contractility becomes enfeebled, by disease or age, efforts will be made to place the body in those attitudes, and to move it in that man- ner, in which the least possible expenditure of mus- cular power shall be required. An old horse loses all the grace of his motions, and all the easiness of his paces: his legs become stiff, and he moves them as if they consisted of one piece : he stumbles easily, and his loins present a remarkable curvature : he avoids muscular exertion, and confides the weight of his body as far as he can, to the sole resistance of the ligaments. In early age, the natural alternate curves of the spine are not formed. The infant, when placed up- right, bends its body forwards, the weight of the trunk pressing entirely on the anterior part of the spine, until the muscles of the back have acquired strength enough to maintain the erect position. There are few children of 10 or 12 who do not hold the body bent forwards, especially if their growth be rapid: the object is to save the muscles; but as the chest ex- pands, and the muscles acquire more vigour, the spine is brought back to its proper form. We meet with the same appearances in some incipient spine cases, and experience of the unaided powers of nature, to restore the former temporary deviations, have too d 2

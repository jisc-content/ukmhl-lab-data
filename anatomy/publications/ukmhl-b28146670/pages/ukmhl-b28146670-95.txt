OF THE HIP-JOINT. 73 neck forming a styloid process, more or less elon- gated : sometimes the cavity ot the acetabulum, is merely a superficial depression, or groove: most frequently, the two parts are united by an interme- diate ligament, of different form and length, but in some cases, they are entirely independent. The opposed articular surfaces bear no affinity, and per- mit an extraordinary degree of motion ; the limb may be moved in directions quite opposed to the natural conditions of the joint: it may be greatly elongated by extension, on the cessation of which it will be retracted. In most instances, precisely the same appearances occur on both sides: in others, there are evident differences, although both may be deformed. The superior extremity of the femur, is of much smaller dimensions, than it ought to be, and per- haps, as a law of formation, the necessary conse- quence, is defect in the cotyloid cavity. On the one hand, the head of the thigh-bone, is not regu- lar, nor even formed, but is replaced by a smooth plate, or a style, which contains but a small pro- portion of the osseous matter it ought to have : on the other hand, the acetabulum, not having been moulded by the round head of the femur, has been at liberty to assume the form of an irregular oval, of large vertical diameter, or of an ill-shaped tri- angle, or ot a simple furrow, surmounted, or not, by a horizontal plate. The consequence of such

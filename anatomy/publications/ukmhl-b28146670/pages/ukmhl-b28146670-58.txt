GENERAL OBSERVATIONS 36 often caused the latter to be neglected in their early stages. Some persons, who during youth have been assailed by very long illness, attended with much muscular debility, and consequently curvature of the spine forwards, have preserved this form throughout life, being what is termed round-shouldered. These occasional curvatures of the spine from muscular debility, will generally be forwards. If the liga- ments, or muscles, be weaker on one side than the other, there will also be lateral curvature; and as the equilibrium of the trunk will now be menaced, an effort will be made to draw the spine in an opposite direction to the primary curvature. These things are common, of daily occurrence, and prove the fact of muscular debility, from the speedy restoration of the natural form, by means which strengthen the system; exercise, good diet, cold bathing, &c. Not that by these means the ligaments are directly dimi- nished in length, but the muscles recover their power, and by re-establishing the natural direction of the bones, they remove the causes of the stress on the ligaments, and these latter as a matter of course soon acquire a proper density. The foregoing observations lead to the considera- tion of the effects produced on the skeleton by pe- culiar attitudes. In all persons who from accident or disease have one extremity shorter than the other, there is an inclination of the pelvis towards the side of the infirmity; the spine bends in the opposite

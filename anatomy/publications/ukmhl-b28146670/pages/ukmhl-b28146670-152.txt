130 GENERAL OBSERVATIONS times the seat of this disease, and the contraction of these parts will necessarily incurvate the spine forwards. In subjects predisposed to rheumatism, the slight- est twist ot the spine will often produce a return of the disease : the writer of this, experienced an attack of lumbago and sciatica, which lasted for months, by suddenly jumping out of bed, and giving the back ajar. In such constitutions a slight deformity of the spine, which has been considered as perma- nent, will sometimes make a sudden and enormous progress. In distortions from rheumatism, the curvature of the spine forwards, is, in some measure, the effect of indulgence in the most easy position. Few cases of curvature can be referred exclusively to any one cause, there is generally one or more secondary causes, which operate in conjunction with the pri- mary. So, in rheumatic curvatures, there is gene- rally defective action in the extensor muscles of the back : this operates by allowing an anterior flexion of the vertebral column, on the same principal that it does in the bent back of infancy and of old age. The difficulty of correctly judging of any malady is greater, as the organization of the part affected, is more complicated and its functions more varied.

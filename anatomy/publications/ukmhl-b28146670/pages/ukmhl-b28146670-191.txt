169 DEFECTIVE MUSCULAR ACTION. in the fibro-cartilagcs : but as these latter states are, in some instances, consecutive to muscular debility, they may be placed in a secondary rank, as causes of distortion. Muscular debility is a common consequence ol lever, or any general disturbance of the health, but in the form of malady we are now considering, it is generally the result of too little exercise, and is therefore a cause, as well as a consequence of ill health. Those muscles which should maintain the spine in its upright position, become so weakened that they are incapable of properly performing that office. We have endeavoured to shew, that the ligaments permit motion, but are not of themselves alone, adequate to maintain the articulations, without the aid of the muscles: consequently, when these fail in the performance of their functions, the weight of the body bears on the ligaments and fibro-carti- lages which yield to the pressure, and spinal dis- tortion ensues. Distortions of the spine from this cause, most commonly occur in girls from the age of ten to six- teen. Weakness of the frame from some temporary derangement of health often lays the foundation, and the deformity sometimes makes great progress before it excites attention. In this variety of cur- vature, the lumbar vertebra almost invariably give way first, as we should naturally expect, not only from the greater mobility of this region, but from

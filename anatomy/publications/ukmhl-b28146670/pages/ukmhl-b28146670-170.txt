148 OF LATERAL CURVATURE. directions. If the malady originated in the want of due antagonism in two sets of muscles, the vertebral column would be bent on one side only, but this is comparatively a rare case. However, in admitting the fact of the greater number of lateral deviations in the dorsal region, towards the right side, we must also grant, that this direction of attitude, is deter- mined by the greater use, and power of the right- hand muscles, and therefore some influence must be allowed to this cause. This theory has given rise to an absurd practice of anointing the muscles of the contracted side with goose-grease, and such other unguents as are thought to be softening, and relaxing, while the weak muscles of the opposite side are rubbed with spirits and strengthening lini- ments. Some curvatures, to a certain degree at least, must be allowed to depend on attitude. This is proved by the form of many persons who sit much at a desk, nurses who always carry a child on one arm, turners, artists, and others. In these instances the deviation is generally confined to elevation of the right shoulder, and slight uniform curve of the up- per lumbar, and all the dorsal vertebrae, towards the right side. Insane persons who remain constantly in one position, often exhibit deviations in the form of the spine. Lying on one side in bed, with the head raised, has been considered by some a cause of distortion, but this, and all other attitudes, to effect

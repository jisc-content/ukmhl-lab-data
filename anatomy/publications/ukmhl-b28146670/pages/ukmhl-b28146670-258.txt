236 ON THE MECHANICAL APPARATUS various backboards, collars, &c. used in curvatures ot the spine are employed with the same view. Crutches have some advantage over corsets, and collars, inasmuch as they support the weight of the upper part of the body, without confining the mus- cles to total inaction. In walking, crutches should be of sufficient length to allow the extremity of the foot alone to touch the ground, and when attached to a seat, they should be high enough to raise the shoulders in the same manner as in the common mode of using them. The corsets employed in cases of distorted spine are occasionally useful, but much mischief has accrued from their indiscriminate em- ployment. It must be obvious to every one, that where the primary source of distortion, is a debili- tated state of the muscles, instruments which are em- ployed to support the spine, to do, in fact, what the muscles should of themselves effect, so far from re- moving the deformity, will tend to the aggravation of the malady, they may conceal the defect but they never can cure it. Instruments of this kind are use- ful in slight cases of lateral curvature, and in conva- lescence from disease of the fibro-cartilages, in the intervals of exercise, during meals, and to relieve the irksomeness occasioned by long-continued recumben- cy. The cure of the deformity will not be retarded by permitting such change of position, for we must always bear in mind that lateral curvatures before they become permanently established, always disap-

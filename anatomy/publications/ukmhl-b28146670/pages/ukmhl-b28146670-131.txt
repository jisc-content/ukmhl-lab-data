TREATMENT OF VARUS. 109 vated position: the internal ankle, which before was scarcely seen, gradually protrudes as the cure ad- vances : the upper part of the foot loses its project- ing part, and becomes of its regular shape. In the second stage of the treatment, a lever is required to bring the body, and tuberosity of the os calcis more outwards, than can be effected by the horizontal spring, and at the same time to retain the tibia, and fibula, perpendicular to the astragalus. This is effected by a vertical spring, which being fixed to the stirrup, that passes under the sole, and bending outwards from the leg, will, when bound to the upper part of the tibia, bring the whole foot out- wards, and place it in a proper direction, with res- pect to the bones of the leg. This second stage of the treatment, will require double the time of the first: the spring should be gradually increased in intensity, and the apparatus should never be dis- placed, day or night, except during the process of friction.* The child should never complain of pain, if he does, we may be certain the instrument is in fault, the springs are either too powerful, or there is some improper pressure, which will require to be attended to. For about a year after the ces- sation of the treatment, boots should be worn, hav- ing the outer edge of the sole thicker, and more raised than the inner margin. * See figure and description in the last chapter.

OF CURVATURE FORWARDS. 15S sufficient basis posteriorly, these latter bones are then situated at the sides of the chest, and are thus more than usually removed from the spine. Lateral curvature is sometimes complicated with anterior, and then the scapulas are still more deranged. The pelvis is more likely to suffer in those cases, where the disease is in the lower vertebrae : when it is affected, the deviation is in its antero-posterior diameter, not obliquely, as in lateral curvature. In curvature forwards, the inclination of the pelvis with the horizon, is more or less changed, according to the degree and proximity of the distortion. The sacrum suffers more from the influence of the ma- lady, than the other pelvic bones : its superior por- tion is sometimes thrown more backward than usual, thus producing a preternaturally large antero-pos- terior diameter : it is also generally less inclined towards the horizon. In a great degree of angular projection, the promontory of the sacrum is entirely lost, which accounts for the observation, that some women with these deformities have, contrary to ex- pectation, very easy labours. When the distortion has altered the form of the thorax, and reversed the direction of its long dia- meter, the heart is situated at a greater distance from the spine than natural: palpitations, and irregularity of its action are common, and often give rise to unfounded suspicions of the existence of organic disease of this viscus. The form of the lungs will

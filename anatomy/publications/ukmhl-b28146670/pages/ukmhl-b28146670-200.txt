178 OP SPINAL DISTORTION FROM have also a lateral curvature. Such cases of trifling distortion are common, and readily yield to exercise, regulated diet, cold-bathing, and tonics. The mus- cles, by these means, acquire vigour, and re-establish the natural direction of the bones ; the ligaments, being no longer stretched by the pressure of the superincumbent weight, contract to their proper dimensions ; as the elongated ligaments of rope- dancers, &c. return to their wonted length, when the exercises, which caused their unnatural dimen- sions, have been discontinued. Deformities occasionally result from paralysis of certain muscles, or sets of muscles. Debility and wasting of some part, often of a whole limb, will be observed, and this may be followed by distortion of the spine. Cases of this sort are often consecutive, or co-existent with a deranged state of the nutritive or- gans, and readily give way as these organs are restored to health. In some instances such connexion can- not be traced, and we are led to believe that the mischief is seated in the brain or spinal marrow, but in the majority of such cases, the remote cause will be found in the digestive apparatus, the nerves being the medium through which such derange- ment affects, primarily, the muscles, and consecu- tively the spine. In spinal distortion from defective, or irregular action of the muscles, the attention is first excited by the unusual projection of one of the shoulders or

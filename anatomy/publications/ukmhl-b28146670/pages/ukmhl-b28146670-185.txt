OF ANGULAR PROJECTION. 163 to this form of distortion, and but little more re- quires to be added. Angular projection occurs most frequently in the lower dorsal, or upper lumbar vertebrae, foi reasons which have been before stated. The fixed state ot the lower lumbar vertebrae, near the sacrum, enable them to retain their position, without giving way at all, towards the production of a curve, and conse- quently if disease is seated in the bodies of one or more of the neighbouring vertebrae, the change of direction will be abrupt, and an angle will be formed. In these cases the bodies of the vertebrae are entirely removed, for if they are only partially absorbed, a curve is formed, amounting to a larger or smaller segment of a circle, according to the ex- tent of the disease. It is in angular projection, that the most frequent instances of pressure on the spinal marrow occur, producing paralysis of the lower limbs, ol the blad- der, rectum, &c. This effect would appear to be sometimes dependant on the extension of inflamma- tion to, or effusion of some fluid on the medullary sheath. When this deformity occurs in a child, it is almost invariably accounted for by some blow or fall, which would probably never have been thought of, but for the great anxiety which universally prevails, to avoid the imputation of constitutional infirmity. How- ever, it is not improbable, that a fall may be the m 2

LENGTH OF THE LOWER LIMBS. 71 serious deviations of other parts have been esta- blished. It is of course impossible to effect a change in the original vice of formation, but by the adoption of a high heel and sole of sufficient thick- ness, to supply the want of length of the defective limb, we shall prevent that succussion in walking, which induces early fatigue, prevents the child from taking sufficient exercise, and ultimately effects dis- tortion of the spine. Exercise is the best means of strengthening the muscles, but it will always be avoided as much as possible, when it is attended with difficulty and pain: it becofftes comparatively easy, and may be em- ployed with its usual good effects, by the simple means of artificially equalizing the length of the two members. We meet with prejudices against the adoption of this simple measure, which it is quite impossible to account for; it is difficult to imagine any ill effect that can result, while it is incontestible, that in numerous instances it has prevented, and even corrected, lateral deviations of the vertebral column. Inequality in the length of the two lower extre- mity es, sometimes occurs after birth, in consequence of paralysis, which is often dependent on a deranged state of the organs of nutrition. This wasting of one limb in infancy, has been ascribed to teething, it takes place sometimes at the period of weaning, and may be attributed to the difficulty with which

OF LATERAL CURVATURE. 145 plex the mind without instructing it: a very slight inspection of the preparations of these parts in a museum, will explain more than the most laboured description. The distortion of the chest is greater in this, than in the other varieties of curvature, not only from the double or treble inflexions of the spine, but from the rotation which accompanies them. To so great a degree will this rotation occur, in some instances, that the body will be twisted almost to a lateral aspect, and the lower part of the sternum, and ribs, will be suspended above the crest of the ileum of the opposite side. The torsion of the abdomen in these cases, produces such a depres- sion at the epigastrium, that the ordinary effects of the deviation of the lower part of the chest, are very much increased. Although lateral curvatures of the spine, most commonly commence in the lumbar region, this is by no means invariably the case. Occasionally they originate with the dorsal vertebrae, but in whatever part of the column a lateral bend takes place, it is invariably followed, sooner or later, by one or more, in opposite directions. The body is not so much deformed by several of these inflexions, as it would be by one which was considerable, and it may be established as a rule, that the fewer the curvatures, the greater is the deformity. When there are four gentle curves in the spine, giving it a serpentine appearance, the deformity will hardly be perceived, L

186 OF SPINAL DISTORTION FROM for the same purpose, are equally injurious, they relieve the muscles of the back from all exertion, by preventing the possibility of their action, and thus increase the mischief they were intended to remedy. The plan of carrying on the crown of the head a bag of shot, of different weight, according to circumstances, is excellent in these cases, and when sufficiently persevered in, will effect a cure by strengthening the muscles. A cord attached to the head by means of a band, and passing through two pullies, having a weight at its other end, is also employed for this purpose. The head being moved up and down, exercises the muscles of the back, and the weight to be raised should be gradually in- creased as the muscles improve in vigour. In recent cases of lateral distortion, it is still too much the fashion, to increase the stiffness of stays, and to employ steel supports and bandages, which undoubtedly improve the appearance of the figure, and conceal the distortion, but do worse than nothing with respect to the cause of the evil. These means are useful adjuncts to the treatment, they support the spine in the intervals of exercise, and thus re- lieve the irksomeness of long-continued recumbency, but their inefficacy in the cure of deformities, has been sufficiently exposed by their trequent failures. Exercises judiciously applied according to the variety of distortion, the occasional use of collars, and sup- ports for the spine, attention to correct improper

DISEASE OF THE FIBRO-CARTILAGES. 205 pit of the stomach, of twitchings in the muscles of the abdomen and those of the lower extremities, with various anomalous nervous symptoms, depen- dant on pressure of the thickened fibro-cartilage on the spinal marrow, or, more probably, on an exten- sion of inflammation to the medullary sheath. It is somewhat difficult to distinguish, in every instance, the deformities which are respectively caused, by deficiency of muscular power, and dis- ease of the elastic cartilages, but the importance of such distinction is paramount to the difficulty, and therefore we should make a patient investigation in the first instance, before we decide on the mode of treatment. We shall thus avoid the mistake of condemning a person to inactivity, in the horizontal posture, for a debilitated state of the muscles, and we shall not apply local remedies to remove in- flammation, when exercise and activity, are alone required to give tone and energy to the defective muscles. Our first examination should be, to press, one by one, the spinous processes of the whole column, to discover whether pain, or convulsive twitchings? are produced. A second important observation con- sists, in comparing the difference of the stature, night and morning. If the removal of the weight of the body, produced by a recumbent posture, is followed by any very marked increase of height, we may conclude that the tumefaction of the elastic

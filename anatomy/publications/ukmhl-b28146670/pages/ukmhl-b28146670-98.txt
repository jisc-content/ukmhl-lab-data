7() DEFORMITIES FROM MALFORMATION occurs, the head of that femur, which receives the weight of the body, is distinctly seen to rise in the external iliac fossa, the pelvis to sink, and all the signs of displacement to become more apparent on this side, while they sensibly diminish on the other, until this in its turn receives the weight of the body. In the recumbent position, the deformity in great measure disappears, the weight of the body no longer bearing down the pelvis. In this position, we may, by extension, lengthen the limbs from two to three inches, and this can be effected without inducing pain. The diagnosis of this affection is very important, because it has been confounded with scrophulous disease of the hip-joint. Dupuytren states, that he has met with individuals having this malformation, who had been confined to the horizontal position, for years, and had undergone repeated applications of leeches, blisters, cauteries, and even moxas, all of course without the slightest benefit. The absence of all pain, or swelling, of abscess, or cicatrix : the simultaneous existence of deformity, on both sides : the appearance of this vicious formation from the earliest attempt at motion : the progressive develop- ment of the deformity, as the weight of the upper part of the body increases : these are characteristics, which should enable us to distinguish this affection, from one so different, in its origin, nature and treat- ment.

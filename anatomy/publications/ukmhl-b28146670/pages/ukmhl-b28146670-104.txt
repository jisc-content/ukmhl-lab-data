DEFORMITIES FROM MALFORMATION 82 bar vertebrae, when the extension is augmented : and the renewed flexion of the thigh, when the bend of the lumbar region is diminished. There are other cases of lameness about the hip- joint, dependant on defect in the relative length of the muscles of the posterior region of the thigh, in- serted into the tuberosity of the ischium, proceeding from an unusual inclination of the pelvis forwards. In these cases, the extensors of the leg, have more freedom, and the flexion of this part is not impeded : but in those described above, the contrary occurs, and the patient prefers a sitting posture, on very low seats, because he can then keep his lower limbs in that degree of relaxation, which is agreeable. When the patient holds himself upright, the condyles of the femur draw upwards the muscles of the calf, and the heel is raised from the ground : the increased un- dulations of the spine, from the too forward inclina- tion of the pelvis: the alternate angles formed by the thighs and legs, imperfectly extended, and by the foot, the flexion of which is not sufficient: the narrowness of the base of support, being reduced to the space comprehended by the metatarsus and toes : all these circumstances render the erect posture little secure, and progressive motion rapid, unsteady and limping. It is important to distinguish these com- plications, because they are susceptible of cure, while the malformation of the hip-joint, which commonly accompanies them, is not. (Delpech.)

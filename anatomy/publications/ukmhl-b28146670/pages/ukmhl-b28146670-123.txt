101 OF VARUS. muscles of the sole of the foot had preserved their natural appearance and volume, none had passed into the fatty state, except the accessorius to the flexor digitorum communis. The articulating surface of the astragalus with the scaphoides, was singularly diminished in size, as well as most of the articulations among the tarsal bones. Part of the cartilage of the articulating surfaces ol the tibia, and the astragalus was destroyed. The bones of the legs in these cases, are generally straight in young subjects, and even in some adults: in others however, they follow the inclination of the foot. The articulation of the knee is sometimes affected, and the leg deviates from its proper axis, outwards, or inwards ; but this curvature of the leg is consecutive to the distortion of the foot, and we can easily understand, how this will happen in rickety subjects, who walk on the external edge of the foot. The external ankle is thrown outwards, and is increased in volume. The internal ankle is short, as it sawed horizontally near its base: its lower ex- tremity presents a surface, which sometimes articu- lates with the os calcis, and sometimes with the naviculare. The essential character of this distortion is the elbow or angle, which the first range of tarsal bones, forms with the second : the first being on the same line with the leg, the second with the rest ol the foot.

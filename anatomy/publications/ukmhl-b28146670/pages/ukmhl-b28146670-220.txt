198 OP SPINAL DISTORTION FROM them, they act in the same way they always have done, but the healthy condition of the cartilages being destroyed, that re-action which opposed the muscles is lost. While the fibro-cartilages were sound they counteracted the efforts of the muscles, and by their elasticity restored the vertebral column to its proper position, but this elasticity being lost the vertical condition of the spine can be no longer maintained; it gives way to one side, most commonly the right, possibly because the muscles of this side are the most powerful, and the common attitudes for draw- ing, writing, &c. tend to elevate the right shoulder. A slight distortion being established, it continues to increase, not only by the contraction of the muscles, but also by the weight of the body, and a second and third curvature will be established to restore the head and trunk to the centre of gravity. Thus we have a lateral curvature established. In some cases of this malady the spine is curved forwards, and in others there will be a complication of both descrip- tions of distortion. On the subsidence of the in- flammation and tumefaction of the cartilages, and when these substances contract, which they always do after the active stage of the disease has passed away, if the patient has much indulged in the sitting posture, with the body bent forwards, the fibro-car- tilages will be reduced to the shape of a wedge, and an anterior curvature of the spine will be established.

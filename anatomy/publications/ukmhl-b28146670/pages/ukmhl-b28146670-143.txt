121 OF WRY-NECK. in a limited degree, and sometimes this motion ean- not be at all effected: patients so circumstanced, are obliged to turn their whole body, instead of turning their head only, and the constraint thus con- stantly endured, tends to the increase of the con- traction. In some instances, the face looks towards the opposite side to that, where the malady is seated : this will be easily understood, if we contract the left sterno-cleido-mastoideus, and although the neck is drawn to that side, the aspect of the face will be rather directed to the right. The primary cause of this disease is most fre- quently seated in the muscles, especially the sterno- cleido-mastoideus, others may be in some degree implicated, but this is the principal seat of the con- traction. The origin of this muscular contraction, has been attributed to many different circumstances: the habit of holding the head always on one side : being carried by nurses always on one arm, the child supporting its head on the nurseâ€™s shoulder: lying constantly on the same side in bed: these have been considered by different writers, as suffi- cient to shorten the muscles of one side, and to impair the power of their antagonists. But tins inequality in the muscles is most commonly conge- nital, being slight at birth, and increased afterwards by any of the above-mentioned circumstances. This malady is also produced by wounds, or abscesses.

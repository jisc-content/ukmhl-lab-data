GROWTH OF HONE. carried on; their bones are spongy and soft, and often incapable of supporting the weight of their bodies. The process of ossification differs, according to the form of the bone. In the long bones there is one central ring first ossified; the body extends towards either head ; the heads, ossifying each in its centre, extend towards the shaft, but they are not completely united before the twentieth year; about which time the body, heads, and processes, are fi- nally consolidated into one bone. In flat bones, ossification begins at one, or more central points, and the radiating fibres join the radii of other ossi- fying points, or meet the edges of the next bone. The thick round bones of the wrist and tarsus, have each an ossifying point in their centre, which is surrounded by cartilage. The processes of bones are generally distinct ossifications, afterwards united to the bone, in the same manner as the heads. There is no distinction between the heads and bo- dy of the bone, while it is in a cartilaginous state: they appear as separate parts at that stage when the body is ossified, and each of the heads beginning to form, they continue as three distinct bones, during all the early part of life, and are easily separated by maceration. In the original cartilage, there is no cavity ; this begins to appear with ossification : as ossification proceeds in the long bones, a cylinder is formed,

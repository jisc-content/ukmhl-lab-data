OF CURVATURE FORWARDS. 151 sympathetic nerves, follow the course of the spine, and make the same curves. The viscera of the abdomen are also displaced and often compressed, but they suffer less in general, than in curvature for- wards. SECTION II. OF CURVATURE FORWARDS. In this variety of spinal distortion, the upper verte- brae are brought nearer to the lower, and the spine is so curved, that the convexity of the arch is directed backwards and its concavity forwards. It is almost as frequent in occurrence as lateral curvature. It takes place at all ages, but from very different causes. In infants the spine is naturally bent forwards, the alternate curves do not then exist, and it is some months after birth before the dorsal muscles are capa- ble of keeping it erect. In weakly children it is very long before the spine assumes the erect position, and in those of a rickety tendency, at the period when they should walk, their body is doubled forwards, from general muscular debility, or a compressed state of the bodies of the vertebra; this is one of the earliest forms of anterior curvature. During the whole period of growth we meet with cases of this variety of distortion, sometimes the result of rickets, sometimes of chronic inflammation of the

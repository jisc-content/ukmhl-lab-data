DEFECTIVE MUSCULAR ACTION, 179 hips, and a disposition to stand or sit on one side. This observation will lead to an examination of the spine, and we shall generally find it taking a serpen- tine course. The whole of one side, most frequently the right, will be fuller and rounder than natural, while the reverse will be seen on the opposite side. In distortions from this cause, there are no premoni- tory symptoms which would lead to an examination of the spine, before the deviation becomes obvious. There is in most cases little or no pain in the ba.ck, a weary, heavy pain is occasionally complained of, but this sort of feeling is so common during the period of growth, that it is generally unheeded. In the greater number of these cases the lumbar region first yields to the pressure of the parts above, but this will be so slight as to escape observation, until the upper part of the spine is curved in an op- posite direction, by the natural efforts to restore the balance of the body. After some time three distinct curves may be traced. One from the pelvis to the lower dorsal vertebrae, a second in an opposite direc- tion, to the upper dorsal, and a third in the cervical region, to bring the head into its proper axis. The thorax will be more or less distorted, one side of the chest being obviously increased, and the other diminished in size, but the ribs in recent cases are not materially altered in form. Indeed it may be laid down as an established principle, that in all distortions, whether of the limbs, or of the spine, n 2

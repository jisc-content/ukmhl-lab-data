OF THE MUSCLES. 22 the flexors greatly preponderate. This accounts for the greater number of deformities in the sense of flexion : for one case of valgus, that variety of club- foot, in which the extensors of the leg draw the dorsum outwards and upwards, we meet with a hundred of varus, in which the foot is drawn in- wards by the flexors. The presence of arterial blood is essential to mus- cular contraction ; the more healthy,the more highly aerified it is, the greater is the vigour of the muscles. Thus birds, having blood abundantly charged with oxygen, from their extended respiration, possess great muscular energy. Frigate birds have been seen on the ocean, at a distance of five hundred miles from any land or rock, and many remarkable facts, con- nected with the muscular power of birds, must be familiar to all. Insects have even greater muscular energy than birds, which may arise from the exten- sion of their respiratory organs : it is well known that the bodies of insects are entirely permeated with the ramifications of their tracheae, so that the air penetrates every part like the pores of a sponge. On the contrary, animals with respiratory organs of inferior development, have much less powerful mus- cular contractility. The lungs of tortoises are mere vesicles : their blood is very imperfectly oxygenated, and the torpidity of the whole class of the animal kingdom, to which they belong, is implied by the name reptilia.

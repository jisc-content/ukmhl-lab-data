\4 STRUCTURE! OF THE! vertebra. There are twenty-four of these small bones : they support the whole weight of the head, arms, and trunk ; by their combined motion, the turnings and bendings of the body are principally performed ; and in their centre is a canal, contain- ing that elongation ot the brain, which distributes, through the medium of the nerves, sensation and motion to most parts of the body. There are seven vertebrae of the neck, twelve of the back, and five of the loins. The bodies of the lowest vertebrae are large and broad, they gradually decrease in size up to the neck, and the whole forms a lengthened pyramid. The lumbar vertebrae have large bodies and thick interstitial cartilages, their processes afford space for the attachment of very powerful muscles, they bear the whole weight, and perform the chief motions of the body. The ver- tebrae of the back have smaller interstitial cartilages, their spinous processes fall one over the other, their articulations are very limited, each rib is attached to the body of one, and the transverse process of the next dorsal vertebrae ; so that Nature has here much restricted motion. The vertebrae of the neck, hav- ing less weight to support, have smaller bodies, and their articulations permit considerable motion. The first and second cervical vertebrae differ much from the rest, there is no fibro-cartilage between them, the second has a vertical process designed for the rotatory motions of the head, the articulation be-

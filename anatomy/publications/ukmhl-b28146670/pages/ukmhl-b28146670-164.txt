OF LATERAL CURVATURE-. 142 There is a provision in the lower extremity by which the leg can be extended, and the weight of the body rest on the ligamentous connexions, without much muscular effort.* It is that position into which a soldier throws himself when commanded to stand at ease. One leg is gently bent, the other is extended and supports the whole weight of the body: the lumbar vertebrae bend towards tbe opposite side to that of the extended leg, while the dorsal vertebrae are drawn in a contrary direction, to maintain the equilibrium ; this is precisely the case, in the com- mon form of lateral distortion of the spine. As the leg on which the body rests is changed, the curves of the spine change : when the body rests on the left leg, the right shoulder is the most elevated. A weakly girl will often indulge in this position, almost always on the left leg, and the left haunch will project, or as it is usually described to us “ grows out.” To balance the body, the trunk is * This circumstance was first pointed out by Mr. C. Bell. It is similar to the contrivance in the leg’s of birds, by which, in roost- ing1, they are enabled to grasp the perch without any muscular effort, but by the mere weight of their body. When a soldier is ordered to stand at ease, he instantly places himself in such a position, that the centre of gravity of the trunk falls in the back part of the pelvis, the weight of the body renders tense the mus- cles and fascia passing from the superior spinous process of the ileum to the patella: the bones of the leg become perpendicular to the arch of the foot, and the erect position is maintained with very little muscular effort.

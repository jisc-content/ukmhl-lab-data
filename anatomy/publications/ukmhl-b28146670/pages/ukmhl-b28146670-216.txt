( 1<>4 ) CHAPTER X. Of Disease of the Fibro- Cartilages, as a Cause of Spinal Distortion. In the disease which I am about to describe, the intervertebral fibro-cartilages undergo a peculiar change, they become tumid and soft by an altera- tion of their tissue, or an infiltration into its texture, of a jelly-like matter. This alfection of the cartilages, is frequently confounded with that of the bones, described by Pott: the two diseases are often allied to scrophula: caries of the bones is sometimes a consequence of diseased cartilage, while ulceration of the cartilages in other instances, is the effect of carious vertebra*. The best account of this diseased state of the cartilages is given by Delpech: Dr. Jarrold of Manchester has also described a similar affection. The subject, however, is still enveloped in much obscurity, and it is extremely difficult, especially in the early stages, to distinguish disease of the fibro-cartilages from that of the vertebrae. This malady is very insidious in its approaches, in its early stages it is often unnoticed, or the symp- toms are referred to disturbance of other organs. It

152 OF CURVATURE FORWARDS. fibr o-cartilages, and at others of muscular debility. It occurs at all ages from disease of the bodies of the vertebrae, but more rarely after 40. The bent back of rheumatic and old persons are forms of anterior curvature familiar to all. In this kind of deformity, a few vertebrae only may be affected forming a slight projection backwards, or a larger number being implicated, will produce a more extensive curve, or the whole spine may lose its normal form, and become one great arch. The rotation of the vertebral column on its axis, is less frequent than in lateral curvature. When the malady depends on muscular debility, the curvature will be most extensive: when it results from intumescence of the fibro-cartilages, there will be first a projection of only one or two spinous pro- cesses, but the disease will soon extend above and below the original seat, and if not arrested very considerable curvature will ensue. In cases arising from the disease of bone, fewer vertebrae are con- cerned, and we consequently have, from this cause, rather an angular projection, than a curvature. In many instances, where muscular debility is the principal cause, there have been no symptoms lead- ing to any suspicion of approaching mischief, but as in lateral curvature from the same cause, the incipi- ent deformity will first draw attention to the spine. Even where there is disease in the fibro-cartilages, pr the bones, the pain is often so obscure, that the

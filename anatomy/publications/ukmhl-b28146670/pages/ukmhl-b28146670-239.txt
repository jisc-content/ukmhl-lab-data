Numerous facts prove the occurrence of paralysis in this dis- ease without any distortion of the spine. The in- creased thickness of the fibro-cartilages may in some cases partially press on the spinal marrow. Prepa- rations of vertebrae exist where the whole interver- tebral substance has been removed, and the bones anchylosed, without any elevation of the spinous processes and consequently without deformity.â€” Many instances of this kind are recorded, where paralysis occurred without distortion. Some of the persons suffering from this disease, are totally incapable of walking at a very early period of it: others can do so by the help of crutches, or by grasping their thighs: some can sit in a chair, which others are incapable of doing:, some have a certain degree of command over their legs, and can move them in bed, while others are totally dependant on assistants, for every change of position.

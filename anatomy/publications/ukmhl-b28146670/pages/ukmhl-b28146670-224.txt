202 OF SPINAL DISTORTION FROM avoid bending the body in any direction, and the expedients made use of when they cannot avoid it, are often remarkable. In walking they will stumble frequently, and feel pain in the back, which pain ceases as suddenly as it occurred, and of which the patient cannot always indicate the seat with preci- sion. If pressure be made on the spinous processes of each vertebra in succession, pain will be felt in one or more points, and sometimes an almost epilep- tic seizure will be experienced, accompanied with convulsive actions of the upper and lower limbs. If this examination be made while the patient is stand- ing, he will sometimes fall down at the moment when the pressure is made. Spinal curvatures from this cause, are most readily multiplied, on account of the unusual mobility, which the tumefaction, and softness of the fibro-cartilages, produces in the vertebral column. It is important to ascertain all the inflections of the spine, in order to meet them by proper modes of treatment, but it is often difficult to make out the whole extent of the malady. Curvatures backward are long before they are remarked, are difficult to distinguish, because the spinous processes and the posterior plates of the ver- tebrae, prevent such deformities from becoming ex- treme. Very particular attention is required, to detect the existence of a concave point, in the pos- terior region of the spine : we should bend the body forwards, and we may then discover if there is any

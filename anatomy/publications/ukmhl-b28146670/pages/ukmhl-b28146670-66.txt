Anatomists in this country agree that there is no enlargement of the bone, but that it is rendered soft and spongy- All the morbid specimens I have myself examined, shew no enlargement of the ends of the bones, but rather the reverse, for the whole of the long bones are diminished in size. However, we seldom have an opportunity of examining such subjects in an early stage of the disease, when there is thickening, at least, on the surface of the bones; for the appa-

133 ON SriNAL DISTORTIONS. disease of the cartilages, or the bones: that degree of it, which has been denominated angular projec- tion, is almost invariably permanent, and depends on progressive, or ulcerative absorption, of the fibio- cartilages, or of the bones. The spine cannot be deformed in the dorsal region, without implicating the situation, and relations of the sternum, and the ribs : the rotation or contortion which is generally more or less combined with cur- vature, will also secondarily alter the form of the ribs and sternurfT. The mode of the posterior arti- culation of the ribs, hardly permits them to escape in any degree of dorsal curvature, unless the liga- ments become greatly relaxed : to a certain extent this may occur, but at a later period of inflexion of the dorsal vertebras, the ribs corresponding to the concavity of the curve, will be necessarily brought nearer together, while those of the convex side will be separated, and on the degree of resistance offered by the ligaments and cartilages, will depend the amount of distortion of the chest. The varieties of. this are innumerable, as may be seen in any anato- mical museum. In old subjects we often meet with bony con- cretions between the vertebrae; this is also very common in old quadrupeds, many of those dying in menageries have the entire vertebral column formed of one solid piece, and it is the principal cause of that rigidity of the back, and want of ease in the

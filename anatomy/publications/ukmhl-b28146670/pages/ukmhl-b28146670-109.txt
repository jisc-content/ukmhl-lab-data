OF THE KNEE-JOINT. 87 distortions of the knee, as of many other parts. An example of this occasionally happens, when the cross ligaments being disposed to yield, their elon- gation is augmented by the extreme weakness of all the muscles: from whence, a remarkable inflexion of the leg forwards, and the formation of an angle, at the anterior region of the knee, results. In other examples from this cause, in consequence of the relaxation being principally seated in the lateral lioâ€™aments, the more common form of distortion takes place, and the leg is directed outwards. This tendency of the leg outwards is a remarkable circumstance. In' anchylosis after white-swelling, and other diseases of the joint, where the malady has deteriorated the consistence of the ligaments, the leg is first inclined outwards, and is then con- tracted in the sense of flexion. The apparent projection of the internal condyle of the femur inwards, resulting from the inclination of the leg outwards, has been the source of contro- versy with regard to the reality, or the mere sem- blance of swelling, in the heads of the bones inter- ested in white-swelling: but the best authorities, uniformly agree that, in these cases, there is no bony enlargement. This deformity, if neglected, will continue to in- crease, until the ligaments acquire density enough, to bear the entire weight ol the body, and to resist farther extension. The degree of deformity, where

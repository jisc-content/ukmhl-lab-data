â€¢td OF THE FORMATION AND 9 posited in the cartilage, and is arranged in it by fibres, which extend from one, or many common centres, in each bone. The fibres are divergent in flat bones, and parallel in long ones. As a general rule, it may be said, that the organization of those parts, is most promptly finished, which are first called into use: thus, the bones of the ear, are perfect at birth, in all animals. The tissue of the bones differs in different animals ; it is fine in man, more gross in quadrupeds, relaxed and rude in the cetacea, thin, firm, and elastic in birds. Marine animals, as seals, cetacea and tor- toises, have no medullary cavity in their bones, whilst the cavities in the bones of birds are large, but without marrow. The bones are soft and flexible, in young animals, acquire hardness and rigidity, as growth ceases, and become fragile in old age. Cartilaginous fishes, as rays, sharks, &c. are said to grow all their life, no stop being put to their extension, by the solidity of the skeleton, as in other animals. The slower the process of ossification in an animal, the longer is the period of its growth and life, since, as the organi- zation becomes rigid, the vital functions are carried on with increasing difficulty. The degree of hardness, is greater in some bones than in others, and varies in the different parts of the same bone. Where it is considerable, there is more of earthy matter, and more of animal sub-

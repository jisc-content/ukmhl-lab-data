20 OF THE MUSCLES. vessel of water, when the surface will be found to sink. There is always an exact relation between a joint and the muscles which move it. Whatever mo- tion the joint, by its mechanical construction, is capable of performing, that motion, and that only, are the annexed muscles capable of producing. For example, if there be, as at the knee and elbow, a hinge-joint, the muscles and tendons are placed in directions parallel to the bones, so as to produce that kind of motion and no other. Whereas, at the shoulder and the hip, where the ball and socket- joint allows a rotatory motion, muscles are placed in such positions, and pull in such directions, as to effect that motion which the joint admits. In the head and fore-arm, there is a specific mechanism in the bones for rotatory motion ; and we accordingly find, in the oblique direction of the muscles belong- ing to them, a specific provision for putting this mechanism of the bones into action. The oblique muscles would have been inefficient, without that particular articulation, and that particular articula- tion, would have been useless without the appropriate disposition of the muscles. It often happens that the action of muscles is required in situations, where their bulk would have been inconvenient. In such cases, the body of the muscle is placed at some distance, and communi-

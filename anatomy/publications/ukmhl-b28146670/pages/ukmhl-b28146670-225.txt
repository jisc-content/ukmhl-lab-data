DISEASE OF THE FIBRO-CARTILAGES. 203 break in the great arch, which the spine should form in that position. Some lateral distortions from thickening and softening of the fibro-cartilages are very complicated; not only does the alternate play of the muscles, to establish the equilibrium, singularly vary and multi- ply the inflections of the vertebrae, but an unequal thickness in any one or more of the intervertebral spaces, may at that point produce a deviation in an opposite direction to the rest of the curvature.â€” Delpech states, that he has met with five or six op- posite curvatures in cases of this nature, which he attributes to the circumstance of some of the fibro- cartilages being more diseased than others ; and the corresponding vertebra? are consequently forced by pressure in an opposite direction to the rest. In- curvations of this kind in the upper part of the dor- sal region, are often difficult to detect, because, if they are not very considerable, they are easily con- cealed under the displaced shoulder-blades. Although produced in the first instance by tume- faction of the fibro-cartilages, long-continued defor- mity from this cause, induces atrophy of these same parts, and the pressure will then be directly on the bone. Amongst the distorted spines, preserved in museums, will be found many specimens exhibiting this absorption of the intervertebral substance, the vertebrie being in juxta-position with little or no alteration in their form.

104 OF VALGUS. of the peculiarities in the form and position of the tarsal bones in these cases, depend on circumstances which have operated after birth. Plate 2 represents the bones of the foot in a case of varus: we see that in this case, the chief cause of the alteration in the form of the foot consists in the removal of the scaphoides from its articulation with the astragalus. The cuboides is also turned on its smaller axis, and leaves exposed part of the an- terior articulating surface of the calcaneum : there is a kind of fossa formed between these two bones. The astragalus very nearly retains its proper position with regard to the tibia and fibula, its head being denuded by the turning of the naviculare, causes a protuberance. Fig. 2 is a back view of the same foot. OF VALGUS. In this variety the foot is turned outwards : a very flat foot is a specimen of this malformation in a slight degree : bad cases are occasionally seen, where the dorsum of the foot is applied to the outer and anterior part of the leg. In these distortions the heel touches the ground first, and in some instances no other part of the foot; the astragalus being thrown behind the tibia, gives a lengthened appearance to fhe foot. I can find no anatomical description ol the changes produced among the tarsal bones by this

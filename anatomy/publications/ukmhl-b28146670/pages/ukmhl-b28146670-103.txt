OF THK HIP-JOINT. SI or backwarder, more within or more without, than in the natural position of the part. These deviations are generally caused by rickets, and we meet vrith innumerable varieties of form in the cotyloid cavities of rickety pelves, preserved in every anatomical museum. All these deformities, are accompanied with more or less deviation of the spinal column. In these often obscure cases of lameness about the hip-joint, it is important to examine with great care, the form of the pelvis, and the dimensions of its parts, as well as those of the lower extremities, their mobility, &c. in order to obtain a correct notion of the origin of the mischief, which may depend on many different causes, among which some are to be remedied. Lameness similar to that, dependant on want of conformity, between the articulating surfaces of the hip-joint, is sometimes produced by unnatural short- ness of the psoas magnus, and iliacus internus, mus- cles : the effect of which, is to hold the pelvis inclined forwards, to increase the natural curve of the lumbar vertebrae, to prevent complete extension of the lower extremities, and to cause that alternate balancing of the body, which is characteristic of deformities, about the ilio-femoral articulation. These cases are to be distinguished, by the impossibility of bending the thighs, beyond a certain point: by the elastic nature of the resistance, opposing this motion : by the increased inclination forwards of the lower lum- G

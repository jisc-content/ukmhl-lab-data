132 GENERAL OBSERVATIONS fusion has arisen from the use of the same terms, in different senses : the term excurvation, or curvature outwards, has been applied to the common variety of hump back, where the upper part of the spine is unquestionably bent forwards. I shall make use of no other terms than curvature forwards, and curva- ture backwards r by the first will be understood all cases where the upper part of the spine is bent an- teriorly, by which the sternum is brought nearer to the pelvis than natural : by the latter term will be meant the reverse of this, which, indeed, is so rare a case, that it will require but little consideration. In lateral curvatures, the whole spine is more or less distorted : in whatever part the vertebra may first incline to either side, there will be, above or below, one or more curves in opposite directions, to maintain the equilibrium : and in some instances-, the head will be so correctly placed over the centre of gravity, that the body will appear at first sight to be only shortened, and not distorted. Sometimes the whole of the dorsal vertebra are included in one great sweep. This variety is generally dependant on muscular debility, and like all distortions from this cause, is temporary in its incipient stage, disap^ pearing in the recumbent position, and by gentle extension; nor do such cases become truly perma- nent, until from very long continuance, the bones or fibro-cartilages are rendered cuneiform by pressure. Curvature forwards is most commonly dependant on

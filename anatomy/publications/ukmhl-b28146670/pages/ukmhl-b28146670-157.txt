ON SPINAL DISTORTIONS. \S5 that if this bone has lost none of its consistence, if it has not been drawn backwards, the cavity is little diminished, and the contained organs but little im- peded. Curvature of the spine backwards is of much greater importance, but happily it is more rare than any other form. In these cases, other curvatures either simply forwards, or on one or both sides, are soon produced. A strong pressure consequently takes place on the extremities of the sternum, and this force, combined with the different tractions of the ribs, produces a proportional inflection of that bone: generally a curve of which the concavity is directed forwards. There will then be projection both of the spine and the sternum, in the interior of the chest, and the constraint of the contained organs may be easily imagined.* Dyspnoea occurs in distortions, from the irregular disposition of the bones of the chest. In inspira- tion, the cavity cannot be dilated to its usual capa- city, in its lateral or perpendicular diameter, be- cause the shortened intercostals cannot elevate the ribs to a proper extent, and the impeded action of the diaphragm, prevents it from depressing the ab- dominal viscera, so low as usual. From the incli- nation of the body forwards, the abdominal muscles, in expiration, cannot so completely effect a diminu- * Delpech.

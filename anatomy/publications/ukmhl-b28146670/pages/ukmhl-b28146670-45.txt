The phlegmatic and lymphatic, among men and animals present muscles which are soft, flaccid, and pale ; their motions are slow, heavy, feeble, and they are incapable of any great exertions. On the contrary, persons of bilious and athletic constitutions, exhibit muscles greatly developed, hard, of a brown colour, quick and vigo- rous in motion. The sanguine temperament is re- markable for vivacity of motion and facility of exci- tation, but at the same time is very inconstant and variable. This is the general character of women and children, the sanguineous temperament predo- minating with them, while the bilious more especi- ally applies to adult male animals. But the theory of the temperaments cannot be reduced to certain rules ; the same individual at different periods of his life exhibiting the characteristics of each. The circumstances in which we are placed in society, so mingle our natural elements, that a perfect type of any one of the temperaments can hardly be found ; however, in almost every individual, the charac- teristics of some one will predominate, and it is by careful observation, and nice discrimination of the various constitutions of men, that the enlightened practitioner is directed in his treatment of disease. Irritability or contractility, are terms used by dif- ferent physiologists, to denote that inherent property peculiar to the living muscular fibre, by which it

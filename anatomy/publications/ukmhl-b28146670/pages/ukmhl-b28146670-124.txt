J02 OF VARUS. If we examine the phalanges of the toes, the metatarsal, and even the three cuneiform bones, we find that they are only changed in direction, and not altered in form. The scaphoides, says Scarpa, of all the bones of the tarsus, is subjected to the great- est deviation : in the dissections of Cruveilheir, this is not so apparent, and he considers the defects of this bone as consecutive. It is diminished in volume, in consequence of the compression to which it is subjected, and by the displacement of the astragalus : the articulating surface of this bone, with the navi- culare, being reduced to a half or a quarter of its usual extent. Similar remarks apply to the cuboides, the articulating surfaces of which are equally de- ranged. The astragalus, according to Cruveilheir, suffers more than any of the other tarsal bones: in this bone there is not only a change of direction, but also of figure: its deformity is exactly proportioned to the degree of club-foot. This bone is sometimes diminished in volume, and always deformed : its external articulating surface looks downwards, the internal is directed upwards. The articulating car- tilage of its superior surface, is partially destroyed in some, and wholly in other cases. The head of the astragalus is reduced to two-thirds or less, and a large part of it having abandoned the cavity of the scaphoides, is placed under the skin, forming a tumor more voluminous, as the displacement is more

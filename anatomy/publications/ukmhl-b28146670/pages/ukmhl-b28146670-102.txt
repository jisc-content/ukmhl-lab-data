80 DEFORMITIES FROM MALFORMATION birth : he says, that the foetus maintains a position in the uterus, which is likely so to strain a point of the capsular ligament, or a point of the edge of the acetabulum, by the constant pressure of the head of the femur, as to render dislocation probable. But it is difficult to conceive an accident, which shall displace both thighs at the same time, during the intra-uterine life. Others, attribute these congeni- tal deviations, to some original defect of formation, (in the words of Geoflroy St. Hilaire,) to some acci- dent which has disconcerted the order of the em- bryonic evolution. May not some of these cases, be caused by rickets before, or immediately after birth ? Attention is seldom called to them, before the inability of the child to stand, is discovered, and during the preceding months, numerous causes, rickets among the number, may have operated in the production of these deformities. Cruveilheir, in his “Anatomic Pathologique” gives the figure and description of a foetus, in which this and various other malformations were found. The coexistence of several connate defects, favours the opinion that such cases depend on some primordial disturbance in the evolution of the embryo. I have alluded 'more fully to this extraordinary foetus, in the chapter on Club-foot. Other distortions, producing lameness of one or * both sides, sometimes depend on the malposition of the acetabula, which may be situated forwarder

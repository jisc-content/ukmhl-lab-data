OF SPINAL DISTORTION FROM IBS any means brought nearer together than natural, the opposite force, which should hold them at a proper distance, being lost, the muscles, or ligaments, so circumstanced will contract and continue to do so: but separate their points of insertion, keep up a proper degree of extension, and the shortened fibres will gradually recover their normal length. This principle has long been acted upon, in the treatment of club-feet, and contracted joints. So long as anchylosis is incomplete, and the rigidity depends on contraction of muscles or ligaments, we know that, by extension and exercise we can overcome it; in true anchylosis, dependant on union of bone, remedial attempts would be worse than useless. These observations equally appty to curvatures of the spine; while there is no bony anchylosis, we may confidently anticipate a perfect restoration. In the application of machinery to the spine, the danger to be feared, is injury to the spinal marrow, but such accidents can never happen with common care. In the process of hanging, death is produced by suffocation, and cases have occurred where, by some means, the trachea has escaped compression, and a person has survived an hourâ€™s hanging, although the weight of the lower parts of the body must have considerably stretched the vertebral column. The employment of machinery to extend the spine, is the great secret of cure, in bad cases of

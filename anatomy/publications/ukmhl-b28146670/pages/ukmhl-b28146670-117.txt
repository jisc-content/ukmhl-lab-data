95 OF CLUB-FOOT. development, or an arrest of the organic evolution, causing a primitive malposition of the feet. Probably there is some early disturbance of the embryo, which deranges the process of organization, and obliges it to take an unnatural position. Cruveilheir, in his “ Anatomie Pathologique,” gives a plate of a deformed foetus, in which the feet, and hands, are all distorted. He supposes these defects to have been produced by compression, which pre- vented the members from being developed in their natural direction. This pressure, he says, cannot depend on the action of the uterus, from deficiency of the liquer amnii, for many children are born per- fect where this was not abundant, and others are born with club-feet where there has been a deluge of water. Neither can it result from external pres- sure or blows, for many women receive blows, and among those, who from peculiar circumstances, con- ceal their pregnancy by tight lacing, there is not a larger proportion of children, with these malforma- tions. Cruveilheir gives it as his opinion, that the causes of the compression is in the foetus itself. In the remarkable instance which he describes, the legs, instead of being bent upon the thighs, were extended and applied to the anterior part of the trunk, the feet being doubled under the chin, and bent inwards on the tibia to accommodate them- selves to their position. The two feet differed in deformity, as the compression differed on the two sides. In this case, however, it must be observed,

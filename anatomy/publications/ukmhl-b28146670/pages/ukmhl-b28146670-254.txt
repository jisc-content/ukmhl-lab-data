232 ON THE MECHANICAL APPARATUS it is fit to lay and stretch forth the patient upon a table, with his face downwards, and straitly to bind him about with towels under his arm-pits, and about the flanks and thighs. And then to draw and ex- tend as much as we can, upwards and downwards, yet without violence: for unless such extension be made, restitution is not to be hoped for, by reason of the processes and hollowed cavities of the verte- bra, whereby, for the faster knitting, they mutually receive each other. Then must you lie with your hands on the extuberancies, and force in the promi- nent vertebra. But if it cannot be thus restored, then it will be convenient to wrap two pieces of wood, of four fingers long, and one thick, more or less, in linen cloth, and so to apply one on each side of the dislocated vertebra, and so with your hand to press them against the bunching forth vertebra, until you force them back into their seats, just after the manner you see before delineated. â€œ In the mean while have a care, that you touch not the processes which stand up in the ridge ot the spine, for they are easily broken. You may know that the vertebra are restored by the equal smoothness of the whole spine. It is fit after you have restored it to bind up the part, and lay splints or plates of lead neatly made for that purpose upon it: but so, that they may not press the crists, or middle processes of the vertebra, which I formerly mentioned, but only the sides: then the patient

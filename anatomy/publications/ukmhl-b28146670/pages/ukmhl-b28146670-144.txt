Burns or other ac- cidents, causing contraction of the skin, and subja- cent tissue, also produce this deformity. Malfor- mation or disease of the bones, may produce this distortion, but I have not been able to discover any account of such a case; the bones become impli- cated when the deformity has been of long duration, and anchylosis sometimes takes place among the cervical vertebrae. Before applying our remedial means we should clearly ascertain, whether the original cause of the disease was in the skin or muscles, whether the malady was congenital, or subsequent to birth, and whether any degree of anchylosis has yet taken place. In all cases the rotatory motion of the head is very limited, and effected with difficulty and pain, but when anchylosis has been established it is alto- gether impossible. Where the deformity depends on short or con- tracted muscles, it may be cured on the principle of continued extension, which we have so often had occasion to mention. A machine which will gra- dually extend the defective muscles, and at the same time allow motion to the head, will be the only efficient method of treatment. In contractions of the skin from cicatrices, al- though operations are generally unsuccessful, and

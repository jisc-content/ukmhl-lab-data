37 Section ll.-^THE PATEOLOGIGAL CONDITIONS. CHAPTER VI. THE PLEUKA PULMONUM IN ACUTE AND CHKONIO INFLAMMATION. • In the First Part of tliis work it lias been mentioned that the endothelium of the serous membranes is at certain places in a germinating condition, and that this is to a great extent increased in chronic inflammation; and further, it has been stated that similar changes occur also ' in acute inflammation. Similar inflammatory- changes may be observed on the endothelium covering the pulmonary plem"a. I have had the opportunity of examining the endothelium of the pulmonary pleura in a good many cases of acute and chronic pleuritis in rats, rabbits, and guinea-pigs. The inflammation was produced by injecting into the pleural cavity septic pus, or peritoneal fluid of dogs or guinea-pigs that had died in coasequence of pyaemia. The fluid was introduced into the pleural cavity either by means of a Pravaz syringe, or, as is more preferable, by means of a capillary tube of thick glass; in the latter case, the end which is to be inserted into the pleural cavity is drawn out into a short thin canula with blunt point. To insert this canula or that of a Pravaz syringe I proceed in the following manner:—By a very short incision into the skin next to the sternum in the region of the fourth or fifth intercostal space of the right side, the intercostal muscle can be easily reached; this is then perforated by the point of the canula in an oblique direction, so that its point is directed towards the head of tlie animal; after the canula has been pushed forward, always

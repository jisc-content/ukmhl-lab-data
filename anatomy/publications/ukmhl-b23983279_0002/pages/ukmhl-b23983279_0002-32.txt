20 ANATOMY OF THE LYMPHATIC SYSTEM. CHAPTER IV. THE LYMPHATIC SYSTEM OF THE BKONCHI. According- to F. E. Schulze,'^ numerous lymphatics take their origin in the internal layer of the bronchi, and having passed through the external connective-tissue adventitia, run towards the root of the lung, where they enter the bronchial glands. Sikorsky examined the lymphatics of the bronchi of cats and dogs, into whose air-passages a watery solution of carminate of ammonia had been introduced during life. On microscopical examination, the carmine has been found to be present only in the lymphatic system, and hence it was possible to trace the lymphatic vessels up to their minutest branches. Thus he found that there exist, between the columnar epithelial cells of the bronchial mucous membrane, peculiar structures, on superficial aspect resembling columnar epithelial cells, which take up very readily the carmine, whereas the ordinary epithelial cells do not become stained by it. These interepithelial structures are in connec- tion with fine canals, which run perpendicularly into the depth of the bronchial mucous membrane. Partly in the proper mucosa, but chiefly in the sub-mucosa, they form a dense network of anastomosing canals, from which the lymphatic trunks take their origin. These latter are situated in the sub-mucosa, and accompany the bronchi towards the root of the lung. We will first examine the large lymphatic vessels of the bronchi. In the large, as well as in the middle-sized bronchi, numerous lymph- atic vessels are found in the connective tissue adventitia. Here they form a network, the individual vessels having for the most part a course parallel to the long axis of the bronchus. With these lymph- atics, other vessels are seen to anastomose, which latter emerge

The muscular cells show distinct fibrillation of their substance. Hartnack, Oc. III. Obj. 8. Fig. 4. Matrix of connective-tissue bundles of pleura pulmonis of a guinea-pig suffering from chronic pleuritis. Surface-view, showing the arrangement of the connective-tissue bundles and the interfascicular spaces, i.e. lymph-canalicular system, containing the flattened connective- tissue corpuscles. Oc. III. Obj. 10, a immersion. Fig. 5. Longitudinal section through a small bronchus of a guinea-pig's lung. a. Ciliated epithelium. I). Circular coat of unstriped muscles, ti'ansversely cut. c. Lymphatic follicles belonging to the wall of lymphalic vessels, d. e. Branch of pulmonary artery. /. Lymphatic vessels. g. The same filled with granular material (coagulated plasm). In some of the lymphatic vessels clusters of lymph-corpuscles are to be found. Oc. III. Obj. 5. PLATE II. Fig. 6. Surface-view of sub-pleural lymphatic vessels of guinea-pig injected with Berlin blue. a. Large trunk provided with valves. b. Branches which emerge from the dejith, i.e. from the inter- alveolar tissue. Oc. III. Obj. 4. Fio. 7. Surface-view of lymphatic vessels of lung of guinea-pig suffering from artificial tuberculosis, produced by injection of cheesy material into the pleural cavity. a. Branches of the sub-pleural plexus of lymphatic vessels. b. Interalveolar branches. The whole system is filled with lymph-corpuscles; in some places, how^ever, the vessel is in the state of being converted into a chord of adenoid tissue;

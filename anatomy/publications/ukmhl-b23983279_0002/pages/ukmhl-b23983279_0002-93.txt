EXPLANATIOi^T OF PLATES. PLATE I. Fig. 1.^ A. Surface-view of endothelium of the pulmonary pleura of rabbit, in the condition of chronic pleuritis. a. General flattened endothelium. I. Germinating endothelium round stomata, tliese latter being plugged up by fibrinous material, stained dark by nitrate of silver. B. Surface-view of endothelium of the pulmonary pleura of a guinea-pig suffering from chronic pleuritis (due to artificial tuberculosis produced by injection of cheesy material iato the pleural cavity). The endothehal cells being almost columnar, seem, when viewed from above, to be only loosely connected, in consequence of their tops being rounded; many cells have two nuclei or a constricted nucleus. C. Surface-view of the same endothelium of a normal guinea-pig, the lung of which was in a collapsed condition. D. The same seen in profile. Hartnack, Oc. III. Obj. 7. Fig. 2. A. Meshwork of nnstriped muscles in the pleura pulmonis of a guinea-pig suffering from chronic pleuritis. a. Intermuscular lymph-sinuses, lined by a single layer of endo- thelial plates. I. Muscular trabeculse (silver preparation). B. The same muscle in the normal pleura pulmonis (silver prepara- tion). Hartnack, Oc. III. Obj. 7. G

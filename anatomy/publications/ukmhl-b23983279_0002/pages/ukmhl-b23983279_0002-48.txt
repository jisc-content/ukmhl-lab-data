36 ANATOMY OF THE LYMPHATIC SYSTEM. are lined by, the connective-tissue coi'iiuscles, with this difference, that in the former the connective-tissue corpuscles are more like ordinary branched cell-plates, while in the latter they form more a continuous endothelium. The lymphatic vessels originating from these radicles are provided with a special endothelial v/all, and form in the adventitia of the bronchi a network—peribronchial lymph- aticd. These are in communication with the larger trunks of the perivascular lymphatics ; the efferent vessels of both are identical. The third system of radicles, viz. those in the pulmonary pleura, are also interfascicular lacunse communicating with one another by a few canals; each lacuna is lined by a connective-tissue cell-plate. In the guinea-pig's lung there is in addition a system of oblong lymph-spaces formed by the bundles of unstriped muscular tissue— intermuscular lymph-spaces. Both discharge themselves into the subpleural lymphatics. In the lung of guinea-pigs and rabbits the wall of the bronchi contains lymphatic follicles in connection with the wall of the peri- bronchial lymphatic vessels. The subpleural lymphatic vessels stand in a direct open com- mimication with the pleural cavity by means of stomata. The radicles of both the perivascular and peribronchial lymphatics stand in an indirect communication with the alveolar cavities or the surface of the bronchial mucous membrane respectively, by means pseudostomata.

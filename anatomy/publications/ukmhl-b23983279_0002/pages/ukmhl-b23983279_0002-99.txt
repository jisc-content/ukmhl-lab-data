87 EXPLANATION OF PLATES. Fia. 23. From the same lung as fig. 22. • a. Branch of pulmonary artery in transverse section. h. Pulmonary vein. c. Tuberculous nodule. d. Tuberculous cords. Both latter contain carbon particles. Oc. II. Obj. 4. PLATE VI. Fig. 24. From the same lung as figs. 22 and 23. a. A branch of pulmonary artery, not filled out by the injection. The endothehum of the artery is very distinct. I. Capillary blood-vessels surrounding the alveoli. c. Perivascular adenoid tissue, representing the tuberculous cord. d. Epithelium hning the alveoli; at e the epithehal ceUs are giant cells, taking their origin by the fusion of several epi- thelial cells, changed during the inflammation. There are however, other multinuclear cells which take their origiil from a single epithehal cell. This change of the epithelium is secondary to the process of artificial tuberculosis. Oc. III. Obj. 8. Fig. 25. From a vertical section through the injected lung of a child that died of acute mihary tuberculosis. The figure represents about one third of a tubercle. a. Injected blood-vessels; they become impermeable towards the centre of the tubercle. The alveoh, nearer to the centre h are very much distended by a homogeneous or fibrinous material, in the centre of which He small lymphoid cells— probably emigrated colourless blood-corpuscles ; towards the periphery, c, of the nodule, the alveoli are less distended and their Lmng epithelium becomes more distinct. Oc. III. Obj. 6. (Tube half drawn out.) Fig. 26. From a vertical section through the lung of a child that died of acute miliary tuberculosis ; the lung had been very successfaUy injected ■ the vessels, however, do nowhere penetrate into the tubercles The figure represents a tubercle of a later stage than that in fi^' 25 Tlin Inng-tissue that smrounds the tubercle is not unlike adenoid tissue

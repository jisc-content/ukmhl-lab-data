CHAPTER III. THE LYMPHATIC SYSTEM OF THE PULMONARY PLEDBA. The lymphatic vessels of the pulmonary pleura have been studied more recently by Wywodzoff* and Sikorsky.' According to Wywodzoff the superficial lymphatics, i.e. those of the smface of the lung, are placed, in the case of the dog and horse, beneath the proper pleural membrane in the grooves between the lobules, where they form a network. The rootlets of these vessels lie in the septa of the alveoli. The efferent branches of this network communicate with deep lymphatic vessels, but for the most part they run separately towards the root of the lung. According to Sikorsky, the superficial lymph- atics of the lung of cats and dogs take their origin from the sub- pleural alveoli. Their trimks, at first anastomosing with one another, enter the pleura itself and find their way through the ligaments that imite the different lobes, and finally reach the root of the lung. I have studied these lymphatics in the pleura of the lung of dogs, cats, rabbits, guinea-pigs, and young children. They are best de- veloped and easiest to demonstrate in the lung of dogs and young children. In these instances they may be followed imder a lens even in the fresh lung. They appear as clear transparent tubes with a well-defined wall, forming a network, many branches of which corre- spond to the grooves between the superficial lobules of the lung. The larger branches are very conspicuous by their wavy course, and by their valves as recognised by corresponding constrictions. The lymphatics of the pleura of dogs, as well as those of young children, may be easily injected with a two per cent, solution of Briicke's Berlin blue. To effect this the fresh lung is moderately distended by injecting air into the trunk of the bronchus, and is kept so by

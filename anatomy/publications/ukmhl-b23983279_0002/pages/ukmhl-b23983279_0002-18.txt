ANATOMY OF THE LYMPHATIC SYSTEM. 6 CHAPTER 11. THE MATRIX OF THE PULMONARY PLEURA. The matrix of the pulmonary pleura is, in its structure, very similar to that of other serous membranes, i.e. a connective tissue membrane containing elastic fibres and cellular elements; but it is in so far different from other serous membranes, that it is extremely delicate and thin. In horizontal sections of a fresh lung the pleura appears to be composed of very delicate bundles of fine connective-tissue fibres; after the addition of acetic acid fine elastic fibres may be also recognised. These latter vary in abundance in different places and in different animals. In the lung of rabbit, cat, and dog, they are easily to be distinguished as fine networks of elastic fibres, whereas in the lung of guinea-pig they are much more rarely seen. The connective-tissue matrix is, as has been already stated, composed of bundles of delicate fibres. The best object for examining these is the lung of the newborn child and of the guinea-pig. The latter is especially suitable if the animal suffers from slight chronic pleuritis (associated with chronic inflammatory processes of the lung itself), for then the pulmonary pleura becomes partially thickened, and presents a very favourable object of study. In a horizontal section of such a lung, that has been hardened in spirit, after staining it with hsematoxylin, the pulmonary pleura is seen to be a thin membrane composed of bundles of fine connective-tissue fibres. These bundles cross each other, or run for some distance even parallel; in any case there are left spaces between the bundles, or, more correctly speaking, between groups of bundles. The size of each of these spaces depends naturally on tlie extent of the separation of the bundles; and their shape is likewise entirely dependent on the arrangement of the latter.

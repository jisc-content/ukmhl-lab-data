ANATOMY OF THE LYMPHATIC SYSTEM. may be isolated by teasing, of this fact I have satisfied myself repeatedly. (Compare Fig. 27.) It is also insisted npon, if I re- member rightly, by Friedliinder. I cannot therefore accept Hering's view that the ' so-called' giant cell corresponds merely to a granular substance filling up the lumen of a lymphatic vessel, and what is generally, and quite correctly, described as the nuclei of the giant cell to be identical with the endothelial cells (!) of that vessel. On the other hand, I have occasionally seen a giant cell of a distinct tubular shape. But this, I think, may simply mean that the giant cell has, from some reason or other, grown into that shape. Besides, the disposition of the giant cells in many a tubercle of the lung is in conflict with their being identified with lymphatics. In those lungs in which the tubercles show already necrotic changes, numerous blood-vessels are seen to be surrounded by a greater or smaller amount of adenoid tissue perfectly analogous to the perivascular cords, described in artificial tuberculosis of guinea- pigs. Also in the adventitia of the bronchi spherical collections of lymphatic tissue are to be met with.

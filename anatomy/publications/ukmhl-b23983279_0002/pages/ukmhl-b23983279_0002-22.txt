10 ANATOMY OF THE LYMPHATIC SYSTEM. the lymphatic vessels of the surface of the lung, mentioned above. These relations justify our saying that the pleural muscular coat acts like a pump with reference to lymphatic absorption. In the First Part of this work we have had occasion to mention a similar fact with regard to the lymphatic absorption through the diaphragm from the peritoneal cavity. The action of the pleural muscular coat as a pump will hardly be of any marked effect under normal conditions, as there is so very little to be absorbed from the pleural cavity in its healthy state; but under pathological conditions it will have an effect that cannot be under-estimated, for then the pleural muscular coat may materially assist the absorption of the morbid products contained in the pleiual cavity.

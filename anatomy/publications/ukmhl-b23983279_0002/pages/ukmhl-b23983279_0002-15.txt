3 ENDOTHELIUM OF PULMONAEY PLEURA. between each endothelial cell. This is owing to the fact that the endothelial cells are thicker in the centre than at the point where they are in contact with one another. These notches, as seen in profile, evidently correspond to small grooves between the adjacent endothelial cells; they are the less distinct the naore smooth the surface of the endothelium is, or the more the lung has been dis- tended. Owing to the presence of such grooves between contiguous endothelial cells, I have obtained very neat specimens from lungs which, having been injected with Briicke's soluble Berlin blue through the pulmonary artery, had been smeared on their surface with Berlin blue that escaped from the veins or that accumulated on the bottom of the plate on which the lungs had lain during the injection. Horizontal sections, made from the surface of the hardened lung and stained in carmine or hsematoxylin solution, showed, when examined imder the microscope, the endothelium of the plem-a in a very strik- ing manner; viz. the outlines of the individual endothelial cells were stained deep blue, owing to Berlin blue having been precipitated in the grooves between the contiguous endothelial cells as above men- tioned ; the substance of the cells had a faintly stained and distinctly granular appearance, whereas the nucleus came out very promi- nently as a circular body of a deep pink (carmine) or pm-ple colour (hsematoxylin). Different from this is the appearance of the endothelium if the lungs have not been distended. If the lung of a freshly killed guinea-pig be stained in nitrate of silver without having been previously distended, and horizontal sections, comprising the pleura, be examined, the endothelium is found to differ from that of the distended lung in the following respects: (1) The substance of the individual endothelial cells is distinctly granular, whereas in the former case it is pale and transparent, like that of ordinary en- dothelial cells after silver staining, and (2) the endothelial cells are no more flattened plates, but are polyhedral or even columnar. (3) A third, not so very constant difference, is that the nucleus of the endo- thelial cells has more a spherical shape, whereas that of the endo- thelial cells of the pleura pulmonum in the distended lung ia generally circular, when viewed from the surface, and appears B 2

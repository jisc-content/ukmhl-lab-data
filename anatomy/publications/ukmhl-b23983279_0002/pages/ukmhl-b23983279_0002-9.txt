PEEF ACE. The present volume, forming the Second Part of my work on the Lymphatic System, is, like the First Part (that on the Lymphatic System of the Serous Membranes), based on researches undertaken for the Medical Department of the Privy Council. The research was originally intended to have for its object the relation of the lymphatic system of the lung to the process of tuberculosis. It was soon ascertained, however, that our present knowledge of the lymph- atics of the lungs being still incomplete, it was of great importance to subject the normal lung to a careful investigation with regard to the minute distribution of its lymphatics. The result of this in- vestigation has proved of extreme value for understanding the process of artificial tuberculosis in guinea-pigs, as will be pointed out in the Second Section of this volume. In connection with it will be treated the process of acute miliary tuberculosis in man, for the reason that both diseases have been regarded as very similar in anatomical respects. The lung of the guinea-pig had been, as the reader may have already supposed, the chief object of study; the same organ in tlie dog, cat, rat, rabbit, and man has also been investigated.

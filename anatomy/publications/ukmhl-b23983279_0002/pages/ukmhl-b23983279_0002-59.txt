47 CHAPTER Vir. CHANGES OV THE LUNa morEIl IN ARTIFICIAL TUBEKCULOSIS OF GUINEA-PIGS. As is well known, the lung of most guinea-pigs affected with artijficial tuberculosis (on this see Dr. Sanderson ' On the Communicability of Tubercle by Inoculation,' Tenth Eeport of the Medical Officer of the Privy Council for 1867, and Dr. Wilson Fox < On the Artificial Production of Tubercle,' London, Macmillan & Co., 1868) is found to contain a new growth, which by many observers is regarded as very similar to miliary tubercle of man. The macro- and micro- scopical character of this new growth is described by Dr. Sanderson thus :â€” 'The new growth either assumed the form of disseminated nodules, or pervaded the tissue of the lung to such an extent that considerable portions of the organ were consolidated. There was, however, evidently no essential difference between the two forms of lesion, for in those cases in which the induration was continuous in some parts it was constantly observed that there were disseminated nodules in others, and that the material of which the nodules were composed was identical in all its characters with that which formed the larger masses. . . . ' The nodules, when examined with the naked eye or with a lens, present great uniformity of appearance. They are always found in much greater numbers under the pleura than in the parenchyma of the lung. The sub-pleural surface of each nodule is slightly convex, so that it projects more or less above the general surface of the pleura, exliibiting itself as an iron-grey patch, which contrasts strongly with the pink-white hue of the healthy lung-tissue which

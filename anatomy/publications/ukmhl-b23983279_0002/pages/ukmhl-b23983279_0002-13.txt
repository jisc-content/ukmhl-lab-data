ANATOMY OF THE LYMPHATIC SYSTEM. II. THE LUKG. Section I.â€”TEE NORMAL CONDITIONS. CHAPTER I. THE ENDOTHELIUM OF THE PTJLMONAIiy PLEURA. The pulmonary pleura is, like the costal pleura and other serous membranes, covered with a single layer of endothelial cells. There exists, however, a marked difference in morphological characters between the endothelium of the pulmonary pleura and that of other serous membranes. If we take, for instance, the endothelium cover- ing the costal pleura, we find it composed of ordinary flattened nucleated cells, the shape of which is generally that of polygonal placoids. In the normal condition it is always found as such; it is only in pathological processes, especially in chronic inflammations, that we find changes of a certain kind, which will be mentioned in the Second Section, and which may be referred to here by anticipation. In that membrane the endothelial cells surrounding the stomata, first described by Dybkovski,^ become germinative, i.e. they become poly- hedral, even shortly columnar, and distinctly granular; while their nucleus shows a constriction or is actually divided into two. Such endothelial cells present, when viewed from the surface in the fresh condition, more the aspect of epithelium. These changes have been ' See Notes at end of book. B

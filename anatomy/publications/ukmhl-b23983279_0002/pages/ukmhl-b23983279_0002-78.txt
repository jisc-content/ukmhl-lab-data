66 ANATOMY OP TEE LYMPHATIC SYSTEM. In advanced cases of artificial tuberculosis the catarrhal changes spread from the alveoli on the infundibula and smaller bronchi. In the latter the germination of the lining epithelium may reach such a degree that the lumen of the air tubule becomes, for some distance, almost completely blocked up by several layers of nucleated cells of a polyhedral shape. Amongst these the intraepithelial connective- tissue corpuscles—i.e. the pseudostomatous tissue described in the First Section—are seen to penetrate in great abundance. As may be expected from the compression and degeneration of the blood-vessels, the products of the catarrhal process finally imdergo fatty degeneration and necrosis, i.e. caseation. This process starts, as a rule, from the cell-masses that fill up the alveolar cavities, and while spreading gradually involve also the thickened interalveolar trabeculse. I have seen advanced cases where the lung contained several caseous masses of pyramidal shape, and showing on section racimose markings. Their basis reached almost the pleural surface, and their apex was represented by one of the larger bronchi. This latter and all its tributaries were replaced by the necrotic material, and hence the racimose markings. In several cases I have seen extensive parts of the lung becoming consolidated without cheesy transformation. The tissue of these parts was represented by an almost uniform reticulum of nucleated cells with very numerous and finely branched anastomosing processes. I first thought this tissue takes its origin from the alveolar contents of the inflamed parts ; after a more careful examination, however, I became much more inclined to think that it is due to an excessive development of the interalveolar tissue, the epithelial cells of the corresponding alveoli being gradually made to disappear, and the alveoli themselves becoming more or less permeated by that reti- culum.

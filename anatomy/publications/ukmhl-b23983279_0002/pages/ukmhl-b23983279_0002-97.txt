EXPLANATION OF PLATES. 85 the wall of perivascular lymphatics, or, as in the upper pai"t of the figure, being the lymphatic itself. Oc. III. Obj. 1. PLATE IV. Fro. 16. Prom a section through a guinea-pig's lung (artificial tubercu- losis in a slight degree), showing the development of lymphatic fol- licles and cords in the wall of perivascular lymphatics. , a. Artery in longitudinal section, i. Lymphatics. c. Lymphatic tissue (adenoid tissue). d. Muscular coat of artery. Oc. III. Obj. 4. Fig. 17. From a section through a guinea-pig's lung, normal. a. Injected branches of pulmonary vein. h. Alveoli with their lining epithelium. c. Perivascular lymphatics, lined by an endothelial membrane. Oc. in. Obj. 5. Fig. 18. Section through a larger bronchus of the lung of a guinea-pig; the blood-vessels had been injected from the pulmonary artery, the injection material (cold Berlin-blue) had escaped through the lymphatic vessels, whereby these latter had also become injected. They were not fully injected, but their wall was brought out distinctly by the adherent Berlin-blue, the lymphatic vessels being at the same time distended, as is represented in the drawing. The lung was hardened in spirit, and the preparation stained with hematoxylin. In the upper part of the figure the bronchial wall is seen longitudinally from its external surface. a. Epithelium. h. Muscular coat. c. A duct of a mucous gland. d. Veins. e. Branch of pulmonary artery. /. Branch of bronchial artery. g. Perivascular lymphatics. h. Peribronchial lymphatics, both anastomosing with each other. Lymph-follicle. li. Cartilage. Oc. 11. Obj. 4 (Tube not drawn out.)

84 EXPLANATION OF PLATES. the actual preparation, in order to make the drawing not too complicated. d. Interalveolar connective-tissue corpuscles sending processes between the epithelial cells of the alveoli—Pseudo-stomatous tissue. Oc. III. Obj. 7. : Fig. 12. From a section through a guinea-pig's lung that had been in- jected with nitrate of silver, and then frozen, in order to cut the sections. a. Branch of pulmonary artery. h. Lymphatic vessels in connection with c. Interalveolar lymph-spaces, i.e. the lymph-canalicular system. Oc. II. Obj. 5. Fig. 13. A. From the same lung, showing the interalveolar lymph-spaces in the surface-view. B. From the same lung, showing the lining epithelium of the alveoli; between them small holes—pseudo-stomatous canals. See expla- nation of fig. 11. Oc. II. Obj. 5. Fig. 14. From a vertical section through the lung of a guinea-pig suf- feriug from slight artificial tuberculosis. " a. Branch of pulmonary artery. The arrangement of its circular muscular coat is very striking. h. Perivascular lymphatics, probably only lymph-sinuses bor- dered by connective-tissue bundles lined with endothelium. These lymphatic spaces contain granular material (coagu- lated plasm) and lymph-corpuscles, c. d. Muscular bundles transversely cut. a'. A small branch of the artery. Oc. III. Obj. 5. Fig. 1.5. From a vertical section through an injected lung of a guinea- pig suffering from artificial tuberculosis. a. Branch of pulmonary vein. h. Capillaries around the alveoli. c. Alveoli with their epithelium. • d. Lymphatics. e. A lymphatic filled with lymph-corpuscles. /'. Perivascular adenoid tissue, either only in cbunectiou with

ANATOMY OF THE LYMPHATIC SYSTEM. 28 canals of communication between the free surface and the inter- fascicular lymph-spaces, in which lie the connective-tissue cells of the mucosa. We are now enabled to understand how, in the experiments of Sikorsky, pigment or other formed particles may penetrate between the epithelial cells into the lymph-spaces of the bronchial mucous membrane. I may mention, before concluding this chapter, that Mr. Herbert "\\'atney has found analogous relations with regard to the mucous membrane of the alimentary canal, which, I believe, are of great importance for understanding the normal process of absorption in the intestinal canal.

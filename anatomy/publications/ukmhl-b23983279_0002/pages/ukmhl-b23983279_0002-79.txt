67 CHAPTER VIII. ACUTE MILIARY TUBERCULOSIS IN MAN.. To enter into the recent literature of the liistology of miliary tubercle of man is far beyond the scope of this work, especially as tliis subject has been fully treated of in the well-known works of Waldenburg, Langhanns, Rindfleisch, E. Wagner, Klebs, Koster, Schuppel, T. Hering, Friedlander, and others. In the present chapter I will be content with describing the structure and develop- ment of miHary tubercle of the lung, occui-ring in the disease known as acute miliary tuberculosis. Before doing so I will venture to quote certain passages from Buhl's admirable work, which contain a short, and I believe a fair, account of the histology of miliary tubercle in general. Buhl writes thus: 'With regard to its histology especially, E. Wagner has established a closely-meshed network (reticulum, reticular tubercle), containing in its meshes cellular elements, the si^e and number of which increase from the periphery towards the centre. 'Fresh young tubercles contain, however, two distinct kinds of fibres. 1. Peripheral dense tracts of connective tissue, arranged cir- cular and parallel; in them one recognises the small spherical shining nuclei of cells. 2. Continuous with 1, and extending towards the centre, is the ^rojper reticulum, which, from want of nuclei, I do not regard as connective-tissue, but as a homogeneous connective- substance. ... I have never been able to detect true nuclei in it. It is also neceesary to mention that the substance of the reticulum is the softer the younger the tubercle ; in fact, the reticulum is alto- gether wanted in the first rudiment of the tubercle, and hence the cells are found closely situated to one another. r 2

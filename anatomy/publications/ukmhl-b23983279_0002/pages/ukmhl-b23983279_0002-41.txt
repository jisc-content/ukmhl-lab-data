29 CHAPTER V. XHE PERIVASCULAR LYMPHATICS OF THE PROPER LUNG-TISSUE. AccoRDiNa to Wywodzoff there exists in the connective-tissue wall of the alveoli of the lung of dogs and horses a system of small anasto- mosing lymph-canals, the larger of which run in the direction of the elastic fibres and then follow the coiurse of the capillary blood-vessels, at the same time crossing the latter in many places. In the meshes of the capillary blood-vessels they become confluent, so as to form lacunae. These canals and lacunas represent the rootlets of the lymphatic vessels of the lung. Sikorsky found, in his experiments, that there exists in the walls of the alveoli a special network of spaces which consists of canaliculi and lacunae, the latter being situated at the nodes where the canali- culi anastomose. The lacunae are of an irregular shape, triangular, rhombic, or stellate, and are always found to be situated in the meshes between the capillary blood-vessels. The canaliculi cross the blood-vessels in all directions. This system of canaliculi and lacunae form the rootlets from which the lymphatic trunks originate that accompany the larger blood-vessels. These trunks are situated in the adventitia of the arteries and veins, generally a couple of them to each blood-vessel. They enter the root of the lung together with the veins. In the previous chapter mention has been made of the existence of numerous lymphatics around the large branches of the pulmonary artery. In the connective tissue that surrounds the smaller (large microscopical) branches of the pulmonary artery, lymphatics are dis- cernible as regular tubes, and also as irregular spaces or simple lym- phatic cavities. To understand these it is necessary to bear in mind

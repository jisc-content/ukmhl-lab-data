621 DISSECTION OF THE HIP-JOINT. considered separate ligaments; the transverse properly be- longs to the cotyloid, and the ilio-femoral to the capsular. The Capsular or Orbicular Ligament, Fig. 220 (s), like that of the shoulder-joint, completely surrounds the ar- ticulation ; its fibres are not, however, like those of that liga- ment, intermixed with the tendons of surrounding muscles. Above and in front it is thicker and stronger than it is behind and below. Externally it is composed of longitu- dinal fibres which are parallel to each other, and internally of fibres that run in different directions, and interlace with each other; by this arrangement of its fibres the strength of the ligament is very much increased. Its superior attach- ment embraces the circum- ference of the acetabulum, from the margin of which, excepting the portion formed by the transverse ligament, its fibres are prolonged for some distance on the bone; its inferior attachment sur- rounds the neck of the femur, but not so as to include the whole of it within the joint; the principal part excluded is situated between the trochan- ters and above the posterior intertrochanteric ridge. This should be noticed with refer- ence to fractures, as it allows of a fracture of the neck oc- curring partly within and partly without the capsular ligament; in which case, by proper treatment, osseous Tinion may be obtained. The length of the inner and lower part of the ligament is greater than the distance between the corresponding points of attachment; hence Fig. 220. The Ligaments op the Pelvts and Hip-joint.â€”1.

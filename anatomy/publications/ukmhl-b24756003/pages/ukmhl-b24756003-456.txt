448 OF THE PELVIS. Fig. 191. separate nerve. It perforates the psoas muscle, and descends on Its mner side to the pubes, which it passes over on the inner side of the iho-pectmeal eminence to get beneath the pecti- neus muscle, where it gives off its articular filaments to the 1?'^?^ J* divides into several other branches; one of which descends as low as the upper and back part of the leg sending m its course a filament to the knee-joint. The superior gluteal nerve, Fig. 192 (2), may be examined next. It arises from the lumbo-sacral before it joins the first sacral nerve to become a part of the sacral plexus. It escapes from the pelvis in company with the glu- teal artery through the up- per part of the great sacro- sciaticforamen, above and in front of the pyriformis muscle, and divides into two branches which cor- respond in their distri- bution with the gluteal artery. It supplies the gluteus medius, minimus, and tensor vaginae femoris muscles. The lumbosacral nerve, Fig. 192 (1), is formed by ' the union of the descend- ing portion of the fourth lumbar, and the fifth lum- bar. It enters the pelvis, and assists in forming the sacral plexus. There are six anterior sacral nerves, including what is sometimes called The Lumbak Plexus and its Branches (slightly altered from Schmidt).â€” a. Last rib. b. Quadratus lumborum muscle, c. Oblique and transverse muscles, cut near the crest of the ilium, d. Os pubis, e. Adductor brevis muscle. /. Pec- tineus. g. Adductor longus. 1. Superior musculo-cutaneous branch. 2. Middle musculo-cutaneous branch. .3. Inferior miisculo-cutaneo\is branch. 4. Anterior crural nerve. 5. Accessory obturator. 6. Obturator nerve. 7. Genito-orural nerve dividing into two at its origin from the plexus. 8, 8. Gangliated cord of tho sympathetic nerve.

251 DISSECTION OF THE AEM. Fig. 108. tance above the elbow-joint. The short head is muscular from near its origin; while the long one continues tendinous to near their junction. The latter is bound down in the bicipital groove by transverse fibres, which are said to be torn some- times, allowing a displacement of this tendon. The biceps is inserted into the tubercle of the radius. From its tendon proceeds an aponeurotic expansion, Fig. 107 (31), which passes in- wards and downwards across the elbow-joint, and joins the aponeurosis of the forearm, which, by means of this con- nection, is made tense by the contraction of the biceps mus- cle. This fibrous expansion IS liable to be wounded in bleeding at the bend of the arm, which may be followed by lameness in the limb for a few days. This muscle flexes the fore- arm on the arm, and renders its aponeurosis tense. It can also rotate the radius out- wards, and assist in abduct- ing the arm, as it is attached above the shoulder-joint. The ?.ctiou of the biceps on the xipper part of the radius, when a fracture occurs just below the tubercle, is to ro- tate the upper fragment out- wards, and draw it upwards, °« '^^^^^s OP THE Arm.-a.

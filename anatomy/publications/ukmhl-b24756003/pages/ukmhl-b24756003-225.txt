DISSECTION OF THE AXILLAKY EEGION. 217 lesser internal cutaneous, wMcli lies close to it on the inner side The tdnar is just behind the internal cutaneous, and to the inside of the artery; this is about the size of one ot the roots of the median nerve. Behind the ulnar nerve and partly behind the artery, is the musculo-spiral nerve. 1 his is quite as laro-e as the median nerve. The circumflex nerve m directly behind the artery.

They are described here because the dissection of the artery necessarily involves them, while the dissection of the nerves exposes the artery. The axillary artery is usually represented as giving off 19

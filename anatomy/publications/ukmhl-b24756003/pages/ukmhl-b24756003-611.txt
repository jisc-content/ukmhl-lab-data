603 LIGAMENTS OF THE KNEE-JOINT. surface of the tibia is not covered with this fibro-cartilag-e. Although these are interarticular fibro-cariilages, they differ from those of other joints, as they do not form a septum The Right Knee-Joint laid open from the front, in order to show the In- ternal Ligaments.—1. The cartilaginous surface of the lower extremity of the femur with its two condyles; the figure 5 rests upon the external; the figure 3 upon the internal condyle. 2. The anterior crucial ligament. 3. The posterior crucial liga- ment. 4. The transverse ligament. 5. The attachment of the ligamentum mucosum; the rest has been removed. 6. The internal semilunar fibro-cartilage. 7. The external semilunar fibro-cartilage. 8. A part of the ligamentum patcllas turned down. 9. The bursa, situated between the ligamentum patellce and the head of the tibia; it has been laid open. 10. The anterior superior tibio-fibular ligament. 11. The upper part of the interosseous membrane; the opening in this membrane is for the passage of the anterior tibial vessels. ■which divides the cavity into two compartments, but are covered on both sides with the same synovial membrane. The Internal Semilunar FiBRO-OARTiLAGE,Fig.259 (b), is placed on the internal glenoid cavity of the tibia, and is applied by its superior surface to the internal condyle of the femur. Its borders terminate in an anterior and a posterior cornu, which are attached to the head of the tibia, one before and the other behind the spine; the anterior cornu is con- nected to the anterior crucial ligament. The internal lateral and posterior ligaments are in apposition with its convex border. The synovial membrane is continuous from one surface to the other over its thin concave margin.

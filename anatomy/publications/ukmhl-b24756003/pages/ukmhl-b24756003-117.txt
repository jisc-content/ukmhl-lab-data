109 THE EYEBALL. yitreous humor, is traversed in the centre by a canal, called the canal of Gloqiiet, Fig. 25 (14), for the transmission of a branch of the central artery of the retina. This artery assists in nourishing the hyaloid membrane, and, probably, the lens. Near the margin of the lens the hyaloid membrane divides into two layers, one of which passes in front, and the other behind it. Between these two layers and the margin of the lens is a series of cells, constituting what has been called the canal of Petit, Fig. 25 (9). These cells may be demonstrated by inflating them with a fine blowpipe. Just behind the canal of Petit, the hyaloid membrane is somewhat thickened, and presents folds or plicse, named the hyaloid processes. These processes are received into grooves between the ciliary processes. When the latter are removed, the former with the pigment adhering to them form the zonula of Zinn. The vitreous body is in relation with the retina, the ciliary processes, and the lens, which is partly embedded in it. The vitreous humor is composed of water and about two per cent, of saline substances in solution. Fig. 29. Fig. 30. A Side View of tub Adult Lens.â€”1. Its anterior face. 2. Its posterior faco. 3,3.

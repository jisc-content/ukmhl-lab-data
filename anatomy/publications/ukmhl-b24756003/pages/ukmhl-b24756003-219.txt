The pectoralis major may now be raised from its origin, taking care to observe the nerves and arteries which pene- trate its under surface. The nerves come from the axillary, and consist of one or two branches, called the superior thoracic, Fig. 93. The arteries are branches of the superior thoracic and thoracica acrornialis, Fig. 92, which arise, most frequently, by a common trunk, from the axillary artery. The pectoralis major should be

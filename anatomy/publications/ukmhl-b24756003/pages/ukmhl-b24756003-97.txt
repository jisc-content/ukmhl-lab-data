89 SINUSES OF THE DUEA MATEE. right one is'usually larger than the left. They are situated, in the horizontal part of their course, along the convex or attach- ed border of the tentorium. Thej are the largest of all the sinuses in the dura mater, as they receive the blood from all the rest, to empty it into the internal jugular veins. They increase in size as they proceed towards the jugular foramina, to receive the contents of the petrosal sinuses, the mastoid, and also the inferior cerebral and cerebellar veins. The inferior or curved portion of each is deeply imbedded in the bone, and when cut across presents an oval figure, while the horizontal portion projects between two layers of the ten- torium, and is of a triangular shape. The CAVERNOUS SINUSES are situated one on each side of the sella turcica. They are of an irregular shape, and have a reti- culated structure internally. Each receives the ophthalmic vein of the corresponding side. The third and fourth nerves, Fig. 19. and the ophthalmic branch of the fifth, pass through its .outer wall; the internal ca- rotid artery, and the sixth nerve, pass between its fibrous covering and the serous mem- brane which lines it. The two cavernous sinuses are connected by the circular sinus. The petrosal sinuses establish a communication be- tween them and the lateral sinuses. The CIRCULAR SINUS sur- rounds the pituitary gland, from which it receives several small veins. The TRANSVERSE SINUS lics across the cuneiform process of the occipital bone. Some- times there are two of them.

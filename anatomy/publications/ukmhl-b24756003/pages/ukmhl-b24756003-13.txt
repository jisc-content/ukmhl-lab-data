PEERAGE. In preparing a Treatise on. Practical Anatomy for tbe use of medical students, I have not been influenced by the hope that I should be able to add anything new to the fuud of knowledge which is to be found in the various works which have been written on anatomy; nor have I expected to be able to introduce much that would be new to any one who has had much experience in teaching practical anatomy. As our medical institutions are now organized, the student must expect to obtain his knowledge of anatomy from two distinct sourcesâ€”namely, the anatomical theatre, and the dis- secting-room. In the anatomical theatre^ he is taught ana- tomy after whatever plan is adopted by the Professor of that department in the institution with which he happens to be connected. Here, every part requiring dissection passes through the hands of the Prosector before it is presented to him for his inspection, all the parts not at the time under consideration having been removed. In this way, the stu- dent is taught anatomy systematically; he has each system, as the muscular, the vascular, &c., presented to him by itself. He is also provided with what is called a text-looh, in which he finds everything presented in the same order as in the lecture- room. Thus, in learning-anatomy in this way, he is required to do but little more than to listen to what is told him, to ob- serve the illustrations employed by the lecturer, and to read his text-book. 1*

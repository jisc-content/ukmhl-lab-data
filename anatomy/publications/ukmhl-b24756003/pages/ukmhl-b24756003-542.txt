THE LOWER EXTREMITY. 534 also cover the articular cartilages found on the oblique pro- cesses. *^ The articulation of the odontoid process with the anterior arch of the atlas consists of a small concave facet on the former, and a corresponding convex one on the latter. Both of these are covered with cartilage and synovial membrane; they are also surrounded by a few ligamentous fibres, which form a sort of capsular ligament. Fig. 231.

Space for the spinal cord. 4, 4. Articular processes; on the left one a remnant of the capsular membrane is seen. Posteriorly, the odontoid process articulates with the Trans- verse Ligament, Fig. 231 (2). This ligament consists of a strong fasciculus of fibres which are attached to the inner sides of the lateral masses of the atlas. Its connection with the odontoid process is similar to that between the latter and the anterior arch of the atlas, a smooth concave articular facet being found on the anterior surface of the ligament, and a corresponding one on the posterior surface of the process. The synovial membrane, which lines this cavity, extends upwards on the process to near its summit. The ring, that is formed by the parietes of these articulations, has a smaller orifice below than above, being adapted to the shape of the odontoid process, so that the process will be retained in siiCo after all the other connections between the atlas and axis, or between these and the occipital bone have been cut away. From the upper edge of the transverse ligament a layer of fibres passes upwards, to be inserted into the anterior margin of the occipital foramen; and another layer of fibres from the inferior margin descends to be attached to the axis. The term cruciform has been applied to the transverse ligament, including the vertical fibres attached to its two borders.

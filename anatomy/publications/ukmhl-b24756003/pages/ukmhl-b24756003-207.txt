They diverge somewhat as they proceed backwards, giving to the rima glottidis the shape of the letter V, with the angle pointing forwards. The inferior are covered by mucous mem- brane on their inner and upper surfaces, while the superior are covered on their inner, lower, and external surfaces. The muscles of the larynx are small, and generally named from the parts to which they are attached. The thyro-hyoideus was described with the muscles of the neck. The Crico-Thyeoideus, Fig. 82 (3), is quite short, and of a triangular shape. It arises from the anterior part of the cricoid cartilage, by a narrow point, and passes upwards and outwards to be inserted into the thyroid cartilage, occupying

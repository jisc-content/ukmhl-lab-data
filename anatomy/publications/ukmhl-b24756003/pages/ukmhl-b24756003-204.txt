DISSECTION OF THE NECK. 196 the base is concave, and adapted to the corresponding articu- lar surface on the cricoid cartilage. The arytenoid cartilages belong essentially to the vocal chords, and as such should be Fig. 75. Fig. 76. Ak Anterior View of the Left Arytenoid Cartilage.—1. Its ante- rior face.

By means of these movements the vocal chords can be made tense or relaxed, and the size of the fissure between them, called the rima glottidis, can be increased or diminished in width. The Appendices are two small bodies surmounting the apices of the arytenoid cartilages. They are inclined backwards and towards each other, lengthening the curvature of these cartilages in this direc- tion, and at the same time increasing their vertical diameter. The Epiglottis, Fig. 77, is generally spoken of as a fibro-cartilage, although its structure seems to be peculiar to itself. It is of an oval form. Its posterior surface is concave transversely, and convex vertically; its anterior surface is just the reverse. The upper part of its anterior surface is free, and covered by mucous membrane, while the lower part is attached to the tongue, os hyoides, and thyroid cartilage. It is con- A Lateral View of the Epiglottis.— 1. Anterior or convex surface. 2. Posterior or concave surface. 3. Superior margin. 4. Inferior margin or pedicle. 5, 5. Its sides.

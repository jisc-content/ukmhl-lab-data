The sacro-iliac articulation is formed by the sacrum and ilium. The articular surfaces, from their shape, have been called the auricular facets. The connecting media consist of anterior and posterior fibres, and an intermediate layer of cartilage^ which adheres very closely to the bones. The Antekioe. Saceo-Iliac Ligament, Fig. 233 (7), is composed of a thin layer of fibres, extending transversely from one bone to the other; they are scarcely raised above the contiguous smooth surfaces. The PosTEEiOR Saceo-Tltac Ligament, Fig. 232 (s), con- sists of several fasciculi, which extend from a rough surface behind the auricular facet of one bone to a corresponding sur- face on the other. Some of the fibres are oblique, and others Fig. 232. 3

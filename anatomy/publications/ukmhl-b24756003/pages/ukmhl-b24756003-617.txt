LIGAMENTS OF THE ANKLE-JOINT. 609 arises narrow from the inner and lower part of tbe internal malleolus, and, spreading out, passes downwards, some of its fibres being directed forwards, to be inserted into the os calcis Fig. 263. Fig- 264. An Internal View of the Ankle- JoiNT—Right Leg.—1. The internal malleolus of the tibia. 2, 2. Part of the astragalus; the rest is concealed by the ligaments. 3. The os calcis. 4. The scaphoid bone. 5. The internal cunei- form bone. 6. The internal lateral or deltoid ligament. 7. The anterior liga- ment. 8. The tendo-Achillis; a small bursa is seen interposed between the ten- don and the tuberosity of the os calcis. An External View of the Ankle- JoiNT—Right Leg.—1. The tibia. 2.

The latter arises immediately below the for- mer, and is inserted into the astragalus. The tendons of the long flexors of the toes and the tibialis posticus pass over and partly conceal the lower and posterior part of this liga- ment. The Anterior Ligament, Fig. 263 (7), is broad but very thin; it arises from the lower and anterior part of the tibia, and passes downwards and forwards to be inserted into the astragalus. It is covered by the tendons of the muscles which pass down in front of the ankle-joint. Some care is requisite to preserve the fibres which compose this ligament. A posterior ligament of the ankle-joint can hardly be said to exist; its place is mainly, if not wholly, supplied by the transverse tibio-fibular ligament and the posterior fasciculus of the external lateral ligament. A good deal of adipose sub- stance is found outside of the synovial membrane, both in

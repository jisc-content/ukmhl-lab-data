598 THE LOWER EXTREMITY. The LiGAMENTUM Patell^., Fig. 257 (3), may be regarded as a_ continuation of the tendon of the quldri Jeps exfo^or cruris; so that instead of arising from the patella, the latter might be considered a sesamoid bone developed in the tendon quadriceps muscle, of which the ligamentum patellar T.t . f-^^ ^^^^ P'"'"^- attached below to the tubercle ot the tibia, where it is considerably narrower than it is at its attachment to the patella. It is about two inches in length By observing its white, shining appearance, the dissector will have no difficulty m distinguishing it from the surroundino- parts. Whether it be considered a ligament or not, it serves as the medium through which the above-mentioned muscle acts on the leg. When the cavity of the joint has been opened Pig. 257.

The syno- vial membrane. 5. The inter- nal lateral ligament. 6. The long external lateral ligament. 7. The anterior superior tibio- fibular ligament. A Posterior View of the Ligaments op the Enee-JOINT.—1. The fasciculus of the ligamentum postieum Winslowii, which is derived from 2, the tendon of thesemi-membranosus muscle; the latter is cut short. 3. The process of the tendon which spreads out in the fascia of the popliteus muscle. 4. The process which is sent inwards beneath the internal lateral ligament. 5. The posterior part of the internal lateral ligament. 6. The long ex- ternal lateral ligament. 7. The short external lateral ligament. 8. The tendon of the popliteus muscle, surrounded by synovial membrane. 9. The posterior superior tibio-fibular ligament. and examined, the ligamentum patellte should be divided a short distance beloAV the patella, Fig. 259 (e), and its relations to the cavity and to the tibia carefully studied; a small bursa,

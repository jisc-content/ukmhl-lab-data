OP THE ABDOMEN. 400 of the umhilical vein of the foetus, and posteriorly, the remains of the ductus vetwsus. The transverse fissure is occupied by the capsule of Ol'isson, the portal vein, the hepatic artery and duct, the hepatic plexus of nerves, and the deep absorhent vessels. The pons hepatis, Fig. 169 (i i), when present, consists of a portion of the substance of the liver, extending across the left antero-posterior fissure beneath the ligamentum teres. The mouths of the hepatic veins will be observed opening into the vena cava behind the lobus Spigelii, on the pos- terior border of the liver. There are usually three or four of these veins. The capsule of Glisson is a dense areolar tissue which sur- rounds the vessels in the transverse fissure, and is prolonged into the substance of the liver, forming sheaths, named portal canals, Fig. 170, a, a, for these vessels; it also forms the proper capsule of the entire organ, as weU. as an investment Fig. 170.

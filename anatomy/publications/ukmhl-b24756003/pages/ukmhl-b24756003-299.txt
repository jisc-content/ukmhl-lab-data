291 DISSECTION OF THE THOEAX. CHAPTER II. Sect. I.â€”Dissection of the Thoeax. The thorax is situated between the neck above, the abdo- men below, and the upper extremities laterally. The solid panetes of the thoracic cavity consist of the sternum and costal cartilages in front, of the ribs laterally, and the dorsal vertebrae, with the posterior extremities of the ribs behind. The s^ape of the thorax is that of a truncated cone, indented behind by the spinal fossae. Its base is oblique, sloping from the xiphoid cartilage downwards and backwards to the first lumbar vertebra. Its apex is also oblique, but from before upwards and backwards to the last cervical vertebra; hence the vertical diameter of the thoracic cavity is much greater behind than before. The spaces between the ribs are occupied by aponeurosis and the intercostal muscles, which are perforated by branches of the intercostal arteries and nerves, and by branches of the internal mammary arteries. The upper orifice of the thoracic cavity is broader trans- versely than from behind forwards. Its boundaries are formed, in front, by the upper border of the sternum, on each side by the first rib, and behind, by the first dorsal vertebra. It transmits the oesophagus, the trachea, the thoracic duct, the pneumogastric, phrenic, and sympathetic nerves, and the large arteries and veins of the head, neck, and upper extremities ; the superior intercostal and internal mammary arteries, with the recurrent laryngeal nerves, also pass through it. Besides the parts just enumerated, and the thoracic fascia, which surrounds and connects them together, the apex of each lung, with the pleura and several muscles, are included in this opening. The lower orifice is four or five times larger than the upper, and is liable to much greater variation in size. It is bounded in front by the xiphoid cartilage, laterally by the lower six

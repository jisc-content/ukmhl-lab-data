104 DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. The canal of Fontana is a groove situated between the cor- nea, sclerotica, and the ciliary ligament. Passing over the choroid coat will be seen the ciliary nerves, Fig. 26; and the two long ciliary arteries, which anastomose around the ciliary ligament with each other and with the anterior ciliary arteries, forming a circle, from which branches are sent into the iris, where another circle is formed. The nerves also penetrate the ligament to reach the iris. _ The veins, Fig. 26, c, in the eye do not accompany the arte- ries ; they are arranged so as to form in the outer layer of the choroid the vasa vorticosa; these form four or five princi- Fig. 26.

Its external surface presents a smooth, shining ap- pearance, being covered by the inner layer of the tunica serosa. Its color is a jet black. Having examined the structures now exposed as far as can be done in the present stage of the dissection, the iris may be divided with the scissors into three sections, and re- flected backwards without breaking up its connection with the ciliary ligament.

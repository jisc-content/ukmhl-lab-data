ANTERIOR PART OF LEG, DORSUM OF THE FOOT. 569 Fig. 242. removing it not to take up the superficial fascia with it, if the subcutaneous vessels and nerves are to be examined. Having raised the integument on the leg as far as the in- ner angle of the tibia internally, and to a short distance behind the fibula externally, and on the foot as far as its inner and outer borders back to within about an inch of the heel, the vessels and nerves in the superficial fascia should be dissected. There is neither any subcutaneous artery or vein of sufficient size on the anterior or outer part of the leg, to require any special notice. The only nerve of much im- portance is the musculo-cutaneous, Eig. 242 (3), a branch of the external popli- teal or peroneal nerve. This nerve must be looked for perforating the deep fascia near the junction of the middle with the lower third of the leg, and a little to the inner side of a line corresponding to the fibula. It is quite a large nerve, and with a little care the student cannot fail to find it; and when found, it is easily traced down the leg, and on the dorsum of the foot. It gives off a small branch called the exter- nal malleolar branch, which passes over the external malleolus, and anastomoses with a branch of the external saphe- nous nerve. It then divides into four terminal branches, which are distributed to the toes. The first one, commencing internally, goes to the inner side of the great toe ; the second goes to the outer side of the great toe, and to the inner side of the second toe; the third sup- plies the outer part of the second, and the inner part of the third toe • the > ^^'^^ °^ ™^ Cutaneous /ot^r^^ is distributed to the outer side of l^7n:YZ:Z::TC:. the third, and to the inner side of the ^™ °^ "^^^ Foot.—1. in- fourth toe.

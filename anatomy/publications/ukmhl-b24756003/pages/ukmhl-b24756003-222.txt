214 THE UPPER EXTREMITY. ralis major, the fibres of which it crosses nearly at a right angle. By observing its attachments, and the direction of its fibres, it will be seen that it can draw the scapula down- wards, forwards, and inwards; or when the shoulder is carried upwards and backwards, and fixed in this position, it can elevate the ribs from which it takes its origin. Thus by placing the arm and shoulder in a proper position, both the pectoral muscles become powerful agents in expanding the upper part of the thorax. In raising this muscle, the dissector should look for the inferior thoracic artery and nerve^ Figs. 92, 93, which penetrate its under surface. The nerve is quite small, and comes from the plexus behind the muscles, and passes between the axil- lary artery and vein. This artery varies very much in its origin, as do all the branches of the axillary artery. Fig. 91. A View of the Deeper- seated Muscles on the Upper Front of the Trunk.â€”1.

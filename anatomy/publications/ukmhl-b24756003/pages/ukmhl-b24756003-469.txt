The last-named fascia will be more particularly noticed at another stage of the dissection. That part of the perineum just dissected belongs essentially to the lower portion of the intestinal canal; while the part that remains to be dissected belongs more particularly to the genito-urinary apparatus. It must be admitted that the latter is more complex and difiicult to be examined than the former; and it should be remarked here that, although different fascias are spoken of, and have distinct names, they are all con- tinuous with each other, and might be regarded as consti- tuting a single fascia or aponeurosis. By the different reflections and attachments of the fascite, there are formed four principal cavities or 'pockets. Two of Fig. 195.

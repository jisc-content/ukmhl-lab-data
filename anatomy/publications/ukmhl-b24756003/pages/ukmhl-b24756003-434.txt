It presents two enlargements: the bulbous, and the fossa navicularis. The former. Fig. 181 (12), is situated in the lower part and near its commencement, and the latter, Fig. 181 (13), which is a lateral dilatation, near the meatus. Just in front of the bulbous portion are seen, on the lower surface, the orifices of the ducts of Cowper's glands, Fig. 181 (11). Crypts, or lacunoi, are found distributed over the whole surface. Some of these are the external orifices of canals which run backwards from half an inch to an inch beneath the mucous membrane. A very large one is sometimes met with on the upper surface, and about three-

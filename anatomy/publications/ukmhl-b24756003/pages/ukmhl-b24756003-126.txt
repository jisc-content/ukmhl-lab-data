DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. The posterior inferior enters the bone lower down and telth ^ ^""^^ filaments which go to the molar and bicuspid _ The anterior dental nerve, Fig. 37 (i e), which enters from the mtra-orbital canal, passes at first horizontally and then down- wards m the anterior wall of the antrum; it sends filaments to the cuspid and incisor teeth, and also to the bone, and the lower meatus of the nose.

THE HEART. 301 The heart should now be lifted from the pericardium so as to brino- into view its remaining surfaces. The interior surface of the right ventricle, Fig. 131 (3) is flat, triangular and horizontal; it corresponds to the cordiforni tendon of the diaphrao-m. The posterior and left surface of the leit ven- tricle, Fig. 131 (4), is round, and corresponds partly to the diaphragm, and partly to the posterior mediastinum and lett lung. The ventricles are separated behind by a groove. Fig. 131 (1 0), similar to the one noticed in front; it is occu- pied by the posterior coronary vessels. Fig. 130. £.10 Fig. 131.

The posterior surface of the auricles, Fig. 131 (1,2), is convex, and corresponds to the posterior mediastinum; it is divided vertically by a groove, which corresponds to the au- ricular septum, and is separated from the ventricles by another groove, which corresponds to the auriculo-ventri- cular septum.

523 DISSECTION OF THE HIP-JOINT. the transmission of vessels to the interior of the joint. What is called the transverse ligament is essentially a part of the cotyloid licrament; the addition of a few fibres which interlace witli each other, and the fact of its subtending the notch does not entitle it to be considered a distinct ligament. The cotyloid ligament increases tlie depth of the acetabulum, and diminishes the diameter of its orifice by the edge being in- clined inwards towards the centre; this constriction is seen Fig. 221. Ligaments of the Pelvis and Hip-Joint.—The view is taken fhom the SIDE.—1. The oblique sacro-iliac ligament. The other fasciculi of the posterior sacro-iliac ligaments are not seen in this view of the pelvis. 2. The great sacro- sciatic ligament. 3. The small sacro-sciatic ligament. 4. The great sacro-sciatic foramen. 5. The small sacro-soiatic foramen. 6. The cotyloid ligament of the acetabulum. 7. The ligamentum teres. 8. The cut edge of the capsular ligament, showing its extent posteriorly, as compared with its anterior attachment. 9, The obturator membrane only partly seen. by the retention of the head of the femur in the cavity after the capsular ligament has been completely severed. The Interarticular Ligament, or Ligamentum Teres, rig. 221 (7), extends from the depression situated just be- low the centre of the head of the femur to the cotyloid notch, to the edges of which it is attached by two distinct fasciculi. It is not round, but of a triangular form, its narrow end being attached to the femur. It is from an inch to an inch

THE LOWER EXTREMITY. 616 also have a transverse direction. At their phalangeal extre- mities they are connected by a transverse liqament. Fig 266(12). ^* The Metatarsal Bones are connected to each of the phalangeal bones by two lateral, and one glenoid ligament for each articulation. Eig. 266 (10, 11). The tendons of the ex- tensor muscles of the toes supply the place of the dorsal liga- ments. The glenoid ligaments are dense, like fibro-cartilage. There is one placed below each articulation, the edges of which are continuous with the lateral ligaments, and also with the sheath of the corresponding tendons of the common flexor muscles of the toes. Each also assists in forming the cavity for the reception of the head of the corresponding metatarsal bone. The lateral ligaments are very strong; each one, as well as the glenoid ligament, is connected with the digital processes of the plantar aponeurosis. The Phalangeal Bones are connected together by means of one glenoid and two lateral ligaments, Eig. 266 (13), for each joint. The glenoid ligament has the same arrangement as in the preceding articulation, and the lateral ligaments also have the same attachments and the same relations as in that joint. As in the metatarso-phalangeal articulations, there are no dorsal ligaments, the tendons of the extensor muscles supplying their places. There is nothing connected with the synovial membranes in these articulations that re- quires any notice.

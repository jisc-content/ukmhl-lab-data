195 OF THE LAKYNX. an oblique ridge. The lower tubercle is situated anteriorly and near the inferior border, while the upper one is placed posteriorly and near the su- perior border. The surface Fig- 74. above and anterior to the oblique ridge is much larger than the one below and be- hind it. The latter is occu- pied by the sterno-thyroid, and the former by the thyro- hyoid muscle. The inferior border of each ala terminates behind in a projection down- wards, called the inferior or small cornu. It articulates with the cricoid cartilage. Just before the small cornu on each side is quite a deep notch; there is also another one, but not so deep in front. The upper border of each ala terminates posteriorly in a much longer projection, call- ed the superior or great cor- nu; this is inclined backwards, and gives attachment to the lateral thyro-hyoid ligament. Anteriorly there is quite a deep notch, which can be distinctly felt in the living body. The posterior borders of the alas are thick and round for" the attachment of the fibres of the inferior constrictor of the pharynx. The Arytenoid Caetilages, Figs. 75, 76, are situated behind, upon the cricoid, and between the alae of the thyroid. They are of a pyramidal form. The posterior surface of each is concave, and occupied by the arytenoid muscle. The ante- rior surface is convex, with a slight elevation near the apex for the attachment of the superior vocal chord. The internal surface is flat and smooth. The base projects anteriorly nearly one-third of the way across the interior of the larynx, and gives insertion to the inferior vocal chord. It also pro- jects posteriorly and externally for the attachment of the crico-ary tenoideus posticus muscle. The articular surface on A Lateral View of the Thyroid Cartilage.â€”1. Its left half. 2.

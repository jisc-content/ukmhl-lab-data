Just before the external popliteal nerve divides into the musculo-cutaneous and the anterior tibial It gives off a small branch to the tibialis anticus muscle, and another to the tibio-libular articulation. Below the anterior annular ligament the anterior tibial nerve divides into two branches; one of which accompanies the dorsal ar- terj to the first interosseous space, where it divides into two branches which are distributed, one to the two sides of the great toe, and the other to the inner side of the second toe. These last branches either anastomose with or take the place of the corresponding branches of the musculo-cutaneous nerve. The other terminal division of the anterior tibial passes obliquely outwards beneath the short common extensor of the toes, and divides into several branches, some of which go to that muscle, while others are distributed to the interosseous spaces. The Musculo- Cutaneous Nerve, Fig. 248 (]), will be seen in the dissection of the muscles on the anterior part of the leg, only while passing between the peroneus longus and the flexor longus digitorum muscles; below this it perforates the deep fiascia and becomes subcutaneous, which part of it has already been described in the superficial fascia. In the first part of its course it passes through the substance of the peroneus longus, and must be exa- mined when that muscle is dissected. On the outer part of the leg will be found the peronei A VIEW OF THE MUS- CULO-CnTANEOUS AND THE Anteriok Tibial Nerve.â€”1. The mus- culo-cutaneous nerve. 2, 3.

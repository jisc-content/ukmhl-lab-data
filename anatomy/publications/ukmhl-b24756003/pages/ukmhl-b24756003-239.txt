231 DISSECTION OF THE BACK. Fig. 98. five or sis dorsal vertebras, and passes upwards and out- wards, and is inserted into the transverse processes of the lower three or four cervical vertebrae. It assists in turning the neck to one side, or in drawing it backwards. The Ceevicalis Ascenuens, or Descenders, Fig. 98 (o), is placed on the outside of the transversalis colli. It arises, by tendinous bands, from the upper four or five ribs, between their angles and tubercles, and passes upwards and outwards, and is inserted into the transverse pro- cesses of the fourth, fifth, and sixth cervical vertebras. The action of this muscle is similar to the last, e?icept that when the neck is fixed, it can assist in elevating the ribs. It is not always possible to make a clear dissection of the last three muscles, nor is it very important that the student should spend much time in attempting to do it. They seem to be a sort of a continuation upwards of the sacro-lumbalis and longissimus dorsi. At this stage of the dissection, the stadent will be able to take a gene- ral survey of the posterior spinal nerves in the deeper part of their course, and, also, of the arteries which go to the back. If he has not destroyed the nerves thus far in the dissection, he can now trace first, the Cervical. The fourth and fifth, and part of the sixth layers of the Muscles op the iiACK.â€”1.

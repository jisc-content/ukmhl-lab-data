PART II. DISSECTION OF THORAX, BACK, AND UPPER EXTREMITY. CHAPTEE I. THE UPPER EXTEEMITY. Sect. I.â€”DissECTioisr of the Pectoral and Axillary Regions. Before commencing the dissection of tliese parts, the stu- dent should make himself familiar with the prominent points around the shoulder and axilla. He should also notice the outlines of the thorax, the regions into which it is divided for the purposes of auscultation and percussion, the position of the mammae, and the degree in which these various regions are subcutaneous or covered by muscles. It will be perceived that the sternum is partly subcuta- neous, also the clavicle, with the acromion process, and spine of the scapula. The position of the coracoid process of the scapala should be ascertained, and its relations to the clavicle and acromion process carefully observed. The position of the upper extremity should be varied so as to show the move- ments of the clavicle and scapula, and any changes which may occur in the general configuration of the parts. An incision may now be made through the skin and super- ficial fascia, commencing at the middle of the upper border of the sternum, and extending along the clavicle to the acro- mion process. Another may then be made along the median line of the sternum^to the xiphoid cartilage; and a third from the sterno-clavicular articulation, to the insertion of the pec- toralis major. The skin may now be raised by reflecting one flap towards the shoulder, and the other towards the lower border of the pectoralis major. In case the abdomen is being

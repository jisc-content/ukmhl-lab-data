43 APPENDAGES OF EYE OUTSIDE OF ORBIT. respond to the breadth of the cartilages. There are between thirty and forty in the tipper lid, and about twenty in the lower. Each tube has opening into it on each side seyerai small pouches or follicles. Their external orifices may be seen on the posterior edge of the free border of each lid, and from which a waxy secretion may be pressed ; tiiis se- cretion prevents the tears from flowing oyer the lids.

They consist of two fibro-cartilaginous plates, one for each lid. Bach one pre- sents two surfaces and two borders. The external surface of each is convex, and separated from the ciliary fibres of the orbicularis palpebrarum by a thin layer of areolar tissue; the internal surface is concave, and grooved for the Mei- bomian glands, and separated from the conjunctiva by areolar tissue also. The free borders are thick, and form the free edges of the eyelids; they are nearly horizontal when the lids are closed, and slightly beveled from before backwards, so as to form, when they are in apposition, a canal for the passage of the tears from the outer to the inner part of the eyeball. The lower one is merely a narrow band, about a line and a half in breadth. The ujpper one is nearly half an inch broad at its centre, but diminishes in breadth towards

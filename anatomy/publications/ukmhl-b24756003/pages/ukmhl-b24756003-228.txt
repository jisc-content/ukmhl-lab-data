220 THE UPPER EXTREMITY. some distance above tlie elbow, and is distributed to the skin on the inner side of the arm. The Intercosto-Humeral is a branch of the second inter- costal nerve; it enters the axilla by perforating the intercostal muscles in the second intercostal space, about midway between the sternum and the vertebral column. It traverses the lower and posterior part of the axilla, and is distributed to the in- tegument of the upper, inner, and posterior part of the arm. It is connected, as before mentioned, to the lesser internal cutaneous nerve, by one or more filaments. Se"s^eral other small cutaneous branches may also be observed when a careful dissection of the axilla is made. Besides the intercosto-humeral nerve, just described, several of the posterior cutaneous tranches of the intercostal nerves will be met with in this dissection. They are, however, quite small. They perforate the intercostal muscles below the second intercostal space, and are lost in the integument. The Serratus Magnus, Fig. 95 (5, e, 7), is a very broad Fig. 95.

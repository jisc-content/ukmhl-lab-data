503 ANTERIOR PART OF THE THIGH. Fig. 212. emerging between its anterior border and_ the tendon of the gracilis, opposite the internal condyle. It increases somewhat in breadth as it descends to the lower part of the thigh. Its fibres are the longest in the body. Its action is first to flex the leg on the thigh, and then the thigh on the pelvis, and, at the same time, draw the limb across the other. The gracilis may be dissected next, as its dissection will involve no im- portant vessel or nerve. The Gracilis, Fig. 211 (i s), arises by a thin, flat tendon, from the body and ramus of the pubic bone by the side of the symphysis, descends on the inner side of the thigh and knee-joint, and is inserted into the inner side of the tuberclet)f the tibia. It dimi n ishes in width from above downwards; its borders look forwardsand backwards; and it becomes tendinous a short dis- tance above the knee. Its action is to flex the leg on the thigh and move it towards the opposite limb. The sartorius and gracilis may now be detached at their origins and turned downwards; and also the tensor vaginae femoris. They must be preserved for the purpose of re- placing them at a future time to study their relations to other parts. On raising the sartorius, the middle cutaneous nerve will be seen perfo- rating it. The next stage of the dissection will include the femoral artery and its branches, the femoral vein, and . the branches of the anterior crural nerve under the fascia lata. To expose these satisfactorily will re- A Vietv of the Anterior Crural Nervk and Branchk-s.â€”1. Place of emer- gence of the nerve under Poupart's ligament. 2.

Between the middle and lateral ligaments, these cartilages are connected by quite a dense structure, called the crico-thyroid me^nhrane, Fig. 79 (i i). The cricoid and arytenoid are connected by two capsular LIGAMENTS, Fig. 78 (8,8), wliich contain synovial membranes. These articulations allow of very free movement to the ary- tenoid cartilages. The CnoEDiE Yogales, or Thyro-arytenoid Ligaments, Fig. 81 (e, 6), consist of two on each side, one above the other. The inferior are sometimes called the true vocal ligaments, on account of their containing much more fibrous structure than the superior. They are composed of the yellow elastic

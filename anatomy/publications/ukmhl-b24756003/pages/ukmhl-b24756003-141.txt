INTERNAL EAR, OB LABYRINTH. 12 then leaves it, returns by a bony canal into the tympanum and ffoes forwards between the handle of the malleus and lono- process of the incus, to a small foramen close by the Glalerian fissure. After leaving the portio dura, it is called the cliorda tympani. The Nerve of Jacobson, from the glosso-pharyngeal, enters the tympanum just below the promontory, and after ^ving off the following branches leaves it through an osseous canal in the upper and anterior part near the hiatus Fallopu: Fig. 45.

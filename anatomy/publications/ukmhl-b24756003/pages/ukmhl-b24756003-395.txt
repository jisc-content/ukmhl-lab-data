387 THE STOMACH. slioiilcl be removed first. To do this, apply two ligatures around the jejunum, at its commencement, and also two around the lower end of the sigmoid flexure of the colon, and divide the intestine between the ligatures at each place. To detach them will require a division of the mesentery, the meso-cascum, and the meso-colon, including the omentum majus. These may be laid aside until the stomach and duo- denum have been removed and examined. To remove the stomach, apply two ligatures to the duode- num, about an inch from the pylorus, and divide it between them; then apply a ligattire to the oesophagus as it passes through the diaphragm, and divide it above the ligature. The spleen may be taken out with the stomach, or by itself. The pancreas and the remaining portion of the duo- denum should be removed together. In dissecting them out, care should be taken not to injure the aorta and vena cava. The stomacb and the intestines should be emptied of their contents, and thoroughly cleansed before they are examined. This may be done by filling them repeatedly with water, or by allowing the water to flow through them from the stop- cock of a hydrant. The Stomach. To study tbe external appearance of the stomach it should be inflated. It has - a conical form, being curv- ed upon itself. Its cqjex is cylindrical, and joins the duodenum, where there is a slight constric- tion. Its base is rounded, and projects from two to three inches beyond the cardiac orifice. This por- tion has been designated the great cul-de-sac, or great tuberosity, Fig. 160, c, of the stomach.

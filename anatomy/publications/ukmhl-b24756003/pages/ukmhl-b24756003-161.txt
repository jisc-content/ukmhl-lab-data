DISSECTION OF THE TONGUE. 153 and a dense fibrous layer beneath the mucous membrane of the dorsum. Fig. 58. The Intrinsic Muscles of the tongue consist of muscular fibres having a longitudinal, transverse, and vertical direc- tion. The longitudinal fibres are situated near its upper and Fig. 58.

Their origin and termina- tion are not very distinct. The transverse, Fig, 59 (10), and vertical fibres are seen throughout the substance of the tongue; the former passing from one side to the other, and the latter from the dorsal to the under surface. The extrinsic muscles are those which have their origin outside of the body the tongue. They are the following:—

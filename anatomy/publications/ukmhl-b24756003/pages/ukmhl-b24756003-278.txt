270 THE UPPER EXTREMITY. Fig. 117. cales. It extends all tlie fingers. The extensor minimi digiti, Fig. 116 (o), may be considered a part of this muscle, having the same origin, course, and insertion. Its tendon may pass through a separate canal beneath the annular liga- ment. The Extensor Carpi Ulnaris, Fig. 116 (i o), arises from the external condyle, from the aponeurosis around it, and from the ulna below the insertion of the anconeus. It becomes entirely tendinous near the carpus, passes through a groove be- hind the styloid process of the ulna and a separate canal beneath the an- nular ligament, and is inserted into the base of the metacarpal bone of the little finger. It extends the hand, and adducts it. As an extensor, it acts in conjunction with the radio-carpal ex- tensors; as an adductor of the hand it co-operates with the flexor carpi ulnaris, although, as an extensor, it opposes this muscle. The student will meet with some difficulty in separating the extensor muscles in the upper part of the fore- arm, on account of their arising from the same aponeurosis and intermuscu- lar septa. When they are separated from each other the dissection will necessarily appear rough and uneven. The remaining five muscles on the back of the forearm are deep-seated, and, except the anconeus^ small, com- pared with those which have been dis- sected. The arteries are the posterior interosseous and the radial, together with some small branches on the dor- Thf Deep Layer op Muscles on the Posteihor Aspect of the Forearm.â€” 1 The lowlr part of the humerus. 2.

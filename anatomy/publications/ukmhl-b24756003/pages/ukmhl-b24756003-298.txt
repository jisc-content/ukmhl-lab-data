290 MEDULLA SPINALIS. posterior. TTie gray substance in tlie anterior cornu has been called the substantia gelatinosa; and that in the posterior, the substantia spongiosa. The two halves of the cord are united by a gray commissure at the bottom of the posterior median fis- sure, and a white commissure at the bottom of the anterior median fissure. The relative proportions of the gray and white substance vary somewhat in differ- ent sections of the cord. The precise manner in which the spinal nerves are connected with the substance of the cord, is not well understood. The anterior and posterior roots approach each other as they proceed from the cord to the foramina in the dura mater, Fig. 126 (s, 9, 10, 11), through which they pass sepa- rately. The posterior root or fasciculus of each nerve enters a ganglion^ Fig. 127 (3), in the intervertebral foramen ; and almost immediately after passing through the ganglion it joins the anterior fasciculus, and is inclosed with it in the same neuri- lemma, which is derived from the dura mater. The fasciculi increase in length from above downwards before they per- forate the fibrous sheath of the cord. The posterior roots are sensor, and are larger than the anterior, which are motor, Fig. 127 (1, 2). Each set is supposed to contain filaments, which belong to both the excito-motor and the cerebro-spinal system of nerves. Transverse Section of the Spinal Cord.—a.

481 VAGINA. distensible, as is shown in parturition. A part of the fibres of the levatores ani muscles, Fig. 203 (4), are spread out on the sides of the vagina. The Sphincter VAGiNiE Muscle, Fig. 203 (a), surrounds the vagina close to its external orifice. It is exposed by re- moving the integument from the perineum and labia majora. Its fibres arise from the centre of the perineum, and, passing upwards and forwards on the sides of the vagina, are inserted into the corpora cavernosa of the clitoris, some fibres passing on to the suspensory ligament. This muscle is narrow at its origin and insertion, but spreads out on the parietes of the vagina. It corresponds to the ejaculator urinas in the penis. Its action is to constrict the anterior orifice of the vagina. It also compresses the glands of Bartholine or the vulvo-vaginal glands^ two small bodies situated, one on each side, between Fig. 203.

99 THE EYEBALL. The cavernous sinus, Fig. 24, contains the same nerves as the sphenoidal fissure, before any division has taken place. They are situated, except the sixth, between the serous and fibrous layers of its upper wall, the third being on the inner side and the ophthalmic on the outer, with the fourth m the Fig. 24. A Tbansyerse Section op the Cavernous Sinus op the Right Side.—1. The dura mater, splitting to inclose the vessels and nerves. 2. The internal carotid artery. 3. The sixth nerve, receiving a branch from the sympathetic. 4. The cavernous sinus. 5. The third nerve. 6. The fourth nerv^.^ 7^ The ophthalmic division of the fifth nerve. middle. Between the lamin£e of the lower part of the sinus is the internal carotid artery, with the sixth nerve lying at the outside of it. The sixth nerve is here connected with one or more filaments from the carotid plexus. Filaments may also be traced from this plexus to the other orbital nerves. The intercommunicating filaments which exist between these nerves in the cavernous sinus constitute the orbital plexus. Sect. YII.—The Eyeball. The eyeball is the special organ of vision. Its internal parts are very delicate and easily destroyed; hence the dis- section of it requires careful manipulation. The student should not, however, be discouraged if he fails in his first attempt; a little perseverance will give him the dexterity requisite to expose satisfactorily its minutest parts. The eyes of some of the lower animals may be procured for dissection. These can be obtained in a fresh condition, and, as they are larger, can be dissected with greater facility than the human eye. • It will be well to have several on hand at the same time, as the beginner, especially, may expect to destroy quite a number before he succeeds in a complete dissection. Care must be taken that they are not injured in removing them from the orbit.

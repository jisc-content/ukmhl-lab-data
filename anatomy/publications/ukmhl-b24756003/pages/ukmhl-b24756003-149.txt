Anastomosis of the branches of the fifth pair on the inferior turbinated bone. These nerves ramify between the mucous membrane and periosteum. To obtain a distinct view of them, the part should be kept for some time in dilute nitric acid; when, by separating the membrane from the bone, they can be seen from the fibrous surface. The anterior palatine nerve gives off a branch which enters the nasal fossa near the posterior extremity of the inferior turbinated bone, and ramifies in the lower part of the fossa. The internal nasal branch, Fig. 52 (7), of the ophthalmic, enters the nasal cavity through the anterior part of the eth- moid, near the crista galli, sends some twigs to the septum and outer wall, and then passes down on the inner surface of the nasal bone to its junction with the lateral cartilages of the nose, where it perforates the fibrous structure connecting the cartilage and bone, and is distributed to the integument cover- ing the nose. In its course, some filaments penetrate the bone. The arteries entering the nasal fossa consist of branches from the spheno-palatine, the infra-orbital, the palatine, the

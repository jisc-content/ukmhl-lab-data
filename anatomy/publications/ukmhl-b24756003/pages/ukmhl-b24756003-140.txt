The PoRTio Dura leaves the meatus and enters the aque- duct of Fallopius, passes forwards and outwards to communi- cate with the hiatus Fallopii, where it is joined by the vidian nerve, and presents a ganglionic enlargement; it then passes backwards and downwards over the fenestra ovalis to reach the foramen stylo-mastoideum. In its course through the tympanum it passes from the upper and anterior part of the inner wall to the lower and inner part of the posterior wall. It is connected by one or two filaments to the portio mollis. The Vidian, after passing through the hiatus Fallopii, joins the portio dura and accompanies it through the tym- panum and a short distance into the stylo-mastoid canal,

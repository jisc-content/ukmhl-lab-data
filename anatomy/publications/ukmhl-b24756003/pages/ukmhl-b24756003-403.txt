THE LARGE INTESTINE. Fig. 1G6. Esr-AHGED ViKW OF A rAIlT OP A Patch of Peyer's Glands. It shows the different forms of the individual vesicles, the zone of foramina belonging to Liebor- kiihn's follicles around each, the mouths of other of those follicles and numerous villi situated be- tween the vesicles, not upon them, and, lastly, the surrounding dark- er part of the mucous membrane beset merely with villi and fol- licles. along its concave or attacTied border, and the mucus being carefully washed off, should then be held before a strong light. The Large Intestine. The location and the relations of the large intestine, except the rectal portion, have been described. Its caliber is much larger than that of the small intestine. It is largest at its commencement, and gradually diminishes in size to the lower part of the rectum, where, just above the anus, a pouch or dilatation exists. The external appearance of the large is quite different from that of the small intestine. Instead of being smooth and cylindrical, it presents, except the rectum, a sacculated appearance, the pouches being arranged longitu- dinally in three series, and separated by the same number of smooth surfaces extending the whole length of the caecum and colon. To dissect the large intestine, it should be removed, as before mentioned, from the abdomen and inflated. As the rectum cannot be examined until the soft parts of the pelvis are dissected, it will be necessary to apply a ligature to the upper part of the rectum, and divide the intestine just above it. A small portion of the ileum should be removed with the cascum and colon. With the exception of the lower part of the rectum, the large intestine has the same number of layers in its parietes as the small.

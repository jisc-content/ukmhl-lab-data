By removing a portion of the arachnoid and pia mater above the corpus callosum, this body may be inspected before any dissection of the brain is made; its depth from the upper surface of the brain, and the distance of its anterior and posterior borders from the extremities of the cerebrum, are worthy of notice. It is important that the student obtains a distinct idea of the situation of this body in relation to the periphery of the brain, as it will assist him greatly in learn- ing and fixing in his mind the exact location of many other parts. It is the gTeat starting point in dissecting the central or figurative part of the brain from above downwards. Before commencing the dissection of the cerebrum, the student may observe the appearance and general arrangement of the convolutions of the two hemispheres. The depth of the sulci, between the convolutions, is best seen from sec-

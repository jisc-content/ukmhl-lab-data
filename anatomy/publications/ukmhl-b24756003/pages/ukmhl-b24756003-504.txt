THE LOWER EXTREMITY. 496 iliac artery, thus, closiDg the space between the ligament and the ihacus luternus and psoas magnus muscles; but between the point where the junction of the two fascijB ceases on Pou- part s ligament and the spine of the pubic bone, or rather Gimbernat's ligament, a large opening is observed between Poupart's ligament in front and the os pubis behind. In- stead of the fasci£B, however, terminating at the margin of Fig. 209. A Section of the Structures which pass beneath the Femohai, Arch.—1. Poupart's ligament. 2, 2. The iliac portion of the fascia lata, attached along the margin of the crest of the ilium, and along Poupart's ligament, as far as the spine of the OS pubis (3). 4. The pubic portion of the fascia lata, continuous at (3) with the iliac portion, and passing outwards behind the sheath of the femoral vessels to its outer border at 5, where it divides into two layers; one is continuous with the sheath of the psoas (6) and iliacus (7); the other (S) is lost upon the capsule of the hip-joint (9). 10. The anterior crural nerve, inclosed in the sheath of the psoas and iliacus. li. Gimbernat's ligament. 12. The femoral ring, within the femoral sheath. 13. The femoral vein. 14. The femoral artery: the two vessels and the ring are surrounded by the femoral sheath, and thin septa are sent between the anterior and posterior wall of the sheath, dividing the artery from the vein, and the vein from the femoral ring. this opening, they are prolonged downwards to the extent of about an inch and a half, forming a sort of a pouch open at the lower end for the passage of the femoral vessels. This pouch is divided lengthwise into three compartments or canals, Fig. 209 (m), by tivo fibrous sei^ia which passfi'om its anterior to its posterior wall. The external iliac artery passes through

OP THE ABDOMEN. 854 ment; tlius it occupies a large portion of the space on the inner side of the internal ring. The Fascia Transversalis, Fig. 150 (i i, 12, and 25, 20), is thicker and more dense in the inguinal region than in any other part of it. It adheres to Poupart's ligament throughout its whole extent; but in front of the femoral vessels the fascia is continiied an inch or more into the thigh, as will be seen in the dissection of the anatomy of crural hernia, and in front of the iliacus internus and psoas magnus muscles joins the iliac fascia. Internally it lies beneath the conjoined tendon and the rectus, being closely connected to the tendon of the transversalis. The Internal Eing, Fig. 150 (15), is situated about half Fig. 150. a View op the Abdominal Muscles and the Abdominal, oe Inguinal Canal. _1. External oblique muscle of the abdomen. 2.

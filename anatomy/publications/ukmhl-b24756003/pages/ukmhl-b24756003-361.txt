ANATOMY OF INGUINAL HERNIA, 353 The internal oblique and transversalis muscles should now be detached from Poupart's ligament, and reflected upwards Fig. 149. A View op the Deep-seated Parts concerned in InguinAl and Femoral Hernia.â€”1, 1. Integument nnd adipose tissue. 2. Integument of the scrotum. 3. Fascia superficialis abdominis and fascia lata femoris turned off. 4. External oblique muscle. 5. Its tendon. 6. Linea alba. 7. Lower part of the external ob- lique tendon divided and turned back. 8. Right testicle in the tunica vaginalis testis. 9. Internal oblique and transversalis muscles. 10. Epigastric artery and vein, as placed between the fascia transversalis and the peritoneum. 11. Points to the surface of the peritoneum through the internal ring. 12. Cord covered by the cremaster muscle lying in the inguinal canal. 13. External ring laid open. 14, 15. Infundibuliform fascia of the vessels laid open so as to expose them. 16. Pec- tineus muscle. 17. The vessels in their sheath. 18. Penis and ligamentum sus- pensorium. 19, 19. Testicle and cord in its entire length. from the fascia transversalis. By making these muscles tense, a good idea may be obtained of the extent and manner in which they enter into the formation of the posterior wall of the inguinal canal. As the tendon of the transversalis curves downwards, it expands, so as to be inserted into the linea pectinea, and for some distance into Poupart's liga- 30*

THE LOWER EXTREMITY. 506 Fig. 213. ternal. It passes almost directly backwards between the pectmeus and the capsular ligament of the hip-joint. It cannot be followed further at the present time. Besides the circumflex the pro- funda gives off three or four 'perfo- rating Iranches, Fig. 190 (19), Fig. 213 (is). These pass through the adductor magnus and are expended on the back of the thigh. Some- times the J arise by a common trunk. The veins correspond to the ar- teries just described. The vein which accompanies the profunda artery lies between it and the fe- moral artery. In dissecting the arteries the veins may be cut away. The arteries should be pre- served until the muscles have been dissected, so that their relations to the muscles may be observed. The quadriceps extensor cruris may now be examined. As its name indicates it is a muscle hav- ing four heads. These are usually described as separate muscles. They are named the rectus femoris, the vasti externus and internus, and the crureus. They cover nearly the whole of the anterior and lateral surfaces of the femur. To expose these muscles divide the fascia lata along the middle A Front Vie-w op the Femoral Artery, as well as op the Primitive and External Iliac of the Right Side.â€”1. Primitive iliac artery. 2.

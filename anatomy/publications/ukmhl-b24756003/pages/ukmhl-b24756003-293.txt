The metacarpal bones of the fingers are connected to the carpus by dorsal and jpal- mar ligaments. The former are stronger than the latter. The metacarpal bones are united at their carpal extremi- ties by dorsal and palmar tramverse ligaments, and also by interosseous fibres. Their phalangeal extremities are connected to each other by three hose transverse fibrous bands. Each metacarpal bone is connected to its corresponding phalangeal bone by an anterior and two lateral ligaments. The anterior ligament is joined to the lateral ligaments on its sides. Anteriorly it is grooved for the tendons of the flexor muscles of the fingers, the sheaths of which are attached to it on each side of the groove. The lateral ligaments of the thumb are very strong, and sometimes contain sesamoid bones. The articulations of the phalangeal bones have each an anterior and two lateral ligaments. They require no particular description. The synovial membranes, Fig. 125, about the wrist should be carefully examined. There are five distinct capsules.

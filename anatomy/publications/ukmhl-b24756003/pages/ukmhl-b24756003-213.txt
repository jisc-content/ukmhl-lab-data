205 OF THE PHARYNX, border of the ala of the thyroid cartilage, passes upwards to form the posterior half-arch of the palate, and then spreads out to be inserted into the median line of the palate, with its fellow on the opposite side.

The Pharyngeal Aponeurosis is thick and strong at the upper part of the pharynx, where it serves to connect its muscular walls to the base of the cranium, and to complete them in this part of it. As it descends, it gradually becomes thinner, until it ends in areolar tissue. It is situated between the mucous membrane and muscular layer. The arteries of the pharynx are obtained principally from the ascending pharyngeal; it also receives small branches from, the superior thyroid, the palatine and the pharyngeal branches of the internal maxillary. The nerves come from the pharyngeal plexus, which con- sists of sensor and involuntary motor filaments derived from the glosso-pharyngeal, pneumogastric, and sympathetic. The pharynx is separated from the vertebrte by the longus colli and rectus capitis anticus major muscles. The anatomy of the trachea and oesophagus will be described, the former in connection with the bronchi and lungs, and the latter with the contents of the mediastinum. 18

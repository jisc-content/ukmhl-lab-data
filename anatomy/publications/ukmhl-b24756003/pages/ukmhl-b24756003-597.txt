DISSECTION OF THE SOLE OF THE FOOT. 589 A View of the Arteries on THE Back of the Right Leg and THEIR CONTINUATION ON TO THE Sole of the Foot.—rl, 1, 1, 1. Tendons of the flexor communis and flexor longus polUcis pedis. 2. Tendon of the peroneus longus. 3. Posterior tibial artery at the ankle. 4,4. External and internal plantar arteries. 5. Points where the external plantar dips to form the plantar arch. 6. Peroneal ar- tery, just above the origin of the external malleolar branch. 7. A branch to anastomose with the posterior tibial. 8. .lust above the division of the peroneal artery into its anterior and posterior branches. The Deep-seated Branches op the Ar- teries ON the Sole op the Foot.—1. Poste- rior tibial artery by the side of the astragalus. 2. Branches to the os calcis. 3. Branch of the posterior peroneal artery. 4. Bifurcation of the posterior tibial into the internal and external plantar. 5. The external plantar artery. 6. Point where it forms the plantar arch. 7. Anastomosis of the anterior tibial with the plantar arch. 8, 9, 10. Muscular branches of the external plantar artery. 11. Anastomosis of this artery with the metatarsal. 12, 13. External digital of the little toe. 14. Digital arteries of the other toes. 15,15,15,15. Their distribution on the toes. 16. Origin of the internal plantar artery. 17. Its anasto- mosis with the plantar arch. 18,19, 20. Mus- cular branches of the internal plantar artery. 21. Digital of the great toe, or arteria magna pollicis, as formed by tho anastomosis of the internal plantar and plantar arch. 22. Sub- articular branch of the great toe. 23. Anasto- mosis in the pulp of the toe. osseous spaces, each artery gives off an anterior perforating branch which passes upwards through an interosseous space, and anastomoses with a corresponding interosseous branch. 50

The Ceico-Arytenqideus Posticus, Fig. 83 (s), arises from the posterior surface of the cricoid cartilage, passes obliquely upwards and outwards to be inserted into a pro- cess on the posterior and oiiter side of the base of the aryte- noid cartilage. The Arytenoideus, Fig. 83 (i i), consists of transverse and oblique fibres. The latter are superficial, and extend from the base of one cartilage to the apex of the other. The former pass from the posterior surface of one cartilage to that of the other. The last-named muscles are exposed by simply removing the mucous membrane and some areolar tissue which covers them posteriorly. The Thyro-Epiglottici and Aryteno-Epiglottici, are composed of a few pale, muscular fibres, passing, the former from the thyroid, and the latter from the arytenoid carti- lages to the epiglottis, within the folds of mucous mem-

OF THE NOSE. 135 ethmoid, aud its posterior inferior border is received between the edges of the vomer and the palatine processes of the superior maxillaa; its anterior border is connected to the nasal suture and to the two inferior lateral cartilages. It sometimes projects back- wards between the ethmoidal lamella and the vomer to the rostrum of the sphenoid bone. The superior lateral cartilage^ Fig. 47 (i), on each side is attached above to the lower border of the nasal bone, poste- riorly to the nasal process of the superior maxilla, below to the inferior lateral car- tilage of the same side, and in the median line to the septal cartilage; the two car- tilages are not directly attached to each other at their anterior margins. The anterior margin is thicker than the pos- terior. They are of a triangular shape. The inferior lateral or View of the Carti- lages OF THE Nose, LOOKING INTO THE NOS- TRILS PROJI BELOW. 2.

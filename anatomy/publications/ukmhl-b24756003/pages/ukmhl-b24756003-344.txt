DISSECTION OF THE THORAX. 838 vertebras and their intervertebral substance. The ribs are also joined, by their tubercles, to the transverse processes of the vertebras. The head of each rib is connected to two bodies of the vertebras and the intervertebral substance, by an anteeior COSTO-VERTEBRAL, or STELLATE LIGAMENT, Fig. 144 (2), and an INTEROSSEOUS LIGAMENT, Fig. 144 (4). The first arises from the head of the rib in front, and is inserted, by three fasciculi, into the bodies of the vertebrge and the intermediate substance. The second arises from the angle between the facets on the head of the rib, and is inserted into the intervertebral sub- stance. The first and the two last ribs have no interosseous ligaments, and, consequently, each one has but a single syno- vial sac, while each of the others have two. The ribs are connected to the transverse processes by three ligaments, viz: The anterior, or internal costo-transverse, the posterior, or external costo-transverse, and the middle costo- transverse, or interosseous ligament.

About a fourth of an inch A Vertical Section of the Middle Part of the Nasal Fossje, giving a pos- terior view OP THE arrangement OP THE ETHMOIDAL Cells, &c.—1. Anterior fossa of the cranium. 2. The same covered by the dura mater. 3. The dura mater turned up. 4. The crista galli of the ethmoid bone. 5. Its cribriform plate. 6. Its nasal lamella. 7, 7. The middle spongy bones. 8. The ethmoidal cells. 9. The OS planum. 10. Inferior spongy bone. 11. The vomer. 12. Superior maxillary bone. 1.3. Its union with the ethmoid. 14. Anterior parietes of the antrum High- morianum, covered by its membrane. 15. Its fibrous layer. 16. Its mucous mem- brane. 17. Palatine process of the superior maxillary bone. 18. Roof of the mouth covered by the mucous membrane. 19. Section of this membrane. A bristle is seen in the orifice of the antrum Highmorianum. behind the nasal spine, and close to the septum nasi, is situ- ated the foramen incisivum, or anterior palatine foramen. The relation of the external orifice of the Eustachian tube, Fig. 50 (s), to the nasal cavity, should be noticed in the pre- pared skull, but more particularly in the recent subject, witli reference to the introduction of an instrument into it through the nasal fossa. To examine the nasal fossae in the recent subject, the head must be divided vertically, as was mentioned in connection with the prepared cranium. A fine saw without any back is best for this purpose. The nasal foss£e are lined by a mucous membrane, which is continued into the sphenoidal, frontal, and maxillary sinuses, and ethmoidal cells; it is continuous through the lachrymal passages with the conjunctiva; with the mucous membrane of the pharynx and Eustachian tubes through the posterior nares, ■ • )V((!

The mucous membrane and fibrous tissue are prolonged into the lobular tubes, with which the cells communicate directly. The cells are not lined by mu- cous membrane, but have a thin, delicate, fibrous lamina forming their walls, upon which the capillaries of the pul- monary vessels ramify. JEach lobule is composed of a cluster of air-cells, which communicate with a tube common to them; of pulmonary

THE FACE. 83 The nerves, Fig. 63, consist of the Malar, Buccal, and Max- illary branches of the facial. Fig. 3. A ViE-w- OF THE Saltvabt Glaitds in situ.â€”1. The parotid gland in situ, and extending from the zygoma ahove to the angle of the jaw below. 2. The duct of Steno. 3. The submaxillary gland. 4. Its duct. 5. Sublingual gland. The Malar Branches pass upwards and forwards to ramify principally in the orbicularis palpebrarum and corru- gator supercilii muscles, and the eyelids. The filaments which ascend above the orbit form anastomotic connections with the supra-orbital of the fifth pair. The Buccal Branches cross the masseter muscle close to the duct of Steno. They divide into deep and superficial tranches. The superficial can be traced beneath the skin to the upper lip, the nose, and the lower eyelid. They supply filaments to the orbicularis oris, the zygomatic! major and minor, the levator labii superioris, and the pyramidalis nasi. The deep branches send filaments mostly to the remaining muscles, and form a plexus, as well as interlace and anasto- mose with the infra-orbital of the fifth pair. They also anastomose with the internal and external nasal branches of the ophthalmic nerve. The Maxillary Branches pass over the lower part of the masseter, and proceed forwards to the chin. They give filaments to the masseter, the buccinator, the depressor

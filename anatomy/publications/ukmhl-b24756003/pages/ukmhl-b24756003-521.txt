THE GLUTEAL REGION. 513 maximus is fairly ex- posed and properly stu- died it shoiTld be care- fully raised by detaching- it from its origin and reflecting it downwards. As it is raised, the glu- teal artery and nerve, and the gluteal branch- es of the sciatic artery and lesser sciatic nerve will be found entering the muscle upon its un- der surface. The glu- teus medius should now be dissected and studied. The Gluteus Mediusi Fig. 216 (e), arises from the dorsum of the ilium between the middle and superior semicircular ridges and the crest of the ilium. That portion of it not covered by the gluteus maximus has a very thick dense aponeu- rosis, from the under surface of which many of its fibres arise. Its fibres converge to form a short thick tendon, which is inserted into the outer part of the tro- chanter major. It will be observed that the di- rection of the fibres of this muscle, viewed in relation to the hip-joint, is quite different from that of the fibres of the preceding muscle; that Fig. 216.

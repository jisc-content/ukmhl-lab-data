DISSECTION OF THE LIVER. 401 stance of tlie liver by numerous prolongations sent off be- tween the lobules. The student should trace the portal vein, the hepatic artery and duct, or, at least, their principal divisions, in the substance of the liver; also the hepatic veins. The vena portce enters the transverse fissure of the liver and divides into a right and left branch, forming at this di- vision the portal sinus. The branches enter the liver, and divide and subdivide until every part of the organ is reached. The subdivisions of it are named, the vaginal^ the interlobular^ and the lobular. The hepatic artery enters the liver with the vena portae, and divides into the same number of branches as it. Its subdivisions are named the vaginal^ the interlobular, and the lobular. The hepatic duct accompanies the vein and artery in its Fig. 171. H. Longitudinal section of an hepatic vein. a, a. Por- tions of the canal from which the vein has been removerl. h.

The spaces occupied by the portal vein, artery, and duct, are called the porlaL canals. 34*

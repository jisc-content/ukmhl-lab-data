DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 136 alar cartilages, Fig. 48, c, c, nearly surround the anterior nares; the outer and posterior part of each is narrow, but is en- larged anteriorly to form with its fellow on the opposite side the apex of the nose. Each projects backwards below the septal cartilage to assist in forming the columna. Behind where their outer portions are attached by dense fibrous tissue to the maxilla, are usually on each side two or three small cartilages, called the sesamoid cartilages. The inner portion of each alar cartilage is connected behind to the nasal spine. The lower parts of the alas of the nose are formed by dense areolar tissue. The Nasal Fossae should be studied in the first place in a prepared skull, which has been divided by a vertical sec- tion made a little to one side of the median line, so as to leave the osseous septum entire, A knowledge of the nasal fossse is too important to be neglected by the student. If he be familiar with the osseous walls of these cavities, he will encounter very little difficulty in dissecting and understand- ing the soft parts connected with them. Each nasal fossa is somewhat wedge-shaped; the thin edge looks upwards, and is rounded off anteriorly and posteriorly, to correspond to the arched roof of this cavity. The inner wall, Fig. 49, is formed above by the vertical Fig. 49.

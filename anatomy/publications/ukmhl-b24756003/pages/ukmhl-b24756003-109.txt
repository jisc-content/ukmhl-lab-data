It diminishes in thickness from behind forwards to its anterior border. In children of strumous diathesis, the anterior part of it, which is known as the white of the eye, is sometimes so thin and translucent that it presents a bluish tint from the choroid coat showing through it. It is of a dense fibrous structure, consisting of white and yellow elastic tissue; the fibres run- ning in every direction. Its great strength may be tested by an attempt to tear it in any direction. This unyielding character is the cause of great pain in some diseases of the eye. Its connection with the cornea is very firm, requiring maceration for some time to effect a separation. The margin of the sclerotica is beveled from within outwards, so as to overlap the margin of the cornea, which is beveled in the op- posite direction. This overlapping reaches a little further above and below than at either side, thus causing an appa- rent difference in the transverse and vertical diameters of the cornea. The external surface of the sclerotica is in relation 9*

DISSECTION OF THE BLADDER. 423 Fig. 180. called the trigone, will be observed in tbe lower and posterior part of the bladder. The trigone^ or vesical triangle^ Fig. 180 (7), is the small space between the three orifices of the bladder. The rugos, which are seen in other parts of the blad- der, are here absent, the surface being smooth, with the excep- tion of some fine strise, which are directed towards the orifice of the urethra. The oi-ifices of the ureters, Fig. 180 (3, 3), which appear like small slits in the mucous mem- brane, are situated at the pos- terior angles of the trigone. The distance between them varies ac- cording as the bladder has been contracted or distended. A probe should be passed through the orifice of one of the ureters, to show the obliqiie manner in which it perforates the coats of the bladder. It will be found to traverse three-fourths of an inch or more of the cellular layer after perforating the muscular coat. This arrangement prevents the contents of the bladder, even when it is filled with air, from passing into the ureters. 20 zr The Bladder and Urethra of a Man laid open in its avhole Length.â€”1, 1.

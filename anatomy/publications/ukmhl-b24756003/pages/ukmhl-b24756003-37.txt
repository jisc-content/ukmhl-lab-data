PART I. DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. CHAPTER I. OF THE HEAD. Sect. I.â€”Of the Face. The Face is bounded above by the root of the nose, eye- brows, and the zygomata; laterally, by the ears and mastoid processes; below, by the base of the lower jaw, and a line drawn from its angle to the apex of the mastoid process on each side. As the face is symmetrical, it will be sufl&cient to describe one side. The student, however, may attend more especially to the dissection of the muscles on one side, and to the vessels and nerves on the other. It is conve- nient to consider the face as divided into several regions; as the Parotid, the Masseteric, the Buccal, the Mental, the Labial, the Nasal, the Orbital, and the Malar. The location of each of these divisions is indicated by its name. It is not neces- sary for our present purpose to define their boundaries. To dissect the face, the head must be placed in a suitable position, and changed from time to time, as may be found most convenient. The lips and cheeks should be made tense by inserting beneath them tow or cotton, and then stitching the lips together; the nose and eyelids should also be made tense in the same manner. The integument should be raised from below upwards, and from behind forwards. For this purpose make an incision, commencing at the symphysis of the chin, along the base of the lower jaw to its angle, and thence to the apex of the mastoid process, and from this point extend it upwards in front of the ear to the zygoma, and across above the eyebrow to the root of the nose; make another incision in the median line from the symphysis of the 3*

LIGAMENTS OF THE THORAX. 837 is found between the tubercles of the ribs and the transverse processes. The Internal Costo-Transverse Ligament, Fig. 145 (3) , arises from the inferior border of the transverse process, passes obliquely downwards, and is inserted into the neck of the rib immediately below. This ligament is absent in the articulation of the first rib. The External Costo-Transverse Ligament, Fig. 145 (4) , extends obliquely from the apex of the transverse process to the tubercle of the rib. The Middle Costo-Transverse, or Interosseous Liga- ment, passes from the transverse process directly to the pos- terior part of the cervix of the rib. Its fibres are usually intermixed with more or less adipose tissue, and cannot be distinctly seen without making a section of the rib. 29

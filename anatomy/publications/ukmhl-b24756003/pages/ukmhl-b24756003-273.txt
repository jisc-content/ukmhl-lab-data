DISSECTION OF THE FOREARM. 265 Fig. 113. common. It is important to understand the position of this iartery in bleeding at the bend of the arm. The ulnar artery is accompanied by its venae comites. The Ulnar Nerve, Fig. 113 (3), enters the forearm through the notch between the internal con- dyle and olecranon process, and be- tween two heads of the flexor carpi ulnaris. It then passes obliquely beneath the inner head, to join the ulnar artery at the junction of the upper with the middle third of the forearm. It accompanies the artery in the rest of its course, being situ- ated on the ulnar side. It sends articular filaments to the joint as it passes over it; muscular branches to the flexor carpi ulnaris, and flexor profundus digitorum; and cutaneous branches, one to the front of the lower part of the forearm and hand, and another to the dorsum of the same parts. The latter branch leaves it about two inches above the carpus, and passing beneath the flexor carpi ulnaris, Fig. 118 (e), gets round to the back of the wrist and hand, where it divides into several branches, which are distributed to the little and ring fingers. It also anasto- moses with the radial. The Median Nerve, Fig. 113 (1), after passing between the two heads of the pronator radii teres, goes down the middle of the forearm between the flexor sublimis in front, and the flexor profundus behind, to within about two inches of the wrist, where it gets on the outer side of the tendons of the flexor sublimis, and becomes superficial. It passes beneath the annular ligament to en- 23 a View op the Nerves on the front of the forearm. 1. The median nerve. 2. Ante- rior branch of the musculo-spiral or radial nerve. 3.

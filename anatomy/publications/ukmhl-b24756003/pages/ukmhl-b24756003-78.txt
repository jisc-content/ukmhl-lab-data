Its superior and inferior surfaces are separated by a well marked border, and a deep horizontal fissure. It presents two notches, one before for the tubercula quadri- gemina and the crura cerebelli, and one behind for the falx eerebelli and inferior occipital ridge. The posterior notch terminates below and anteriorly in an excavation which cor- responds to the medulla oblongata. The two hemispheres are united by a median Zo&e, the upper part of which is termed the superior vermiform "process, and the lower part the inferior vermiform process. The upper sur- face is sloping from the centre, while the under surface of each hemisphere is convex, and separated by a deep depres- sion, named the vallecula, or valley. The superior surface, Fig. 14, of each hemisphere presents two lobes; an anterior, or square lobe, and a posLerior, or semi- Fig. 14. A View of the Superior Face op the Cerebelltim.â€”1,1.

The two anterior lobes are connected to each other by the transverse lammte of the superior vermiform process, which is situated between them. The two posterior lobes are separated from each other by the posterior notch, but are connected to each other by trans- verse bands at the bottom of the notch. These lobes consist of lobules, which again are composed of laminas.

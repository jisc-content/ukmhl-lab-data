Fig. 217 (7, 7), is a branch of the internal ihac. It leaves the pelvis through the lower part of the great sacro-sciatic notch, be- low the pyriforrnis. In the first part of its course, it gives off branches to the gluteus maxi- mus, some of which pass through the muscle, and supply the in- tegument over it. One or more branches, named coccygeal, usu- ally perforate the great sacro- sciatic ligament, and ramify on the dorsum of the sacrum, and in the coccygeal region. An- other branch, called the comes nervi ischiadici, goes to the great sciatic nerve, and accompanies it for some distance down the thigh.

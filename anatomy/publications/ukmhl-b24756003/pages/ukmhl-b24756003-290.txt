THE UPPER EXTREMITY. 282 coronoid process, and the annular ligament. The removal of this ligament affords a very good view of the interior of the joint. Fig. 122. An Internal View op the Elbow- Joint.—1. The anterior ligament. 2. The internal lateral ligament. 3. The coronary ligament. 4. The ligamentum teres. 5. The interosseous ligament. 6. The internal condyle, which conceals the posterior ligament behind. Fig. 123. An External View op the Elbow- Joint.—1. The humerus. 2. The ulna. 3. The radius. 4. The external lateral ligament. 5. The coronary ligament. 6. The insertion of the coronary liga- ment at the posterior part of the lessor sigmoid cavity of the ulna. 7. The an- terior ligament. 8. The posterior liga- ment. 9. The interosseous ligament of the forearm. The Posterior Ligament, Fig. 123 (s), consists of but little more than condensed areolar tissue. The fibres which it contains pass in different directions between the humerus and the ulna. The Annular or Orbicular Ligament, Fig. 122 (3), sur- rounds the cervix of the radius. It is attached to the extre- mities of the small sigmoid cavity of the ulna. The synovial membrane is prolonged from the upper part of the joint

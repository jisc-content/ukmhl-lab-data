THE UrPER EXTEEMITY. 240 wards, to be lost in tlie tendon of tlie supra-spinatus muscle. Removing this fascia, the muscle will be exposed. It ames from the surface of the whole fossa, except the anterior part, and also from the under surface of the fascia, posteriorly. It passes beneath the acromion process, and ends in a tendon which is inserted into the upper part of the great tuberosity of the humerus. Its tendon is blended with the capsular ligament of the joint, over which it passes. There is a great deal of loose areolar tissue situated around this muscle, where it passes under the acromion process and the coraco-acromial ligament. It assists the deltoid in raising the arm, and, when it is raised, prevents the head of the humerus from being displaced into Fig. 100. 1 A Posterior View of the Muscles of the Shotflder, with the Deltoid.â€” 1.

Its middle portion forming the round part of the shoulder. the axilla, by keeping it firmly applied to the glenoid cavity; it also draws the capsular ligament from beneath the acromion process, when the head of the humerus is pressed against it. In raising the supra-spinatus, the supra-scapular artery and nerve are to be traced. They are continued into the infra- spinata fossa by passing under the acromion process, where they will be met with when the infra-spmatus muscle is dis- sected The nerve usually passes through the coracoid notch, to enter the' supra-spinata fossa, while the artery generally passes over the ligament which subtends this notch and cou-

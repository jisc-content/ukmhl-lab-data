DISSECTION OP THE ISTECK. 178 artery and vein, and tlie anterior projection of the ffland Irom the cutaneous surface of the mylo-hyoideus, the origin and insertion of this muscle will be exposed The Mylo-Hyoideus, Fig. 69 (5), is a broad muscle, and irom Its important relations deserves special notice. It arises Fig. 69. The Muscles of the Anterior Aspect op the Neck ; on the left bide the Superficial Muscles are seen, and on the right the Deep.â€”1. The posterior belly of the digastricus muscle. 2. Its anterior belly. The aponeurotic pulley, through which its tendon is seen passing, is attached to the body of the os hyoides. 3, 4. The stylo-hyoideus muscle, transfixed by the posterior belly of the digastricus. 5. The mylo-hyoideus. 6. The genio-hyoideus. 7. The tongue. 8. The hyo- glossus. 9. The stylo-glossus. 10. The stylo-pharyngeus. 11. The sterno-mastoid muscle. 12. Its sternal origin. 13. Its clavicular origin. 14. The sterno-hyoid. 15. The sterno-thyroid of the right side. 16. The thyro-hyoid. 17. The hyoid portion of the omo-hyoid. 18, 18. Scapular portions; on the left side, the tendon of the muscle is seen to be bound down by a portion of the deep cervical fascia. 19. The clavicular portion of the trapezius. 20. The scalenus antious of the right side. 21. The scalenus posticus. from the mylo-hyoid ridge, on the inner surface of the lower jaw; its fibres pass downwards, forwards, and inwards, to be inserted into the hyoid bone, and to join its fellow on the opposite side along the median line. This muscle may draw up the hyoid bone, or, when it is fixed, may depress the lower jaw. A small triangular space, occupied by areo- lar tissue, exists between the two mylo-hyoid muscles just

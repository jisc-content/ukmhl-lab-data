OF THE PELVIS, 434 Fig. 186. until it reaches the bladder, wliere it enlarges, and becomes sacculated. The Vas Abereans, Fig. 185 (i i), is a small tube which is sometimes found arising from the globus minor, or the commencement of the vas deferens, and extending a short distance upwards in the spermatic cord. It terminates in a blind extremity. Its use is not known. The Vesiculje Seminales, Fig. 186 (7,7), are two saccu- lated bodies, situated on the base of the bladder, above the prostate gland, and in front of the rectum. They are each about two inches in length, and half an inch in breadth. They approach each other from above downwards, so as to leave a triangular space between them, in which the vasa deferentia are situ- ated. When fully dissected out, each one is found to be from four to five inches in length. They are lined by mucous membrane, outside of which is a proper fibrous layer. They also receive a layer from the prostatic fascia, which attaches them to the bladder. Each one termi- nates in a short tube, the ductus vesiculcB seminalis. The Ductus Ejaculatorius Com- munis, Fig. 181 (s), is about an inch in length. It passes forwards, up- wards, and somewhat inwards, be- tween the middle and lateral lobes of the prostate gland to open on the caput gallinaginis, in the floor of the prostatic portion of the urethra. At first the two ejaculatory ducts are a little distance apart, but lie close to each other in the latter part of their course. Their walls in the prostate gland are very thin, and some care is requisite to dissect them out entire. The Spermatic Cord is composed of the vas deferens and the spermatic vessels and nerves. It extends from the back The Posterior Aspect of THE Male Bladder; the se- rous COVERING IS REMOVED IJJ order TO SHOW THE MUSCDLAB Coat.â€”1. The body of the blad- der. 2. Its fundus. 3.

SUPERFICIAL PARTS OF THE NECK. Fig. 67. 173 The coirnsE anb distribution of the Hypoglossal or Ninth Pair of Nerves. The deep-seated Nertes of the Neck are also seen.â€”1. The hypoglossal nerve. 2. Branches communicating with the gustatory nerve. 3. A branch to the origin of the hyoid muscles. 4. The descendens noni nerve. 5. The loop formed with the branch from the cervical nerves. 6, 6. Muscular branches to the depressor muscles of the larynx. 7. A filament from the second cervical nerve, and 8. A filament from the third cervical, uniting to form the communicating branch with the loop from the descendens noni. 9. The auricular nerve. 10. The inferior dental nerve. 11. Its mylo-hyoidean branch. 12. The gustatory nerve. 13. The chorda tympani passing to the gustatory nerve. 14. The chorda tympani leaving the gustatory nerve to join the submaxillary ganglion. 15. The submaxillary ganglion. 16. Filaments of communication with the lingual nerve. 17. The glosso-pharyngeal nerve. 18. The par vagum or pneumogastric nerve. 19. The three upper cervical nerves. 20. The four inferior cervical nerves. 21. The first dorsal nerve. 22, 23. The brachial plexus. 24, 25. The phrenic nerve. 26. The carotid artery. 27. The internal jugular vein. The Vertebral Artery, Fig. 68 (7), is tlie largest brancTi of the subclavian. It arises from the upper and posterior part of that artery, and passes directly up to the foramen in the transverse process of the sixth cervical vertebra, which it traverses, and also the corresponding foramina of the upper five vertebras; it enters the cranial cavity through the foramen occipitale, to be distributed to the brain and its me- ninges. In its course along the neck it sends branches to the spinal canal, and gives off also some small muscular twigs. It varies in its origin in different subjects, and on 15*

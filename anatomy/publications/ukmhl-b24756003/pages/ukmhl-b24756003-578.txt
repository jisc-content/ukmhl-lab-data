THE LOWEK EXTREMITY. 570 this braucli, instead of the musculo-cutaneous. The branch that supplies the inner part of the great toe anastomoses with the internal saphenous nerve. The other branches anastomose with the anterior tibial nerve; sometimes they are wanting, when their places are supplied by branches of the anterior tibial. The branches of the musculo-cutaneous not only supply the toes to which they Fig. 243. are distributed, bnt also the integument on the lower and forepart of the leg, and on the middle part of the dorsum of the foot. The integument on the inner part of the leg is supplied by branches of the internal saphenous, Fig. 242 (i), while the external popliteal, or the pe- roneal cutaneous. Fig. 242 (2, 2, 2), sup- ply the integument on the outer part of the leg. After removing the si? in from the dorsum of the foot, besides the nerves just noticed the superficial veins, Fig. 243, should be examined. These consist of an internal and an external dorsal vein, which are connected across the meta- tarsus so as to form an arch called the dorsal arch. The veins of the toes empty into this arch; and, also, branches from the internal and external plantar veins. The saphenous veins have their origin in this arch, or rather in the internal and external dorsal veins. There are other veins on the dorsum of the foot and on the anterior part of the leg, but they require no special notice; they ter- minate either in the internal or external saphenous vein.

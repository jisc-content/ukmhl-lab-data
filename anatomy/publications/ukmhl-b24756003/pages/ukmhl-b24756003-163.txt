STJPEKFICIAL PARTS OF THE NECK. 155 glossal is distributed to the muscles; the glosso-pharyngeal to the mucous membrane at the back part of the tongue; and the gustatory branch of the fifth to the mucous mem- brane on its sides and tip. CHAPTER II. DISSECTION" OF THE NECK. Sect. I.â€”Superficial Parts of the Neck. The posterior part of the neck should be dissected with the back, as they have several muscles in common, and also on accoiint of the similarity in the arrangement of their ves- sels and nerves. . The anterior part of the neck is a very important region, and demands the special attention of the student in the dis- secting-room. In it are found the larynx, trachea, pharynx, oesophagus, and numerous vessels and nerves. Each side is bounded above by the base of the inferior maxilla, the lower border of the parotid region, and the mastoid process of the temporal bone; posteriorly, by a line extending from the occiput, just behind the mastoid process, to the acromion process of the scapula; and below, by the acromion process and the upper border of the clavicle and sternum. The two sides are divided by the median line. One side should be dissected at a time. To dissect this region, the thorax should be elevated and the position of the head changed from time to time, as it may be found necessary to have the parts relaxed or made tense. The dissector must exercise his own judgment in determining the best position for the head in the different stages of the dissection. As a general rule, muscles should be made tense to facilitate their dissection, but sometimes, in separating them from each other, or when tracing vessels and nerves among them, it is better that they should be relaxed, so that they can be drawn to one side or lifted up. Before commencing the dissection, the student should ob-

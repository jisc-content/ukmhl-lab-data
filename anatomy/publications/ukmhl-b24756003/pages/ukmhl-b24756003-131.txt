MIDDLE EAB, OK TYMPANUM. 123 examined by allowing the rays of light to enter in a direction to fall on the membrana tympani, and to expose the whole of the interior surface of the meatus. > THE MIDDLE EAR, OR TYMPANUM. The tympanum is a small circular cavity, situated between the meatus and the labyrinth, or internal ear. It resembles somewhat a section of the meatus, or it may be regarded as a prolongation of that tube into the base of the petrous por- tion of the temporal bone, to the extent of about one-fourth of an inch. It is cut off from the meatus by a membrane, which forms its external wall, while the septum between it and the internal ear forms its internal wall. This cavity is about half an inch in diameter, which is rather greater than that of the meatus. In studying it, three surfaces are presented; its external and internal walls, and its circumference.

Its external wall is formed by the membrana tympani, and the inner margin of the parietes of the meatus. The mem- brana tympani, Fig. 40, A, B, is inclined inwards in a direction from above downwards, thus increasing the length of the floor of the meatus. It is concave externally, with its correspond- ing convexity projecting into the tympanum. It has attached to the upper part of its inner surface the handle of the malleus it 18 composed of three laminae. The outer one is reflected trom the parietes of the meatus, and the inner one from the walls of the tympanum; the middle one is fibrous, and is fixed to a groove in the circumference of the tympanic orifice of the

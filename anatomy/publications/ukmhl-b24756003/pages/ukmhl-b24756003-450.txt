442 OF THE PELVIS. Fig. ]90. The vesical arteries^ Fig. 190 (ii)) consist of two principal branches, a superior and an in- ferior. The former is usually a continuation of that part of the hypogastric artery in the foetus which, instead of being con verted into a ligamentous cord remains pervious after birth It ramifies on the back, sides, and fundus of the bladder; sometimes a branch extends upwards from the summit to- wards the umbilicus. The latter, or vesico-pj-osiatic, commonly arises directly from the internal iliac, and is distributed to the neck and lower part of the bladder, to the prostate gland, to the corresponding seminal vesicle, and the upper part of the urethra. A small branch is sent to the vas deferens, named the deferential artery; also another one to the xireter. The inferior artery of the blad- der varies very much in its origin. Besides these branches the bladder is generally suppli- ed with several small branches derived from other sources.

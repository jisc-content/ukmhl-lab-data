PART III. DISSECTION OF ABDOMEN AND LOWER EXTREMITIES. CHAPTER I. OF THE ABDOMEN. Sect. I.â€”Paeietes of the Abdomen. To dissect the parietes of the abdomen, the subject must be laid on the back, and elevated sufficiently, by means of one or more blocks placed beneath it, to render the muscles tense. The amount of elevation required will depend very much on the fulness of the abdomen, and must be deter- mined by the dissector in each case. The extent of the integument to be incised in this dissec- tion is indicated by the outlines of the external oblique muscle. If the student should wish to study the superficial fascia and the cutaneous vessels and nerves, it is immaterial how he makes his incisions for the purpose of removing the skin, as his object will be merely to uncover the fascia so as not to injure the vessels and nerves which ramify in it. But if his object be to raise the fascia with the skin, the incisions should be made with reference to the dissection of the external oblique muscle. As the fibres of this muscle are directed from above downwards and forwards, the integument must be raised so as to admit of exposing the muscle by cutting in the direc- tion of its fibres. If this rule be disregarded, and the student attempts to expose the muscle by cutting across the fibres, his dissection will necessarily be rough and unsatisfactory. Whether the skin be raised separately or with the fascia, 'it is often convenient to leave the inguinal region untouched for the purpose of making a special dissection of the parts

Origin of the spheno-palatine. The tympanic artery goes through the Glaserian fissure to the tympanum. The pterygoid branches, irregular in their origin, penetrate the internal surface of the pterygoid mus- cles. The anterior meningeal artery arises a little in advance of the middle meningeal, and passes through the foramen ovale to the dura mater. The deep temporal, masseteric, and

GENERAL REMARKS. 28 the others from proceeding when they may wish to change its position, or remove the part which they are dissecting. Nor should the dissection of a part, when once commenced, be delayed longer than is absolutely necessary, as it is liable to undergo decomposition, to become mouldy, or so dry and hard that it cannot be properly dissected. No part which is not required to be preserved for study, or for protecting other parts, should be allowed to remain attached to the subject, or to lie on the table after it has been cut ofi". Nothing contrib- utes more to the comfort of a student, when dissecting, than to have a clean table; hence he should be particular to see that scraps or fluids do not collect on the table or fall on the floor around it. It is not necessary, perhaps, even to allude to the importance of personal cleanliness in the dissecting- room. Every student should be provided with a gown, or a change of garments, so as to prevent his clothes being soiled. To be able to dissect properly and satisfactorily, it is indis- pensably necessary to have good instruments. Whether they cost a little more or a little less should have no influence on the mind of the student when making a purchase, provided they are good. I have repeatedly known students to become disgusted with dissecting for no other reason than their attempting it with poor instruments. But, however good they may be, they will become dull in using them, and re- quire to be sharpened. This should be done as often as may be found necessary, as it is impossible to make a good dissection with a dull instrument. It should be recollected that the dissecting-room is a place appropriated to study as well as to dissecting, and that con- sequently it is desirable that quietness should be observed by those who are engaged in it. The importance of this must be apparent to every one who has had any experience in the dissecting-room.

MIDDLE EAK, OR TYMPANUM. i^O the tympanum. The osseous portion of this tube is separated from the canal for the tensor tympani muscle by the septum Fig. 41. A DiAGHAM OP THE Eab.—p. The pinna. <. The tympanum. I. The laby- rinth. 1. The upper part of the helix. 2. The anti-helix. 3. The tragus. 4. The anti-tragus. 5. The lobulus. 6. The concha. 7. The upper part of the fossa innominata. 8. The meatus. 9. The membrana tympani, divided by the section. 10. The three little bones, crossing the area of the tympanum, malleus, incus, and stapes; the foot of the stapes blocks up the fenestra ovalis upon the inner wall of the tympanum. 11. The promontory. 12. The fenestra rotunda; the dark open- ing above the ossicula leads into the mastoid cells. 13. The Eustachian tube; the little canal upon this tube contains the tensor tympani muscle in its passage to the tympanum. 14. The vestibule. 15. The three semicircular canals—horizontal, perpendicular, and oblique. 16. The ampuUce upon the perpendicular and hori- zontal canals. 17. The cochlea. 18. A depression between the convexities of the two tubuli which communicate with the tympanum and vestibule: the one is the scala tympani, terminating at 12, the other is the scala vestibuli. cochleariforme. This part of the tube is small in the pre- pared bone, and much smaller in the recent bone before its membranous lining is removed. In the upper wall is a depression which is occupied by the head of the malleus and the short leg of the incus. This wall is perforated by several foramina, for the transmission of vessels to the dura mater. The ossicula auditus, or small bones of the ear, Fig. 42, are the malleus, incus, orbiculare, and stapes. 11*

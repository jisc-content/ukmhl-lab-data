418 OF THE ABDOMEN. The Under or Abdominal Side op the Diaphragm.â€”1, 2, 3. The greater muscle; the figure 1 rests upon the central leaflet of the tendinous centre; the number 2 on the left or smallest leaflet; and number 3 on the right leaflet. 4. The thin fasciculus which arises from the ensiform cartilage; a small triangular space is left on either side of this fasciculus, which is closed only by the serous membranes of the abdomen and chest. 5. The ligamentum arcuatum externum of the left side. 6. The ligamentum arcuatum internum. 7. A small arched opening occasionally found, through which the lesser splanchnic nerve passes. 8. The right or larger tendon of the lesser muscle; a muscular fasciculus from this tendon curves to the left side of the greater muscle between the oesophageal and aortic openings. 9. The fourth lumbar vertebra. 10. The left or shorter tendon of the lesser mus- cle. 11. The aortic opening occupied by the aorta, which is cut short off. 12. A portion of the oesophagus issuing through the oesophageal opening. 13. The opening for the inferior vena cava, in the tendinous centre of the diaphragm. 14. The psoas magnus muscle passing beneath the ligamentum arcuatum internum; it has been removed on the opposite side to show the arch more distinctly. 15. The quadratus lumborum passing beneath the ligamentum arcuatum externum; this muscle has also been removed on the left side. The fibres converge from this extended origin, and are in- serted into the anterior and lateral borders of the central tendon. The lesser muscle arises, tendinous, on the right side from the bodies of the upper three or four lumbar vertebra, and from their intervertebral substance ; and on the left side from the

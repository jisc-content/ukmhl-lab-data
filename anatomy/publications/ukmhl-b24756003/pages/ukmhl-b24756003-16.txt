viii PREFACE. most convenient and advantageous to students, whose time for studying practical anatomy is limited, and who, not un- frequently, are compelled to confine their dissections to one or two bodies during the session. The body is supposed to be divided into Jive parts^ and apportioned to as many persons; one of whom has the head and neck, two have, each an uj^per extremity separately, and the thorax in common; two have, each a lower extremi{y, including the ahdominal and pelvic viscera between them. It is expected that all will partici- pate in the examination of the parts contained in the three great splanchnic cavities, as they cannot be divided. Mere arbitrary rules for exposing the parts in any region have been, in general, avoided; the position and the relations of each organ or part have indicated the method that has been adopted for dissecting it. Every part in a region has been noticed as it would naturally be met with when the student was desirous of studying everything contained in that region. 1 have found, that when the attention of a student was directed to the relations of a part as well as to the part itself, the recollection of the one usually aided him in the recollection of the other; that it was merely necessary for him to appropriate more time to the study of the parts of that region. In aiming to make the book as useful as possible, viewing the student as a candidate for the practice of medicine and surgery, I have not hesitated to discriminate, to some ex- tent, betAveen different regions and organs in a practical point of view; hence, I have dwelt longer on some parts than on others, being governed in this respect partly by what I con- ceived to be the relative value and importance of the know- ledge of any part or organ to the student, and partly by the dif&culty which I have observed students in the dissecting- room, especially beginners, to have in dissecting and under- standing them. Thus, I have devoted a large share of time and space to the organs contained in the three great splanch-

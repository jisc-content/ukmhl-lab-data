It surrounds the lower orifice of the rectum; is narrow and somewhat pointed before and behind this opening, but an inch or more broad on each side of it. It presents an upper and a lower border. The lower one is separated from the skin by a very thin layer of areolar tissue, while the upper one is blended with the fibres of the levator ani. The outer surface is in apposition with the adi- pose tissue contained in the ischio-rectal fossa. It closes the anus and at the same time slightly elevates it; it also assists the transversi perinei in fixing the perineal centre.

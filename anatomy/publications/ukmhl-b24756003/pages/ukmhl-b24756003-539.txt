A synovial membrane An Anterior View of the Ligaments connecting the Atlas, the Axis, and THE Occipital Bone. A Transverse Section has been carrieb through the Base op the Skull, dividing the Basilar Process of the Occii-ital Bone AND the Petrous portions op the Temporal Bones.—1. The anterior round occipito-atlantal ligament. 2. The anterior broad oecipito-atlantal ligament. 3. The commencement of the anterior common ligament. 4. The anterior atlanto-axoid ligament, which is continuous inferiorly with the commencement of the anterior common ligament. 5. One of the atlanto-axoid capsular ligaments; the one on the opposite side has been removed, to show the approximated surfaces of the articular processes (6). 7. One of the occipito-atlantal capsular ligaments. The most exter- nal of these fibres constitute the lateral occipito-atlantal ligament. lines the inner surface of each ligament, and covers the articular cartilage inclosed by the ligament. The Posterior Ligaments op the Occipito-atloid, and Atlanto-axoid Arti- culations.—1. The atlas. 2. The axis. 3. The anterior ligament of the occipito- atlantal articulation. 4, 4. The capsular and lateral ligaments of this articulation. 5. The posterior ligament of the utlnnto-axoid articulation. 6, 6. Its capsular ligaments. 7. The first of the ligamonta subflava, passing between the axis and tho third cervical vertebra. 8, 8. Tho capsular ligaments of those vertebras. Fig. 227. Fig. 228.

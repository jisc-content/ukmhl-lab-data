The Interosseous Ligament, Fig. 265 (i i), is placed in a canal formed by a transverse groove on the under surface of the astragalus, and a corresponding one on the upper sur- face of the os calcis. It is a short, but very strong ligament, forming the principal ligamentous connection between these bones. Its fibres have more or less adipose substance inter- mixed with them. To obtain a good view of this ligament, a vertical section of the astragalus and os calcis should be made, so as to divide the ligament in an antero-posterior di- rection. These bones articulate with each other by mutual reception; the astragalus presents two articular surfaces; a concave one placed behind the groove, and a convex one anterior to the groove, while the os calcis presents two cor- responding articular facets. The articulation, posterior to the groove, has a distinct synovial capsule, Fig. 265 (i o), while the synovial capsule (12) of the articulation in front of the

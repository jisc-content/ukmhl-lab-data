71 THE CEREBELLUM. The inferior surface, Fig. 15, of eacli hemisphere presents five lobes separated by sulci. t , i u i +-u The inferior posterior hhe is situated immediately below the superior posterior, and separated from its fellow by the pos- terior notch. . The digastric hhe is larger, and is seen near the anterior and external border of the hemisphere. This lobe is con- nected to its fellow on the opposite side by transverse lamelL», which extend through the pyramid across the valley. Its outer extremity is broad, and divided into two parts. The gracilis lobe is situated between the two preceding. It has a transverse direction. Fia;. 15. A View of the Inferiou Surface of the Cerebelluji and a portion op the Medulla Oblongata.—1,1.

Hhe flocculus, or pncumogastric lobe, Fig. 15 (5), is attached to the hemisphere by a pedicle. It is situated anteriorly by the side of the valley, and just behind the crus cerebelli, close to the eighth nerve. Its surface is divided into small lamellae. The two flocculi, as before mentioned, are con- nected to each other by the posterior medullary velum. The amygdaloid, or tonsillitic lobes, were seen in the dissec- tion of the fourth ventricle. These two lobes form the lateral boundaries of the valley, and are connected to each other by the uvula. The sitjyerior vermiform process extends from th^ posterior

396 OF THE ABDOMEN. A part of the transverse colon is placed between tlie two ascending layers of tlie omentum majus, and it consequently has, like tlie stomach, two non-peritoneal surfaces. The peri- toneum on the cascum and colon presents numerous small pouches filled with fat. The length of these is diminished when the bowel is inflated. They are called appendices epiploicce. The longitudinal muscular fibres in the caecum and colon are collected into three hands, which correspond to the smooth surfaces between the pouches. They commence at the ap- pendix vermiformis cseci, and terminate at the rectum. The saCTculated form of the large intestine is caused by the rela- tive shortness of these bands. The circular fibres are most numerous in the ridges which project into the intestine be- tween the sacculi. The cellular coat requires no Fig. 167.

It separates the mucous from the muscular coat in the same manner as the corresponding layer does in the small intestine. The mucous coat has a pale appearance. It has no folds corresponding to the valvulte conniventes in the small in- testine. The projections be- tween the sacculi are formed of all the layers except the longitudinal fibres of the muscular coat. It has very few if any villi. It has alveoli similar to those observed in the stomach. It is every- where thickly studded with the orifices of follicles or tu- buli, which resemble those of Lieberkiihn in the small intestine. There are also found scattered over its sur- face, cr7jp)ts or follicles, a large size. These consist of small pouches with contract- ed orifices, opening on the mucous surface. They are

DISSECTION OF THE DEEP VESSELS AND NERVES. 411 outwards on the bodies of tlie vertebras. The upper two on each side go behind the cms of the diaphragm and the lower two or three behind the psoas magnus. Each divides into an abdominal and a dorsal branch. The latter, after sending a branch through the intervertebral foramen to the spinal canal, goes to the muscles and integument of the back. The former pass behind the quadratus lumborum, and supply branches to the posterior abdominal parietes. They anastomose with the intercostal, the internal circumflex ilii, and the ilio-lumbar arteries. These arteries may be dissected on one side, leaving the psoas magnns and the nerves to be examined on the other; or they may all be dissected at the same time. The middle sacral artery^ Fig. 159 (12), arises from the posterior part of the aorta, just above its bifurcation. It is Fig. 177. A View op the Urinary Organs in Situ.—1, ].

THE LOWER EXTEEMITY. 546 Fig. 237. liteal fossa of the femur, tlie posterior part of the knee-ioint and the pophteus muscle, or the aponeurosis which covers it' IJae pophteal region generally contains a considerable quantity ot areolar tissue and adipose substance, which ren- ders the dissection of its contents difficult, requiring time and patience to do it in a proper manner. The vessels consist of the popliteal artery and its branches, and of the accompanying veins. The nerves are the internal and external popliteal, and their branches. The Popliteal Yein, Fig. 240 (i), is placed between the artery and the inte- gument, so that it will be found in the dissection before the artery. The pos- terior or external saphenous vein', Fig. 240 (7), will also be observed entering the popliteal space above the joint, and usually sending off a branch which passes upwards, and anastomoses with the inferior perforating branch. The large nerves are more superficial, and are situated, except at the lower part of the popliteal space, nearer to its outer border than the artery or vein, and consequently should be looked for in the dissection before those vessels. The Internal Popliteal Nerve, Fig. 237 (i, 2), is the largest of the two divi- sions of the great sciatic, of which it seems to be a continuation; it is nearly twice the size of the external popliteal nerve. The biceps flexor muscle partly covers it above the knee-joint. It gra- dually approaches the artery, and finally crosses it and the vein. It takes the name of posterior tibial nerve in the leg. It gives off several branches, some of which are muscular, one cutaneous, and others articular. The muscular branches arise from it behind the joint, and A View op the Inter- nal Popliteal and Pos- terior Tibial Nerves in THE Ham and the back OP THE Leg.â€”1, 2, indi- cate the course of them; the upper part of the ex- ternal popliteal nerve is seen to the right.

The Lachrymal Sac occupies a fossa formed by the su- perior maxilla and os unguis in the inner and anterior part o± the orbit. It is continuous with the upper extremity of the ductus ad nasum, from which it is separated only by a constriction or fold of the mucous membrane. It is separated trom the anterior extremity of the middle meatus of the nose by the lachrymal bone. The Ductus ad Nasum, Fig. 7,/, leads from the lachrymal sac into the anterior extremity of the inferior meatus of the Fig. 7. Lachrymal Apparatus and Nasal Duct.—a, b, c.

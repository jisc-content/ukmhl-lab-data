THE LOWEE EXTREMITY. 489 The vessels and ne^'ves of the uterus and ovaries are no- ticed in the dissection of the vessels and nerves of the pelvic cavity. CHAPTER II. OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY. Sect. I.â€”Dissection of the Anterior Part of the Thigh. The position and connections of the parts concerned in femoral or crural hernia are such that the examination of them naturally precedes the general dissection of the anterior part of the thigh; hence it will be unnecessaiy to describe again the parts which have been examined specially as well as in their relations to femoral hernia. Anatomy of Femoral Hernia. In femoral or crural hernia the bowel protrudes under Poupart's ligament, near its insertion into the spine and crest of the pubic bone. The parts which are involved in this form of hernia are situated below, behind, and above Pou- part's ligament. Those below it are the skin, the superficial fascia including the vessels, nerves, and lymphatics which are found in it, the fascia lata and the infuudibuliform sheath of the femoral artery and vein; behind it are found the psoas magnus and iliacus internus muscles, the anterior crural nerve, the external iliac artery and vein, the infundibuliform sheath, and the femoral ring; above it and in the abdomen are the peritoneum, the sub-peritoneal areolar tissue, and the fasciae transversalis and iliaca. The parts in the thigh below Poupart's ligament can be exposed without opening the cavity of the abdomen; but the dissection of the parts placed behind and above it, require this cavity to be opened. The integument must be dissected off' from the anterior portion of the upper third of the thigh. This may be done by making an incision through the skin, from the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium, directly downwards to the middle third of the thigh, and then extending it transversely across to the inner side of

DISSECTION OF THE ARM. 249 fig. 106. Ii 4 establishes a direct commiTnication between the superficial and deep- seated veins. It has no valves; and hence, in varicose aneurism, or aneu- rismal varix, it allows the blood to pass readily from one set of veins to the other. The Superficial Lymphatics accompany the veins, especially the basilic. A single lymphatic gland is placed in front of the inner con- dyle. The lymphatics terminate in the axillary glands. . The Deep Fascia, or Brachial Aponeurosis, Fig. 106, lies directly beneath the superficial fascia. It consists of fibres, running, some in a ' longitudinal, some in a spiral, and others in a circular direction. It increases in thickness and strength from above downwards. Above, it is connected to the pectoral, deltoid, infra-spinous, and axillary fascise, also to the tendons of several of the mus- cles about the shoulder; some of which are capable of rendering it more or less tense when they con- tract. It is connected to the humerus by two processes, or septa, an exter- nal and an internal. The external is attached to the outer part of the humerus, extending from the outside of the deltoid ridge to the external condyle, separating the triceps extensor from the brachialis anticus muscle, and, at the same time, giving origin to many fibres of these muscles, especially at the ™f' ^"^^"^ BnAcniALis in its whole extent.—1.

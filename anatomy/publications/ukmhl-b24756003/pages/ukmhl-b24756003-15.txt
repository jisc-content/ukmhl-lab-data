It has been my constant aim to instil in the dissecting-room a feeling of self-reliance and self-dependence; to make the student feel that when he had exposed a part, as a muscle, for example, he could see and learn its relations to surrounding parts just as well with- out as with being told them; that he could see with his own eyes whether a muscle lies on the outer or inner side of a particular artery, and whether it must be divided or not in cutting down upon the latter for the purpose of applying a ligature to it, or whether it may serve as a guide for finding the vessel, and, if so, in what way. In following out this plan, I have, whenever the opportunity offered, suggested what deserved his special attention, believing that a simple suggestion would often be of more value to him than a whole page occupied in describing what a mere hint^would prompt him to ascertain or learn without assistance. Whenever I have been able, in the dissecting-room, to make a student feel a consciousness of his own ability to become a good practical anatomist^ I have almost invariably had the grati- fication of witnessing his entire success. For the truth of this remark, I can appeal to hundreds of gentlemen who are at this time engaged in the active duties of professional life in different portions of the United States. In the dissecting-room, more than in almost any other place, the student should be encouraged to cultivate a habit of self-interrogation; to ask himself the use of everything he dissects, and in what way a knowledge of it can be itiade available to him, either in understanding the other branches of medical science or in his future practice. To incite in his mind such a spirit of self-inquiry has been my constant en- deavor throughout the work. In the division of a subject, I have followed the plan which I have found, after a trial of many years, to bo thb

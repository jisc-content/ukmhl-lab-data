The adductor of the little finger^ Fig. 120 (3), arises from the radial side of the fifth metacarpal bone, and is inserted into the first phalanx of the little finger. The arrangement of the four dorsal interosseous muscles is quite different. Two of them are abductors, while the other two act on the middle finger. Each one arises by two heads. The abductor of the forefinger^ Fig. 121 (1), arises from the first and second metacarpal bones, and is inserted into the base of the first phalanx of the index finger. Fig. 120. Fig. 121.

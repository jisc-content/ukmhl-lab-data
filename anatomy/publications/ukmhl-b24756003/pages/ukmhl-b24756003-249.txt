DISSECTION OF THE SHOULDER, 241 verts it into a foramen. The ligament is named the coracoid or supra-scapular ligament. The two following muscles are situated on the dorsum of the scapula, below the spine: the infra-spinatus, and teres minor. Besides the skin and subcutaneous fascia, they are covered with the mfra-spinous fascia, or aponeurosis. This fascia is attached to the margins of the infra-spinata fossa, and, at the posterior border of the deltoid, divides into two layers, one of which is continuous with the deltoid fascia over that muscle, while the other passes beneath it, and becomes continuous with the brachial fascia. The Infra-Spinatus Muscle, Fig. 101 (5, 13), arises from nearly the whole of the infra-spinata fossa, and posteriorly Fig. 101. 7 A Posterior View op'the Muscles op the Shoulder which strengthen the Articulation.â€”1.

The fibres which arise from the spine of the scapula overlap those below, and they all converge to form a short tendon, which is inserted into the great tuberosity of the humerus, just below the insertion of the supra-spinatus, with which it is connected. Its tendon is blended with the capsular ligament. It can assist the deltoid in raising the arm, and drawing it backwards; or it can rotate the humerus outwards; it may also withdraw the capsular ligament from the joint, or, when the arm is raised, depress the head of the humerus. 21

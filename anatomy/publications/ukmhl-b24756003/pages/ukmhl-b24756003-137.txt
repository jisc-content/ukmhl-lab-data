A HIGHLY MAGNIFIED VIEW OF THE EXTERNAL FACE OF THE BONY LABYRINTH OP THE Left Side, opened so as to expose the Vestibule and its contents, &c.â€”The difference of color in the shades of this figure is intended to assist in distinguishing the external from the internal faces of the lahyrinth, and also the cavities supposed to be occupied by the liquor of Cotunnius. 1. The ampulla of the superior semi- circular canal. 2. The ampulla of the external canal. 3. The ampulla of the inferior canal. 4. The superior membranous semicircular canal. 5. External membranous canal. 6. The inferior membranous canal. 7. The spaces between the bony and membranous semicircular canals, thought to be occupied by the liquor Cotunnii. 8. The common tube formed by the union of the superior and inferior membranous canals. 9. The place where the external semicircular canal opens into the sacculus ellipticus of the vestibule. 10. The sacculus ellipticus containing the otoconia of Breschet, seen at 11. 12, Sacculus sphericus, containing also some otoconia, as soon at 13. 14, 15,16,17, 18. The expansions of the auditory nerve to the membranous canals and the sacculus ellipticus, and also to the sphericus. 19. The turns of the lamina spiralis. 20. The scala tympani. 21.

One of these scala) opens into the tym- panum, and the other into the vestibule, hence they are named the iympmiic and the vestilndar scalas.

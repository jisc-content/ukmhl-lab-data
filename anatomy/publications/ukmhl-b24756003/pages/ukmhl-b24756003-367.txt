When these branches enter the superficial fascia, they divide into anterior and posterior filaments, to anastomose with each other, and also with the posterior spinal nerves. The last dorsal nerve is relatively very large. Its lateral cutaneous branch, after perforating the internal and'external oblique muscles, descends to the crest of the ilium, where it

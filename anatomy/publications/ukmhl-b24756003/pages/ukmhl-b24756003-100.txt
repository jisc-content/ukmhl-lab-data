92 DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. The Levator Palpebr^ Muscle, Fig. 23 (4), arises from J,. 20 of tlie orbit in front of ■ the optic foramen. It widens as it extends forwards, and is imerted bj a broad tendon into the upper margin of the superior tarsal cartilage. The Superior Oblique Muscle, Fig. 23 (5), arises from the inner part of the op- tic foramen, passes along the inner and upper part of the orbit to the cartilaginous pul- ley, through which its tendon passes to be reflected down- wards, backwards, and out- wards to the ball of the eye. The reflected portion of this muscle must be left for the present. The Fourth Nerve, or the Pathetic, Fig. 20 (4), enters the orbit above, and on the inner side of the frontal, which it leaves in the posterior part of the orbit, passing inwards to the superior oblique muscle, which it penetrates by several filaments on the orbital side. The Lachrymal Nerve, Fig. 37 (10), enters the orbit a little to the outside of, and below the frontal nerve, and above the muscles, runs along the upper border of the external rectus to the lachrymal gland, to which it sends filaments; after perforating or passing beneath the gland, it divides into palpebral branches. One of these anastomoses with a branch of the facial, one goes to the integument upon the forehead, and one or two filaments pass downwards to join the second division of the fifth pair. These parts may now be divided in the anterior portion of the orbit, and reflected back. As the levator palpebras is turned back, a branch of the third nerve, or motor oculi, will be seen entering it on its under surface. The nerves above described should all be preserved for the purpose of tracing them through the cavernous sinus. The Nerves in the Orbit above the Muscles, brought into View by re- moving the roof of the Orbit and THE Periosteum.—1. Fifth nerve. 2. Ophthalmic branch of same nerve. 3. Third nerve. 4. Fourth nerve. 5. Optic nerve. 6. Sixth nerve, a. Internal ca- rotid artery.

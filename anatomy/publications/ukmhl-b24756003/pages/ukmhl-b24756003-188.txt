DISSECTION OF THE NECK. 180 them pass transversely across it, It acts on the sides and The Anatomy op the sinn of the neck, showing the nerves of the Tongue. ■—1. A fragment of the temporal bone containing the meatus auditorius externiis, mastoid, and styloid processes. 2. The stylo-hyoid muscle. 3. The stylo-glossus. 4. The stylo-pharyngeus. 5. The tongue. 6. The hyo-glossus muscle ; its two por- tions. 7. The genio-hyo-glossus muscle. 8. The genio-hyoideus; they both arise from the inner surface of the symphysis of the lower jaw. 9. The sterno-hyoid muscle. 10. The sterno-thyroid. 11. The thyro-hyoid, upon which the thyro- hyoidean branch of the hypoglossal nerve is seen ramifying. 12. The omo-hyoid crossing the common carotid artery (13), and internal jugular vein (14). 15. The external carotid giving oiF its branches. 16. The internal carotid. 17. The gusta- tory nerve giving off a branch to the submaxillary ganglion (18), and communi- cating a little further on with the hypoglossal nerve. 19. The submaxillary, or Wharton's duct, passing forwards to the sublingual gland. 20. The glosso-pharyn- geal nerve, passing in behind the hyo-glossus muscle. 21. The hypoglossal nerve curving around the occipital artery. 22. The descendens noni nerve, forming a loop with (23) the communicans noni, which is seen to be arising by filaments from the upper cervical nerves. 24. The pneumogastric nerve, emerging from between the internal jugular vein and common carotid artery, and entering the chest. 25. The facial nerve, emerging from the stylo-mastoid foramen, and crossing the exter- nal carotid artery. The Hyo-Glossus, Fig. 70 (e), is a thin square muscle, which arises from the body and great cornu of the hyoid bone; its fibres pass upwards and are inserted into the tongue, tongue. Fig. 70.

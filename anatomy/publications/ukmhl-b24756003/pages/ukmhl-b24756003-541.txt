DISSECTION OF ARTICULATIONS OF VERTEBRA. 533 outwards. They have been called moderator or check liga- ments, from their regulating the rotatory motion of the head on the axis. What is called the middle ligament consists of a few ligamentous fibres that pass from the summit of the odon- toid process to the anterior border of the occipital foramen. The atlas and axis are connected together by five liga- ments. The Anterior, Fig. 227 (4), and Posterior, Fig. 228 (e), Atlanto-axoid Ligaments are placed between the ante- rior and posterior arches of the atlas and the corresponding portions of the axis. The anterior is attached below, to the base of the odontoid process, and on each side of it, to the body of the axis, where it is continuous with the anterior common ligament. The posterior ligament corresponds to the ligamenta sub-flava; below it is attached to the upper borders of the laminae of the axis. Fig. 230. A Posterior View op the LrGAiiEHTS connecting the Atlas, the Axis, and THE Occipital Bone. The Posterior part op the Occipital Bone has been SAWN AWAY, AND THE POSTERIOR ArCHES OP THE AtLAS AND AxiS REMOVED. 1. The superior part of the occipito-axoid ligament, which has been cut away in order to shoxy the ligaments beneath. 2. The transverse ligament of the atlas. 3.4. The ascending and descending slips of the transverse ligament, which have obtained for It the title of cruciform ligament. 5. One of the odontoid ligaments; the other ligament IS seen on the opposite side. 6. One of the occipito-atlantal capsular li<^a- Dients. 7. One of the atlanto-axoid capsular ligaments. Â° There are two Capsular Ligaments, Fig. 230 (7), one for the oblique processes on each side. Each is composed of straight and oblique fibres, and is thicker anteriorly than at any other part. They are of sufficient length to admit of rotatory, as well as several other movements, to the head. They are lined by synovial membranes, which 45*

THE FACE. 31 The Parotid and Masseteric regions should be examined first, and at the same time. Fig. 2. A View of the Veins of the Head and Neck.â€”a. Facial vein. h. Temporal vein. c.

As the integument is raised and reflected forwards, the Platysma Myoides, Fig. 61 (i 4), will be found traversing the anterior part of these regions. Its fibres are generally pale, and are situated immediately beneath the skin, in which they terminate. Some fasciculi are directed towards the angle of the mouth; they form the risorius, or laughing muscle, of Santo rini. The Parotid Fascia is quite thick and dense, forms a sheath for the parotid gland, and sends numerous prolonga- tions into it. It is continuous below with the cervical, and in front with the masseteric fascia. The density of this fascia renders inflammation of the parotid gland painful, and retards the approach of pus, when formed in the gland, to the external surface.

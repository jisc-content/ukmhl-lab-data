392 OF THE ABDOMEN. Tj-ie Small Intestine. The small intestine is divided into three portions: the duo- denum, the jejunum, and the ileum. This division is wholly arbitrary, and practically is of little value. The small in- testme is about twenty feet in length. It diminishes in size, and m the thickness of its coats, from its commencement to its_termination. Its structure is similar to that of the stomach, being composed of a serous, a muscular, a cellular, and a mucous coat. The Seeous Coat consists principally of a single dupli- cature of the peritoneum, be- tween the laminas of which the vessels and nerves reach the intestine along its con- cave or attached border. The duodenal portion of the intestine is not entirely in- vested with a serous layer, as was observed in the ex- amination of it in situ. The MuscuLAE Layee, Fig. 164, is composed of a longitudinal and a circular set of fibres. The action of the bowel in propelling for- ward its contents, depends mainly on the circular fibres, which are much more numerous than the longitudinal. They do not, all of them at least, extend entirely around the circum- ference of the intestine. To obtain a good view of the longi- tudinal fibres, a section of the intestine should be inflated, and the peritoneum carefully dissected or peeled off. The}' will be found more numerous on the convex than on the con- cave border of the bowel. The Oellulae Layee is interposed between the mus- cular and mucous layers, between which it forms a bond of union, allows the latter to glide freely on the former, and furnishes a medium for the transmission and subdivision of the vessels and nerves supplied to the mucous membrane.

THE LOWER EXTREMITY. 532 The Lateral Occipito-atlantal Ligament Fic^ 228 (4), connects the transverse process of the occipital bone to the transverse process of the atlas. It is quite a thick, strong ligamentous cord. By its connection with a ligamentous tascicuius, which is attached to the petrous portion of the temporal bone, a fibrous canal is formed for the transmission of the large vessels and nerves at the base of the skull. The occipital bone is connected to the axis by four liga- ments; three of which are attached to the odontoid process and one to the body of the axis. ' Fig. 229.

The atlas, its posterior arch removed. 4. The axis, the posterior arch also removed. 5. The occipito-axoid ligament, ren- dered prominent at its middle by the projection of the odontoid process. 6. Lateral and capsular ligaments of the occipito-atlantal articulation. 1. Capsular ligament between the articulating processes of the atlas and axis. The Occipito-axoid Ligament, or Apparatus Liga- MENTOSUS Colli, Fig. 229 (5), is placed beneath the dura mater, and extends from the lower part of the basilar fossa of the occipital bone downwards to the body of the axis, where the central part of it is continuous with the posterior common spinal ligament. The lower part of this ligament may be divided into three fasciculi or bands, two of which are situated laterally, and are continued down to the third or fourth cervical vertebrce. The Odontoid or Moderator Ligaments connect the odontoid process with the sides of the occipital foramen. They consist of thick, round fibrous cords, one on each side, which have an oblique direction from below upwards and

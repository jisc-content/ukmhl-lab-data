267 DISSECTION OF THE FOEEARM. Fig. 115. round fasciculus from the coronoid process of the ulna. It ends in a tendon which passes beneath the annular ligament, and continues to the last phalangeal bone of the thumb, into which it is inserted. It flexes the last phalanx of the thumb. The Pronatok Quadratus, Fig. 114 (e), and 115 (9), is a short, square muscle, placed beneath the preceding muscles. It ai-ises from the inner part of the lower fifth of the ulna; its fibres pass transversely, or nearly so, across the interosseous space, and are inserted into the lower part of the radius, near its outer border. It rotates the radius in- wards, and thus pronates the hand. The Anterior Interosseous Ar- tery, Fig. 112 (19), may now be exam- ined, and also its accompanying nerve. They usually rest on the interosseous ligament near the median line. The artery passes through the ligament near the pronator quadratus to the dorsum of the carpus, where it divides into several small branches. Occasionally it gives off quite a large branch, which accompanies the median nerve down the forearm. The Anterior Interosseous Nerve, a View op the prona- Fig. 108 (13), terminates in a filament tors op the Forearm 1. to the pronator quadratus and one to ar7"6apsui!rS.eni the carpal articulations.

AETERIES OP THE DUEA MATER. The arteries of the dura mater are derived from several sources. The Anterior Meningeal are branches of the ethmoidal, and enter the cavity of the cranium through the ethmoidal foramina. The Middle Meningeal is the largest of all the arteries of the dura mater. It passes through the foramen spinosum of the great wing of the sphenoid bone. Its terminal branches were seen when the calvaria was removed. It ramifies between the bone and the dura mater, presenting an arbores- cent appearance. The grooves or furrows in the bone, which are occupied by the branches of this artery, vary very much in depth. In trephining, the relations of the middle menin- geal artery to the osseous walls of the cranium are important to be recollected. The situation of the principal trunk is indicated externally by a line extending from near the centre of the zygoma directly upwards. The Posterior Meningeal Artery is a branch of the vertebral. It arises nearly opposite the foramen magnum. Besides these, the dura mater gets a branch from the inter- nal maxillary, through the foramea ovale, which is sometimes called the meningea. parva; another branch from the ascend- ing pharyngeal, through the foramen lacerum medius; one from the internal carotid; and a fourth from the occipital, through the foramen lacerum posterius. The nerves of the dura mater are derived, principally from the fifth pair.

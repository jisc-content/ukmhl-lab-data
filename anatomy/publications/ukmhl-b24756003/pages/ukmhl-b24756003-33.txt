THE PRACTICAL AJ^ATOMIST. GENERAL REMARKS. Peehaps no part of the course of study wliich the raedical student is required to pursue is approached with a stronger feeling of reluctance than that of practical anatomy. Nor will the neglect of any part of his course cause him more regret when actively engaged in the duties of his profession. Although it must be admitted that there are some things connected with dissecting which are unpleasant, yet, when the value of the knowledge which can be acquired only in the dissecting-room is considered, these things should not be allowed to have the slightest influence on the conduct of the student. It is only in the dissecting-room that he can have the opportunity of seeing the various organs of the body before their relations to each other have been disturbed, or of cutting and separating the different tissues of which they are composed, and by which they are connected together. However clearly they may be presented and accurately described in the lecture-room, it is impossible that he should obtain so correct an idea of them as when he can take them in his own hands and examine them for himself. There is, perhaps, just reason to apprehend that, for the want of having had experience in the dissecting-room, many members of our profession are deterred from making post- mortem examinations, which would be of great value to themselves, as well as to medical science.

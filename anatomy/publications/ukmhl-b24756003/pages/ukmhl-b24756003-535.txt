DISSECTION OF AETICULATIONS OF VERTEBRA, 527 Fig. 223. vertebral substance, which also assists iu forming the inter vertebral foramina. If a section of the interverte- bral substance be made, it will be found to consist. Fig. 224 (3), principally of a soft pulpy sub- stance in the centre, and of thin layers or laminae of fibro-car- tilage externally. The general arrangement of the laminae are concentric, one being placed within another; some of them interlace with each other. They are connected together by fibres, which extend from one lamina to another.

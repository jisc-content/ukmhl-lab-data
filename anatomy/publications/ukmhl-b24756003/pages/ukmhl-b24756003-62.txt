On the inner surface of the calvaria will be observed a groove extending along the median line; this corresponds to the superior longitudinal sinus. On each side axefurroius which present in their arrangement an arborescent appear- ance; these are occupied by branches of the middle meningeal artery. Small depressions on either side of the median line are commonly seen; these are for the lodgement of the exter- nal glands of Pacchioni. On the external surface of the dura mater, the situation of the superior longitudinal sinus, the ramifications of the middle meningeal artery, and the external glands of Pacchioni, will be noticed. The dura mater is usually studded with points of blood caused by the rupture of vessels in the removal of the calvaria.

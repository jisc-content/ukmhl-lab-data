DISSECTION OF THE AEM. 255 tlie joint. In case of fracture of the coronoid process, it may dis- the Fig. 109. draw the fragment upwards. When the tendons of this muscle and the_ biceps are sected, and reflected downwards, the anterior part ot elbow-joint is exposed, being cov- ered only by a few ligamentous fibres. On the outside of the brachialis anticus, and applied closely to it, is the supinator longus muscle. When these mus- cles°are separated, the musculo- spiral nerve and the superior pro- funda artery will be found deeply embedded between them. The arm may now be turned over for the purpose of dissecting the back of it. The skin and su- perficial fascia may be removed by dissecting from either the in- ner or outer side. After examin- ing the brachial aponeurosis, it is to be removed by dissecting in the direction of the fibres of the triceps extensor muscle, having made that muscle tense by flex- ing the forearm on the arm and fixing the scapula. The Triceps Extensoe, Fig. 110 (lo, 14, 19), arises by three heads, one from the scapula, and two from the humerus. The first, or longest head, arises from the in- ferior costa of the scapula, occu- An Anterior ViKw OF THE Deep-seated Muscles op the Arm.—1. Clavicle. 2. Coracoid process of the scapula. 3.

TOPOGEAPHY OF THE MOUTH. 145 The mucous membrane forms a fold on tlie inner side of each lip, which is called frcenum labii. In the posterior division of the buccal cavity, the mucous membrane and the papillas of the tongue are the principal things now to be examined. The portion covering the hard palate is similar to that of the gums. It is rough and uneven. Between it and the bone ramify vessels and nerves. It covers over and conceals the anterior and posterior palatine fora- mina. Between the alveolar processes of the lower jaw and the free border of the tongue it is thin, and loosely connected to the subjacent tissues. In the median line and on the un- der surface of the tongue it presents a fold, called the frcenum lingucB. This is so large and unyielding in some cases, that it interferes with the movements of the tongue. The diffi- culty is removed by dividing its free border. Just behind the incisor teeth, Fig. 53 (3), the mucous membrane is perforated Fig. 53. A View op the Lower Jaw, with the Tongue drawn upwards, so as to SHOW ITS under surface in situ.â€”1, 2.

The upper surface of the tongue is studded with papilJte, Fig. 54, which render it quite rough. There are two kinds of tlicsc papillte. One set is perforated, and the other IS not. The former are.situated near the base of the 13

THE UPPER EXTREMITY. 260 Fig. 111. a small head, from the coronoid process of the ulua. The median nerve passes between these two origins. Its fibres pass obliquely downwards and outwards, to be inserted into the outer part of the middle third of the radius. The upper part of this muscle is superficial and prominent, while the lower part is deep-seated, having the radial artery and nerve in front of it. It rotates the radius inwards, and pronates the hand; it may also assist in flexing the forearm. The Flexor Carpi Radialis, Fig. Ill (s), arises from the internal condyle and fascia,, including the intermuscular sep- tum, in common with the preceding mus- cle. It forms a thick belly which becomes tendinous near the middle of the forearm, and continues so to its insertion into the base of the metacarpal bone of the index finger. The dissection of this muscle beneath and below the annular ligament with the lower part of the others which go to the hand, must be postponed until the palm of the hand is dissected. It flexes the hand on the forearm, and may assist in pronation and abduction of the same. The Palmaris Lokgus, Fig. Ill (e), is the next muscle to be dissected. Its origin is similar to that of the flexor carpi radialis. It forms a short belly, which ends in a long, slim tendon; this extends down the forearm to the annular ligament and palmar aponeurosis, into which it is inserted. It is sometimes SdPERnciAL Layer of the Muscles of the Forearm.â€”1. The lower part of the biceps, with its tendon. 2. A part of the brachialis anticus, seen beneath the biceps. 3.

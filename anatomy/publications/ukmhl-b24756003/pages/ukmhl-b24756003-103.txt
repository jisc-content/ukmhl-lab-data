APPENDAGES OF THE EYE WITHIN THE ORBIT. 95 . The ciliary arteries consist of three sets; the anterior, which are irreo-ular in their origin, perforate the sclerotic coat about two lines behmd the margin of the cornea; the long and Fig. 22, A View o*" the Thiud, FounTH, and Sixth Pairs of Nerves.â€”1. Ball of the eye, the rectus externus muscle being cut and hanging down from its origin. 2. The superior maxilla. 3. The third pair, or motor oculi, distributed to all the mus- cles of the eye except the superior oblique and external rectus. 4. The fourth pair, or pathetic, going to the superior oblique muscle. 5. One of the branches of the fifth. 6. The sixth pair, or motor externus, distributed to the external rectus mus- cle. 7. Spheno-palatine ganglion and branches. 8. Ciliary nerves from the len- ticular ganglion, the short root of which is seen to connect it with the third pair. short posterior arise & little distance behind the ball of the eye; the short, ten or fifteen in number, accompany the ciliary nerves; the two long ones perforate the sclerotic coat, one on either side of the optic nerve, and a little farther from it than the short. The muscular hrancJies are divided into the superior, which go to the superior rectus, oblique, and levator palpebree; and the inferior, which are distributed to the other recti muscles, and inferior oblique, and from which are derived some of the anterior ciliary arteries. The ethmoidal branches pass through the anterior and poste- rior ethmoidal foramina, and give branches to the dura mater and upper part of the nasal fossae. There are two palpebral branches; the superior, which enters the upper lid near the inner angle and anastomoses with the

Thej are most numerous along the concave border and near the pylorus, from which they are continued on to the small intestine. The circular fibres, Fig. 161 (?), pass round the circum- ference of the stomach from the cardiac to the pyloric orifice. They increase in number towards the pylorus. Around the pyloric orifice they are collected into a sphincter which is capable of closing that opening, so as to prevent the passage of the contents of the stomach into the duodenum during the time of its contraction. The oblique fibres, Fig. 161 (e), which are sometimes ab- sent or very indistinct, pass from one side of the stomach to the other around the great cul-de-sac to tlic left of the car- diac orifice. The Fibro-Cellulak Coat is placed between the muscu- 33*

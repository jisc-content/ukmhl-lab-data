121 OF THE EAR. from the auti-lielix by the fossa innominata. The lower pendulous part of the auricle is the lohe. It consists of a duplicature of the skin, with a small portion of adipose sub- stance. The helix and anti-helix unite behind to form the "processus caudaitcs, which is separated from the anti-tragus by a fis- Fig- 38. sure. The fissure of the tragus is situated on its anterior sur- face. The fissure of the helix is just above the tubercle to which is attached the attrahens aurem muscle. The Ligaments of the auricle are intrinsic and extrinsic. The former consist of ligamentous bands, intended to preserve the fibro-cartilage in its proper form, and to occupy the fis- sures. The latter consist of, a posterior^ which connects the <;oncha to the mastoid process; an anterior, which extends from the process of the helix to the zygomatic arch; and of a liga- ment, which connects the tragus to the same part. The Intrinsic Muscles, Fig. 39, of the auricle are the follow- ing. The helicis major is situated just above the tragus, on the anterior part of the helix. It consists of a narrow band of muscular fibres, tendinous at each extremity. The helicis minor occupies the helix where it projects into the concha. The anti-tragicus extends from the external surface of the anti-tragus to the processus caudatus. The tragicus lies vertically upon the external surface of the tragus. The transversus auriculce is situated on the cranial surface ot the auricle, extending from the concha to the helix, A View op the Left Ear in its NATUEAL state.â€”1,2.

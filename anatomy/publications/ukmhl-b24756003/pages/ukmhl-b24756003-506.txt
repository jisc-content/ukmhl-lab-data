After the remotal or the Lower Part of the External OBLiQtrE (with THE EXCEPTION OF A SMALL SLIP INCLUDING PoUPART's LiGAMENt), THE LoWER Portion of the Internal Oblique was raised, and thereby the Transver- salis Muscle and Fascia have been brought into view. The Femoral Artert and Vein are seen to a small extent, the Fascia Lata having been turned aside AND the Shbath OF THE BLOODVESSELS LAID OPEN.â€”1. External oblique muscle. 2. Internal oblique. 2'. Part of same turned up. 3. Transver- salis muscle. Upon tlie last-named muscle is seen a branch of the internal cir- cumflex ilii artery, with its companion veins ; and some ascending tendinous fibres are seen over the conjoined tendon of the two last-named muscles. 4.

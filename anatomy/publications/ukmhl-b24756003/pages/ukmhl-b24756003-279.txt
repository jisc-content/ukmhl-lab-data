271 DISSECTION OF THE FOREARM. Fig. 118. sum of the hand. The nerves are the posterior interosseous, and the cutaneous branches of the radial and ulnar on the lower part of the limb, which last were examined directly after the removal of the skin. The Supinator Brevis, Fig. 117 (s), is a short flat muscle, which arises from the external condyle, the ulna for a short distance below the lesser sigmoid cavity, and the external late- ral and orbicular ligaments. The fibres pass obliquely down- Avards and outwards, and are inserted into the radius between its cervix and the insertion of the pro- nator radii teres. To expose it, the supinator longus and the radio-carpal extensors must be divided a few inches below the elbow, and reflected upwards; the anconeus should also be dissected up. The Posterior Interosseous Ar- tery will be seen just below the supina- tor brevis. It descends to the wrist, Ijdng on the extensor muscles of the thumb and index finger. It gives off, in the upper part of its course, the poste- rior recurrent branch, which ascends be- neath the anconeus to anastomose with the superior profunda, and to send twigs to the elbow-joint. It supplies the mus- cles on the back of the forearm, and anastomoses on the dorsum of the wrist with branches from the radial, ulnar, and anterior interosseous arteries. The Posterior Interosseous Nerve, Fig. 118 (2), will be found passing through the supinator brevis, and then descending with the artery to near the middle of the forearm, where it dips down to the interosseous ligament, on which it continues to the 4 Wl hrnn^h nf f"^'"""V"'""''"""' ^- ""Hicral cutnneous branch!

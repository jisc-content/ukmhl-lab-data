The gall-bladder is supplied with blood by the cystic branch of the hepatic artery, Fig. 155, A, and with nerves by offshoots from the hepatic plexus. Dissection of the Panceeas. The pancreas, Fig. 173 (A, t, i\ is analogous to the salivary glands. It is from six to seven inches in length, and about three-fourths of an inch thick. Its breadth varies, its right extremity or the head being much broader than its left, which is called the tail. It has no proper fibrous capsule. In structure, it is similar to the parotid gland. It is composed of lobules, which are connected together by areolar tissue. ^^iQ pancreatic duct, Fig. 173 (e), extends the whole length Fig. 173. In this figure, which is altered from Tiedemann, the liver and ptomach are turned up, to show the duodenum, the pancreas, and the spleen. I. The under surface of the liver, g. Gail-bladdor. /.

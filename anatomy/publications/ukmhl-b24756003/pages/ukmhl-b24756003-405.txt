THE LARGE INTESTINE. 397 more numerous in the c£ecum and appendix vermiformis than elsewhere. These follicles may be inflamed without involv- ing other parts of the mucous membrane. The Appendix Vermiformis C^eci, Fig. 168 (5), has the same number of layers in its walls as the intestine. It opens into the cascum by an orifice about the size of a goose-quill. Sometimes a valvular fold of mucous membrane is found situated at this opening. Foreign bodies sometimes pass into it, and give rise to inflammation and ulceration of its coats. It is not known to have any function. The iLEO-CiECAL Yalve, Fig. 168 (3), or the valve of Baii- hin, is placed at the opening of the small into the large intes- tine. It consists of two folds of the mucous membrane, in- cluding areolar tissue and a layer of muscular fibres. The upper fold is sometimes called the ileo- colic valve. They project into the large intestine so as to form a slit between their free borders. This slit is placed transversely to the large intestine between the caecum and colon, and looks more into the latter than into the for- mer. A fold of mucous mem- brane is extended from each commissure for some distance on the inner surface of the intestine; they have been named the frcena of the valve. The lower fold, or ileo-ccecal valve, is somewhat larger than the ileo-colic. The shape of the aperture between the valves depend very much on the man- ner in which the peritoneum is reflected from the small to the large intestine. The mucous membrane of the ileum is continued to the free borders of the valves where that of the caecum and colon com- 34 Fig. 168.

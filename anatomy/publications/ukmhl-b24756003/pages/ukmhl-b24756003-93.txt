The arteries of the brain are derived from the internal carotid and the vertebral. Each internal carotid gives off at the base of the brain the anterior and middle cerebral, and the posterior communicating branch. The Anterior Cerebral Artery, Fig. 18 (i 3), is directed forwards and inwards to the fissure in front of the chiasm of the optic nerves. Just before it enters the fissure which separ- ates the anterior lobes of the cerebrum, it is connected to the anterior cerebral artery of the opposite side by a transverse anastomosing branch named the Anterior Communicating Ar- terij, Fig. 18 (i 4). This artery is usually not more than one or two lines in length. It completes the circle of Willis anteriorly. The anterior cerebral arteries then enter the fissure together, and pass upwards over the anterior extremity of the corpus callosum, and backwards on its superior sur- face to its posterior extremity. They are sometimes called the arteries of the corpus callosum^ where they rest on that body. The Middle Cerebral Artery, Fig. 18 (12), passes out- wards and backwards to the fissure of Sylvius, in which it gives off a great number of branches. To trace this artery in its course, the anterior lobe must be separated from the middle, so as to expose the whole of the fissure of Sylvius. The Posterior Communicating Artery, Fig. 18(9), passes 8

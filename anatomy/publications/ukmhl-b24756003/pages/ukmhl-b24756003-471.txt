DISSECTION OF THE PEEINEUM. 463 from the internal pudic, and sometimes from the preceding artery. It accompanies the transversus permei muscle to the Fig. 196. The Stuucttjres contained between the two Layers of the Deep Perineal Fascia.â€”1. The symphysis pubis. 2, 2. The rami of the pubes and ischia. 3, 3. The tuberosities of the ischia. 4. A triangular portion of the superficial fascia turned down, and shown to be continuous with the deep fascia (6, 6, 6). 5, 5. Two portions of the superficial perineal fascia reflected laterally, showing its connec- tion to the rami of the pubes and ischia. 6, 6, 6. The posterior layer of the deep perineal fascia, the anterior layer having been removed. 7. The membranous por- tion of the urethra cut across. 8. The superior fasciculus of the compressor urethrae muscle of one side. 9. The inferior layer of the compressor urethras. The two fasciculi (8) and (9) constitute Guthrie's muscle of one side. 10. The pubic por- tions of the corapressores urethras, or Wilson's muscles. 11. Cowper's glands, partly embraced by the inferior layer of the compressor urethras muscle. 12. The internal pudic artery passing anteriorly to the origin of the compressor urethrse. 13. The artery of the bulb. 14. The artery of the corpus cavernosum. 15. The arteria dorsalis penis. perineal centre, supplying the integument and muscles in front of the anus. The direction of this artery should be particularly observed. The nerves have the same course and distribution as the arteries, which they for the most part accompany. After removing the vessels and nerves just examined, and also the adipose substance and areolar tissue, of which a con- siderable quantity is usually found in this space, the follow- ing muscles will be exposed and should be carefully studied. A thin aponeurotic fascia^ which must not be confounded with the superficial perineal fascia, will be found investing

The outer wall, Fig. 50, is very uneven on account of the projection of the turbinated bones into the fossa. The INFERIOR TURBINATED BONE, Fig. 50 (7), is a separate piece. Its inferior free border is situated about half-way be- tween the superior maxilla and the septum nasi, and about four lines from the floor of the fossa. The distance between its central part, which is more prominent than the extremities, and the septum, is usually less than a fourth of an inch.

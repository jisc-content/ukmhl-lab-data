58 DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. The corpus callosum forms the roof of the two lateral ven- tricles, and has attached to its under surface, along the median Ime, the septum lucidum. The next thing to be done is to Fig. 10. A Vertical Section in the Median Plane, op the Cerebrum, Cerebellum, Pons, and Medulla Oblongata—the parts BEma all represented in their natural position.—a.

As the septum lucidum is attached to this body, the central part of it must be allowed to remain while the lateral portions of it are removed. This can be done by- making an incision through it on each side of the raphd, and about a line from the latter, from near the anterior to the pos-

DISSECTION OF THE LIVER. 399 The inferior joosierior surface, Fig. 169, is irregiilarly con- cave. It presents, usuallj, indentations for the right kid- ney, the colon, and the stomach. It has three fissures; two of which extend from the anterior to the posterior border. These last are named the right and left antero-posterior fissures. The left antero-posterior is sometimes called the longitudinal fissure, Fig. 169 (s). It indicates the line of division between t\\Q right and loft lobes of the liver on its under surface. The remaining one connects these two, and is called the trans- verse fissure, Fig. 169 (is). The antero-posterior fissures are separated anteriorly by the lohus quadyxdus. Fig. 169 (24), and posteriorly by the lohus Spigelii, Fig. 169 (25), while the lobes themselves are separated from each other by the trans- verse fissicre. The right antero-posterior fissure is interrupted just behind the transverse fissure, by a process extending from the lobus Spigelii tp the under surface of the right lobe; this process is called the lobus caudatus, Fig. 169 (se). The right antero-posterior fissure is occupied anteriorly by the gall-bladder, and posteriorly by the veiia cava. The left antero-posterior fissure contains, anteriorly, the remains Fig. 169.

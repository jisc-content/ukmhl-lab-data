DISSECTION OF THE GALL-BLADDER. The neck of the gall-bladder is doubled twice upon itself. This is caused principally by the manner m which the peri- toneum is attached to it. On the inside of the neck, l! ig. 17i Fig. 172. Shows thk Three Coats OF TUB Gall-Bladder se- parated FROM EACH OTHER. â€”1. The external or perito- neal coat. 2, 2. The cellular coat with its vessels injected. 3, 3. The mucous coat co- vered with wrinkles. 4, 4. Valves formed by this coat in the neck of the gall-blad- der. 5, 5. Orifices of the mucous follicles at this point. (4, 4), the coats project inwards so as to form two or three folds, which resemble valves. They do not, however, inter- fere with the passage of the bile in either direction. The cystic duct^ Fig. 173,/, is about an inch and a half in length. It unites with the hepatic duct to form the ductus choledochus communis. Its inner surface presents from ten to fifteen semilunar projections, which not unfrequently have a spiral form, resembling the thread of a screw. The hepatic duct^ Fig. 173,/, is formed by the union of two trunks in the transverse fissure of the liver. It is about an inch and a half in length. The ductus choledochus^ Fig. 173;/ is formed by the cystic and the hepatic ducts. It is about two inches and a half long. It is lined by a mucous membrane, which is continu- ous on the one hand with the mucous membrane of the duodenum, and on the other with that of the cystic duct and the gall-bladder, and that of the hepatic duct and its numerous subdivisions in the liver. The fibrous layer of these ducts is regarded by some as being composed of the

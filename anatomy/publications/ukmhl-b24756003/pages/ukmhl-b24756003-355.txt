The tendon of this muscle is applied to the_ posterior surface of that of the internal oblique, with which It passes both behind and in front of the rectus. The upper and anterior part of the transversalis is muscular,, where the corresponding part of the internal oblique is ten- dmous. Its principal use is that of a compressor of the viscera of the abdomen. The fascia lumhorum is described in connection with the muscles of the back, and should be studied when they are dissected. The internal oblique and transversalis muscles arc sometimes described as arising directly from the vertebree-

126 an incision in the course of the linea alba from the pubes to opposite the anterior and superior spinous process of the ilium, and another transversely to meet it from that process; the integ-uments are then to be turned back as far as the groin: This will bring into view a layer of that kind of cellular membrane before described, which has been named the aponeurosis of the ex- ternal oblique; in tracing it downwards it will be observed to extend over the groin and to adapt itself to the spermatic cord in passing down upon it, and if a blow- pipe be inserted under it at that part the air thrown in will be found to diffuse itself over the cellular membrane of the surface of the scrotum. In order to display the lower portion of the external oblique, a flap of the aponeurosis like that of the integu- ments is to be dissected back as low down as Poupart's ligament: This termination of the external oblique muscle will be seen stretched between the spinous process of the os pubis and the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium; the edge which it forms at this partis however indistinct, as

13 INTRODUCTION. In the description of the arteries, par- ticular regard is had to their relative po- sition ; the parts therefore are enumerated in the neighbourhood of which they are V taking their course, and their situation with respect to them shewn. It is to be studied where compression may be easily employed ; with this view the points must be sought where they are running over bone, where deeply embedded betwixt muscles, or where they are superficially placed. Their chief anastomoses are to be pointed out, that the power of preserving life in a part, by their enlargement, may be esti- mated, when the principal trunk supply- ing it has become obliterated. Their situa- tion is important in the planning and the executing of operations. The accidents to which they are liable, should be con- sidered, together with the ready way of getting at them ; for without a previous knowledge of their exact position, the ob- scurity occasioned by haemorrhage at the time of their injury, renders their dis- covery doubly perplexing. These are the points which chiefly interest the practical

88 iside the internal jugular vein, and the ner- vus vasrus situated between it and the ca- rotid, take their course : the nerve, the vein and the artery are enclosed within a sheath of cellular membrane. Behind the jugular vein, but exterior to -the sheath, is placed the si/mpathetic nerve. In the course of the carotid is a^ chain of absorhent glands, [glandulac concate- natae] which receive lymphatics from the head and neck. A small nerve, [the nervus superficialis cardiacus] formed from the superior cer- vical ganglion and internal laryngeal nerve, is passing along the inner edge of the carotid.

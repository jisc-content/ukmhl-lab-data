135 covers the muscles at the fore part of the thigh, and in a great measure the femoral vessels, hut over them terminates in a more or less distinct crescent-shaped edge [sometimes called the falciform process]; â€”and an inner, deeper-seated and thinner portion attached to the pubes, which covers the muscles at the inner part of the thigh, seems to pass behind the femoral vessels, and unites with the outer portion some little way below the crural arch. Through this opening of the fascia lata^ thus formed by its two portions, a part of . the sheath of the femoral vessels may be perceived; and the vena saphcena major^ which rises up from the inner part of the thigh,* may be traced to its termination at. the femoral vein. AVhen the absorbent s:lands are removed which are seated about this part, the inner side of the femoral sheath will be found to have numerous perforations ; this cribriform structure al- lows of the communication between the inguinal absorbent glands and those situa- ted within the sheath, but renders the fas- cia forming the sheath weaker at this part.

are seen extended obliquely towards the os hyoidcs. The disposition of the other j)arts may be displayed by commencing at the back part, and continuing the dissec- tion forwards. An incision along the anterior margin of the upper extremity of the sterno-ihastoid will expose the nervus accessorius ad par oclavum; it appears between the transverse process of tlie atlas and the internal jugular vein ; lower down it is covered by the sterno-niastoid muscle which it perforates to reach the trapezius. Nearer to the angle of the jaw than the accessory nerve, but in contact with it, is the internal jugular vein; next to it the lingual nerve ; and then \\\^intcrnal carotid artery, which is deeper seated than the external carotid. The lingual nerve ap- pears between the internal x:arotid and ju- gular vein, a little lower than the line of the lower jaw; at the origin of the occipi- tal artery it turns forward to cross over both carotids, and at this place sends ofl' the ramus descendens noni; it continues its course behind the termination of the facial vein, but before the external carotid artery;

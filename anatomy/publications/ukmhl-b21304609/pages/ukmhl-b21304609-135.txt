ported on the anterior part of the tubero- sities of the ischia. But in the different postures of the body, the relation of the axis of the pelvis to that of the vertebral column becomes consielerably altered: In the horizontal posture the angle is more acute, and when the thighs are completely bent upon the trunk, as in placing a pa- tient for the operation of lithotomy, the line of the axis of the pelvis and that of the spine will be parallel. It is to be borne in mind that the pelvic viscera will be ma- terially intiuenced in position by these changes of posture. The outlet of the pelvis is occupied in both sexes by a part of the genital organs. It forms three eminences and three depres- sions. The eminences are the two tuberosi- ties of the ischia on the fore part, and the os coccygis behind, which does not descend nearly so low as the other eminences from circumstances that have been already ex- plained. Of the depressions one, the arch of the pubes, is situated anteriorly. The other two depressions are comprehended between the ilia, ischia, sacrum and os g2

119 Relative Position of the Brachial Artery. The brachial artery passes from the ax- illa to the bend of the elbow: During the greater part of its course it is situated to the inner side of the arm. As it descends it is placed more superficially and ante- riorly : At the elbow it occupies the mid- dle of the articulation. Anteriorlyy it is covered by the coraco- brachialis muscle, but separated from it by cellular membrane. In the rest of its course it corresponds and is nigh to the inner edge of the biceps muscle. At the bend of the elbow it is covered by the apo- neurosis, the basilic median vein, by cel- lular membrane and the common integu- ments. Posteriorly, it is separated from the tri- ceps muscle by fat and cellular membrane; but lower it is passing upon the brachialis internus. To the inner side, it is immediately adjacent to the brachial vein and median

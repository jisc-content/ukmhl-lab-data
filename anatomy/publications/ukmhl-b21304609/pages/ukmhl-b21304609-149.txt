137 removed, and the muscles of the perineum may be dissected. The arteria perinei, a branch of the internal pudendal, will be seen entering the perineum between the sphincter arii and erector penis; it continues its course between the bulb and crus of the penis towards the scrotum, to which it is distributed, giving branches to the accele- rator urinae, erector penis, sphincter ani and cellular substance of perineum. By separating the bulb and crus of the 'penis, and removing theacceleratores urinae, it will be found that the triangular space formed by the rami of the ischia and pubes is occupied by a ligamentous septum at- tached to them, to which the bulb of the penis is firmly bound down, and through which the urethra, where it forms its mem- branous part, is* passing. The dissection is to be continued in the space behind the anus and tuberosities of the ischia, which is bounded behind by the os coccygis, and laterally by the edges of theglutaei inaximi muscles, which are pass- ing from the os coccygis behind the tube- â€™ rosities of the ischia. The extremity of the rectum is situated in the middle of the

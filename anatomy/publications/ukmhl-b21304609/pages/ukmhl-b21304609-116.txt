At this part it may be cut down upon by beginning an incision at the root of the mastoid process, and continuing it along the anterior margin of the sterno-niastoid muscle; then prosecuting the dissection the nerve will be found after cutting through a part of the glandular substance of the parotid: The arteria posterior auris and one of the branches of the cervical to the ear will necessarily be divided. Soon after quitting the foramen stylo-mastoi- deum it enters the parotid, and divides into branches which are passing upwards, forwards and downwards to be distribut- ed to the face and throat. About midway between the ascending plate of the jaw- bone and the mastoid process it is oppo- site to the external carotid artery. The attachments of the parotid gland may now be traced: To understand its real extent it must be followed to the root of the meatus auditorius externus, behind the angle of the jaw adhering to the internal pterygoid muscle, folded over the poste*

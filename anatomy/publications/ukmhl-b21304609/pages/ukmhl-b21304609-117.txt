105 rior edge of the masseter muscle and deep seated between the ascending plate of the jaw-bone and mastoid process. The ex- ternal carotid after passing up from behind the stylo-hyoideus and digastricus is like- wise buried in the substance of this gland; it continues its course upwards, and whilst connected with the parotid, gives oft' the posterior aural, the transverse facial, and the internal maxillary arteries. It is cross- ed within the gland by the portio dura about one inch above the angle of the jaw. Some ahsorhent glands are connected with the exterior of the parotid gland. The duct of the parotid is arising from the anterior margin of the gland: Its course may be marked generally by a line drawn from the junction of the lobe of the ear with the pinna to the root of the nose. It receives often a small duct from a corres- ponding glandular process situated above it on the masseterâ€”the glandula accesso- ria of Haller, of the same structure as the parotid. The duct continues its course in the just described direction over the anterior margin of the masseter muscle, F 3

INTRODUCTION. 10 anatomist in the manner of investigating them. With this view, the parts more essentially connected with important func- tion, disease, or injury, become succes- sively the subjects of inquiry. Thus the bone's are particularly de- scribed : They are, as it were, the ground- work of relative position; they form a frame-work to all the softer parts; and in giving them figure and support, constitute the form of the body. From their un- yielding texture, they may be readily dis- tinguished by the touch, although hidden to the sight when surrounded by the softer parts; they therefore serve as a guide to these in the neighbourhood. The form of the ends of bones, with their means of adaptation to each other, is perha})s the most essential part of their study. An accurate knowledge of these assists great- ly in the diagnosis of the often obscure fractures about joints, and is indispens- ably requisite in that of dislocations. It requires particular attention to their figure, more esjiecially when surrounded by the soft parts, to the prominent points which

106 and enters a holloio space, which extends from the masseter, between the projecting part of the superior maxillary bone above, and the inferior maxilla below', to the cor- ner of the mouth, the side of the nose, and the inner angle of the eye; whose bottom is formed by the buccinator mus- cle and upper jaw, and which is lengthen- ed to the articulation of the lower jaw and the space covered by the zygoma by a sinus formed by the buccinator muscle and upper jaw behind and the masseter and lower jaw before. In this space the duct is lodged in a mass of fat which is interposed between the masseter and buc- cinator, perforates the latter and termi- nates in the mouth opposite to the second molar tooth. The duct is accompanied by the arteria transversalis faciei, which is given off from the external carotid whilst within the substance of the parotid, is in- clined upward and becomes situated be- tw^een the parotid duct and zygoma. It is accompanied likewise by branches from the portio dura the largest of which takes its course some little way above it. N^ar

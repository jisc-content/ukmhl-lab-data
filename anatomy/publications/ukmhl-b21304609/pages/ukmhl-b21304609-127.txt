vated the shoulder somewhat with the el- bow close to the side so as to relax in a degree the pectoral muscle, the dissection is prosecuted between the deltoid and pec- toral muscles, turning the latter carefully on one side. At this part the cephalic vein is taking its course between those muscles and behind the pectoral towards the axil- lary vein, and the humeral thoracic artery is seen winding up to the deltoid. Deeper than the above mentioned muscles the space is circumscribed by the subclavian and pectoralis minor muscles above and below, but it retains the same lateral boun- daries : It is crossed on the upper part by a ligamentous production from the under part of the clavicle to the root of the cora- coid process. Posteriorly at the edge of the pectoralis minor, and partly covered by it, the axillary vein will be seen passing outwards and downwards. Above, behind, and partly hid by it, the axillary artery is taking the same course. The axillary plexus is situated still more posteriorly; part is situated above, and part is hidden by the artery.

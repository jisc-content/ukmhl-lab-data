116 these parts will be altered by the state of the shoulder:—If elevated, the pectoralis major becomes relaxed, [if much, the pecto- ralis minor becomes stretched,] and the space of the artery will be more exposed: —If the shoulder be depressed, the space will be straightened from side to side. The axilla may be considered as a pyra- midal cavity, whose sides are formed by the pectoralis major and minor on the fore part, by the scapula subscapularis and la- tissimus dorsi on the back part, by the ribs and serratus magnus to the inner side; whose apex is the coracoid process, and whose base is determined by the edges of the pectoralis major and latissimus dorsi. It is occupied by blood-vessels, nerves, ab- sorbent glands embedded in fat and cel- lular membrane. The view of the contained parts must be gained from below. For this purpose the arm is to be turned up towards the side of the head; the triangular form of the base will then become apparent, the pectoralis major and latissimus dorsi muscles having been put on the stretch. The dissection is then to be begun at the

The saw is next to be applied at a point on the parietes of the cranium corresponding to the anterior edge of the glenoid cavity, and a cut is to be made which shall meet the first at the sella tur- cica, and is then to be carried perpendi- cularly through the basis of the cranium. These cuts will insulate a triangular por- tion of the bones of the head and face. Their removal will give an opportunity of examining several parts connected vvitli practice, viz.—The extent and form of the cavities of the nose.— The openings into it from the lachrymal sac,' the aiitrum max- illare, the frontal, ethmoidal and sphe?ioi-

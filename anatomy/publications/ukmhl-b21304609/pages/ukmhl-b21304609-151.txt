139 tents of the pelvis [of which the best gene- ral idea is gained by the side-view of the pelvic viscera, which the student is sup- posed to have made himself master ofâ€”] the dissection may be varied and be begun from behind. The glutaei muscles are to be raised at the back part, and the whole posterior part of the pelvis is to be laid bare. A perpen- dicular section of the pelvis is then to be made by cutting through the ilia from their cristge into the upper part of the ischiadic notch: The rectum is to be cut through about three inches above the anus, and the upper portion removed with the sacrum. By thus laying bare the cavity of the pelvis, the relative situation of its contents may be examined without that displacement which some of them undergo in making the side view of the pelvis. The form and situation of the urinary bladder will be well dis- played, especially if it be inflated to about half its capacity : The peritonaeum will be observed to cover its posterior surface, and afterwards to turn upon the anterior and inferior part of the rectum. It is to be

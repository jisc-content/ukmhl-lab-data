122 an oval cavity, which is rendered more ca- pacious laterally by the hollows of the ilia. It communicates by an oval-like opening [which is the upper opening of the pelvis] with an inferior cavity: This is a kind of canal, large in the middle, and contracted at its extremities, the inferior of which forms an opening called the outlet of the pelvis. If is in this inferior cavity that the pelvic viscera are chiefly contained, and in a practical point it is their relation to the outlet [or inferior opening of the pel- vis] which is the most important. The axis of the pelvis, or a line which is car- ried through the middle of the inferior cavity, forms a considerable angle with the axis of the spine; so that when the body is in the erect posture the anterior and superior spinous processes of the ilia and the most prominent point of the pubes are nearly in the same perpendicular plane, the sacrum and posterior parts of the ilia become proportionably elevated, the superior opening faces upwards and for- wards, and the outlet is turned downward and backward: In sitting, the body is sup-

145 part of a triangular figure ; it is bounded by the semi-tnembranosus and semi-tendino'- sus at the inner side, by the biceps cruris muscle at the outer. This diverging'of the flexors of the leg may be observed in the living body, and the prominences which they form have been vulgarly called the ham-strings. The triangular space above described is lengthened below by the separation between the heads of the gastrocnemii muscles^ both of which are re- ceived between the inferior extremities of the flexors. Having removed some of the fat which fills the bend of the joint, the posterior crurtd nerve will be seen at the upper part to divide into the posterior tibial and peroneal nerves; the first descends nearly vertically, whilst the latter is taking the course of the biceps. Prosecuting the dissection by penetrating deeper than the posterior tibial nerve, a little to its inner side, and partly covered by it, the popliteal vein will be seen, and still deeper seated in some degree to the inner side of the vein, the popliteal artery. Considerable branches are given off by the artery, the H

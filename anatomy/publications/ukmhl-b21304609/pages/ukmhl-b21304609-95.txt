83 arteria innomiiiata: y. Direction, the right passing immediately upwards and out- wards in the space of the scaleni, whilst the left passes first vertically upwards, then suddenly bends outward between the scaleni: Relative position, the right being placed more anteriorly, on the outer side near to the summit of the [right] lung,, and behind separated from the vertebral column and longus colli, to which it cor- responds ; the left being covered from its origin by the corresponding lung, separated from the first rib and clavicle, and closely applied to the longus colli. Their course, after having gained the space between the scaleni, becomes the same:. They pass transversely between these muscles, are inclined downward and outwards, become placed between the axillary plexus and clavicle, pass the latter at an acute angle, being covered by it and the subclavian muscle, and change their name to that of the axillary arteries. In the space between the scaleni and clavicle they have behind them and to their outer side the nerves of the axillary plexus, and to the inner side 1

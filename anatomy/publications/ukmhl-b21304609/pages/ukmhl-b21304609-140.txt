128 near the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium. Detaching tlieii the tendon ft’om the parts behind, above and below, the lowest fibres of the internal oblique will be seen, particularly those neither numerous jior strong which are passing from the outer half of Poupart’s ligament to the pubes. Beneath its under edge the sper- matic cord is obliquely passing to the external opening and acquiring a part of its muscular covering, as some fibres of the cremaster muscle are given off from the internal oblique. An incision through the internal, like that through the exter- nal oblique, shews the transversalis muscle disposed much in the same way as the internal oblique, its fibres few and weak, where arising from Poupart’s ligament and becoming tendinous towards the pubes behind the external opening. The rest of the cremaster not furnished by the inter- nal oblique is derived from the transver- salis. It will be evident from the forearo- O ing that if a blunt instrument be passed through the external abdominal ring it will be prevented from passing into the abdo-

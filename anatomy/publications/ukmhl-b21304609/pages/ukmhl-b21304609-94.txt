8*2 of the scalenus anticus muscle, is the Sub- clavian artery, the large arterial trunk which supplies the shoulder and upper extremity. In examining the relative po- sition of this artery on the right and on the leftside, some difference will be found, caused principally by the difference of origin. The aorta, in forming its arch, passes obliquely backwards and to the left; the vessels therefore, which are aris- ing from it, are placed in an oblique plane, the arteria innominata being the most an- terior and to the right, the left subclavian artery, which arises immediately from the aorta, the most posterior and to the left. The arteria innominata, having passed the trachea, [therefore after a course of about one inch,] divides into the right sub- clavian and right common carotid arte- ries. The subclavian arteries differ in conse- quence on the right and left sides in; Â«. Situation, the right being more superficial, the left deeply hid [arising farther back from the arch of the aorta]: /?. Length, the right being shorter by the length of the

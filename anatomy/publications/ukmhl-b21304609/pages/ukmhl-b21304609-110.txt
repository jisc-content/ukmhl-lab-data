98 the digastric muscle, and around the root of the mastoid process just above tlie transverse process of the atlas. Above the hyo-glossus muscle the gustatory nerve [tlie lingual branch of the third division of the fifth pair of nerves] runs towards the tongue. The glosso-pharyngeal nerve makes its appearance from between the carotids just at the origin of the stylo-pharyngeus, and is as well as that muscle sunk behind the jaw bone. ■ Behind the cavity of the submaxillary gland, the tonsil lies deep seated, sunk in the recess formed by the pillars of the fauces, situated in the angle between the stylo-glossus and stylo-pharyngeus, and covered by the palato-pharyngeus.—The external carotid is nearly opposite to the tonsil, the internal a little behind it.

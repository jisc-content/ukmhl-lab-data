The organs contained within the ])elvis are protected by the peculiar form and disposition of the bones, assisted at the sides by the thick muscles at that part, and the parts of the femoral bones about their articulation, especially the trochan- ters ; at the back part by the muscular mass attached to it and the posterior pro- jections of the ilia.

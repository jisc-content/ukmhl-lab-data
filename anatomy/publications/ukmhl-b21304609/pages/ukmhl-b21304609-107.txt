95 along the side of the gland nearest to the earj generally about this part joins with the temporal vein, and these together are forming the external jugular vein. Situ- ated more under the anterior portion of the tongue between the mylo-hyoideus and genio-glossus is the sublingual gland. By bending the head back, the relative situation of these parts is altered, par- ticularly of the submaxillary gland, the facial artery and vein. By the elevation of the chin the cavity between the maxilla, and mylo-hyoideus becomes reduced in size, and those parts, which in the usual position of the head lie retired behind the jaw, are exposed. This position is favorable for the con- tinuation of the dissection, which may be prosecuted by removing the inferior portion of the parotid gland, so as to lay bare the anterior margin of the sterno-mastoid and the posterior edge of the ascending plate of the jaw bone : The parts situated about the angle may then be conveniently examined. The posterior belly of the di- gastricus and the stylo-hyoideus muscle

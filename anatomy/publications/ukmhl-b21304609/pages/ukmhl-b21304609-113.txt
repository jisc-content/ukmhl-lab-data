101 veins^ arising on the left from the sub-â€™ claviaii vein, on the right from the superior cava, are placed on each side the trachea, but on its fore part are forming an arch from which branches are passing off to the gland. In the young subject, the relative dis- tances of the parts situated between the chin and sternum are differing from the adult structure. This difference is the result of the non-evolution of the lower jaw and larynx. When the alveolar pro- cesses are not formed, and the ascending plate and angle of the inferior maxilla are not developed, the bifurcation of the-ca- rotid will be found at a greater distance from the angle, and the primary branches of the external carotid exposed, which are concealed in a great measure in the adult by the lower jaw. Before the develope- ment of the larynx, which does not take place in the male till puberty, and not all in the female, there will be proportionably a greater length of trachea, and hence a greater distance between the thyroid gland, and the sternum.

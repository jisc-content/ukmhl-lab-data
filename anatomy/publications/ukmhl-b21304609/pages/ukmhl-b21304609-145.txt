133 versalis, which has been already spoken of as forming the internal abdominal ring, in describing the parts connected with ingui- nal hernia. After lining the posterior part of the abdominal muscles and being close- ly attached to the crural arch, it unites on the outer side with the fascia iliaca between the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium, and the iliac vessels, the place of their junction being marked by a white line; on the inner it is extending to the pubes, but becoming thinner and less distinct, and it is sending out a process which descends behind the crural arch and passes before the femoral vessels into the thigli. The portion of the fascia iliaca which is passing with the femoral vessels from behind, and the portion of the fascia transversalis wdiich is passing with them from before, appear by their union at the sides to form the femoral sheath; this at the beginning is of a funnel shape which is flattened from before to behind, it becomes con- tracted a little below the crural arch. By detaching the sheath from its con- nexions on the pubic side, it will be found

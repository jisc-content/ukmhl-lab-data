134 that to the inner side the space behind the crural arch is narrowed by a horizontal portion of tendon of a triangular figure extending from the arch to the opposite part of the os pubis, and presenting a sharp edge towards the femoral vein : It is called Gimhernafs ligament or the third insertion of the external oblique muscle. The dissection is to be prosecuted by examining the relation and connexion of these parts with those situated externally. After removing the integuments, that which has been called the aponeurosis of the ex- ternal oblique may be traced extending over the groin and descending upon the thigh : It covers the inguinal glands, which are clustered together at this part, and portions of it are dipping in between them. The aponeurosis may now be dissected back to display thefascia lata, which will be seen attached to Pouparfs ligament rendering its rounded edge indistinct. But the fas- cia lata may be said to be composed of two portions at the upper part:—an outer and more dense one attached to nearly the whole extent of Poiipart’s ligament, which

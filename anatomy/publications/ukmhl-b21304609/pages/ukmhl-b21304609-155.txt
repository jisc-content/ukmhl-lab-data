143 passage through the tendon of the ad- ductor. Posteriorly:—It is placed in its passage behind the crural arch on the os pubis, but is separated from it by the pectineus : To this and the adductor brevis and lon- gus muscles, it corresponds in the rest of its course, more or less fat being inter- posed between it and the latter. To the outer side :—It is contiguous to the anterior crural nerve, and the psoas and iliacus muscles. It corresponds to the sartorius at some distance. Below it is closely applied to the vastus internus, which separates it from the os femoris. To the inner side:—It is accompanied by the femoral vein which is inclined to its posterior side. It approaches the adductor, and is close to it below. It will be remarked therefore that the fe- moral artery is taking its course close to bone at two places,—at the os pubis above, behind the crural arch, and below near to the os femoris. Superiorly it has the more immediate bony support, as the moderate thickness of the pectineus muscle is alone

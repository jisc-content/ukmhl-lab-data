140 carefully dissected from the gut, and will be seen to leave it at the base of the vesi- culsB semiiiales, but to be attached some little way downwards between them, ending in a semicircular line the convexity of which is anteriorly. Proceeding with the dissection between the bladder and rectum, the vesiculce seminales are to be cleaned, without detaching them from their situ- ation, and the space is to be examined which is formed between them by the at- tachment of the peritonaeum behind and by the vasa deferentia, placed to the inner side of the vesiculae seminales, laterally. A triangular portion of the bladder is thus circumscribed, between which and the rectum only a small quantity of cellular substance is interposed. The apex of this triangle is situated about two inches higher than the verge of the anus, the prostate being unenlarged. At the neck of the bladder the Prostate gland is placed, directly above the junction of the acceleratores urinae w ith the sphincter ani: Its extent may be felt by passing the fin- ger up the rectum, and it is displayed by

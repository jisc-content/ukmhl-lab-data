It is circumscribed: above, by the lower jaw and parotid gland; before, by the muscles attached to the os hyoides; be- hind, by the inner edge of the sterno-mas- toid muscle. It is deepened by the pro^ jection of the larynx and trachea and by its continuation behind the lower jaw. In order not to lay bare too many parts at once, this division of the neck may be conveniently subdivided into two parts by a line drawn horizontally from the os hy- oides [at which part the common carotid divides into the external and internal ca- rotid arteries] to a corresponding point on the sterno-cleido-mastoideus. â€˜ Lower Subdivision of the upper Space.

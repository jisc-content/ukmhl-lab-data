80 the clavicle; therefore by the depression of the -clavicle the parts situated within are brought nearer to the surface, whilst the space itself is rendered longer. Before the dissection the arm should be depressed as much as possible, in order to bring down the clavicle. In order to display the parts, a triangular flap of in- teguments corresponding to the figure of the space is to be turned back; it may be made by carrying an incision along the outer edge of the sterno-mastoid muscle, and another to meet it along the upper edge of the clavicle. The fibres of the j)latysma myoides and the aponeurosis are to be turned back in the same way; pro- ceSsfes of the latter will be seen to dip in between the contained parts. The bed of cellular membrane next presents itself. This is to be removed, dissecting out with care the several larger cutaneous veins, branches of arteries, and twigs of nerves; the last coming from the cervical nerves. The.^xternal jugular vein is crossing ob- liquely the sterno-mastoid and this space, to terminate behind the clavicle in the

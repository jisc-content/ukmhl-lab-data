89 course, and connexion of the carotid and subclavian arteries nearer to the trunk, as well as their relation to other important parts, the dissection may be prosecuted by raising cautiously the attachment of the sterno-mastoid muscle to the clavicle and sternum. In the narrow space behind this muscle the subclavian artery, before it has passed the scaleni muscles, is connected with the nervus vagus, the recurrent laryn- geal, sympathetic and phrenic nerves, the subclavian vein, on the left with the termi- nation of the thoracic duct, the carotid artery and internal jugular vein. Of the course and relative position of the subclavian artery has been already spoken, in the description of the lower space of the side of the neck. At this part it will be seen passing behind the scalenus anticus muscle after the passage of about an inch. At the edge of that muscle it is giving off the cervical arteries: The inferior thyroideal artery is passing upwards and inwards behind the carotid â€¢artery: Branches of the anterior cervi- .cal. are seen in the space above, the

will be hereafter explained. Above and a little to the outer side of the spinous process of the os pubis the fibres of the tendon of the external oblique, interlaced as it were by other tendinous fibres, separate to form an opening* which is called the abdominal ring [or to distinguish it from another opening presently to be spoken of, the ex- ternal abdominal ring]; it is however neither to be considered round, nor as appearing an opening, for it is occupied in some measure by the cellular membrane which is filling up all interstices. Through it the spermatic cord is passing from the pa- rietes of the abdomen to the scrotum, and becoming invested at this part as before described by the aponeurosis of the exter- nal oblique. The next part of the dissection is for the purpose of tracing the oblique course of the cord from its leaving the abdomen to the part where it is making its appearance externally. It is to be done by carrying an incision from a little above the external abdominal ring in a somewhat semicircu- lar direction outwards to opposite and

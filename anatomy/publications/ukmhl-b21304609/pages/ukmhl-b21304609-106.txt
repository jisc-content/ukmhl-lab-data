that part. Near to the chin is the anterior belly of the digastricus. A small portion of the submaxillary gland, which is si- tuated within the jaw, appears below it: It is lodged in a considerable cavity between the jaw bone and the tongue, which appears when the gland is cut away. The roof of this hollow toward the chin is formed by the mylo-hyoideus, and nearer to the angle of the jaw by the hyo-glossus; the latter is intersected by the stylo-glossus. In this position of the head, the submaxil- lary gland is almost entirely covered by the body of the jaw bone; it is received between the two bellies of the digastric muscle and that bone. In this cavity besides the submaxillary are lodged ab- sorbent glands, likewise the facial artery and vein, together with the branches sent off from them, before they mount on to the face. The facial artery at its origin is concealed by the jaw, passes under the stylo-hyoideus and tendon of the digastri- cus, and before its passage over the jaw is embedded in the substance of the sub- maxillary gland. The facial vein descends

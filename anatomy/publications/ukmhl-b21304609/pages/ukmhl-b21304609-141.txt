129 men by the interposition of the tendon of the transversalis muscle. The fibres of the transversalis are now to be cautiously raised, beginning near to the spinous pro- cess of the iliiini and cutting through the cremaster: A fascia will then be found to line its posterior surface, apparently at- tached to Poupartâ€™s ligament, of consider- able thickness near to the ilium, but be- coming thinner and more like cellular membrane towards the pubes : 'This is the fascia transversalis. In tracing the sper- matic cord towards the abdomen, it seems to disappear about mid-way between the spinous process of the pubes and ilium; by insinuating a blunt instrument along the cord, and detaching the cellular mem- brane from around it, it will be found to pass through an opening in the fascia above described, which has been called the internal abdominal ring. This open- ing is lined posteriorly by the peritonaeum, and it is here that the snermatic cord is JL formed, the vas deferens i)assing down into the pelvis, whilst the spermatic vessels imd nerves are derived from above.

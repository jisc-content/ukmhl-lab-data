81 subclavian vein. Continuing the dissec- tion behind the level of the sterno^inastoid, several absorbent glands will be found, as at the outer edge of the last named mus- cle, in the neighbourhood of the axillary plexus. The omo-hyoideus muscle traverses the space obliquely, and passes behind the sterno-mastoid; a line, drawn from . a point on this muscle about two inches above the sternum to the junction of the clavicle with the scapula, marks its course. The Scale7tus anticMS and medius muscles are deeply seated behind and a little to the outer side of the sterno-mastoid. From between these behind the omo-hyoideus the fotir inferior cervical and first dorsal nerves are'passing outwards and down- .wards to between the subclavian muscle and first rib, to form the axillary plexus : two or three of these are situated above .the omo-hyoideus. lH\\e Subclavian Vein is seated behind the sternal portion of the clavicle; it passes outwards and down- wards from before the scalenus anticus behind the clavicle. Somewliat above it and more posteriorly from the intervention. E 3

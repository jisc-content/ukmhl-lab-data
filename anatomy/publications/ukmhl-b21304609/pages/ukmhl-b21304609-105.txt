93 cending plate of the maxilla inferior, the meatus-auditorius externiis is placed. The ascending plate is about two inches in length, and the angle of the jaw about one inch anterior to the cervical vertebrse. A little before the root of the mastoid process, I but nearer to the centre of the base of the skull, the styloid process begins; its ex- tremity in the adult, in whom the lower jaw is furnished with teeth, is hidden by the ascending plate of the jaw bone. In this position of parts, when the muscles are not in action, the pharynx is flattened â€˜ on its posterior side, which is in contact with the vertebral column, the larynx rests. The os hyoides is nearly as high as the lower margin of the jaw bone; hence the posterior belly of the digastric muscle has only a slight declination, Avhilst the anterior runs straight -forward. On removing the coverings of this sub- division [which it has in common witli the rest of the neck,] the inferior portion of the parotid gland will be seen to project below the inferior maxilla behind its angle, and to rest on the sterno-mastoid opposite

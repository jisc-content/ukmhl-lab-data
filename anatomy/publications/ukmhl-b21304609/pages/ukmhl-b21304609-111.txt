99 Fore part of the Neck. On the fore part of the neck, the relations of the larynx, trachea, and parts connected with them, remain to be studied. They are received between the diverging bellies of the sterno-mastoid muscles. Their situa- tion may be ascertained, without removing their coverings; and should be practised in the living person. In the adult, when the base of the skull is placed horizontally, the os hyoides will be felt a little lower than the level of the edge of the jaw. Under it is the thyroid cartilage at some little distance, the part called the pomum adami with its notch distinctly projecting: Its prominent edge on the anterior part may be traced downwards, as it somewhat recedes.

The trachea occupies the angular hollow form- ed by the approximation of the sterno-

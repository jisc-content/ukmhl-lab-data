INTRODUCTION. 9 industry of its cultivators, a collection of numerous, but generally insulated facts; and our ignorance of their meaning and connexion has become apparent in pro- portion to their number. This condition of the science has influenced its language, and left the attention without direction in its cultivation;—names have been multi- plied, which neither describe nor explain, and numerous ones have been applied, without discrimination, to single parts ;— description has been exhausted, without adding to our know ledge, and without re- ference to the importance of structure and function.

But the state of the science, and the circumstances of the student, are not perhaps the greatest bars to improve-

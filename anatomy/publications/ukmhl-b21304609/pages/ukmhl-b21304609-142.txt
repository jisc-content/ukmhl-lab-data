130 The relation then of the internal abdo- minal ring to the external opening is that whilst the latter is situated at the spinous process of the pubes, the former is placed midway between the spinous process of the pubes, and the anterior superior spi- nous process of the ilium, at the distance of an inch and a half from it, and above a line which is drawn from the top of the external opening horizontally outwards. The space between the two openings is called the inguinal canal. Consequently the direction of the spermatic cord within the canal will be inwards, downwards and somewhat forwards; in its course passing under the edges of the internal oblique and transversalis muscles deriving from them its muscular covering the cre- master, and receiving after it has passed the external opening, a further covering from the aponeurosis of the external ob- lique. The epigastric artery, in taking its course from its origin at the external iliac, in- wards and upwards to the rectus, is situa- ted a little to the inner side of'the internal

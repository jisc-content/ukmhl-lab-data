8o platysma myoides and aponeurosis, along‚Äù the inner edge of the sterno-mastoid, and another to meet its outer extremity in the direction of the line which forms the upper boundary of this subdivision: Then by turning back this triangular flap and dis- secting away the cellular membrane. The omo-hyoideus will be seen continued from behind the sterno-mastoid crossing it near- ly opposite to the upper margin of the cri- coid cartilage. The place, at which the decussation takes place, may be ascertain- ed by stretching a thread between the an- terior part of the mastoid process of the temporal bone and the centre of the upper bone of the sternum, to mark the course of the inner edge of the sterno-cleido-mas- toideus ; and another, for the direction of the omo-hyoideus, between the side of the body of the os hyoides and the centre [nearly] of the clavicle. Behind the point of intersection the common carotid is com- monly placed. Next to the omo-hyoideus. is the sterno-hyoideus; but more anteriorly, interiorly and less oblique. To these mus- cles small twigs are given off from the

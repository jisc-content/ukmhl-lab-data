90 clavicle. At the origin of the subclavian it is crossed anteriorly behind the sternal extremity of the clavicle by the nervus vagtis. That nerve, in its passage before it, gives off the recurrent laryngeal nerve ; which on the right side hooks round the subclavian artery, but on the left passes around the arch of the aorta, and then takes its course upwards and inwards by the side of the sympathetic nerve, to the posterior and lateral parts of the trachea. Opposite to the nervus vagus, but behind the subclavian, is the sympathetic nervCt with its lower cervical ganglion. The sub- clavian vein lies anterior to the artery, in its collapsed state seems lower, and passes the clavicle in a more horizontal direction, and nearer to its sternal extremity: The direction of the nerves forming the axillary plexus is more oblique than that of the artery, and their situation nearer to the scapula. The internal jugular vein cotes the margin of the scalenus and joins with the subclavian vein below: It is at this junction on the left side, that the termina- tion of the thoracic duct after coming from

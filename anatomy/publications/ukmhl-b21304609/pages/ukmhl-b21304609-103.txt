l)l behind the jugular vein may be traced. To the outer and fore part of the scalenus anticus, the pkrettic nerve is placed, which continues its course into the thorax between the subclavian artery and vein. The removal of the omo-hyoidei, sterno- thyroidei, and sterno-hyoidei, displays the course of the common carotids at the root of the neck. The right given off from the arteria innominata after it has passed the trachea, the left from the arch of the aorta; they diverge on each side of the trachea, and as they separate from each other are , inclined backwards. The left is somewhat longer than the right, and is covered at its origin by the left subclavian vein and cla- vicle. Of the rest of their relative position has been already spoken.

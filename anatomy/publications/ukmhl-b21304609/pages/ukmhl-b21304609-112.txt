100 mastoid muscles above the upper bone of the sternum. If the head be turned back, the relative situation of these parts will be altered, so that they are more separated from each other, and a larger portion of the trachea becomes situated in the neck. In this position the parts may be laid bare ; but the dissection should be proceeded in with caution so as to shew the situation and extent of the thyroid gland, with its re- ' lation and connexion to the surrounding parts. Its two lobes will be seen placed at the under and lateral "parts of the larynx, covered by the sterno-hyoidei, and stcrno-thyroidei, descending a little way on the trachea and aesophagus, and con- nected by a cross portion on the fore and upper part of the trachea. The gland is supplied by the four thyroideal arteries ; the two superior are descending upon its upper margin from their origin at the be- ginning of the external carotid; the two inferior arise from the subclavian, and are ascending on each to the inferior part of this gland. The inferior thyroideal

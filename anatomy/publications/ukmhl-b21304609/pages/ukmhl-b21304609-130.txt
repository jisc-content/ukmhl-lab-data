118 vein, which opposite to the head of the humerus sinks rather below it; and at that part the axillary plexus passes before it. Posteriorly^ it has the axillary plexus, but lower the fat and cellular membrane filling up the space between the serratus magnus and subscapularis. To the inner side it is near to the second rib and serra- tus magnus ; the artery is then inclined outwards from the parietes of the thorax, becomes separated from them by fat, cel- lular substance and absorbent glands. To the outer side, whilst passing between the clavicle and coracoid process, it is covered by the axillary plexus, and is afterward close to the capsular ligament of the shoulder joint. [Practical Points]. Compression of ax- illary artery— Taking up the artery below the clavicle—Amputation at shoulder joint ‘—Removal of steotomatov^ and other tu- mours from the hollow of the axilla—Ex- tirpation of diseased glands—Ascertain- ment of contamination of axillary glands in schirrous breast.

SECTION II. DISSECTION OF PARTS ABOUT THE CHEST AND UPPER EXTREMITIES. Cavity of the Chest. The diaphragm is a plane of muscular fibres, which together with its middle ten- don is forming the separation between the thorax and abdomen. It is formed into a vault, rising up from its inferior attach- ments as high as the level of the fourth rib, in consequence of which it is applied closely to the lower ribs. Its anterior at- tachments are considerably higher than the posterior; so that the capacity of the chest with respect to height is consider- ably greater at the back than at the fore- part, and the lungs at that part are sink-, ing down behind the abdominal viscera.

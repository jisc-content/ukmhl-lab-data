07 nearer to the os liyoides it passes behind the digastricus and stylo-hyoideiis, lying between them and the stylo-glossus. The lingual nerve is in contact with the lingual artery, until it has reached the side of the tongue, but at that part the hyo-glossus muscle becomes interposed. Till the ar- tery arrives at the junction of the cornu with the body of the os hyoides, it is covered by the skin, platysma myoides, aponeurosis, the lingual nerve, and hyo- glossus muscle: It may therefore be laid bare by dividing these parts, guided by the cornu of the os hyoides. It then turns forward and divides into branches to the substance of the tongue. The branch called the ranina is situated with respect to the fraenum of the tongue just above its attachment. The occipital artery, ari- ses generally from the external carotid, a little lower than the angle of the jaw, in its course it slants upwards and outwards, and traverses the internal carotid, the nervus vagus, the lingual nerve, and the internal jugular vein; it then passes behind F

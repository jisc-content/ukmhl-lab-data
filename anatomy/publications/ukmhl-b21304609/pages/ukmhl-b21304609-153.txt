141 turning on each side the levatores ani at that part. From the prostate is passing tlie membranous part of the urethra under the arch of the pubes. At this part besides the anterior fibres of the levatores ani, pro- cesses of dense cellular membrane are as- sisting in shutting up the cavity of the pelvis. It will be understood from the foregoing description, that the urethra, between the posterior part of the bulb [which is con- nected with the ligamentous septum of the perineum] and its commencement at the bladder, is fixed, from passing through parts which do not admit of motion. It is making likewise between the bulb and its commencement a considerable curve, rising upwards for the space of two inches. Its relation to the arch of the pubes will however be altered in proportion as the , axis of the pelvis is becoming parallel with that of the vertebral column. [Practical Points].

107 to its termination it is crossed by the facial vein; but the artery is inclined consider- ably nearer to the mouth, having quitted the vein after their passage over the lower jaw at the edge of the masseter. The fa- cial vein is begun by the veins of the fore- head; as it descends it is close to the tendon of the orbicularis palpebrarum; it then takes its course obliquely backwards as far as the anterior margin of the masse- ter muscle, having traversed the infra oi;- bitar nerve at its passage from the foramen of the same name. Along its whole ex- tent the vein is nearer to the ear than the artery and at some distance from it, but whilst passing over the inferior maxilla they run parallel and close together. Be- sides the termination of the parotid duct, the facial artery and vein, there are lodged in the space above described twigs of the facial and sub-orbitar nerves. Tlie situa- tion of the infra orhitar nerve may be ascertained by drawing a line from the internal angular process of the os frontis obliquely across the orbit to the centre of the os malee, and another perpendicular

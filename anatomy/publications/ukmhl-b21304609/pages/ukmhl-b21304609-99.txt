87 descendens ?iowe, a nerve which is descend- ing superficially on the common carotid, said to be sometimes enclosed within the sheath of that artery: It is united to twigs from the upper cervical nerves, and is ulti- mately distributed to the above mentioned muscles and the sterno-thyroideus. Of the common carotid artery a small portion [about an inch] only is seen where rising above the omo-hyoideus, and correspond- ing to the edge of the sterno-mastoid mus- cle; below being covered by the omo and sterno hyoidei. Behind, the carotid is separated from the vertebral column, to which it corresponds, by the rectus capitis, anticus major and longua colli muscles, and the inferior thyroideal branch of the subclavian: Before, it is separated from the skin, platysma myoides and aponeu- rosis by the projection of the sterno-mas- toid and parts about the larynx: to the inner side, it corresponds to the larynx, trachea, thyroid gland, which is sometimes continued partly over it, and to the aso- phagus, which is placed nearer somewhat to the left than the right trunk.

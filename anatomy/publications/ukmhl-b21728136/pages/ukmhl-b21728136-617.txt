MUSCLES OF TYMPANUM. 589 The two crura serve to connect the neck of the bone with the base. The base is broad, and is connected to the annular ligament around the margin of the fenestra ovalis. It thus conveys the sound impulse to the labyrinth. The MUSCLES of the tympanum are three in number, and may be described as follows: The tensor tympani. The laxator tympani. The stapedius. Tensor Tympani. Origin. From the under surface of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, and from the cartilaginous portion of the Eustachian tube. Insertion. Into the manubrium and the processus brevis of the malleus, near to the root of that process. Laxator Tympani. (The existence of muscular fibres is denied by some authori- ties, and it is probably a fibrous cord only.) Origin. From the spine of the sphenoid bone, and the Eus- tachian tube. hisertion. Into the processus gracilis of the malleus, and occa- sionally into the neck of that bone. Stapedius. Origin. From the interior of the pyramid, on the inner wall of the tympanum. Insertion. Into the back part of the neck of the stapes. The tensor tympani muscle draws inwards the membrana tym- pani and thus increases the tension of that membrane ; the laxator tympani muscle produces an antagonistic effect upon the mem- brana tympani; while the stapedius muscle, by inclining the stapes backwards, is supposed to compress the fluid contents of the ves- tibule.

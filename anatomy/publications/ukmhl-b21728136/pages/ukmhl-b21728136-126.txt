The sacrum or rump bone consists of five vertebrae blended together into one bone. In some cases the bones entering into the sacrum may be increased to six, and occasionally they may be diminished to four. The shape of the sacrum is that of a quadrangular pyramid with a truncated apex, which looks downwards, while the base is directed upwards. It is situated within the pelvis at its posterior portion, and in the line of direct. continuation of the vertebral column. In the female sex, it is broader, less curved and more obliquely situated within the pelvis. The sacrum forms by its junction with the last lumbar vertebra, a projection into the cavity of the pelvis termed the promontory of the sacrum. This bone presents for examination the following portions: An anterior surface. A posterior surface. Two lateral surfaces. A base. An apex. A canal. Anterior Surface. This portion of the sacrum is concave both from above down- wards and also from side to side. It is traversed by four trans- verse ridges, which indicate the union of the five different pieces of which the bone was composed, and, at the ends of these ridges, are seen the four anterior sacral foramina, through which escape the terminal filaments of the cauda equina, to form the sacral plexus of nerves. Four broad shallow grooves are also present upon each side of this surface of the sacrum, into which the fibres of the pyriformis muscle are inserted, and three prominent ridges divide and separate these grooves, which also give attachment to slips of the same muscle. That part of the bone, where these

When a projection from the surface of a bone is connected to it by cartilage, it is termed an Epiphysis; when, by the process of ossification, the cartilage disappears and it becomes united by bone, it is called an Apophysis. The shaft of a long bone is often called its Diaphysis. Minute Anatomy of Bone. If a transverse section of bone tissue be rendered sufficiently thin to allow of a microscopical examination by transmitted light, it will be found to present for inspection the following points of interest, which have been separately named and which enter prominently into its construction: 1. Haversian Canals. These canals have an average diameter of about of an inch, and are round, oval, or angular in their form. They contain arterial vessels, and, in the larger ones, veins are frequently present. 2. Canaliculi. These small canals vary in size from ttoot to soiUo °f an inch in diameter and serve to connect the Haversian canal with spaces in the bone called lacunae.

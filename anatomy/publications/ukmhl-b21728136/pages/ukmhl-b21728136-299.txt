MUSCLES OF THE ARM. 2 77 drawn forcibly inwards by the teres major, latissimus dorsi and pectoralis major muscles ; and the lower fragment will be drawn upwards by the deltoid. If the shaft of the humerus be fractured below the point of in- sertion of the deltoid, the amount of the deformity will be influ- enced greatly by the direction of the fracture. If the direction of the fracture be transverse, only a slight de- formity will ensue, since the bone still acts as a counter-extend- ing force to the muscles; but, if the direction of the fracture be oblique, the biceps, brachialis anticus, and the triceps muscles will cause a marked displacement of the lower fragment upwards, since the ends of the injured bone can be easily made to slide upon each other and therefore no obstacle to muscular contraction will exist. B. MUSCLES SITUATED UPON THE ARM. The four muscles situated upon the arm may be divided into two groups: (1) Those attached to the anterior surface of the hu- j Biceps flexor cubiti. merus (2) ( Brachialis anticus. (2) Those attached to the posterior surface of the hu- (Triceps extensor cubiti merus (2) (Subanconeus. ORIGIN AND INSERTION. Biceps Flexor Cubiti. Origin. Short head. From the tip of the coracoid process of the scapula in common with the coraco-brachialis muscle. Long head. 1. From the top of the glenoid cavity of the scapula. 2. From the glenoid ligament of the shoulder joint. Insertion. Into the posterior aspect of the bicipital tuberosity of the radius. Nervous supply. The musculo-cutaneous nerve. Brachialis Anticus. Origin. * 1. From the lower half of both the inner and outei surfaces of the shaft of the humerus.

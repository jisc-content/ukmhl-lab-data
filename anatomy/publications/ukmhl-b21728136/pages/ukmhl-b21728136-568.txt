540 ORGAN OF PHONA TION. Action. By tilting the thyroid cartilage forwards, it elong- ates and tightens the vocal cords, T hyro-Arytenoid. Origin. From the lower part of the receding angle of the thyroid cartilage, and the posterior surface of the crico-thyroid membrane. Insertion. Into the anterior surface, and the internal angle of the base of the arytenoid cartilage. Nervous supply. The recurrent laryngeal nerve. Action. By drawing the arytenoid cartilage forwards, it shortens and relaxes the vocal cords. Crico-Arytenoid Lateralis. Origin. From the side and upper border of the cricoid car- tilage. Insertion. Into the external or posterior angle of the arytenoid cartilage. Nervous supply. The recurrent laryngeal nerve. Action. By rotating the arytenoid cartilages, it approximates the anterior angles of these cartilages, and thus closes the opening of the glottis. Crico-Arytenoid Posticus. Origin. From the posterior surface of the cricoid cartilage. Insertion. Into the external or posterior angle of the aryten- oid cartilage. Nervous supply. The recurrent laryngeal nerve. Action. By rotating the arytenoid cartilages, it separates the anterior angles of those cartilages, and thus opens the glottis.

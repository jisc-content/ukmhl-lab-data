ARTERIES OF THE THORAX. 401 a little lower than the other. Each vessel is directed to the back part of the corresponding bronchus, along which they run, divid- ing and subdividing, upon the bronchial tubes ; and supplying them, the cellular tissue of the lungs, the bronchial glands, and the oesophagus. The oesophageal branches are usually four or five in number and are given off from the anterior aspect of the aorta. The posterior mediastinal branches are distributed to the glands and the cellular tissue of the mediastinum. The aortic intercostal arteries are usually ten in number upon each side and are given oft' from the back of the aorta. Each in- tercostal artery divides into an anterior and a posterior branch. The anterior branch or proper intercostal branch divides be- tween the two intercostal muscles into branches, which supply the ribs. The posterior or dorsal branch divides into spinal branches, which enter the intervertebral foramina and are distributed to the spinal cord and its membranes ; and muscular branches which are distributed to the deep muscles of the back. ABDOMINAL AORTA. The abdominal aorta extends from the aortic opening, in front of the 12th dorsal vertebra, to the body of the 4th lumbar verte- bra, where it bifurcates into the two common iliac arteries. In its course, it curves slightly backwards and towards the left side. Its greatest convexity corresponds to the 3d lumbar verte- bra. It is about four inches in length.

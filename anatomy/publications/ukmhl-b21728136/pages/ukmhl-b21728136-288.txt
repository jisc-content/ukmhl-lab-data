There are 62 pairs of muscles connected with the skeleton of the upper extremity, They may be thus divided : I. Extrinsic Muscles, 12 II. Intrinsic “ 50 Total 62 muscles. By an extrinsic muscle is meant a muscle which serves to con- nect the upper extremity to some other part of the skeleton. By an intrinsic muscle, is meant one which serves to connect the various segments of the extremity with each other. 1. EXTRINSIC MUSCLES OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY. The twelve pairs of muscles connected with the two upper extremities, may be divided into three distinct sets. (1) Those connecting the upper extremity to the head. (2) Those connecting the upper extremity to the back of the trunk. (3) Those connecting the upper extremity to the anterior and lateral walls of the trunk. The various muscles included under each of these groups will be shown in the following table. ♦

ORGAN OF BEARING. 588 The neck affords attachment to the laxator tympani mus- cle. The manubrium or handle of the malleus is inserted into a space between the mucous and fibrous layers of the membrana tympani. The processus gracilis is an extremely long and delicate pro- jection, which extends forwards and outwards into the fissure of Glaser. The processus brevis of the bone projects, from the root of the manubrium, outwards towards the upper portion of the membrana tympani, and affords attachment to the tensor tympani muscle. The INCUS, so-called from its resemblance to an anvil, although it is perhaps more like a bicuspid tooth with its roots widely sep- arated, is the central bone of the cavity of the tympanum and articulates with the malleus and the stapes. It presents the fol- lowing points of interest: A body. A long process. The os orbiculare. A short process. The body articulates with the malleus, and is connected to the roof of the tympanum by a suspensory ligament. The long process lies nearly parallel with the manubrium of the malleus, and terminates in nodule of bone termed the “ os orbiculare.” The os orbiculare is sometimes described as the fourth bone of the tympanum, since it is separate from the incus in the foetus. It articulates with the head of the stapes. The short process is attached to the posterior wall of the tym- panum by the posterior ligament. The STAPES is the most internal bone of the tympanum and is so-called from its resemblance to a stirrup. It articulates with the os orbiculare of the incus, and is attached to the annular lig- ament around the edge of the fenestra ovalis. It presents the following points of interest : A head. A neck. Two crura. A base. The head articulates with the long process of the incus through the os orbiculare. The neck is the constricted portion below the head. It affords attachment to the stapedius muscle.

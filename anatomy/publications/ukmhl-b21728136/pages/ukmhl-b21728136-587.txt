THE URETER. 559 8. Uriniferous plexuses. 9. Stars of Verheyen, (venous plexuses). 10. Ascending and descending veins. 11. Venous arcades, (over bases of pyramids). 12. Primary veins. 12. Renal vein. The NERVES of the kidney are derived from the renal plexus and from,the lesser splanchnic nerve. The LYMPHATICS comprise a superficial and a deep set, and open into the lumbar glands. THE URETER. The ureter is the excretory duct of the kidney, and, by its upper or expanded portion, it forms the internal cavity of that organ. The pelvis of the kidney, which is but another name for the upper end of the ureter, may be subdivided into the following portions: The pelvis proper. The infundibula. The calices. The infundibula are large prolongations, usually three in num- ber, from the main cavity of the pelvis. The calices are smaller prolongations from the three infundi- bula, which vary from seven to thirteen in number, and which embrace the papillae of the kidney. They serve to collect the urine as it escapes from the small openings of the straight tubes of that organ, and to convey it to the ureter. The ureter is from sixteen to eighteen inches in length, and is of the diameter of an ordinary quill. As it passes downward to open into the bladder, near to its base, it bears an important sur- gical relation to the common iliac artery, to which vessel, in cases where its ligation is demanded, it is often used as a guide. The ureter, in all of its portions, has three coats, to which the names fibrous, muscular, and mucous coats are applied. The epithelium of the mucous coat is spheroidal in character and differs from that of the urethra, bladder, or the uriniferous tubes. This is an anatomical point of practical value, since, in cases of inflammatory diseases of the genito-urinary tract, the variety of epithelium detected in the urine is of great value in deciding upon the locality of the disease.

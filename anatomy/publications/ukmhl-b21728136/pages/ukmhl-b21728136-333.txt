MUSCLES OF LOWER EXTREMITY. 3â€œ Nervous supply. The great sciatic nerve. Semi-Tendinosus. Origin. In common with the long head of the biceps flexor cruris, from the inner and lower part of the posterior surface of the tuberosity of the ischium. Insertion. Into the upper part of the inner surface of the shaft of the tibia, beneath the sartorius and below the gracilis muscle. Nervous supply. The great sciatic nerve. Semi-Membranosus. Origin. 1. From the upper and outer part of the posterior surface of the tuberosity of the ischium. 2. From the outer side of the point of origin of the biceps and semitendinosus. Insertion. 1. Into the posterior part of the inner tuberosity of the tibia. 2. Into a groove on the inner tuberosity of the tibia (this slip passing under the internal lateral liga- ment of the knee). 3. Into the posterior and outer part of the condyle of the femur, thus strengthening the posterior liga- ment of the knee-joint. Nervous supply. The great sciatic nerve. ACTION OF MUSCLES OF THE FEMORAL REGION UPON THE HIP JOINT. The motions of the hip joint may be enumerated as follows : Flexion. Extension. Adduction. Abduction. External rotation. Internal rotation. The muscles of the femoral region producing these various

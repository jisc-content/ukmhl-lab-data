66 THE SKULL IN GENERAL. the points of interest and importance which are met with in the cavity of the orbit, a simple enumeration of them being sufficient. Muscles of the Orbit. Within the orbital cavity arise the following eight muscles: (i.) The External Rectus. (2.) The Internal Rectus. (3.) The Superior Rectus. (4.) The Inferior Rectus. (5.) The Superior Oblique. (6.) The Inferior Oblique. (7.) The Levator palpebrae. (8.) The Tensor tarsi. Foramina of the Orbit. Each orbit has nine foramina, communicating with it, which may be thus enumerated : ’Opening into the cranium.., The Orbit 1 pre s e n t s nine fora-, mina, as follows: Opening into the face • • • (3) | ...(iM Opening into the nose -Opening into the zygomatic fossa.(f)\ Optic foramen. Sphenoidal fissure. Anterior fronto-ethmoidal canal. Posterior fronto-ethmoidal canal. Supra-orbital foramen. Infra-orbital foramen. Malar foramen. Nasal duct. Spheno-maxillary fissure. Total, 9 The supra-orbital foramen may be felt at the point of junction of the middle and the inner thirds of the supra-orbital margin, and a line drawn from that point to the interval between the bicuspid teeth of the upper and the lower jaws will cross the infra-orbital and the mental foramina. This is a valuable guide to these fora- mina, in case the division of any of the three branches of the fifth cranial nerve be demanded. The pulley of the superior oblique muscle may be felt by pres- sure being applied at the internal angular process of the frontal bone, and, in operations about the orbit, this process should be carefully avoided. The Nasal Fossae. The cavity of the nose is divided into two fossae, by a vertical septum situated in the median line of the face. Each nasal fossa is a narrow, irregularly shaped cavity, en- closed between the orbits, the superior maxillary bone, and the vertical septum, and, from below upwards, between the roof of the mouth and the anterior portion of the base of the skull.

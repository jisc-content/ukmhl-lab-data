In this table, the formation of the lumbar plexus is shown, as well as the branches which are given off from each nerve which assists to form it. It will be perceived that three important nerves, viz., the anterior crural, the obturator, and accessory obturator nerves, are formed by branches both of the 3d and 4th lumbar nerves, and therefore may be said to arise by two heads. The accessory obtu- rator nerve, however, arises occasionally by a branch derived only from the 4th lumbar nerve; its other head being a branch given off from the obturator nerve.

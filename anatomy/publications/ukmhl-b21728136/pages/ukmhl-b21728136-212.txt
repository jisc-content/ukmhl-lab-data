I90 ARTHROLOGY OR SYNDESMOLOGY. THE KNEE JOINT. The femoro-tibial articulation or knee joint, is a ginglymus or hinge-joint. Three bones enter into its formation, namely, the lower articu- lar surfaces of the femur, the upper articular surfaces of the tibia, and the posterior surface of the patella. The ligaments may be divided into two sets, as follows: 1st. A peripheral or external set. (Extra capsular.) 2nd. A deep or internal set. (Intra capsular.) Under the peripheral or external set are embraced the follow- ing ligaments : The anterior ligament. , The posterior ligament. The internal lateral ligament. The external lateral ligament. The capsular ligament. Under the deep or internal set the following ligaments are included: The internal semilunar fibro-cartilage. The external semilunar fibro-cartilage. The transverse ligament. The anterior crucial ligament. The posterior crucial ligament. By some anatomists, two more ligaments called the ligamentum mucosum and the ligamenta alaria, are described as belonging to the internal set, but they have been here excluded, since they are more properly considered as reflections of the synovial membranes of the joint. The anterior ligament, or ligamentum patella, is a continua- tion of the tendon of the rectus femoi;is muscle. It extends from the apex of the patella to the lower part of the tubercle of the tibia. It is separated from the synovial membrane of the knee joint by a mass of adipose tissue, and from the upper part of the tibia by a small bursa. The posterior ligament of the knee joint, called the ligamentum posticum Winslowii is partly derived from, and strength- ened by, the tendon of the semimembranosus muscle, It extends from the inner tuberosity of the tibia to the upper and back part of the outer condyle of the femur. Cruveilhier describes two additional lateral portions of this ligament, closely connected with the tendons

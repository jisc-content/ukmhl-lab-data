PARIETAL BONE. 43 THE PARIETAL BONE. This bone forms the side of the skull and is so named from (pariesâ€”a wall). It is quadrilateral in form and presents for ex- amination two surfaces, four borders, and four angles. Surfaces. The exterior or outer surface is convex and presents three points deserving of special mention. (i.) The parietal foramen, which is situated at the upper and posterior portion of the bone and which transmits a vein to the superior longitudinal sinus. (2.) A prominent portion of bone termed thz parietal eminence. (3.) The temporal ridge, which indicates the upper boundary of the temporal fossa of the skull. The interior surface of the bone is concave and presents four points of special interest, as follows: (1.) Cerebral eminences and depressions, which correspond to the cerebral convolutions. (2.) Furrows in the bone, in which are lodged the ramifications of the middle meningeal artery. (3.) A half groove near the superior border of the bone, for the superior longitudinal sinus of the skull, and for the attachment of the falx cerebri. (4.) Depressions for the Pacchionian bodies, which are small, whitish bodies situated between the dura mater and the skull. Borders. The superior border of the bone forms, by its junction with the parietal bone of the opposite side, the sagittal suture. The inferior border is bevelled on its outer surface, and is over- lapped, in front, by the greater wing of the sphenoid bone and by the squamous portion of the temporal bone, while, behind, it articulates with the mastoid portion of the temporal bone. The anterior border of the bone is serrated and forms the coronal suture by its articulation with the frontal bone. The posterior border of the bone articulates with the occipital bone and thus forms the lambdoidal suture. Angles. The anterior superior and the posterior superior angles of the

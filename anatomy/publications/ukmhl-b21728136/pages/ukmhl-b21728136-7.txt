PREFACE. It may seem to the members of the medical profession, a needless task to present another work upon Anatomy, when so many exhaustive treatises already exist; and the criticism is one in which the Authors of this volume might justly coincide were the present work intended to supercede or rival the works of such famous authors as Quain, Gray, Ellis, Sappey, Hyrtl, Holden, Wilson, Heath, Bellamy, and others who have merited enduring reputation. It is to be hoped, however, that the public will agree with the Authors of this volume in the feeling that the more exhaust- ive treatises, in all their completeness of detail, often compel the student, in the beginning of his studies, to waste much valuable time in culling, from the voluminous mass of matter before him, such points as seem to him essential, and that, too often, these selections are not made with the judgment which the enlighten- ment of continued study and a higher degree of culture would afford. The present state of advanced science and the practical bear- ing which minute anatomical points and microscopical discoveries in histology are assuming, all tend, possibly too often, to lead anatomical instructors to forget that the medical student must creep before he can walk, and that by a thorough comprehension of those anatomical facts which are comprised in gross anatomy only, can he either appreciate or properly value the higher grades of anatomical investigation. It is, at present, too common with critics to stamp with their opprobrium all works which are not diffuse in character, and to stigmatize, as “ cram books,” any which show an attempt to sim- plify, condense, and rearrange facts hitherto well known ; and to refer their readers to treatises whose exhaustiveness alone per- haps* requires the very preparatory drill which a smaller volume of well-culled facts would best afford them. In this volume will be found, what, in the opinion of the authors at least, are some, perhaps not all, of the essentials of human anatomy. It has been the endeavor of the Authors to so arrange these anatomical facts as to render their comprehension easy, even to

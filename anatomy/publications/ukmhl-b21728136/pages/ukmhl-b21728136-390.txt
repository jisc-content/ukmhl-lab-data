ANGIOLOGY. 368 This space contains the following structures: f Internal carotid. External carotid. | Facial. I Posterior auricular. Temporal, f Internal maxillary. 7 Veins... -{ Temporal. Internal maxillary. I Temporo maxillary, t Posterior auricular. f Facial. I Pneumogastric. 5 Nerves.. S Mylo hyoid. | Glosso-pharyngeal. t Superficial cervical. In the front portion of this space, the submaxillary gland contains, embedded within a groove on its surface, the facial artery and vein; and, beneath this gland, lie the submental artery and the mylo-hyoid artery and nerve. The posterior portion of this triangle is separated from the anterior portion by the stylo-maxillary ligament. Within this portion of the triangle lies the external carotid artery, deeply im- bedded within the parotid gland. This vessel here lies in front of, and superficial to, the internal carotid artery. In this situa- tion, the facial nerve crosses the internal carotid and sends some of its filaments in company with the superficial cervical nerve to ramify beneath the platysma muscle. Within the substance of the parotid gland, the external carotid artery also gives off the posterior auricular branch and divides into its two terminal branches, the temporal and internal maxillary vessels. The internal carotid artery is more deeply situated than the external carotid and is separated from it, in this triangle, by the stylo-glossus and the stylo-pharyngeus muscles and also by the glosso-pharyngeal nerve. It is accompanied by the internal jugular vein and the pneumogastric nerve, the vein lying to the outside of the internal carotid artery. The veins mentioned in the table of contents of the sub- maxillary triangle correspond, in most instances, to the arteries also contained, although a few of the superficial veins of this

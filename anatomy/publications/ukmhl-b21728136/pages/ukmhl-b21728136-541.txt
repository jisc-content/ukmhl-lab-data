513 THE PERICARDIUM. The internal or serous layer of the percardium forms a sheath for the aorta and the pulmonary artery for the first two inches of their extent; and is then reflected upon the venae cavae, the pul- monary veins, the external surface of the heart, and subsequently upon the inner surface of the fibrous layer. The fibrous layer of the pericardium is prolonged upwards upon the great vessels of the neck, and becomes continuous with the deep layer of the cervical fascia.

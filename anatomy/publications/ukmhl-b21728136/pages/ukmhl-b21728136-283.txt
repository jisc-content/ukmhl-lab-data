MUSCLES OF THE PERINEUM, 26l Insertion. This muscle invests the bulb of the urethra, and, at its anterior part, sends a slip to enclose the corpora cavernosa of the penis. Nervous supply. The perineal nerve. Transversus Perin^ei. Origin, From the inner surface and anterior part of the tu- berosity of the ischium. Insertion, Into the central tendinous point of the perineum, joining with its fellow of the opposite side, and with the sphincter ani and accelerator urinae muscles. Nervous supply. The perineal nerve. This muscle, in connection with the two muscles named above* assists to form a triangular space, which is of surgical importance, from the relation of the vessels and nerves contained within it, in the operation of lithotomy. This triangle is bounded, externally, by the erector penis; in- ternally, by the accelerator urinae ; and, posteriorly, by the trans- versus perinaei. The contents of this triangular space will be found described in detail in the closing pages of this work, descriptive of the perineum. Compressor Urethrae. Origin, From the upper part of the ramus of the pubes. Insertion. This muscle, after encircling the membranous por- tion of the urethra, unites with its fellow of the oppo- site side on the upper and lower surface of that tube. Nervous supply. The perineal nerve and sometimes by a direct branch of the pudic nerve. Levator Ani. Origin. 1. Anteriorly, from the posterior surface of the body and the ramus of the pubes. 2. Posteriorly, from the inner surface of the spine of the ischium.

NEUROLOGY. 440 The arachnoid is, like all serous membranes, a shut sac which serves the purpose of lubrication and which invests the cerebro- spinal axis. The surface which invests the organs is called the visceral layer, while the surface which lines the dura mater is called the parietal layer. Between the visceral layer of the arachnoid and the pia mater, a cavity exists called the subarachnoidean space, which usually communicates with the general ventricular cavity in the brain substance, through an opening in the floor of the 4th ven- tricle. This space is most extensively developed at the base of the brain and around the spinal cord. It contains the cerebro- ' spinal fluid. The pia mater is a delicate vascular membrane which invests the brain and spinal cord, and whose function is that of nutrition. It is everywhere intimately adherent to the nerve substance, and, at the transverse fissure of the brain, it penetrates into the ven- tricular cavities of that organ and forms the choroid plexuses and the velum interpositum. The pia mater of the spinal cord differs from that which in- vests the brain, in being thicker, less vascular, and in forming a series of ligaments, called the ligamenta denticulata, which unite the sides of the cord to the dura mater, and thus support it and protect it from injury.

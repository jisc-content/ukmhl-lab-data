The recurrent laryngeal nerve, so called because it winds around the subclavian artery upon the right side, and, upon the left side, around the aorta, before it ascends to the larynx, is the great nerve of phonation. It is said to consist principally of fibres derived from the spinal accessory nerve, which have simply used the sheath of the pneumogastric nerve for protection, during their course through the neck. The SPINAL ACCESSORY nerve, by its branches of communica- tion with the pneumogastric nerve, as above mentioned, gives origin, through fibres derived from its accessory portion, to the two nerves of phonation. The fibres derived from its spinal por- tion are mostly distributed to muscles and the cervical nerves of the upper portion of the neck. This nerve has been often called the â€œ superior respiratory nerve of Bell," since it affords the motor power to the muscles which open the glottis, previous to each inspiration, and thus it allows air to enter the lung without impediment. The HYPOGLOSSAL nerve gives off only one branch which possesses any surgical interest, viz., the descendens noni nerve, which descends in front of the sheath of the common carotid artery, and communicates with the communicans noni nerve, a branch derived from the cervical plexus.

1^6 BONES OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY. supinator brevis, the extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis, the extensor secundi internodii pollicis, and the exten- sor indicis. The internal surface is subcutaneous in its lower fourth, and, in its upper three-fourths, it affords attach- ment to the flexor profundus digitorum muscle. Muscles Attached. The ulna affords attachment to thirteen muscles, which may- be found classified below. f To olecranon process (i)-{ Triceps extensor cubiti.

Occasionally the flexor longus pollicis is attached to the ulna. Articulation. The ulna articulates with two bones, namely, the humerus and the radius. Development. The ulna is developed by three centres of ossification: one for the shaft of the bone, one for the inferior extremity and one for the olecranon process. In the shaft of the bone, ossification com- mences, at about its centre, during the fifth week of foetal life and rapidly extends through its greater portion. At birth, the ends of the ulna are cartilaginous. At the fourth year of age, a separate osseous nucleus makes its appearance in the centre of the head of the ulna and from this point ossification rapidly ex- tends into the styloid process. The olecranon process does not begin to ossify until about the tenth year of age, when the shaft of the bone shows a tendency to extension into it. At about the sixteenth year of age, the upper epiphysis of the bone becomes fully joined to the shaft, but the lower one does not become united until about the twentieth year.

MYOLOGY. 26o D. MUSCLES OF THE PERINEUM. The muscles of the perineum, in the male, may be thus enum- erated. Erector Penis. Accelerator Urin^e. Transversus Perin^ei. Compressor Urethrae. Sphincter Ani. Levator Ani. Coccygeus. In the female, the erector penis becomes the erector clitoridis, the accelerator urinse is absent, and the sphincter vaginae is added ; so that the same total of muscle is preserved. The anterior fibres of the levator ani muscle, in the male, con- sist of a distinct band which descends along the sides of the prostate gland and encircles it like a sling. This portion was pictured by Santorini as a separate muscle, and the name levator prostatce muscle has been, by many later anatomists, ascribed to it. It seems justly to lay claim to a special name, since it performs, in the male sex, a most important part in the act of micturition. ORIGIN AND INSERTION. Erector Penis. Origin. 1. From the inner surface of the tuberosity of the ischium, behind the extremity of the crus-penis. 2. From the surface of the crus-penis. 3. From the adjacent portion of ramus of the pubes. Insertion. Into the sides and the under surface of the crus- penis. Nervous supply. The perineal nerve. Accelerator Urin^e. This muscle consists of two symmetrical halves united, in the median line, by a tendinous raphe. Origin. 1. From the central tendon of the perineum. 2. From the median raphe.

SUMMARY OF CRANIAL NERVES. 469 SUMMARY OF THE CRANIAL NERVES. The cranial nerves may be subdivided, according to the pe- culiar function of each, into four groups, which may be enum- erated as follows: A. Nerves of Special Sense. Olfactory (smell). Optic (sight). Auditory (hearing). Part of glosso-pharyn^eal. ) Tagte Gustatory branch of fifth ? ) B. Nerves of Motion. Motor oculi. Patheticus or trQchlearis. Part of third division of 5 th. Abducens or 6th nerve. Facial. Spinal accessory. Hypoglossal. C. Nerves of Common Sensation. Fifth (greater portion). Part of glosso-pharyngeal. D. Mixed Nerves. Pneumogastric. All of the cranial nerves possess what is called a superficial and a deep point of origin from the substance of the brain; and all escape from one or more of the cranial foramina. In the preceding tables, both the points of origin and the foramina of escape have been omitted, since the first can best be memorized by arranging the point of origin of the twelve sepa- rate nerves together, and since the latter has already been fully given in a preceding table of the foramina of the skull and the parts contained in each, which will be found in the closing pages, descriptive of the skull in general. The deep points of origin of the cranial nerves will not be given in this work, since they are, at present, too much matters of dispute to allow of any positive or absolute statement.

MYOLOGY. 256 Nervous supply. The external posterior branches of the cervical nerves. Spinalis Dorsi. Origin. From the spinous processes of the two upper lumbar and the two lower dorsal vertebrae. Insertion. Into the spinous processes of from four to eight of the middle and upper dorsal vertebrae. Nervous supply. External posterior branches of the dorsal nerves. Longissimus Dorsi. Origin. From the inner and largest division of the erector spinae muscle. Insertion. A. {Inner set). 1. By separate slips into the trans- verse processes of all the dorsal vertebrae. 2. Into the tubercles (maxillary), on the back of the superior articular processes of the lumbar vertebrae. B. (Outer set). 1. Into the posterior surfaces of transverse processes of lumbar vertebrae. 2. Into the nine lower ribs internally to their angles. Nervous supply. External posterior branches of the dorsal nerves. Sacro-Lumbalis. Origin. A division of the erector spinae muscle. Insertion. By distinct tendons, into the angles of the upper six ribs. Nervous supply. External posterior branches of the lumbar nerves. Erector SpiNiE. Origin. 1. From the posterior iliac spines. 2.

417 DORSALIS PEDIS ARTERY. outer border of the tibialis anticus muscle, and, if this muscle be put in action, a guide to the incision necessary to ligate this ves- sel will be afforded. Branches. The anterior tibial gives off three branches as follows. f Recurrent tibial, Anterior Tibial Artery. I Muscular branches. (3 branches.) j Malleolar., j â€œ The recurrent tibial branch is distributed to the front of the knee. The muscular branches supply the muscles upon either side of the artery. The malleolar branches are two in number and pass beneath the tendons at the inner and outer sides of the ankle, to anasto- mose with the posterior tibial, the internal plantar, the peroneal and the tarsal arteries. DORSALIS PEDIS ARTERY. This artery extends, as a continuation of the anterior tibial, from the bend of the ankle, along the tibial side of the foot, to the back part of the 'first interosseous space, where it divides into two branches, viz., the dorsalis hallucis and the communicating. This artery has the anterior tibial nerve on its outer side. The course of dorsalis pedis artery may be described upon the surface of the dorsum of the foot by a line drawn from the cen- tral point in front of the ankle, to the space between the 1st and 2d metatarsal bone. Branches. The dorsalis pedis artery gives off five branches as follows. Dorsalis Pedis Artery. (5 branches,) f Tarsal. 1 Metatarsal. -{ 3rd, 4th and 5th interosseous. ^ Dorsal artery of great toe (ist interosseous). Communicating. Interosseous. The tarsal branches anastomose with the metatarsal, external malleolar and external plantar arteries. The metatarsal branch gives off the three outer dorsal inteross- eous arteries, which are joined by the anterior and posterior per- forating arteries, and which supply digital branches to the dorsum of three and a half toes on the outer side of the foot. The dorsal artery of the great toe corresponds to a first dor-

Gluteus medius (anterior half) m (sU <4>il l (H) Of these muscles the two principal flexors lie in front of the hip joint and are inserted into the lesser trochanter of the femur. The six external rotators lie behind the hip joint and are in- serted into the great trochanter of the femur, excepting one, viz., the obturator externus.

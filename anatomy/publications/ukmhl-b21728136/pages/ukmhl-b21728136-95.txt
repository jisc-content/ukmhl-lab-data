7 3 BASE OF THE SKULL. This fossa has three fissures which terminate in it, viz., the sphenoidal, the spheno-maxillary, and the pterygo-maxillary fissures. It communicates also with three fossce and two cavities, which may be thus enumerated : The three fossae are : The two cavities are : (Orbit. ■j Nasal cavity. (Zygomatic, j Cranial. \ Buccal. It has five foramina which open into it, viz.: Foramen of the Spheno- maxillary fossa.... 'On the posterior wall. (3) On the inner wall ... (1) _ At the lower portion.. (1) {Foramen rotundum. Vidian canal. Pterygo-palatine canal. *{ Spheno-palatine foramen, j Superior orifice of the poster- ( ior palatine canal. Of these, the foramen rotundum opens into the cranium, the vidian canal opens into the foramen basis cranii, the spheno-pala- tine foramen opens into the nasal fossa, the posterior palatine canal opens into the roof of the mouth, and the pterygo-palatine canal opens into the upper portion of the pharynx. Occasionally accessory palatine foramina are present at the lower portion of this fossa, in addition to the opening of the pos- terior palatine canal. THE UNDER SURFACE OF THE BASE OF THE • SKULL. The under surface of the skull is bounded from before back- ward by the following bony margins: [In front by the.... \ Alveolar arch and the teeth of the J J ( upper jaw. The Base of the Skull is bounded as follows Laterally by the.... I Behind by the f Lower border of the Malar bone. J Zygomatic arch. ] Imaginary line from the zygoma to the mastoid process, j Superior curved line of the Occipital / bone. From before backwards, the base of the skull may be said to consist of five distinct regions. A. The roof of the mouth. B. The posterior aperture of the nasal cavity. C. The under surface of the basilar process. D. A quadrangular space on either side of the basilar process. E. The under surface of the occipital bone.

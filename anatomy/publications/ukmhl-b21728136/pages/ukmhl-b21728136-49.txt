SPHENOID BONE. 27 cranial nerves; viz., 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th, and other struc- tures, as enumerated in the table of cranial foramina. These foramina may be thus classified: The sphenoid bone has | 5 Simple foramina, 6 pairs of openings, viz.: Optic foramen. Foramen rotundm. “ ovale, “ Vesalii. “ Spinosum. 1 Fissure, ■{ Sphenoidal fissure. Each of these foramina has been alluded to in the descrip- tions of the various parts of the sphenoid bone. They will fur- thermore be found considered separately and in detail in “ the classified table of foramina situated at the base of the skull.” The sphenoid bone transmits two important arteries ; viz., the ophthalmic and the middle meningeal arteries, and contains one canal, called the Vidian canal, which transmits the Vidian nerve. Muscles attached to the Sphenoid Bone. The sphenoid bone affords attachment to twelve pairs of muscles. These muscles may be thus classified : Muscles attached to Sphenoid Bone. the 'All the muscles of the Or- bit excepting the In- (7) erior oblique muscle. f Levator palpebrae.

These ten centres are distributed as follows: For the posterior half of the Bone. Centres of Ossifi- cation of the . Sphenoid Bone, For the anterior half of the bone.

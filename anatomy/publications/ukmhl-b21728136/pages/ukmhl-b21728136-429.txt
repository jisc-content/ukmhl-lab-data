EXTERNAL ILIA C AR TER Y. 407 1. The anastomoses of the hemorrhoidal branches of the in- ternal iliac with the superior hemorrhoidal branch of the inferior mesenteric. 2. The anastomoses of the uterine and ovarian arteries, and of the vesical arteries of opposite sides. 3. The lateral sacral with the middle sacral artery ; 4. The epigastric artery with the internal mammary, inferior intercostal and lumbar arteries ; 5. The ilio-lumbar with the last lumbar artery. 6. The obturator artery, by means of its pubic branch, with the vessel of the opposite side, and with the internal epigastric. 7. The gluteal with the posterior branches of the sacral ar- teries. EXTERNAL ILIAC ARTERY. This artery extends from the bifurcation of the common iliac artery, opposite to the sacro-iliac synchondrosis, to beneath Pou- part's ligameut midway between the anterior superior spine of the ilium and the symphysis pubis, where it becomes the femoral artery. In adult life, the external iliac artery is somewhat larger than the internal iliac, although, in the foetus, it is usually much smaller. It has the following relations within the pelvis.

The epigastric artery is larger than its accompanying branch, and arises near to Poupart s ligament, from the front of the ex-

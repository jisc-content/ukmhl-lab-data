These plans of relations show, in detail, the following ana- tomical facts worthy of memory. 1. The axillary vein lies internal to the artery in each of its three portions. 2. The brachial plexus of nerves lies to the outer side of the first portion, surrounds the second portion with its three cords, and surrounds the third portion with its terminal branches. 3. The pectoralis major muscle covers the entire artery on its anterior aspect. 4. The pectoralis minor muscle bears relation only to the second portion of the vessel. 5. The cephalic vein, which joins the axillary vein at the level of the lower margin of the deltoid muscle, is in relation only with the jirst portion of the axillary artery. In the plan of relations of each of the three portions of the axillary artery, the individual mention of the integument and the fascia which invests the structures covering each and every portion of the vessel, have been omitted ; since they must of necessity be understood to exist and since they possess no special interest. THE AXILLARY SPACE. The axilla or the axillary space, through which the axillary artery passes, is pyramidal in form, its apex being above and its base corresponding to the integument and fascia which binds the arm to the side of the trunk.

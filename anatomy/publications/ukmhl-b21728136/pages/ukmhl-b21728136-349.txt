32 7 MUSCLES OF LOWER EXTREMITY. GENERAL ACTION OF THE MUSCLES OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY. The flexor and extensor muscles are arranged alternately on opposite sides of the limbs. Hence it follows that when a muscle of the lower extremity passes over any two of the four principal joints, it flexes the one and extends the other or vice versa. To the above rule there are only two exceptions. 1st. The sartorius muscle, which produces flexion of two joints. 2d. The gracilis muscle, which flexes the knee and adducts the limb, when it is extended. The motions of the four principal joints of the lower extrem- ity are thus named: Nomenclature of the Motions of . Extremity. the Lower Joints. If moved If moved forwards. backwards. Hip. Flexion.

The three different forms of levers are beautifully represented in the foot. The first order of levers, viz., where the fulcrum is in the centre, is exhibited by tapping the floor with the toes. —♦ Toes. In this case, the ankle becomes the fulcrum (F), the muscles attached to the heel the power (P), the foot the resistance (R), to be overcome. The second order of levers where the resistance to be overcome Muscles. P F Heel.

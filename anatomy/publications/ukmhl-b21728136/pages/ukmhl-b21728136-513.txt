489 SUMMARY OF LUMBAR NERVES. SUMMARY OF THE NERVES OF THE LUMBAR REGION. In the preceding tables, which illustrate the distribution of the nerves of the lumbar region, it will be perceived that the posterior divisions of the lumbar nerves are of little importance as compared with the anterior divisions. The LUMBAR PLEXUS of nerves is formed from the anterior division of the first four lumbar nerves, each one of which nerves gives off, in addition to a communicating branch, some special branches of its own, which are included among the various branches of the lumbar plexus. This plexus is situated in the substance of the psoas magnus muscle. The ANTERIOR CRURAL NERVE arises by two heads from the 3rd and 4th lumbar nerves. It bears an important relation, in Scarpa’s space, with the femoral artery and its accompanying vein ; since all three pass underneath Poupart’s ligament. It sends an articular branch to the knee-joint. The OBTURATOR NERVE arises by two heads, derived respec- tively from the 3rd and 4th lumbar nerves, and, after its exit from the pelvis, bears an intimate relation with the capsular ligament of the hip-joint, to which joint, as well as to the knee, it sends articular filaments. It is on account of this nerve, whose distri- bution to two joints has been mentioned, that disease of the hip- joint frequently manifests itself, in its early stages, by pain within the knee. The accessory obturator nerve, if it exists, usually arises by two heads derived from the 4th lumbar and the obturator nerves. It sends a filament to the hip-joint.

BONES OF THE HEAD. 44 parietal bone correspond to the anterior and the posterior fon- tanelles. The anterior inferior angle is received between the frontal bone and great wing of the sphenoid bone, one inch above and behind the superior external angle of the orbit. Internally, it is often grooved for the anterior branch of the middle meningeal artery. The posterior inferior angle articulates with the mastoid por- tion of the temporal bone and presents, internally, a small portion of the groove for the lateral sinus. Muscles. The parietal bone affords attachment to only one muscle; viz., the temporal muscle. Articulations of the Parietal Bone. This bone articulates with five bones, which may be thus enu- merated : The Parietal Bone ar- ticulates with 5 bones, as- follows: Mesial bones. Lateral bones ) Occipital. Sphenoid. Frontal. 2 ( Temporal \ Opposite Parietal. 5 Both parietal bones articulate also with only five bones as follows. The three mesial bones above mentioned and the two temporal. Since the two parietal bones meet in the median line the parietal articulation common to each one separately is want- ing when both are considered together. Development. The parietal bone is developed from only one centre of ossifi- cation, which corresponds with the parietal eminence.

Total, ‘5 Both of the temporal bones, however, articulate with only- seven bones ; viz., the three mesial bones, (occipital, sphenoid and inferior maxilla) and two pairs of bones (parietal and malar). Development of the Temporal Bone. The temporal bone is developed by four centres, exclusive of those of the internal ear and its ossicula. These four primary centres of ossification are arranged as follows : ” One for the The four centres of de- velopment of the Tem- J One for the poral Bone are as fol-' lows : One for the One for the ) Squamous portion and the Zygomatic portion. Auditory process. {Petrous portion and the Mastoid portion. -{ Styloid process. At birth this bone consists of three pieces, as indicated above, (excluding the styloid process). During the first year these three portions become united, the auditory process joining the petrous portion of the bone soon after birth. The styloid process does not become united, however, until the 2nd or 3rd year of age.

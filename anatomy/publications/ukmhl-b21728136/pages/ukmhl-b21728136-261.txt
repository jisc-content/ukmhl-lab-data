MUSCLES OF THE ABDOM*EN. 239 The abdominal muscles also assist greatly in drawing the pel- vis upwards, when the thorax becomes a fixed point, as is illus- trated in the act of climbing. The recti muscles are depressors of the thorax and serve to flex the spinal column, if the pelvis be fixed; or, if the thorax be made the point of resistance, the pelvis may, by these muscles, be flexed upon the vertebral column. The pyramidalis muscle, though often wanting, tends, when present, to act as a tensor of the linea alba. NERVOUS SUPPLY OF THE ABDOMINAL MUSCLES. Name of Nerve. Name of Muscle. Group.

As the abdominal walls demand a. great power of resistance to internal pressure, we find the muscular layers arranged so as to prevent a possible separation of the various fibres, which would afford an opportunity for protrusion of viscera. The fibres of each of the abdominal muscles are therefore directed differently, as is shown in the following: External oblique muscle downwards and inwards. Internal oblique muscle *. upwards and inwards. Transversalis abdominis muscle horizontally. Rectus abdominis muscle upwards. Pyramidalis muscle. upwards. POINTS OF SURGICAL INTEREST PERTAINING TO THE ABDOMINAL MUSCLES. The aponeurotic tendon of the internal oblique muscle of the abdomen deserves special notice. At the outer margin of the rectus abdominis muscle, this aponeurosis, for the upper three fourths of its extent, splits into two lamellae, one of which passes in front and the other behind the

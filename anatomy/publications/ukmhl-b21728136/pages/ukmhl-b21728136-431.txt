409 INTERNAL ILIAC ARTERY. PLAN OF THE RELATIONS OF THE INTERNAL ILIAC ARTERY. Outer side. Psoas magnus. In front. Peritoneum. Ureter. Internal iliac vein. Lumbo-sacral nerve. Pyriformis muscle. Branches. The internal iliac artery, through its two divisions, gives off twelve branches. These branches have been also divided into two sets, termed the visceral and the non-visceral branches. The former set include the first six branches arising from the anterior trunk, and, in addition, a hemorrhoidal branch of the pudic ar- tery ; while the latter comprise the remaining branches of the internal iliac artery. The branches given off from the internal iliac artery may be again arranged, on a basis of their distribution, in three distinct sets as follows: I. Those which pass out of the pelvis. Obturator. Gluteal. Sciatic or ischiatic. Internal pudic. II. Those distributed to the walls of the pelvic cavity (2) III. Those distributed to pelvic viscera (6) Total, 12 Lateral sacral. Ilio-lumbar. Vesical arterius (3). Middle hemorrhoidal. vlginal'.|InfemaIeonly- The vesical branches are usually three in number, and are dis- tributed to the bladder, the prostate gland, and the vesiculae seminales. From the superior vesical branch, a twig is given off called the artery of the vas deferens. The middle hemorrhoidal branch joins with the superior he- morrhoidal branch of the inferior* mesenteric, and with the infe- rior hemorrhoidal branch of the internal pudic artery. The uterine branches, distributed in the folds of the broad ligament, supply the neck and body of the uterus. The vaginal branch descends upon the vagina to the neck of the bladder and the rectum.

247 MUSCLES OF THE THORAX. forated by three openings for the passage of important structures. These openings, will be found described, in detail, under the head- ing “ openings in the abdominal walls,” in subsequent pages of this volume. Insertion. Into the central tendon of the diaphragm. Nervous supply. The phrenic nerve, a branch of the cervical plexus. The shortest fibres of this muscle arise from the ensiform appendix. The longest fibres of this muscle arise from the liga- mentum arcuatum externum and from the sides of the chest. The ligamentum arcuatum internum is a tendinous arch extend- ing across the psoas magnus muscle, on each side of the spinal column. It is connected to the bodies of the 1st and 2nd lumbar vertebrae, at its inner extremity, and to the transverse process, at its outer extremity. The ligamentum arcuatum externum is the thickened upper margin of the anterior lamella of the transversalis fascia, which arches across the quadratus lumborum muscle, on either side ; and which is attached, at its inner extremity, to the transverse pro- cess of the 2nd lumbar vertebra, and, at its outer extremity, to the apex and the lower margin of the last rib. ACTION OF THE MUSCLES OF THE THORAX. These muscles are chiefly aids in the acts of mspiration and of expiration. They are assisted, however, in these complex muscular efforts, by certain other muscles which have been classed under the respective heads of those of the upper extremities, back, neck, and abdomen. As the action of these muscles upon respiration is important, from a physiological point of view, and, as the auxiliary muscles often play a most important part in the complete performance of these acts, classified tables are appended of all the muscles which Origin. In front, from the ensiform cartilage.

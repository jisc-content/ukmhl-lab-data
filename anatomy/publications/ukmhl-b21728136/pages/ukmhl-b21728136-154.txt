I32 BONES OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY. extremities. At birth, the extremities are cartilagin- ous. At about the second year of age, ossification commences in the head of the bone, and, about the third year of age, the centre for the tuberosities makes its appearance. By the fifth year, the head and tuber- osities become joined together and so form a single epiphysis. The lower end of the humerus exhibits ossification at the end of the second year, in the radial portion of the articular surface. The centre for the trochlear por- tion of the articular surface does not appear until about the twelfth year of age. At the fifth year of age, ossification commences in the internal condyle, but the external condyle does not exhibit any trace of ossification until the age of thirteen or fourteen years. At the seventeenth year of age, the outer condyle and the whole articulating surface of the bone unite with the shaft; at eighteen years of age, the in- ner condyle becomes united, while the upper epiphysis, although the first formed, is not joined to the shaft until about the twentieth year of age. Articulation. The humerus articulates with three bones, as follows: Above with the glenoid cavity of the scapula, and, below, with the ulna and the radius. THE ULNA. The ulna is the most internal bone of the fore-arm. It is larger and longer than the radius, since it possesses the olecranon process and is larger in its upper than its lower portion. It may be divided into an upper extremity, a lower extremity and a shaft. Upper Extremity. This portion of the ulna is the largest and strongest portion of the bone. It presents two large processes, called the coronoid and the olecranon processes, and two depressions, called the greater and the lesser sigmoid cavities. Processes. The CORONOID PROCESS of the ulna is prismatic in form and projects forwards towards the anterior sur- face of the forearm. It presents for examination an

The external bile ducts of the liver as well as the gall-bladder consist of a peritoneal coat, a fibro-muscular coat, and a mucous coat. THE PANCREAS. The pancreas is a long flattened organ, of a reddish cream- color, situated opposite to the 2nd lumbar vertebra. It lies be- hind the stomach, and presents the following points of interest. A head or right extremity. A body or central portion. A tail or left extremity. A duct or the canal of Wirsung. The head is contained within the cavity of the duodenum, and is in close relation with the ductus communis choledochus and the pancreatico-duodenal arteries. The body is flattened, and extends transversely across the cavity of the abdomen. It has the following relations with sur_ rounding parts. In front... Stomach and Peritoneum. Left kidney and its capsule. r Inferior vena cava. Aorta. The mesenteric arteries, j inferior"' Portal vein. ^ Left renal vessels. Crura of the diaphragm. b Left quadratus lumborum muscle. Above Coeliac axis, splenic artery and vein. Below Duodenum and superior mesenteric vessels. Behind. A Vessels’ <5>‘ The tail lies in contact with the kidney of the left side and with the spleen. The duct, called the canal of Wirsung, communicates with the cavity of the pancreas, which extends throughout the en- tire length of the body of the gland. It joins with the ductus communis choledochus and opens, in common with it, at the summit of the small papilla on the inner aspect of the descend-

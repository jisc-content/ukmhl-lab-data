244 MYOLOGY. Diagram Illustrating the 7 Layers forming the Abdominal Wall in the Iliac Region. Integument. Superficial fascia (two layers.) External oblique muscle. Internal oblique muscle. Transversalis muscle. Peritoneum. This diagram is designed to show the coverings which suc- cessively are acquired by any hernial protrusions of omentum or intestine in the inguinal or iliac region. Although this diagram only represents seven layers as constituting the entire thickness of the abdominal wall, still the second layer will be perceived to consist of two separate portions. For this reason the coverings of inguinal hernia are usually described by anatomists as eight in number.

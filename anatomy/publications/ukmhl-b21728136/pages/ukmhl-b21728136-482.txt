NEUROLOGY. 4$o The flocculus, sub-peduncular lobe, or pneumogastnc lobule. The amygdala lobe or the tonsil. The digastric lobe. The slender lobe. The posterior inferior lobe. The vermiform process, on its under surface, presents the fol- lowing parts which have been specially named : The pyramid. The uvula. The commissura brevis, which connects the two sur- faces of the vermiform process. The Circumference of the Cerebellum. This portion of the cerebellum presents for examination the following parts : Two vertical fissures, called : The incisura cerebelli anterior. The incisura cerebelli posterior. A great horizontal fissure, which extends from the middle peduncle of one hemisphere to the same point upon the opposite side. Processes of the Cerebellum. The cerebellum is connected to the medulla oblongata, the pons Varolii, and the cerebrum, by three processes, which are called, from below upwards, as follows. The inferior, or processus e cerebello ad medullam. The middle, or processus e cerebello ad pontem. The superior, or processus e cerebello ad testes. The grey matter of the cerebellum consists of three distinct parts or layers, as follows: (1) External layer of small cells, both round and polar in form, and nerve fibres. (2) Middle layer of cells with long processes penetrating into the external layer, called the cells of Purkinje. (3) Internal layer, called the granular layer, formed by dense masses of granular corpuscles.

349 EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY. EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY. This artery arises from a point corresponding to the upper border of the thyroid cartilage and is directed upwards towards an interval which exists between the neck of the condyle of the jaw and the external auditory meatus, where it divides into its two terminal branches, viz., the temporal and internal maxillary arteries. In its course, which is slightly curved upon itself, it presents, at its lower portion, a curve, the concavity of which looks towards the lobule of the ear ; and, midway, between its points of origin and termination, it takes a sharp inclination back- wards into the interval where it terminates. The point of bifur- cation of the external carotid artery lies on a level with the con- dyle of the jaw. In its course through the neck it gives off eight branches of varying sizes, and therefore diminishes rapidly in its calibre as it approaches its point of bifurcation. In the adult, this artery is of nearly equal size with the inter- nal carotid although, in the foetus, it is usually smaller. It is more superficially placed near its point of origin than at its point of termination. Its average length varies from 2f to 3J inches although it may occasionally reach a length of four inches or even fall short of the normal standard.

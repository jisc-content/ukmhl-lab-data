SKELETON OF THE TRUNK. 84 has a facet on its anterior sur- face for the attachment of the tubercle of the rib. In a few of the lower dorsal ver- tebrae, upon the posterior surface of this process, are found three tubercles called the external, in- ferior and superior. ARTICULAR PROCESSES. The two superior look backwards and slightly outwards. The two inferior look forwards and slightly inwards. Lumbar Vertebrae. These vertebra are of very large size. Their chief characteristics may be thus enumerated : Is very large. BODY. Is broadest in its transverse diameter. Is thicker in front than behind. PEDICLES. The pedicles are thick and strong. They arise from the upper portion of the body. NOTCHES. The inferior notches are the deepest and broadest. Lamina. The laminae are short, thick and very broad. SPINAL foramen. The spinal opening is triangular in shape. Is larger than in the dorsal region but smaller than in the cervical region. SPINOUS PROCESS. This process is thick, is quadrilateral in shape, and ends in a rough, vertical border. TRANSVERSE PROCESSES. These processes are long and slender. They are directed horizontally out- wards. They are situated in front of the articular processes. They are also located behind the pedicles. On the posterior surface of each, near its base, is a small tubercle called the accessory tubercle, which points downwards and inwards. ARTICULAR PROCESSES. These processes are very thick and strong. They are placed vertically.

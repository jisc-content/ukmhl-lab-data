ANGIOLOGY. 358 ical obstruction to a rapid current of blood entering the brain, since increased friction is thus produced and danger of rupture of the cerebral capillaries from excessive hearts action is thus ob- viated. This artery is usually studied as to its course and relations, by dividing it into four distinct portions. 1st. The cervical portion which includes all of the artery below the carotid canal. 2d. The petrous portion, including that part of the artery which lies within the carotid canal. 3d. The cavernous portion, which includes that part of the artery lying in relation to the cavernous sinus, and 4th. The cerebral portion, or the balance of the artery before it divides into its terminal branches. The internal carotid artery is distributed to the brain, and the eye and its appendages. In point of calibre, it equals that of the external carotid artery. Cervical portion. This portion of the internal carotid artery lies at first upon the outer side of the external carotid artery, but soon sinks beneath the. parotid gland, and becomes very deeply situated, as it passes behind and underneath that vessel. In its course, it is separated from the external carotid artery by two muscles, viz., the stylo-glossus and the stylo-pharyngeus muscles; and by two nerves, the glosso-pharyngeal and the pharyn- geal branch of the pneumogastric.

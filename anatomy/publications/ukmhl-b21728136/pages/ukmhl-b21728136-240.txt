218 MYOLOGY. scapular notch, and, occasionally, from the ligament which crosses the notch. Insertion. Into the lower border of the body of the hyoid bone. Nervous supply. From three sources, viz., the hypoglossal or 12th cranial nerve, a filament of the pneumogastric or ioth cranial nerve, and a filament from the cervical plexus of nerves. It is thus associated (i) with the move- ments of the tongue, (2) with the function of respira- tion, and (3) with the movements of the muscles of the neck. The central tendon of this muscle is attached to the clavicle by the deep cervical fascia, which forms a loop about it. The omo-hyoid muscle, in long and thin necks, may be dis- cerned through the skin as a cord running parallel with and above the line of the clavicle, and rising and falling with the acts of in- spiration and of expiration. It renders tense that portion of the cervical fascia, which lies over the apex of the lung, and its pos- terior belly is, by some anatomists, considered as analogous to a serration of the serratus magnus ; its central tendon to a rudi- mentary cervical rib; and its anterior belly, to a sterno-hyoid muscle. It is a guide to the seat of election in the operation for ligation of the common carotid artery. SUPRA OR GENIO-HYOID GROUP. (6 muscles). Digastric. This muscle consists of two elongated muscular bellies, united by an intervening rounded tendon. It extends from the mastoid process of the temporal bone to the symphysis of the lower jaw. Origin. The posterior belly arises from the digastric groove, on the inner side of mastoid process of the temporal bone, and the anterior belly from a fossa on the inner side of the symphysis of the chin. Insertion. The central tendon is attached to the body and greater cornu of the hyoid bone, by a broad band of aponeurotic fibres, in the form of a loop, lined by a syn- ovial membrane. The posterior belly passes through the stylo-hyoid muscle.

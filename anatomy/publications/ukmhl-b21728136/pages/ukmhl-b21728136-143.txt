121 THE SCAT [/LA. BONES OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY. The upper extremity is a jointed appendage, which is con- nected to the trunk, at its upper portion, while, below that point, it is free for the rest of its extent. It is divided into four parts, viz., the shoulder, the arm, the forearm, and the hand. In the following table are enumerated the bones which assist to form each of these various portions. The Bones of each of the Upper Extremities are thirty-two in number, â€¢< and are situated as follows: Forming the shoulder (2) j Qavide Forming the arm (i)-{ Humerus. Forming the forearm (2) Forming the hand (27) Radius. Ulna. ' Scaphoid. Semilunar. Cuneiform. Pisiform. Trapezium. Trapezoid. Os Magnum. Unciform. Metacarpal bones, (5). _ Phalanges, (14). Carpus (8) Total, 32 THE SCAPULA. This bone is large in its size and flat and triangular in form. It is situated at the back of the shoulder, being often called the shoulder blade, and extends from the 2nd to the 7th rib. It pre- sents for special description two surfaces, three borders and three angles. Anterior Surface. The anterior surface or venter of the scapula looks towards the ribs, is concave and forms the so-called subscapular fossa. This fossa is deepest at its upper and outer part, where the sub- scapular angle exists, and presents, from within outwards, the following points: 1. A narrow marginal surface, which extends from the supe- rior to the inferior angles of the bone and which af- fords attachment to the serratus magnus muscle. 2. Roughened oblique ridges, which converge at the upper and outer portion of the bone. These ridges afford attach- ment for the subscapularis muscle. 3. A prominent ridge, which is rounded and which descends from the neck of the bone, parallel to its anterior border.

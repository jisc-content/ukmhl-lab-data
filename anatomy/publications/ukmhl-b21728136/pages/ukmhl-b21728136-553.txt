THE PERITONEUM. 525 10. Its longitudinal muscular layer is arranged as three distinct bands, while, in the small intestine, it is evenly dis- tributed over its entire circumference. 11. The serous covering of the large intestine does not com- pletely surround it, in all of its portions, and forms pouches, called appendices epiploicce. THE PERITONEUM. The peritoneum is the serous membrane which lines the ab- dominal cavity, and which invests the viscera. Its numerous prolongations and reflections may be arranged under three heads as follows : 1. Omenta or epiploa. 2. MESOS or MESENTERIES. 3. Ligaments. The three following rules will assist the student as guides to the proper use and application of these terms. I. When a fold of the peritoneum connects the STOMACH to an adjoining organ, the fold is termed an omentum or epiploon. Of these there are three within the abdomen, viz. 1. Gastro-hepatic or lesser omentum. 2. Gastro-colic or greater omentum. 3. Gastro-splenic omentum. II. When a process or fold of peritoneum connects any por- tion of the INTESTINAL CANAL (except the duodenum) to the abdominal wall, it is called a meso or mesentery, and a special name of any particular portion, process, or fold is obtained, by prefixing the word meso to the attached portion of the intestinal canal. As examples of this we have the following terms. Meso-caecum. Meso-colon. Meso-rectum. III. When the peritoneum connects either a solid or hollow organ which is not a part of the intestinal canal, to the adjacent parts, it is called a ligament. Thus we have formed certain liga- ments of the liver, the spleen, the uterus, the bladder, etc. The peritoneum may be divided into two layers termed the parietal and the visceral layer. The former covers the walls of the abdominal cavity, and the latter is reflected upon the numer- ous viscera contained within it. The visceral layer of the peritoneum affords a partial covering

143 BONES OF THE CARPUS. In this diagram the black dots indicate the carpal bones in their relation to each other and the bones of the forearm. The connecting lines indicate the points of articulation of each part in the diagram, so that by tracing all the lines from any given part the articulation of that part can easily be ascertained. It is easy to recognize whether any bone of the carpus belongs to the right or left side, when it is placed in position by the fol- lowing guides : Scaphoid. 1. The largest articular facet is above. 2. The tubercle is on its outer side. 3. The transverse groove is behind. Semilunar. 1. The convex articular facet is above. 2. The largest rough surface is in front. 3. The semilunar facet is on its outer side. Cuneiform. 1. The convex surface is directed upwards. 2. The flat surface lies in front. 3. The small surface or angle lies on the inner side. Pisiform. 1. The articular facet lies posteriorly. 2. The concave surface lies on the inner side. Trapezium. 1. The saddle-shaped articular facet lies below. 2. The ridge is directed forwards. 3. The rough lateral surface is directed outwards. Trapezoid. 1. The saddle-shaped articular facet looks downwards. 2. The large rough surface lies posteriorly. 3. The projecting part lies on the inner side. OS MAGNUM. 1. The head of the bone looks upward. 2. The large rough surface lies posteriorly. 3. The tubercle of the base lies on the inner side. Unciform. 1. The unciform process lies in front and near its lower part. 2. The concavity of the bone is directed outwards. METACARPAL BONES. The bones of the metacarpus are five in number, and are

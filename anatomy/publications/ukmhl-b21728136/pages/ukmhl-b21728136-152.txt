BONES OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY. 130 wards. It presents for examination three borders and three surfaces. The borders are called respectively, the anterior, the internal and the external, while the surfaces are named the internal, the external and the posterior. Borders. The anterior border of the shaft of the humerus ex- tends from the front of the great tuberosity, above, to the coronoid depression, below, and forms the anterior or outer lip of the bicipital groove. The internal border of the shaft extends from the lesser tuberosity of the bone to its internal condyle. It forms, at its upper part, the inner or posterior lip of the bicipital groove, and, below, it forms the inter- nal condyloid ridge. At the middle portion of this border is perceived the orifice of the nutrient canal of the bone, which is directed downwards. The external border of the shaft extends from the back portion of the greater tuberosity to the external condyle. It is less distinct than the two other bor- ders and is crossed, above, by the musculo-spiral groove. At its lower portion, it becomes more prom- inent and forms the external condyloid ridge. Surfaces. The internal surface is narrower than the external. It presents, in its middle portion, a roughened im- pression for the attachment of the coraco-brachialis, and, towards its lower portion, it frequently presents a bony prominence called the supra-condyloid process. The external surface is broader than the internal. At its middle portion, it presents a rough triangular impression for the deltoid muscle, and, below this sur- face, it affords attachment to the brachialis anticus muscle. The posterior surface is somewhat twisted in its course. It is crossed, obliquely downwards and out- wards, by the musculo-spiral groove, and, above and below this groove, it affords attachment to the outer and inner heads of the triceps muscle.

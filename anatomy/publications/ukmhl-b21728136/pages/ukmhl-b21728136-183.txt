ME TA TARSAL BONES. 161 Plan of the Metatarsal Articulation. Cuneiform. In this diagram are represented, the three cuneiform and cuboid bones and the five metatarsal bones. The lines, represent the points of articulation of the second and fourth metatarsal bones. It will thus be perceived that the first metatarsal bone has only one point of articulation with the tarsus, that the second has three, that the third has one, that the fourth has two, and that the fifth has one. A person, jumping and alighting upon the toes, has twenty-two joints and forty-four articulations to distribute the shock. These may be enumerated as follows: Metatarsal Articulations, 8. Tarsus (7x4) 28. Tibia, 3. Fibula, 2. Femur, 2. Os Innominatum, 1. Total 44.-1-2=22 joints. If concussion is received upon the heel, only six joints and twelve articulations distribute the shock. These six joints are as follows: Os Calcis, 1 Astragalus, 3 Tibia, 3 Fibula, 2 Femur, 2 Os Innominatum, i Total i2.-f-2 = 6 joints. It will be seen that the total number of articulations has been

The cerebrum, in man, constitutes the largest portion of the brain. Its upper surface is of an ovoidal form, broader behind than in front, convex in its general outline, and divided into two lateral halves or hemispheres, the right and left, by the great longitudinal fissure. This fissure extends throughout the entire length of the cerebrum in the middle line, reaching down to the base of the brain in front and behind, but interrupted in the mid- dle by a broad transverse commissure of white matter, the corpus callosum, which connects the two hemispheres together. This fissure lodges the falx cerebri, and indicates the original develop- ment of the brain by two lateral halves. Each hemisphere presents for examination an outer surface, which is convex, to corresrond with the vault of the cranium ; an

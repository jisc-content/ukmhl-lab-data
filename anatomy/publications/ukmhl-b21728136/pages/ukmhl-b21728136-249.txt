ACTION OF MUSCLES OF NECK. 227 Insertion. Into the median raphe of the pharynx, and, by a few fibres into the basilar process of the occipital bone. Nervous supply. The glosso-pharyngeal nerve and the pharyngeal plexus. Superior Constrictor. Origin. 1. From the internal pterygoid plate (lower third) and from the palate bone. 2. From the pterygo-maxillary ligament. 3. From the aponeurosis, arising from the petrous portion of temporal bone. 4. From the posterior part of the alveolar process of the inferior maxillary bone, above the mylo-hyoid ridge. 5. From the base of the tongue. Insertion. Into the median tendinous raphe of the pharynx and the basilar process of the occipital bone. Nervous supply. The glosso-pharyngeal nerve and the pharyngeal plexus. Action of the Various Groups of Muscles of the Neck. The superficial layer of muscles assist in depression of the head, inclination of the head to one side, depression of the lower jaw, and, through the platysma myoides, in the expression of melancholy. The infra-hyoid group of muscles act as depressors of the larynx after it has been raised during the act of deglutition. They also act as tensors of the cervical fascia. The supra or genio-hyoid group of muscles are important agents in the act of deglutition, since, by them, the hyoid bone is raised, and with it, the larynx, trachea, pharynx and oesophagus ; the superior opening of the larynx is closed, and the bolus of food is controlled by the numerous movements of the tongue. In case liquids be swallowed by suction, the tongue is given a proper longitudinal concavity, by the hyoglossus muscle, to afford a chan- nel for the fluid, after the vacuum in the mouth has been created. The stylo-hyoid group of muscles act upon the pharynx and the tongue. During their contraction, the pharynx is opened and widened for the entrance of food during deglutition, and the base of the tongue is drawn backwards and upwards over the elevated

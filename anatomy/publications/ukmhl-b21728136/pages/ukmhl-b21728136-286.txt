MYOLOGY. 264 of the vagina by its contraction. The erector clitoridis performs, for that organ, the same function as the erector penis in the male, but differs from it in its smaller size, since the clitoris requires less muscular support for its proper maintenance, during its erection. The levator ani muscle acts as a support to the lower end of the rectum and the bladder, during their efforts to expel the feces and the urine. In the female, however, it gives additional sup- port to the vaginal walls. The coccygeus muscle supports and raises the coccyx, after it has been displaced backward during the acts of defecation or of parturition. NERVOUS SUPPLY OF THE MUSCLES OF THE PERINEUM. The nervous supply to all the muscles of the perineum, save one, is derived from one source, namely, the branches of the inter- nal pudic nerve. The special branches of this nerve, however, which supply the muscles of the perineum are as follows: (Inferior hemorrhoidal branch of in- ternal pudic nerve Perineal nerve (cutaneous branch)... Perineal nerve (muscular branches).. 5th Sacral nerve (ant. branch), Erector penis. Accelerator urin^e. Transversus perinei. Compressor urethr.e. Sphincter ani externus. Levator ani. Coccygeus. Erector clitoridis. Sphincter vaginje. Sphincter ani internus. Total, 11 muscles. Deduct one muscle supplied from two sources (the spincter ani). Total, 10 muscles. CAVITIES OF THE TRUNK. Appended to the trunk, whose muscles we have been consid- ering in this chapter, are two large cavities, viz., the cavity of the thorax and the cavity of the abdomen. These cavities contain important viscera and large arterial, venous, and nervous trunks. Important ganglia are also located within these special regions, and the sympathetic system is here most extensively developed.

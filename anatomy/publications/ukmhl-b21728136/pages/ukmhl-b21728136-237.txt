215 MUSCLES OF THE NECK. The “ obicularis oris ” muscle, (single.) II. Muscles of vision. The orbital group. 7 pairs. III. Muscles of mastication. The maxillary group. 4 pairs. The labial group of muscles, which have been classed as mus- cles of expression, assists also in mastication and in the acts of talking and singing, but they have been classified as muscles of expression, since, as a group, this seems a most important function. NERVOUS SUPPLY OF THE MUSCLES OF THE HEAD. Of these several groups of muscles, the motor nerves of the epicranial, the auricular, the palpebral, the nasal, and the labial groups (in all twenty pairs and one single muscle) are derived from one nerve, viz., the facial or 7th cranial nerve. The maxillary group also derives its motor power from one nerve, viz., the anterior or smaller branch of the inferior max- illary division of the 5th cranial nerve, while all the muscles of the orbit are supplied by the motor oculi or 3rd cranial nerve, except the superior oblique and the external rectus muscles, the former of which is supplied by the 4th cranial nerve and the latter by the 6th cranial nerve. B. MUSCLES OF THE NECK. The muscles of the neck consist of 45 pairs and one single muscle. They may be arranged in 9 classes or groups. I. Superficial lateral group: . ( II. Infra or sterno-hyoid group :.., III. Supra or genio-hyoid group:.. Anterior belly of digastric. Mylo-hyoid. Genio-hyoid. Genio-hyo-glossus. Hyo-glossus. Lingualis. IV.

383 BRANCHES OF THYROID AXIS. THE THYROID AXIS. This large arterial trunk arises from the anterior aspect of the subclavian artery, at a point slightly internal to the inner margin of the scalenus anticus muscle. Its average length is about one quarter of an inch. It divides into three large trunks called as follows : Inferior thyroid artery. Transversalis colli artery. Supra-scapular artery. INFERIOR THYROID ARTERY. This vessel passes beneath the sheath of the common carotid artery (which encloses also the jugular vein and the pneumogas- tric nerve) and in front of the vertebral artery, before it reaches its point of distribution within the body of the thyroid gland. The middle cervical ganglion of the sympathetic nerves fre- quently lies upon this artery, after it has passed underneath the carotid sheath. The branches of the inferior thyroid artery are : Laryngeal. CEsophageal. Tracheal. Ascending cervical. The laryngeal branch supplies the mucous membrane of the larynx and the muscles of that region. The tracheal branch is distributed to the trachea and anast- omoses with the bronchial arteries (branches of the thoracic aorta). Thz'oesophageal branches are distributed to the oesophagus. The ascending cervical branch is irregular in its point of origin. It ascends the neck in close relation with the phrenic nerve. SUPRA-SCAPULAR ARTERY. This artery passes downwards and inwards from its point of origin, and, under protection of the clavicle, reaches the supra- scapular fossa. In its course it crosses the phrenic nerve and passes between the subclavian artery and its vein. It anasto- moses in the supra-scapular fossa, with the dorsalis scapulae artery (a branch of the subscapular) and the acromial thoracic artery (a branch of the axillary). It supplies the shoulder joint. Its branches are as follows: Muscular. Supra-acromial. The muscular branches are distributed to the adjacent muscles along its course.

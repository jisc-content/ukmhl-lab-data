339 THE AORTA. necessity, create upon this local point the greatest friction and degenerative changes would therefore be first manifested at this situation. The first portion of the aortic arch presents for examination the following points of interest: (1) The coronary arteries. (2) The sinuses of Valsalva. (3) A constriction at the bases of the aortic valves. 1. The coronary arteries are two in number, the right and the left. The right coronary artery arises from that sinus of Valsalva, in which the anterior segment of the aortic valve is lodged during the contraction of the ventricle; while the coronary artery of the left side arises from that sinus which lodges the left poste- rior segment. They will be described in detail in subsequent pages. 2. The sinuses of Valsalva are depressions in the walls of the aorta for the reception of the aortic valves. By their size and depth, they cause an increased circumferential measurement of the aorta, at a point corresponding to their situation. Thus the average circumference of the aorta over the sinuses of Valsalva, may be stated as about four inches, while immediately above them the circumference falls to three and a quarter or three and a half inches. At the situation of the sinus magnum, the aorta, how- ever, again expands to a circumference in excess of even the neighborhood of the sinuses of Valsalva. 3. The first portion of the aortic arch presents, finally, a con- striction at the bases of the aortic valves, due to on excess of white fibrous tissue over the elastic tissue of the aorta and which is probably destined as a source of protection to the aortic orifice against dilatation or rupture. The ascending portion of the arch of the aorta is partly in- vested by the pericardium, which is prolonged upon its coats for a distance of nearly two inches. The relation which this portion of the aorta bears to sur- rounding structures may be seen by reference to the following table.

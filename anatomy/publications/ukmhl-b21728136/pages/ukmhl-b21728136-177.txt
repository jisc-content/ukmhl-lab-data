155 THE FIBULA. The head of the fibula is one of the prominent bony points of the knee, and lies about on the same level as does the tubercle of the tibia. Lower Extremity. This portion of the fibula forms the external malle- olus. On its inner surface is a triangular facet for artic- ulation with the astragalus. The posterior portion is grooved for the tendons of the peronei muscles. Shaft. The shaft of the fibula presents three surfaces, an external, internal, and posterior, and three borders. The external surface affords attachment to the two peronei muscles. The internal surface is marked, along its middle por- tion, by the interosseous ridge for the attachment of the interosseous membrane. The posterior surface is twisted and presents, at about its middle, the nutrient foramen of the bone which is directed downwards. The shaft of the fibula arches backwards, in direct contrast with the shaft of the tibia, and affords little if any assistance in supporting the weight of the body. The difference in the curve of the shafts of the two bones of the leg has a practical value in performing amputations in this region, since the direction of the flap incisions is modified in accordance with it. Muscles Attached to Fibula. The fibula affords attachment to nine muscles, as follows : The F ibula affords attach- ment to 9 muscles, as fol- -{ lows: 'To the styloid process...

The fibula is developed by three centres of ossification ; one for the shaft, and one for each extremity. In the fibula, the centre

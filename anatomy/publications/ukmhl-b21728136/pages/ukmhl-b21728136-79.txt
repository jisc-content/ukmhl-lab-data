THE INFERIOR MAXILLARY BONE. 5 7 grooves and canals. It looks outwards and forms a portion of the outer wall of the nasal fossa. The upper border of the inferior turbinated bone articulates, in front, with the inferior turbinated crest of the superior maxillary bone. It presents also for examination the following points of interest. (i.) The lachrymal process, which articulates with the lachry- mal and the superior maxillary bone and helps to form the nasal duct. (2.) The maxillary process, which curves downwards and out- wards over the lower edge of the orifice of the antrum of Highmore. (3.) The ethmoidal process, which ascends to join the unciform process of the ethmoid bone. The lower border of this bone is free and is about one-half inch above the floor of the nose, so that sufficient room exists to pass the tube of a stomach-pump, if circumstances should demand it. Muscles. No muscle is attached to the inferior turbinated bone. Articulation. r„, , ( Mesial bone (1) ■{ Ethmoid.

The inferior turbinated bone is developed by one centre of ossification, which appears about the middle of foetal life. THE INFERIOR MAXILLARY BONE. The lower jaw is one of the mesial or single bones of the body. It is shaped like a horse-shoe,and consists of a middle horizontal portion called the body of the bone, and two lateral vertical por- tions called the rami of the bone. These two portions will be ex- amined separately. Body. This portion of the inferior maxillary bone presents for ex- amination an exterior and interior surface, and a superior and inferior border. The exterior or cutaneous surface is convex, from side to side, and concave, from above downwards. It presents the following points of special interest:

It will be perceived that the oesophagus bears a triple relation to this vessel, being situated in front, and on the left and right sides of the artery. This seeming contradiction is due to the fact that the oesophagus constantly alters its relation to the thoracic aorta, on account of the curve taken by that vessel in its descent through the chest. Branches. In the following table are enumerated the five sets of branches of the thoracic aorta and their points of distribution. A TABLE OF THE BRANCHES OF THE THORACIC AORTA. THORACIC AORTA.

The bronchial arteries are the nutrient vessels of the lungs, and vary in number, size, and origin. That of the right side arises from the first aortic intercostal; or, by a common trunk with the left bronchial, from the front of the thoracic aorta. Those of the left side, usually two in number, arise from the thoracic aorta, one

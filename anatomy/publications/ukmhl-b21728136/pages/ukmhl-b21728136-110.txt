SKELETON OF THE TRUNK 88 THE 7TH CERVICAL VERTEBRA OR VERTEBRA PROMINENS. The spinous process of this vertebra is very thick, long, and prominent, from its horizontal position. It ends in a single tubercle for the attachment of ligamentum nuchae. The transverse processes are large, but slightly grooved, and seldom bifid. Its foramen is small or it may be absent. 1ST DORSAL VERTEBRA. This vertebra presents a complete facet for the head of the 1st rib, and a demi-facet, below, for the upper facet of the head of the 2nd rib. Its articular process is slightly oblique in its axis, like the cer- vical vertebrae. 9th DORSAL VERTEBRA. This vertebra has only one demi-facet on the upper part of the body. ioth DORSAL VERTEBRA. This vertebra has but one facet on the upper portion of the body, and one on the transverse process. i ith DORSAL VERTEBRA. This vertebra has only one facet. The transverse processes are short and have no articular facet for the ri 3. 12TH DORSAL VERTEBRA. This vertebra has but one facet for the rib, which is always complete. No facet for the rib exists on its transverse process. The inferior articular surfaces are convex and look forwards and outwards, like the lumbar vertebrae. 5TH LUMBAR VERTEBRA. The body is markedly thicker in front than behind. The spinous process is small. The inferior articular processes are wider apart than the su- perior. The transverse processes are large, thick and are inclined slightly upwards.

INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY. 355 Petrous portion. In this portion of the artery, the cavity of the middle ear is in the closest relation, being separated from it only by a thin lamella of bone, which in a young subject is cribriform, and, in old age, is often nearly deficient from absorption. The artery is separated from contact with the bony walls of the carotid canal by an investing tubular process of the dura mater; but has in direct contact with it the carotid plexus of nerves. Cavernous portion. On reaching the body of the sphenoid bone, after entering the cavity of the cranium, the internal carotid artery enters the cavernous sinus, having first perforated a layer of dura mater, which forms the outer border of that cavity. Within this sinus the following relations are important, and may be shown by the following diagram. * Internally. Internal carotid artery. 6th cranial nerve. Carotid plexus of nerves. Externally. 3rd cranial nerve. 4th cranial nerve. Ophthalmic branch of the 5th cranial nerve. Cerebral portion. This portion of the internal carotid artery lies on the outer side of .the optic nerve, having the 3d cranial nerve (motor oculi) external to it, and extends to the inner extremity of the fissure of Sylvius. The internal carotid artery may be wounded by deep pene- trating wounds received within the mouth, from stab wounds of the neck, or from gun shot wounds or lacerations, which envolve the deeper structures of the neck. It may also occasionally be wounded in operations upon the tonsil or may participate in the ulceration of severe attacks of supurative tonsilitis. Branches. The internal carotid artery gives off eight branches as follows : one, in the petrous portion ; three, in the cavernous portion ; and four, in the cerebral portion. The names of these branches are shown in the following table.

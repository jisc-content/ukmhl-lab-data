271 MUSCLES OF UPPER EXTREMITY. scapula upon the sides of the chest. If the shoulder be made a fixed point, these muscles will draw the scapula directly back- wards towards the spinal column; and, in this act, they are assisted by the middle and the inferior fibres of the trapezius. The pectoralis major muscle acts most frequently, in conjunc- tion with the teres major and the latissimus dorsi, in approxima- ting the arm to the chest wall after the arm has been raised by the. action of the deltoid. If it act singly, this muscle tends to â€¢ draw the arm forwards and inwards, thus bringing it across the anterior wall of the chest. If the arm be made a fixed point, this muscle, in connection with the pectoralis minor, the subclavius, and the latissimus dorsi, acts upon the ribs and thus all four of these muscles become aids to forcible inspiration. The pectoralis minor muscle tends to depress the point of the shoulder and to draw the scapula downwards and inwards towards the thorax. The subclavius muscle also depresses the shoulder, by drawing the clavicle downwards and forwards. The serratus magnus muscle is a most important inspiratory muscle. When the shoulders are fixed, it elevates the ribs and expands the chest wall and thus increases the size of the chest cavity. It also tends to elevate the point of the shoulder, by causing a rotation of the scapula, since it draws forwards the in- ferior angle and the base of the shoulder blade. It greatly assists the trapezius in supporting weights upon the shoulder, the thorax being at the same time rendered a fixed point, by preventing the escape of the included air.

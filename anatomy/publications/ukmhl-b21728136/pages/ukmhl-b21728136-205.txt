133 s JOINTS OF THE CARPUS. anterior and posterior interosseous arteries, and the ascending branches of the deep palmar arch. The nervous supply of the wrist joint is derived from the ulnar nerve. The wrist joint admits of all possible movements but that of rotation. The wrist joint is opened by inserting a knife, with its edge directed upwards and inwards, at the apex of the styloid process of the ulna. Articulations of the Carpus. Articulations of the bones of the proximal row. The first three bones of the carpus, viz., the scaphoid, the semilunar, and the cuneiform, are joined together by two arthrod- ial articulations. The ligaments of these articulations consist of two dorsal, two palmar, and two interosseous ligaments. The pisiform bone is joined to the cuneiform by a separate arthrodial joint, having a separate synovial membrane. The two ligaments of this joint connect the pisiform bone to the unciform bone and also to the base of the 5th metacarpal bone. Articidation of the bones of the distal row. The four bones comprising the second row of the carpus are joined together by three arthrodial articulations. The ligaments of these three articulations are three dorsal, three palmar and three interosseous ligaments. Articulation of the two rows of carpal bones. Upon each side of the wrist, two arthrodial articulations exist between the two rows of the carpus, and, in the centre, a variety of enarthrodial articulation is formed between the os magnum and the unciform bone above, and the scaphoid, semilunar, and cuneiform bones below. The inner arthrodial joint exists between the cuneiform and the unciform bone, while the outer is formed between the scaphoid bone, above, and the trapezium and trapezoid bones, below. The ligaments which unite the two rows of carpal bones con- sist of a dorsal, a palmar, and two lateral ligaments. The two lateral ligaments are continuous with the lateral ligaments of the wrist joint.

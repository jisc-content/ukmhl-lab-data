The following table of the branches of the arch of the aorta shows that five principal arterial trunks are given off, viz., the two coronary, the arteria innominata, the left common carotid and the left subclavian arteries. CORONARY ARTERIES. The two coronary arteries arise from the aorta close to its point of origin. The right coronary artery is largest in its size and arises from that sinus of Valsalva which lodges the anterior segment of the aortic valve; while the left coronary artery arises from that sinus of Valsalva which lodges the left posterior segment of the aortic valve. These two vessels form an arterial circle around the base of the heart, being lodged within the auriculo-ventricular grooves ; and they also anastomose, at the apex of the heart, through branches which run.in the-groove between the ventricles. The coronary, arteries receive their blood supply during the diastole of the heart, the blood being forced into them partly by gravity, and partly by the elastic recoil of the aorta ; although the circulation of these vessels is furthermore assisted by the relaxed condition of the heart walls. They supply the heart substance with nutrition, and empty their blood, through the coronary veins, into the right auricle of the heart.

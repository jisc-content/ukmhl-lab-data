ARTICULATIONS OF THE PELVIS. 175 costal-cartilages of the 8th, 9th and 10th rib. A synovial mem- brane is wanting in the first and the last of these articulations The ligaments of each of these joints are two in number, viz., a capsular and an intercostal, which bind the cartilages to- gether. D. ARTICULATIONS OF PELVIS. The articulations of the pelvis are four in number as follows: I. Sacro-iliac articulation. II. Pubic articulation. III. Sacro-coccygeal articulation. IV. Sacro-vertebral articulation. Each of these articulations require a separate description. Sacro-Iliac Articulation. This articulation is one of the synchondroses and presents five ligaments as follows : I. The anterior sacro-iliac ligament, which connects the an- terior surfaces of the sacrum and the ilium. II. The posterior sacro-iliac ligament, which connects the posterior portion of the lateral surface of the sacrum with the inner surface of the projecting portion of the ilium. III. The oblique sacro-iliac ligament, which connects the posterior superior spine of the ilium with the back of the third or fourth piece of the sacrum. Ligaments between the Sacrum and Ischium. The great sacro-sciatic ligament, which arises from the poste- rior inferior spine of the ilium, as well as from the posterior sur- faces and the margins of the sacrum and the coccyx, and is inserted into the inner margin of the tuberosity and the ascending ramus of the ischium. The lesser sacro-sciatic ligament, which arises from the mar- gins of the sacrum and of the coccyx and is inserted into the spine of the ischium. This ligament separates the greater and the lesser sacro-sciatic foramina. Pubic Articulation. This joint is one of the amphi-arthrodtal joints. It posesses four ligaments as follows : I. The anterior pubic ligament, wdiich connects the front sur- faces of the two pubic bones.

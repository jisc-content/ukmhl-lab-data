The transverse portion of the arch of the aorta begins at a point corresponding to the costo-sternal articulation of the sec- ond rib of the right side and terminates at a point corresponding to the superior border of the 3d dorsal vertebra. Its direction in the thorax is oblique, since it passes from before backwards and from the right towards the left side. From its upper or convex border, arise three important arterial trunks, viz., the arteria innominata, left carotid and left subclavian arteries. It varies in length from three to four inches. Its upper border is usually about an inch below the upper margin of the sternum, but it varies in its position somewhat during respiration, although less than the ascending portion of the arch.

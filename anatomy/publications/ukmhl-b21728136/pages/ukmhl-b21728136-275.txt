253 MUSECLS OF THE BACK. Insertion. Into the 2d, 3d, 4th and 5th ribs beyond their angles. Nervous supply. External posterior branches of the cervical nerves. Serratus Posticus Inferior. Origin. From the spinous processes of the last tw*o dorsal and the three upper lumbar vertebrae. Insertion. Into the lower borders of the last four ribs beyond their angles. Nervous supply. External posterior branches of the dorsal nerves. ACTION OF THE THIRD LAYER. The serrati are respiratory muscles acting in antagonism to each other. The serratus posticus superior elevates the ribs and is, therefore, an inspiratory muscle ; while the serratus posticus in- ferior draws the lower ribs downwards, and is a muscle of expira- tion. This latter muscle is also probably a tensor of the vertebral aponeurosis. 1

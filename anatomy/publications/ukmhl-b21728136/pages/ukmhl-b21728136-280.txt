258 MYOLOGY. Rotatores Spin^e, (eleven pairs). Origin. From the upper and back part of the transverse pro- cesses of the dorsal vertebrae. They are composed of the deepest fibres of the multifidus spinae muscle lying in the dorsal region. Insertion. Into the lower margin and posterior surface of the laminae and the root of the spinous process of the dor- sal vertebra, situated next above their point of origin. Nervous supply. The internal posterior branches of the dorsal nerves. Supra-Spinales. Are small fasciculi which lie upon the spinous pro- cesses of the vertebrae, in the cervical region. Nervous supply. Internal posterior branches of the cervical nerves. Inter-Spinales. Are small muscles placed between the spinous pro- cesses of the vertebrae. These are usually arranged as six pairs between the lower six cervical vertebrae ; four pairs in the lumbar region ; and occasionally two pairs attached to the upper and lower dorsal vertebrae. Nervous supply. Internal posterior branches of the cervical nerves. Extensor Coccygis. Origin. From the posterior surface of the last bone of the sacrum. Insertion. Into the lower part of the coccyx. Nervous supply. Internal posterior branches of the sacral nerves. INTER-TRANSVERSALES, (seven pairs.) These muscles are most marked in the cervical region, where seven pairs exist ; and are situated be- tween the transverse processes of the vertebrae. Nervous supply. Internal posterior branches of the cervical nerves.

415 POPLITEAL ARTERY. Collateral Circulation. After ligation of the femoral artery, the three following vessels maintain the circulation of the limb, by anastomotic channels, formed as indicated below. f Gluteal. External circumflex, with 3 arteries. < Ilio-lumbar. ( Circumflex iliac. Internal circumflex, with 2 arteries, j ^ Perforating arteries, with 1 artery Comes nervi ischiadici. POPLITEAL ARTERY. This artery commences at an opening in the lower part of the adductor magnus muscle, and, passing downwards and outwards to the back of the knee joint and then vertically downwards It terminates at the lower border of the popliteal muscle, where it di- vides into the anterior and posterior tibial arteries. Popliteal space. This artery is contained in a lozenge-shaped space called the popliteal space, with the following boundaries. Internally. The semimembranosus muscle, the inner head of gastrocnemius muscle, and the inner condyle of the femur. Externally. The biceps muscle, the outer head of gastrocne- mius muscle, the plantaris muscle, and the outer con- dyle of the femur. The floor of this space is formed by the posterior surface of the femur, the posterior ligament of the knee joint, the popliteus muscle, and the upper part of the tibia. This space contains the popliteal artery, popliteal vein, the internal popliteal nerve, the external popliteal nerve, the small sciatic nerve, the articular branch of the obturator nerve, the ex- ternal saphenous vein, and lymphatic glands and adipose tissue. The relations of the important parts contained within this space are as follows. The popliteal artery lies nearest to the floor. The popliteal vein lies superficial to the artery and slightly external to it. The internal popliteal nerve lies superficial to the vein and slightly external to it. The external popliteal nerve lies close to the tendon of the biceps muscle.

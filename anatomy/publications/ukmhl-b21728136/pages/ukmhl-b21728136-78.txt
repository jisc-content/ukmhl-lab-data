56 BONES OF THE FACE. E. The Sphenoidal Process. This projection from the palate bone curves upwards, back- wards and inwards. It presents for examination three surfaces, viz. : an upper, outer, and inner surface. The upper surface articulates with the sphenoid bone, and assists in forming the pterygo-palatine canal. The outer surface articulates with the pterygoid process of the sphenoid bone, and forms a small portion of the surface of the inner wall of the spheno-maxillary fossa. The inner surface is concave in its form and forms a portion of the outer wall of the nasal fossae. Muscles attached to the Palate Bone. ['To posterior nasal spine (i) -{ Azygos Uvulae.

Development of Palate Bone. The palate bone develops by a single centre of ossification, which is located at the point of junction of the horizontal and the vertical plates of that bone. THE INFERIOR TURBINATED BONES. This is a thin curved plate of bone which extends along the outer wall of the nasal fossa. It presents for examination two surfaces, an outer and inner, and an upper and lower border. The outer surface is concave, and forms a part of the inferior meatus of the nose. The inner surface is convex, and presents also vascular

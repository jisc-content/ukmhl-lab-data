MYOLOGY. 324 The plantar interossei of the right foot are thus inserted : 1*r. 20. 3p. 41}c. Great toe. Interosseii muscles. Phalanges. It will thus be seen that the four dorsal interosseii muscles abduct from the axis of the 2d toe, while the three plantar inter- ossei adduct to the axis of the 2d toe. The interossei muscles may therefore be considered, when referred to the axis of the 2d toe, to consist of four abductors and three adductors, but when referred to the mesial plane of the body, the order is reversed and they consist of three abductors and four adductors.

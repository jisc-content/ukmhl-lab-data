The muscles of the crural region, all of which act upon the foot, will be found described, in respect to their mode of action, in the closing pages of this chapter, since it has been deemed more expedient to consider the action of the muscles of the crural and pedal region in common, rather than separately. The classifications found upon page 324 of this work, will merit the earnest perusal and careful study of students in anatomy, since their mastery over this difficult subject will thus be rendered com- paratively easy. NERVOUS SUPPLY OF THE MUSCLES OF THE CRURAL REGION. The twelve muscles of the crural region receive their nervous motor supply from four sources, as follows: Into the base of the fifth metatarsal bone, Nervous supply. The anterior tibial nerve. The anterior tibial nerve supplies “ musculo-cutaneous “ internal popliteal posterior tibial Total, 12 muscles.

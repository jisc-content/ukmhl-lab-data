441 THE BRAIN OR ENCEPHALON. THE BRAIN OR ENCEPHALON. The brain forms the largest part of the cerebro-spinal axis and is contained in the cavity of the skull. In order to remove the brain, for the purposes of examination, the following structures have to- be divided : 1. The scalp. 2. The calvarium and the two temporal muscles. 3. The three membranes or meninges. 4. The twelve cranial nerves. 5. The four arterial trunks, viz.: the two internal car- otid and the two vertebral arteries. 6. The cerebral veins and sinuses. 7. The medulla oblongata, at its junction with the spinal cord. DIAGRAM OF THE BRAIN IN PROFILE. This cerebrum is represented in this diagram as separated from the cerebellum more than it naturally should be, in order to show certain important parts. A, the cerebrum ; B, the cerebellum ; C, the pons Varolii ; D, the medulla oblongata ; E, the crus cerebri ; F, the olivary body ; G, the tubercula quadrigemina ; S, the fissure of Sylvius ; R, the fissure of Rolando ; a, peduncles of cerebrum ; b, superior peduncles of the cerebellum ; c, middle peduncle of the cerebellum ; d, inferiorpeduncles of the cerebel- lum ; b, E, a, form the isthmus encephali.

421 THE VEINS IN GENERAL. Sinuses differ from veins in their structure and mode of distri- bution and are confined to special organs, within whose substance or their investing coverings they are usually situated. Veins communicate with each other more frequently than arteries, both in the larger and the smaller trunks ; thus the vence comites constantly communicate, in their course, by transverse branches, which cross the artery; and the various venous plexuses of the body afford another striking example of the tendency of veins towards frequent anastomosis. This tendency to fre- quent communication has been explained, as an effort on the part of nature to obviate the obstructions to which the veins are particularly liable, from the thinness of their coats; and also on account of their inability to overcome any impediment, from the weak force of their current. The veins, like the arteries, have walls composed of three dis- tinct coats. The internal coat resembles that of the arteries and is serous in character. The middle coat has less muscular fibre in its structure than exists in the arteries; and is also much thinner than in arteries of corresponding calibre. The external coat is composed chiefly of connective tissue and longitudinal elastic fibres. In the large veins connected with the heart, viz., the venae cavae and the four pulmonary veins, the muscular fibres of that organ are continued for some distance in their walls. The circulation within the venous system is due partly to the pressure transmitted from the arteries ; partly to muscular pressure aided by the valves ; partly to gravity, especially in the veins of the head, neck and thorax ; and partly to the suction created by the vacuum formed within the pleural and pericardial sacs during inspiration.

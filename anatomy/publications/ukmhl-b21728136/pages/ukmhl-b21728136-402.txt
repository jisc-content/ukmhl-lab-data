By some anatomists, the posterior scapular artery is given as a branch of the 3d portion of the subclavian artery, since it arises from that source perhaps as frequently as from the transversalis colli artery. It will, however, be described in this volume under the latter point of origin. Of the four primary branches given off by the subclavian ar- tery, three arise from the first portion of the vessel, viz., the vertebral, thyroid axis and internal mammary, and one from the second portion of the artery, viz.: the superior intercostal. Of these four branches, the vertebral arises from the upper and back part of the circumference of the vessel; the thyroid axis from the front portion ; the internal mammary from the under or lower aspect of the artery, but nearer to its anterior than its posterior surface; and the superior intercostal branch from the lower and posterior aspect of the artery, after the subclavian passes beneath the scalenus anticus muscle. By some anatomists the superior intercostal artery is given as a branch of the first portion upon the left side, but it is questionable if the percentage of dissections will verify this as the point of normal origin.

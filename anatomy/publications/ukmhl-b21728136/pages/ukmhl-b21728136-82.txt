The lower and posterior border. These borders are both thick and rounded, and form by their junction the angle of the jaw. This point gives attachment to the masseter, and the internal pterygoid muscles, and to the stylo-maxillary ligament. Muscles. The muscles attached to the lower jaw, number fifteen pairs, and may be thus classified : The Inferior Maxillary Bone gives attachment to 15 pairs of muscles, a s follows: To external surface (6)< To Body.(n) To \ internal surf ace.

Total, 15 pairs. Articulation. The lower jaw articulates with one pair of cranial bones, viz. : the two temporal bones. Development. This bone is developed, before any bone in the body, ex- cept the clavicle. It probably has two centres of ossification, one for each lateral half of the bone. By some authorities addi- tional centres are described as existing in the condyle, the coro- noid process,' the angle, and in a thin plate of bone on the inner side of the alveolar border.

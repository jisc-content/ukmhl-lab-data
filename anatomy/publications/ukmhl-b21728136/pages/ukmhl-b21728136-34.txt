12 MINUTE ANATOMY OF BONE. 3. Lacuna. These are seen as irregular dark spaces, which may be noticed to have a general circular arrangement around the Haversian canal. They contain the bone cell. 4. Haversian Spaces. These are larger and irregular-shaped spaces which con- nect the Haversian canals with the medullary spaces of cancellous bone tissue. They are found in young and in growing bones more extensively than in adult life. 5. Concentric Lamella. These are layers of bone tissue which are arranged around an Haversian canal as an axis. They enclose within their substance the lacunae of bone. 6. Circumferential Lamella. These are layers of bone which serve to unite or bind together the various Haversian canals and their concen- tric lamellae. 7. Interstitial Lamella. These are layers of bone tissue which are woven in and out between the concentric lamellae surrounding the various Haversian canals. Each Haversian canal, if taken in connection writh its numerous investing or concentric lamellae, is termed an Haversian System The vessels of bone consist of arteries, veins and lymphatics, although the latter have been denied by some of the more promi- nent observers. The arteries of bone are of three orders, as follows : 1. Nutrient Artery, which enters at the nutrient foramen and distributes branches along the entire length of the medullary canal of the bone. 2. Articular Vessels, which chiefly nourish the cancellous tis- sue of bone. 3. Periosteal Vessels, which ramify in the periosteum and which supply the compact tissue of bone with blood. The veins of bone, especially the long bone, emerge also in three distinct localities as follows: 1. By a large vein which accompanies the nutrient artery. 2. By numerous large and small veins, which emerge from the articular ends of the bone. 3. By many small veins which escape from the compact tissue along the length of the shaft.

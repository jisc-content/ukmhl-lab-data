THE VOMER. This bone forms the posterior and inferior part of the nasal septum. It is frequently deflected from the median line towards one side. It bears a fancied resemblance to the shape of a plough- share and presents for examination four borders and two surfaces. It articulates, by a deep groove between two projecting alee upon its superior border, with the rostrum of the sphenoid bone. These alae are overlapped inferiorly by the vaginal processes of the same bone. Its inferior border articulates with a ridge, formed by the palate plates of the superior maxillary and the palate bones. Its anterior border is grooved above for articulation with the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone, and below it is joined to the cartilage of the septum between the nares. Its posterior border is free. It separates the apertures of the posterior nares. Its lateral surfaces present small .grooves for the lodgment of small vessels and nerve filaments, and also a larger groove in which is lodged the naso-palatine nerve. Muscles. The vomer affords attachment to no muscle. Articulations. The vomer articulates with six bones which may be thus clas- sified : Of the Cranium (Mesial).... (2) | ’ Of the Face (2 pairs) (4) j |j££or maxillary‘ Total, 6 These six bones may thus be stated to consist of two mesial bones and two pairs of bones, the former being situated in the cranium and the latter in the face.

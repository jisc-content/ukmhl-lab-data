ANGIOLOGY. 414 PLAN OF THE RELATIONS OF THE PROFUNDA ARTERY. In front. Femoral and profunda veins. Adductor longus. Behind. Iliacus. Adductor brevis. Adductor magnus. The branches of the profunda femoris artery are divided into three sets called respectively the external circumflex, the internal circumflex, and the perforating branches. The external circumflex artery divides into an ascending, de- scending, and transverse branch. These three branches supply anastomotic branches to the knee,, and the muscles on the outer aspect of the thigh. The internal circumflex artery also divides into an ascending, descending, and articular branch. These three branches supply the muscles on the inner aspect of the thigh and the hip-joint. The perforating arteries are usually three in number and are called the superior, middle, and inferior perforating arteries. They supply the muscles at the back part of the thigh. The inferior perforating artery also gives off the nutrient branch of the femur. All the branches of the profunda femoris artery anastomose freely with each other as well as with the vessels of the gluteal region and some of the branches of the popliteal artery. The MUSCULAR BRANCHES of the femoral artery are numerous, and are given off along the entire course of the vessel. The ANASTOMOTICA MAGNA arises from the femoral artery in Hunterâ€™s canal. Its superficial branch accompanies the internal saphenous nerve to the integument of the inner side of the knee; while its deep branch anastomoses with other arteries in front of the knee. Outer side. Vastus internus.

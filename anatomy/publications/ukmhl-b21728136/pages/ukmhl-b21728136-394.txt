ANGIOLOGY. 372 First Portion of the Right Subclavian Artery. The subclavian artery upon the right side commences at the bifurcation of the innominate, opposite to the sterno-clavicular articulation of the right side and terminates at the inner border of the scalenus anticus muscle. In this portion the artery ascends slightly above the clavicle as a rule, although the height of the vessel in the neck varies in different subjects, and lies in a direction which points upwards and outwards, from its seat of origin. In this portion the right subclavian artery presents the follow- ing immediate relation to the important structures which sur- round it. PLAN OF THE RELATIONS OF FIRST PORTION OF RIGHT SUB- CLAVIAN ARTERY. In front. Three muscles. Two veins... Sterno-mastoid (clavicular origin). Stemo-hyoid. Sterno-thyroid. Internal jugular. Vertebral. iPneumogastric. Cardiac. Phrenic. (Recurrent laryngeal. Two nerves -j Sympathetic/ s Longus colli muscle. Transverse process of 7th cervical vertebra. These parts bear also to each other, some special relations, which are of surgical interest. The origins of the sterno-mastoid, sterno-hyoid and sterno-thyroid muscles separate the artery from the superficial structures, which have first to be divided in the operation for ligation of this portion of the artery. These super- ficial structures are the integument, the superficial cervical fascia, the platysma muscle and the deep cervical fascia. The two large veins (internal jugular and vertebral) and the

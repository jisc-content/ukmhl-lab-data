LATERAL REGION OF THE SKULL. ji (3.) The mastoid process of the temporal bone which is situated at the posterior portion of this region. Temporal Fossa. This fossa is formed by parts of the following five bones. (1.) The frontal bone. (2.) The great wing of the sphenoid bone. (3.) The temporal bone. (4.) The anterior inferior angle of the parietal bone. (5.) The malar bone. It is deeply excavated in its anterior and lower portions, but is comparatively shallow in its superior and posterior portions. It is bounded as follows: Above by the -{ Temporal ridge. {Line of the zygomatic arch. Pterygoid ridge upon the greater wing of the Sphenoid bone. ! Malar bone. Frontal bone. Great wing of the Sphenoid. Behind by the â€¢{ Temporal ridge. This fossa is traversed by six sutures, viz. : (1.) The spheno-malar. (2.) The spheno-frontal. (3.) The spheno-parietal. (4.) The squamo-sphenoidal. (5.) The fronto-parietal, or the coronal. (6.) The squamo-parietal. The temporal fossa becomes continuous, at its lower border, viz., at the line of the zygomatic arch and the pterygoid ridge, with the zygomatic fossa. It contains the temporal muscle and the deep temporal vessels. The Temporal fossa is bounded as fol- lows: Zygomatic Fossa.

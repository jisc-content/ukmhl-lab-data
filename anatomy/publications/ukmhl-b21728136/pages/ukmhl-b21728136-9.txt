V PREFACE. The Authors here acknowledge their indebtedness to all of those investigators of Anatomy who have put into print the results of their researches, since it is impossible to depart, in many instances, from methods of arrangements, which have pre- viously been given to the public, or to avoid the free use of much that, in other volumes, seems particularly valuable and worthy of perpetuation.

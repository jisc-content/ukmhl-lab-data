294 MYOLOGY. c. PALMAR GROUP. Lumbricales. Origin. The first and sometimes the second lumbricales arise from the outer side of the corresponding tendon of the flexor profundus digitorum. The third and fourth lumbricales arise, respectively, from adjoining sides of the 2d and 3d, and the 3d and 4th tendons of the deep flexor. Insertion. Into the outer side of the expansions of the corre- sponding extensor tendons on the back surface of the first phalanges. Nervous supply. Branches of the ulnar nerve to the two inner, and of the median nerve to the two outer muscles. Interossei Muscles. The interossei muscles, like the lumbricales, are named in numerical order from the radial towards the ulnar side of the hand. They are seven in number and consist of two sets, viz., a palmar set (3) and a dorsal set (4). A. Palmar Interossei, (Three in number). Origin. From the whole length of one side of a metacarpal bone of one finger. Insertion. Into the same side of the base of the first phalanx of the same finger and into the expansions of the ten- don of the extensor muscle of that finger. Nervous supply. The deep palmar branches of the ulnar nerve. B. Dorsal Interossei, (Four in number). Origin. Each muscle arises by two heads from the adjacent sides of the two metacarpal bones between which it is situated, but most extensively from that one which supports the finger on which the muscle acts.

BONES OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY. 140 muscle, and, at its middle portion, it presents a rough impression for the pronator radii teres muscle. Muscles Attached. The radius affords attachment to nine muscles which may be arranged as follows : To its tubercle (i)-{ Biceps flexor cubiti. To its anterior surf ace.. (2) Flexor sublimis digitorum. Flexor longus pollicis. The Radius affords at- tachment to 9 mus-. cles, as follows: To its posterior surface. (2) Extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis. Extensor primi internodii pollicis. I To its external border... (4) Total, 9 Supinator brevis. Pronator radii teres. Pronator quadratus. Supinator longus. Development. The radius is developed by three centres of ossification: one for the shaft, one for the upper extremity, and one for the lower extremity. The centre for the shaft of the bone appears, near its middle, at about the eighth week of-foetal life. At birth, the ends of the bone are cartilaginous, but the shaft is almost completely ossified. About the end of the second year, the lower epiphysis appears, and about the fifth year of age, the upper epiphysis. The upper epiphysis unites with the shaft at the age of puberty, but the lower epiphysis does not become united until the twentieth year of age. Articulation. The radius articulates with four bones, namely, the humerus, the ulna, the scaphoid, and the semilunar. THE HAND. The bones which compose the hand may be subdivided into three parts, viz., the carpus, the metacarpus, and the digits. The following table will show the situation of the twenty-seven bones which are included in the hand: ‚Äù In proximal row.

JOINTS OF UPPER EXTREMITY. \yy outer surface and the tubercle of the zygoma with the outer surface and the posterior border of the neck of the condyle of the lower jaw. III. The internal lateral ligament, which connects the spinous process of the sphenoid bone to the inner margin of the dental foramen. This ligament bears a close relation to the internal maxillary artery and the inferior dental vessels and nerve. IV. The stylo-maxillary ligament, which connects the apex of the styloid process of the temporal bone to the angle and the posterior border of the ramus of the jaw. It separates the parotid gland from the snbmaxillary gland. F. ARTICULATIONS OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY. The articulations of the upper extremity may be arranged in the following groups : I. Sterno-clavicular articulation. II. Scapulo-clavicular articulation. III. Ligaments of the scapula. IV. Shoulder joint. V. Elbow joint. VI. Radio-ulnar articulations. VII. Wrist joint. VIII. Articulation of the carpal bones. IX. Carpo-metacarpal articulations. X. Metacarpo-phalangeal articulations. XI. Articulations of the phalanges. Sterno-clavicular Articulation. This joint is formed by the articulation of the sternum with the inner extremity of the clavicle. It has two synovial mem- branes, which are situated on either side of an interarticular fibro- cartilage. These two sacs occasionally communicate through an orifice produced by perforation of this cartilage, at its centre. Its ligaments are five in number, as follows: I. The anterior sterno-clavicular ligament, which connects the front of the clavicle to the first piece of the sternum. II. The posterior sterno-clavicular ligament, which connects the back part of the clavicle to the first piece of the sternum.

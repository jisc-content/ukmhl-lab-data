173 ARTICULATIONS OF THE RIBS. I. The interspinous ligaments. These connect the adjacent margins of the adjoin- ing spinous processes of the vertebrae. II. The supraspinous ligament. This ligament extends from the seventh cervical vertebrae to the sacrum. It connects the apices of the spinous processes of the vertebrae. The TRANSVERSE PROCESSES are joined together by ligaments called the iy,ter-transverse ligaments of the vertebral column. They are often insignificant or wanting in the cervical region, and they are attached to the adja- cent margins of the adjoining transverse processes of all the vertebrae. C. ARTICULATIONS OF THE RIBS. The ribs have five distinct points of articulation which may be enumerated as follows: I. Costo-vertebral articulations. II. Costo-transverse articulations. III. Chondro-sternal articulations. IV. Chondro-costal articulations. V. Chondro-chondral articulations. Costo-Vertebral Articulation. These articulations consist of a double arthrodia between the heads of each rib and the bodies of two adjoining vertebrae. The exceptions to this rule exist in the first, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth ribs, which articulate with only one vertebra and there- fore form but a single arthrodial joint. The ligaments of these articulations are three in number, viz.: I. The capsular ligament, which surrounds the articular sur- faces. II. The anterior costo-vertebral ligament, or stellate ligament, consisting of three fasciculi, one joined to the vertebra above, another to the vertebra below, and the middle one to the intervertebral disc between them. III. The inter articular costo-vertebral ligament, which connects the head of the rib to an interveterbral disc of fibro- cartilage. Costo-Transverse Articulation. These articulations are ten in number, are arthrodial in char- acter, and serve to connect the tubercles of the ten upper ribs and

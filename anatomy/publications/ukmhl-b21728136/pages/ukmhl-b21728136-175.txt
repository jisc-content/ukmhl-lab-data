153 THE TIBIA. that upon the external tuberosity is broad and nearly circular. On the upper surface of the tibia, between its two articular surfaces, is a projection of bone called its spinous process, and, behind this process, a rough de- pression for the attachment of the crucial ligaments of the knee-joint. On the anterior aspect of the head of the tibia, be- tween the two tuberosities, is a prominent elevation of bone called the tubercle, for the insertion of the lig- amentum patellae. Posteriorly, the tuberosities are separated by a shal- low notch, called the popliteal notch, which affords attachment for the posterior crucial ligament. Shaft. The shaft of the tibia presents three surfaces: an internal, which is subcutaneous and superficial; an ex- ternal, which is concave and marked by a sharp ridge for the insertion of the interosseous membrane, and a posterior, which is grooved for the insertion of muscles. Upon the posterior surface, near the upper extremity of the bone, is an oblique ridge called the popliteal line, which affords attachment to the fascia of the popliteus muscle, and, below this line, the orifice of the nutrient canal is perceived, which is directed downwards. Lower Extremity. This portion of the tibia is prolonged, on its inner side, into a large process, called the internal malleolus. Upon the outer side, the lower extremity of the tibia is concave and triangular in form. It articulates, on its outer surface, with the other bone of the leg, viz., the fibula, and, at its extremity, with the astragalus, one of the bones of the tarsus. Muscles Attached to Tibia. The muscles attached to the tibia are fourteen in number. They may be thus classified :

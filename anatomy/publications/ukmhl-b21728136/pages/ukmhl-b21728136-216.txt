ARTHROLOGY OR SYNDESMOLOGY. i94 A swelling in the popliteal space, often as large as a hen’s egg, is produced by the enlargement of the popliteal bursa. As this bursa not infrequently communicates with the synovial membrane of the knee-joint, surgical interference is not without danger. Tibio-Fibular Articulations. The tibia articulates with the fibula at its superior, its middle, and its inferior portions. ’ Superior articulation. This is an arthrodial joint, whose synovial membrane is sometimes continuous with that of the knee. Its ligaments are two in number, as follows : 1. The anterior superior tibio fibular ligament, which connects the front of the head of the fibula with the outer tuberosity of the tibia. It consists of two or three broad and flat bands, which pass obliquely upwards and inwards. 2. The posterior superior tibio-fibular ligament, which connects the back of the head of the fibula with the outer tuberosity. It is a single broad band and is covered by the tendon of the popliteus muscle. A synovial membrane lines this joint, which often communicates with the synovial mem- brane of the knee-joint of the tibia. Middle articulation. These bones are joined, in the region of their shafts, by an interosseous membrane which connects the con- tiguous borders of the tibia and the fibula. This membrane is perforated, high up, for the passage of the anterior tibial vessels, and, below, for the passage of the anterior peroneal vessel. Inferior articulation. This is a amphi-arthrodial joint, the two bones being flat, smooth, and covered with cartilage, below, to the extent of about two lines. The ligaments of this articulation are four in number, as follows : I. The anterior inferior tibio-fibular ligament, which connects the front portion of the external malleolus with the front portion of the lower end of the tibia. This ligament is flat and triangular in form, its broadest part being below. It lies in contact with the cartilage cover- ing the astragalus.

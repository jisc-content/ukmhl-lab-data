THE PERINEUM. 597 THE PERINEUM. That portion of the outlet of the pelvis, which lies anterior to the line drawn between the two tuberosities of the ischia, is called the perineum, while the portion, which lies posterior to this line, is called the ischio-rectal fossa. The structures which compose the perineum differ in the two sexes, but, as the male perineum is the chief seat of operation for stone in the bladder and for surgical conditions of the deep urethra, and therefore possesses great surgical importance, the following text will be specially understood to apply to that sex, unless the female perineum be specially mentioned. The perineal space is triangular in shape, and is bounded as follows : Anteriorly, by the symphysis pubis. Laterally, by the rami of the pubes and the ischia. Posteriorly, by the line between the tuberosities of the ischia. The average width of the perineum is about two and three- quarter inches, and the variations from this standard are of im- portance in the operation of lithotomy. The cutaneous surface of the perineum is convex, in the me- dian line, and slightly depressed at its outer borders. The perineum is composed of the following structures, each of which merits a special description. The integument. {Sphincter ani. Levator ani. Coccygeus.

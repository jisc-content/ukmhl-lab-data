412 ANGIOLOGY. G. ARTERIES OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY. The arteries of the lower extremity are principally derived from the femoral artery, although some of the branches of the internal iliac are distributed to the gluteal region of the hip. FEMORAL ARTERY. This artery commences beneath Poupart's ligament, being a direct continuation of the external iliac, and, passing down the front and the inner side of the thigh, terminates at the junction of the middle and lower third of the thigh, at an opening in the lower part of the adductor magnus muscle. It here becomes the popliteal artery. This artery is, at first, contained in a space called Scarpa s tri- angle ; and, in the middle third of the thigh, in a canal, called Hunter’s canal, between the vastus internus and the tendons of the adductor longus and the adductor magnus muscles. The following table illustrates the branches of the femoral artery. A Table of the Branches of the Femoral Artery. f Superficial epigastric. Superficial circumflex iliac. Superficial external pudic.

Scarpa’s triangle is bounded as follows: Above, by Poupart’s ligament; internally, by the adductor longus muscle; externally, by the sartorius muscle. The floor of this space is formed, from without inwards, by the iliacus, psoas, pectineus, adductor longus, and a part of the adductor brevis muscles. This triangle con- tains, i. The femoral artery, which runs from its base to its apex ; 2. The femoral vein, which, at the upper part of the triangle,

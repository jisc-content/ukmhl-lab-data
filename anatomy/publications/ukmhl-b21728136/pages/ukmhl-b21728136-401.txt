SUBCLA VIAN ARTERY. 379 A. When the first portion is tied. The subclavian artery receives blood from the circle of Willis through the vertebral artery. The subclavian artery receives blood from the carotid through the superior thyroid artery. The subclavian artery receives blood from the carotid through the princeps cervicis artery. The subclavian artery receives blood from the thoracic aorta through the posterior in- tercostals. The subclavian artery receives blood from the external iliac through the deep epigastric artery. B. When the second or third portions are tied. The supra scapular (branch of thyroid axis) anastomoses with acromio-thoracic (branch of axillary). The supra scapular (branch of thyroid axis) anastomoses with dorsalis scapulce (branch of subscapular). The posterior scapular (branch of the subclavian or the transversalis colli) anastomoses with subscapular (branch of axillary). The posterior scapular (branch of the subclavian or the transversalis colli) anastomoses with dorsalis scapidce (branch of subscapular). The internal mammary (branch of subclavian) anastomoses with short thoracic (branch of subscapular). The internal mammary (branch of subclavian) anastomoses with long thoracic (branch of subscapular). The posterior intercostals (branch of thoracic aorta) anastomoses with thoracic branches of the axillary. BRANCHES OF THE SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY. From the subclavian artery, four vessels spring as direct branches, although there are seven important arterial trunks, which directly and indirectly arise from this source, and which' require description. The following table illustrates not only the four principal trunks which arise, but also the distribution of their various branches.

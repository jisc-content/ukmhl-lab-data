570 THE PRO ST A TE GLAND. THE PROSTATE GLAND. The prostate gland encircles the neck of the bladder of the male, and measures one and one-quarter to one and one-half inches in its antero-posterior diameter, one and three-quarter inches in its greatest transverse diameter, and about three-quar- ters of an inch in depth. It is of a pale color, and consists, to a great extent, of involuntary muscular tissue, the glandular portion being decidedly subordinate to the muscular element. Its ducts open into the prostatic portion of the urethra, and its secretion serves to dilute the semen. This gland consists of two lateral lobes of large size, and, in the deep notch between them at its posterior part, of a small tri- angular mass, to which the name “ middle lobe of the prostate ” is applied. The size of the prostate gland, especially of its middle lobe, varies; since, as life advances, the gland tends to increase in size, on account of hypertrophy of its structures. The prostate gland is enveloped in a fibrous capsule, which is derived from the pelvic and the deep perineal fasciae. The arteries, which are distributed to this gland, are derived from the internal pudic, the vesical arteries, and the middle hem- orrhoidal artery. The veins form large plexuses at the sides and the base of the gland, and empty into the internal iliac vein. The nerves are derived from the hypogastric plexus of the sympathetic system. The various points of interest, contained within the internal cavity of the gland, have already been described as pertaining to the prostatic portion of the urethral canal. The prostate gland lies in close relation with the rectum. An invaluable means of diagnosis, in case of disease of this gland, is thus afforded by rectal touch. The posterior edge of this gland is used as a guide, in puncture of the bladder through the rectum.

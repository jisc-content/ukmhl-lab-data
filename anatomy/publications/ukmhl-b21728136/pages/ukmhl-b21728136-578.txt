550 ORGAN OF RESPIRA TION. These relations are the same upon each side of the body, and may be, perhaps, more easily remembered by the initial letters of the more important structures, viz., V. A. B. B. From above, downwards. {Bronchus. Pulmonary artery. Pulmonary veins. {Pulmonary artery. Bronchus, Pulmonary veins. It will thus be perceived that the relations from above, downwards differ on the two sides of the body and may be represented by the initial letters of B. A. V. and A. B. V. This difference is produced by the obliquity of the left bronchus, which falls below the level of the artery upon the left side of the body. The root of the right lung lies posteriorly to the superior vena cava and the right auricle of the heart, and the vena azygos major arches over it from behind forwards. The root of the left lung passes beneath the arch of the aorta, and in front of the descending portion of the arch, the oesophagus^ and the thoracic duct. The root of each lung has also in front of it the phrenic nerve, and behind it the pneumogastric nerve. STRUCTURE OF THE LUNG. The intimate structures of the lungs may be grouped under three main divisions, viz.: The parenchyma. The serous coat or the pleura. The subserous areolar tissue. Parenchyma of the Lungs. The parenchyma, or the true structure of the lungs, embraces the following structures: i. Bronchial tubes. 2. The lobules of the lung. 3. The pulmonary vessels. 4. The bronchial vessels. 5. The lymphatic vessels. 6. The nerves of the lung. 7. The connective tissue between the lobules.

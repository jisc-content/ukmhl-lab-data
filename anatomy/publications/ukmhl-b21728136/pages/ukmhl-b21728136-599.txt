571 THE SPERM A TIC CORD. THE SPERMATIC CORD. The spermatic cord extends from the globus minor of the epi- didymis to the internal abdominal ring. It is about four inches in length, and is composed of the following structures: 1. The vas deferens. 2. Spermatic artery. 3. Cremasteric artery. 4. Artery of the vas deferens. 5. Spermatic veins. 6. Spermatic plexus of nerves. 7. A branch of the ilio-inguinal nerve. 8. A branch of the genito-crural nerve. 9. Vas aberrans of Haller. 10. Coverings. 11. Lymphatics. Of these various structures, the vas deferens lies at the pos- terior portion of the cord, while the veins form a plexus both in and upon it, and are sometimes called the pampiniform plexus. The vas aberrans of Haller is a narrow and tortuous tube, which arises either from the vas deferens or from the canal of the epididymis. It passes upwards in the spermatic cord, where it usually ends in a blind extremity. It varies in its length from two to fourteen inches. The coverings of the spermatic cord differ in the various parts of its course. Two coverings, viz., the fascia propria of the tes- ticle and spermatic cord, and the cremasteric fascia, invest it for the greater portion of its length ; while, below the external abdominal ring, the tunica vdginalis, the intercolumnar fascia, the dartos, and the integument also protect and partially cover it. All the parts, which enter into the formation of the spermatic cord, are bound together by a delicate areolar tissue.

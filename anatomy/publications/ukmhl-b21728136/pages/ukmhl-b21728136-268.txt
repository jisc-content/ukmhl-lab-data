MYOLOGY. 246 Insertion. Into the inner surfaces of the first, second and third ribs below. Nervous supply. The intercostal nerves. The direction of these muscles is usually parallel to that of the internal intercostals and they are most frequent on the lower ribs. Levatores COSTARUM, (twelve on each side). Origin. From the extremities of the transverse processes of dorsal vertebrae. Insertion. Into the upper rough surface of the rib next below, between its tubercle and its angle. Nervous supply. The intercostal nerves. The muscle for the 1st rib arises from the 7th cervical verte- bra. The muscle for the 12th rib arises from the nth dorsal vertebra. Frequently an inferior fasciculus of these muscles is carried to the second rib below the point of origin. Triangularis Sterni. Origin. 1. From the lower part of the side of the sternum. 2. From the inner surface of the ensiform cartilage. 3. From the costal cartilages of the four lower true ribs. Insertion. Into the lower border and inner surface of the costal cartilages of the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th ribs. Nervous supply. The intercostal nerves. Its lowest fibres are continuous with those of the transversalis abdominis muscle. Diaphragm. This muscle forms the dividing septum between the cavities of the thorax and abdomen. It is formed like a dome during its passive condition, as its central tendon is situated much higher than its circumferential attachment, but, during its contraction, it is more nearly a flat plane. It is the most important muscle of inspiration, and it is per

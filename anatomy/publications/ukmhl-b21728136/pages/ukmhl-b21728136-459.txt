NEUROLOGY. Nerve tissue consists of two varieties, viz., grey and white matter. The grey matter is found principally in the nerve centres and in the various ganglia. By some anatomists the nerve tissue, found in the sympathetic system of nerves, is considered as a separate form, and is called gelatinous nerve tissue. The grey nerve tissue is often called the vesicular nervous sub- stance, as it consists of vesicles, called nerve corpuscles, imbedded in a fine granular substance. The white nerve tissue is also called the fibrous or tubular nerve substance, since it exists in the form of nerve fibres. Each nerve is a bundle of nerve fibres bound together in a sheath, formed of connective tissue and called the perineurium. Each of the primitive nerve fibres are also enclosed in a sheath, which is more delicate than the perineurium and which is termed the neurilemma or epineurium. Nerves are divided, on a basis of their distribution, into those of animal life and those of organic life. The former subserve the higher functions of special sense, volition, sensation, etc.; while the latter control nutrition and growth. The nervous system of animal life consists of two principal parts, as follows : 1. A central portion, called the CEREBRO-SPINAL AXIS. 2. A peripheral portion, called NERVES, GANGLIA, ETC. CEREBRO-SPINAL AXIS. This portion of the nervous system is, conventionally, divided into five parts, namely: The Cerebrum. The Cerebellum. The Pons Varolii. The Medulla Oblongata. The Spinal Cord. Of these five parts, which make up the cerebro-spinal axis, the first four are contained within the cavity of the cranium, viz. : the cerebrum, cerebellum, pons Varolii, and medulla oblongata ; and, when taken collectively, are called the encephalon or brain. The encephalon extends to the upper border of the atlas or 1st

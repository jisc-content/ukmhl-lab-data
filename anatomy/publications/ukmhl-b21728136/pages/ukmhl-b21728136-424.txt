The abdominal aorta divides into its two terminal branches, the two common iliac arteries, opposite a point situated on the exterior of the abdomen at about one inch and a half below the umbilicus. This point also corresponds to the level of the highest part of the crest of the ilium. The abdominal aorta can be compressed with the least danger to surrounding tissues and with the greatest ease, at a point situ- ated one inch below and slightly to the left of the umbilicus, since at this point the aorta approaches nearest to the anterior wall of the abdomen. Branches. The branches of the abdominal aorta are twenty in number. The following table shows the order in which these branches are given off and also the branches of distribution of each.

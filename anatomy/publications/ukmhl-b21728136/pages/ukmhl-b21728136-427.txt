ARTERIES OF THE PELVIS. 405 The inferior mesenteric artery arises from the left side of the aorta, about two inches above bifurcation. Its three branches are distributed to the descending and sigmoid flexure of the colon and the rectum. The lumbar arteries are four in number upon either side, and arise from the back part of the abdominal aorta. They are dis- tributed to the parietes of the abdominal cavity. The middle sacral artery arises from the abdominal aorta, at its point of bifurcation, and passes, down into the pelvis, upon the middle of the sacrum. It affords a point of anastomosis, in case of ligature of the common iliacs, with the lateral sacral arteries. COLLATERAL CIRCULATION. The collateral circulation, in case the abdominal aorta be tied, varies with the sit- uation of the ligature. It is chiefly performed however by the anastomoses between the following vessels. Internal mammary (branch of subclavian) with the deep epigastric (a branch of external iliac). Lumbar arteries (branches of aorta) with ilio-lumbar (branch of internal iliac). Branches of the superior mesenteric with branches of the inferior mesenteric. Branches of inferior mesenteric with branches of the internalpudic. ARTERIES OF THE PELVIS. The arteries of the pelvis, as enumerated in the following table, are derived from the trunks of the two common iliac arter- ies, which are the branches of bifurcation of the abdominal aorta.

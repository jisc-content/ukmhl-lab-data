83 REGIONAL CHARACTERISTICS OF VERTEBRAE. Are situated outside of the pedicle. Lie in front of the articular process. ARTICULAR PROCESSES. The two superior look upwards and backwards. The two inferior looks downwards and forwards. The distinctive characteristic of a cervical vertebra is the pres- ence of a foramen at the base of the transverse process, called the vertebral foramen, since it transmits the vertebral artery and vein and the vertebral plexus of the sympathetic system of nerves. Each transverse process of the cervical vertebra is formed by two roots; the anterior root arises from the sides of the body and corresponds to the ribs which spring from the dorsal vertebra; the posterior root arises from the junction of the pedicle with the lamina and corresponds to the transverse process of the dorsal region. The extremities of these two roots produce the bifid appear- ance of the transverse process of the cervical vertebra and form the so-called anterior and posterior tubercles of these processes, to which many of the muscles of the neck are attached. Body. Pedicles. Notches. Laminae. Dorsal Vertebrae. The dorsal vertebrae are of intermediate size, being larger than those of the cervical and smaller than those of the lumbar region. Their distinguishing characteristics may be thus enumerated. Is heart-shaped. Is thicker behind than in front. Has two demi-facets on each side, for the articu- lation of the head of the ribs. These arise from the upper part of the body. The inferior notches are the broadest and deepest. The laminae are short and broad. Spinal Foramen. The spinal opening is small and round. SPINOUS PROCESS. This process is long, triangular and oblique in its direction. Transverse processes. These processes are long and thick. They are directed obliquely out- wards and backwards. They are situated behind the ar- ticular processes. They are situated also behind the pedicles. Their extremity is enlarged and

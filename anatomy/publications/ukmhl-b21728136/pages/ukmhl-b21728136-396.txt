ANGIOLOGY. 374 PLAN OF THE RELATIONS OF FIRST PORTION OF LEFT SUB- CLAVIAN ARTERY. In front. Innner side. CEsophagus. Trachea. Thoracic duct. Three muscles.. Two veins. tSterno-mastoid. Sterno-hyoid.

Longus colli muscle. Inferior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic system. The pneumogastric, phrenic and cardiac nerves lie almost par- allel with, and in front of the artery. The pleura of the left lung invests it on its anterior and lateral wall forming a depression in which it rests. The three muscles of the sternal region separate it, as on the opposite side, from the integument, the superficial cervical fascia, the platysma muscle and the deep cervical fascia. The artery, from its deep situation within the chest, also gains relations, posteriorly, with the oesophagus, thoracic duct, verte- bral column and its longus colli muscle, and the inferior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic nervous system; while, to its inner side, the trachea, oesophagus and thoracic duct also bear an in- timate relation. In order to assist the memory of students in the anatomy of this actery^by the aid of contrast, the following arrangement of these relations and other points of interest, pertaining to the first portion of the subclavian artery of the right and the left side # may prove of value.

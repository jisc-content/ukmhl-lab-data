127 THE HUMERUS. a facet for the first rib, which is situated at the inner extremity of the inferior surface of the bone. The circumference of the end of the bone is roughened for the anterior and posterior sterno- clavicular ligaments and for the interclavicular ligament. Outer or Acromial End. This end of the clavicle is flattened, from above downwards. It presents a small oval facet, which looks downwards and out- wards, and which articulates with the acromion process of the scapula. The circumference of this end of the bone is roughened for the insertion of the superior and inferior acromio-clavicular ligaments. Muscles attached. The muscles attached to the clavicle or collar bone are six in number. These muscles will be found enumerated in the follow- ing table: ' To the anterior surface... (2) { â€œJ0R' To the posterior surface... (2) j To the lower surface (i) *{ Subclavius. b To the external extremity, (i) Sterno-hyoid. Total, 6 Occasionally a few fibres of the platysma muscle arise from this bone. Development. The clavicle begins to ossify sooner than any other bone of the body. It is formed from two separate centres, the one for the shaft and acromial end appearing about the sixth week of foetal life, the other for the sternal extremity makes its appear- ance as an epiphysis, about the 18th or 20th year after birth. The epiphysis is united to the shaft at about the 25th year. Articulation. The clavicle articulates with two bones, viz., the sternum and the scapula, and occasionally with the cartilage of the first rib. THE HUMERUS. The humerus or arm bone, is the longest and largest bone of the upper extremity. It presents for examination an upper and a lower extremity and a shaft. Each of these portions will be separately considered. The Clavicle affords at- tachment to 6 muscles, as follows:

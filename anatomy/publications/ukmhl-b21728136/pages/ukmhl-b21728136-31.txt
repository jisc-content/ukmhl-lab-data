Upon almost every bone in the human skeleton are to be seen various prominences and depressions. These prominences and depressions, although they may often appear to the student but trivial and possibly accidental in their character, are nevertheless important, and each one is usually designated with some special name, which is supposed to indicate either its location, its general

539 MUSCLES OF LAR YNX. The CUNEIFORM CARTILAGES or CARTILAGES of WRISBERG are two small rods of yellow elastic cartilage which are contained in the free border of the aryteno-epiglottidean folds. The EPIGLOTTIS is a flat lamella of yellow elastic cartilage, which resembles a leaf in shape, and which is connected, at its pointed extremity, with the angle of the thyroid cartilage and with the base of the tongue and the hyoid bone. It presents for examination an apex, a base, an anterior surface, a posterior surface, and two lateral margins. The apex is attached to the angle of the thyroid cartilage by the.thyro-epiglottidean ligament. The base is unattached, and is broad and rounded. The anterior surface is attached, at its lower part, to the hyoid bone, by the hyo-epiglottic ligament; and, higher up, to the tongue, by the three glosso-epiglottidean folds. Its upper part is unattached and curves over the base of the tongue. The posterior surface covers the superior aperture of the larnyx, when the bolus of food is passing through the pharynx. It presents numerous small depressions, in which are lodged mucous glands. The lateral margins are connected to the arytenoid cartilages by the aryteno-epiglottidean folds. Muscles. The muscles of the larynx are divided into two sets as fol- lows : Muscles of the glottis. Crico-thyroid. Thyro-arytenoid. Crico-arytenoid lateralis. Crico-arytenoideus posticus. Arytenoideus. ORIGIN AND INSERTION. Crico-Thyroid. Origin. From the front and sides of the cricoid cartilage. Insertion. Into the lower border and inferior cornua of thyroid cartilage. Nervous supply. The superior laryngeal nerve. Muscles of the epiglottis. Thyro-epiglottideus. Aryteno-epiglottideus inferior. Ayrteno-epiglottideus superior.

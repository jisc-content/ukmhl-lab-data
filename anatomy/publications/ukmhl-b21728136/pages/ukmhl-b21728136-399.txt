Compression of the subclavian artery must be performed at its point of crossing the first rib, and the pressure must be directed downwards and inwards to prove effectual. Of the numerous structures, which lie in front of the artery, the integument, cervical fasciae and the platysma muscle lie su- perficially and the nerve filaments of the cervical plexus ramify subcutaneously. At the inner side of the artery, the external jugular vein crosses it, and also, at about the same point, the supra-scapular and the transverse cervical veins, which often form a plexus in front of the artery. The subclavian vein lies on a plane below the level of the artery and close behind the clavicle. The brachial plexus of nerves lies above and to the outer side of the artery. The first rib, over which the artery passes lies below it and a small nerve supplying the subclavius muscle can usually be perceived crossing this portion of the artery. Collateral Circulation. After direct communication between the head and the axillary artery is cut off, by the application of a ligature to the subclavian artery, the supply of blood to the arm is obtained by anastomoses between certain vessels carrying blood derived from the subclavian and arterial branches deriving their supply from other sources.

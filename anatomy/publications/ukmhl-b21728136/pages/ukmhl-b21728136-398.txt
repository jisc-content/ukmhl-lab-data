ANGIOLOGY. 376 PLAN OF THE RELATIONS OF SECOND PORTION OF THE SUB- CLAVIAN ARTERIES. In front. I Muscle.. Scalenus anticus. I Nerve... Phrenic, i Vein.... \ Subclavian. Above. Brachial plexus of nerves. % Behind. Scalenus medius muscle. Pleura. The three structures, mentioned as in front, are situated be- neath the superficial layers of the neck, viz., the integument, the superficial cervical fascia, the platysma muscle and the deep cer- vical fascia. The phrenic nerve and the subclavian vein lie upon the anterior surface of the scalenus anticus muscle and therefore do not actually touch the artery. The vein, however, is nearer the line of the clavicle than the artery at this point. Behind the artery, the scalenus medius muscle is in the closest relation and the brachial plexus of nerves, which passes between the same muscles as the artery, lies above that vessel and situated closely to it. Below the artery, the apex of the lung and its pleural covering lie in close relation. THIRD PORTION OF SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY. The third portion of the subclavian artery passes, in a direc- tion downwards and outwards, from the external border of the scalenus anticus muscle to the lower border of the first rib, where it becomes the axillary artery. In this part of its course, the artery lies in a small triangular space, the sides of which are formed by the scalenus anticus and the omo-hyoid muscles, and its base by the clavicle. It is within this triangle that the artery approaches nearer to the surface of the neck than in any portion of its course, although the artery, as it approaches its termination, sinks deeper and passes under the clavicle and the subclavius muscle. Its relations within this space will be found tabulated below.

ARTERIAL SUPPLY OF SPECIAL REGIONS OF THE HEAD AND NECK. In recapitulation of the arteries, derived from the principal vascular trunks of the head and neck, it may be of service to the student to present, in a tabulated form, the various sources of vas- cular supply to special structures, which have at times great sur- gical interest. Vascular Supply of the Meninges of the Brain. The meninges of the brain and spinal cord receive arterial blood from the following sources. 1. Anterior meningeal artery (branch of the internal carotid). 2. Middle meningeal artery (branch of the internal maxillary). 3. Small meningeal artery (branch of the internal maxillary). 4. Posterior meningeal artery (branch of the vertebral artery). 5. Inferior meningeal artery (branch of the occipital artery). 6. Small branches, which are not specially named but which are still distributed to the meninges. Among these the more important ones are, Branches from the ascending pharangeal arteries. Branches from the lachrymal arteries. Branches from the posterior ethmoidal arteries. Branches from the anterior ethmoidal arteries. Branches from the vertebral artery. Of these branches the anterior meningeal artery and the men- ingeal branches of the two ethmoidal and lachrymal arteries sup- ply the anterior fossa of the skull; the middle and small menin- geal and some branches of the ascending pharangeal, which enter the skull at the foramen lacerum basis cranii, supply the middle fossa; while the posterior fossa of the skull is supplied by the posterior and inferior meningeal arteries, and branches of the ascending pharangeal, which enter the cavity of the cranium through the jugular and the anterior condyloid foramina.

PALA TE BONE. 53 (6) The borders, of the malar bone. The antero-superior border forms the lower and outer portion of the circumference of the orbit. The antero-inferior border articulates with the superior max- illary bone, upon the cheek. The postero-superior border and the postero-inferior borders of the malar bone are continuous, respectively, with the superior and the inferior margins of the zygomatic process of the malar bone. Muscles of the Malar Bone. This bone affords attachment to five muscles as follows: (i.) The levator labii superioris proprius. (2.) The zygomaticus major. (3.) The zygomaticus minor. (4.) The masseter. (5.) The temporal. Articulations. The malar bone articulates with four bones which may be thus enumerated : The Malar Bone articulates with four bones, viz.: Of the Cranium, (3.) Of the Face, (1.) f Frontal. â– < Sphenoid. ( Temporal. -{ Superior maxillary. Development. Total, 4 The malar bone develops by a single centre of ossification, which appears at about the 8th to 10th week of foetal life. THE PALATE BONES. This bone presents for examination the following component parts: A. Horizontal plate. B. Vertical plate. C. Pterygoid process. D. Orbital process. E. Sphenoidal process. The palate bones assist in forming the following parts: (1.) The outer wall and floor of the nasal fossa, (2.) the roof of the mouth, (3.) the floor of the orbit, (4.) the pterygoid, and spheno- maxillary fossa, (5.) the inner wall of the antrum. A. The Horizontal Plate. This portion of the bone enters into the construction of the roof of the mouth, and the floor of the nose.

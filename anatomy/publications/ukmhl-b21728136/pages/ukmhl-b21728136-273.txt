251 MUSCLES OF THE BACK. ACTION OF THE SUPERFICIAL LAYER. The action of these muscles is demanded in various move- ments of the head, scapula, and the humerus. If the head be made a fixed point, the trapezius muscle helps, through its upper fibres, to elevate the point of the shoulder, as in the acts of sup- porting weights, shrugging the shoulders, etc., while, by means of its middle and lower fibres, a partial rotation of the scapula upon the side of the chest is produced. When the shoulders are fixed, both of the trapezii muscles, if acting together, will draw the head directly backwards, or, if only one act, the head will be drawn towards the corresponding side. The latissimus dorsi, if the trunk be the fixed point, acts upon the arm and draws it downwards and backwards and subsequently rotates the arm inwards, as in the act of scratching the gluteal region. If this muscle acts in connection with the pectoralis major and the teres major muscles, the arm is adducted and ap- proximated to the chest wall. If the arms be made a fixed point, the latissimus dorsi muscle may assist in forcible inspiration by elevating the lower ribs (as is illustrated in the attitude assumed by asthmatic patients) ; or if it acts in connection with the pectoral and abdominal muscles, while the arms are made a point of resist- ance, the whole trunk may be drawn forward or upward, as is illus- trated in the acts of climbing or walking upon crutches. SECOND LAYER. (3 muscles.) Levator Anguli Scapulae. Origin. From the posterior tubercles of the transverse pro- cesses of the three or four upper cervical vertebrae. Insertion. Into the base of the scapula, from its spine to the superior angle. Nervous supply. The 5th cervical nerve and deep branches from the cervical plexus. Rhomboideus Minor. Origin. From the ligamentum nuchae and the spinous pro- cesses of the 7th cervical and the first dorsal vertebrae.

BONES OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY. 142 trapezoid, the metacarpal bone of the thumb and the second metacarpal bone. The TRAPEZOID BONE is Small, oblong and quadrilateral. It is bent upon itself near its middle portion and possesses four ar- ticular surfaces and two non-articular, one of which is large and broad and is called the dorsal, the other is small and rough and is called the palmar. It articulates with four bones, viz., the scaphoid, the trapezium, the os magnum and the second metacarpal bone. The OS MAGNUM possesses six surfaces, viz., an anterior, pos- terior, superior, inferior, external, and internal. It is sometimes subdivided into a head, neck, and body. It is the largest bone of the carpus and is sometimes dislocated, when it appears as a tumor on the dorsal aspect of the hand in the line of the metacarpal bone of the middle finger. It articulates with seven bones, viz., the scap- hoid, semilunar, trapezoid, unciform, and the second, third, and fourth metacarpal bones. The UNCIFORM BONE is triangular and is remarkable for a long and curved process which projects from its palmar aspect. It possesses five surfaces, three of which are articular and two free. It articulates with five bones, viz., the semilunar, the cuneiform, the os magnum, and the fourth and fifth metacarpal bones. Articulation of the Carpus. The following diagram illustrates the various articulations of each of the eight carpal bones.

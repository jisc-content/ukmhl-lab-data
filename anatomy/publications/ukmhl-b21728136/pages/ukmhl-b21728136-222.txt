ARTHR0L0GY OR SYNDESM0L0GY. 200 The outer malleolus descends lower than the inner, and thus locks the joint upon its outer side. The inner malleolus advances more to the front, but, being broader than the outer malleolus, its posterior border corresponds with that of the outer. In Symeâ€™s amputation, the incision should therefore run from the apex of the outer malleolus to the middle point of the inner. A valuable guide in adjusting a fracture of the lower extremity below the knee joint, may be afforded, by remembering that the inner edge of the patella, the inner malleolus, and the inner border of the large toe should be in the same vertical plane, provided that the leg be well formed. The tubercle of the scaphoid bone is the surgical guide to the astragalo-scaphoid articulation, and is, therefore, on the line of the amputation of Chopart. The point of articulation between the internal cuneiform bone and the metatarsal bone of the great toe lies about one a?id a half inches in front of the tubercle of the scaphoid bone. The calcaneo-scaphoid ligament forms a portion of the recepta- cle or socket into which the scaphoid bone is placed. The articulation between the os calcis and the cuboid bone lies midway between the tip of the external malleolus and the tarsal extremity of the 5 th metatarsal bone. The projection of the fifth metatarsal bone is the guide to the articulation of that bone with the cuboid. In amputating the toes from the metatarsal bones, it should be remembered that the folds of skin, between the toes, lie one inch in front of the articulation. The power of producing adduction of the foot, which is pos- sessed by the tendo Achillis, depends upon the peculiar confor- mation of the articulating surfaces between the os calcis and the astragalus.

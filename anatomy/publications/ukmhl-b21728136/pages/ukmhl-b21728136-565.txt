537 CARTILAGES OF LARYNX. THE LARYNX. The larynx is the essential organ of voice. It is composed of cartilages, united by ligaments, moved by muscles, lined with a mucous membrane, and supplied by vessels and nerves. Cartilages. The cartilages which compose the larynx are nine in number, three single and three pairs. Single cartilages. Thyroid cartilage. Cricoid cartilage. Epiglottis. Pairs of cartilages. Arytenoid cartilages. Cuneiform cartilages. Cornicula laryngis. The THYROID CARTILAGE resembles a shield in form and is composed of two quadrilateral plates or alee, joined together, in front, at an acute angle; the highest part of which junction is called the pomum Adami. To its outer surface, are attached three muscles, viz., the sterno- thyroid, the thyro-hyoid, and the inferior constrictor muscles. To its inner surf ace, are attached the true and false vocal cords, the apex of the epiglottis, the thyro-epiglottic ligament, and the thyro-arytenoid and the thyro-epiglottidei muscles. It is covered by mucous membrane. To its upper border, which is irregularly curved, is attached the thyro-hyoid membrane. To the lower border, which is shorter and less curved than the upper, is attached the crico-thyroid membrane and the crico-thy- roid muscle. Thz posterior border of each ala affords attachment to the stylo- pharyngeus and the palato-pharyngeus muscles. Its upper and lower extremities are called the superior cornu and the inferior cornu. The superior cornu affords attachment to the thyro-hyoid lig- ament. The inferior cornu articulates with the cricoid cartilage and thus affords a point of motion between the thyroid and cricoid car- tilages. This capability of motion allows of the relaxation and tightening of the vocal cords, when the crico-thyroid muscles act. The CRICOID CARTILAGE is shaped like a ring, and is broad be- hind and narrow in front. It is thicker and stronger than any of the cartilages-of the larynx.

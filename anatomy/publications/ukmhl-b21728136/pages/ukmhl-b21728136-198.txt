176 ARTHROLOGY OR SYNDESMOLOGY. II. The posterior pubic ligament, which connects the posterior surfaces of the two pubic bones. III. The supra-pubic ligament, which joins the upper border of the pubic bones. IV. The sub-pubic ligament, which forms a fibrous arch be- tween the rami of the pubic bones. An inter articular jibro-cartilage exists between the bones forming this joint. Sacro-Coccygeal Articulation. This articulation is similar to those between the bodies of the vertebrae. It posesses three ligaments as follows: I. The anterior sacro-coccygeal ligament, which connects the front of the sacrum to the front of the coccyx. II. The posterior sacro-coccygeal ligament, which connects the margins of the lower orifice of the sacral canal to the back of the coccyx. An interarticular jibro-cartilage exists also in this joint. Sacro-Vertebral Articulation. This articulation is similar to other vertebral articulations ex- cept that it has two additional ligaments, viz. .* I. The lumbo-sacral ligament (sacro-vertebral), which connects the fifth lumbar vertebrae, in front, to the sides of the base of the sacrum. II. The ilio-lumbar ligament (lumbo-iliac), which connects the tip of the transverse process of the fifth lumbar verte- brae to the crest of the ilium. E. TEMPORO-MAXILLARY ARTICULATION. This joint is a double arthrodial articulation, existing between the condyles of the lower jaw, on the one hand, and the anterior part of each glenoid cavity, on the other. It has two synovial membranes, which are separated by an interarticular jibro-cartilage, and which occasionally com- municate. It has four ligaments, which are as follows : I. The capsiilar ligament, which connects the circumfer- ence of the glenoid cavity of the temporal bone and the eminentia articularis, with the neck of the condyle of the jaw. II. The external lateral ligament, which connects the

THE MOUTH. 5*5 The alimentary canal may be again divided into two parts, as follows. 1. The part located above the diaphragm, which may be called the supra-diaphragmatic portion. 2. The part situated below the diaphragm, which may be called the infra-diaphragmatic portion. Each of these portions may be subdivided into three parts, as is indicated below. {Mouth (oral, or buccal cavity). Pharynx. (Esophagus or gullet. Infra-diaphragmatic portion... r Stomach. {Duodenum. Jejunum. Ileum. ( Caecum. Large intestine. â€¢< Colon ( Rectum. The supra-diaphragmatic portion is ingestive in function, and has as appendages, the tonsils, the parotid, the submaxillary, and sublingual glands. The infra-diaphragmatic portion is digestive and egestive in function, and has as appendages, the liver, the spleen, and the pancreas. The first two organs contained in this portion, viz., the stomach and the small intestine, comprise the digestive apparatus, while the remaining portion, the large intestine, comprises the egestive apparatus. When the intestinal canal is spoken of, it designates that por- tion of the alimentary canal, which extends from the pyloric ori- fice of the stomach to the anus. THE MOUTH. The buccal cavity, which is the superior portion of the ali- mentary canal, contains, for special examination, the following parts: 1. The tonsils. 2. The tongue. 3. The salivary glands. The bony structures which enter into the formation of the mouth, with the exception of the teeth, which will not be con sidered in this volume, have already been described in the chap- ter on osteology. The TONSILS are small, slightly elongated bodies, which lie in the space between the anterior and posterior pillars of the soft

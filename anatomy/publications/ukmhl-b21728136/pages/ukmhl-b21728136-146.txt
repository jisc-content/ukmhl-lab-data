124 BONES OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY. Angles. The angles of the scapula are three in number and are called, respectively, the superior, the inferior, and the external angle. The superior angle is thin and prominent and affords attach- ment for the two first digitations of the serratus magnus muscle, and for a few fibres of the levator anguli scapulae and the supra- spinatus muscles. The inferior angle is thick and rounded and affords attachment to the serratus magnus and the teres major muscles. It occasion- ally affords attachment to some of the fibres of the latissimus dorsi muscle. The inferior angle of the scapula corresponds to the level of the seventh dorsal vertebra, and the seventh rib can thus be traced from behind forwards, remembering, however, that the head of the rib will be felt above the tip of the spine of the vertebra, which lies obliquely, and therefore not on the same level as the rib. At the external angle of the scapula is situated the glenoid cavity, called the head, separated by a constricted part called the neck of that bone. The head of the scapula forms the glenoid cavity, which is oval in shape, with its longest diameter directed ver- tically. It is shallow, and is deepened and enlarged by the glenoid ligament. It articulates with the head â€¢ of the humerus, and affords, by its upper part or apex, attachment to the tendon of the long head of the bi- ceps muscle. The neck of the scapula presents a bony projection, called the coracoid process, which affords attachment to three muscles, viz., the pectoralis minor, the coraco-brachi- alis and the short head of the biceps, and also for three ligaments, viz., the conoid, the trapezoid, and the coraco-acromial ligaments. Muscles attached. The scapula affords attachment to 16 muscles, which may be classified a$. follows :

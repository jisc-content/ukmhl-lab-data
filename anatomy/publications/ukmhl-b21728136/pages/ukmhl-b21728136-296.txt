274 MYOLOGY. Insertion. Into the posterior lip of the bicipital groove of the humerus. Nervous supply. The lower subscapular nerve. SUBSCAPULARIS. Origin. 1. From the inner two-thirds of the subscapular fossa. 2. From the aponeurosis, which separates it from teres major muscle. Insertion. Into the lesser tuberosity of the humerus, and, occa- sionally, by a few fibres into the neck of that bone. Nervous supply. The two upper subscapular nerves. Coraco-Brachialis. Origin. From the tip of the coracoid process of the scapula, in common with the short head of the biceps. Insertion. Into a rough ridge situated a little above the middle of the inner surface of the shaft of the hu- merus. Nervous supply. The musculo-cutaneous nerve. ACTION OF THE MUSCLES FORMING THE SCAP- ULO-HUMERAL GROUP. The direct action of these seven muscles may be thus classified: Muscles producing adduction of the arm Muscles producing abduction of the arm Muscles producing internal rotation of the arm Muscles producing external rotation of the arm, Muscles producing flexion of the arm The deltoid muscle raises the arm away from the side, so as to bring it at a right angle to the trunk. Its anterior fibres assist the pectoralis major in drawing the arm forwards; while its posterior iPectoralis maior (assisting). Latissimus dorsi (assisting). Teres major, j Deltoid.

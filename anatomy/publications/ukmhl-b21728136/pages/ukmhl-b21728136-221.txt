ME TA TARSAL ART1CULA TIONS. 99 2. A plantar set, which serve the same purpose, on the plan- tar aspect of the foot, but which are thinner and less regular in their situation. 3. An interosseous set, which comprises three strong ligaments, one of which is situated between the second metatar- sal bone and the internal cuneiform bone, and the other two between the external cuneiform bone and the second and third bones of the metatarsus. Metatarso-Metatarsal Articulations. The metatarsal bones, like the metacarpal, are connected with each other both at their tarsal and at their digital extremities. Tarsal extremities. The 1st and 2d metatarsal bones do not come into contact at their tarsal extremities, but between the other metatarsal bones arthrodial articulations exist. The ligaments of these articulations comprise three sets namely, a dorsal, a plantar and an interosseous set. Digital extremities. These extremities of the metatarsal bones are all joined together by a transverse band, which crosses the whole width of the metatarsus, and which is called the transverse metatarsal ligament. Metatarso-Phalangeal Articulations. These articulations differ, in no way, from those of the meta- carpo-phalangeal articulations w'hich are described in previous pages of this volume. The ligaments of the joints are also similar, and are two in number, viz. 1. The anterior or glenoid ligments. 2. The lateral ligaments (two for each joint). Phalangeal Articulations. These ginglymoid joints are similar to those of the fingers and the ligaments of each of them correspond to those of the meta- carpo-phalangeal articulations. Points of Surgical Interest in the Region of the Foot. The level of the ankle joint lies one half inch above the tip of the imier malleolus. The two malleoli are the surgical guides to the ankle joint, and present points of difference which are deserving of special notice.

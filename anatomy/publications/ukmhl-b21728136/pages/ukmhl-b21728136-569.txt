MUSCLES OF LARYNX. 541 Arytenoid. This is a single muscle, and is situated in the median line of the larynx between the two arytenoid cartilages. Origin. From the posterior surface and outer border of either arytenoid cartilage. Insertion. â€ž By oblique and transverse fibres, into the opposite cartilage. Nervous supply. From two sources, viz., the superior and the recur- rent laryngeal nerves. Action. By approximating the arytenoid cartilages, it closes the glottis, especially at its posterior part. Thyro-Epiglottideus. Origin. From the inner surface of the thyroid cartilage, ex- ternal to the point of origin of the thyro-arytenoid muscle. Insertion. Into the margin of the epiglottis and the aryteno- epiglottidean fold. Nervous supply. The recurrent laryngeal nerve. Action. To depress the epiglottis and to create compression of the sacculus laryngis. Aryteno-Epiglottideus Inferior. Origin. From the arytenoid cartilage, just above the false vocal cord. Insertion. Into the margin of the epiglottis. Nervous supply. The recurrent laryngeal nerve. Action. To depress the epiglottis, and to assist in compressing the sacculus laryngis. Aryteno-Epiglottideus Superior. Origin. From the apex of the arytenoid cartilage.

RIGHT SUBCLA VIAN ARTERY. 373 three nerves (pneumogastric, phrenic and cardiac) all cross the anterior wall of the artery and lie in close relation to it, being situated below the three deep muscles. The pleural covering of the lung lies in close relation to the inferior wall of the artery, since the apex of that organ rises high up within the neck, anjd it should be avoided in attempting to pass a ligature in this locality. The subclavian vein lies below the level of the artery, and is therefore not mentioned among the structures which bear a direct relation with it. The recurrent laryngeal nerve, on this side, winds around the subclavian artery and reaches the closest contact with it at its posterior surface. Behind the artery the sympathetic system of nerves, the longus colli muscle, and the transverse processes of the 7th cervical and of the 1st dorsal vertebrae, are in close relation but are still sepa- rated from it by a cellular interval. First Portion of the Left Subclavian Artery. The left subclavian artery arises from the end of the transverse portion of the arch of the aorta, and extends to the inner border of the scalenus anticus muscle. From the peculiarity as to its point of origin it differs from the first portion of the opposite subclavian artery in its length, direction and the structures to which it bears immediate relation. It is much longer than the right subclavian in its first portion, and instead of arching upwards, it ascends almost vertically from within the chest. Commencing as it does from the deepest portion of the arch of the aorta, this vessel is, at its origin, situated close to the ver- tebral column and behind the left lung. The left subclavian pre- sents in this portion of the artery the following relations.

102 SKELETON OF THE TRUNK. thus separates the cavity of the thorax from the'cavity of the abdomen. It is bounded behind by the twelfth dorsal vertebra, laterally by the lower two ribs, by the anterior portions of the false ribs and by the common costal cartilage, which unites the false ribs to the sternum, and, in front, by the ensiform appendix of the sternum. Outer Surface. The exterior aspect of the chest measures, in front, about 81 inches in depth, while, in its posterior portion, the depth of the chest is about 12 inches, and, if the sides be measured along the convexity of the ribs, the lateral depth of the thorax is about 12 inches. The posterior aspect of the thorax is depressed in the median line, and marked by the prominences of the spines of the vertebrae, by the two vertebral grooves on either side of the spines, by the transverse processes of the dorsal vertebrae and by the articulations between the ribs and the transverse processes. Away from the median line the posterior wall of the thorax becomes convex from the outward curve taken by the ribs after they leave their rela- tions with the dorsal vertebrae. Cavity. The cavity of the thorax is partly divided, in the median line, by the prominence of the bodies of the dorsal vertebrae, on each side of which the cavity of the chest is prolonged back- wards into two deep grooves or channels. The transverse diam- eter of the interior of the chest is greater than is its antero-posterior measurement. The cavity of the thorax contains the following structures: (1) The trachea, bronchial tubes and lungs. (2) The heart and pericardium. (3) The arch of the aorta, (4) The thoracic aorta and its branches. (5) The pulmonary artery, (6) The internal mammary artery. (7) The superior and inferior venae cavae. (8) The pulmonary veins. (9) The innominate veins. (10) The azygos veins. (11) The bronchial veins. (12) The oesophagus. (13) The thoracic duct.

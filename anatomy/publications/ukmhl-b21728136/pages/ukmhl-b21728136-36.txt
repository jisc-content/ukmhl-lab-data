THE SKELETON. 14 pared with the proportion present during adult life. In the bones of the trunk of the adult, on the contrary, no change from the foetal proportions between the organic and the in- organic bone ingredients occurs. The relative proportion existing between the earthy and mineral ingredients of bone exerts a marked influence on the development of the figure and on the rapidity of repair in case of fracture. Thus the bones become bent and twisted, when an excess of organic material is present, while a marked tendency to fracture is produced by a deficiency in those elements. In rickets, the former condition is usually present from some error in nutrition, while, in old age, the latter condition is liable to be developed.

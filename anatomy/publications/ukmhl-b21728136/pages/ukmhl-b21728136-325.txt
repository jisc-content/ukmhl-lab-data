MUSCLES OF LOWER EXTREMITY. 303 Iliacus. Origin. 1. From the iliac fossa and the inner lip of the crest of the ilium. 2. From the ilio-lumbar ligament. 3. From the base of the sacrum. 4. From the anterior superior and the anterior in- ferior spines of the ilium, and from the notch between them. 5. From the capsule of the hip joint (a few fibres.) Insertion. 1. Into the lesser trochanter of the femur, in com- mon with the tendon of the psoas magnus muscle. 2. Into a line running from the lesser trochanter to the linea aspera. Nervous Supply. An intra-pelvic branch of the anterior crural nerve. ACTION OF THE MUSCLES OF THE ILIAC REGION. The iliacus and psoas magnus muscles are powerful flexors of the thigh, if the fixed point during their action be the pelvis and the vertebral column. They also rotate the thigh outwards after flexion has been performed, on account of the obliquity of their insertion into the femur. If the fixed point during their action, however, be below their point of origin, these muscles tend to bend the pelvis and the lumbar vertebroe forward. In raising the trunk, when the body is in a recumbent position, these muscles become, therefore, powerful agents. These two muscles tend also to assist in maintaining an erect position of the body, by supporting the spine and the pelvis upon the femur. The psoas parvus is a simple tensor of the iliac fascia. NERVOUS SUPPLY OF THE MUSCLES OF THE ILIAC REGION. These muscles are all supplied by branches of the lumbar plexus, though the iliacus mus'cle is indirectly so supplied by an intrapelvic branch of the anterior crural nerve.

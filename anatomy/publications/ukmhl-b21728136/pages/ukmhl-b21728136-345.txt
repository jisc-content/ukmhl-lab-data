3 23 MUSCLES OF THE FOOT. ACTION OF THE MUSCLES OF THE FOOT. The action of the various muscles connected with the bones of the foot, will be found described in detail in the closing pages of this chapter, since it has been found that the action of the muscles of the leg and foot can be more clearly understood and more easily acquired when considered as a whole, than is practi- cable when they are subdivided into special regions. The readers of this volume are therefore referred to page 324 for a tabular arrangement of the muscles of the foot and leg, based on the re- spective action of each.

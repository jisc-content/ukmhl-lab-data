MYOLOGY; *5* Insertion. Into the posterior edge of the scapula, between the two roots of its spinous process. Nervous supply. The 5th cervical nerve. Rhomboideus Major. Origin. From the spinous processes of the four or five uppet dorsal vertebrae. Insertion. Into the base of the scapula, between its spine and its inferior angle. Nervous supply. The 5th cervical nerve. The levator anguli scapulce raises the angle of the scapula, after it has been depressed by the trapezius; and, if the shoulder be a fixed point, it may tend to incline the neck to the corres- ponding side. The rhomboid muscles, by carrying the angle of the scapula backwards and upwards, produce a slight rotation of the scapula upon the side of the chest. If the shoulder be made a fixed point, these muscles will draw the scapula directly backwards towards the spinal column, and, in this act, they are assisted by the middle and the inferior fibres of the trapezius. Below the scapula, upon the back, near the 7th, 8th and 9th ribs, is a triangular space bounded by the trapezius, latissimus dorsi and the rhomboideus major muscles, where the lung can be auscultated without muscular intervention, save the intercostals. This space can be enlarged by stooping and throwing the arms forwards upon the chest, as is usually done when auscultation of the chest is performed. THIRD LAYER. (2 muscles.) ORIGIN AND INSERTION. Serratus Posticus Superior. Origin. 1. From the ligamentum nuchae. 2. From the spinous processes of 7th cervical and 1st 2d and 3d dorsal vertebrae.

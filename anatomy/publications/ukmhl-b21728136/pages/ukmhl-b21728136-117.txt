THE RIBS. 95 (2.) A horizontal ridge exists between these facets, to which the interarticular ligament is attached. Neck of Rib. (1.) The neck is one inch in length and is flattened from before backwards. (2.) Its anterior surface is smooth. (3.) Its posterior surface is roughened for the costo- transverse ligments. (4.) Its upper border has a crest, for the superior costo- transverse ligments. (5.) Its lower border is rounded and smooth. Tuberosity of Rib. (1.) This prominence is most markedly developed upon the upper ribs. (2.) Its articular portion is revealed by a facet, into which the extremity of the transverse process of the in- ferior vertebra, with which the rib is connected, is adapted. (3.) Its non-articular portion is roughened for the attach- ment of the costo-transverse ligament. (2.) The Shaft. Exterior Surface. This is convex in its form and exhibits three points of interest, the posterior and anterior angles, and a posterior rounded portion. (1.) The posterior angle consists of a rough line running downwards, which gives attachment to the follow- ing muscles: The tendons of the sacro-lumbalis. The accessorius. The cervicalis ascendens. (2.) The anterior angle, which is similar to the posterior but less strongly marked. (3.) A rounded portion, which lies between the tubercle and the angle of the rib, for the attachment of the fibres of the longissimus dorsi muscle. Interior Surface. This surface is concave in form, and from the twisted condition of the ribs, looks upwards, at the back portion of the thorax, and downwards, in the an- terior portion of the chest. It presents a ridge, which is most marked in the

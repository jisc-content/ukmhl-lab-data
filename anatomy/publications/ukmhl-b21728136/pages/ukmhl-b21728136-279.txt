MUSCLES OF THE BACK. 257 5. By a broad and thick tendon which conceals the muscular fibres. Insertion. It divides, opposite the last rib, into the sacro-lum- balis and longissimus dorsi muscles. Nervous supply. External posterior branches of both the lumbar and the dorsal nerves. FIFTH LAYER. (8 muscles.) Of these muscles the spinales have their point of origin and in- sertion in the spinous processes of the vertebrae. The semi-spinales arise from the transverse processes of the vertebrae and are in- serted into the spinous processes, above the points of origin of the various muscles. ORIGIN AND INSERTION. Semi-spinalis Dorsi. Origin. From the transverse processes of the 5 th. 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th dorsal vertebrae. Insertion. Into the spinous processes of the four upper dorsal and the two last cervical vertebrae. Nervous supply. Internal posterior branches of the dorsal nerves. Semi-Spinalis Colli. Origin. From the transverse processes of the four upper dorsal vertebrae. Insertion. Into the spinous processes of the cervical vertebrae from the axis to the 5th. Nervous supply. Internal posterior branches of the cervical nerves. Multifidus Spiinme. This muscle fills up the groove on either side of the spinous processes of the vertebrae from the sacrum to the axis. Nervous supply. Internal posterior branches of both the cervical and sacral nerves.

SKELETON OF THE TRUNK. 82 (8.) The Laminae. These plates of bone are broad and flattened. They complete the arch and help to form the spinal foramen. They are roughened, on their upper and lower borders, for the attachment of the ligamentum subflava. (B.) REGIONAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE VERTEBRAL Cervical Vertebra. The cervical vertebrae are the smallest and the lightest of any of the three regions of the spine. They present for examination all the points designated as common to the vertebrae in general, with the exception of the atlas or 1st cervical vertebra and the axis or 2nd cervical vertebra, which will be described under the special vertebrae. The peculiarities which are the means of de- termining their situation, if examined apart from other vertebrae, are as follows: Body. Small and broad from side to side. The upper surface is concave from side to side, being surmounted laterally by the projecting laminae, and its greatest diameter is the trans- verse one. The under surface is convex and prolonged downwards in front, so as to overlap the ad- joining vertebra. The anterior surface is on a lower level than the posterior. These arise from the lower part of the body. The superior notches are the deepest. The laminae are fong and narrow. Spinal Foramen. The spinal opening is large and tri- angular. SPINOUS PROCESS. This process projects horizontally back- wards. It is short, bifid, and grooved on its lower surface. TRANSVERSE PROCESS. This process is short, bifid, and grooved upon its upper surface. It is perforated, at its base, by the vertebral foramen. Pedicles. Notches. Laminae.

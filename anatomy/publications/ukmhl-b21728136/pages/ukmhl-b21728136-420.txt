ANGIOLOGY. 39§ The superficial palmar arch lies on a level with the lower bor- der of the thumb, if abducted, and a finger’s breadth below the deep palmar arch. Branches. The ulnar artery gives off seven branches as follows: In the forearm, three branches; at the wrist, two branches ; in the hand, two branches. The following table gives the name and situation of each of these seven branches. A TABLE OF THE BRANCHES OF THE ULNAR ARTERY. f Anterior ulnar recurrent. I Posterior ulnar recurrent.

The posterior recurrent branch of the ulnar artery is larger in size than the preceding branch, and passes beneath the flexor sublimis digitorum and flexor carpi ulnaris muscles, on its way to the elbow joint. The interosseous branch is one inch in length and divides, at the upper border of the interosseous membrane, into two trunks called the anterior and posterior interosseous arteries. The anterior interosseous artery is in close relation with the corresponding branch of the median nerve, upon the anterior surface of the interosseous membrane. The posterior interosseous artery gives off an interosseous re- current branch, which ascends to the elbow joint; and the main artery joins the posterior carpal arch, formed by the posterior carpal branches of the radial and ulnar arteries. The anterior and posterior interosseous arteries are given off from the main trunk of the interosseous artery at a point situa- ted about two inches below the elbow joint; so that in amputation

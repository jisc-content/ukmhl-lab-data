THE OVARY. 577 state of development, and, when perfectly formed and matured, presents the following component parts. An external fibro-vascular covering. An internal coat, called the ovi-capsule. A layer of nucleated cells, called the membrana granulosa. An albuminous fluid. The ovum, surrounded by the proligerus disc. The matured Graafian vesicles are found near to the surface of the ovary, forming small projections upon it. The ovum, in all perfectly matured vesicles, measures about one hundred and twentieth of an inch in diameter, and presents the following component parts. The vitelline membrane or zona pellucida. The yolk or vitellus. The germinal vesicle. The germinal spot. The rupture of a Graafian vesicle is always associated with the development of a spot within the ovary, which exhibits an abnor- mal appearance and arrangement, and which is called the corpus luteum. In case of impregnation of the discharged ovum, the corpus luteum continues to develop, and, for that reason, two kinds of corpora lutea are recognized, viz., the true, when impreg- nation has occurred, and the false, when impregnation has not occurred. The artery of the ovary is derived from the internal iliac artery and enters at the hilum of the organ. The ovariayi vein escapes at the same situation and opens into the inferior vena cava, on the right side, and, on the left side, into the left renal vein. The nervous supply is derived from the ovarian plexus of the sympathetic. The organ of Rosenmuller or parovarium, consists of a group of scattered tubules, situated between the layers of the broad liga- ment and between the ovary and the Fallopian tube. These tubules are lined with epithelium, but have no external opening. They converge, however, to one large duct, which ramifies in the broad ligament, and which is called the duct of Gcertner.

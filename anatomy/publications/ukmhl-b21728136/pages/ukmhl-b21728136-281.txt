ACTION OF MUSCLES OF BACK. 2 59 ACTION OF THE MUSCLES OF THE BACK. The muscles of the back can be also classified on a basis of their action and function as follows : Those which act on the upper extremity (5) j Jnd Layer. Those which act upon the ribs and are therefore respiratory j rpHE D ^ muscles (2) ( ** â€™ Those which move the vertebral column as a whole and are ( ^ T extensors (9) { ^ Those which move the vertebra upon each other (8) -{The 5TH Layer. Total, 24 pairs of muscles. The muscles which bend the trunk backwards are r Erector spince. Sacro-lumbalis. Accessorius. ] Longissimus dorsi. Spinalis dorsi. I Multifidis spince. The muscles of the back tend to constantly keep the spine erect and they act also as an antagonistic force when% counterbal- ancing heavy weights suspended from the neck, or in cases of great abdominal enlargement as occurs in dropsy, pregnancy, or ab- dominal tumors. The multifidus spince muscle tends also, when acting singly, to rotate the trunk towards the side opposite to the muscle in con- traction, and it is chiefly by this muscle and the obliquus abdom- inis externus, that this motion of the trunk is performed. The separate fasciculi of the multifidus spince and the other muscles of the back allow of constant relaxation of some parts of the muscles while others are in contraction; and it is to this arrangement that man, in contrast to quadrupeds, is enabled to endure an erect spinal posture for so long a time without fatigue. The musculus accessorius possesses the power of elevating those ribs to which it is attached, provided the cervical vertebra becomes a fixed point, and might for that reason be considered an auxiliary muscle of inspiration. NERVOUS SUPPLY OF THE MUSCLES OF THE BACK. All the muscles of the back, save one, are supplied with motor power from the posterior branches of the spinal nerves. This ex- ception is the latissimus dorsi which is supplied by the long sub- scapular nerve.

501 THE S YM PA THE TIC NER VES. The superior cardiac nerves of either side, descend from the superior cervical ganglion to the cardiac plexuses. The middle cardiac nerves, the largest of the three, connect the middle cervical ganglion of either side with the deep cardiac plexus. The inferior cardiac nerves connect the inferior cervical gang- lia with the deep cardiac plexus. The great splanchnic nerve is formed by branches from several of the thoracic ganglia, and descends, through the posterior me- diastinum, till it perforates the crus of the diaphragm, after which it terminates in the semilunar ganglion. The lesser splanchnic nerve arises from the tenth and eleventh thoracic ganglia, pierces the diaphragm with the preceding nerve, and terminates in the coeliac plexus. The small splanchnic nerve arises from the twelfth thoracic ganglion, and, after piercing the diaphragm, terminates in the renal plexus, and in the lower part of the coeliac plexus.

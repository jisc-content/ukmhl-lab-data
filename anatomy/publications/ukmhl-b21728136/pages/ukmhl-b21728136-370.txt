Within the sheath of this vessel are enclosed the internal jugu- lar vein and the pneumogastric nerve. The common carotid artery within the neck is, at first, deeply situated but becomes superficial, near its point of termination. Its direction may be represented, upon the surface of the neck, by a line drawn from the sternal end of the clavicle to a point mid- way between the angle of the jaw and the mastoid process of the temporal bone.

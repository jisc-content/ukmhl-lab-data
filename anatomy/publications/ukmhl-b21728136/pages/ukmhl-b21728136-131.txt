THE OS INN 0 MIN A TUM. IO9 The margins of this notch give attachment to the round and the transverse ligaments of the hip joint. â€˜ The central depression of the acetabulum lodges a mass of fat as a bed for the round ligament of the hip joint. It is nearly circular in shape, is rough upon its surface, and is continuous with the cotyloid notch. It is formed chiefly by the ischium. OBTURATOR OR THYROID FORAMEN. This foramen is comprised between the pubes and the ischium. It is large and oval in the male sex, and smaller and triangular in the female. , It is closed by a membrane, called the obturator membrane, except at its upper part, where this membrane converts a groove, situated upon the under surface of the horizontal ramus of the pubes, into a complete foramen for the passage of the obturator vessels and nerves. THE ILIUM. The ilium is the superior expanded portion of the os innomi- natum. Its chief points of special anatomical interest can best be presented by a separate description of the following portions of the bone. (1) The outer surface, or dorsum. (2) The inner surface. (3) The upper border, or crest. (4) The anterior border. (5) The posterior border. , Outer Surface or Dorsum. This portion of the ilium is convex in front, where it looks downwards and outwards, while, behind, it is concave and looks downwards, outwards and backwards. (1) Three curved lines. (2) Three surfaces for muscular at- It presents for examination the following points tachment. of interest: (3) A section of the acetabulum. (4) A groove for the reflected tendon of the rectus femoris. The three curved lines, mentioned above, are termed respect- ively the superior, the middle, and the inferior curved lines of the dorsum ilii. They commence at different points upon this sur- face of the bone and all terminate in the vicinity of the great sciatic notch. The superior curved line arises about two inches in front of the posterior extremity of the crest, the middle curved line arises

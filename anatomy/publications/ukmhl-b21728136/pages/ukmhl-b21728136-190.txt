x68 ARTHROLOGY OR SYNDESMOLOGY. ular ends of bones, entering into the composition of diathrodial or movable joints. Fibro-cartilage may be either circumferential, where it helps to deepen cavities; 2, connective, where it helps to bind parts to- gether ; 3., inter-articular, where it tends to separate opposing bones, and 4, stratiform, where it lines grooves for tendons. The synovial membranes of the joints may be, 1st, articular, where they serve simply to lubricate the joint ; 2nd, vesicular, where they form shut sacs, called bursae; 3rd, vaginal, where they form a sheath for tendons. The following table illustrates by a tree-like figure, the three principal divisions of joints and the subdivisions of each. It will thus be seen that amp hiar thro sis (joints with limited motion) is divided into three distinct types, called respectively, synchondrosis, syndesmosis, syssarcosis; that synarthrosis (im- movable articulations) comprises four types, which are respect- ively named sutura, harmonia, schindylesis, and gomphosis ; and finally, that diarthrosis (joints with free motion) comprises three principal forms, called respectively, arthrodia, ginglymus, and enarthrosis. Diagram of the Varieties of Joints. Each of these types will be considered in their order. Synchondrosis, or symphysis, means union by cartilage. Syndesmosis means union by ligament. Syssarcosis means union by muscular tissue.

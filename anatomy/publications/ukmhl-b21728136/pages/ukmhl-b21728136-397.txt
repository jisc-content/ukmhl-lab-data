Other Relations. Right pleura lies beneath the artery. The artery from its direction admits of no relations towards the median lute of the body. Left pleura lies to the outer side of the ar- tery, as well as in front of it. The artery is related internally to the fol- lowing structures : 1. CEsophagus. 2. Trachea. 3. Thoracic duct. Length. The right subclavian artery varies in the length of its first portion from f to 1^ inches. The left subclavian artery varies in the length of its first portion from 1^ to 3 inches. Point of Origin. The right subclavian commences behind the right sterno-clavicular articula- tion. The left subclavian begins at the left ex- tremity of the transverse portion of the aortic arch. SECOND PORTION OF SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY. The second portion of each subclavian artery lies behind the scalenus anticus muscle, and is necessarily very short. It forms the highest portion of the arch, described by the vessel, .and is therefore the most distant from the line of the clavicle. This portion is less deeply situated than the first portion of the artery. Its relations to contiguous structures are as follows :

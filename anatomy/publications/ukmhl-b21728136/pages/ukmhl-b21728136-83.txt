In examining the exterior portion of the cranium, we are led to observe that certain well-marked lines exist, which indicate either actual or previously existing points of separation between the various bones composing it. To these lines the name of sutures is applied. The number of sutures existing between the bones of the cranium may be deduced by computing the number of cranial bones with which each cranial bone articulates, and thence com- puting the number of sutures that may possibly be formed. We thus find that thirty-four articulations exist within the cranium, as follows: Occipital Sphenoid Ethmoid Frontal Temporal Parietal articulates with 5 cranial bones. 7 “ 2 “ 4 “ 6 “ “ 10 “ “ Total 34 articulations. Now as it requires two bones to form a suture, by dividing the total number of articulations by 2 we get 17 as the number that must necessarily exist. These 17 sutures may be arranged in two ways as follows: Sutures at the vertex 5 “ “ sides 4 “ “ base 8 Total 17

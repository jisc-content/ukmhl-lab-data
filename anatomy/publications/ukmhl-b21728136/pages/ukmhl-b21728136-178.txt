156 BONES OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY. for the shaft appears rather later than in the tibia; that for the lower extremity appears in the second year; and that for the upper, not until the fourth year of age. In this bone, the portion exhibiting the first trace of ossifica- tion is the first to unite, being situated in the lower end of the bone, or in the external malleolus. This is an exception to a general law of ossification, but is still an observance of that law which is governed by the direction of the nutrient canal. General Summary. I.

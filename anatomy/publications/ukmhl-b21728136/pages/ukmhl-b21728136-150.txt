BONES OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY. 128 Upper Extremity. This portion of the humerus may be divided into the following portions: 1st, the head; 2nd, the ana- tomical neck ; 3rd, the surgical neck; 4th, the greater tuberosity; 5th, the lesser tuberosity; and 6th, the bicipital groove. The head represents nearly one-half of a sphere, and is much more extensive than the corresponding ar- ticular surface of the scapula (glenoid cavity). It looks upwards, inwards and backwards, and is bounded by a constriction in the humerus which is called the ana- tomical neck of that bone. The anatomical neck is nearly circular in form, ir- regular in its outline, and affords attachment to the capsular ligament of the shoulder joint. It separates the head from the tuberosities. The greater tuberosity is a large, rounded eminence situated upon the outer side of the bicipital groove. It presents, from before backwards, three small facets for the attachment of the supra-spinatus, infra-spina- tus and teres minor muscles. The lesser tuberosity is smaller but more prominent than the greater, and is situated in front of the head of the bone and upon the inner side of the bicipital groove. It affords attachment to the subscapularis muscle. The bicipital groove lies between the tuberosities and is comprised in the upper third of the bone. In it glides the tendon of the long head of the biceps, while to its bottom is attached the tendon of the la- tissimus dorsi muscle. It affords attachment, by its anterior or outer lip, to the pectoralis major muscle, and, by its posterior or inner lip, to the teres major muscle. It is deep and narrow above and broad and shallow below. The surgical neck is that slightly constricted portion which joins the upper extremity of the bone to its shaft. Lower Extremity. The lower extremity is slightly curved forwards and is flattened from before backwards. It presents for examination an articular surface and an inner and outer condyle.

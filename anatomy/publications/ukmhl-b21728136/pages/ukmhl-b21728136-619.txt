THE LA B YRINTH. 5 g j which is called the membranous labyrinth. The membranous labyrinth, is itself filled with a fluid, called the endolymph. The Osseous Labyrinth. The osseous portion of the internal ear may be subdivided into three distinct parts, to which the following names have been applied : The vestibule. The semi-circular canals. The cochlea. The VESTIBULE is the main cavity of the labyrinth, and is situated in its central portion, at the inner side of the cavity of the middle ear. It communicates, at its anterior part, with the scala vestibuli through a large opening, and, by five small open- ings, on its posterior wall, with the semi-circular canals. Upon its outer wall is a large opening called the fenestra ovalis, through which it would communicate with the cavity of the tympanum, were this opening not closed by the annular ligament of the stapes, and by the lining membrane of both cavities. The inner wall of the vestibule presents the following points of interest, to which special names have been applied : The fovea hemispherica. The macula cribrosa. The pyramidal eminence. The opening of the aquaeductus vestibuli. The fovea hemispherica is a small circular depression, which corresponds to the situation of the saccule. The macula cribrosa are numerous small openings, which give passage to branches of the saccular division of the ves- tibular nerve. The pyramidal eminence consists of a vertical ridge of bone, which separates the fovea from the opening of the aquaeductus vestibuli. The aquaeductus vestibuli is a canal, which extends to the posterior part of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, and opens into the middle fossa of the cranium. The roof of the vestibule presents the following points of in- terest. Part of the fovea hemispherica. Part of the pyramidal eminence. The fovea semi-elliptica. The first two, of these three points of interest, have already

THE PHALANGES. 163 The third, or ungual phalanges, including the second phalanx of the great toe, are flattened, from above downwards, and ex- panded laterally, at the base, to articulate with the second row, and, at the opposite extremity, to support the nail and the round- ed extremity of the toe. The first row of phalanges articulates with the metatarsal bones and the second phalanges. . The second row, in the great toe, articulates with the first pha- lanx, and, in the other toes, with the first and third phalanges. The third row articulates with the second row of phalanges, in all the toes but the great toe, where the third phalanx is wanting. MUSCLES ATTACHED TO PHALANGES. First Row. In the great toe, the abductor pollicis, the adductor pollicis, the flexor brevis pollicis, the transversus pedis and one of the tendons of the extensor brevis digito- rum, are inserted. In the second toe, the first and second dorsal in- terosseous and the first lumbricalis muscles are in- serted.

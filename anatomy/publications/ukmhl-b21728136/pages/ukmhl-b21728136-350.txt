MYOLOGY. 328 is in the middle,is represented, in the foot, when an effort to stand upon the toes is made. Weight of Muscles. body. F In this case, the toes become the fulcrum (F), the weight of the body the resistance to be overcome (R), and the power (P) re- mains at the heel. The third order of levers, where the power is applied in the middle, is represented in the foot when a weight is raised, when situated upon the toes. * Muscles. In this case, the heel of the ankle-joint become the fulcrum (F), the muscles of the anterior crural region the power (P), and the weight upon the toes the resistance to be overcome. To recapitulate then, we have three orders of levers named respectively the 1st, 2nd and 3rd. These orders may be thus represented: ft Lever of 1st order. £ — £ * 5 The centre being the ful- crum. Lever of 2nd order. £.— t --r — ^ The centre being the re- sistance. Lever of 3rd order. • £ f The centre being the ^ fower. A single rule can be given to remember these orders, since the centres F. R. P. rhyme with the number of the orders 1, 2, 3. In the foot these principles of leverage have great anatomical importance. The first order promotes the equilibrium of the body. The second order tends to overcome resistances. The third order facilitates motion.

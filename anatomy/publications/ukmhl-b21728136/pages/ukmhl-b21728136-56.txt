BONES OF THE HEAD. 34 Orbital Plates. These plates present for examination, an upper and an under surface. The under surface is concave in shape, and forms the upper wall of the cavity of the orbit. It contains at its external por- tion a depression of quite large size called the lachrymal fossa, since it lodges the lachrymal gland, and at its internal portion a smaller depression called the fovea trochlearis into which the pulley for the superior oblique muscle of the eye is inserted. The upper surface is convex in shape, and helps to form the floor of the anterior fossa of the cavity of the cranium. It pre- sents for examination only some well marked cerebral impressions Ethmoidal Notch. This notch is filled up by the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone. The under surface of the margins of this notch present the following points of anatomical interest and importance. (i.) Several half cells, which complete and close the corres ponding half cells of the ethmoid bone. (2.) Two grooves, which also help to complete the anterior and posterior ethmoidal canals for the transmission of the nasal nerve and the anterior and posterior ethmoidal vessels. (3.) The nasal spine which here articulates with the perpen- dicular plate of the ethmoid, and with the nasal bones, and which helps to form a part of the nose. (4.) The openings of the frontal sinuses, which are situated upon either side of the nasal spine. Articulations of the Frontal Bone. The frontal bone articulates with 12 bones which may be thus classified: The Frontal Bone articulates with 12 bones, viz.: Two single or mesial (2) (Sphenoid. bones. \ Ethmoid.

Total, 12 Of these 12 bones with which the frontal bone articulates, it will thus be perceived that only two are single or mesial bones,

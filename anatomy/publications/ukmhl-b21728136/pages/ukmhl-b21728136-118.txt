96 SKELETON OF THE TRUNK. posterior two-thirds of the shaft of the rib, and which gives attachment to the internal intercostal muscles. This ridge forms the internal boundary of a groove along the lower border of the rib for the protection of the intercostal vessels and nerves. Upper Border. This portion of the shaft of the rib is smooth and gives attachment to both the external and internal intercostal muscles. Lower Border. This border is thin and sharp and helps to form the groove for the intercostal vessels. It gives attach- ment to the external intercostal muscles. (3.) Anterior Extremity. This portion of the rib is compressed and flattened from before backwards. It is studded with minute foramina for the passage of vessels, and presents for inspection a deep oval pit or depression, into which the corresponding costal cartilage is in- serted. PECULIAR RIBS. The 1st, 2nd, 10th, nth and 12th ribs present certain pecu- liarities which enables the accomplished anatomist to readily dis- tinguish them, even if detached from the skeleton. These points of peculiarity will be found enumerated below in detail. First Rib. The upper surface presents '(i.) A rough impressionior the scalenus medius muscle. (2.) A tubercle for the scalenus anticus muscle. < (3.) Two grooves, the anterior one being for the subcla- vian vein, and the posterior one for the subclavian artery. The under surface has neither a ridge nor a groove. The inner border presents a part of the tubercle for the scalenus anticus muscle. The head has only a single facet for articulation with the 1st dorsal vertebra. The tuberosity and the angle are blended together. The anterior extremity is unusually large and thick. Second Rib. The outer or upper surface presents f (1.) Rough spots near its middle for the 1st and 2nd serrations of the serratus magnus muscle. | (2.) A rough posterior impression for the scalenus f posticus muscle.

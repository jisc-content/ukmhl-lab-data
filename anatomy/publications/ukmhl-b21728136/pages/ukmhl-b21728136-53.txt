ETHMOID BONE. 31 (4) The middle meatus. This canal within the nasal fossa, opens anteriorly and communicates with the anterior ethmoidal cells, and, by means of a wide funnel-shaped canal called the in- fundibulum, it also communicates subsequently with the frontal sinuses. The outer surface of the lateral masses of the ethmoid bone presents a smooth thin plate of bone which helps to form the inner wall of the orbit, and which is called the os planum. The os planum articulates with the following bones within the cavity of the orbit. Articulation of the Os Planum of the Ethmoid -{ bone.

Articulations of the Ethmoid. The ethmoid bone articulates with 13 bones which may be thus enumerated. ! Sphenoid. Frontal. Vomer. The Ethmoid Bone artic- ulates with 13 bones, as follows: 5 pairs of bones (10) < 'Nasal. Superior Maxillary. Lachrymal. Palate. Inferior turbinated. Total, 13 It will thus be perceived that the ethmoid bone articulates with all the bones of the upper jaw, with the exception of the two malar, and this number is complemented by the addition of the sphenoid and the frontal bones of the cranium. Muscles. The ethmoid bone affords attachment to no muscle. Development. The ethmoid bone develops by three centres of ossification, one of which is situated in each of the lateral masses and one within the perpendicular plate of the bone. This bone, at the time of birth, presents no attempt at ossifi- cation in either the horizontal or the perpendicular plates, but ossific granules are present in the lateral masses of the bone. The lateral masses become joined to the cribriform plate of

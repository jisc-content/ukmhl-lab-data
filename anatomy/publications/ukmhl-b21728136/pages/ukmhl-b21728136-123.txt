THE THORAX IN GENERAL. IOI Development. The sternum is developed by six centres of ossification, the situation of which is shown in the following table; The Sternum is developed by six cen- tres of ossification, as follows : !For the manubrium one centre. For the gladiolus four centres. For the ensiform appendix one centre. Two small additional centres, called the episternal centres, are described by some authors as existing upon either side of the in- terclavicular notch. THE THORAX IN GENERAL. The thorax is conical in its shape, with convex walls and with an axis which is directed obliquely downwards and forwards. It is broadest below and in its transverse measurement. It is bounded by the dorsal vertebrae, the ribs, the costal cartilages and the sternum. It presents for examination, An upper opening or apex, A lower opening or base, An outer surface, An internal cavity. Each of these portions deserve a special consideration, since a special description of the individual bones, still leaves unmen- tioned many points of practical interest and value. Upper Opening. â€¢ The thoracic entrance is narrow, heart-shaped, and is inclined obliquely downwards and forwards. It is bounded, behind, by the first dorsal vertebra, laterally, by the first rib and its costal cartilage, and, in front, by the first bone of the sternum. It gives passage to the following structures: (1) The trachea. (2) The oesophagus. (3) The large vessels of the neck. (4) The pneumogastric nerves. (5) The phrenic nerves. (6) The sympathetic nerves. (7) The apex of the lung during inspiration. (8) The thoracic duct. Lower Opening. This opening of the thorax is widest, in its transverse diameter, opposite the level of the ensiform appendix. Its anterior diame- ter is encroached upon, by the prominence of the body of the last dorsal vertebra. It is filled in below by the diaphragm, which

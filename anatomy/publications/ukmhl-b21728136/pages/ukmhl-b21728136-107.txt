(C.) CHA ACTERISTICS PECULIAR TO CERTAIN VER- TEBRAE. In the different parts of the vertebral column, there are verte- brae which, in addition to general regional characters, possess indi- vidual characteristics, by which they may be distinguished from all the rest. These vertebrae may be thus enumerated : In the cervical region, (3), atlas, axis and vertebra prominens. In the dorsal region, (5), 1st, 9th, 10th, nth, 12th. dorsal ver- tebrae. In the lumbar region, (1), 5th. lumbar vertebrae.

MUSCLES OF THE ABDOMEN. 23 7 Nervous supply. The ilio-hypogastric nerve. Obliquus Abdominis Externus. (External or descending oblique). Origin. By eight fleshy digitations, from the external sur- face and lower borders of the lower eight ribs. Insertion. 1. By fleshy fibres, into the anterior half of the outer lip of the crest of the ilium. 2. Into the whole length of the linea alba, by means of an aponeurosis. 3. By Poupart’s and Gimbernat’s ligaments, into the spine of the pubes and into about one inch of the pectineal line. Nervous supply. The lower intercostal nerves. Action. To depress the ribs, to compress the viscera, to raise the pelvis if the thorax be fixed, or to flex the spine, if the pelvis be made a fixed point. The so-called “ triangular ligament ” is a reflection of fibres from Gimbernat’s ligament to the linea alba. Obliquus Abdominis Internus. Origin. 1. From the external half of Poupart’s ligament. 2. From the anterior two-thirds of the middle lip of the crest of the ilium. 3. From the posterior layer of the fascia lumborum. Insertion. 1. By fleshy fibres, into the lower borders of the four inferior costal cartilages. 2. Into the linea semi-lunaris and the linea alba. 3. Into the body of the pubes and the pectineal line, in common with the fibres of the transversalis muscle, thus forming the so-called “ conjoined tendon" Nervous supply. Ilio-hypogastric and ilio-inguinal nerves Transversalis Abdominis. Origin. 1. From the external third of Poupart’s ligament. 2. From the anterior three-fourths of the internal lip of the crest of the ilium.

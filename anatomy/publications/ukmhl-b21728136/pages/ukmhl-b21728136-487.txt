THE CEREBRO-SPINAL NERVES. In the chapter of this work upon myology, a detailed descrip- tion has already been given to the reader of most of the import- ant motor nerves of the body; and many tables have been there incorporated which, by their classified arrangement, are intended to assist the anatomical student in mastering their points of dis- tribution. It is therefore been deemed unnecessary to again give, in detail, a separate distribution of those nerves, which already have been so exhaustively considered; but, in place of it, is appended a tabulated arrangement of the nerves of the body, which illus- trates, with tolerable completeness and accuracy, all points which are of special value. Occasional explanatory text will be found introduced, between these various tables, for the purpose of attracting attention to some points of special interest included in them, or for the purpose of recording some facts, which cannot well be embraced in a tabular form of statement, without creating confusion. This text will only be found valuable, however, if used in conjunction with the tables which precede it. In these tables the nerves which arise from the cerebro-spinal axis will be found considered in the following order. A. The cranial nerves. B. The nerves of the cervical region. C. The nerves of the upper extremity. D. The nerves of the dorsal region. E. The nerves of the lumbar region. F. The nerves of the sacral region. G. The nerves of the leg and foot.

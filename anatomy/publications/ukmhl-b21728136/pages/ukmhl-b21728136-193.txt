ARTICULATIONS OF OCCIPITAL BONE. jyi communicates with the synovial membrane between the odontoid process and the transverse ligament of the atlas. The articulation of the condyles of the occipital bone with the cups of the atlas, corresponds nearly to a line drawn through the anterior margins of the mastoid processes of the temporal bone. Occipito-axoid Articulation. The head and the axis do not touch each other, but neverthe- less, the four following connecting ligaments exist: Occipito-axoid ligament. Three occipito-odontoid ligaments, comprising Two lateral or check ligaments. A median or suspensory ligament. The occipito-axoid ligament is a continuation upwards of the posterior common ligament of the bodies of the ver- tebrae. The check ligaments extend, upon either side, from the inner side of the condyles of the occipital bone to the sides of the odontoid process of the axis, near to its apex. The suspensory ligament extends from the anterior margin of the foramen magnum to the apex of the odontoid process of the axis. Atlo-axoid Articulation. This is a complex joint, consisting, first, of a double arthrodia between the articular processes of the atlas and the axis, and also of a double diarthrosis rotatorius between the odontoid process and the atlas. Its ligaments are six in number, which are as follows: Two anterior atlo-axoid ligaments. A posterior atlo-axoid ligament. A transverse ligament. Two capsular ligaments. The anterior ligaments consist of a superficial ligament, which extends from the anterior tubercle of the atlas to the base of the odontoid process and the body of the axis; and a deep ligament which extends from the lower border of the anterior arch of the atlas to the base of the odontoid process and the body of the axis. The posterior ligament extends from the lower border of the posterior arch of the atlas to the upper border of the laminae of the axis.

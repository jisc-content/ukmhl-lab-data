MYOLOGY. 250 ORIGIN AND INSERTION. SUPERFICIAL LAYER. (2 muscles.) Trapezius. Origin. 1. From the ligamentum nuchae and the correspond- ing portion of the supra-spinous ligament. 2. From the spinous processes of the 7th cervical and the 12th dorsal vertebrae. 3. From the inner third of the superior curved line of the occipital bone. Insertion. 1. Into the upper lip of the spine of scapula. 2. Into the inner margin of the acromion process. 3. Into the external third of the posterior border of the clavicle. Nervous supply. Spinal accessory nerve, or nth cranial, and the deep branches of the cervical plexus. The lower border of the trapezius muscle may be defined, upon the'back of a living subject, by a line drawn from the spine of the scapula to the spine of the last dorsal vertebra. Latissimus Dorsi. Origin. 1. From the spinous processes of the lower six dor- sal vertebrae and the supra-spinous ligament. 2. From the spinous processes of the lumbar verte- brae and the sacrum. 3. From the posterior third of the outer lip of the crest of the ilium. 4. From the last four ribs, by fleshy digitations. Insertion. Into the bottom of the bicipital groove of the humerus. Nervous supply. The long sub-scapular nerve, from the brachial plexus. The upper border of the latissimus dorsi muscle may be de- fined, upon the back of a living subject, by a line drawn from the spine of the sixth dorsal vertebra in a horizontal direction over the inferior angle of the scapula.

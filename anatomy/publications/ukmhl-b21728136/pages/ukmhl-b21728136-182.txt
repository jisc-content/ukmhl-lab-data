BONES OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY. i6o bone. In this bone, the dorsal surface presents a groove for the tendon of the tibialis anticus muscle, and, on its plantar surface, a tubercle for the insertion for the tibialis posticus muscle. The internal and middle cuneiform bones each articulate with four bones, but the external cuneiform articulates with six, since three metatarsal bones are in contact with it. The internal cuneiform affords attachment to two muscles, viz., the tibialis anticus and the tibialis posticus. The middle cuneiform bone affords attachment to one muscle, viz., the flexor brevis pollicis. The external cuneiform bone, at its inferior surface, also affords attachment to one muscle, viz., the flexor brevis pollicis muscle. METATARSAL BONES. The metatarsal bones are five in number, are long bones, and are divisible, therefore, into a shaft and two extremities. The shaft of each is prismoidal in form and is compressed from side to side. The tarsal extremity or base of each bone is square in shape and articulates with the tarsal bones and with each other. The anterior extremity forms a rounded head, circumscribed by a constricted portion called the neck, and articulates with the first row of phalanges. Peculiarities of the metatarsal bones. The first metatarsal bone is shorter and larger than the rest. It forms the inner border of the foot. The second metatarsal bone is the longest and the largest of the remaining four. At its base it has three articular facets, since it joins with three cuneiform bones. The third metatarsal bone has two facets on the outer side of its base and is of small size. The fourth metatarsal bone is of small size and has a single articular facet upon each side of its base. The fifth metatarsal bone is recognized by its broad base and by the absence of an articular facet on its outer side.

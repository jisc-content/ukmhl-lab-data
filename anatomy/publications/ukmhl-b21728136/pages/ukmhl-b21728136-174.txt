The bones of the leg are three in number, viz.: 1. The patella, or knee-pan. 2. The tibia, or shin-bone. 3. The fibula. If the patella be recognized as a distinct bone, for it is often classed as one of the sesamoid bone, it affords attachment to four muscles, viz. : Rectus femoris. Vastus externus. Crureus. Vastus internus. The patella is a triangular-shaped bone and presents two sur- faces, called the anterior and the posterior surfaces, a base, which looks upwards, and an apex, which looks downwards. The posterior surface has a ridge dividing it into two portions. The anterior surface is convex and is perforated with numer- ous apertures, through which pass the nutrient vessels of the bone. The base of the bone is that border which is directed upwards and which affords attachment for the muscles mentioned above. The apex of the bone is that border which is directed down- wards and which affords attachment to the ligamentum patellae. The patella articulates with one bone, viz., the femur. It also enters into the formation of the knee-joint. TIBIA. The tibia, or shin-bone, is the large bone of the leg. It is prismoidal in form and is divisible into a shaft, an upper and a lower extremity. Upper Extremity. The upper extremity or head of the tibia is of large size and is expanded upon either side into two bony projections called the tuberosities of the tibia. The upper surface of the head and tuberosities artic- ulates with the condyles of the femur. The articular surface upon the inner tuberosity is oval in shape, and

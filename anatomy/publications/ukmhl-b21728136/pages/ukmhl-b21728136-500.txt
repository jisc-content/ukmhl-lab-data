The posterior division of each of the cervical nerves as shown in the preceding tables, are principally distributed to muscles and have no special names, with the exception of one branch which is derived from the second cervical nerve, and which is called the great occipital nerve. The anterior divisions of the first four cervical nerves, however, enter into the formation of the cervical plexus, while those of the lower four cervical nerves enter into the formation of the brachial plexus, which is not shown in the preceding tables, since the dis- tribution of the latter plexus causes it to be more properly classed among the nerves of the upper extremity. It will be seen by reference to the preceding table that the cervical plexus is first subdivided into branches which lie near the surface and those more deeply placed; that the superficial set

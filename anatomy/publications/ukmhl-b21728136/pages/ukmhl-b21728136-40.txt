i8 BONES OF THE HEAD. the position of the parts in the erect posture of the body, and the neglect of this caution has tended, in no small degree, to em- barrass the student, and to render description otherwise full and complete, almost unintelligible. THE OCCIPITAL BONE. This bone is situated in the posterior and inferior part of the cranium. In form,it is classed among the flat bones. Its direc- tion is both horizontal and vertical, since it enters into the forma- tion both of the base of the skull and the posterior portion of the cranium. The occipital bone presents for special consideration the fol- lowing component parts: An outer surface. An inner surface. Four borders j *Â£*$> f Lateral (2.) Four angles -j Superior (1.) ( Inferior (1.) Outer Surface. This portion of the occipital bone is convex in shape, and possesses several points of anatomical interest which may be thus described: (1.) A projection called the occipital protuberance for the in- sertion of the ligamentum nuchae. (2.) A bony ridge running from the occipital protuberance to the foramen magnum, and called the occipital crest. (3.) Two curved lines called the superior and inferior curved lines of the occipital bone. The superior affords at- tachment to the occipito-frontalis, sterno-mastoid and trapezius muscles. The inferior gives attachment to the rectus capitis posticus major and minor muscles. (4.) A space between the two curved lines, from which arise the complexus, splenius capitis and the superior oblique muscles. (5.) The foramen magnum, through which pass the spinal cord and its membranes, the spinal accessory nerves and the vertebral arteries. (6.) The condyles of the occipital bone, which are oblong in shape, converging in front, looking downwards, for- wards and outwards, and which are roughened on their inner aspect for the insertion of the check ligaments. They articulate with the cups of the atlas.

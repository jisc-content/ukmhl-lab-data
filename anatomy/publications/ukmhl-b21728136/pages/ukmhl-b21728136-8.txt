IV PREFACE. the beginner; while they have aimed also to render it a volume of easy reference to the Surgeon and Practitioner. Much of the matter contained has been tabulated and ar- ranged in such a systematic form as to render the perusal of page after page of printed matter unnecessary, and, as far as possible, all points, having a practical bearing, have been so mentioned. It will be observed, possibly to its detriment in the opinion of some, that this volume deals principally with anatomical facts, rather than with questionable microscopical discoveries, since, however valuable the latter may be as a step towards positive knowledge, they are constantly changing with the advance of science, and can be best acquired from the exhaustive treatises which are from time to time appearing upon these subjects. To the casual reader, there may seem, throughout this work, a redundancy of expression, which might have been avoided; but, as this book has been partly devised to aid reference among the general practitioners of medicine, who have, too often, little time for further reading than is demanded to gain the point sought for, it has been deemed expedient to render each descriptive para- graph as little dependent upon those preceding it, as possible. The few diagrammatic illustrations, which are contained within this volume, are presented rather as a means of impressing some particular points than as accurate representations of the parts under consideration. Many of the valuable tables contained in the chapters upon osteology and myology, have been for years a part of the course of lectures of Professor Darling before the classes of the Medical Department of the New York University, and have appeared in print in Europe, while many new ones have been added to sim- plify other branches of the subject. As this work has not been intended to supplant, but rather to accompany more exhaustive treatises, the absence of illustrations will not materially detract from its usefulness, since even begin- ners in medicine would hardly be well equipped for their work without some one of the standard text-books, while to the prac- titioner of medicine or surgery, in whose libraries are probably contained volumes replete with illustrations, this work is given to simplify anatomical review and to aid easy reference. It seems especially important to the Authors that the explan- atory matter connected with most of the tables and diagrams of this work should be perused with care, before .they are used as aids to study or reference, since both will be greatly simplified by so doing.

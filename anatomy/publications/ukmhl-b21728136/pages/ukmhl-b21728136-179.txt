15 7 THE BONES OF THE FOOT. HI. The digits are also five in number, and each consists of three bones, named phalanges, with the exception of the great toe or “ hallux,” which has only two. The phalanges are four- teen in number and are counted from behind forwards, or from the heel towards the toes. The digits are named numerically from within outwards. Plan of the Bones of the Foot. Internal por- External por- tion, 16 bones. tion, 10 bones. This diagram of the bones of the foot is intended to illustrate the relative position of the bones to each other as well as the situation of the various amputations which are performed in this region. It also illustrates some points of anatomical value, to which the attention of the student is not always directed, viz. : I. The bones of the foot may be divided into two lateral halves, the external half comprising ten bones, and the internal half com- prising sixteen bones. II. The bones of the foot are seen, in the second place, to be capable of being divided transversely in the following regions: I, between each row of the phalanges, 2, at the junction of the metatarsal bones with the tarsus, 3, in the middle of the tarsus, between the scaphoid and the cuboid bones, in front, and the as- tragalus and the os calcis, behind. The operations of Hey and Chopart as indicated in the diagram consist therefore of disarticu- lating certain bones of the foot from each other.

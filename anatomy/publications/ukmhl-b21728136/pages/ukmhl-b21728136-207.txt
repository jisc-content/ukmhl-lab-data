185 METACARPAL JOINTS\ The four inner metacarpal bones are connected to each other both at their carpal and at their digital extremities. Carpal extremities, The articulations of the carpal extremities of the metacarpal bones are three in number and are arthrod- ial in character. The ligaments of these joints consist first, of an interosseous set, which pass between the bones ; second, a dorsal set, which are mainly directed across the back of the hand, and third, a palmar set, which is directed also transversely across the palm of the hand. Digital extremities. The digital extremities of the metacarpal bones are all joined together by the so called transverse ligament of the metacarpus. The transverse ligament of the metacarpus prevents the wide separation of the fingers. It can be felt in the interdigital folds of the hand, and the skin which covers them is much thinner on the dorsal surface of the hand than on the palmar surface. Ab- scesses of the palm, for that reason, often open on the back of the hand. Metacarpo-phalangeal Articulations. The articulations between the metacarpal bones and the cor- responding phalanges are ginglymus in variety. The ligaments which enter into the formation of these joints are as follows: I. Anterior or glenoid ligaments. These ligaments are lined with a synovial membrane. They are grooved for the passage of the flexor tendons of the fingers, and, upon either side, they become continuous with the sheaths of these tendons. II. Lateral liga?nents. These ligaments connect the tubercles on the sides of the head of each metacarpal bone with the glenoid ligament, and also with the sides of the first phalanges. Phalangeal Articulations. The articulations between the rows of phalanges are gingly- mus in variety. The ligaments of each of these joints, like those of the preced- ing articulations, consist of an anterior and two lateral ligaments for each joint.

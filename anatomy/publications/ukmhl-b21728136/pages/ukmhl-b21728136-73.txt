Total, 4 THE LACHRYMAL BONES. These bones of the face help to form the inner wall of the cavity of the orbit. Each bone presents for examination two surfaces and four borders, since it is nearly quadrilateral in shape. Touter surface of the bone presents for special examination the following points. (1.) A marked groove, which forms a part of the nasal duct. (2.) A ridge 1 which affords attachment to the tensor tarsi muscle. (3.) A smooth surface, which forms the inner wall of the orbit. The inner surface forms a portion of the anterior part of the middle meatus of the nose, and articulates, at its posterior ^ex- tremity, with the ethmoid bone. It presents a furrow which corresponds to the ridge upon the outer surface of the bone. The anterior border articulates with the nasal process of the superior maxillary bone. The superior border articulates with the internal angular pro- cess of the frontal bone. The posterior border of the bone articulates with the os planum of the ethmoid. The inferior border articulates with the orbital plate of the superior maxillary bone, and, in front, it is prolonged into a pointed process, called the hamulus lachrymalis, which articulates with the lachrymal process of the inferior turbinated bone, and which forms part of the nasal duct. Muscles. The lachrymal bone affords attachment to only one muscle, viz., the tensor tarsi.

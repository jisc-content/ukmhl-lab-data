THE AORTA. 341 The descending portion of the arch of the aorta begins at the upper edge of the 3d dorsal vertebra and curves downwards in a nearly straight course, until it reaches the lower border of the left side of the 4th dorsal vertebra where the name thoracic aorta is usually applied to it.

Left side of body of third dorsal vertebra. THE ARCH OF THE AORTA AS A WHOLE. The three segments of the arch of the aorta vary in their posi- tion within the chest during the act of respiration, since the dia- phragm, being attached to the pericardium, and, through that membrane, to the coats of the large arterial vessels, tends to de- press the aorta during inspiration. This respiratory movement of the arch of the aorta is however most marked in the ascending portion, much less apparent in the transverse portion, and least of all in the descending portion. The aorta, as a tube, shows constant variations in its calibre. At the aortic orifice it is markedly constricted; at the sinuses of Valsalva, it enlarges to a circumference of four inches ; it then becomes again constricted, immediately above the sinuses, to a circumference of about three and a quarter to three and a half inches ; at the junction of the ascending and transverse portions, the enlargement known as the sinus magnum gives to the aorta a circumference exceeding even that of the region over the sinu- ses of the Valsalva ; the transverse portion has a nearly uniform calibre of about three and a half inches ; and finally a rapid de- crease in size is again present in the descending portion of the arch. It has already been stated that the axis of the left ventricle in repose, if prolonged into the aorta, impinged upon the right wall of that vessel, at the point of junction of the ascending and

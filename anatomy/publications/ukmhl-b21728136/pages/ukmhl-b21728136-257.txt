MUSCLES OF THE NECK. 235 The larynx becomes suddenly raised by the mylo-hyoid, genio- hyoid, stylo-hyoid, thyro-hyoid, genio-hyo-glossus, and the ante- rior belly of the digastric muscles; and the pharynx becomes si- multaneously widened by the approximation of its two extremities. The soft palate is raised, by the action of the levator palati muscle and by the pressure of the bolus; and the azygos uvulae is grasped by the contraction of the superior constrictor muscle of the pharynx, which thus prevents the regurgitation of food into the nares. The isthmus of the fauces is subsequently closed behind the bolus, as it passes that point; and, by the close approximation of the palato-pharyngeus muscles, the nares and buccal cavity are further protected from regurgitation. The larynx is protected from the entrance of the food, by an adaptation of the tongue and epiglottis to its superior opening; and also by the approximation of the vocal cords and compression of the superior opening, through the action of the crico-arytenoid lateralis, the aryteno-epiglottideus superior, and the arytenoid muscles. The successive contraction of the three constrictor muscles of the pharynx drives the bolus, therefore, into the oesophagus, since all other means of exit from its cavity are closed. The third period is characterized by contractions of the longi- tudinal muscular fibres of the oesophagus, which constantly slips its mucous membrane above the bolus, and by subsequent con- traction of its circular fibres, in a peristaltic action similar to that perceived in the lower portions of the alimentary canal.

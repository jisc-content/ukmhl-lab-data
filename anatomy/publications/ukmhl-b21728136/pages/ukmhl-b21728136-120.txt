98 SKELETON OF THE TRUNK. They give attachment to the following two muscles: the subclavius and the pectoralis major; and also to the rhomboid or costo-clavicular ligament. (2.) Posterior surfaces. These are concave in shape and look downwards and backwards. They give attachment to three muscles: the triangu- laris sterni, the transversalis abdominis and the dia- phragm.) (3.) Upper borders. These are concave and serve for the purpose of attach- ment of the intercostal muscles. The 7th, 8th and 9th cartilages reveal a depression or facet, for articulation with the adjoining cartilage. (4.) Lower borders. These are convex and serve for the purpose of attach- ment of the intercostal muscles, the internal oblique muscle of the abdomen, and the rectus abdominis. The 6th, 7th and 8th cartilages present, upon this border, articular facets for the other cartilages named above. (5.) Costal extremities. The costal cartilages are largest where they join the rib. This extremity is rough and rounded and is im- planted into and becomes continuous with the anterior extremity, of its corresponding rib. (6.) Anterior or Sternal extremities. This extremity is smaller than that attached to the ribs. It is smooth and triangular in shape and fits into an articular notch in the sternum, in the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th cartilages. In the 8th, 9th and 10th cartilages this extremity joins with other cartil- ages. In the nth and 12 cartilages this extremity is free, while in the 1st costal cartilage it appears as a direct continuation of the sternum itself. THE STERNUM. The sternum presents for examination the following parts: {The Manubrium. The Gladiolus. is The Ensiform or Xiphoid Appendix. 2 Surfaces. Originally the sternum consists of six points of ossification, of

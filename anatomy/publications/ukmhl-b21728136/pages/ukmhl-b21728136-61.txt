TEMPORAL BONE. 39 (6.) A depression which lies above the location of the tym- panum or the cavity of the middle ear. Posterior Surface. * This surface of the petrous portion of the temporal bone forms the anterior boundary of the posterior fossa at the base of the skull. It presents two openings, as follows: (i.) The meatus auditorius internus. The internal canal leading to the cavity of the tympanum transmits the facial and auditory nerves and the audi tory artery. It also transmits a prolongation of the dura mater of the brain. (2) The opening of the aquceductus vestibuli. This opening transmits a small artery and vein to the vesti- bule, and also a process of dura mater. â–  Inferior or Basilar Surface. The petrous portion of the temporal bone forms a portion of the base of the skull. This surface presents the .following points for special consideration. (1.) A diagonal line running from before backwards and out- wards. (2) The opening of the carotid canal, through which passes the internal carotid artery and the carotid plexus of nerves. (3) The aquceductits cochlea, which transmits a vein to the cochlea. (4.) The jugular fossa, which lodges the sinus of the internal jugular vein, and which assists in forming the jugular foramen or the foramen lacerum posterius. (5.) An opening for Jacobson's nerve, which is situated in front of the jugular fossa upon a bony ridge between it and the carotid canal. (6.) An opening for Arnold's nerve, which is situated upon the outer wall of the jugular fossa. (7.) The jugular surface, which articulates with the jugular process of the occipital bone. (8.) The vaginal process which embraces the root of the styloid process of the temporal bone. (9.) The styloid process, which affords attachment to the fol- lowing structures from above downwards. The stylo-pharyngeus muscle. The stylo-hyoid muscle.

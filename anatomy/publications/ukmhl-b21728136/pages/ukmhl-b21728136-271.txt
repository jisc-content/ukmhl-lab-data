MUSCLES OF THE BACK. 249 In the acts of hiccough, crying, sobbing, laughing and snuffing of odoriferous effluvia, the diaphragm is the most important fac- tor, as its spasmodic and involuntary contractions produce those sudden and unexpected inspirations experienced in all of these five conditions. The external intercostal muscles raise the ribs and are there- fore muscles of inspiration. They are, however, assisted in this act by the levatores costarum and the sternal portion of the in- ternal intercostals. The external intercostals are wanting in the region of the costal cartilages, being attached only to the rib. The intercostal muscles can, however, elevate the ribs only after the first rib has been made a fixed point by the scaleni muscles, since their action is essentially from above downwards.

134 BONES OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY,. The two borders present for examination a continua- tion only of the grooves, previously mentioned, for the internal and posterior ligaments of the elbow-joint. The GREATER SIGMOID CAVITY is embraced between the coronoid and olecranon processes of that bone. It is divided by a slightly elevated ridge, into two parts, the internal of which is the broadest. It articulates with the lower end of the humerus. The LESSER SIGMOID CAVITY is situated upon the outer side of the coronoid process. It is narrow and concave from before backwards. Its extremities afford attachment to the orbicular ligament of the radius. It articulates with the head of the radius and is covered with cartilage. Lower Extremity. This portion of the ulna is small in size and does not participate in the wrist-joint, since it is separated by a triangular fibro- cartilage. It presents for exam- ination a head, a styloid process, a depression, and a groove. The head is flattened, at its lower portion, and rest upon the triangular fibro-cartilage, but, at its external portion, it is semi-cylindrical in form and is received into the lesser sigmoid cavity of the radius. The styloid process is given off from the inner and back part of the head, and is cylindrical in its form. It affords attachment to the ulno-carpal or the internal ligament of the wrist-joint. Between the head and the styloid process is a marked depression for the attachment of the triangular fibro- cartilage which separates the ulna from the wrist- joint. Behind this depression may also be perceived a groove, in which plays the tendon of the extensor carpi ulnaris muscle. Shaft. * The shaft of the ulna is large and prismatic in form, in its upper portion, while, below, it becomes smaller and more rounded. It is slightly curved forwards, and, at its upper portion, is convex externally, but, below, the convexity is most marked at the internal portion of the bone. It presents for examination an anterior,

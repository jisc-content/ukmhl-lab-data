THE FEMUR. The nutrient foramen is situated in or near the linea asperat at about one-third from its upper extremity, and is directed obliquely from below upwards. Muscles Attached to the Femur. The femur affords attachment to twenty-three muscles, as follows: To its upper fifth, 10 To its shaft, 10 To its lower fifth, 3 Total, 23 Occasionally the tensor vaginae femoris muscle takes its origin from the femur, in which case the total of muscles reaches twen- ty-four. The following table illustrates the points of attachment of these twenty-three muscles : The Fe- mur af- fords at- tachm’t to 23 muscles as fol- lows : 'Attached to the greater trochanter To the lesser trochanter, (8) ■(2) | Gluteus medius.

The femur articulates with three bones, namely: the os inno- minatum, the tibia, and the patella. Development of the Femur. This bone is developed by five centres of ossification, which are distributed as follows:

70 THE SKULL IN GENERAL. TABLE OF SUMMARY. Sup. Maxil- lary. Ethmoid. Frontal Ethmoid Sphenoid Vomer Sup. Maxillary.. Nasal Lachrymal Malar Palate Inf. Turbinated. This diagram is intended to illustrate the formation of the orbital and nasal cavities, and also the various articulations of the ethmoid and the superior maxillary bones. The lines connecting the various bones to the parts designated at the corners of the diagram show, upon the left hand of the page, the formation of the nasal cavities and the orbits, and, upon the right hand, the articulations of the ethmoid and the superior maxillary bones. THE LATERAL REGION OF THE SKULL. The lateral regions of the skull present for examination por- tions of the temporal, parietal, sphenoid, frontal, malar and in- ferior maxillary bones. It also presents three important regions which have received special names, and which are called, respec- tively, the temporal fossa, the zygomatic fossa and the spheno- maxillary fossa. To ascertain the relative proportions of the frontal, the pari- etal, and the occipital regions of the skull, pass a thread from one external auditory meatus to that of the opposite side, across the frontal, the parietal, and the occipital eminences, respectively, and record their measurements. The three principal bony points upon the lateral aspect of the skull are, (i.) The zygomatic arch and the upper portion of the ra^mus of the jaw, the former of which arches over the tem- poral, zygomatic and spheno-maxillary fossae. (2.) The external auditory meatus, which is the external orifice of the bony canal leading to the drum membrane of the tympanum.

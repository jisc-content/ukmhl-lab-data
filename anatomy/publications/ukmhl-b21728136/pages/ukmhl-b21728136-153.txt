THE HUMERUS. 131 Muscles attached. The humerus affords attachment to twenty-five muscles, as follows: The Humer- us affords at- tachment to 25 muscles, as follows: To the upper third of bone, (7) )SUPRA-SPINATUS. Infra-spinatus.

All the muscles which arise from the inner condyle of the hu- merus are flexors or pronators, and are situated on the anterior surface of the forearm, while those arising from the external con- dyle and the external condyloid ridge are extensors and supina- tors, and are situated on the posterior surface of the forearm. Development. The humerus is developed by seven centres of ossification. One of these is for the shaft of the bone, one for the head, one for the greater tuberosity, one for the radial artic- ular surface, one for the trochlear portion of the artic- ular surface, one for the internal condyle, and one for the external condyle. The centre for the shaft appears very early during foetal life, and ossification extends rapidly towards the

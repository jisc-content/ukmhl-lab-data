22 BONES OF THE HEAD. The sphenoid bone presents for examination the following component parts: (i.) A Body. (2.) Three greater processes. (3.) Eleven lesser processes. The 3 GREATER PROCESSES of the sphenoid bone are as fol- lows : (1.) The greater wings. (2.) The lesser wings or “ Processes of Ingrassias.” (3.) The pterygoid processes. The 11 LESSER PROCESSES of the sphenoid bone may be clas- sified as follows: Lesser processes of the sphenoid bone. {Ethmoidal spine. Olivary process. Rostrum or Azygos process. 4 Pairs of processes (8) r i The two posterior clinoid processes. The two anterior clinoid processes. The two middle clinoid processes. The two spinous processes. 4 Total 11 Some of these smaller processes will be found described under the description of the body and the greater processes of the bone, since they exist either as parts of those larger projections or as prominent points.upon the central body of the sphenoid. Body of Sphenoid. The body of the sphenoid bone is cuboid in its shape, but it presents only four free surfaces instead of six, since the two lateral surfaces are continuous with and afford attachment to the greater and the lesser wings and the pterygoid processes of the bone. Upper Surface. The upper surface of the body is situated in the interior portion of the cranium. It presents,from before backwards,the following points deserving of special mention. (1.) The ethmoidal spine, which articulates with the ethmoid bone, and which consists of a horizontal projection, of a pointed shape, from the anterior edge of the body of the sphenoid. (2.) A smooth surface just behind the ethmoidal spine marked by two shallow grooves for the support of the olfac- tory nerves. (3.) The optic groove, which supports the commissure of the optic nerves and which leads, upon either side, to- wards the optic foramen.

ORGAN OF GENERATION. 574 also by the compressor urethrae muscle. Its coats consist of a mucous, an erectile, and a muscular coat. THE UTERUS. The organ of conception is pear-shaped, and is flattened from before backwards. It is situated between the bladder and the rectum, and its neck protrudes into the cavity of the vagina. It is retained in its position, principally, by the broad and the round ligaments of the organ. The uterus presents for examination the following parts, which possess special interest: 1. A fundus. 2. A body. 3. A cervix or neck. 4. A cavity. 5. Eight ligaments. 6. Three coats (a serous, a muscular, a mucous). 7. Vessels and nerves. 8. Appendages. The fundus of the organ is that portion which is directed up- wards. It is broad and covered with peritoneum. The body of the organ is adherent to the bladder in front, at its lower part, and is covered by peritoneum, at the upper part ; behind, it is covered by peritoneum and is in'close relation with the small intestine ; while, at the sides, the Fallopian tubes, the round ligaments, and the ovarian ligaments are attached to it. The neck of the organ affords attachment for the upper end of the vagina. It measures, in length, nearly the same as does the body of the organ, viz., about one and a half inches. The cavity of the uterus is divided into two portions, called the cavities of the body, and of the cervix. The cavity of the body is triangular, and communicates with the two Fallopian tubes. The mucous lining of this cavity pre- sents peculiarities, which will be considered when the mucous membrane of the organ is described. The cavity of the cervix is fusiform, and measures about one inch and a quarter in length. The point of junction of the two cavities is called the os internum, while the lower opening of the cavity, of the cervix is called the os externum. The LIGAMENTS of the uterus are eight in number, and may be divided into two sets as follows:

THE SKULL IN GENERAL. 68 The INNER WALL of the nasal fossae is composed of seven" bones, as follows: Perpendicular plate of the ] Ethmoid bone. Principally by C Above and in front. two bones, \ viz.( Below and behind.. The Vomer. r Rostrum of Sphenoid. By five bones, to a small extent, viz : Nasal spine of Frontal. Crest of Nasal. Crest of Palate. Crest of Superior Max- illary. In front, this septum has a triangular deficiency which is filled up with the so-called cartilage of the septum. The inner wall of the nasal fossae is frequently deflected from the median line to- wards one side, thus encroaching somewhat upon one of the cavities of the nose. The only points of interest perceived upon the surfaces of this septum, are the naso-palatine grooves, and vascular and nervous furrows. The OUTER WALL of each of the nasal fossae is formed by six bones, as follows: f Middle turbinated processes of the Ethmoid bone. In its anterior portion.«{ Internal surface of Superior Max- I illary bone. [Inferior turbinated bone. f Lachrymal bone. In the central portion. ■< Nasal process of the Superior Max- ( illary bone. {Vertical plate of Palate bone. Internal pterygoid plate of Sphe- noid bone. This wall of the nasal fossa presents the following points of interest from above downwards: (i.) The superior turbinated bone of the ethmoid. (2.) The superior meatus of the nose, into which open the ori- fice of the sphenoidal sinus, the posterior ethmoidal sinuses, and the spheno-palatine foramen. This meatus consists of a short, irregular, longitudinal passage, and is situated at the upper and posterior portion of the nasal fossa. (3.) The middle turbinated bone of the ethmoid. (4.) The middle meatus of the nose, which is of greater length than the superior, and into which open the orifices of the antrum, the anterior ethmoidal cells and the frontal sinus. (5.) The inferior turbinated bone. The OUTER wall of the nasal fossa is composed of six" bones, as follows :

THE ULNA. 133 apex, a base, and four surfaces, an upper, under, inner and outer. The apex is curved slightly upwards, and, during flexion of the forearm, is received into the coronoid fossa of the humerus. The base is broad and is continuous with the shaft of the ulna. The upper surface is concave, from before back- wards, and serves the purpose of articulation with the humerus. The under surface is concave, and is roughened for the attachment of the brachialis anticus muscle and for the oblique ligament. The inner surface is roughened, and is excavated for the attachment of the flexor profundus digitorum. It presents, anteriorly and from above downwards, the fol- lowing points of interest: 1. A prominent bony mar- gin for the attachment of the internal lateral ligament of the elbow-joint. 2. A tubercle, for the attachment of the middle head of the flexor sublimis digitorum. 3. A ridge, for the attachment of the head of the pronator radii teres. The outer surface gives origin to a few fibres of the supinator brevis, and, above, it forms the lesser sig- moid cavity of the ulna. The OLECRANON PROCESS of the bone is large in size, and is also, like the coronoid process, slightly curved. It presents for examination an apex, a base, an an- terior, a posterior, and an upper surface, and an inner and an outer border. The apex is a prominent portion of bone which, during extension of the fore-arm, is received into the olecranon fossa of the humerus. The base is continuous with the shaft of the ulna. The anterior surface is concave, and articulates with the lower end of the humerus. The posterior surface is triangular, and forms the point of the elbow, when that joint is flexed. It is usually covered by a bursa. The upper surface is roughened, at its posterior por- tion, for the insertion of the triceps muscle, and, in front, close to its margin, it is grooved for the insertion of the posterior ligament of the elbow-joint.

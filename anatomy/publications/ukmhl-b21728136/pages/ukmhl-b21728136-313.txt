MUSCLES OF THE HAND. 291 Upon the back of the wrist the extensor muscles of the thumb have the longest sheaths, although those of the other tendons are seldom less than two inches in length. A peculiar crepitus called “ tenalgia crepitans ” is produced by a local inflammation of the synovial sheaths of these tendons, which is produced by excessive and rapid use of the fingers.

The “ opponent ” muscles of the thumb and little finger are called also “ flexor ossis metacarpi,” when spoken of by some anatomists, since that name also indicates their action.

The glands of this mucous membrane are of a simple tubular and also of a conglomerate character. A large collection of glands, called the arytenoid glands, exist in the aryteno-epiglot- tidean folds ; and, in the sacculus laryngis, some sixty separate glands exist. Vessels. The vessels include branches of the superior thyroid and the inferior thyroid arteries, the superior, middle, and inferior thyroid veins, and lymphatic vessels. N ERVES. The nerves comprise the superior laryngeal and the inferior or recurrent laryngeal nerves, both of which are derived from the pneumogastric nerve, and filaments from the sympathetic. The superior laryngeal nerve enters the cavity of the larynx through a hole in the thyro-hyoid membrane, and is distributed to the mucous lining of the organ and to the crico-thyroid and the arytenoid muscles. The inferior or recurrent laryngeal nerve enters the cavity of the larynx, at its posterior portion, passing behind the articula- tion of the inferior cornu of the thyroid cartilage and the exter- nal surface of the cricoid cartilage. It supplies all the muscles of phonation, with the exception of the crico-thyroid muscle.

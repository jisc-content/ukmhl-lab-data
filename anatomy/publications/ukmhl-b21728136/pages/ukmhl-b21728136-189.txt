STRUCTURE OF JOINTS. 167 ARTHROLOGY OR SYNDESMOLOGY. The name articulation, synonymous with joint, is given, in descriptive anatomy, to the connection subsisting, in the recent skeleton, between any of the denser component parts, whether bone or cartilage. Articulations or joints may be arranged in three classes, as follows: I. Synarthrosis, (immovable) 4 varieties. C Dentata. Suture. â– < Serrata. ( Limbosa Harmon ia. Schindylesis. w Gomphosis. II. Amphiarthrosis, synchondrosis, or symphysis, (limited motion.) SEnarthrosis (ball and socket joint.) Ginglymus (hinge joint.) Arthrodia (gliding joint.) The following structures enter into the formation, to a greater or less extent, of all the joints : 1. Bone, (articular lamella.) 2. Ligaments. 3. Cartilage, (articular, costal, or membraniform.) 4. Fibro-cartilage. 5. Synovial membrane. The LIGAMENTS are usually composed of white fibrous tissue, although two ligaments of the body are composed purely of yellow elastic tissue. These two ligaments are the ligamentum sub-flava and the ligamentum nuchse, both of which are connected with the vertebral column. Ligaments may be divided into three principal classes: 1st, capsular; 2nd, fascicular ; 3rd, funicular. Capsular ligaments (from capsula, a small coffer or box) are barrel-shaped expansions, attached by their extremities around the margin' of the articulating surfaces composing the joint. Funicular ligaments {funis, a rope) are those which resemble a cord in their appearance. Fascicular ligaments (fascis, a bundle) are flattened bands, more or less expanded, somewhat like a riband, and comprise the remaining varieties. CARTILAGE is divided into two varieties, viz., temporary and permanent. The latter is divided into (1) articular, (2) costal, (3) membraniform. Articular cartilage is either disposed as a thin layer between two articular surfaces, or it forms an encrustation upon the artic-

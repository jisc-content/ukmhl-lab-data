MYOLOGY. 238 3. From the fascia lumborum. 4. From the inner surfaces of the cartilages of the lower six ribs. Insertion. 1. Into the linea semi-lunaris and the linea alba, after joining with the posterior lamella of the apon- eurosis of the internal oblique muscle. 2. Into the crest of the pubes, the pubic end of Poupart’s ligament, and the linea pectinea, (thus help- ing to form the conjoined tendonl) 3. The internal portion of the muscle passes behind and beneath the spermatic cord, and is inserted subse- quently into Poupart’s ligament. Nervous supply. Lower intercostal nerves. Cremaster. 1. From the middle portion of Poupart’s ligament. 2. Behind the pubic insertion of that ligament. Insertion. By successive loops, the spermatic cord is surround- ed as well as the testicle and the tunica vaginalis. Nervous supply. The genito-crural nerve. Action. To suspend the testicle. ACTION OF THE ABDOMINAL MUSCLES. The abdominal muscles, when the pelvis and thorax are made fixed points, exert a powerful influence, during their contraction, t upon the abdominal viscera, and in these acts the diaphragm be- comes also a powerful adjunct. Thus, in the act of vomiting, and in the expulsion of the foetus from the womb, the act of defecation, or the evacuation of the urine from the bladder, (in cases where any obstruction to the free exit of their contents exists), a long breath is usually taken before the abdominal muscles contract ; since, by so doing, the dia- phragm presents a state of tension eminently calculated to direct the entire force of their contraction upon the viscera. They also assist in expiration, by depressing the lower part of the thorax, when the spine is made a fixed point; and, in cases where the spine is relaxed, they tend to flex the thorax upon the pelvis, if both sides act simultaneously, or, if not, they produce a lateral displacement of the thorax, with a partial rotation of the trunk towards the side opposite to the muscles in contraction.

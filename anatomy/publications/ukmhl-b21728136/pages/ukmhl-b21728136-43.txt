21 SPHENOID BONE. The foramina in the occipital bone vary from three to five in number since three are constant and two are variable. The two posterior condyloid foramina are often absent, but the two anterior condyloid foramina and the foramen 'magnum are constant both in their location and in the structures which they transmit. Articulation of the Occipital Bone. The occipital bone articulates with six bones of tne skull, which may be enumerated as follows : ) Atlas. Sphenoid. ( The Temporal bones. 2 pairs of bones (4) •< ( The Parietal bones. Total 6 Development of the Occipital Bone. The occipital bone has four centres of development: one for the posterior or the occipital portion, one for each condyle, and one for the basilar process of the bone. At birth the bone con- sists of four separate parts as indicated by the location of the cen- tres of ossification. At about the fourth year, the two condyloid portions join with the occipital portion, and two years later the basilar process becomes joined, thus completing the entire bone. Articulations of the Occipital bone." THE SPHENOID BONE. The sphenoid bone is situated at the anterior portion of the base of the skull and is wedged in between the other bones of the cranium. In shape it resembles a bat with its wings outstretched. It possesses 12 foramina, 12 pairs of muscles, 10 points of ossification, and it articulates with 12 bones. The sphenoid bone enters into the formation of the following important anatomical regions. (The cavity of the Cranium. A. Five cavities •< “ “ “ both Orbits. ( “ “ “ both Nasal fossae. B.

ANGIOLOGY. 3^4 Vascular Supply of the Pharynx. The pharynx is supplied with blood by the following vessels. 1. Inferior or ascending palatine artery (branch of the facial). 2. Posterior or descending palatine artery (branch of the inter- nal maxillary). 3. Spheno-palatine artery (branch of the internal maxillary). 4. Pterygo-palatine artery (branch of the internal maxillary). 5. Ascendingpharangeal (branch of the internal carotid). 6. Small branches from the following arteries. Dorsalis lingua (branch of the lingual). Tonsillar artery (branch of the facial). Vidian artery (branch of the internal maxillary). Vascular Supply of the Tympanum. The tympanum receives its blood chiefly from the following sources. 1. The tympanic branch of the internal maxillary, which enters at the Glaserian fissure. 2. The tympanic branch of the internal carotid, which enters through a small foramen within the carotid canal. 3. The stylo-mastoid artery (a branch of the posterior auricular), which enters the acqueductus Fallopii through the stylo-mastoid foramen. 4. The vidian artery (a branch of the internal maxillary), which passes through the vidian canal and accompanies the large petrossal nerve through the hiatus Fallopii. 5. The petrosal branch of the middle meningeal artery, which enters at the hiatus Fallopii. 6. Branches from the ascending pharangeal artery, which enter the tympanum along the Eustachian tube.

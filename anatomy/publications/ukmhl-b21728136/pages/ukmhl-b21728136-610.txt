582 ORGAN OF SIGHT. The vitreous humor is a thick albuminous fluid, which, in the foetus, is characterized by a reticulated structure within its sub- stance; but in the adult, it is destitute of any internal struc- ture. The ciliary muscle of the eye is a ring of involuntary muscular tissue, which is situated at the anterior part of the choroid coat and upon the outer side of the ciliary processes. It is of great physiological importance, since it serves to adjust the vision to distances, by altering the shape of the lens of the eye by the pressure which it exerts upon it. The ligamentum pectinatum is a fibrous band, which unites the middle and outer coats of the eye, although it is also connected with the posterior elastic layer of the cornea and the iris, into the latter of which it gives off fibres, from whose appearance the lig- ament receives its name. APPENDAGES TO THE EYE AND LACHRYMAL APPARATUS. The eye has the following appendages, which demand a sepa- rate description. The eyebrows. The eyelids. The conjunctiva. The eyebrows consist of a thickened fold of integument, which is covered with hair and which corresponds to the upper edge of the orbital cavity. The eyelids are two movable folds, which afford a protective covering to the eyeball and which are joined at either extremity, where their angles of junction are called the external and the in- ternal canthus. The external angle of the eyelids is higher than the internal angle, as a rule, and the size of the fissure between the eyelids gives the appearance of increased size to the eyes, which is often mistaken for an actual rather than an apparent increase of de- velopment. The inner canthus of the eye presents the following points which have been specially named: ^ The lacus lachrymalis. The caruncula lachrymalis. The plica semilunaris. The lacus lachrymalis is a triangular space, in wlych is per- ceived the caruncula lachrymalis; and the plica semilunaris

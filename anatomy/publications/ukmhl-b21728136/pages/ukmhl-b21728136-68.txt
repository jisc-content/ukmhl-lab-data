46 BONES OF THE FACE. Development. Ossification of the vomer commences, by a single centre, in a cartilage contained between the two laminae, of which the bone is at first composed. This centre appears at about the same time as those of the vertebrae. THE NASAL BONES. These bones form the bridge of the nose. They are narrow and thick at their upper portion, and wide and thin at their lower extremity. They present for examination two surfaces and four borders. The outer surface of the nasal bone is convex in shape from side to side, and concave from above downwards, especially at its upper portion where it bends to give shape to the nose. It pre- sents several small grooves for arteries and a small foramen which transmits a vein. The inner surface of the bone is inversely curved from the outer surface and presents a groove for the external branch of the nasal nerve. The superior border is thick and narrow and articulates with the frontal bone. The inferior border is broad and thin and is joined to the lateral cartilage of the nose. It presents a notch which transmits the nasal nerve. The external border of the nasal bone articulates with the nasal process of the superior maxillary bone. The internal border of the nasal bone articulates with its fel- low in the mesial line of the face. It is prolonged backwards and upwards into a crest which articulates with the nasal spine of the frontal bone and with the perpendicular plate of the eth- moid bone. Muscles attached. No muscles are directly attached to this bone. Articulation. The Nasal Bone articulates with four bones, as follows: I 2 bones of Cranium... | 2 bones of the Face... I j Frontal. ( Ethmoid. ( Nasal. â€¢J Superior maxil- ( lary. Development. This bone is developed by one centre of ossification.

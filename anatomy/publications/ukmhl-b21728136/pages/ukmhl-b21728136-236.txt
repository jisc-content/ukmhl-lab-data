MYOLOGY. 214 Origin. 1. From the outer surface of the external ptery- goid plate and greater wing of the sphenoid. 2. From the tuherosities of the palate bone and the superior maxillary bone. Insertion. Into a fossa on the anterior surface of the neck of the condyle, and into the edge of the interarticular fibro-cartilage of the temporo-maxillary articulation. Nervous supply. The inferior maxillary division of the 5th cranial nerve. The internal maxillary artery passes between its two heads. Internal Pterygoid. Origin. 1. From a fossa between the two pterygoid plates of the sphenoid bone. 2. From the hamular process of the sphenoid bone. 3. From the tuberosity of the palate bone. Insertion. Into the angle and inner surface of the lower jaw, as high as the dental foramen. Nervous supply. A branch from the anterior division of the inferior maxillary nerve. The first two muscles of this group tend to shut the lower jaw tightly upon the upper jaw. The last two muscles of this group tend to create a horizontal motion of the lower jaw, when acting alternately upon either side and not conjointly. The gustatory, dental and chorda tympani nerves lie in close relation to the internal pterygoid muscle, as do also the internal maxillary artery and vein. ACTION OF THE MUSCLES OF THE HEAD. The muscles of the head may be classified secondly, on a basis of the function chiefly performed by them as follows: I. Muscles of expression, 20 pairs and 1 single muscle, under which may be enumerated: The epicranial group “ auricular “ “ palpebral “ “ nasal “ “ labial “ Total, I pair. 3 pairs. 3 “ 4 “ _9 “ 20 “ of muscles.

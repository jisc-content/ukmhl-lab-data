The SHORT BONES are situated where great solidity, a limited amount of motion, and compactness are required. The FLAT BONES are important agents in the protection of the organs, contained within the various cavities of the body, as in the cranium, thorax, and pelvis, and from their shape they serve to give extensive attachment to muscles. The following table will serve to show the regions of the body where each of these four varieties of bones predominates.

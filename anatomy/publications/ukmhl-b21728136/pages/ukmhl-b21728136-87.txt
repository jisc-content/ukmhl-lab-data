THE ORBITS. 65 (2.) A depression for the pulley of the Superior oblique muscle of the eye. Floor of the orbit. (1.) The infra-orbital groove, posteriorly. (2.) The infra-orbital canal, anteriorly. (3.) A depression, for the inferior oblique muscle of the eye. Inner wall of the orbit. (1.) A groove for the lachrymal sac. (2.) The crest of the lachrymal bone for the tensor tarsi muscle. Outer wall of the orbit. (1.) The orifices of the malar canals. (2.) A small spine for the attachment of the external rectus muscle of the eye. Superior external angle of the orbit. (1.) The articulation of the frontal and malar bones. (2.) The articulation of the frontal bone and the greater wing of the sphenoid bone. (3.) The sphenoidal fissure or foramen lacerum anterius. Superior internal angle of the orbit. (1.) A suture between the frontal bone and the lachrymal and ethmoid bones. (2.) The anterior ethmoidal canal. (3.) The posterior ethmoidal canal. . Inferior external angle of the orbit. (1. The spheno-maxillary fissure. This transmits the infra-orbital vessels and nerves and the ascending branches of Meckelâ€™s ganglion. Inferior internal angle of the orbit. (1.) A suture, formed by the articulation of the superior max- illary and palate bones, below, with the lachrymal and ethmoid bones, above. Circumference of the orbit. (1.) The supra-orbital notch or foramen. Apex of the orbit. (1.) The optic foramen, which is formed by the two roots of the lesser wing of the sphenoid bone. To the upper root is attached the common tendon of the muscles of the eye. Each of these various points of interest has already been pre^ viously described, in detail, in the accounts given of the special bones with which they are connected. It has not been deemed necessary therefore, to enter again into the purposes of many of

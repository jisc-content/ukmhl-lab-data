ORGAN OF NEARING. 59 A membrana basilaris. It is not as large a canal as the scala tym- pani, since the scala media is cut off from it by a membrane, called the membrane of Reissner. The scala vestibuli communicates with the cavity of the vestibule; and, at the apex of the cochlea, the two scalae communicate with each other, in a space, called the helicotrema, created by the absence of the lamina spiralis in the last half coil of the canal. The scala media is a triangular portion of the space above the lamina spiralis and the membrane basilaris, which is separated from the scala vestibuli by a membrana, called the membrane of Reissner, and which contains the organ of hearing, called from its discoverer the organ of Corti. This space has been described by some authors under the names of the canalis cochlea, and the canalis membranacea. The following diagram will perhaps make the construction of the three divisions of the spiral canal of the cochlea more clearly understood by the student.

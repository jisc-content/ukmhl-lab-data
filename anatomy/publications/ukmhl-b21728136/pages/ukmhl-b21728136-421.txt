ARTERIES OF TEE TRUNK. 399 of the forearm, made in the region of four inches below the joint* four arteries of medium calibre would require a ligature. The anterior carpal branch of the ulnar joins, beneath the deep flexor tendons, the same branch of the radial artery. The posterior carpal branch of the ulnar artery helps to form the posterior carpal arch beneath the extensor tendons of the forearm. The communicating branch of the ulnar artery, by its junction with the main trunk of the radial artery, completes the deep pal- mar arch. The superficial palmar interosseous branches, called also digital branches, are usually four in number, and join with the deep pal- mar interosseous branches which arise from the deep palmar arch. The trunks so formed divide, at the clefts between the fingers, to form digital branches to three and a half fingers on the inner side of the hand. ARTERIES OF THE TRUNK. THORACIC AORTA. The aorta, at the termination of the descending portion of the arch, descends through the posterior mediastinum of the chest, curving slightly forwards and towards the right side, and passing through the aortic opening of the diaphragm, situated in front of the 12th dorsal vertebra, it becomes the abdominal aorta. The so-called thoracic portion of the aorta exclusive of the arch which is properly a part of the thoracic aorta, may then be said to extend from the lower border of the 4th dorsal vertebra to the 12th dorsal vertebra. Relations. The dorsal portion of the thoracic aorta has the following re- lations, within the thorax.

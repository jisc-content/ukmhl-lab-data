ANGIOLOGY. 3*4 The supra-acromial branch anastomoses, upon the acromion process of the scapula, with the acromial thoracic branch of the axillary artery. THE TRANSVERSALIS COLLI ARTERY. This artery is one of the branches of the thyroid axis. It crosses the scalenus anticus muscle and the phrenic nerve, passes beneath the omo-hyoid muscle, pierces between the main branches of the brachial plexus of nerves, and is distributed to the trapezius muscle. It gives off two principal branches as follows. Superficial cervical. Posterior scapular. The superficial cervical branch is distributed to muscles, glands, and the integument. The posterior scapular artery may be either a branch of the transversalis colli or of the third portion of the subclavian artery. Some authorities report a percentage of relative frequency in favor of the latter point as its normal seat of origin. This vessel runs downwards along the posterior margin of the scapula as far as the inferior angle of that bone. It supplies the neighboring muscles of the back and anastomoses with the sub- scapular\ the supra-scapular and the posterior branches of the neighboring intercostal arteries. INTERNAL MAMMARY ARTERY. This artery arises from the anterior and lower part of the subclavian, close to the inner margin of the scalenus anticus mus- cle. It passes downwards within the cavity of the thorax, par- allel with the edge of the sternum, but lying about one-half an inch to the outer side of it. At its point of origin, it is covered, like the other large branches of the subclavian artery, by the internal jugular vein. This vessel also passes behind the subclavian vein and is crossed in front, by the phrenic nerve. It is accompanied in the chest by two veins for the greater portion of its course, but, in the upper part of the chest, these veins unite to form a single vein. The internal mammary artery terminates, at the interval be- tween the 6th and 7th ribs, by dividing into its two terminal branches.

BONES OF THE HEAD. 40 The stylo-glossus muscle. The stylo-hyoid ligament. The stylo-maxillary ligament. (io.) The stylo-mastoid foramen. This foramen transmits the facial nerve and the stylo- mastoid artery. (u.) A rough surface which affords attachment to the levator palati and the tensor tympani muscles. (12.) The auricular fissure for the exit of the auricular branch of the pneumogastric nerve. (13.) The opening of the Aquceductus Cochlece. This foramen is situated in front of and to the inner side of the jugular fossa, near to the posterior border of the petrous portion of the temporal bone. Borders of the Petrous Portion. The superior border is situated within the cavity of the skull and forms the line of separation between the anterior and the middle fossce at the base of the skull. It is grooved for the superior petrosal sinus and affords at- tachment, throughout its entire length, to the tentorium cerebelli. The posterior border is grooved for the inferior petrosal sinus in front, and, behind, it assists in forming the jugular foramen. The anterior border articulates, at its inner part, with the spinous process of the sphenoid bone, while, at its outer part, it is joined to the squamous portion of the temporal bone. At the point of junction of the squamous and the petrous por- tions of the temporal, at the retiring angle between them, is perceived the canal for the tensor tympani muscle, and the osseous portion of the Eustachian tube. Up6n the outer side of the opening for the Eustachian tube is also perceived a small opening, called the canal of Huguier, which transmits the chorda tympani nerve. Muscles attached to the Temporal Bone. The 14 muscles attached to the temporal bone may be clas- sified as follows:

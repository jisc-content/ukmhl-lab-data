546 ORGANS OF RESPIRATION. length of the oesophagus, which fact may help the memory of the student, in recalling either of the three. The trachea is very deeply situated in the lower portion of the neck, and is reached with difficulty except at its upper part, since, in cases of extreme dyspnoea, the head is usually drawn forwards, and the approximation of the chin to the sternum shortens the working space for the Surgeon. In addition, the swelling of the thyroid veins, and the rigidity of the sternal mus- cles add to the difficulties of reaching the trachea. The distance between the lower border of the larynx and the upper border of the sternum is modified greatly by the position of the head, but it measures only one and a half inches in the normal attitude, and when the head is fully extended, three quar- ters of an inch is added. It will thus be perceived that only about eight rings of the trachea are above the sternum. The relations of the trachea within the neck and the thorax are important, and may be enumerated as follows : In front. The isthmus of the thyroid gland. The arteria thyroidea ima. The inferior thyroid vein. The remains of the thymus gland. The left vena innominata. The arch of the aorta. The arteria innominata and the left common carotid artery. The great cardiac plexus. The bifurcation of the pulmonary artery. The sternum, sternal muscles, fascia, and integument. Behind. The oesophagus. The right recurrent laryngeal nerve. Laterally. The lateral lobes of the thyroid gland. The common carotid arteries. The internal jugular veins. The pneumogastric and sympathetic nerves. The inferior thyroid arteries.

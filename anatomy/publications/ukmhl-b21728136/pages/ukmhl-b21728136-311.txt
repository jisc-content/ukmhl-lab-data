MUSCLES OF THE FOREARM. 289 ACTION OF THE MUSCLES OF POSTERIOR SUR- FACE OF FOREARM. The muscles situated upon the posterior surface of the fore- arm may be thus classified, as to their action. 2 " Action. Superficial lay- er (7) .Deeplayer....

Two supinate the hand. Three extend the hand. Three extend the fingers. Three extend the thumb. All the pronators and supinators are inserted into the radius, principally on its outer border. NERVOUS SUPPLY OF THE MUSCLES OF THE POS- TERIOR SURFACE OF THE FOREARM. All the posterior muscles of the forearm are supplied with nerve power from the musculo spiral nerve or its interosseous branch. ACTION OF THE MUSCLES OF THE FOREARM IN GENERAL. The action of the muscles of the forearm will be considered, in detail, later on in connection with the muscles of the hand. The muscles on the anterior surface of the forearm are flexors

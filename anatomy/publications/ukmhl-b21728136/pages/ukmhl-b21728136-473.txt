In front of the praecuneus may also be perceived a region called the para-central lobule, because it corresponds in situation with the DIAGRAM OF BRAIN IN LONGITUDINAL MEDIAN SECTION. 1.

The most important feature pertaining to the inner surface of the cerebrum is a convolution which lies immediately above the corpus callosum. It is called the gyrus fornicatus, because it has an arched or vaulted form; and it encircles the corpus callosum, the cerebral ganglia, and the crus cerebri in a continuous longi- tudinal curve. It starts from the inferior part of the anterior lobe, just in front of the Sylvian fissure, and winds around the anterior extremity of the corpus callosum, and along its upper border. Here it is included between the corpus callosum, below, and the fissura calloso-marginalis above. It extends backward, in this part of its course, as a single independent convolution, as far as the ascend- ing branch of the fissura calloso-marginalis. It then curves round the posterior extremity of the corpus callosum, passes beneath

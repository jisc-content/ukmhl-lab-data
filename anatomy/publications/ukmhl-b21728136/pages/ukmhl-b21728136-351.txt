MUSCLES OF LO WER EXTREM1T Y. 329 The following table indicates the number of muscles divided in amputation either at the hip, knee or ankle joints : A Table Illustrating the Muscles Divided in Amputa- tions THROUGH THE PRINCIPAL JOINTS OF THE LOWER Extremity.

This table is constructed for the purpose of enabling the stu- dent to ascertain the names and numbers of the muscles divided in cases of amputation through the principal joints of the lower extremity. The horizontal lines represent the segment of the limb. The oblique lines represent the group of muscles passing from one segment to another, and opposite which are their names. In order to ascertain the number of muscles divided in am- putation through any joint, the knife of the surgeon, placed be- tween the various segments, necessarily intersects two or more oblique lines. Add up the respective number at the lower end of each one of these lines, and the sum will indicate the number of muscles divided. A more detailed explanation of this table, however, will be found appended to a similarly arranged table under the chapter upon the muscles of the upper extremity on page 298 of this work.

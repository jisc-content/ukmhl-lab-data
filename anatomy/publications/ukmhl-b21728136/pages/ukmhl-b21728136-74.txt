52 BONES OF THE FACE. Articulations. The lachrymal bone articulates with four bones as follows: Articulations of the Lachrymal Bone. 2 bones of Cranium. 2 bones of Face. Development. Total, 4 \ Frontal. } Ethmoid, j Superior maxillary. I Inferior turbinated. The lachrymal bone is developed from one centre of ossi- fication. THE MALAR BONES. These bones of the face enter into the formation of the cavi- ties of the orbits, the temporal fossae, and the zygomatic fossae. They are situated at the outer sides and upper portion of the face, and they present for examination two surfaces, three pro- cesses and four borders. (i.) The outer surface. This portion of the bone is convex in form and affords attach- ment to the zygomatic muscles. Upon it, is perceived a small foramen which transmits the malar branch of the temporo-malar nerve. (2.) The inner surface. This surface articulates with the superior maxillary bone, internally, and, externally, it is concave and assists in form- ing the temporal and zygomatic fossae. It also presents a fora- men which transmits the temporal branch, of the orbital or tem- poro-malar nerve. (3.) The orbital process. This portion of the malar bone projects backwards, and thus forms a portion of the outer wall and of the floor of the orbit and also a portion of the temporal fossa. It articulates, from above downwards,with the frontal, the sphenoid,and the superior max- illary bones. It bounds the spheno-maxillary fissure, anteriorly, and presents one or two small temporo-malar foramina. (4.) The frontal process. This process of the bone is thick and directed vertically up- wards. It serves for the purpose of articulation with the external angular process of the frontal bone. (5.) The zygomatic process. This portion of the malar bone is long and is directed hori- zontally backwards. It articulates with the zygomatic process of the temporal bone.

Behind, by the anterior margin of the sterno-mastoid muscle. Above, by the anterior border of the omo-hyoid muscle. The floor is formed by the longus colli and scalenus anticus muscles. Superior Carotid Triangle. Above, by the posterior belly of the digastric muscle. Behindy by the sterno-mastoid muscle. Below, by the anterior belly of the omo-hyoid muscle. Submaxillary Triangle.

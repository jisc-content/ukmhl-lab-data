346 ANGIOLOGY. Collateral Circulation. The arteria innominata, if tied, no longer furnishes blood to the right side of the head or to the right upper extremity. Cer- tain indirect channels are therefore forced to carry an additional amount of blood to supply these parts with proper nutrition. The various points of collateral circulation, which are found to exist when a subject is injected, whose arteria innominata has previously been ligated, are as follows. 1. A regurgitant current through the circle of Willis, by means of the left carotid and vertebral arteries, which fills the vessels of the right side immediately after the applica- tion of the ligature. 2. The carotids of both sides anastomose, by means oC,their branches which meet in the median line. These branches are as follows : The superior thyroid arteries. The lingual arteries. The facial arteries. The internal maxillary arteries. The occipital arteries. The temporal arteries. 3. The subclavian artery derives blood directly from the anastomosis of the following vessels. Superior intercostal with first aortic intercostal. Profunda cervicis with princeps cervicis. Lower intercostals with internal mammary branches. Lower intercostals with axillary branches. Internal mammary with deep epigastric artery. The two inferior thyroid arteries with each other. COMMON CAROTID ARTERIES. The two common carotid arteries differ in their points of ori- gin upon the right and the left side of the neck. The right common carotid arises, as one of the branches of bifurcation of the arteria innominata, behind the right sterno- clavicular articulation ; while the left common carotid arises from the highest part of the aorta, and has therefore a thoracic and a cervical portion. The thoracic portion of the left common carotid artery is deeply situated and terminates at the root of the neck.

601 OPERA TION OF LA TERAL LITHOTOMY. PARTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE OPERATION OF LATERAL LITHOTOMY. In the operation of lateral lithotomy, certain structures are of necessity wounded, and certain structures should be carefully avoided. The central tendinous point of the perineum corresponds to a locality, situated, externally, midway between the junction of the scrotum with the perineum, and the centre of the anus. In the operation of lithotomy, the incision should never be carried above this point, since the membranous portion of the urethra lies im- mediately behind it. The parts, which are divided in this operation, are as follows: 1. Integument. 2. Superficial fascia. 3. Inferior hemorrhoidal vessels and nerves. 4. Superficial perineal vessels and nerves. 5. Transversus perinei muscle. 6. Accelerator urinae muscle (posterior fibres). 7. Deep perineal fascia (anterior layer). 8. Compressor urethrae muscle. 9. Levator ani muscle (anterior fibres). 10. Membranous and prostatic portions of urethra. 11. Prostate gland and posterior layer of the deep perineal fascia. The structures, which are to be especially avoided, are as follows : 1. The bulb of the urethra and its artery. 2. The rectum. 3. The pudic artery. 4. Entire division of the prostate gland. The first, of these four structures, is to be avoided by keeping the incision as far backwards as possible, without endangering other structures. The rectum is to be avoided, by not carrying the incision too far backwards. The pudic artery is to be avoided, by not carrying the incision too far outwards. The width of the incision in the prostate gland is to be regu- lated by the size of the cutting instrument, and, if a scalpel be used, by not allowing the incision of the deeper structures to be carried too far backwards.

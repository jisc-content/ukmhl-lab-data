345 BRANCHES OF AORTIC ARCH. ARTERIA INNOMINATA. This artery arises from the transverse arch of the aorta at an average distance of three and a half inches from the aortic valve. It is separated by an interval of less than one half of an inch from its adjoining branch, viz., the left common carotid artery. In calibre it exceeds or equals the combined areas of the four remaining branches of the arch of the aorta. Its average length is about one inch and a half. The arteria innominata terminates at the right sterno-clavicu- lar articulation, behind and between the two points of origin of the sterno-mastoid muscle. At this point, it bifurcates into the right common carotid and the right subclavian arteries, the former arising from the anterior portion of the arteria innominata, while the latter forms a direct continuation of the curve of that vessel. The course of the arteria innominata corresponds to a line drawn from the middle of the sternum, at the point of junction of the manibrium and the gladiolus, to the right sterno-clavicular articulation.

Inferior cervical cardiac branch of right pneumogastric nerve. Right side. Right vena innominata. Right pneumogastric nerve. Pleura. Left side. Remains of thymus gland. Left carotid artery. Behind. Trachea. The inferior thyroid veins cross the artery low down near its seat of origin. The muscles, designated in the table of relations, separate the upper portion of the artery from the sternum, while the thymus gland and the innominate vein separate its middle portion from the sternum.

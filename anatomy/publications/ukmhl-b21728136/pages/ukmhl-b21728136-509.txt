the dorsal nerves. 48 s SUMMARY OF THE NERVES OF THE DORSAL REGION. In the preceding table, which illustrates the distribution of the nerves of the dorsal region, it will be perceived that the largest proportion of the branches are distributed to the muscles of the back, the muscles of the abdomen, and the integument of the trunk in general. The integumentary distribution of special nerves is rapidly assuming a great practical importance, since, by a thorough knowledge of these branches, lesions of nerve trunks and of the spinal cord itself can often be localized with precision. The posterior divisions of the dorsal nerves are distributed to the muscles and integument, chiefly of the back ; while the anterior divisions of the dorsal nerves are distributed to the thoracic and abdominal muscles and to the integument of the various regions of the chest and abdomen. The first intercostal nerve enters almost entirely into the formation of the brachial plexus; but it gives off also an inter- costal branch which runs along the first intercostal space and terminates at the front part of the thorax. The lateral cutaneous branch of the second intercostal nerve, perforates the second intercostal space and is called the intercostol- humeral nerve. It either joins with the nerve of Wrisberg, after crossing the axillary space, or it supplies the place of that nerve in case it be wanting.

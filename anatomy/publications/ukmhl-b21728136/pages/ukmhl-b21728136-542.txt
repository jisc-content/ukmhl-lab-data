ORGANS OF DIGESTION. 514 THE ORGANS OF DIGESTION. Digestion of food is carried on within a group of connecting organs, termed the alimentary canal. Associated with it are cer- tain accessory organs, that also contribute greatly to the proper performance of digestion and assimilation. The alimentary canal, if considered as an individual structure, is a musculo-membranous tube, which is lined throughout with a mucous membrane, and which extends from the mouth, above, to the anus, below. Its length has been variously estimated from twenty-seven to thirty feet, and its different component parts have each received a special name. In the mouth, we find provision made for the mechanical di- vision of the food (mastication), and, through the glands of the mouth, for the admixture of a fluid, the saliva; between this point and the stomach, are comprised the organs of deglutition, viz., the pharynx and oesophagus, which convey the food to the stomach; in the cavity of the stomach, chemical changes occur, and the reduction and solution of some of the elements of food takes place; in the small intestine, which is connected with the stomach, the admixture of bile and the pancreatic fluid occurs, by which complete digestion of food is accomplished, and most of its nutritive properties are here absorbed, through the blood- vessels and lacteals; finally, in the large intestine, the waste mat- ter contained within the food is voided, and, to a certain extent, excretion of waste products is carried on. The following table shows the subdivisions of the alimentary canal and the accessory organs connected with it. Alimentary Canal. {Duodenum. Jejunum. Ileum. ! Caecum. Colon. Rectum. Accessory Organs.

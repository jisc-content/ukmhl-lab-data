ARTHR0L0GY OR SYNDESM0L0GY. 170 4. Abduction. 5. Rotation. 6. Circumduction. 7. Gliding movement. In the first two of these movements, the hinge and ball-and socket joints are most prominently useful. In the next four, the ball-and-socket joints are most chiefly used, while, in the latter, the arthrodial joints are alone implicated. The articular lamella differs from the ordinary bone tissue (1) in containing no Haversian canals, (2) its lacunae are larger, (3) it contains no canaliculi. A. ^ITICULATIONS OF THE CRANIUM WITH THE SPINE. These include the occipito-atloid, the occipito-axoid, and the atlo-axoid articulations. The latter, although not directly affect- ing the head, cannot well be separated from this group. Occipito-atloid Articulation. This joint is a double arthrodia between the condyles of the occipital bone and the superior articular surfaces of the atlas. Its ligaments are seven in number, as follows : Two anterior occipito-atloid. A posterior occipito-atloid. Two lateral occipito-atloid. Two capsular. The anterior ligaments are two in number, viz. : the superficial,' which springs from the basilar process of the occipital bone, and is attached to the anterior tubercle of the atlas ; and the deep, which extends from the anterior margin of the foramen magnum to the upper border of the anterior arch of the atlas. The posterior ligament extends from the posterior margin of the foramen magnum to the upper border of the pos- terior arch of the atlas. It is perforated by the vertebral arteries and sub- occipital nerves. The lateral ligaments extend from the jugular processes of the occipital bone to the base of each of the transverse processes of the atlas. The capsular ligaments surround the arthrodial articulations, and are lined by a synovial membrane, which often

553 THYROID GLAND. is brought in close relation with the subclavian artery, and the scaleni muscles. The arteries of the pleurae are derived from the following sources. 1. The intercostal arteries. 2. The internal mammary arteries. 3. The phrenic arteries. 4. The inferior thyroid arteries. 5. The pericardiac arteries. 6. The bronchial arteries. The veins, which return the blood from the pleurae, follow the same general course as the arteries. The lymphatic vessels of the parietal layers of the pleurae, join with those of the mediastina and the walls of the thorax; while those of the visceral layers empty into the lymphatic vessels of the lung. Thp nerves, which supply the pleurae, are derived from the two pulmonary plexuses, which lie in relation with the roots of the lungs ; a few filaments from the phrenic nerves and from the sympathetic, however, directly supply it. THE THYROID GLAND. This gland lies in front of the upper part of the trachea, and at the sides of the oesophagus, the lower portion of the pharynx, and the larynx. It is soft in consistence, brownish in color, and is very vascular. Its average weight is about one and a half ounces, although it is usually somewhat larger in females than in males. This gland, at its lateral portions, covers entirely or in part, the following structures. 1. The common carotid arteries. 2. The inferior thyroid arteries. 3. The internal jugular veins. 4. The pneumogastric nerves. 5. The recurrent laryngeal nerves. 6. The filaments of the sympathetic. The thyroid gland presents for examination the following points of interest. 1. Two lateral lobes. 2. A connecting band called “ the isthmus.” 3. A small lobe called “ the pyramid.”

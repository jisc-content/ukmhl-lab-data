459 THE CEREBELLUM. thus be more clearly understood why injury to this ganglion is so rapidly fatal. THE CEREBELLUM. This ganglion of the brain is situated within the posterior fossa of the skull, and is in close relation, in front, with the medulla oblongata ; while, above, it is separated from the occipital lobe of the cerebrum by the tentorium cerebelli. In shape, this ganglion is oblong, from side to side, and flat- tened from above downwards. It therefore presents two surfaces, an upper and an lower surface, and a circumference. The cerebellum consists of two lateral lobes and a central or connecting lobe called the vermiform process. This central lobe is usually described as consisting of two parts, the superior and the inferior portion. Upper Surface of the Cerebellum. This surface presents for examination the following parts, which are specially named and which deserve enumeration. 1. The upper surface of each lateral hemisphere. 2. The superior surface of the vermiform process. Each lateral hemisphere may be seen to present, on its upper surface, two distinct portions. The anterior portion or the square lobe. The posterior portion or the semilunar lobe. The vermiform process, on the upper aspect, is also seen to present three slight elevations called respectively, from before backwards. The lobulus centralis. The monticulus cerebelli. The commissura simplex. Under Surface of the Cerebellum. This surface is rounded and elevated on the sides, and in the centre, it is depressed into a groove between the two lateral lobes of the cerebellum, which depression is called the vallecula or val- ley. It presents, as did the upper surface, the three following parts for examination. 1. The under surface of each lateral hemisphere. 2. The inferior surface of the vermiform process. The lateral hemispheres may be seen to present upon this surface, five distinct lobes, called as follows :

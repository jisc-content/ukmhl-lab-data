224 MYOLOGY. From the articular processes of the 4th. 5th, 6th, and 7th cervical vertebrae. Insertion. Into the occipital bone, between the two curved lines on its inferior surface. Nervous supply. From three sources, viz., the great occipital nerve, the sub-occipital nerve, and the internal branches of the posterior divisions of the cervical nerves. Biventer Cervicis. Origin. From the transverse processes of the three or four upper dorsal vertebrae. Insertion. Into the occipital bone, internal to the attachment of the complexus muscle. Nervous supply. From the same sources as the complexus. This muscle is often described as a fasciculus of the com- plexus muscle. Obliquus Capitis Superior. Origin. PVom the extremity of the transverse process of the atlas. Insertion. Into the occipital bone, between the curved lines on its inferior surface and external to the point of inser- tion of the complexus muscle. Nervous supply. Posterior branch of the sub-occipital nerve. Obliquus Capitis Inferior. Origin. From the spinous process of the axis. Insertion. Into the extremity of the transverse process of the atlas. Nervous supply. From two sources, viz., a branch of the sub-occipital and one from the great occipital nerve. Rectus Capitis Posticus Major. Origin. From the spinous process of the axis.

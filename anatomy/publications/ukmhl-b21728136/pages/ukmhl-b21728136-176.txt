154 BONES OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY. 'To the upper END The tibia af- fords attach- ment to 14 muscles, as follows: rTo the tubercle (4) (8)' .To the internal surface, (4) f Rectus femoris. J Vastus externus. | Crureus. (.Vastus intemus. f Sartorius. J Gracilis. Semitendinosus. (. Semimembranosus. ( Tibialis anticus. 'To the external surface, (2) -< Extensor longus dig- ( itorum. .To the SHAFT, (6) i . T o the posterior surface, (4) - rPopliteus. Tibialis posticus. Soleus. Flexor longus digi- torum. Total, 14 Of these fourteen muscles, the first four are indirectly attached to the tibia by means of the ligamentum patellae, and only five of the fourteen muscles arise from the bone, the rest making it their point of insertion. The tibia has the largest nutrient foramen of any bone in the body. Articulations of Tibia. The tibia articulates with three bones, viz., the femur, the fibula, and the astragalus. It enters into the formation of two joints, viz., the knee and ankle joints. Development. The tibia develops by three centres of ossification, viz., one for the shaft, and one for each extremity. That for the shaft appears about the 5th week of foetal life, that for the upper extremity about the time of birth, and that for the lower extremity at about the second year. FIBULA. The fibula is a long and slender bone, prismoidal in shape and divisible into a shaft and two extremities. Upper Extremity. This portion of the bone is termed its head. It is thick and large, and marked by a concave surface which articulates with the external tuberosity of the tibia. At its external portion, is perceived a thick and rough prominence, to which is attached the external lateral ligaments of the knee-joint, and, behind, a pro- cess, called the styloid process, exists for the insertion of the tendon of the biceps muscle.

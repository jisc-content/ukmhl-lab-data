186 ARTHROLOGY OR SYNDESMOLOGY. Points of Surgical Interest. The three rows of projections, known as “ the knuckles ” are formed by the proximal bones of the respective joints and may serve as guides to amputation, if the fact that the joints lie in front of the line of the knuckles be remembered. The tendons of the fingers are more closely bound to the phalanges between the joints, than over them, and incisions made to relieve suppuration in the region of these tendons should therefore be made in the region of the shaft of the phalanges rather than near to their articular extremities. The furrows which cross the fingers on their palmar surface are three in number. The set, nearest to the palm, do not cor- respond to the joints between the bones underneath, but the second and third sets of furrows are guides to the articulations between the phalanges. In opening the joint between the trapezium and the metacar- pal bone of the thumb, the knife should be introduced between the ist and 2d metacarpal bones at their angle, with the edge directed outwards. G. ARTICULATIONS OF TIIE LOWER EXTREMITY. The articulations of the lower extremity comprise the follow- ing groups: I. The hip joint. II. The knee joint. III. The articulations between the tibia and fibula. IV. The ankle joint. V. The articulations of the tarsus. VI. The tarso-metatarsal articulations. VII. The metatarso-phalangeal articulations. VIII. The articulations of the phalanges. The Coxo-femoral or Hip Joint. This articulation is the typical enarthrodial joint of the body. It is formed by the reception of the globular head of the femur into the acetabulum or cotyloid cavity of the os innominatum. The ligaments of this joint are five in number, and may be divided into two sets, namely: 1st, the circumferential set, and 2nd, the connecting. The former of these includes two and the latter the remaining three of the five ligaments of the hip, as is shown below.

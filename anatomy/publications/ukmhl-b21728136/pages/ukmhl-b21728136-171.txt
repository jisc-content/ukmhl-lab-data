THE FEMUR. I49 BONES OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY. The skeleton of the lower extremity, as before stated, com- prises thirty bones. Each lower extremity is composed of three segments, viz. : The thigh is constituted by one bone, viz., the femur. The leg is composed of three bones, viz., the patella, the tibia, and the fibula. The foot has three segments and twenty-six bones, viz., I. tar- sus, seven bones ; 2. metatarsus, five bones; 3. digits, fourteen bones, (phalanges.) The femur is a long bone, divisible, like other bones in the same class, into a shaft, a superior and an inferior extremity. Upper Extremity. This portion of the bone presents for examination. 1. a head, 2. a neck, 3. a great trochanter, 4. a lesser trochanter. The head forms nearly two-fifths of the sphere and presents a small depression for the attachment of the ligamentum teres. The neck is situated between the head and the trochanter and is longest and most inclined in youth, growing shorter and more horizontal as age advances. It is a quad- rangular process of bone, directed inwards, upwards, and a little forwards. It is flattened, from before backwards, so that it is much greater in the vertical than in the antero-posterior direction. In adult life it forms an angle of I20°-I25° with the shaft. The greater trochanter is large, quadrilateral in shape, and is most prominent posteriorly. To its outer surface is attached the gluteus medius muscle. Its inner sur- face presents the so-called digital fossa for the inser- tion of the obturator externus muscle. Its upper bor- der affords attachment for the obturator internus, the two gemelli and the pyriformis muscles. Its anterior border affords attachment for the gluteus minimus 1. Thigh. 2. Leg. FEMUR.

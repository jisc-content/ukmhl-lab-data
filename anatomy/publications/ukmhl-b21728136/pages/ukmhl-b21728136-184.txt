BONES OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY. 162 divided by two to indicate the actual number of joints, to which the shock is carried, since the total number of articulations of each bone has been enumerated and thus the actual number of joints has been doubled. Points of Surgical Interest. The following bony points, upon the inner side of the foot, are of surgical value, since they afford guides to the various amputa- tions in this region. 1. The tuberosity of the os calcis, at the extremity of the heel. 2. The inner malleolus, in front of the heel and oppo- site the ankle joint. 3. The anterior projection of the os calcis, one inch be- low the malleolus. 4. The tubercle of the scaphoid bone, one inch in front of the malleolus. 5. The internal cuneiform bone, in front of the tubercle of the scaphoid. 6. The projection of the first metatarsal bone, at the base of the great toe. 7. The extremities of the phalanges of the great toe. Upon the outer side of the foot, the following bony points are perceived, from behind forwards, which possess a surgical im- portance. 1. The external tubercle of the os calcis. 2. The external malleolus, which descends lower and does not extend as far forwards as the inner. 3. The peroneal tubercle of the os calcis, which lies one inch below the malleolus. 4. The projection of the base of the 5 th metatarsal bone. PHALANGES. There are two phalanges in the great toe, and three in the other toes, as in the hand. They are long bones, divisible into a central portion of the shaft and two extremities. The phalanges of the first row are convex, above, concave, upon the under surface, and compressed, from side to side. The posterior extremity has a single concave articular surface, for the head of the metatarsal bone ; and the anterior extremity, a pul- ley-like surface, for the second phalanx. The second phalanges are short and diminutive, but somewhat broader than the first row.

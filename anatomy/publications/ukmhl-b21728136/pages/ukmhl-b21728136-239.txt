MUSCLES OF THE NECK. 21/ The sterno-mcistoid muscle is an important guide to the carotid arteries, since its internal border is nearly parallel with the com- mon carotid artery and since the muscle can be rendered very prominent, by the head being turned towards the opposite shoulder. Between the sternal and clavicular points of origin of this muscle, may be perceived, in all necks that are not particu- larly fleshy, a fossa called the fonticulus gutturis, since it rises and falls during respiration, especially if labored breathing exists. INFRA OR STERNO-HYOID GROUP. (4 muscles). Sterno-Hyoid. Origin. From the inner extremity of the clavicle, the pos- terior surface of the first bone of the sternum, the car- tilage of the 1st rib and the sternal end of the clavicle. Insertion. Into the lower border of the body of the hyoid bone Nervous supply. A branch from the loop between the descendens noni nerve and the communicans noni nerve. Sterno-Thyroid. Origin. From the posterior surface of the sternum and the cartilage of the 1st rib. Insertion. Into the oblique line on the ala of the thyroid car- tilage. Nervous supply. A branch from the loop between the descendens noni nerve and the communicans noni nerve. Thyro-Hyoid. Origin. From the oblique line on the ala of the thryoid car- tilage. Insertion. Into the lower border of the body of the hyoid bone and its greater cornu. Nervous supply. A branch of the hypoglossal or 12th cranial nerve. Omo-Hyoid. Origin. From the upper border of the scapula, near the supra

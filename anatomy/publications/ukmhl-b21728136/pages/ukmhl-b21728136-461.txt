439 GENERAL INTRODUCTION. The sensory nerves of the cerebro-spinal axis are found to ter- minate in one of four ways, as follows : In plexuses. In end-bulbs. In tactile corpuscles. In Pacinian bodies. The motor nerves terminate in small expansions within the muscles termed motorial end-plates. The nerves of the sympathetic system, on the other hand, are dis- tinguished from cerebro-spinal nerves by their reddish grey color, their smaller size, and their softer consistence. Cerebro-spinal nerves are divided into two great classes, on a basis of their function, called respectively the motor and the sen- sory nerves. To the latter class, collections of grey nerve matter, called ganglia, are often attached. Membranes. The coverings of the brain and the spinal cord are three in number and are called, 1st. The dura mater. 2nd. The pia mater. 3rd. The arachnoid. The dura mater is a thick, dense, fibrous membrane, which is lined, internally, by the parietal layer of the arachnoid. It serves, in the cranium, the following purposes : 1. It acts as a periosteal covering to the interior of the skull. 2. It protects the brain from possible injury, especially in early life, when the bones of the cranium are separate and imperfectly formed. 3. It supports the principal divisions of the encephalon by forming septa, which are lodged between its different portions. 4. It assists in forming venous sinuses. 5. It furnishes sheaths of protection for nerves. The dura mater of the brain differs from that of the spinal cord, in not performing the first, third, and fourth of the above- mentioned functions. These reflections or septa formed by the dura mater of the brain are called, 1. The falx cerebri. 2. The falx cerebelli. 3. The tentorium cerebelli.

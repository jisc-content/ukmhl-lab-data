THE CERVICAL NERVES. 4 77 comprise three nerves which supply the integument, and which pass upwards towards the head ; and one nerve with its branches which descends upon the clavicle. The deep branches are also divided into two sets, four being called internal branches, since they pass towards the median line of the body, and two being called ex- ternal branches, since they pass away from the median line. Of these ten nerve trunks given off from this cervical plexus, the PHRENIC NERVE is the most important. This nerve arises by three heads, derived from the 3rd, 4th and 5th cervical nerves, and descends along the inner aspect of the chest, being situated in the middle mediastinum, and is principally distributed to the diaphragm. It was named by Sir Charles Bell, and s still often called the internal respiratory nerve, since it passes internal to the chest wall. This nerve bears important relations to the subcla- vian artery, in the first and second portions of that vessel, and therefore possesses great surgical importance. Below the dia- phragm, the phrenic nerves assist to form some of the plexuses of the sympathetic. The comunicans noni nerve also possesses surgical importance since it joins with the descendens noni nerve and ramifies on the front part of the sheath of the common carotid artery. The rest of the branches of the cervical plexus are distributed either to muscles or the integument, or act as branches of com- munication to other nerves. The cervical plexus of nerves lies beneath the sterno-mastoid muscle, and in front of the levator anguli scapulae and the scalenus medius muscles.

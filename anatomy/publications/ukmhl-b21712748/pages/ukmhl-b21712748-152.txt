Seel. II. BRANCHES FROM THE the ileum, the margin-of the aceta- bulum, and the Idler gluteus ; inof- culating with the abdominal, with the fuperior ramulus of the deep branch, and at the upper extremity of the fartorius with branches of the external circumjlex. I. The ischiadic—fmaller than the former ar- tery, but obferving the fame courfe with the hypogcijlric. It paffes from the pelvis, be- tween the lower edge of the pyriformis and tjie levator ani, and defeends, under the great gluteus, parallel with the larger ifchiadic li- gament. I have obferved the trunk divided into two, fending off the middle hcemorrhoidal and pudic.—Within the pelvis, it gives a. Many, but irregular, branches to the re£tum, uterus, bladder, and obturator internus. b. Branches to the pyramidalis, inofculating, at the pafTage of the trunk, outwards with the pudic branches. Without the pelvis, c- The Coccygeal—concealed by that portion of the great gluteus which is attached to the facrum, coccyx, and the large facro-fciatic ligament, and running under this ligament to the coccyx. It is fingularly ramified, and gives origin to u. Branches, perforating the fibres of the ligament and great gluteus, running to the coccygeus and fat around the levator. R. A Deep Branch—diilributed to the coccygeus, the bone, and the levator ani; inofculating with the pudic. y. Many Anajiomotic Branches—forming inofcula- tions

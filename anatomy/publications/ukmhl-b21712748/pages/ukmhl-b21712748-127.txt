DESCENDING AORTA. 9J Sed. II. from the edge of the inteftine, into two diver- ging branches, viz. -j- The Right Anajiomotic Branch—bend- ing to the right fide of the tranfverle colon, and forming an arch with the afcending anaftomotic branch of the right colic. From the convexity df this arch, as from that of all the other arches formed on the concave fide of the large inteftines, many parallel branches rife, about two inches In length, which, as they approach the in- teftine, divide into twigs, entering the concave arch of the tube, and cir- cling round on the oppofite fides, till they meet and inofculate at its convexi- ty. Thefe minute twigs inofculate freely with the fmall epip/oics of the coeliac artery, and are ramified fimilar- ly, both on the large and fmall intef- tines, although on the former they be lefs numerous. ■j- + The Left Anajiomotic Branch—accom- panying the left part of the tranfverfe colon with a fimilar and parallel arch, and at laft inofculating, freely and ele- gantly, with the large anaftomotic branch of the left colic, proceeding from the inferior mefenteric. Thus is formed the great mefenteric arch. In- teftinal branches, rifing from the arch, are fimilar to the former. h. The Superior Right Colic—fometimes rifir.g, by a feparate trunk, from the mefenteric ; proceeds tranfverfely and to the right, in the duplicaturc of the mefocolon, to the hepatic flexure of the colon;

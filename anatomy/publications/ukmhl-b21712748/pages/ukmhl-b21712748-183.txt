DESCENDING AORTA. 347 Seel. IL A. The superior externo-articular—afeend- ing, on the periofteum of the femur, from the outer fide of the trunk, above the condyle, and running, on the periofteum, towards the origin of the fliort head of the biceps; then bending, under the common tendon of the bi- ceps, to the pofterior margin of the vaftus in- terims, divides into two ramuli. a. Many Branches of fmaller fize, running up- wards and downwards, diftributed to the peri- ofteum, capfule, biceps, and gaftrocnemii. b. The Deep Branch—pafting through the vaftus mufde, which it fupplies with ramuli, to the peri- ofteum of the external condyle, and there fpread- ing into various ramifications. Of thefe, forne are diftributed to the lateral ligament and flein; Tome are interwoven with the inferior externo- articular, and the perforating branches of the fupcrjicial femoral; while others run tranfverfe- ly to the internal condyle, and inofculate with the fuperior inte mo-articular. c. TheSuperjiciallirznch.—winding on the furface of the vaftus externus, near its extremity, towards the upper edge of the patella, and anaftomo- fing by an afeending branch with the extremity of the large defeending branch of the circum- flex, and, under the tendon of the redlus, with a branch of the large anajlomotic ; winding al- fo round the patella, and uniting, by various de- feending twigs, with the vafcular plexus of the knee, formed by all the articulars together. B. The superior interno-articular—run- ning, above the inner condyle, from the intc- K 2 rior

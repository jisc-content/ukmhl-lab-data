T O Dr BARCLAY. Dear Sir, Nothing but the defire of com- plying with your requeft, and the confidence I had, as a Pupil, in your affiftance in every difficulty, could have induced me tQ attempt the following Translation. From the high approbation I have heard you fo often exprefs of the original in your Public Lectures on Anatomy, I am happy to think that, at a time when Literary Productions are lefs eafily procured from the Continent, I have it in my power, by the Translation I now prefent to you, to render thefe Tables of the Arteries more generally known. I am, Dear Sir, With fincere efteem. Your affectionate Pupil and Friend, Edinburgh, 1 Dec. 1800. J ARCH0 SCOTT.

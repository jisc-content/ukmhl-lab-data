BRANCHES FROM THE Sect. I. coronary arteries of the upper lip $ and fome- times gives rife to mafieteric branches. 5. The Middle or Deep Temporal Branch—fent off below the zygoma This branch palfes over the zygomatic arch, and is immediately covered by the aponeurofis of the mufcle, where it ex- tends to the anterior part of the temporal muf- cle, to the external angle of the orbit, and in- ofculates with the palpebral artery. 6. The Anterior Auricular Arteries—riling above the origin of the middle temporal. Some of thefe perforate the meatus auditorius, and form a retiform plexus with the pofterior auricular artery ; others go to the helix and antihelix, the anterior auricular mufcle, and meatus audito- rius. 7. The Orbicular Branch—riling often from the temporo- frontal artery, palling above the zygo- matic arch, fends a fmall branch, in a tortuous dire&ion, to the external canthus of the eye, which, running under the orbicularis, reaches the internal angle of the orbit. In this courfe, it inofculates with the palpebral and frontal branches, and, with the frontal, forms the fuper- ciliary arch. 8. The Tempera-frontal, or Internal Anterior Branch—diltributed extenfively towards the forehead, and fometimes reaching as far as the glabella. It fends branches, which rife almoft at right angles from the trunk, to the orbi- cular, corrugator, frontal mufcles, and aponeu- rofis 9. The Temporo-occipitaly or External Pojlerior Branch—bending towards the ear, backwards and

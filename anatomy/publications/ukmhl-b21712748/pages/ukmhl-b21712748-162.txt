BRANCHES FROM THE Sett. II. small external iliac—generally fmaller than the laft, and fent off a little lower from the external fide of the trunk • paffes, up- wards and outwards, in a retrograde courfe, under the peritoneum ; reaches the crefl of the ileum ; and bending, parallel to the arch- ed circumference of this bone, to the highefl part of the crefl, proceeds between the extre- mity of the iliacus internus and tranfverfalis, as alfo betwixt the tranfverfalis and obliquus internus, where it is finally expended among the abdominal mufcles. From this arife, a. A branch, ramified on the iliacus internus, farto- rius, fat, and inguinal glands. b. A branch to the fpermatic cord ; often wanting. c. Branches, running, from various places, to the pfoas, crural nerve, and ijiacus internus ; inof- culating frequently with the tranfverfe branch of the ileo-lumbar. d. Four branches, or fometimes more, of which the exterior are the largeft, running to the tranfver- falis and obliquus internus; and, after penetra- ting this mufcle, palling, under the obliquus ex- tern us, with many branches, to the anterior part of the abdomen, inofculating with branches of the intercojlal, lumbar, and mammary arteries. e. A branch, forming, on the middle of the crefl:, a double anaftomofis with the ileo-lumbar. f. An Ultimate Branch—exhaufting the artery winding anteriorly between the obliquus and tranfverfalis. As it here fubdivides into branch- es, rifing as high as the ribs, it difappears on the Ikin, and forms a plexus with the adjoining velfels.

I4l DESCENDING AORTA. Seel. II. 7. A c. A Large Branch—often double—entering, like the trunk, the long adduftor, but higher; ter- minating in the fubftance of the addudtor, os, as fometimes happens, fending an artery through the belly of the mufcle to the flexors. d. An Afcending Branch—inofculating, near the trochanter, upon the back part of tire bone, with thtfirfl perforant. e. A Superior Tranfverfe Branch—running, either tranfverfely or obliquely, a little below the ten- don of the great gluteus, between this mufcle and the femur, tq the fubftance of the vaftus externus, and anaftomofing with the tranfverfe branches of the large defeending branch of the external circumflex. Before the trunk finks in the vaftus, a branch fometimes rifes fuddeniy from this one, beyond the great adductor, dis- tributed to the external flexors, and known by the name of the third perforant. f. An Inferior Tranfverfe Branch—running in the fame direction as the laft ; and, about two or three inches below the tendon of the great glu- teus, palfes, under the ftiort head of the biceps to the vaftus externus. If the artery proceeds farther, it gives rife, like the laft, to a fourth perforant. It gives «. Many Branches, winding on the adduftor. £. The Large Nutritious Branch of the Femur— running down, near the ftiort head of the biceps, to the outer fide of the linea afpera; inofculating with a fmall inferior nutritious branch from the inferior perforant of the fuperfeial femoral, and penetrating the bone with a larger external branch. This artery is irregular both in origin and direftion.

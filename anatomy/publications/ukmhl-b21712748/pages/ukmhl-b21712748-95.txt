SeB. I. 63 ARCH OF THE AORTA. x. Reflex branches to the fupinator brevis and the origin of the common extenfor. P. Branches ramified on the radial and ulnar exten- fors of the carpus y. Branches to the extenfors of the thumb, the com- mon extenfor, and abduftor. S. Many branches -uniting with the inferior pcrfo• rants. f A large branch to the profundus, winding ex- tenfively downwards on this mufcle. g. The Nutritions Artery of the Radius. h. Many brandies—going, in the defeent of the trunk, to the profundus and the flexor of the thumb. i. Small luteroffeal Perfcrnnts—from four to fe- .ven in number; rifing feparately from the trunk; perforating, in different places, the interoflecus ligament; and palling into the common exten- for, fupinator brevis, ulnar extenfor of the car- pus, the extenfors of the thumb, fore finger, little finger, and periofleum, they all enter into va- rious inofculations with one another ; and the fuperior are larger than the inferior. k. The Poflerior Dorflo-Inter offleal—the larger branch of the divided artery; rifing at the inferior margin of the pronator quadratus; and, ha- ving palled over the interofleous fpace, branch- ing out at the poflerior extremity of the ulna and wrift, divides into three branches and gives «. A branch to the pronator quadratus in its paf- fage. A Branches to the tendons of the radial exten- fors and periofleum; inofculating with inferior branches of the radial aitery. A

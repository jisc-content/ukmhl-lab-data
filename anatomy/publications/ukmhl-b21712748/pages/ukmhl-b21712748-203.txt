Sett. II. DESCENDING AORTA* l6$ with the deep branch of the internal plantar upon the furface of the calcaneum on the in- ternal fide of the fame bone. e. The Second Deep Branch, or Second Profunda— rifing at the termination of the os cuboides; and, while it obferves the fame courfe outwards as the laft, forming fimilar and new inofcula- tions with the anterior fibular and tranfverjc tarfal. It alfo contributes to the plexus that is fpread out in the cavity of the foot, and among the ligaments of the tarfal bones. f. Branches—fent to the abdu&or of the little toe, and the periofteum of the adjoining bones ; fpreading varioiifly among the bones, and inof- culating with the neighbouring ramuli. g. The Plant a-digital^ or External Plantar of the Little Toe—ifiuing from the trunk as it touches the bafe of the fifth metatarfal bone, and begins the formation of the arch. While it accompa- nies this bone forwards, covered by the flexor and addu&of of the little toe, it diftributes branches to thefe mufcles and fkin. At the other extremity of this fifth metatarfal bone, it receives a tranfverfe twig from the external plantary or the adjoining digitaly then paffes over the inferior or plantar furface of the bone, and, on the outer or fibular fide, reaches the apex of the little toe. h. The Second Planta-digitaly—rifing in the fourth interftice of the metatarfal bones, above the in- terofiei, at the bafis of the toes, and, while there* covered by the tranfverfe mufcle, dividing into the digito-tibial, or internal plantar, of the little toe, and the digito-fibulary or external plantar of the fourth toe.—Sending out, La *.

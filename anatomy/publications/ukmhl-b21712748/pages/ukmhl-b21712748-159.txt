Having palled obliquely over the inner edge of the pfo- as, and, running behind the peritoneum, upon thisr mufcle and- the tendinous portion of the iliacus, it paffes to the thigh under the Fallopian ligament, along with the iliac vein, which co- vers it before, and the crural nerve, which is at- tached to its external fide. For greater accura- cy of defcription, we define its extent by the in- ferior and external margin of the ligament, de- nominating the continuation of the trunk the common femoral. The branches of this ar- tery within the abdomen are, A. Many minute branches—varioufly dis- tributed to the pfoas, iliacus, lymphatic glands, vefTels, peritoneum, and the fat. Thefe, however, are fometimes wanting. B.

It firft runs downwards; then, being immediately reflected, proceeds inwards, be- hind the internal and pofterior furface of the fpermatic cord and epigaflric vein.

Ha- ving paffed through this canal, it takes the name of Popliteal Artery, where it runs from the in- ner to the back part of the thigh. Before reach- ing the pofterior part, it paffes over two-thirds of the femur; and though the thigh be here more {lender than at the fuperior part, it lies deeper concealed among the mufcles. A. Numerous branches—irregular in diftance, order, and fituation—rifing from the trunk as it runs along the anterior and inner part of the thigh, and diftributed to the inguinal glands and fartorius, and through this to the {kin ; alfo to the redus, vaftus internus, long and {hort addudors, and gracilis. Of thefe, fome are larger, fome lefs—entering the mufcles, in different places, from three to fix. B. The LARGE ANASTOMOTIC BRANCH rifing from the inner furface of the trunk, at the fu- perior margin of the tendinous canal; and, bending downwards, fpreads, with many fer- pentine ramifications, on the vaftus internus, into which it finks. From this proceed, a. A Branch to the fartorius and fkin. b. A Branch—running to the outer margin of the tendon of the fartorius before the trunk reaches the vaftus internus; and pafling, along with the tendon, over the joint of the knee, difappears on the fafcia and fkin of the leg. It firft, however, gives many branches to the knee, inofculating with the inferior articular:, and with the recurrent branch

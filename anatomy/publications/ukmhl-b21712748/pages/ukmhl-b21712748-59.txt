Seel. L ARCH OF THE AORTA. V a. A recurrent branch to the receptacle and the dura mater, giving twigs to the fifth pair of nerves. b. Branches to the periofteum of the orbit. c. A branch to the levator palpebrae and the op- tic nerve. d. A branch to the abdu&or mufcle. e. A branch perforating the zygoma, and inofcula- ting with the internal deep temporal artery. f. Many branches, expended on the lachrymal gland. g. The Inferior External Tarfeal Branch—term- ing the tarfeal arch at the margin of the lower eye lid, with the inferior palpebral branch. h. The Superior External Tarfeal Branch—form- ing a fimilar arch with the fuperior palpebral branch. 2. The Long Ciliary Branch—A description of the Ciliary arteries will be given below. 3. The Supraorbital, or Superior Mufcular Branch —rifes, while the trunk erodes the nerve, un- der the periolteurrr of the orbit; then bending to the levator palpebrae, proceeds forwards, and, after palling through the fupraorbitary hole, is diftributed, upon the forehead, in two Separate branches. a. Branches going to the fuperior oblique, the leva- tor palpebrse, the fuperior redfi mufcles, the fclerotic coat, and the periofteum. b. An Inferior Branch—widely diftributed on the periofteum of the os fronds, and inofculating with the temporal and frontal branches. c. An External Branch—covered by the orbicular mufcle', to which it gives twigs, as alfo to the corrugator. It forms many anaftomofes with the neighbouring branches. 4. The Central Artery of the Retina—rifing from the

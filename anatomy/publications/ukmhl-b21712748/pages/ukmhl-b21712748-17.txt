' XI I forbear mentioning thofe authors who have de- fcribed the arteries, fince to thofe who have been ini- tiated into anatomical ftudies the moft of them are known or recommended. The great defect of thefe illuftrious writers is, that almoft all of them have ca- pricioufly changed the ancient denominations of the ramifications, and impofed new ones of their own.

He, as it / were, having made this branch of anatomy his own, explained their diftributions more accurately and ele- gantly than had hitherto been done: nor was this all; hut whenever he faw it neceflary to fubftitute new or more apt denominations, he ftill took notice of the pld ones in their proper place. Few, it is to be re- gretted, make fufficient ufe of this rich treafure of anatomical knowledge, and examine properly thofe excellent drawings in the work, which are Nature it- felf. Among thofe, however, who deferve praife for their inquiries into this fubjeCt, I cannot forbear men- tioning with approbation Sabbatier and Meyer.

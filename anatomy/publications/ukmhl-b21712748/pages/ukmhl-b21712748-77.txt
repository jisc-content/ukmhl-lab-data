ARCH OF THE AORTA. 45 winding dire&ion upon the anterior furface of the medulla, inofculating by tranfverfe branches in the region of the neck and back with the artery of the oppofite fide, to which it is parallel. The two arteries at laft uniting near the termination of the medulla, form a trunk, which is fent to the extremity of the os facrum ; and which, if emp- tied of its blood, afiumes the appearance of a nerve: whence the ancient error as to a Ner- vus Azygos. It diltributes numerous branches to the neighbouring parts, and to the nerves as they go out, and enters into frequent anafto- mofes with the fpinal branches, penetrating the interftices of the vertebrae. The basilar artery, being formed as above, occupies the depreffion in the middle of the tu- ber annulare, and at its anterior part divides into four parallel branches, proceeding from the trunk at right angles. Of thefe, the po- fterior go to the cerebellum; and the two an- terior, ramified on the cerebrum, unite with the communicating arteries of the carotid, and form the Great Circle of Willis. From the trunk a. Many branches proceed, tranfverfely and out- wards, diftributed to the furface of the medulla oblongata, the corpora olivaria and pyramidalia, the tuber annulare, the inferior furface of the cerebellum, and the neighbouring pairs of nerves. Of thefe, a branch, accompanying the auditory nerve, pafies to the labyrinth of the ear. b. The Deep Arteries of the Cerebellum—Right and Left—winding behind the crura of the cerebrum to

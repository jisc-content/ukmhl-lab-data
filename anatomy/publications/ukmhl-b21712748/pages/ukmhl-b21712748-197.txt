Se5l.IL DESCENDING AORTA. 159 B. The LARGE NUTRITIOUS ARTERY of the TIEIA, or posterior interosseal—fpreading exten- flvely downwards, between the flexor of the toes and pojlerior tibial, above the interofleous ligament, and inofculating with the Jibular at the inferior extremity of the tibia. From this ifllie, a. A Branch to the foleus, popliteus, and periofteum of the tibia, communicating with the defending branch of the inferior interno-articular. b. A Branch to the tibialis pofticus. c. A Nutritious Branch—entering the bone, and diftributing its twigs upwards and downwards. d. Branches—winding, through the whole courfe of the artery, partly on the periofteum of the tibia, and partly on the tibial mufcle and the common flexor. C. A large branch—winding round the exter- nal head of the fibula, under the mufcles, af- ter giving a twig to the foleus, and receiving fome anaftomotic branches of the tibial recur- rent. D. Many large branches to the foleus, inter- woven everywhere with Jibular twigs. E. Some cutaneous branches—running out far with the veins and nerves, and anaftomofing, upwards and downwards, with the anterior ti- bial. F. The common fibular, or peroneal—very ir- regular in fixe and the diftribution of its branch- es. It often equals in dimenfion the anterior tibial; at fome times is entirely wanting -} and at

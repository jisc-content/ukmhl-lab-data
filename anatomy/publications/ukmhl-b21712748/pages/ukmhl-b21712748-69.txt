The Mufculo-phrenic—riling in a large branch at the fixth interftice of the ribs, turns out- wards, between the cartilages and the fterno- coftal; then proceeds obliquely to the inter- faces of the feventh, eighth, and ninth ribs, where it forms inofculating rings with the infe- rior intercoftal arteries ; and here fending many twigs to the diaphragm, at laft fpreads at the tenth rib on the tranfverfe mufcle of the abdo- men. m. A branch, winding on the furface of the enfi- form cartilage, and inofculating with the branch- es of the oppofite fide, or going down as far as the re£tus rpufcle.

An Internal Branch—going down to the rec- tus mufcle, often as far as the umbilicus, and in- ofculating with twigs of the epigajlric. An External Branch—going to the tranfverfalis, and inofculating with the epigaftric, intercoftal, and lumbar arteries; fometimes fent from the mufculo-phrenic ; and if that be fmaller, this fup- plies it with many branches.

Sett.L ARCH OF THE AORTA. 35 of the fubclavian arteries, and their ramuli, pre- sent fo many varieties, that no defcription, either as to their number or their direflion, can in every refpedl correfpond with Nature. In gene- ral, however, the four firft branches arife before the artery finks under the fcalenus, while the red are fent off beyond the margin of this muf- cle. Thefe are, A. The INTERNAL MAMMARY ARTERY—-going off from the lower and anterior part of the trunk, at the higheft part of the pleura, where, afcending gradually, and again bending downwards to the fternum, it reaches the margin of the firft rib, under which it paf- fes; and, running between the pleura and middle part of the cartilages of the ribs, de- fcends between the internal intercoftal and the fterno cofial muffles, as far as the dia- phragm. It then paffes between the dia- phragm and the libs, and, dividing into ma- ny twigs, is loft under the retftus of the ab- domen. From its origin to the third rib, it bends towards the fternum, then gradually inclines outwards. Its branches are, a. A Recurrent Branch—palling in the dire£tion of the clavicle to the mufcles of the neck, and diftributing to thefe mufcles fmall irregular ramuli. b. The Thymic Branch—which is often double, and varies very much in the diflribdtion of its twigs C 2 to

ScCl, II. DESCENDING AORTA. I37 margin of the thyroid hole, with the external and internal branch of the obturator. The reft of the artery, after diftributing, in this courfe, various branches to the addu£fors, gra- cilis, and genital integuments, inofculates with the external pudics. e. The Inferior Branch, or Inferior Vofierior Cir- cumflex— exhibiting a continuation of the trunk — runs, over the Idler trochanter, to the neck of the femur; diftributing, in its courfe, fmall branches to the capfule of the joint, the aceta- bulum, obturator, and great addu£tor. Be- tween the quadr .tus and great addudor, it di- vides into, 1. The External, or Superior External Branch — often called the Poflerior Trochanteric.—This fmaller iamulu3, concealed by the quadratus, runs obliquely, outwards and upwards, to the pofterior part of the bone, and, as it approaches the trochanter, divides into two branches; the larger afeending obliquely upwards to the tro- chanteric fofla, and the fmaller defeending in a different courfe. Thus are produced, «. Branches to the great adduftor and obtu- rator externus; inofculating frequently with the external branch of the obturator, fi. Branches to the capfule, bone, and quadra- tus, A branch, inofculating, near the origin of this fmaller trunk, with the concomitant if- chiaJic, which fends a twig between the quadratus and the great adduftor. t. Branches, inofculating, at the root of the trochanter major, on both fides of the apo- neurofis, witkthe tranfverfe branches of the external circumflex. From

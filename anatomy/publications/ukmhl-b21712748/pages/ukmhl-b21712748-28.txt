2 THE AORTA. white line, which is called Tendo drteriofus, and which defines the extent of the mufcle, Some tranfverfe fibres of the heart are united to the aorta from without, and cover it for a line and an half, though a little more loofely at the ex- tremity. The aorta having left the heart, is im- mediately expanded ; nof does it again recover its firft diameter till it reaches the place where it fends off the fubclavian artery of the right fide. In its afcent, it is firft inflecled to the right, be- hind and beyond the pulmonary artery; it then gradually inclines itfelf to the left, till, having formed a tranfverfe arch, it is feen projecting behind the lungs, at the left fide of the vertebrae. From thefe it receives its chief fupport, and de- fcends along with them in the fame ftraight line ; till at laft, having entered the abdomen, it again begins to turn towards the right, or refts upon the middle of the vertebras. â€¢ By the arch of the aorta, is underftood that part of it which is bent nearly in the form of a parabola, and which maintains the curved di- rection already mentioned, though its right pil- lar at firft ftretches to the right, and then pro- ceeds to the left, while the left advances almoft in a ftraight line. I exclude the ancient and now obfolete diftin&ion of the Aorta into the Afcer.d- ing, Tranfverfe, and Defcending. When

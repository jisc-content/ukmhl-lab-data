21 ARCH OF THE AORTA. hole of the large wing of the fphenoid bone, going to the os raalae and the lachrymal gland. , The meningeal artery fometlmes fends off the la- chrymal artery within the cranium. 5. The Inferior Maxillary Artery—going down, in company with the nerve of the fame name, to the inframaxillary canal. As it enters the ca- nal along with the nerve, it fends branches to the internal pterygoid and the mylohyoide- us ; and is fo diftributed on the canal of the bone, that fome pofterior branches go to the dentes molares and the bone itfelf, while an- terior twigs enter the alveolar procefs of the incifores : Then palling through the inframaxil- lary hole, it inofculates with the labial branches, and is diftributed to the adjacent mufcles and lip. 6. Pterygoid Branches—varying in number—and diftributed, both fuperficially and more deeply, on the pterygoid and buccinator mufcles. 7. The Deep External Temporal Artery—before the trunk is concealed by the zygoma, gives a branch, which, in its afcent, refts upon the ten- don of the temporal mufcle, and terminates in this mufcle and adjoining parts ; while another, which fome call the maffeteric> is fent outwards and forwards between the procefles of the ma- xilla, to the external pterygoid and mafteter mufcles. 8. The Deep Internal Temporal Artery—riling in that part where the trunk proceeds tranfverfely near the antrum Highmorianum, terminating in the temporal mufcle, and tranfmitting a twig B 3 through

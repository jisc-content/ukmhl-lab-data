i 56 BRANCHES FROM THE Sett. II. or producing, as in the hand, dorfal branches. The anterior perforants, penetrating, near the roots of the toes, the metatarfal interftices, feem to arife from thefe dorfo-metatarfah; or, if they have iffued from the plantar metatarfals and di- gital.r, anaftomofe with them in the fame place. L. Branches—diftributed, from the inner edge of the tibial artery, to the internal fide of the tibia, the externor .endons, the periofteum, the tendon of the tir ialis anticus, and the na- viculare nd firft uneiform bone. M. A branch—r nnin on the furface of the na- viculare towards the plantar fide of the foot, where, covered by the abdudtor pollicis, to which it gives branches, it inofculates with one or two branches of the internal plantar. N. A branch to the abdu&or pollicis, firft run- ning along the margin of the firft metatarfal bone, and then difappearing on the inner fide of the dorfum of the great toe. O. A branch-—iffuing from the external edge, between the tranjverfe tarfal and tranfverfe metatarfal arteries, giving twigs to the exten- for tendons and the fhort common extenfor. P. The transverse metatarsal artery—va- rying in fize, and fometimes entirely wanting, according to the number and magnitude of the branches which are fent off from the tranj- verfe tarfal. It runs to the commencement of the firft and fecond dorfo-metatarfal bones, and, paffing tranfverfely to the little toe, gives rife

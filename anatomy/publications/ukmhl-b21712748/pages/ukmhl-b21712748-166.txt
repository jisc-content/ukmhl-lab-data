Sett. 11. BRANCHES FROM THE ^32 often wanting; riling either feparately, or forming together a common trunk—diftribu- ted, in various places, to the iliacus internus, capfule, Ikin, fartorius, vaftus externus and internus, and the heads of the triceps \ and inofculating, on ihefe mufcles, with fmall twigs of the internal and external circumflex. At times they fend off fome external pudic branches. B. The external circumflex—a confpicuous branch, and often the firlt when it arifes from the common trunk ; though it fometimes if- fues from the fuperflcial femoral. It bends outwards, between the iliacus internus, the redtus and fartorius, and between the tenfor of the broad fafcia and the anterior furface of the middle gluteus; and, palling tranfverfely under the tendinous head of the vaftus exter- nus, difappears at lalt near the root of the large trochanter. In this courfe, its principal divilions are, a. A branch, finking in the iliacus internus, and re- turning to the cavity of the pelvis. b. Another branch, extending, under the iliacus, to the inner fide of the femur; inofculating, near the trochanter minor, with a branch of the in- ternal circumflex. c. The Large Tranfverfe Branch—conftituting the fuperior part of the trunk, where it lies under the vaftus ; and giving out, near to its origin, o. Branches to the iliacus, tenfor of the broad faf- cia, and the higher extremity of the fartorius and re&us. . Many

BRANCHES FROM THE Sift. 11. 120 FLEX, INTERNAL, MIDDLE, Or EXTERNAL PU- BIC—riling, often from a common trunk, with the ifchiadic, but is ealily diftinguilhed by its fmaller fize, by its bending more forwards and inwards while in the pelvis, by its palling out between the pyriformis and the pofterior part of the levator ani, and by its greater di- llance from that extremity of the pyriformis which is attached to the facrum. No fooner has it palfed from the cavity of the pelvis, than it is concealed by the great fa- cro-fciatic ligament, under which it runs to the fpine of the ifchium, an/1 enters the fpace between the lelfer and greater facro- fciatic ligaments. Having palfed the fpine, it next runs to the furface of the tuberolity of the ifchium which looks inwards to the pelvis; where, being attached to the bone by the aponeurofis of the obturator internqs, and following the curved margin of the ifchium, it bends forwards to its ramus. The artery is here exhaulted by two branches fent off near the tranfverfe mufcle of the perineum. Its branches form three clalfes. The firjl, comprehending thofe arteries which rife from the trunk as it defcends within the pelvis, viz. a. Small branches to the re&urn and its conglobate glands. b. Vefical Branches—to the lower part of the blad- der ; and if the branch be large, to the proftate gland,

I46 BRANCHES FROM THE St ft. II. of the poples, to the femimembranofus, and in- ofculating, on its furface, with the fuperior per- forant■ It is fometimes wanting. d. Branches—uniting, on the vaftus externus, with the larger and lejfer defending branches of the external circumflex. e. A Branch—bending to the vaftus internus, and fometimes inofculating, under the tendon of the triceps, with a leffer defcending branch. The popliteal artery—that part of the Superficial Femoral which runs along the hollow t)f the poples. As its limits fhould be accu- rately defined, on account of the numerous branches which arife from it, we obferve, that its fuperior part is bounded by the pofterior mar- gin of the tendon of the triceps, and its inferior by the higher extremity of the foleus mufcle, ■under which it divides into the Anterior and Fo- fierior Fibial Arteries. Being covered external- ly by the aponeurofis which furrounds the joint, it runs obliquely, outwards and downwards, through the adipofe fubftance between the flex- or tendons, pafling into the cavity between the condyles and the heads of the gaftrocnemii. As it proceeds over the joint of the knee, it lies up- on the capfule, and afterwards on the popliteal mufcle. The numerous branches to which, in this courfe, it gives origin, are divided into Ar- ticular and Muficular, Of thefe, the firft are, A. The

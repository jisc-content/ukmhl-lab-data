B. The Hepatic.—This artery, which in adults is ftnaller than the fplenic, but in children larger, rifes from the right fide of the cceliac, or, as fometimes happens, from the fitperior mefente- ric; when, turning upwards near the outer point of the lobule of Spigelius, it is concealed by the pancreas ; then proceeding forwards, upwards, and to the right, behind the right extremity of the Itomach and the duodenum, it obferves the fame obliquity as the lelfer arch ; and, after run- ning an inch, or an inch and an half, divides, below the neck of the gall bladder, into the right tranfverfe and left afeending hepatics ; entering, at laft, with the other hepatic velfels, the tranfverfe failure or folia of the liver. In- clofed in the capfule of Glilfon, it occupies a middle fpace between the biliary dufts and the vena porta. Before its divifion, it fends a. Many fmall pancreatic branches. b. Minute branches to the lelfer omentum and ve- na porta. c. The Duodena-Gajlric, or G afro-duodenal, or Pan- creatico-duodenal—Tiling at a right angle from the trunk, and, behind the pylorus, proceeds forwards between the commencement of the duo- denum and the head of the pancreas, and, with- out forming a connexion w jth this gland, reaches the

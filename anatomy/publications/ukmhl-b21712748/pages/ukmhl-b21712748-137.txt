Seel. II. 103 DESCENDING AORTA aorta, to the middle adipofe fubftance of the kidney. 3. The Inferior Adipofe Branch—riling from the fpcrmatic, below the lower extremity of the kid- ney ; and, bending to its pofterior and inferior adipofe fubftance, inofculates with the fuperior adipofe branches, the i/eo-cohcs, and twigs from the fpermatic. IX. The ureteric arteries—which maybe rec- koned among the fmalleft branches of the aorta, approach the ureter in different places; and may likewife be divided into, 1. Superior Ureterics—rifing from the renal artery, the inferior capfulars} and fpermatics, run to the pelvis of the kidney, and the upper part of the ureter. 2. Middle Ureterics—iffuing from the aorta, a little above its bifurcation, or from the common iliac or fpermatic, run, with minute twigs, extenfive- ly, upwards and downwards, upon the middle part of the ureter, proceeding to the peritone- um of the pelvis and the lumbar glands. 3. The Inferior Ureteric—rifing from the inferior veficals or uterine, near the infertion of the ure- ter into the bladder, inofculates, upon the blad- der, with the former branches, fending off, in every diredlion, minute ramuli through the whole of the canal. X. The lumbar arteries—Right and Left.— Five in number ; iffuing from the lateral and pollerior part of the aorta, at nearly a right angle. The firfl runs tranfverfely under the firfl vertebra of the loins. The fifth, between the

24 BRANCHES FROM THE Sc£l. 1. I have fometimes found this pharyngeal branch entirely wanting. 14. The Nafal Artery—the laft branch of the trunk, and often double, paiTing through the fphe- no-palatine hole, and dividing, at the fu- perior and polterior part of the nofe, into a. A fmall branch, going to thefpofterior ethmoid cells. b. Branches to the fphenoidal finufes. c. Larger branches to the feptum of the nofe. d. A large branch, palling through the fuperior and inferior fpongy bones to the bottom of the nofe ; giving twigs to the antrum and the mem- branes of the noftrils, and inofculating wich the anterior palatine branch as it palfes through the foramen incifivum. (II.) The Internal Carotid, or Cerebral Artery.-—This artery, as it rifes to its canal, is connected before, by means of cellular fub- ftance, to the par vagum and intercoflal nerves; and behind, to the redus anticus mufcle. Some- times it forms above the vertebrae a larger or a fmaller projeding curvature. In this courfe no branches are, in general, given off. At laft it enters the foramen caroticum; and, paffing along this canal, undergoes many remarkable inflec- tions. On its fir ft entering the foramen, where it forms an obtufe angle, the artery proceeds upwards, inwards, and a little forwards. As it begins to rife from the canal forwards and up- wards, the fecond curvature appears very ob- tufe.

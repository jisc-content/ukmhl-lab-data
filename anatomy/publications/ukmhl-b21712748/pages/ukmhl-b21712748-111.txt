IV. The left or superior bronchial—riling tranfverfely to the left bronchus, or left divi- fion of the trachea, and giving branches fi- milar to the former. V. The inferior bronchial—ifiuing from the aorta at the fifth vertebra, and accompanying the bronchi, in the courfe of the pulmonary vein, to the internal parts of the lungs; di- ftributing twigs fimilar to the former bron~ chicil. N. B. Although the bronchial arteries de- ferve our attention from their inofculations in the fubftance of the lungs with the fmali branches of the pulmonary artery ; yet, like other fmaller vefiels, they exhibit new va- rieties in almoft every fubjeft. VI. Oesop hageal arteries—five or fix in num- ber—flender—ifiuing, at different places, from the trunk, under the bronchials, or fome- times from the bronchials themfelves. They wind on the furface of the oefophagus, run- ning afterwards to the pofierior mediaftinum and the pericardium. Of thefe, the largeft enters the abdomen with the oefophagus, and generally inofculates with the coronary cefo- phageal,

Sett. II. DESCENDING AORTA. IO9 the bone under the iliac mufcle, and Imply- ing its nutritious arteries. B. The sacro lateral arteries—irregular in origin and number. Sometimes only one, fometimes more, even to five, come off from the trunk, from the poflerior iliac, or the ilea- lumbar. If only one be prefent, it goes down, near the foramina of the facrum, as far as the coccyx, and there forms the arch already- mentioned. If more, the fuperior inofculate among themfelves; while the inferior termi- nates in the facro-median. They always give a. Anterior Branches—running to the bodies of the vertebra:; inofculating with the Sacro-me- dian and other neighbouring arteries5 and ra- mifying on the adjoining mufcles and nerves. b. Spinal Branches—four or five in number, each of them entering the facral holes, and diftribu- ted to the fpinal cavity. + An Anterior Branch—forming a plexu3 in- ternally upon the membranes Iheathing the cauda equina, and inofculating with the fu- perior fpinal arteries. + + A Pofterior Branch—palling through the po- ftcrior hole of the facrum, and fupplying twigs to the ganglion of the nerve, the peri- odeum, the ligaments, the multifidus fpinar, and the longiffitnus dorfi ; inofculating with its fellows and the ifcbiadics. C. The umbilical artery—which, in the foe- tus, was the real trunk of the hypogajlric, re- flected upwards to the umbilicus, is, in the adult, converted almoft wholly into a foft fpongy

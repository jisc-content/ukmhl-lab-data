Thefe arches, by means of their twigs, not only form various inofculations among them- felves, but alfo with the arborefcent ramifica- tions of the two furfaces. The inner inteflinal coat is fo covered by thefe branches and the veins, as to give it the appearance of being whol- ly vafcular. The trunks of thefe arborefcents lie on the roots of the valvulce. The arches are polygons ; and the firft feries larger than the reft. The lymphatic glands, and coats of the veflels, are furrounded with numerous and va- rious twigs as varioufly diftributed. N. B. The more flender branches of the mefente- ric generally inofculate freely with the fperma- tic arteries, near the duodenum and commence- ment of the fmall inteftines, and with the cap- fular and adipofe branches. Singular, likewife, is that inofculation which the mefenteric forms with the epigajlric in the foe- tus. IV. The INFERIOR MESENTERIC, Or LEFT CO- LIC.â€”This artery riles, between the renal and common iliacs, from the anterior and left fide of the aorta ; defcends behind the peritone- um to the left fide of the trunk ; and ha- ving reached that place where the aorta divides into two remarkable crura forming the iliacs, fends off a large branch ; and, af- ter palling the iliac artery, finks behind the redlum into the pelvis.

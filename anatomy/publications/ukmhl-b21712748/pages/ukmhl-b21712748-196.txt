*53 BRANCHES FROM THE Sett. It times fooner, arifes the plant a-pollicar^ rernark- - able attery on the plantar fide of the great toe, of which I fhall give a defcription along with the plantar branches. [II.] The posterior tibial——the other branch of the Popliteal Artery, where it divides at the fliperior extremity of the foleus—palling down, under the foleus, upon the poderior furface of the flexor longus and tibialis poflicus, to the lower extremity of the tibia, is afterwards in- fledled inwards to the plantar fide of the foot, running between the tendo Achillis and the epi- phyhs of the tibia, behind the internal ankle. While there covered by the laciniated ligament, and involved in fat, it meets, on the inner fide of the foot, the broad extremity of the abdudlor pollicis, and divides into two branches : One of which, paffing to the great toe, I call the Inter- nal Plantar; the other, denominated External Plantar, runs to the foie, between the flexor bre- vis and longus, and under thefe, dill deeper, to the fifth metatarfal bone. Here returning to the great toe, by an oblique and tranfverfe flexion under the tendons of the flexor longus, it forms the- plantar arch. The branches iffuing from this artery I fhall enumerate in the order in which they are exhibited. A. Branches to the inner head of the gaftrocne- mius; often wanting. B.

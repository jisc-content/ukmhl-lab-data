Many branches—palling, under the tranf- verfe ligament, to the extremity of the tibia, the hollow of the tarfus, capfule, extenfor ten- dons, the moll of the tarfal bones, particularly the aftragalus and the Ihort extenfor. Some of thefe, winding on the tarfal bones, and bending with ramuli to the planta, run on one fide, near the tendons of the peronei, to the Jihular ; and, on the other, beyond the in- ner margin of the tarfus to the internal plan- tar. K. The TRANSVERSE TARSAL, OF TARSAL fent from the external fide of the trunk, outwards and downwards, under the extenfor brevis, to the furface of the fecond row of tarfal bones, uniting, at the edge of the fifth metatarfal bone, with the external plantar; and thus form- ing the tarfal arch. From this trunk general- ly proceed, a. A Branch—running outwards, between the ar- ticulation of the tibia and fibula, with the aftra- galus ; and, after fending twigs to each articula- tion, inofculating with the pojlerior f.bular and external malleolar. b. A Branch—finking deep into the fovea or pit of the tarfus, and there fupplying its ligaments and fat. (. Branches—riling, in various places, and exhauft- ed on the extenfor brevis. d. Branches

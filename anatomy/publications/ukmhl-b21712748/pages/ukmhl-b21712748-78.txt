46 BRANCHES FROM THE Sett. I. to the fuperior part of the cerebellum, and there exhibiting, + A Short Anterior Branch—diftributed to the crura cerebelli, the cerebellum, the vermiform procefs and the choroid plexus, lying on the thalami. + + A Middle Branch—winding extenfively on the upoer fide of the cerebellum ; inofculating freely with the inferior of the cerebellum ; en- tering the different fulci, and fupplying the thalami, nates, teftes, and pineal gland. -j- T T A Deeper Branch—following the fame courfe ; fpreading, with minute twigs, on the crura cerebri, the thalami, nates, pineal gland, choroid plexus, the proceffes of the cerebellum at the teftes, the valve of Vieuffenius, and the fourth ventricle. c. The Deep Artery of the Cerebrum—larger than the laft, and feparated from it by the third pair of nerves. Turns upwards along with the former, between the cerebellum and pofterior lobe of the cerebrum •, and gives, 1. Smaller branches, running to the bottom of the third ventricle, the thalami, optic nerve, the mammillary eminences, the comora quadrigemi- na, and fornix. 2. Communicating Branches—forming the circle of Willis, and frequently of unequal ffze. They proceed forwards, almoft at a right angle, to meet the communicating artery of the carotid, and give minute twigs to the adjacent parts. 3. A branch, going to the Tides of the crura of the cerebrum and the lateral ventricle, and diftribu- ting fmall branches above the thalami, to the corpora quadrigemina, the pineal gland, the cho- roid plexus covering thefe parts, to the fornix, the corpora ftriata, and the third ventricle. 4.

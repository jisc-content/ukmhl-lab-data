BRANCHES FROM THE Sf&. I. oc. A branch to the fuperior oblique and the ad- ductor. p. A branch to the pofterior cells of the ethmoid and fphenoid bones, where it inofculates with branches of the internal maxillary nafal branch. 9. The Anterior Ethmoidal Artery—rifes where the trunk, as it pafles over the fourth pair of nerves, reaches the trochlea. It then enters the anterior orbitary hole, and proceeds into the cranium through a peculiar opening near the ethmoid cells, diftributing fome ramuli, to the nofe. a. Branches to the frontal finufes, to the anterior ethmoidal and nafal finufes, inofculating freely with the nafal branches. b. Branches, diftributed to the dura mater and the falx. to. The Inferior Palpebral Artery—rifing often a- long with the fuperior palpebral, at that place where the trunk generally leaves the tendon of the fuperior oblique. a. A branch to the tarfeal ligament, angle of the eye lids, the caruncula lachrymalis, and the tu* nica adnata. £. Branches to the anterior ethmoid cells, inofcula- ting with the apterior ethmoidal, and palling with the infraorbital branch to the lachrymal fac. y. Branches running along the margin of the tar- fus, forming with the lachrymal the tarfeal ar- tery, or inferior tarfeal arch. 11. The Superior Palpebral Artery— I. Branches going to the fuperior part of the orbicular mufcle, to the ligament of the palpe- brse, and to the caruncula lachrymalis. 2. A branch, forming with the lachrymal artery, near the tarfeal cartilage, the fuperior tarfeal arch. 12. The Nafal Artery— rifing over the fuperior part of

BRANCHES FROM THE Sett. II, rior edge of the trunk, in a tranfverfe or oblique dire&ion, under the tendon of the triceps, to the patella. It is fometimes double. a. Smaller Branches—diftributed, in the hollow of the poples, to the periofteum, capfule, condyle, and flexor tendons. b. A Superficial Branch—exhibiting a continuation of the trunk—running, between the tendon of the biceps and the vaftus internus, to the furface of the knee, and there forming a vafcular plex- us by its numerous branches. It inofculates, near the lateral ligament, with an afcending branch of the inferior inter no-articular, and, by fending out branches that obliquely perforate the ligamentous ftrata, is extenfively ramified below the patella. N. B. A Deep Branch arifes from the large ana- fiomotic branch of the femoral. C. The middle articular, or azygos—irre- gular in its origin—riling fometimes from the poflerior and outer furface of the popliteal, at other times from the external or internal fupe- rior articular; runs always to the poflerior li- gaments of the knee and the middle of the capfule ; and divides into, a. An External Branch—winding extenfively be- tween the condyles \ running to the poflerior and crucial ligament, and the femilunar carti- lages, and inofculating here with all the adjoin- ing branches. b. An Internal Branch—diftributing its twigs, in the inner fide of the capfule, to the fat of the poples, to the bone, crucial ligament, and cap- fule.

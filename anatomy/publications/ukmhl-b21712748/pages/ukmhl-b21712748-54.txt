^RANCHES FROM THE Seel. 1. 22 through the cheek-bone, to fuppfy the fat and periofteum of the orbit. 9. The Buccal, or Artery of the Cheek—irregular in its origin, arifing, fometimes from the extern nal deep temporal artery, fometimes from the alveolar, and fometimes from the infraorbital —penetrates the buccinator ; and, winding on its furface, gives branches to the zygomati- cus, the levator, the glands, and the adipofe fubftance. 10. The Alveolar Artery—proceeding in y tortu- ous direction, above the alveolar proceffes and the fuperior maxillary bone, towards the cheek and face—where it gives, a. Branches to the buccinator, fat, and internal fur*; face of the cheek bone, and the gums. b. Branches entering, by minute holes, the antrum Highmorianum. c. The Superior Maxillary Artery of the Teeth — paffing through the perforation in the tuber ma- xillare; and as it runs along the canal of the bone, giving branches, with fome from the in- fraorbital, to the dentes molares, canini and in- cifivi. 11. The Infraorbital Artery—rifmg in the fpheno- maxillary fiffure, near the infraorbital groove j and, paffing along this canal, emerges at laft upon the face through the infraorbital hole. Before the trunk reaches the canal, branches are diflributed to the fat and dura mater of the orbit, 'to the lachrymal gland, and to the infe- rior oblique mufcle of the eye. From the ca- nal, •F Branches go to the orbicular mufcle, the la- chrymal fact, and the nofe. F F Branches,

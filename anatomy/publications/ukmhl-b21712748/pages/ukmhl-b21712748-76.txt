BRANCHES FROM THE 44 SeSi. L 5. The Inferior Artery of the Cerebellum.—ifiuing at a right angle from the trunk, near the me- dulla oblongata, between the tenth and ac- ceffbry nerves. It not only diftributes many branches to the lower furface of the cerebellum, but, being concealed between the medulla ob- longata and the crura of the cerebellum, is fo bent backwards and upwards, as to terminate in the vermiform procefs of the cerebellum and fourth ventricle. In this courfe are given, 1. Branches to the tenth and eleventh nerves. 2. Branches to the anterior and lateral furfaces of the medulla oblongata, and corpora olivaria. 3. Branches to the pofterior furface of the medulla oblongata, and the choroid plexus of the fourth ventricle. 6. Branches finking into the furrow that feparates the corporapyramidalia from the tuber annu- lare. 7. The Pofterior Spinal Artery—riling often from the inferior artery of the cerebellum; and, bend- ing from the anterior to the pofterior furface of the medulla oblongata, defcends tortuoufly on the fpinal marrow, and inofculates freely in its defcent with its fellow and with other branches, as they pafs to the medulla through the openings for the nerves. It terminates on the furface of the medulla at the fecond lum- bar vertebra ; and through its whole courfe fup- plies, with minute twigs, the medulla, and its feveral nerves, as they pafs out. 3. The Anterior Spinal Artery—rifing, at an acute angle from the trunk, near its fellow, and, de- fending in a retrograde courfe, proceeds in a winding

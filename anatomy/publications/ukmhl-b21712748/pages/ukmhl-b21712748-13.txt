THE TRANSLATORâ€™S PREFACE. vii Where he has ufed fometimes more, and fometimes fewer epithets, in defcribing the artery, I have regu- larly, where there was no danger of ambiguity, pre- ferred the leffer number, and have ventured to con- vert them into compounds. Thus, I have called a branch of the Humeral Profunda the Profunda Ra- dial, inflead of the Larger Communicating Radial branch of the Profunda Humeri. \ I have only to add, that in all thofe cafes where Ulnar, Radial, Tibial, and Fibular, are the lafl words of a compound, they denote lituation or direction and when the firfl, lituation or origin. Where any other changes are made, intimation is given in the Notes. My reafon for prefixing a Table of Contents in Englilli and Latin, including the names of the prin- cipal arteries, with a reference to the pages where they are defcribed, requires, I hope, no explanation. The utility of this Table will foon be perceived by the young Anatomift. THE

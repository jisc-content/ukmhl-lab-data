60 BRANCHES FROM THE S?ft. L B. The ulnar, the profunda-radial, the lejfer profunda, and all the recurrents, forms, above and below the condyle, the pojlerior dorfal arch of the hu- merus. This arch diftributes many branches to the joint and the neighbouring parts. M. Smaller branches to the internal brachial, and the mufcles arifing from the flexor con- dyle. The Ulnar Artery.â€”The humeral artery fometimes undergoes the divifion already men- tioned at the middle of the humerus, or even higher. This, however, is the larged: artery which arifes from the trunk at the bend of the arm. Scarcely has it arifen, when it links deep into the cavity that is occupied by the tendon of the biceps, the nerve, blood-veffels, and fat. It then bends, neap the interdice of the bones, un- der the pronator teres, radial flexor, palma- ris longus, and fublimis, to the ulnar fide of the fore-arm, proceeding gradually, with ma- ny defledlions, between the fublimis, the pro- fundus, and ulnar flexor, to the wrid. Palling over the wrid, it forms the Juperjicial arch of the hand, which gives beautiful arteries to the fingers, and finally inofculates at the palm with the radial artery. The more remarkable branch- es which it fends off are, A. A branch to the pronator teres and the com- mon head of the flexors.

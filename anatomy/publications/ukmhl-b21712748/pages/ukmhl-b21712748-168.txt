BRANCHES FROM THE *34 Sea. II. circle at the root of the large tro- chanter. d. The Large Defcending Branch—rifing from the trunk, where it feems continued into the great tranfverfe branch already mentioned, it winds un- der the reftus to the anterior margin of the vaf- tus. In its courfe to the patella, it is covered, neat the cruralis, by the margin of the valtus exter- nus; fending branches to the latter, but not to the former. A little above the knee, and near the patella, it approaches fo near the furface, that its laft inofculation with the external arti- cular is frequently feen through the fubltance of the mufcle. It fends a. A Large Branch to the reftus, defcending on its pollerior furface, to which it gives a number of branches—communicating with the anajlomo• tic of the fuperfcial femoral by a double branch, that fends a twig through the vaftus internus to the inferior extremity of the redtus. Tranfverfe Branches—from three to fix—irregu- lar in fize, origin, and diftribution ; rifing vari- oufiy from the outer fide of the defcending trunk upon the vaftus mufcle, and running back- wards to the pofterior parts. Of thefe, a fupe- j rior branch unites with the tranfverfe twigs of the JirJl perforant ; the inferior unite with the external tranfverfe of the f cond perforant, and with the inferior perforant of the fuperfcial ar« 1 tery. N- B. Befides the inofculations of this trunk with the fuperior cxterno-articular, it forms another inofculation with the fuperior inte^no-articular and the anafomotic, by fending a branch, be-' tween the cruralis and re£Uis, to the inner fide 1 of

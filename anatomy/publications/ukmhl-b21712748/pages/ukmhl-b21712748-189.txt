Sett. II. DESCENDING AORTA* 153 E. Many minute branches—riling, through the whole courfe of the artery, between the two bones of the leg, diltributed to the tibia- lis anticus, extenfors, peronei, aponeurolis, and periofteum of the bone, chiefly of the tibia ; varioufly interwoven with one another, and below with the fibular. F. Branches—partly fent off to the extenfor ten- dons while the trunk lies upon the naked tibia, partly fpreading, in a retrograde courfe, on the furface of the bone, covered by the aponeuro- fis, and meeting here the pojlerior tibial and anterior fibular. 0. The internal malleolar—fpreading vari- oufly while running down on the inner ankle ; jnofculating, by afcending branches, with the preceding ramuli, and ftretching, with dejcend- ing branches, to the capfule, aftragalus, os na- viculare, and cuneiforme ; and uniting, in va- rious places, with branches of the internal plan- tar. H. The external malleolar—forming a large communication, in the interoffeous fpace, or a little below it, with the anterior fibular, or fome of its branches—winding to the external ankle, where it fends, if not fooner, branches to the peroneus brevis, the joint, the Ihort common extenfor, and the tendons of the pe- ronei ; forming, under thele tendons, many inofculations with the pojlerior fibular, and anteriorly with the anterior fibular.

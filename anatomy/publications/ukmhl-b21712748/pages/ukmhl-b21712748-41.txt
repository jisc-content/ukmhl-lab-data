9 Sett. I. ARCH OF THE AORTA. the os hyoides, with the oppofite branch, and difiributing twigs to the contiguous mufcles of the os hyoides and tongue, y. Branches penetrating the fibres of the hyogloffus or its interfaces, if the trunk be concealed; proceeding to the mylohyoideus, geniofterno, and coraco-hyoidei, and the digaftric. 2. The Dorfal of the Tongue—running outwards and upwards, near the infertion of the ftyloglof- fus. Having reached the dorfum of the tongue and the epiglottis, it forms a plexus with the branch of the oppofite fide, and is ramified upon the adjoining part of the pharynx. £. The Sublingual—the fuperficial branch of the di- vided trunk, rifing to the fymphyfis, between the fublingual glands and the geniohyoideus, often penetrating the mylohyoideus, and lofing itfelf in the integuments of the chin. If larger, it often fupplies the place of the fubmental ar- tery. In this courfe it fends off many irregular- ly difpofed branches; of which the moft remark- able are, 1. Branches to the fublingual gland. 2. Branches to the geniohyoideus, mylohyoideus, the digaftric, and flein. 3. Branches to the inferior lip. £. Ranina—a larger branch, going off at an obtufe angle from the trunk. It runs tortuoufly be- tween the fibres of the geniogloffus to the fur- face and point of the tongue, paffing along the middle, on the inferior fide. C. The LABIAL, EXTERNAL MAXILLARY, ANGU- LAR, or facial—Concealed by the ftylohy- oideus.

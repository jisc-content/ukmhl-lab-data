99 DESCENDING AORTA. Sea. ii. tranfverfe branch ; fpread varloufly upon both Tides of the gland, and fupply the fat, which fur- rounds the kidneys, with various twigs. . B. The Middle Capfulars—very often double—fent from the aorta, between the phrenics and fupe- rior mefentcric. Thefe fmall branches, proceed- ing tranfverfely to the gland, foon divide ; and give a. Anterior and pofterior branches to the gland. b. Small Phrenic and Adipofe branches. c. Branches, running, upon the right fide, to the neared part of the liver, the vena cava, the co- verings of the duodenum, and the right mefoco- lon ; and upon the left, to the furface of the fpleen and adjoining mefocolon. They frequently unite with the arteries belonging to thofe vifecra. C. The Inferior Capfulars—two or three in num- ber—rifing from the fuperior edge of the renal artery. They afeend outwards; and, after reaching the gland, if they be of confiderable fize, communicate wandering but numerous branches to the neighbouring vifeera, the renal fat, and the adjacent arteries, particularly the fpermatics. VI. The renal, or emulgent artery—Right and Left.—It is unneceflary to enumerate the varieties which anatomifts have obferved as to the number, origin, and magnitude of this artery. It generally rifes (ingle from the fide of the aorta, between the fuperior and infe- rior mefenteric arteries, from which it de- feends tranfverfely at lefs than a right angle. The left, which is rather (hotter than the G 2 right,

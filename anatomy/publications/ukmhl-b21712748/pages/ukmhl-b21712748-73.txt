Sett. I. ARCH OF THE AORTA. 4I l. Branches palling through the openings for the intercoital nerves to the involucra of the fpi- nal marrow, and inofculating with twigs of the vertebral artery. 4. The Thyroid. Branch of the Thyroid Artery.— In this the whole trunk is expended. It bends under the carotid to the fide of the larynx ; and, after repeated windings, reaches the inferior part of the thyroid gland. It finks into the gland •, and, while it divides into many ramifi- cations, is partly diftributed to the whole gland, and partly inofculates with the fuperior thyroid. It gives, 1. Leffer branches to the outer mufcles of the os hyoides and larynx, to the fuperior cartilages of the trachea, and the inferior thyroid gangli- on. Of thefe, the branches which go to the la- rynx form the inferior laryngeal. 2. Pharyngeal branches to the inferior conftri&or mufcles, the cefophagus, and the pofterior muf- cles of the larynx. 3. The Superior Tracheal or Thoracic Branch— often double or triple. One of the branches, defeending with the trachea into the cavity of the thorax, and there forming above the tra- chea a beautiful plexus, communicates with the inferior bronchial and the higher intercofal branches. C. The SUPERIOR INTERCOSTAL ARTERY rifeS mote externally than the vertebral, from the upper and pofterior furface of the trunk; then afeends with it to the hollow that is formed by the anterior fealenus, the furface of the firft rib, and bodies of the vertebras. It is there fuddenly reflected ; and, proceeding to the

5 ARCH OF THE AORTA. Sea. I. the auricle and ventricle to the flat furface and apex of the heart, inofculating freely with the left coronary, both by its branches and the ex- tremity of its trunk. Thefe branches are, a. One running on the right to the aorta, and on the left to the pulmonary artery. b. A number going to both tides of the right au- ricle—to the two yens carte—to the finus be- hind—to the aorta—and to the pulmonary veins. c. Five branches winding on the convex furface of the heart \ the longeft of which unites with the left coronary branches beyond the fepturn, near the apex. d. Branches palling over the plain furface and right ventricle, as far as the apex of the heart. II. The Left Coronary—after going out between the pulmonary artery and the left au- ricle, divides into two branches— a. An Anterior Branch, running upon the convex furface of the heart, towards the fepturn, in a winding direction, to the apex, where it is refledled on the pofterior furface of the heart. This gives, 1. Branches, to the trunks of the arteries, uniting with thofe of the right coronary. 2. Numerous branches to the left ventricle. b. A Circumflex Pofterior Branch, which, wind- ing between the left finus and the ventricle to A 3 the

BRANCHES FROM THE Sett. II. great addu&or, and running extenfively on the inner furface of the flexor mufcles. As it here divides into many branches, fpreading outwards and inwards, it diftributes feveral to each of the flexors and the great addu&or, and forms ma- ny fuperficial and deep communications on thefe mufcles with the internal branch of the inferior eircumfilex, with fome recurrent branches of the feecnd perforant, and fometimes, though more rarely, with twigs of the fuperior perforant ri- ling from the fuperficial. Thefe elegant inof- culations are more frequently obferved upon the femimembranofus, addudlor, biceps, and on the nerve. E. The second perforant—exhibiting a conti- nuation of the trunk—pafies, fometimes fingle, and at others double, through the fmall fpace between the long and (hort addu&or, or thro* the long adductor itfelf; then proceeding o- bliquely outwards and downwards, between the femur and great addudtor, and penetra- ting the addudlor near the linea afpera, at the middle of the thigh, and inner fide of the fhort head of the biceps, is exhaufted, like the lafl artery, among the flexor mufcles by a de- feending perforant branch. To this artery are referred, a. Large Branches—finking into the vaftus inter- nus and long addudtor, before the immerfion of the trunk. b. Another Branch, partly diftributed to the vaftus, partly entering the bone by two twigs, and in- ofculating with the large nutritious artery. c. A

This padage is confider- ably larger than the trunk, loofe cellular fub- ftance, connecting the pleura and peritoneum, being interpofed. The aorta at this place is fe- j parated from the vena cava by the left lobe of the liver, a part of the diaphragm, and a large quantity of cellular fubdance ; but in the fpace between the kidneys and the liver, thefe two vef- fels approach fo near, that the right margin of the artery is partly covered by the vein that afterwards fends fome of its branches anteriorly acrofs. The Ventral Aorta is divided at the vertebra, mentioned above, into two branches of equal fize, forming an acute angle as they run towards the brim of the pelvis. Thefe, anatornids have called Iliac a Communes, or Common Iliacs. The branches of the ventral aorta are bed deferibed in the order in which they occur. I. The phrenic artery—Right and Left— very irregular in origin and divifion. Some- times a Angle trunk, riling above the cceliac, divides into the right and left phrenic : Some- j times, again, and indeed mod frequently, the , right rifes from the cceliac, and the left from the aorta ; while, at other times, they have been obferved riling together, both from the • cceliac, or both from the aorta.

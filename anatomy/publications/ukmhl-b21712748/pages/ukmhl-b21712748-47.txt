ARCH OF THE AORTA. 15 Sea. I. 1 lobe and the helix, and fometimes behind oil the concha. e. Branches to the fplenius and tracheloinaftoid. Of thefe, the defcending branches go to the la- teral and oblique retli mufcles. j. A Large Cervical Branch—palling to the exte- rior margin of the complexus, and going down between this and the trachelomatloid. -J- A Superficial Branch—defcending often to the middle of the neck ; and, giving twigs to the fplenius, complexus, and (kin, at laft inofcu- lates with the tranfverfe thyroid artery of the neck. -J- -{- A Deep Branch—diftributed to the obliqui refti and complexus, and uniting with the ver- tebral artery under the tranfverfe procefs of the atlas. g. The artery, having now bent towards the vertex of the head, branches go off in a retrograde courfe to the fplenius and complexus whilft other branches are fo extenfively ramified, that a great number of them inofculate with the higher twigs of the temporal artery. Of tbefe, one perforates the occipital ridge, and another the pofterior maftoid hole—both of them going to the dura mater. The POSTERIOR AURICULAR, OP STYLOMA- STOID.—This artery rifes from the trunk in the parotid gland, above the digaftric mufcle, and before the ftyloid procefs, and paftes tranf- verfely to the ear. As it afcends in a curved direction behind the ear, it inclines to the pofterior part of the fquamous bone, inof- culating, firft with the temporal, and then with

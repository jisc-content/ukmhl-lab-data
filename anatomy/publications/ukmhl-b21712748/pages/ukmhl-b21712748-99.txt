ARCH OF THE AORTA. Sea. I. 67 Ex + + Branches, verfely above the flexor tendons, where the fuperficial arch is formed, divides, at the root of the fingers, into the digito-radial of the little finger, and the digito-ulnar of the ring finger. Each of thefe runs tortuouf- ly along the fides of the fingers, as far as the apex. This digital likewife gives a. Branches to the third and fourth lumbricals and the tendons of the flexors. b. A branch, communicating with an inferior volar perforant at the bifurcation. c. A branch, forming a fmall arch upon the points of the fingers with the volar artery of the oppo- fite fide. d. Many Cutaneous branches to the dorfal and vo- lar or concave and convex furfaces of the joints of the fingers. e. A branch, refle&ed to the back of the fingers, round the root of the nails. O. The second vola-digital—divided into the digito-radial of the ring finger, and the digito-ulnar of the middle finger. From this proceed, -j- Two branches to the third and fourth lumbri» cals, inofculating with the inferior perforants of the deep arch. + + Branches fimilar to thofe of N. P. The third vola-digital—divided into the digito-radial of the middle, and the digito- ulnar of the fore finger. The laft of which inofculates, on the concave furface, with the digito-radial of the fore finger. It gives + Branches to the firft and fecond lumbricals.

68 BRANCHES FROM THE Sett. I. -{- -f Branches, inofculating with the deep arch and its perforants. + Branches fimilar to thofe of N. Ql branches to the firlt lumbricals, the abduc- tor, addu&or, and flexor of the thumb, the tendons of the flexors, and the Ikin. R. A LARGE ANASTOMOTIC BRANCH Uniting with the radial artery, near the fuperior mar- gin of the addudtor of the thumb.. From this inofculation a trunk is formed, which gives out the vola-radial of the fore finger, and the vola-ulnar of the thumb ; or fometimes the vo/a-ulnar only. S. Many minute branches—iffuing from the concave furface of the arch, and ramified up- on the tendons; afterwards finking deeper to the wrift, inofculating with many twigs of the volainterojjeal. Thus do all the digital branches receive, at the commencement of the bifurcation, the volar perforants and the metacarpals from the deep arch and the dorfo-carpal; but as they ad- vance, difiribute twigs both to the fheaths and tendons of the extenfors. The largeft of thefe inofculates upon the back of the finger, at the-fecond joint, with its fellow of the op- polite fide. Near the nail they form the /mail dorfal, and at the apex the fmall voiar arch of the fingers. The Radial Artery—the fmalleft of the two branches which proceed from the divifion of

ARCH OF THE AORTA. 61 Sea. I. B. The HIGHEST INTEROSSEAL PERFORANT go- ing firft to the internal brachial and capfule, where it forms the anterior arch, by a branch inofculating with the anaflomotic and the ra- dial and ulnar recurrents. After perforating the interftice of the bones, it fends, under the fmall anconeus, a number of recurrent branches upwards to the dorfal arch, and downwards to the extenfor mufcles. The whole artery often rifes from the common in- terojfeal. C. The ulnar recurrent——fent off from the ulnar fide of the trunk, a little above the common interojfeal; and, having paffed through the flexor mufcles, is refleded to the pofte- rior part of the internal condyle. In which courfe are diftributed, a. A branch to the capfule, the flexor mufcles, and ulna. b. A Superficial Branch—covered by the pronator, and afcending, beyond the termination of the brachial mufcle, to the anterior part of the con- dyle, inofculates, upon the internal brachial, with the anafiomotic. In this courfe it diftri- butes many branches to the neighbouring parts. c. A Deep Branch—running between the fublimis and profundus to the cavity between the ole- cranon and flexor condyle ; giving + A branch to the fublimis and profundus. + + Branches to the ulnar flexor, and extenfor of the carpus, and to the periofteum. + +• + Inofculating Branches—uniting, in many places,

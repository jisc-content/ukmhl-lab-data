I5<* BRANCHES FROM THE Sett. II. cions of the flexors; one of them inofculating with the nutritious branch of the poflerior tibial. b. Superficial Branches—difperfed on the aponeu- rofis, to the inferior edge of the patella, and communicating there with the anterior tibial. c. Branches cxhaufted on the common tendon of the extenfors and ligament of the patella. d. Branches to the ligament of the patella, inofcu- lating with the Juperior and inferior externo-ar- ticular. e. A Deep Branch—running along the edge of the internal femilunar cartilage, and inofculating, by a tranjverfe branch, in the hollow of the joint, under the patella, with the inferior exter» no-articular. JV. B. The vafcular plexus, covering the knee, is formed by all the articular arteries, the recur- rent tibial, circumficx, large ana/lomoticy and fome twigs of the perforants. F. Of the muscular branches, which are infi- nitely varied, the following chiefly merit at- tention. a. Two or three Confp'iciious Branches—though often wanting—diftributed to the flexors, but chiefly to the femimembranofus, biceps, and nerve. Thefe fometimes fupply, by reflex branch- es, the want of perforants from the fuperficial femoral. fy. Two Qnflrocncmial Branches—running, in pa- rallel linps, between the heads of the gaftrocne- mius, and penetrating, with various ramifica- tions, the internal fide of the mufcle, in which tbev terminate. Of thefe, one runs, on the fur- face

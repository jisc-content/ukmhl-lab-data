Many branches, rifmg from the anterior part of the trunk, bending upwards and outwards, and terminating, in various ramifications, on the ten- for of the broad fafcia, the middle gluteus, and fometimes on the anterior and lower portion of the great gluteus. y. A Branch, winding outwards between the iliacus and lefler gluteus, and fpreading on the external furface of the pelvis, where it inofculates with the prcfundifjima or deepef branch of the ileum, i. The yInterior Trochanteric Branch — of fmall fize (fometimes very fmall)—lying between the ilia- cus internus and the anterior margin of the vaf- tus externus. It runs, under the middle and lefier gluteus, on the anterior part of the tro- chanter major, where, concealed by a quantity of fat, and terminating in the trochanteric fofia, it inofculates with the pojlcrior trochanteric, af- ter fending branches to the forefaid mufcles, the bones, and the capfule. «. Two or three large Tranfverfe Branches—the laft ramifications of the trunk —covered by the vaftus externus ; winding round the root to the back part of the trochanter, and anaftomofing, upon the tendon of the greater gluteus, or be- yond it, near the bone, with the tranfverfe branch of the firfl perforant and the defending branch of the poferiar trochanteric.

Sett. I. BRANCHES FROM THE 34 DISTRIBUTION of the SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY and its BRANCHES. The fame division is common to the branches of the right and left fubclavian arteries ; but they fo far differ, that the right fubclavian is much larger, pafles obliquely over the trachea, and fends off the common carotid. Having left this branch at the fide of the trachea, it is now more properly the right fubclavian ; and, flill continuing larger than the left, proceeds nearly in a tranfverfe direction. The left fubclavian, on the other hand, while it gradually afcends from the inclining part of the arch, paffes on to its place of deftination with a more rapid and ex- tenfive curvature. Thefe two arteries run in fuch a dirediion, a- bove the fuperior margin of the fir ft rib, as to be concealed for fome time by the clavicle. They then proceed, with the brachial plexus, acrofs that fpace lying between the firft and fe- cond fcalene mufcles; and, being covered by the flattened extremity of the clavicle and the pec- toral mulcle, bend to the axillse, where they take the name of Axillary Arteries.

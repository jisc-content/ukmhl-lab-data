3^ BRANCHES FROM THE Sett. L to this gland; which alfo receives arteries from thofe of the mediaftinum and pericardium. c. A branch accompanying the phrenic nerve—of fmall fize, fupplyir.g the neighbouring parts with twigs, and afterwards uniting at the diaphragm with the phrenic artery of the aorta. d. The Superior and Pojierior Pericardiac Branch— rifing fometimes from the mammary, and fome- times from the fubclavian artery ; fometimes from the aorta or from the common carotid; and as it winds to the upper and back part of the pericardium, diftributes itfelf upon the tra- chea, the glands, the coats of the pulmonary ar- tery, the pericardium, and cefophagus. e. Many Mediaftinal Branches—rifing between the third and fixth ribs ; fome of which go to the thymus gland, and a larger one to the diaphragm. f. Sternal Branches—fpreading varioufly on the back of the fternum, and uniting with branches from the oppofite fide. g. Smaller branches to the pericardium and glands, lying on the vena cava. h. Many branches to the adjoining furface of the LUNGS. i. Many branches going outwards, entering the in- tercoftal fpaces of the fix fuperior ribs; the firft of which are bent to the fternomaftoid, the fter- nohyoid, and the fternothyroid. Others form, at each interftice of the ribs, along with the tho- racic and intercoftal arteries, double inofcula- ting rings; and others, arifing from thefe an- nuli, go to the intercoftal and pe&oral mufcles, the mammae, the obliquus defcendens, and the fkin. k.

DESCENDING AORTA. '3* Sea. IL 1 z ‘ often N. B. All thefe arteries vary often in number and diftribution, and are very irregular in the order in which they are fent off. (I.) The deep femoral—concealed, at its o- rigin, by the fuperjicialfemoral, the glands, and a quantity of fat, lies in the deep triangular ca- vity, between the iliacus, pecflineus, and adduc- tors ; and, bending with a flexure, convex out- wardly, over the united iliacus and pfoas, runs, backwards and downwards, to the higher extre- mity of the vaflus internus. As it reaches the bottom of this cavity, it again bends gently for- wards j and, palling between the long and fliort addudiors and the vaflus internus, Tuns, down- wards and backwards, near to the middle of the femur. At laft, entering the fpace between the long and fliort addu&ors, or perforating this laft mufcle, it reaches the addudlor magnus, and pafles through it, with various branches, run- ning among the poflerior mufcles of the thigh. The firlt direction and flze of the trunk vary conliderably, according as it iflues, fooner or later, from the common femoral, and according to the number and flze of the branches which it fends off. Of thefe, fome are of little confe- quence ; but four of the following merit atten- tion. A. Many small branches—fome of which are

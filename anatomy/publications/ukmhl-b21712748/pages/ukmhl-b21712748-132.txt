S: c7. II. BRANCHES FROM THE portion of the left colon and its iliac flexure ; varies in the fize and number of its branches, ac- cording as the curvature of the inteftine is great- er or lefs. It is often divided into three branch- es, which form anaflornotic arches among them- felves, and with the former. A7. B. The Left Colic gives out alfo branches, forming a plexus with the lumbar branches, and * with fmaller twigs of the fpennatics. C. The Internal Hemorrhoidal—This name is gi- ven to the trunk when it reaches and runs along the polterior part of the redlum. It gives out a. One or two branches to the lower part of the colon. b. Branches encircling the redtum, and uniting an- teriorly, without forming an intermediate arch. c. Branches which, with the middle hcemorrhoidal, the loweft veflcal, Or uterine branch of the hypo- gaflric, inofculate freely at the inferior part of the inteftine, which this artery does not reach. V. Capsular, or atrabiltary—Right and Left. Thefe are diftindt fmall arteries; which, though never Wanting, as they diflribute many branches to the capfular gland, yet, in almofl every individual, they prefent irre- gularities in number, fize, or dire&ion. They do not, like the vein, iflue from one common trunk, but from various branches, coming to- gether near the feat of the gland ; and may therefore be divided into three clafies. A. The Superior Capfular Branches—from two to four in number—riling from the inferior phre- nic sy from their common trunk, or from the tranfverfe

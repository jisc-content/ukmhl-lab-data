BRANCHES FROM THE Sett. I. CO the inferior fide of the opthalmic trunk as it lies upon the optic nerve ; or fometimes from the ciliary arteries. It then finks into the nerve; runs along its axis; penetrates, often double, the medullary expanfion of the retina; and, branching into many new divifions, is exten- fively ramified on its internal furface. Of thefe, fome extending as far as the corpus cili- are, form a circle between it and the vitreous humour, giving twigs to the cryftalline lens; ■while a particular branch pafFes through the centre of the vitreous humour to the polterior fide of the lens. 5. The Long Internal Ciliary Artery. 6. The Inferior Mufcular Artery—rifing from the trunk at the interior margin of the optic nerve, very often between the ciliary arteries, and tranfmitted, either under the eye, or above the addudtor mufcle, to the inferior palpebra. a. Many branches to the deprimens oculi, adduc- tor, optic nerve, and fclerotic coat. 1. Branches to the inferior oblique. e. Branches ipofculating with the infraorbital, and winding on the periofteum of the orbit. I. Branches running to the inferior eye-lid, the tu- nica adnata, and fometimes reaching the lachry- mal fae. 7. The Inferior Ciliary Artery.—This is wanting fometimes. The three ciliary arteries mentioned above, com- monly arife from the opthalmic artery, in fuch a way, that the external follows the external margin of the nerve; the internal, the inner mar- gin ; while the inferior, with fimilar windings, runs near the inferior mufcular, along the lower -margin

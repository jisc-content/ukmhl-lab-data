SeB. I. ARCH OF THE AORTA. 31 of the lachrymal fac and the ligament of the eye-lids, goes to the nofe. a. A branch to the glabella and the frontal mufcles; from which a twig runs tranfverfely. b. A branch, palling down beyond the tarfeal liga- ment to the lachrymal fac, and then to the orbi- cular, where it inofculates with the infraorbital branch. A branch, running down on the fide of the nofe, where it forms a beautiful plexus, by frequent communications with the labial arteries. Ha- ving paffed through the bone and nafal cartilage, it is loft on the Schneiderian or pituitary mem- brane. 1.3. The Frontal .Artery.—at firfl fubcutaneous— pafies over the orbicular mufcle, and then finks in the corrugator. Its branches are, a. A Superciliary Branch—diftributed to the eye- brows and mnfcle3; and inofculating with the temporal and lachrymal arteries. £. A Superficial Frontal Branch—extenfively dif- tributed on the glabella, and rifing as high as the fontanelle or bregma. y. A Deep Frontal Branch —lying under the muf- cles, and diftributed to the pericranium by many ramuli, fome ruhning externally, and others more internally. F. Minute branches, rifing feparately from the trunk, and diftributed to the optic nerve, the infundibulum, the pituitary gland, and the lower part of the plexus choroides. G. The communicating artery.—This, along with the deep branch of the vertebral artery of the cerebrum, forms the circle of Willis. It is tortuous \ but when it leaves the tunica arachnoides.

I. 39 ARCH OF THE AORTA. inofculating, near the coracoid procefs, with the humeral thoracic of the axilla, and again com- municating, at the fuperior angle, with the fu- perfcial artery of the lafe. S. A branch, palling over the outer furface of the fpine of the fcapula ; and, after giving twigs to the bone and the neighbouring mufcles, inofeu- lating with the inferior circumflex fcapular in the infrafpinal cavity. Under the Trapezius, it divides into a. The Superfpinal— the firft branch of the divided artery, palling through the femilunar notch, and diftributing many twigs to the luprafpinatus, is continued onwards, in two branches, under the acromion procefs and fuprafpinatus, where it be- gins to fend branches to the Icspula itfelf, the capfular ligament, the infrafpinatus, the teres minor, and at laft inofculates with the inferior circumflex fcapular. 1. The Supcrfcial Branch of the Lafe of the Sca- pula— larger — proceeds near the lower part of the levator fcapulte to the bafe, and, going down between the ferratus major and the rhom- boid, reaches the inferior angle of the fcapula. In this courfe, it gives many branches to the rhomboid and ferratus; and through them to the trapezius, the ferratus polterior, the Hein, and fubfcapular niufcle : afterwards forms, near the inferior angle, with the inferior fcapular branch, a beautiful circle upon the furface of the ferra- tus; from which branches defeend to the latiffi- mus dorli. Thus does the above remarkable artery, as well as the fuperfpinal, arife often from the fuperior or dorfo-fcapular. I have cbierved, however, that the iranfverfe fcapular fometimes feru s oil the C 4 fuperfpinal

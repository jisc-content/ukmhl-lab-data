17 SeB. I. ARCH OF THE AORTA. g. Higher branches, fpreading under and above the apofieurofis of the temporal mufcle, and inof. culating before with the temporal, and behind with the occipital branches. G. The superficial temporal.—This artery, concealed at fir ft in the parotid gland, rifes in a ftraight line above the zygomatic arch, between the maxilla and meatus auditori- us, and is at laft extenfively ramified on the nponeurofis of the temples and the neigh- bouring parts. In this courfe are fent off, 1. A number of branches to the parotid gland, e- q,ually irregular in fize and number. 2. The Articular Artery of the Maxilla—running to the pofterior part of the meatus auditorius ; fending branches to the articular cartilage, and tranimitting two twigs along the portio dura, through the fiflure of the articulation, where they reach the mufcle of the malleus, and, inof- culating with the ftylomaftoid, form the other half of the coronary artery of the tympanum. 3. Two or three mafleteric branches, going to the mafieter mufcle, and afterwards inofculating with the branches of the coronary artery of the inferior lip and the buccalis, or artery of the cheek. 4. The ‘Iranfverfe Artery of the Face—rifing under the zygoma from the parotid gland, it proceeds tranfverfely to the face along with the falivary dudf. In this courfe, if double, it gives branches to the parotid gland, the articulation of the maxilla, the mafieter, the flcin, the zygomaticus, and the orbicularis palpebrarum. It inofculates with the alveolar, palpebral, infraorbital, and B coronary

164 branches from the Sell. II. O. The external plantar—the larger branch of the pojlerior tibial—palling, gradually outwards and forwards, between the Ihort flexor of the toes and the majfa carnea; or, under this mufcle, to the inner edge of the abdudtor of the little toe. As it proceeds to the bafe of the metatarfal bone of the little toe, between the flexor bre- vis and abdu&or, it runs gradually inwards to the great toe, with alternate flexions; and, palling over the interofieous mufcles, forms the plantar arch ; which, at laft, is wholly recei- ved by the anterior tibial, in the firlt interftice of the metatarfal bones, under the addu&or pollicis. Its branches are, a. A Tranfverfe Anaftomotic Branch—running out- wards upon the naked bone, along the anterior tuberolity of the os calcis, and forming a large inofculation with branches of the anterior ti- bial, at the inner fide of the tuberofity, and with the pojlerior Jibular at the outer fide; con- ftituting, at the fame time, a vafcular plexus, from which many branches are fent to the bone, flexor brevis, aponeurofis, and fkin. b. Branches to the large ligament of the calcaneum. c. Many Branches—while the trunk runs above or below the mafia carnea, and pafles, expofed, be- tween the flexor and abdu&or minimus, fent to this mufcle and the flexor brevis, and thro* this, or near its external margin, liberally diftri- buted to the aponeurofis and flcin. d. The Firjl Deep Branch, or Fir/l Profunda—run- ning to the abdudor and flexor of the little toe, and uniting with the pojlerior Jibular on the external and lateral part of the calcaneum, and with

Sefl. I. ARCH OF THE AORTA. 55 D4 D. The DISTRIBUTION of the BRACHIAL ok HUMERAL ARTERY. The Axillary Artery is firfl known by the name of Humeral or Brachial, where it proceeds from the ax.Ila to the internal fide of the arm. Having left the cavity of the axilla, and pafied to the internal furface of the tendon of the teres major, it continues its courfe above the internal brachial to the inner fide of the biceps, and gradually runs along the midtile of the arm to the anterior furface of its extre- mity ; where at laid, concealed under the apo- neurofis of the biceps, it divides, near the bend of the fore-arm, into the Ulnar and Radi t Arteries. A. A branch—going down, near the tendon of the teres major, under the coracobrachial, to the bicipital groove, and giving recurrent twigs to the head of the humerus and cap- fule. B. Branches to the long and internal anconei, and coracobrachial. C. Many branches—going out, in various pla- ces, to the biceps, the internal brachial, and bone.

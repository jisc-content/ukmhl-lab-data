BRANCHES FROM THE Sett. II. 142 y. A Branch, concealed in the fubllance of the bi- ceps. Branches, meeting the defcending branch of the circumflex on the vailus externus, and fometimes the fuperior externo-articular, with a large twig. They appear to rife from the nutritious branch in fuch a manner, that it feems to be inflefted through the Ihort head of the biceps to the vaf- tus externus. g. Many Branches, diftributed to the Ihort head of the biceps. h. A Defcending Perforant—palling under the flex- ors, after perforating the addudtor, and tranf- mitting ramuli to the external and internal flex* ors. Like g of the jirjl perforant, it forms, up- on the furface and fubftance of thefe mufcles, inofculations upwards with this artery, and downwards with thz perforant of the fupcrficial. (II.) The superficial femoral artery— lying near the external integuments j covered, through its whole courfe, by the broad faj'cia, by the inguinal glands above, and on the middle part by the fartorius as it runs obliquely acrofs the femur. It then proceeds downwards, in- wards, and backwards, palling gradually from the anterior to the inner furface of the thigh, and from that to the pofterior part and hollow of the ham or poples. At firft it is feparated from the deep femoral by a quantity of fat and by the glands; then lies upon the vaftus internusj and, palling along in a declivity between the vaftus internus and addu&ors, enters the oblique canal in

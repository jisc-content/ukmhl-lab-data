The Tranfverfe Scapular—the lowed; branch of the thyroid artery, but fometimes of confider- able fize—is covered at firft by the fternoma- ftoid, and pafies tranfverfely to the fcapula, un- der the trapezius. The fuperjicial cervical fome- times fupplies the place of its fuperior fcapular branch. a. Branches going feparately to the ilernomaftoid, the fternohyoid, the omohyoid, and the fubcla- vian mufcles, the coats of the arteries and veins, and the fkin of the neck and bread. h. The Superjlcial Scapular Branch—giving twigs to the integuments on the top of the Ihoulder and furface of the trapezius and deltoid. C. Branches to the pofterior part of the trapezius. d. Branches to the levator fcapulae, and the ferra- tus. Thus is the artery often wholly expended. At other times, it finks deep under the trapezius, in many tortuous windings, where it properly takes the name of fuperior fcapular, or dorfo- fcapular; and is chiefly divided into two fmaller trunks, fending previoufly oflF a.

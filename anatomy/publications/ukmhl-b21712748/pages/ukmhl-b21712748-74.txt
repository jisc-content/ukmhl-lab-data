Afcending branches, irregular in number and fize, to the fcaleni, the longus colli, and the nerves. b. Branches to the intercoftal mufcles of the firft and fecond interftices, which run along the mar- gins of the ribs, forming circular inofculations with the higher thoracic branch and the branch- es of the internal mammary, c• Numerous Oejophageal Branches—inofculating with the Jupcrior tracheal branch of the thyroid artery. ■ d. Branches fent through the openings for the nerves to the hollow of the fpine, and there diftributed both to the involucra and the me- dulla. e. Branches palling over the third rib, and inofcu- lating with twigs of the jirft inferior intercoftal. f Deep branches, palling through the intercoftal fpaces to the deep mufcles of the back and neck. D. The vertebral artery—larger than the former, rifes from the fuperior fide of the fubclavian ; and, afcending a little backwards, covered by the ganglions of the intercoftal and the cellular membrane, reaches the per- forations of the tranfverfe proceftes of the cer- vical vertebras Through thefe it penetrates, and, riling perpendicularly from the fixth, or fometimes from the fifth or fourth opening, reaches the aperture of the atlas, where it bends a little outwards; and having palled through,

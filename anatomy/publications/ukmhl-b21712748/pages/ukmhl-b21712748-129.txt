The appendicular—reaching, behind the coecum, to the fmall mefeatery of the ver- miform procefs; and, as it runs along this, giving ftraight and fhort twigs to the pro- cefs. ■h An Iliac Branch —winding to the left, and forming an arch, near the ileum, with the extremity of the mefenteric trunk, from which the ileum receives new branches. Branches, varying in number, from twelve to twen ty, rife clofe to one another from the left con- vex fide of the fuperior mefenteric, diftributing ramuli to the ileum and jejunum. Of thefe, the fuperior are fhort and {lender; the middle long and thick; the inferior fhorteft ; and the laft branch of all, as obferved above, inofculates with the ileo-colic. Running near and parallel to each other, they fit ft proceed tranfverfely ; then, riling between the layers of the mefentery, di- vide into fmaller branches, which fo diverge, that in whatever dire&ion they go, they are foon after divided into two. Thefe branches, as they meet, form various arches, from whofe convex margin new parallel branches arife; which a- gain foon dividing, inofculate with the adjacent branches, forming fmaller and more numerous arches. From the convexity of thefe arches other branches arife, forming a third feries of arches ; and where the branches are longeft, e- ven a fourth or fifth feries; till the laft branches, near the inteftines, dividing into anterior and pofterior.

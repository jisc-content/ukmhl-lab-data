There are fometimes three or four phrenic arteries, which, as foon as they arife, bend obliquely outwards, before the crura of the diaphragm, to the inferior margin of its tendinous alse ; and, while they here wind tortuoufly under its flefhy fibres, diftribute various twigs, up- wards, outwards, inwards, and downwards. Bending at laft to the external margin of the tendon, and, palling between the mufcular layers, they run forwards, and inofculate, up- on the collal mufcles, with the thoracic veflels and the artery of the oppofite fide. At the bend of the artery, however, they fend a larger branch to the pofterior and inferior portion of the diaphragm as it rifes from the ribs. Be tides the branches of the diaphrag- matic tendon and mufcle, the following like- wife merit attention : A. Branches going to the two Tides of the renal cap- ' fu'.es, and adipofe fubftance lying on the kid- neys. See a defcription of thefe arteries below, fe. Branches—uniting, after penetrating the dia- phragm, with the accompanying branch of the phrenic nerve, and the other fhrenics rifing from the mammary. C.

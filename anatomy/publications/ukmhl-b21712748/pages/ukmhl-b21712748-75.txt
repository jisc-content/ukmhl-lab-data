Through this opening;, ha- ving at lafl: entered the cranium, it proceeds upwards and forwards, and at the balilar a- pophylis, under the medulla oblongata, meets, at an acute angle, with the vertebral artery of the oppofite lide, forming the bajilat ar- tery to be diftributed to the cerebrum and cerebellum. It gives, in this courfe, 1. Lateral branches to the mufcles between the tranfverfe proccfles, and others, near to the ver- tebrae. 2. Larger branches, palling through the interverte- bral openings for the nerves, to the coverings of the medulla, and inofculating with the ante- rior and pofterior fpinal branches. 3. A branch going, with various twigs, from the firlt bend of the artery to the rectus poiticus major and minor, the obliquus major and mi- nor, the trachelomaftoid, and complexus; and inofculating with branches reaching from the occipital artery. 4. Pcjlerior Meningeal Branches—proceeding from the fecond and third flexures, and winding for- wards upon the dura mater of the cerebellum, as far as the clinoid procefles and receptacle, and backwards towards the occiput. Before the formation of the bafilar artery, there are fent off in the cranium itfelf— 5. The

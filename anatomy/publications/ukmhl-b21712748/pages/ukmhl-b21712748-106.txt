BRANCHES FROM THE n Sett. /. + Double branches, inofculating with the fuperior volar perforants. + + Branches communicating with the JlrJl and third, and diftributing twigs, fimilar to the former, at a. d. The Third Metacarpal, or Dorfo-interojfeal—run- ning, like the laft, in the fourth interval of the fingers, and forming fimilar inofculations with the adjoining arteries. Sometimes one or other of the metacarpals is produced from the perfo- rants. The DORSO -RADIAL, or LARGE, Or RADIAL IN- TEROSSEAL of the index—rifing between the fn-ft and fecond metacarpal bones, while the trunk penetrates the inferior margin of the abdudlor or femi-interofleus; and, following the courfe of the interofieous, inofculates on the index with the volar artery of the fame finger. a. Branches to the abdu&or, articulation, and ex- tenfor tendons of the index. b. Branches inofculating with the dorfal of the thumb. R. The polli car, or principal artery of the thumb—rifing from the radial trunk, where it finks among the mufcles to the palm of the hand between two metacarpal bones; and, di- viding' into two branches, runs to the volar fide of the thumb, between its abdu&or -and addu&or mufcles. It generally gives a. Many branches to the back of the metacarpal bone and ack!u£tor of the thumb. b. A Deep Branch to the radial and ulnar fefamoid bones,

The Small Defcending Branch—rifing fometimes from the fuperjicial, fometimes from the large tranfverfe branch of the circumflex : firft fend- ing twigs, under the reftus, to the fartorius and vaftus internus ; then winding inwards through the fubftance of this mufcle, inofculates at laft, under the tendon of the triceps, with the infe- rior perforant of the fuperjicial femoral, or, more frequently, with the large anaflomotic. I have obferved it, at other times, pafs outwards to the cruralis and vaftus externus. C. The internal circumflex—rifes, near the origin of the external circumflex, from the in- ternal and pofterior part of the trunk ; pafies to the interior and middle part of the pe&ine- us through the adipofe fubftance, between this mufcle and the tendon of the pfoas, and runs deeply and'tranfverfely backwards, above the trochanter minor. Concealed here by mufcles and fat, it divides into branches, between the fhort and great adduCtor, or between the ad- ductor and pedtineus. Of thefe branches, the largeft, confidered as the trunk, approaches the neck of the femur, acetabulum, and obtu- rator externus, and, proceeding outwards and backwards to the interftice between the qua- dratus and adduCtor magnus, divides into two branches and is partly expended on the muf- cles attached to the femur, and partly through I 4 the

l 1L DESCENDING AORTA. *49 D. The INFERIOR EXTERNO-ARTICULAR riHng below the knee joint, under the plantaris and external head of the gaftrocnemius; runs, out- * wards and upwards, to the top of the fibula, and there entering, under the external lateral ligament and aponeurofis, a groove which is formed in the external femilunar cartilage, proceeds, between the femur and the head of the fibula, to the patella. a. Separate Branches—diftributed to the poplite- us, foleus, gaftrocnemius, fkin, and periofteum. b. A Branch, forming a confpicuous inofculation with the tibial recurrent. c. A Superficial Branch—fent off while the trunk refts upon the cartilage •, tranfmitting many fmall ramuli to the vafcular plexus of the knee, the aponeurofis, and fkin ; and inofculating with the fuperior externo-articular. d. Small Branches—entering the femilunar carti- lage, periofteum, and capfule. e. A Deep Branch—entering the capfule near the patella, and fpreading out its various ramifica- tions within the cavity of the joint. E, The inferior interno-articular—defend- ing a little, as it runs inwards below the joint, between the fuperior edge of the popliteus and the gaftrocnemius, to the pofterior angle of the condyle of the tibia; and then palling, un- der the internal lateral ligament of the knee, and the tendons of the internal flexors, to the lower margin of the patella. a. Many Branches—terminating in the popliteus, pofterior and crucial ligaments, capfule and ten- K 3 dons

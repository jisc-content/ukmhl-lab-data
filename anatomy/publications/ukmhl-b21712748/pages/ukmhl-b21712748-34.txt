BRANCHES FROM THE Set1. 1. 6 the rounded extremity of the heart, terminates towards the apex, upon the flat furface. It gives * Branches, running upwards, and extenfively ra- mified on the left finus and the left auricle, and proceeding at lad to the inferior vena cava. ■ * * Branches, lofing themfelves in the mufcle of the left fide of the heart. N- B. A third branch is fometimes found funk deep in the feptum. The coronary arteries run in innumerable twigs to each mufcular fafciculus of the heart; and wherever they approach the branches of the phrenic, internal mammary, and bronchial arteries, they communicate with them by frequent modulations. Ill The Right Subclavjan.t—For the de- fcription of this and tjie Left one, fee below. IV. The Common Carotid—has on each fide a fimilar diltrifnnion of its branches, though the Right be a little larger than the Left. It lies on the anterior furface of the vertebrae, and is united by cellular membrane to the in- tercoftal nerve—the par vagum beneath, and the internal jugular vein above. It thus afcends in one continued trunk in a ftraight diredlion, and parallel to the Trachea, as high as the fupe- rior margin of the thyroid cartilage. It there di- vides into branches of equal (ize ; the anterior of which is called the external carotid; and the po- sterior, the internal or cerebral. PISTRI-

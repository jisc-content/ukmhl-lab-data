BRANCHES FROM THE Sett. I. D. The DEEP BRANCH of the HUMERUS, the LARGE COLLATERAL, Or LARGE HUMERAL PRO- FUNDA—fometimes double—riling, from the inner fide of the trunk, at the inferior mar- gin of the teres major; but fometimes fooner, from the inferior fcapular or pojlerior circum- flex. It proceeds backwards, with a gentle curve; and, accompanying the long extenfor, runs to the cavity between the anconei muf- cles, where, in the pafiage of the fpiral nerve, it divides into two branches, at the upper junc- tion of the external anconeus and internal brachial. It gives a. A branch to the long and external anconei. b. A branch to the biceps, coracobrachial, the pe- riofteum, the tendon of the teres major, and the deltoid ; inofculating with twigs of the anterior circumflex, and with other branches of the hu- meral artery. C. A branch, ramifying on the coracobrachial, inter- nal brachial, the bicipital groove, and the bone. d. Many diftinft branches, fent cfF from the trunk in its defcent ; fome of them afcending to in- ofculate with branches of the humeral and fca- pular arteries, and others defceuding to be ra- mified on the mufcles. e. The Large Communicating Radial, or Profun- da-radial.—The external branch of the divided trunk, which, winding between the external an- coneus and brachial to the fpine of the con- dyle, forms, around the external or extenfor condyle, anaftonootic arches with the radial re- current}

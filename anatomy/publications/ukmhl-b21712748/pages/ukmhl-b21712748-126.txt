Seel. II. 9 2 BRANCHES FROM THE to the right. After giving off fraaller branch- es, the trunk fends from its right fide only two branches to the large inteftines; but from the left it gives a greater number of branches to the fmall inteftines. Thefe are, A. Pofterior Pancreatics—numerous—penetrating the right and left fides of the pancreas, and in- ofculating with the pancreatico-duodena/, tranf- verfe pancreatic, and the fplenico-pancreatics. Some of thefe pafs through the mefocolon to the colon itfelf. B. The Left Inferior Duodenal—two or three of them—rifing from the left fide of the trunk, and ftretching to the inferior and left curvature of the inteftine. While fome twigs are refle£t- ed, upwards and backwards, in the form of arches, the reft inofculate varioufly with the fa- perior duodenals, the pancreatico- duodenal before this gland, and with their fellows. Thefe branches, however, are very irregular. C. The Superior or Medio-colic—rifes fometimes a- bove the duodenal branches ; but generally be- low them, under the duplicature of the mefo- colon, and runs along the tranfverfe mefocolon from the left, forwards, and to the right, to the right colon and adjoining part of the tranfverfe colon. It fometimes rifes double •, but more frequently, after running a fhort way upon the mefocolon, divides into two branches, viz. a. The Tranfverfe Colic—palling, in the duplica- ture, along the middle of the mefocolon, to the concave fide of the tranfverfe colon, after having full divided, fooner or later, about three inches from

106 BRANCHES FROM THE Sett. II. fimilar diredtion upon the right and left fides. The Right Iliac erodes the lower part of the ve- na cava, near the origin of the iliac vein. The Left leans on the outfide of its concomitant vein, but does not cover it. A little below, each divides into two branches: The one, na- med the Internal Iliac or Hypogajlric, finks into the cavity of the pelvis ; the other, called the External Iliac, paffes to the thigh, where it takes the name of Femoral. Except the facro-mediauJ and, at times, fome minute ureterics, inofcula- ting, upwards and downwards, with branches of the fame name, and others difperfed to the adjoining fat of the peritoneum and the lumbar glands, no other arteries, in general, take their origin from the common iliacs. The sacro-median—of the fame fize as the lum- bar, is an azygous artery; and, riling from the bifurcation, or a little higher from the mid- dle of the aorta, or from one of the lumbars, or fometimes from the iliac, runs down a- Jong the middle of the anterior furface of the os facrum, as far as the coccyx, where it forms, with the facro- laterals, an arch that is convex downwards. In its defeent it gives a. Tranfverfe Branches—three or four in num- ber—running outwards in undulating lines, and communicating, upon the furface of the facral vertebras, with the fucro-latcrals.

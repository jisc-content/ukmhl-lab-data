G Branches from the Sea. /. D. The ANTERIOR ARTERY of the RECEPTACLE—> riling above the root of the intercoftal nerve. Some anatomifts, from fuppofing the inter- coftal to have its origin from the firft branch of the fifth pair, have miftaken this artery for a nerve. <*. Branches to the 3d, 4th, and the three divifions % of the 5th pair, with which they go out. Many branches to the dura mater of the recep- tacle, near the fphenoidal fiffure, and fome to the pituitary gland. The cpthalmic artery—riling in the an- gle where the carotid artery leaves the fphe- noid bone, near its anterior clinoid procefies, and running with the nerve which accom- panies, and refts upon it, through the optic hole, to the orbit of the eye. In mentioning its branches, and their fubdivifions, I fhall obferve the order which Nature generally points out in fending them from the trunk. After lying by the external fide of the optic nerve, it pafles obliquely forwards over the' nerve; and reaching the internal angle of the eye above its adductor mufcle, divides into two branches; and thefe again into the following fmaller branches: r. The Lachrymal—rifing from the opthalmic ar- tery, -about two lines after it enters the orbit^ between the abduttor and the levator; and then running above the abdu£tor, proceeds to the lachrymal gland. It fometimes goes off from th'e middle meningeal artery. a. A

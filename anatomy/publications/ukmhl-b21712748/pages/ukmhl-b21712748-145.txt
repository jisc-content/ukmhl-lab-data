A branch to the veficulx feminales, vas deferens, and proftate gland—running up between the bladder and reeftum, and inofculating both at the veficulx and beyond the proftate gland, with the profunda penis, or deep perineal and the branch from the oppofite fide. b. A branch—going to the bulb, and anaftomofing with branches of the common pudic. E. The middle hemorrhoidal artery—ir- regular in its origin, and fometimes wanting; but, in general, rifes between the pudic and poflcjior iliac, or the pudic iifelf.

Sometimes it is fo large as to give off both the uterines and facro-lateral.—In men it gives, a. Numerous branches, winding on the rectum through its whole defeent, and inofculating of- ten with the mefenteric hemorrhoidal and tire branches of the oppofite fide. b. Branches, running down to the external fphinc- ter.

Sett. II. DESCENDING AORTA. 139 bliquely outwards, between the femur and that part of the great addudor which is at- tached to the bone. About an inch from the great trochanter, it perforates the addudor in two places, under the covering of the great gluteus; to which, along with the flexors, it diftributes its ultimate branches. From this arife, a. Large Branches—fometimes rifing feparately from the deep femoral—exhaufting themfelves upon the vaftus internus, and the fhort and great addudors. b. Branches, fpreading out from the concealed trunk to the addudor, quadratus, and trochanter. c. An Afcending Branch—forming, above the fu- perior extremity of the great addudor, an ele- gant inofculation with the defcending branch of the pojlerior trochanteric. d. A Large TranfverfeP>r&nch—fometimes double — running, under the addudor, to the gluteus; and, after perforating the tendon of this mufcle, proceeding outwards, round the root of the tro- chanter, to the vaftus externus, where it inofcu- lates with the large tranfverfe branch of the ex- ternal circumflex. e. A Branch—often double —rifing, as it were, from the former ; pafling through the addudor to the great gluteus, and there dividing into various branches, inofculating with the gluteal branches of the ifchiadic. f. A Nutritious Branch—running down upon the furface of the bone, and anaftomofing with a nutritious branch of the fccond perforant. g. A Defcending Perforant—palling through the great

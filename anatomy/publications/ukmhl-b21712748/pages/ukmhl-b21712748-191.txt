The Firjl Dorfo-metatarfal, or Dorfo-intcroffeal— lying in the fpace between the fecond and third metatarfal bones and the interofleous mufcle ^ and, after running to the root of the toes, and giving branches to the extenfor tendons, and others, to inofculate with the pofterior and an- terior perforants and tranfvcrfe metatarfal, ex- liaulting iffclf in the bifurcation of the planta- digital artery. yf. The Second Dorfo-metatarfal> or Dorfo-intproffeal —running, like the laft, to the third interval, and terminating in a fimilar manner. g. The Third Dorfc-mctatarfal, or Dcrjo-interoffcal —riling near the os cuboides ; running in the fourth interval of the metatarfal bones, and Ap- plying fimilar branches as the former metatar- fals. jo. A Branch—rifing at the fifth metatarfal bone from the inofculation of the travfverfe tarjal and external plantar ; running along this bone, and exhaulting icfelf, by forne ramuli, upon the adduttor of the little toe. N. B. The Dorfo-metaiarfals, ox Dcrfo-interoffeaiss often arife from the tranfvcrfe metatarfal; in which pafe, the tranfvcrfe tarfal only produces minute branches, incfculating, near their origin, with the dorfo-mctatarfals. Sometimes, alfo, the dorfo-metatarfals give origin, by meeting with the perforants, to one or two planta-digi- tal branches ; or produce other digitals, fpread- ing on the back of the toes, and inofculating with the true digitals of the external plantar \ or

DESCENDING AORTA. 129 Sed. II. THE COMMON FEMORAL. 4 The common femor^k is a continuation of the External Iliac, where it runs without the Fal- lopian ligament in the groin. The femoral vein, under which it lies, conceals its internal margin, while the whole is covered by a large quantity of cellular fubftance, fat, a number of inguinal glands, and the broad fafcia of the thigh. Af- ter advancing about two inches, it divides, on the outer and mufcular part of the iiiacus internus, into two arteries of nearly equal fize. Of thefe, the one, which is a continuation of the trunk, is called the Superficial Femoral j and the other, which rifes from the back part of the trunk, the Deep Femoral, or Femoral Profunda. From the common trunk generally ifliie A. Small branches—palling over the Fallopian ligament, and running extenlively upwards to the Ikin of the abdomen. B. Inguinal branches—varying in number; wandering through the fat, and chiefly dis- tributed to the inguinal glands. C. A smaller branch—which immediately di- vides into ramuli, running outwards and tranf- I yerfely.

BRANCHES FROM THE Seel. L 1% of the temporal artery of the fame name upon the furface of this niufcle. 3. The Inferior Labial, or Superficial Branch—rifes, often double, from the trunk, goes forwards, and, having fent branches to the buccinator, the de- preflors of the angle of the mouth and lips, and the orbicular, diftributes others, uniting with the inferior labial of the oppofite fide, with the inferior coronary, and the inferior maxillary; and then pafles under the depreflor of the angle of the mouth to the inferior lip, dividing into two, and fometijnes producing the inferior coronary of the lip. 9. Many branches, fpreading outwards above the buccinator, and interwoven with the tranfverfe of the face, the buccal, and the alveolar. jo. The Coronary of the Inferior Lip—goes off near the angle of the mouth, and, covered by the depreflor of the angle and the orbicular, proceeds towards the cavity of the mouth, in a winding and tranfverfe direction, under the membrane of the mouth, to its fellow of the op- pofite fide, with which it inofculates. From this are diftributed, J. Branches to the mafieter, the parotid gland, Steno’s duft, the buccinator, and the orbicular. 3. Branches defeending to the quadratus and ikin, and inofculating with the neighbouring arteries. 11. The Coronary of the Superior Lip—like the preceding, but larger and more tortuous, pafles under the greater zygomatic and the orbicular mufcles, runs along the margin of the fuperior lip, and gives 1.

BRANCHES FROM THE Sett. 1. 64 y. A branch, anaftomofing with the highejl inter- ojfeal perforant. S. The Ulnar Branch—the firft artery of the divi- ded trunk, bending to the pofterior furface of the ulna, along with the tendon of the ulnar ex- tenfor; and inofculating with the perforating branches of the radial artery, the middle branch, and the dorfal of the hand. The Middle Branch—larger than the reft; fink- ing under the ligament of the carpus to the ten- dons, the ligaments, and lkin ; forming a plexus with the perforating branches, the dorfo carpal, and its fellows. The Radial Branch—accompanying the fecond tendon of the radial extenfor, and inofculating with the preceding twig under the ligaments, as alfo with the firft metacarpal branch of the dorfo-carpal, and the radial perforants. Thefe three, in conjunction with the dorfo-carpal and dorfal of the hand, form a beautiful plexus a- round the carpus. /. The Vola-interofjeal—the other branch of the trunk covered by the pronator, running to the naked ligaments of the carpus, where, after fupplying with many twigs the ulna, radius, and the articulation of the wrift, it forms a vaf- cular plexus with the recurrent branches of the deep volar arch. In this courfe it forms other minute inofculations with the radial and uhjar. F. Many branches—rifing from the defcend- ing trunk ; irregular in number and fitua- tion, and going to the long flexor of the thumb, the radial nerve, the radial and ulnar flexors.

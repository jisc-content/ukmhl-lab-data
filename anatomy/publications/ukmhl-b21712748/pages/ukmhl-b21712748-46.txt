Sect. I BRANCHES FROM THE the ftylopharyngeus, the Euftachian tube, and the pendulous velum ; others to the re&us mi- nor, the cuneiform bone, the cartilage occupy- ing the anterior part of the foramen lacerum— and others to the internal parts of the noftrils, and the pterygoid canal. 2. Thofe paffing Outwards.—Of which the moll remarkable are, «. Branches to the firft intercoftal ganglion and the par vagum. £. Branches to the fternomaftoid and the conglobate glands of the neck. y. A branch paffing through the opening with the jugular vein, and extending its minute twigs even to the cavernous finus. E. The occipital artery—pafles tranfverfely before the jugular vein, above the redtus la- teralis, proceeding between the tranfverfe pro- cefs of the atlas and the maftoid procefs, to the back part of the neck, and riles, in many wandering branches, to the occiput. In its courfe it is covered by the digaftric, the tra- chelomaftoid, the fplenius, and complexus; and becomes fubcutaneous as it reaches the occiput. Its branches are, a. One to the digaftric and ftylohyoideus. b. Branches to the glands of the neck and the fter- nomaftoid, inofculating with the afcending thy- roid artery. c. A Meningeal Branch—which enters the cranium along with the jugular vein, and is diftributed to the furface of the dura mater of the cerebel- lum. d. An Auricular Branch—diftributed to the leffier lobe

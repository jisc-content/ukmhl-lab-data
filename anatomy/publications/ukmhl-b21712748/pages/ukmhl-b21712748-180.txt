M4 Srfi. II. BRANCHES FROM THE branch of the anterior tibial. Like the follow- ing artery, it often rifes feparately from the fe- moral trunk. c. A Branch—rifmg in the tendinous canal, and accompanying the tendon of the triceps which covers it, to the inner condyle of the femur, where, running downwards, it fpreads into va- rious ramifications. It alfo fends off a branch under the tendon, as it is attached to the con- dyle, which runs tranfverfely, upon the periof- teum of the condyle, to the common tendon of the extenfors and the external condyle, where it forms an arch, around this extremity of the femur, with $ie fuperior and inferior externo- articulars, and alfo diftributes twigs to the ca- vity of the joint. d. A Branch—running tranfverfely, perforating the vaftus near the rectus, and inofculating, on the fubftance of this laft mufcle, with a branch of the external circumflex. e. A Branch—riGng in a fimilar manner from the vaftus, and inofculating, on the furface of the knee, with the articular branches. fl A Branch—palling upwards, anaftomofing, up- on the vaftus or cruralis, with the fmall defend- ing branch of the circumflex. C. The superior perforant—ifiuing from the outer fide of the trunk, where it lies concealed by the tendon of the triceps; and, bending tranfverfely backwards, between the pofterior furface of the bom? and the inferior mufcular part of the great addudor, near the origin of the fliort head of the biceps, penetrates the fibres of this mufcle, or thofe of the ad- dudor,

Sett. II. DESCENDING AORTAf 91 gajlric, with which it inofculates, follows the large curvature of the ftomach. a. Pancreatic Branches. p. Large EJploics— three or four in number; one of which is ufually larger than the reft, but all diftributed to the omentum and co- lon. y. Gajlric Branches—inofculating with the coronaries on the furface of the ftomach. e. The Vafa Brevia, or Short Branches—three or four in number— iflue from the trunk as it reaches \ the depreffion of the (pleen ; and diftribute their ramuli to the fundus of the ftomach. where they fpread, in various directions, on its furface, and inofculate with many of the neighbouring branches. N. B. A branch is fometimes fent from the fplenic to the tranfverfe colon, anaibomoftng with the medio colic. III. The superior mesenteric—the largelt of the abdominal or ventral branches—riling be- tween the crura of the diaphragm, three or four lines below the cceliac, from the anterior part of the aorta, and under the lower edge of the pancreas; proceeds between this gland and the inferior tranfverfe flexion of the duo- denum. Palling over this portion of the in- tefline, it bends to the right under the mefo- colon ; where, received near the vertebrae into the folds of the mefentery, it lirfl; in- clines to the left, and then to the right; where the whole artery, advancing to the right ile- um, aflumes the form of the Roman S, with the concave fide of its large curvature looking to

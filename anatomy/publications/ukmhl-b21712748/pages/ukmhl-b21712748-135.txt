IOI G 3 liver It generally has its origin between the renal and mefenteric arteries, though the right and left do not always iffue from the fame place; the left often rifing higher, and proceeding frequently from the renal or the inferior cap- fular. I have obferved, at times, two on each fide. It defcends from the aorta fomewhat tortuoufly, at a very acute angle, behind the peritoneum, and pafles before the vena cava on the right fide. It is more tortuous in wo- men than in men, in whom it pafles through the abdominal ring. It joins its concomitant vein upon the furface of the pfoas mufcle. Received by the fpermatic cord, it is divi- ded, at fome inches before reaching the teftes, into five branches: two of which go to the head and oppofite extremity of the epididy- mis ; while the reft, running down to the tefticle itfelf, penetrate the tunica albuginea, and fend off new branches in every diredtion; which, proceeding in a winding courfe, and refletfted to the inferior margin of the teftes, are partly exhaufted on its fubftance, and partly on the convolutions of the feminife- rous ffudls. Without any perceptible dimi- nution of diameter, the artery fends out in this courfe, A. Middle and Inferior Adipofe Branchesâ€”traver- fing the middle region of the kidney. See be- low.

THE AUTHORâ€™S PREFACE. X But as the honour of difcovering the circulation is due to the immortal Harvey, fo it is chiefly owing to him that anatomifts have ftudied the arteries with fuch attention, without confining themfelves fo parti- cularly as the ancients, to the defcription of the veins. The circulation being difcovered, the inquirers into Nature foon invented the art of imitating it, by means of a ceraceous preparation, in the dead fubject, and thereby of inveftigating the veffels with more accura- cy. They perceived foon, that the difiribution of the arteries, even where their ramifications are moft mi- nute, are much more regular than the veins; and that the branches of thefe laft, being infinitely diverfified, feem fcarcely to admit of a certain and uniform de- fcription. By fuch difcoveries, an ardent and inflexible perfeverence being roufed in anatomifis, they began to fcrutinil'e every part of the human body feparately.; and not only corrected many ancient errors which had crept into the fcience, but obferved alfo, in every part, the principal varieties which fometimes take place in the difiribution of its arteries; and thus, as might well be expected, obtained a much more accu- rate knowledge of the firudture than could be acqui- red by thofe who examined the whole body in a fu- perficial and general manner.

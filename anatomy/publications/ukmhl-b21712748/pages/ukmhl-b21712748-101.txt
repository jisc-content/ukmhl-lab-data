6y Sea. I. ARCH OF THE AORTA. E 3 b. Branches of the humeral. It runs down, in a flraight line, upon the furface of the pronator, and gra- dually inclines towards the radius, between the long fupinator and radial flexor, refling on the flexor of the thumb. At the lower extremity of the radius, where it is eafily felt between the ftyliform procefs and the trapezium, on the back of the hand, it bends under the abdu&or and extenfor of the thumb, near the firfl radial extenfor; then penetrating the abdu&or or fe- mi-interofleous of the fore finger, between the metacarpal bone of the fore finger and thumb, bends, while there concealed, to the palm, be- tween the fibres of the addudtor pollicis, and forms, in the hollow of the hand, under the flexors, and above the interofleous mufcles, the deep volar archy in which it terminates. A. A branch, dividing upwards and downwards, to the fupinator longus and the radial exten- fors; fometimes inofculating with the fmall humeral -profunda. B. The radial recurrentâ€”reflected round the tendon of the biceps, to the external con- dyle ; concealed between the long fupinator, the fliort radial extenfor, and internal bra- chial, where it forms, like the ulnar recur- rent, important incfculations, and gives a. Branches to the pronator rotundus, fhort fupina- tor, and radial extenfors; which, in their de- fcent, inofculate with other recurrent ramuli.

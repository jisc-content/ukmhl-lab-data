BRANCHES FROM THE Sett. II, the right lobe and the lobulus anony- mus. C. The Splenic.—While this artery runs along the upper furface of the pancreas, and pafies tranf- verfely to the depreflion of the fpleen, it exhibits large and repeated flexions, upwards and down- wards, bending in a circular or fpiral form. Ap- proaching the fubftance of the fpleen, dt divides into many branches, which are equally tortuous; and of thofe that fink into the fpleen, fome fmaller ones return through its fubftance to the diaphragm or ftomach. Its moft remarkable branches are, a. The Great Pancreatic —irregular both in fize and dire&ion. The whole branch is fometimes co- vered by the pancreas; and, palling to the right extremity of this gland, fupplies it with twigs; fending others, at times, to the adjoining duode- num and mefoco'on. If the trunk divides, ano- ther branch, bending to the left, fupplies the place of the tranfnerfe pancreatic. It inofcu- lates with the pylorics and duodenah. h. Small Pancreatics—defcending from the fplenic> in great numbers, through its whole extent. c. Pojlerior Ga/lrics—two or four in number—fome- times wanting—rifing from the middle of the trunk as it paffes to the fpleen, and afcending with the omentum to the polterior furface of the large extremity of the ftomach. d. The Left Gajlro epiploic, or Left Gajlric—of- ten double—rifing near the commencement or ' left extremity of the pancreas, where the trunk begins to divide ; bends downwards, and to the right, with its two branches to the fundus and larger arch of the ftomach ; and, like the right gajlric%

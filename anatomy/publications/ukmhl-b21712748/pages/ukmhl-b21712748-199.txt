The Poferior Fibular—the larged and mod re- gular branch of the' commmon fibular. As it proceeds from its cavity, backwards and out- wards, it begins to defcend ; and, after running behind the external malleolus, to the outer and hollow furface of the os calcis, it inofculates, under the abdu&or of the little toe, before the tuberofity of the os calcis, with fome branches of the external plantar, or fometimes is wholly expended on this abdu&or mufcle and the Ikin, It often gives, <». Branches to the long flexors of the toes and the peronei. A Large Tranfvcrfe Anafomotic Branch—uni- ting, on the periofteum of the tibia, and under the tendons of the gaftrocnemius, and the other mufcles, with the poferior tibia!, and fome branch- es of the anterior filial. Other ramuli are fome- times fent from this branch to the ankle-joint and tendo Achillis; which, uniting with others from the fbu/ar and the external malleolar of the anterior tibia/, reach the outer furface of the os calcis. y. A Branch—fometimes Angle, fometimes double —forming a plexus in the external cavity of the calcaneum, or os calcis, and apaftomofing fre- quently with the anterior tibial branches, S. A Branch— as the artery runs to the external fide of the calcaneum, forming, under the liga- ment that unites the tibia and fibula, a new communication with the poferior tibial, and, by twigs fent outwards, with the external malleolar. i.

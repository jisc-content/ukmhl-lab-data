BRANCHES FftOM THE l6o Seel. 11. at other times is rather fmaller than the pof- terior tibial. After rifing, near the fuperior extremity of the tibialis pojlicus, it defeends between this mufcle and the flexor pollicis. A little lower, it is covered by the flexor pol- licis ; and at lalt efcapes the eye of the diflec- tor between the two bones, where it touches the interofleous ligament. Near the inferior extremity of the bones, where they are more clofely connedted, it divides into the anterior and pojlerior fibular arteries. It gives, a. Branches—pafling through the foleus to the fkin, inofculating with other inferior fibular twigs, and with branches of the pofierior tibial. ■ b. A Branch—penetrating the peroneus longus and the flcin. c. Branches—partly exhaufted on the tibialis and the common flexor of the great toe, and partly fpreading on the periofteum of the fibula. •* d. Many Branches—winding tortuoufly, in various places, under the flexor pollicis and peroneus longus, to the anterior part of the fibula, inof- culating there, upwards and downwards, with twigs from the anterior tibial. e. Many Branches—rifing, in various places, from the defeending trunk, and diftributed to the ti- bialis pollicus, peronei, flexor pollicis, the infe- rior tendon of the foleus and gaftrocnemius, the periofteum, and fkin. Of thefe, fome per- forate the interofleous ligament, and terminate between the anterior mufcles. f. The Nutritious Artery of the Fibula—the lafl of the branches which rife from the trunk before it 1

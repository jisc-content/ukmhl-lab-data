BRANCHES FROM THE Sett. II. 100 right, and more pofterior in its origin, turns, near the kidney, over its concomitant vein ; while the right, which is longer, is covered by its concomitant vein. Approaching the renal depreffion, it divides into two or four branches; which, finking feparately before and behind the pelvis of the kidney, are again divided, and diftribute their fpreadingbranch- es to the papillary cones. Thefe, as they en- circle the convex margin of the papillae, form arches with the adjoining branches, and feem to feparate the cortical from the tubular fubftance. From the convex and concave mar- gin of each arch rife innumerable fmall arte- , ries; of which the former encircle the cortex, and with fome of their branches pafs through its fubftance, and difappear on the fat; while the reft are chiefly difperfed and exhaufted upon the tubular part. Before entering the kidney, the renals give out, A. The Inferior Capfulars. B. Small Phrenics to the crura of the diaphragm. C. Many Adipofe Branches. See below. D. The Superior Ureteric. See below. E. Spermatic Arteries, inofculating fometimes with the fpermatic branches. F. Smaller branches, diftributed to the mefocolon of each fide. VII. The spermatic artery—Right and Left.— This artery is very flender, but, confidering the fmallnefs of its diameter, is the longeft that rifes from the lateral part of the aorta. It

Branches to the abdu&or of the little toe, often terminating the trunk, or fent off, near the union of the trunk, with tht plantar. G, Numerous branches—diftributed, in the courfe of the artery, to the adjoining flexor mufcles, tibialis pollicus, foleus, tendo Achil- lis, nerve, and fkin. H, Transverse branches—often double—anaf- tomofing, as already noticed, with the pofterior fthular. I, A branch—forming a plexus, at the epiphyfis of the tibia and its malleolus, upon the perio- Ileum, with fome fuperior branches of the po~ Jlerior tibial and internal malleolar, and fending fometimes twigs to the capfule of the joint. K. Branches to the flexor tendons and their Iheaths. L. Two large branches—ifluing from the trunk as it runs along the lateral concavity of the heel, at the tuberofity of the calcaneum, fpread- ing out upon its periofleum and aponeurofis, as alfo upon the abductor pollicis and Ikin ; and inofculating with branches of the Jibular. M. A deep branch—palling, under the tendons, to the capfule of the aftragalus and calcaneum, and the bones. N. Another deep branch—running out to the other adjoining bones and their ligaments, and to the articulation of the tibia and aftragalus. L 2 O.

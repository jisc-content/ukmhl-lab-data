I36 BRANCHES FROM THE Sett. II. the interftic-e to the flexors of the thigh. Thus are produced, in the following order, a. Branches to the iliacus internus, pfoas, peftine- us, and capfule. b. Tranfverfe Branches to the peftineus, long and Short adduftor, and gracilis, interwoven every- where, upon their Surface, with branches of the fuperjicial femoral and external circumfex, and more deeply with twigs of the obturator; inos- culating, alfo, with pudic branches by a lefs ob- vious twig, running behind the gracilis to the penis All thefe branches are generally Sent off before the trunk is concealed by the peddineus. c. Many branches, rifing Separately while the trunk paffes under the head of the femur, between the trochanter minor and the acetabulum ; distribu- ted to the heads of the triceps, pedtineus, and capfule, and inofculating frequently with other branches of the deep femoral or profunda. d. The Superior Branch, or Superior Anterior Af- cending—of greater Size, Seemingly one-half of the trunk—runs tranfverfely, between the Short and great adductors, towards the fymphyfis pu- bis, Sometimes disappearing there upon the fkin -7-fends a. A branch through the depreffion in the aceta- bulum to the glands, cartilages, and round liga- ment of the joint. A branch, ramified on the obturator externus. y. Branches, diftributed to the capfule, and in ma- ny place? to the great and Short adduftdrs. t.

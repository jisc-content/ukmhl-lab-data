BRANCHES FROM THE 7° Sea. I. b. Branches proceeding, at various places f*om the trunk, to the radial extenfors, long fupinator, the extenfor of the fingers, the ulnar extenfor, and fkin. Of thefe, the branches refledted to the extenfors inofculate with the highefi pofie- rior interojfeal perforant. e. The Superficial Anafiomotic Branch—inofcula- ting on the furface of the internal brachial with the fmall humeral profunda, and the profunda- radial of the arm, as they wind near the fpine of the condyle, under the fuperior flefhy part of the fupinator and the radial extenfor. d. A branch funk in the internal brachial, and form- ing, round the joint on the capfule and periofte- um, the anterior arch, with the large anaftomo- tic branch of the humerad. e. Branches to the articular ligaments. f. The Deep Anafiomotic Branch—running extern* lively between the long fupinator and the bone, or betwixt the radial extenfor and triceps, to the pofterior furface of the external condyle, where it inofculates "with a branch of the fmall profun- da, and the profunda-radial of the arm. g. Branches fpreading, near the termination of the trunk, on the fkin of the arm. C. Many branches—as the trunk runs fuper- ficially on the pronator rotundus, to the ra- dial extenfors, the two fupinators, the prona- tor rotundus, and radial flexor. Some of thefe ufually inofculate with twigs of the common interojfeal. D. Branches—riling from the artery as it leans on the radius, finking into the fublimis, flex- or of the thumb, radial flexor, and palmaris longus„

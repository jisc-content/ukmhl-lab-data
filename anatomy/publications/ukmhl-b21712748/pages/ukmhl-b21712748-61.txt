There are fometimes fix ciliary arteries, which, whether they arife from the opthalmic or its branches, fpread into fe- veral ramifications, and enter the fclerotic in fuch a manner as naturally to fall under three clafies. 1. Short, or Pofterior Ciliary Branches—arifing from the fuperior and inferior mufcular branches, and from the ethmoidal. They are often thirty in number ; perforating the fclerotic coat, near the optic nerve, while they pafs to the choroid coat, behind. 2. Long Ciliary Branches.—Two in number, en- tering obliquely the pofterior part of the fclero- tic, dividing into two branches as they approach the ciliary circle, and inofculating round the greater circle of the iris. 3. Anterior Ciliary Branches—rifing either from the mufcular, opthalmic itfelf, or the palpebral. They accompany the refti mufcles; and, be- ing divided at a little diftance from the cornea into three or four branches, enter the fclero- tic, and are diftributed among tke long ciliary branches on the uvea. To all thefe, forming a lingular vafcular plexus, the choroid coat, the ciliary circle with its proceffes, and the iris, owe their origin. 3. The Pofterior Ethmoidal Artery—running be- tween the levator and addu&or mufcles, above the greater oblique; enters the pofterior orbi- tary hole ; paffes through the cribriform plate into the cranium ; and, reaching near the dura mater, inofculates with the anterior ethmoidal branches The reft of the trunk is diftributed to the nofe. <*.

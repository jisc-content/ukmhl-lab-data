10 BRANCHES FROM THE Sea. I. oideus, and the tendon of the digaftric. A- fcends, in a tortuous manner, forwards, thro’ the depreffion, for the maxillary gland, and, winding above the maxilla, follows the an- terior margin of the malfeter ;—afterwards branches out, under the zygomatic mufcles, in ferpentine windings, upon the face and the fides of the mouth and nofe. The numerous branches proceeding from this artery art di- vided into two claffes: The firft, compre- hending thofe arteries that leave the trunk before it reaches the maxilla, from i to 6 ; the fecond, the branches diftributed on the face itfelf, from 7 to 12. j. The Afcending Palatine—covered by the ftyloid mufcles—lies upon the fides of the pharynx, near the external margin of the internal ptery- goid mufcle. Twigs being fent from it to thefe mufcles, to the tongue, the tonfils, and the Eu- ftachian tube, it is divided, near the fides of the levator palati, into * A Superficial Palatine Branch—following the courfe of the circumflex mufcle of the palate, and diftributing twigs to the pendulous velum and its glands. * * A Deep Palatine Branch—perforating the ve- lum under the levator palati, and copioufly fup- plying with branches the uvula, palate bone, tonfils, and tendinous expanfion of the circum- flex. 2. Minuter branches to the ftylohyoideus, the fty- lopharyngeus, the hyoglofl'us, and glands. 3. The Tonfillar Branch—fometimes wanting— near \

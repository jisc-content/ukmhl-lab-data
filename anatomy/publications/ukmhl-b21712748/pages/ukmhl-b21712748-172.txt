BRANCHES FROM THE Sell. II. From the Afcending Branch of the divided trunk proceed, * A branch, communicating, behind the quadratus and gemelli, with the deep branch of the ifchiadic, and with a twig of the common pudic, that runs down beyond the gemelli. This laft one the illuftrious Haller confiders as a trunk, and gives it the name of fupcrfcial; but regards the other as a branch of this fuperfcial, and denominates it the pojlerior trochanteric. * * Branches, inofculating, in the trochante- ric foffa, with the anterior trochanteric and the profundijftma of the pojlerior iliac. From the Defending Branch proceeds, + A confiderable ramulus, receiving a twig from the frjl perforant, above the higher part of the adduftor, near the root of the trochanter. 2. The Internal Branch, or Inferior Internal—gene- rally larger than the former—rifes, near the tube- rofity of the ifchium, between the quadratus and adduftor; and, palling through the adipofe fub- fiance, which is here fo largely accumulated, runs to the common origin of the flexors of the thigh. It here fpreads into numerous ramifica- tions, diftributed, partly to the tuberofity itfelf, where inofculations are formed by the branches of the ifchiadic, obturator, and pudic ; partly tq the flexors, but chiefly to the great adduftor. D. The first perforant—running backwards from the trunk, below the fmall trochanter ; and between the peftineus and fhort adduftor, or between its fibres, proceeds, near the vaf- tus internus, in fuch a manner as to pafs o- bliquely

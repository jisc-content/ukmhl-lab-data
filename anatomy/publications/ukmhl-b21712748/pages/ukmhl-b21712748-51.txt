ARCH OF THE AORTA, 19 s<a. l and behind it, forming, as it were, a continua- tion of the trunk—is distributed, in numerous ramifications, to the occipital and lateral parts of the head ; inofculates with the occipital a- bout the lambdoidal future, with the temporo- frontal before, and above with the branches ftretching from the oppofite fide. ■ 2V. B. The Temporal Artery gives many minute branches to the pericranium, and the bone. H. Internal maxillary.—This artery is lar- ger than the temporal: It rifes above the la- teral ligament of the maxilla, about the middle of the ramus of the inferior maxillary bone, before the external pterygoid; and, bending inwards, forwards, and downwards, is concealed under the maxilla. It then rifes obliquely upwards and forwards, to the fpace lying between the tuber maxillare and the pterygoid procefs; and as it proceeds in a tor- tuous manner, it is loft here in three or four branches, or rather in the fpheno-maxillary fiflure. In this courfe it gives 1. The Deep Auricular Artery—going to the poste- rior part of the meatus auditorius, and giving twigs to this and the neighbouring glands. It is fometimes wanting. 2. The Artery of the Tympanum—which, having fent ramuli to the fat of the maxillary articu- lation, pafles through the fiffure of GlaSTerus to the anterior mufcle of the malleus. 3. The Small Meningeal Artery—running towards the bafis of the Skull, parallel to the middle B 2 meningeal.

SO BRANCHES FROM THE Sett. II. phageal, or afcending coronary branch of the cceliac and the phrenic arteries. VII. The INFERIOR, or AORTIC intercostals— from eight to ten in number—rife from the pofterior and lateral fades of the trunk, and, bending to the interfaces of the ribs, run along their inferior margins. As the branch- es of the right fide mud pafs over the bo- dies of the vertebrae, they are longer than thofe of the left. The four or fix fuperior ones are fmaller, and afcend a little; while the inferior proceed tranfverfely. The firjl fuperior, rifing at the fourth vertebra, and running in the third or fourth coftal inter- lace, inofculates with the fuperior intercoflal of the fubclavian. The lalt, rifing behind the crura of the diaphragm, paffes over the quadratus lumborum ; and, following the margin of the laftc rib, is difiributed to the aponeurofis of the tranfverfe mufcle of the abdomen. They all fend, A. Three Branches—running, near the heads of the ribs, to the fpina! cavity : the firjl entering the bone ; the fecond, the dura mater; and the third, where the coftal nerve comes out, enter- ing the fpinal marrow. B. Deep Dorfo-mufcular Branches —fent to the dor- fal mufcles; and forming a plexus on the back. N. B. The preceding twigs forrtetimes unite into one trunk. C. A number of branches to the intercoftal mufcles; and, after penetrating thefe, diftributed to the ferratus

Sett. IT. DESCENDING AORTA. I07 firft generally inofculatcs with the laft lumbar ami ileo-lumbar. 1. A branch, riling to the re&um, fo large as at times to fupply the place of the hcemorrbvidalf and reach to the bladder. c. Branches font, in a radiated form, from the fmall arch, and diftributed to the neighbouring muf- fles and membranes. (I.) The internal iliac, or hypogastric. Five times larger in the foetus than the external; but, after a year, only equal in fize; for while the umbilical continues pervious, exhaufting al- mod the whole blood of the trunk, it feems con- tinued into this artery, forming an arch that is convex downwards, and from whofe circumfe- rence the other fmall arteries of the pelvis are fent off. About to pafs the brim of the pelvis, behind the peritoneum, it lies, with a more ob- tufe angle, in the middle, between the ileum and facrum ; thence bending gradually downwards, between the pelvis and its vifeera. When the um- bilical artery decays, the trunk diftributes its nu- merous branches in fo various dire&ions, that none of them feem to follow its courfe, or to re- prefent its continuation. As the common pudic and ifchiadic, however, are the lowed, and thofe which run mod dired'tly downwards, they have generally been confidered by anatomids as the terminating branches. Its branches, though condant,

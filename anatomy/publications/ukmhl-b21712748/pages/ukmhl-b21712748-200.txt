BRANCHES FROM TIIE Seel. II. K. Branches—reaching, in the finuofity of the os calcis, to the fore part of this bone, and inofeu* lating with fimilar branches of the pojlerior ti- bia!' (fee L), at the fame time giving out others, thinly ramified on the bone, and terminating, by many minute twigs, on the fat and lkin. ». Branches to the abduftor of the little toe, en- tering, like the terminating trunk, into a re- markable, and almott conftant, inofculation with the external plantar. h. The interior Fibular—often wanting—when prefent, pafles through the interftice of the cru- ral bones, running, downwards and forwards, in the angle between the extremities of the tibia and fibula, behind the extenfor pollicis and the fliort peroneus, where it inofculates with the external malleolar ; and then proceeding, under the tendon of the peroneus, to the os cuboides, where it lies concealed between this bone and the abduftor mufcle, inofculates partly with the external plantar, and partly terminates on the lkin. From this arife, a. A Branch—running upwards to the fibula and periofteum of the tibia. p.‘ Branches—interwoven, in the neighbourhood of the external malleolus and peroneal tendons, with the former artery. y. A Tranfverfe Annjlomotic Branch — forming, be- hind the extenfors, and on the periofteum, a re- markable inofculation with the anterior tibial% fending alfo twigs to the capfule and tendons, j. A Branch —finking into the capfule of the joint, after inofculating with various metatarfal branches, i. Many Branches— fcattered among the ligamen- tous fheaths of the peroneal mufcles, and inof- culating, in many places, at the exterior fide of the calcaneum, with the pofieriorfibular. S. Branche,

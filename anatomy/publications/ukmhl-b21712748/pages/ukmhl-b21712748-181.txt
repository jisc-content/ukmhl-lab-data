St Cl. II. DESCENDING AORTA. 14^ duclor, to the flexors of the thigh—Sending off, in this courfe, a. Branches to the adjacent mufcles. b. A Perforating Branch—which, foon ramifying, inofculates in the fubftance, or on the furface of the flexors, with afcending and defcending twigs, but chiefly on the long head of the bi- ceps with defcending branches of the fecondper- forant, and with afcending branches of the infe- rior perforant. N. B. The perforating branch of this and the fol- lowing artery is fometimes wanting; and the trunk is infle&ed under the biceps only to the vaftus externus, where it pafles into many branches, inofculating varioufly with the neigh- bouring articular artery. D. The inferior perforant—ifluing a little be- low the laft, from the external margin of the trunk ; running tranfverfely, under the adduc- tor magnus, at the pofterior furface of the fe- mur, to the fhort head of the biceps, and un- der that to the mufcular fubftance of the vaf- tus externus. It fometimes extends to the cruralis, and is often double. It gives a. Minute branches to the adjacent mufcles. b. The Inferior Nutritious Branch—fent upwards from the trunk as it pafles under the fhort head of the biceps ; inofculating, on the femur, near the linea afpera, with the fuperior nutritious branch, and diftributing its laft ramuli in the fubftance of the bone. It is fometimes fent off from the former perforant. c. A Perforating Branch—running, in the hollow K of

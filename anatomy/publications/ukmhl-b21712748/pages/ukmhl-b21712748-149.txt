Branches—fometimes wanting—diltributed, af- ter perforating the quadratus, to the higher ex- tremity of the femitendinofus, biceps, femimem- branofu3, and furface of the tuberofity of the ifchium. g. The Internal Branch—running firft backwards, under the obturator externus to the inner mar- gin of the foramen, and inofculating, by its ex- treme branches beyond that mufcle, with the branches of the internal circumflex. From this g° a. Blanches to the obturator mufcles. P. A branch, extending beyond the obturator, a- bove the adduftor brevis, to the gracilis and fym- phyfis pubis, and difappearing upon the (kin of the genitals. This branch inofculates with thofe of the pudic. V. Branches, diltributed to the capfule, long ad- ductor, and quadratus, after the artery has pair- ed the obturator, and inofculating, on the tri- ceps, with the internal circumflex. $. A branch, forming a coronary arch with the ex- ternal branch at the tuberofity of the ifchium. From this are font twigs to the adduCtor mag- nus and biceps, anaflomofing with the common pudic. 'I he remaining trunk, which here runs into the circumflex, is fent to the quadratus and the heads of the adduCtor. But this artery is throughout very irregular. H. The "posterior iliac, or gluteal—the lar- geft of all the arteries, ilTuing from the hypo- gaflric. It rifes early from the back part of the trunk, below the Jaero- late mis and obtu- H 2 rator ;

BRANCHES FROM THE g4 Seel. II. pofterior furface of the liver, and its fufpenfory ligament; inofculating, in many places, with the hepatic arteries. Upon the left, they run to the left lobe of the liver, the ligament of the fpleen, the cefophagus, and cardia. N. B. The diaphragm fometimes receives wander- ing branches from the cceliac, inferior interco- Jlals, the capfulars, and the lumbars, particular- ly from the fecond lumbar. II. The coeliac artery—Ihort, but of large diameter—riling between the crura of the diaphragm, above the eleventh dorfal verte- bra, from the anterior part of the aorta, and at the fuperior margin of the pancreas, be- tween the papillary lobule, or lobule of Spi- gelius, and the left fide of the lefier arch of the ftomach. It then defeends, in a tortu- ous manner, forwards and to the right, and, running about the third of an inch, ultimate- ly feparates into three branches, in fuch a manner, that the two on the right feem to arife from a common bafe; while the left is more diftindt at its origin. Thefe are, A. The Superior Coronary, or Great Left Gaftric, or Superior or Left Gafiro-hepatic—fmaller than the other branches, if refledted only to the fto- mach ; but almoft equal in fize to the fplenic, if, as fometimes happens, it fends a branch alfo to the liver. It appears fometimes to iffue from the fplenic ; afeends to the left, and forwards to the cardia and lelFer arch of the ftomach ; then bending downwards, and to the right, reaches the margin of the ftomach, where it diftributes extenfively

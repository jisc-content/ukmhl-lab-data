The dorso carpal—iflues from the trunk, near the tendons of the radial, and proceeds tranfverfely above the carpus, and under the tendons of the extenfors, to the ulnar fide of the wrift, where it forms an extenfrve plexus w’ith the branches of the dorfo-interojfeal, and completes the dorfo carpal arch with the dor- fal of the hand : At the fame time lends off a. The Firjl Metacarpal, or Dorfo-interojfeal *— defeending beyond the carpus, upon the furface of the firft interofleous mufcle, between the fore and middle fingers; and inofculates with the third vola-digital at its bifurcation. In which courfe it gives + Branches communicating, in two places, with the fuperior perferant. + + Branches, diftributed to the interofleous muf. cles, the joint, and extenfors of the index. b.

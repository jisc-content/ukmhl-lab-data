21 THANSACTIONS OF SECTIOX H. Thft higher we ascend in the scale of humanity, the more perfect does this control become, and the more do the instincts, emotions, passions and appetites become subordinated to the self-conscious principle which regulates our judgments and beliefs. It will therefore now be a matter for scientific inquiry to determine, as far as the anatomical conditions will permit, the proportion which the associa- tion centres bear to the other centres both in mammals and in man, the period of development of the association fibres, in comparison with that of the motor and sensory fibres in difiâ€™erent animals, and, if possible, to obtain a comparison in these respects between the brains of savages and those of men of a high order of intelligence. The capability of erecting the trunk ; the power of extending and fixing the hip and knee joints when standing; the stability of the foot; the range and variety of movement of the joints of the upper limb; the balancing of the head on the summit of the spine; the mass and weight of the brain, and the perfection of its internal mechanism, are distinctively human characters. They are the factors concerned in adapting the body of man, under the guidance of reason, intelligence, the sense of responsibdity and power of self-control, for the discharge of varied and important duties in relation to himself, his Maker, his fellows, the animal world and the earth on which he lives. riUNTEt) sir SFOTTIEWOODE AND CO., NEW-STEKET SQUARE LONDON

469 MOTION. equal length, equally extended, and represented at the moment when the previously swinging leg is placed on the ground; but Jig. 260, which is walking slowly, has the leg advanced far beyond the vertical. Fig. 259, which is walking quicker, has the leg less advanced, whilst fig. 258, which represents the greatest possible celerity, lias the foot placed directly in the vertical line, passing through the head of the femur. We observe also that of the paths described by the swinging leg of the three figures, that of Jig. 260 has nearly completed the entire curve, that of Jig. 259 a little more than half, and that of Jig. 258 exactly half the curve; and that the dotted line which serves to indicate the path of the leg is least in Jig. 260, greater in Jig. 259, and greatest in fig. 258. The time is greatest in fig. 260, less in fig. 259, and least in Jig. 258; conse- quently, when the leg swings beyond the Fig. 257.

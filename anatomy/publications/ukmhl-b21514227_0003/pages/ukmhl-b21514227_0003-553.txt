MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 531 regards their means of relation with the external world. Having as yet no ganglia developed sufficiently important, from their size or situa- tion, to merit the title of brains, or lit to be regarded as constituting a common sensorium, whereunto information derived from remote parts of the body may be conveyed, localized instruments of sensation would be as yet super- fluous, and consequently, with the exception of the generally diffused sense of touch which, from its extreme delicacy, seems in these lowest forms of existence to supply to a certain extent the deficiency of other means of perception, instruments of sensation are riot as yet conferred. The presence of a localized organ of sense, analogous to an eye or an ear, must obviously be useless to a creature pos- sessed of no sensorial centre, to which informa- tion, derived through the medium of that sense, may be transmitted, and organs of the higher senses are, therefore, as yet entirely wanting throughout the Nematoneurose division of the animal kingdom,* as, a fortiori, they are necessarily deficient throughout the Aciute classes. In like manner the existence of external locomotive members, moved by any powerful or elaborately constructed muscular apparatus, is not to be expected in animals that possess not ganglia capable of presiding over voluntary muscular motion. Limbs, there- fore, properly so called, are not as yet de- veloped; and, if in some of the most perfect Epizoa, the rudiments of such structures be- come apparent, it is only because the animals possessing them are so nearly allied to the Articulata, in their general structure, that the nervous ganglia in them are beginning to be developed, and thus they can only be looked upon as the transition steps leading by an almost imperceptible gradation from one great type of animal organism to another of a more elevated character. In the Articulata (Homocangljata, Owen), brains, or ruling ganglionic centres, for the first time make their appearance in a suffi- cient state of development to correspond with organs of sense of a localized character, or to animate systems of muscles adapted to wield locomotive limbs, and combine complex ac- tions now essentially connected with the more perfect attributes bestowed on forms of life capable of more extensive relations with sur- rounding objects. Still, however, an exact correspondence exists between the progressive expansion of the nervous centres and the gradual * In laying this down as an important physiolo- gical axiom, a few words of explanation will he required by those, who, adopting Ehrenberg's views, regard the red spots observable upon nume- rous Animalcules and Zoophytes as being the eyes of those creatures. That many species of such animals possess red spots occupying dennite posi- tions upon different parts ot their bodies, no one will be disposed to deny who has paid the slightest attention to their economy and organization ; but that these red spots are eyes, we think, for the reasons above stated, may reasonably be doubted, more especially as it has not even been proved by observation or experiment that they possess either the structure, or the functions of any visual appa- ratus, with which we are acquainted. appearance of limbs moved by a distinct mus- cular apparatus, which become progressively superadded to the annulose body or trunk of the articulated animal, and in precisely the same manner does the advancement of the nervous system from a less perfect to a more concentrated condition evrdently precede the appearance of external appendages, subservient to the exercise of more exalted powers of sen- sation, or increased capabilities of locomotion. The humblestaunulose forms, as for example the Leech and the Earthworm, possessing, as they do, a nervous system consisting of an extended series of numerous pairs of feeble ganglin, none of which are as yet sufficiently potent to con- trol any complex muscular apparatus, or to appreciate impressions derived from without with much nicety or precision,are necessarily deprived of outward limbs, or complicated instruments of sense; their soft and flexible integument is unequal to sustain any jointed members what- ever, and the first rude vestiges of simple eyes, ocelli, are all that can be allowed for the pur- poses of vision. By degrees the nervous gan- glia becoming fewer in number as they coalesce into larger and proportionately more energetic masses, the moving organs of the body become perfected in the same ratio; limbs, almost impotent as yet, but still sketching out the arti- culated legs hereafter to be perfected, make their appearance, and the apodous Annelidan, the humble inhabitant of the water, is promoted to a terrestrial existence ; jointed feet at length become appended to the segments of the still worm-like body, small and feeble at first, as in the lulus terrestris and the other vegetable- eating Myriapods, but speedily, in proportion as the individual segments of the body become enlarged and strengthened, and the motor gan- glia acquire increased energy, assuming larger dimensions and greater perfection of structure, until the annulose animal attains the strength and activity of the carnivorous Scolopendra, and becomes fitted for a life of rapine and destruction. Advancing from the Scolopendra, which as yet is only able to creep upon the surface of the ground, we are at length conducted to the far more active and highly gifted races of Insects, properly so called, in which the de- velopment and perfection of the muscular sys- tem is advanced to a condition adapting these wonderful little beings to an aerial existence, and in making the transition from Myriapod to the Insect the carrying out of the same great law is most obviously and conspicuously illustrated. The nervous ganglia, still nume- rous and proportionately feeble even in the Scolopendra, become in the aerial insect reduced in number until they are collected into a few large and potent masses ; senses of a wonder- fully exalted description, correspondent with the increased size of the encephalic ganglia, replace the simpler organs of the less exalted Articulata ; those segments of the body where- unto locomotive members are appended coalesce and become fused together into a dtnse and strong thoracic armour able to sustain the vio- lent efforts of the powerful muscles now re- 2 m 2

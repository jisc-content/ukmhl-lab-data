During the depression of the uing the bird is drawn downwards by the force W, arising from its own u2 weight, and by the resistance of the air to its rising, namely, it k s —i but it is driven upwards by the resistance which the air opposes to the motion of the wing, that is, it K A £Y — , hence the equation to the motion will be W du v .

The motion of the wing being very quick, we may consider u to be constant during a depression, and if u0, ul be the values of u, at the beginning and end of the depression, equation (12) will become 2 W (wj—«0) = t { tt KA (V—a0) 2— it ks a2 — 2 W g} (13) Similarly if vv a2be the values of Mat the beginning and end of an elevation, the equation for the motion will be 2 W(a2 — m,)=— t'{wK'A'(V + u1)2+7rfcsttf + 2 Wg-} (14) By adding the two latter equations together we have 2W(ttg—w0)=t{wKA(V—a„)2—Wfcsa2-2Wg}_T'{7rK'A'(V'+a1)2+T/c««2+2Wff} (15) Since, at the end of every flapping the wings are supposed to be in the same position as they were at the beginning of it, we must have Vt = V't' (16) The two equations (15) and (16) express the conditions under which the bird may acquire a given motion, the nature of which is shown by the variation a2 — a0 which the velocity a undergoes in the time t + t'.

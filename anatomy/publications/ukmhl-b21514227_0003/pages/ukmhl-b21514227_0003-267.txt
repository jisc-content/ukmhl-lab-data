The ligamenta suspensoria may be seen passing from the anterior surface of the gland to the skin, supporting the folds or processes of the former, and leaving considerable cavities between them, in which the fat is contained in its proper membrane. The fascia may be observed passing to each extremity of the gland and dividing into two portions; the anterior proceeding upon the surface of the gland to form the ligamenta susjjensoria; the posterior behind the gland, sending processes between which a smaller quantity of fat is contained; and both these layers assist in producing the fibrous tissue of the gland. It also sends processes of fascia backwards to join the aponeurosis of the pectoral muscle, b, b, forming the line from one extremity of the gland to the other.

MOTION. 417 will be drawn to P. In this case the contrac- tile force is more than sufficient for the object to be attained. All other things remaining the same, the space C P will be greatest when the obliquity is that which is stated in the proposition. If A P = I A C, the £, A C P is 48° 35' nearly. From the researches of the Professors Weber we learn that the weight of the extensor muscles generally predominates over that of the flexors; those of the leg being selected, their propor- tions in two well-formed healthy subjects were found to be as ('2403.2 +_2^H) : 810.3 jl. 10211 __ 2913.75 :1320.85,* or as 11 T 2 to 5 in favour of the extensors, the proportions are divided by 2, or halved, to allow for the double office which some muscles perform of both flexion and extension, according as either end becomes the fixed point. The pre- ponderance of the weight of the extensors be- comes greater if the double action of each be omitted in the computation and the whole weight of each set be substituted; the pro- portion then becomes, 2403.2 : 810 3, or as 3 to 1 nearly. The weight of the extensor muscles, when compared with that of the rest of the leg, is in the proportion of 5 to 9, and to the whole of the muscles, including the flexors, as 3 to 4, consequently the extensor muscles of the leg weigh three-fourths of the whole series. Borelli has given approximate values for the powers of a great number of the muscles of the human body, from which we select a few computations which will convey an idea of the enormous amount of their absolute power and the large proportion of it which is sacri- ficed in order to gain velocity. Borelli states that the whole force expended by the muscles of the arms, when stretched horizontally, is 209 times greater than that of any weight sus- pended at its extremity, and that the force of the biceps to that of the brachialis is as 3 to 2.6, or as 15 to 13, and their absolute forces as 300 to 260. He estimates the force of the deltoid at 61600 pounds, the sum of the forces of the intercostal muscles at 32040 pounds, and of the glutaei at 375420 pounds. The extensor muscles of the hip, knee, and ankle-joints have also a large proportion of their power sacrificed to velocity; the amount of this inter- change has been estimated upon the following principles of Borelli. Let us suppose a porter carrying a weight to be in the act of stooping in order to enter a door- way with his load; his body is bent, with one leg raised from the ground, and the heel of the * 2403.2 = the weight of the muscles in grammest acting over one joint of the leg, viz. the gluta?i =: 936.0, vasti and cruralis = 1092.0, so- leus = 375.2, and 1021.1 = the weight of those flexors and extensors of the leg acting over two joints, viz the rectus = 199.2, semitendinosus = 128.2, semimembranosus = 206.5, biceps = 129, gastrocnemius 358. i A grain =: 0.067508 gramme, VOL. in.

Then if the weight r = 120lb., the weight of the porter 1501b., the line r s be the direc- tion of the force of gravity cutting the femur and tibia in c and x, the centre of gravity of the man be at b, and the common centre of gravity of the man and his load be at a, then the weight of the man from the head to b will be = >™lb. s= 75lb., and of the section b to c, by supposition, is =■ 47, therefore the weight of the arc a b c = 75 +■ 47 = 122, also by supposition the section c v x = 20, and consequently the whole arc a b v if == 142, also the distances of the directions of the muscles from the axes of the joints to the dis- tances of the line of gravity are, according to Borelli, in the following ratio: \ the distance f b is to the distance m b as 1 is to 8; \ o v is to t v as 1 to 6; \ k d is to p d as 1 to 3; and t v to b m as 3 to A; hence we derive these proportions: — t v : b m : : r -{- a b v x : z, or 3 : 4 : : 120 + 122 : 322^1b. = the pressure of the weight of man and load at tire point s. a p ; b m : : r + a b v d f: s, or 3 : 8 : : 120 + 150 : 720 = the force of the whole weight at s.

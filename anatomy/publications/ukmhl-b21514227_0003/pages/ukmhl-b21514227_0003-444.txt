MOTION. 422 of the under wing 0.65; the sum of the areas of the two wings consequently is —1.25 ; but when placed in the position of flight, as the anterior wing lies partially over the under wing, the whole effective surface of the two wings measures 0.83, and that of the four 1.66 in. During repose the dorsal planes of the wings of the diurnal Lepidoptera are directed verti- cally and brought into contact. Nocturnal Lepidoptera.—Many of this order have large organs of flight; their wings, which in repose lie in or beneath the horizontal plane, are triangular, their apices being the most dis- tant points from the body when the wings are extended, and their areas are in the inverse ratio of their velocities, and their distances from the centre of gravity. Thus in the Erebus Strix (Jig. 221) the wings are greatly expanded and of a form the best calculated for rapid flight, the areas of the sections of the wing being, for the most part, in the inverse ratio of their distances from the axis of motion; consequently the reverse of that of the Pontia, the Morpho, and most of the diurnal Lepidoptera. The anterior wing is much larger than the posterior, being as 7.175 to 5.095 square inches. The area of the four wings is therefore about 12.270 inches, which, being very considerable in proportion

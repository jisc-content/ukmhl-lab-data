The time occupied in running between the raising of the leg from the ground and the setting it down again is equal to the duration of the step, together with the portion of time during which the body swings in the air; or, it is the time in which c (Jig. 262) advances from c2 to c5, being the time between the raising of the left leg and the setting it down again, but this time is divided into two por- tions, namely, that whilst c Fie. 262.

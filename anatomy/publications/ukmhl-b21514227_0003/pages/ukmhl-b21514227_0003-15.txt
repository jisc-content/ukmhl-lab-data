INSTINCT. 3 tween the constitution of the mind of man and of that of the dumb animals. But it has nevertheless been Ions; observed, that while animals are thus incapable of com- prehending the importance or devising means for the attainment of objects which we perceive to be within their reach, and clearly and imme- diately important to them, they habitually per- form many actions which are admirably adapted to the attainment of certain ends, and these often remote and obscure, and known to us only by means of repeated observation and re- flection, and strictly inductive reasoning. No animals, for example, are capable of such ob- servation and comprehension of the laws of nature, as to procure for themselves at pleasure artificial heat or regular and uniform supplies of food ; but many are seen to form nests or burrows, and lay up magazines of provisions, early in the autumn, which are to protect them against cold and famine during the winter; while others, even while the temperature is still mild, undertake long and painful aerial voy- ages, whereby they escape from the rigours of a northern climate, and enjoy the warmth and abundance of the tropical regions. Such pro- visions for future contingencies are within the power of man, but in him they are clearly de- pendent on the power of forming and applying general notions ; and if the lower animals pos- sessed that power, we can see nothing to hinder their enjoying the use of language, and might confidently expect to see many indications of varied contrivance for their own immediate convenience, which never present themselves to any observer of their habits. The utter ab- sence of intelligence in the other actions of animals, corresponding to that which ap- pears manifestly to regulate certain actions which accomplish certain definite purposes, is our first reason for believing that, while nature has vouchsafed to man alone the enjoyment of what we call Reason,—the power of compre- hending her laws, and so adapting means to ends as to turn these laws to his own advan- tage,—she has provided for the maintenance of other animals, not only by the circumstances in which she has placed them in the world, but also by imparting to them, on certain occasions, a peculiar mental impulse, urging them to the performance of certain actions which are useful to themselves or to their kind, but the use of which they do not themselves perceive, and their performance of which is a necessary con- sequence of their being placed in certain cir- cumstances, and often, more particularly, of their feeling certain sensations. And this is the general notion which we attach to the term Instinct. The term, it must be remembered, stands in opposition, not to the will, but to the reason of man. The most correct expression of the difference between an action prompted by in- stinct and one prompted by reason is, that in the first case the will acts in obedience to an impulse which is directly consequent on certain sensations or emotions, felt or re- membered ; in the last it acts in obedience to an impulse which results from acts of reasoning and imagination. It is incorrect to say, that all the actions of animals differ from those of man in being performed without anticipation of their effects. Many of the most familiar actions of animals are guided by a perfectly correct anticipation of their conse- quences, (otherwise they would not be suscep- tible of training); but it is such an anticipation as implies the exercise only of the faculty of memory. The term Reason is properly applied to the anticipation of those consequences of actions, of which we can be informed only by processes of reasoning and imagination, im- plying the exercise of the faculty of abstraction, and the formation of general notions or ideas. In some instances, the instinctive impulse, consequent on a particular sensation or suc- cession of sensations beinj; felt, acts im- mediately on certain nerves and muscles; and no experience is necessary, in order that the action required, although a complex and dif- ficult one, may be performed with perfect pre- cision, as in the case of the winking of the eye, or shrinking of the arm from injury, or of suction and deglutition following certain im- pressions on the mouth and throat. These actions seem to be very nearly if not precisely on the same footing as those which have been described by Whvtt and others as the natural effects of sensation, and by Dr. Marshall Hall as indications of what he terms the reflex func- tion of the spinal cord,—such as the actions of breathing, coughing, sneezing, vomiting, &c. ; and in which the intervention of sensation, al- though strongly indicated, is not universally admitted. But in the greater number of cases, the in- stinctive determination appears to act not di- rectly on the nerves and muscles, but on the train of mental changes which serves as the motive to the exertion of the will; it extends to a long succession of actions, performed by individuals or by societies, each of which takes place under the influence of a mental deter- mination of a permanent character, and is often effected by a succession of voluntary efforts, which may require some habit and experience in order that they may be performed with pre- cision. Thus many animals require some length of experience before they acquire the use of their limbs or of their wings; but having acquired that power, they are taught by instinct to use them for the purpose of flight immediately on feeling certain sensations and emotions. In all such cases the actions are strictly voluntary, although the will acts, as we believe, in obedience to instinct, not to reason; and this seems to be the proper view to be taken of such long-continued and ad- mirably combined actions as we see in the for- mation of the nests of birds, or of the houses of beavers, or in other instances to be afterwards mentioned. The sensations of these animals, at particular seasons, excite a variety of mental operations, but these operations are all con- trolled and directed by the desire or propensity to the performance of certain definite actions, whether by the individual alone or in concert with others.

The animal presents many points of resemblance to Patella, and there is essentially the same arrangement of its nervous system. The absence of ganglia on the upper part of the ring (i) is attributed by Mr. Gar- ner to the want of eyes and of tentacles.

In Scyllaa, according to Mr. Garner, the brain is entirely supra-cesophageal; it appears to be composed of four united ganglia, pro- bably the cerebral and branchial. The foot has become too insignificant to require appropriate ganglia. Mr. Garner has noticed two minute black spots, one on each side of the brain, composed probably of black pigment, which he considers to be rudimentary of eyes. Nervous system of Scyllcea Pelagica.

In Limax ater (common slug) the nervous system is apparently much more simple; but on a little examination it will be found to con- sist of the same essential parts. A large supra- cesophageal ganglion, bilobed, constitutes the brain {a, fig. 343), from each side of which a pair of nerves passes downwards to join a large sub- cesophageal ganglion, which supplies nerves to the respiratory sac and to the foot or loco- motive apparatus. And the pharyngeal ganglia are, as in Patella, con- nected with the anterior ganglion. In the sub- cesophageal ganglion we see, conjoined, the pedal and branchial ganglia. In Buccinum unda- tum the principal ner- vous mass is sub-ceso- phageal, and from it nerves pass to the bran- chiae and viscera, and also to the foot and integument.

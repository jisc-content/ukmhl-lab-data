INSTINCT. 24 whether the reflex function of Dr. Mar- shall Hall, on which respiration, degluti- tion, the evacuation of the bowels and blad- der, &c. depend, is to be regarded as the re- sult of a merely physical impression on the nerves and spinal cord, like the impression of blood on the heart; or whether the sensations which naturally accompany these actions are, in the natural state, part of the cause which excites them. But that even when the volun- tary powers of animals are certainly the means employed for the ends of their creation, they are still very generally guided by the superior intelligence which has framed both their phy- sical and mental constitution, and which rules the mental but instinctive efforts consequent on the sensations that are felt, as surely as the laws of muscular contraction rule the move- ments of the heart; and it is into the hands of man alone that the reins of voluntary power are absolutely resigned. And when we thus pass in review the sen- sorial and voluntary powers of animals, we are naturally led to the question, whether there is really in our own case so great an exception to those laws of nature which regulate all the other members of the animal creation; whe- ther, admitting the essential superiority of the intellect or reason of man, the different desires and motives to action, which are implanted in him, are not equally subject to the control of the power that gives them, and whether their consequences are not as exactly ruled by laws and as fully anticipated, as those of the in- stincts of animals. Without entering fully on this abstruse ques- tion, we would take the liberty of remarking, in the view of placing it in its simplest form before our readers, that as the intimations of our own consciousness are the ultimate foun- dation of all the knowledge that we have or can have of our own minds, and as certain of the intuitive principles of belief which our minds naturally suggest to us must be trusted, if we are to inquire into the subject at all; so the only question that can be reasonably proposed on this point is, whether there is any good reason for suspecting that the belief of our own free-will, which naturally attends cer- tain of the operations of our minds, is a de- ception; and that the analogy of other ani- mals is only applicable to the subject in so far as it can throw light on that question. Now, we find that the works of man, which we ascribe to his reason, and in the execution of which the consciousness of his free-will intervenes, are essentially different from those which we ascribe to the blind instincts of ani- mals, in the total absence (already noticed) of that uniformity which is so leading a charac- teristic of the effects of the latter; and we may reasonably assert that this is just the difference to be expected between the works of man and of other animals, on the supposition that the power concerned in the former is not subject to the direct influence and control of that higher intellect, by which the laws and limits of that concerned in the latter are irrevocably set; and therefore, that there exists no such analogy between the works of man and of other animals as need induce us to suspect, that the evidence of his consciousness on the point in question is not to be trusted. At the same time it ought to be observed, and perhaps has not been duly remarked, not only that the desires which are the principal motives to human action, are analogous to, sometimes identical with, the instincts of ani- mals, (many of them having been evidently given him with the same intention, and with a clear perception of their general result on his condition,)—but also that the constitution of the human mind appears from the intimations of our own consciousness to be such, as to allow of interposition of a superior power, controlling in a certain degree the will of man, without making itself obvious to his mind. For it is admitted by the soundest metaphy- sicians, that the only truly voluntary power which we are conscious of possessing over the train of thought in our minds, and therefore ultimately over many of our actions, operates only indirectly.* We have no power of de- termining the thoughts that succeed one ano- ther or regulating the order of their succes- sion ; and although various laws of association have been laid down, by which many of the component parts of the train appear to be con- nected, yet it will hardly appear to any one who reflects on the operations of his mind, that all the thoughts which succeed one ano- ther can be ascertained to have such bonds of connection with one another. At all events, the only strictly voluntary power which we are conscious that we possess, is that of singling out and detaining any particular portion of the train, whereby it may be made to predominate in the mind, and to produce practical results which might not otherwise have followed; and even this kind of influence over the train of thought is not exercised exclusively by volition, but is produced in a great measure also by other causes, physical and moral. Now if this be so, how can we deny the possibility of a superior intelligence retaining a power of con- trolling the acts of any individual human mind, or of any number of minds, either by suggest- ing particular thoughts, or by causing the mind to dwell upon particular thoughts in preference to others, without its sense of its own volun- tary power being interrupted or withdrawn,— nay, without the spontaneous voluntary power being really suspended, the only difference being in the degree of influence which it exerts over the train of thought and consequent vo- litions ? It has been said that the expression in Pope's Universal Prayer— * " So completely is the current of thoughts in the mind," says Stewart, " subjected to physical laws, that it has been justly observed by Lord Kames that we cannot, by an effort of our will, call up any one thought, and that the train of our ideas depends on causes which operate in a man- ner inexplicable by us. This observation, although it has been censured as paradoxical, is almost self- evident ; for to call up any particular thought sup- poses it to be already in the mind."—Elements, Sfc. ch. v. sect. 3.

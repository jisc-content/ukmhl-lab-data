534 MUSCULAR SYSTEM. Professor Ehrenberg has more recently an- nounced that he had detected a nervous fila- ment encircling the margin of the disc in one of the pulmonigrade Acalephae, and connecting the red spots, which he is pleased, as we think without sufficient reason, to call eyes, with each other. Such a nervous system would, at least, be anomalous; and, notwithstanding the justly high reputation of the eminent professor of Berlin, we cannot but think that the interests of physiology require us to pause before we assent to the views of Professor Ehrenberg,as re- lates to the nature of the filament in question. In the Sterelmintha or parenchymatous En- tozoa of Cuvier, the same acrite condition, both of the nervous and muscular systems, is still observable in the lower forms belonging to this group of internal parasites, which being', for the most part, in their natural situations either en- closed in cells or closely imbedded in the sub- stance of the viscera of other animals, could not be expected to have any power of locomo- tion conferred upon them; their bodies are, therefore, in the simplest species (such as the Hydatids, Cysticerci) mere membranous bags of homogeneous texture, and without a trace of fibre in their composition : their powers of moving are proportionately feeble, and are limited in fact to slight contractions, which are but indistinctly perceptible on the application of stimuli to the surface of the living animal. In the Tape-worms ( Tenia) the presence either of nerve or muscle is equally impercep- tible, and the whole structure strictly conform- able to the Acrite type. As, however, we mount higher in the scale of organization among these parasites, we again find how nearly succeeding types of structure are made to approximate, and even to a certain extent to become blended, as it were, with each other. In the Flukes (Distoma) and kindred genera, and in many of the Acanthocephalous Sterel- mintha, although their structure is evidently parenchymatous, the skin, without presenting any decided appearance of muscular fibre, be- comes more coriaceous and contractile, and at the same time nervous filaments become dubi- ously perceptible : a transition is obviously in progress, and thus we are gradually introduced to another and a more elevated series of animals. The Nematonfatra, as is obvious from every part of their economy, are gifted with higher attributes, and permitted to enjoy a more extended intercourse with external ob- jects than any creatures comprehended under the preceding division. They are no longer rooted to one spot or imprisoned in enclosed cavities, but, on the contrary, are for the most part erratic in their habits, and in many of them the locomotive system is so efficiently con- structed that their movements, exhibiting con- siderable activity and energy, argue the posses- sion of distinct and precisely arranged muscles, searches are well known, that, although they had examined several hundred specimens of the Beroe in question, for the purpose of ascertaining this im- portant fact, their endeavours to detect the nervous system referred to had been entirely unsuccessful. and display such combination and consentane- ous action of different parts of the body co- operating to produce a given result, that the existence of an intercommunication throughout the system by means of nerves might readily be predicated, even had not anatomy revealed to us that such animals actually possess a ner- vous apparatus. It would seem indeed to be clearly indicated by the physiological relations that exist between the two systems, that the possession of muscular fibre arranged in dis- tinct fasciculi involves, as a matter of course, the co-existence of nervous threads, whereby the actions of distinct and distant muscles may be associated for the attainment of a common object; and accordingly we find that these two important additions to the animal economy make their appearance simultaneously. No large ganglionic masses are as yet developed of sufficient importance to be regarded as consti- tuting a common sensorium, to which the per- ceptions derived from external senses must be referred, and from whence mandates of volition can be supposed to emanate. Senses, there- fore, that is, localized and special senses, can- not as yet be given ; the traces of individuality are but feebly recognizable ; the vital powers are still, to a great extent, diffused throughout the different tissues of the body, and not col- lected and concentrated, as in animals pos- sessed of brains, that is, of centralized and dominant aggregations of newine; and, as a consequence of this important circumstance, some of the most striking characters common to the Zoophytes still linger in this division of creation ; the radiated form is yet extensively met with, multiplication by mechanical divi- sion of the body is still, to a certain extent, possible, and severed portions of the body are found to be reproduced by growth from the mutilated part. The Ccelelmintha or cavitary intestinal worms, living in the interior of other animals, differ in so many points from the Acrite Entozoa, that Cuvier, although in the Regne Animal he was content to group them together in the same class, was obliged to separate ihem into two distinct orders^ calling the Sterelmintha " intestinaux parenchymateux," while the more highly organized are'designated " intestinaux cavituires." The Ccelelmintha, in fact, are or- ganized in accordance with quite a different type of structure, as must be at once evident upon the slightest comparison between them. The digestive apparatus is now no longer com- posed of tubes excavated out of the general mass of the body, and presenting no outlet for the escape of egesta, but a distinct alimentary canal now makes its appearance, suspended in a capacious abdominal cavity, wherein, more- over, are lodged the male and female organs of generation, which in the Ccelelmintha are gene- rally found in different individuals. The pa- rietes of the body are in these worms obviously muscular, and are composed of contractile fibres arranged in superposed strata and affect- ing different directions. Towards the exterior of the body they are disposed longitudinally, but the inner layers assume a circular or spiral

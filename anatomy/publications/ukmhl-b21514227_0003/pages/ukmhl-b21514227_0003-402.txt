380 m u in u i n h, m a l a . connecting it with its fellow of the opposite side (called ' ligamen- tum nuchae'by Meckel), and is inserted into the spine (' margo anterior scapulae,' Meckel) and acromion process of the scapula, and into the outer half of the cla- vicle. The latissimus dorsi, a very long and broad muscle, arises from the spines of all the dorsal and lumbar vertebra3, and from the eleven posterior ribs; it is in- serted by a broad and strong tendon into the distal half of the ulnar margin of the humerus. At its anterior part tins muscle may be sepa- rated into a superficial and deep stratum. The rhomboideus is a single muscle, but thick and long, extending from the occiput to the narrow base of the sca- pula. The splenitis is united by an intermediate ten- don with the opposite muscle, and is inserted into the mastoid pro- cess. The biventer cervicis and the complexus are distinct throughout their whole course, which ex- tends from the anterior dorsal and posterior cer- vical spines to the occi- put ; the complexus is the longest and thickest muscle, and divides into an external, shorter, and deeper-seated portion, and an internal, longer, and superficial portion. The sacrolumbal^ ari- ses from the dorsal ex- tremity of the ilium, is attached to the ribs, over which it passes in its course to its insertion into the transverse pro- cesses of the four or five posterior cervical verte- bra?. The longissimus dorsi is a much thicker and narrower muscle, and extends from the dorsal aspect of the sacrum along the spine to the third or fourth cervical vertebra.

The ideas that have been broached respecting the affinities and classification of the Mammalia after Cuvier, and which are most remarkable for their novelty and boldness, are those which have emanated from the naturalists of the Eng- lish Quinary school. The founder and the most talented of this sect—Mr. W. S. Macleay —thus enunciates his views of the analogies ob- servable between the principal groups of Mam- malia, and those into which the class of birds is resolvable. " Every Mammiferous animal," he says, " may be reduced to these five orders; that is, may be assimilated, in a greater or less degree, to one or other of the following typical forms; viz. Man, the Lion, the Horse, the Whale, and the Mouse. I shall show hereafter how these five orders form a continued series return- ing into itself, so as to be a natural group. In the mean time, I must recall to the attention of the reader the orders of Birds as defined and ar- ranged by Mr. Vigors; and to which definitions and arrangement I have just applied so severe a test, only to corroborate their accuracy, and to make them display additional harmony. " When we have heard the Parrot or Main- ate speaking; when we have witnessed the former feeding itself as it were with a hand ; when, in short, we have reflected on the remark- able intelligence and development of brain throughout the whole order of Insessores, to which both birds belong,—there has been no one, perhaps, dull enough not to compare them to Primates,.,, I allow, indeed, that it is diffi-

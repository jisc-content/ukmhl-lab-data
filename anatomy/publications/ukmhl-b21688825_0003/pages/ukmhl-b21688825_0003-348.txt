3^4 OF THE PELLUCID MEMBRANES. thefe veffels are only Ihrunk fo as to convey only colour lefs fluids. I have, therefore, in the firfl place, to give my reafons why I think that thefe veflfels of the foetus are not fubfervient to the humors; and, I think, I fhall prove that, when they have once difappeared, they are no longer pervious veflfels; that, though thofe parts which they are fuppofed to fupply, Ihould become in- flamed and vafcular in the adult, thefe veflfels which were apparent in the foetus do not become enlarged $ that they do not adminifter in any way to inflammation and difeafe, but that a new fource is given, and that veffels are formed which wrere at no former period difcernable. Why Ihould there be red blood tranfmitted to the! pellucid membranes and humors of the foetus ? Why is not that ftate of circulation, which nourifhes and fupports the parts in the adult ftate, fufficient for theif growth and the progrefs to perfection which they un- dergo in the foetus ? Why is the capfule of the lens only crowded with veffels carrying red blood, While the proof of veffels palling to the cells of the vitreous coat ftands upon fome very rare and vague affertions, and fuch as can be naturally explained by the appear- ance of thofe veffels which merely pafs through the vi- treous humor for a different deftination ? I believe .this is a view which has been little attended to ; but, upon the molt minute enquiry, and upon ex- amining the preparations of the vafcularity of the eye of the foetus, I can fee no veffels, palling into the hu- mors and carrying red blood, which are not finally diftributed to the membrana pupillaris. When we lay open the eye of a foetus, after a very minute and fuc- cefsful

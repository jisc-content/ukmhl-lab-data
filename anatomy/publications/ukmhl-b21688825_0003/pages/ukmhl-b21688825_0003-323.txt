299 OF THE RETINA, But on the evening of the fame day, about the. fetting of the fun, he began to fee but obfcurely, and his fight gradually departed from him, and he became as blind as on the preceding night; though his limbs continued as well as in perfedt health ; nor had he, from the firft night, any complaint from that quarter. The next day, with the rifmg fun, his fight return- ed ; and this has been the almoft conftant courfe of his difeafe for two months part:. From the fecond night, the fymptoms preceding the darknefs were a flight pain over the eyes, and a noife in his head, which he compared to a fquafhing of water in his ears. After near two months continuance of the difeafe, on September the 29th, the patient was able to fee all night; on the 30th September, Odtober 1 and 2, he was again blind all night; on the 3d, he was able to fee ; on the 4th, he was blind till 12 ; on the 5th was blind. From this he had no return of his complaint till June 1755 ; from which time till the 3d of Odtober, when I again faw him, he had three or four attacks ; from the 3d till the 10th, he had an attack every even- ing.â€”He had at this time a purging. I ordered him an eledtuary of bark and nutmeg, which fucceeded in removing the blindnefs, but the diarrhsea continued wafting him. On the 20th, delirium came on ; on the aift, he became deaf; he died on the 25th, after having fuffered from fever, pain in his bowels, and continued diarrhsea; but the defedt in his eyes never returned after the 10th. This man had clear bright eyes: when his fight failed him the pupils were en- larged about one-third in diameter. Medical Fadls and Enquiries, vol. i. p. 111. X4 Boerhaave

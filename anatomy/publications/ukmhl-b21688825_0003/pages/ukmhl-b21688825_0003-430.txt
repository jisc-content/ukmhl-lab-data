OF THE HUMAN EAR. 406 more like an accidental fiflure, than a regular paffage, effential to the ceconomy of the ear. It appears thus irregular in the bones from the tube being towards the back of the nofe, compofed of membrane and carti- lage ; as the tube approaches the opening behind the palate, it widens into a trumpet fhape; and the foft extremity of the tube is governed by mufcular fibres. There can be no doubt that the euftachean tube is defigned for admitting the free accefs of air into the cavity of the tympanum, that, by preferving a due balance betwixt the atmofphere and the air contained within the ear, the motion of tire membrane of the tympanum may be free. This, at lead, we know, that, when the extremity of the euftachean tube is clofed, we fuffer a temporary deafnefs, which can be accounted for only by the confined air wanting a due degree of elafticity to allow the vibration of the mem- brane of the tympanum. I conceive it to be neceffary, that the air in the tympanum be changed occafionally, which is, perhaps, accomplifhed by fome adions of the throat and fauces forcing a new body of air into the euftachean tube. The extremity of the euftachean. tube, next to the throat, may be temporarily ob- truded by the cynanche tonfrllaris, which is frequently attended with pain, ftretching from the throat to the car ; or it may be clofed by inflammation and adhefron of its mouth, by adhefron of the foft palate to the back of the fauces, by polypus in the nofe, reaching- down into the fauces and compreffing it* **.

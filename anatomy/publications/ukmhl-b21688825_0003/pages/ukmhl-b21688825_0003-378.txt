354 OF SEEING IN GENERAL. what thefe diagrams {hew, may be eafily produced, viz. the feeing two objedts fmgle: for, if we look at a halfpenny and a {hilling, placed each at the extremity of two tubes, one exactly in the axis of one eye, and the other, in the axis of the other eye, we (hall fee but one piece of coin, and of a colour neither like the {hilling nor like the halfpenny, but intermediate, as if the one were fpread over the other. This relation and fympathy between the correfpond- ing points of the two eyes, is, therefore, to be ion- fidered as a general fadt, viz. that pidtures of objedts falling upon correfponding points of the two retinas, prefent the fame appearance to the mind as if they had both fallen upon the fame point of one retina; and pictures upon points of the two retinas which do not correfpond, and which proceed from one objedt, pre- fent to the mind- the fame apparent diftance and por- tion of two objects, as if one of thofe pidtures were carried to the point correfponding with it in the other retina. Several animals, we fee, diredt their eyes by very different laws from thofe which govern the motion of ours; but we are not to reafon upon their fenfations by the laws of vifion of the human eyes : we muff take it as a principle, that nature has been bountiful to them alfo ; and that the refult of organization in their eyes is perfedt vifion. In birds, (if we except the owl), the eyes diverge, and are diredted to oppolite fides. As the owl feeks his prey in the night, it .may be neceffary to the di- ftindtnefs of his vifion in weau light, that both eyes be diredted to the objedt. Moil fifties have their eyes di- â–  redted

OF THE RETINA. 28 I two diftind parts, viz. the medulla of the nerve, and a pellucid membrane fupporting it; but, however rea- fonable this conclufion is, I cannot believe that thefe portions are to be feparated by dilfedion. It is, by moft anatomifls, believed, that the retina palfes for- ward betwixt the vitreous humor and ciliary body, and adheres to the margin of the lens. Now, as this ad- hefion is not a glueing together of parts, but a union or intermixture of membranous filaments, the inter- change and mingling of fibres, we may fafely fay, that the membrane of the retina is continued over the lens, and forms part of its capfule. The opacity of the re- tina is diminifhed at the root of the ciliary procelfes, and difappears altogether at the margin of the lens; and here it is not only changed by becoming perfedly tranfparent and allied to the membranes of the humors, but it becomes alfo diflinguilhable from the opaque retina by a greater toughnefs and flrength. The con- tinuity of the retina with the capfule of the lens is more apparent, when both membranes have become opaque by being immerfed in fpirits or vinegar, but more par- ticularly when that opacity is produced by difeafe. In difeafe, I have found the veins of the retina running over the margin of the lens, and branching on its pof- terior convexity. Where the retina lies betwixt the vitreous humor and the ciliary procelfes, it is plaited, and defcends into the interfaces of thefe procelfes. When we take off the fclerotic and choroid coats of the eye, by dilfeding them round the infertion of the optic nerve, and fold them back, carefully preferving the retina ; and when we have taken away the ciliary U 3 procelfes

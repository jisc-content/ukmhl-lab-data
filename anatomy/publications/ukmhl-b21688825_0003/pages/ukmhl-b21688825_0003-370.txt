346 DISTANCE OF OBJECTS, menâ€™s eyes; but when he diredts his attention to the more remote objedls, thofe nearer become indiflindt. Now this indiftindtnefs of the objedt, feen when he ex- amines narrowly the objedls beyond them, would argue, (did we admit this mufcular power in the eye of adapt- ing itfelf to objedls), that the cornea or the lens has be- come lefs convex, were we not previoully convinced that the utmoil powers of the eye could not bring the objedt at the diflance of 12 feet, or any other interme- diate diftance, to be more diftindtly feen than the fixed and permanent conflitution of the eye admits. I cannot hJp concluding, therefore, that the me- chanifm of the eye has not fo great a power of adapt- ing the eye to various diflances as is generally imagin- ed, and that much of the effedt attributed to mechanical power is the confequence of attention merely. An objedt looked upon, if not attended to, conveys no fenfation to the mind. If one eye is weaker than the other, the objedt of the ftronger eye alone is attended to, and the other is entirely neglected: if we look through a glafs with one eye, the vifion with the other is not attended to. Now objedts, as they recede from us, become fainter and fainter in their colours, and the general effedt upon the eye is different from thofe which are near ; and as it happens that the mind muff affociate with the fenfation before it be perfedt, there is, confe- quently, an obfcurity thrown over diflant objedls when we contemplate near ones; as, on the other hand, the images of near ones are not attended to when the mind is occupied with diflant ones, although they be nearly in the line with the diflant objedt examined. I conceive it to be a good deal like that command of u the

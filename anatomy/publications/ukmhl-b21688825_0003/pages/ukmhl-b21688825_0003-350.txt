326 ' Of FHE PELLUCID MEMBRANE. little forward from the utmofl verge of the lens, where they are united to the velfels of the membrana pupil- laris and ciliary procelfes. Were thefe velfels of the capfule provided for the fecretion of the lens, or were thofe velfels the trunks of lelfer branches which pierce into the fubltance of the lens, they would appear alfo on the fore part of the capfule. If I am accurate in thefe obfervations, we are autho- rized to deduce this important conclufion:â€”that thefe velfels which we fee running through the vitreous hu- mor and capfule of the lens, and which are fometimes feen filled witfr red blood or injected with fize and Vermillion, are not the velfels of the humors, but velfels in their palfage to the membrana pupillaris, and that they difappear totally when that membrane is ab- forbed. They are injected when the membrana pupil- laris is inje&ed; they are more difficult to fill when that membrane is becoming pellucid and tender towards the latter period of gellation ; and with the annihilation of the membrane follows the difappearance of the velfels carrying red blood through the tranfparent hu- mors of the eye. In confirmation of the total annihilation of thefe central velfels of the vitreous humor, I have found that, when difeafe comes upon the lens of the adult, the velfels, which are apparent in confequence of inflam- mation, do not proceed through the old traft from the centre of the optic nerve and through the vitreous humor to the lens, but that they come from the ex- tremity of the retina and laterally, and thence fpread over the back of the lens.

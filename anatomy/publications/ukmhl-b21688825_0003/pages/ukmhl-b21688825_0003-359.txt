Distance of objects. 335 fourteen feet five inches, would require fuch a prelfure as might lengthen the axis of the eye one tenth part, which again would form an oval that would derange the retina. Another opinion is, that when the eye fees the neareft objects it is at red; and that, in attending to diftant objeCts, the ftraight mufcles draw back the fore part cf the eye into the focket, and thus fhorten the axis. To this opinion, of courfe, the fame objections lie as to the fuppofition that the axis is lengthened by the operation of the mufcles. There are fome who have entertained an opinion, that the iris, by its contraction, operates fo on the cir- cular margin of the cornea, where it is connected with the fclerotic coat, as to make the cornea more convex, and thus encreafe its power of concentrating the rays and enable the eye to fee near objeCts diltinCtly. To account for this power in the iris, Dr. Jurin, the pro- pofer of this hypothefis, fuppofes that there is a greater mufcular ring in the margin of the iris connected with the edge of the cornea: the exiftence of thefe mufcular fibres is not demonftrated, but he fays, fince the leffer mufcular ring in the inner margin of the iris is not proved by ocular infpeCtion, and yet is juftly inferred from its effeCts, viz. the contraction of the pupil; in the fame way, “ the change of conformation in the eye has not yet been adequately accounted for, but may be fairly made out by fuppofing the exiftence of the greater mufcular ring.” His conclufion is in thefe words:—■ “ When we view objeCts nearer than the diftance of “ 15 or 16 inches, I fuppofe the greater mufcular ring “ of the iris contracts, and thereby reduces the cornea “ to

81 OF THE '"VENTRICLES OF THE BRAIN. LATERAL VENTRICLES. Under the corpus callofum and medullary centre, are the lateral ventricles. They are diftinguifhed into right and left. They are of a very irregular fhape, firetching into three prolongations or cornua, whence they have the name of tricornes. They are the great ventricles of the brain; the third and fourth being comparatively very fmall. What may be confidered as the bodies of thefe ventricles are formed betwixt the corpus callofum and medulla of the brain, and the convexity of the corpora ftriata and thalami nervorum opticorum. Following the cavity forwards, we find what is called its anterior horn or finus, formed betwixt the more acute convexity of the corpus flriatum and the antes io: part of the corpus callofum ; into the pofterior lobe of the cerebrum, refting upon the ten- torium, there flretches backwards with fome confider- able curve, and, at the fame time, with a flight in- clination downwards, the posterior horn. Again, the inferior or descending horn is like the continued cavity of the ventricle; it takes a curve backwards and outwards, and then turning forwards it defcends into the middle lobe of the brain. The lateral ventricles do not terminate in the others by any of thofe prolongations; but they communicate, upon a very high level, with the third ventricle and with each other, by a wide opening, formed under the fore part of the arch of the fornix. This communica- tion we eafily find by following the choroid plexus for- ward and under the fornix: it is a fpace betwixt the moil anterior part of the convexity of the optic thalami and the anterior crura of the fornix* Vol. Ill, G o.f

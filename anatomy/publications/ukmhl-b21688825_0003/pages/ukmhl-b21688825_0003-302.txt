OF THE RETINA. The retina is a membrane of the moll delicate tex- ture of any in the animal body : it is tranfparent in the recent (late, and fo foft, that it will tear with its own weight. In fpirits and weak acids, it becomes opaque and firmer. It lies expanded over the vitreous humor, and contiguous, but not adhering, to the choroid coat, or its pigment. The retina does not confiit merely of the expanded nervous matter, but has, in its corn- pofition, a very fine membrane, and many minute vefiels. When the retina is macerated for a confider- able time, the pulp of the nerve can be waflied away, and there remains only the reticulated and delicate membrane which fupports the veffels that nourifh it. But though the pulp of the nerve may be diffolved, it cannot, by difiedion, be freed from the membrane which fupports it *. I have a preparation which more refembles fome of Ruyfch’s plates than any I have feen. In this preparation, the nerve being wafhed away, we may fee diftindly the whole courfe of the arteria centralis retinae. Of this preparation I have given an engraving, to fhow how plentifully this organ is fupplied with red blood j from which circumftance we may learn the ftrid de- * ,l Poffe vere medullarem retinas laminam removed ut vafculofurn rete membranse figuram retineat, alteramque ab altera integram de- trahi ultra hominum artem pofitum elfe videtur nec ulli unquam con- tigifTe, legere me memini, etfi, deleta macerendo medulla, rete vafeu- Iofum laminam peculiarem referre videatur.

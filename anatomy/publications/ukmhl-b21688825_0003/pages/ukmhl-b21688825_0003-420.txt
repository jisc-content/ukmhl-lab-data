396 OF THE ORGAN OF HEARING. other flep towards the proper ftru&ure of the terref- trial ear. OF THE EAR IN BIRDS. Comparing the internal ear of birds with that of thofe animals which we have already defcribed, we find a very important addition. We find here the in- ternal ear (or labyrinth, as we may now call it), con- fining of three divifions : the veftibule, or middle cavity ; the femicircular canals ; and the cochlea; which lad is an additional part, and one which we have not in the clafs of animals already defcribed. Leading into thefe three cavities, there are two fora- mina : the fenestra rotunda, and the fenestra ovalis j and both thefe openings have a membrane ftretched over them in the frefh (late of the parts. The firft, the feneftra ovalis, or foramen ovale, re- ceives the ofiiculus auditus, which is in birds like that which we have already defcribed in reptiles *. This ofiiculus connects the membrana tympani (which is * Mr. Home, in his ledlure on_the mufcularity of the membrana tympani,*(vid. Phil. Tranf. A. 1800), fays, in birds this membrane has no tenfor mufcle to vary its adjuftments, but is always kept tenfe by the preflure of the end of the {lender bone. This is a very im- perfedf account of the mechanifm of the tympanum in birds. There are two bones, or one fmall bone with a cartilage, which lies along the membrana tympani. This elallic cartilage has two little tendons attached to it. Even the (lender bone which ftretches from, the cartilage to the foramen ovale, the inner extremity of which is en- larged to fill up that hole, feems to have a fmall tendon inferted into it; but whether this be a mufcukr or ligamentous connexion, I am unable at prefent to fay. here

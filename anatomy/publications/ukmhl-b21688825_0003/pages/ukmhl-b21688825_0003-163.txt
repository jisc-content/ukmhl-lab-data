OF THE PARTICULAR NERVES. I 37 the and confequently diftort the eye-ball and produce blindnefs. Such has been found to be the effect of lip-htninv in fome inftances. O O 2d, The nasal branch of the opthalmic nerve fends off a Hip or twig to form with a branch of the third pair, the lenticular or opthalmic gang- lion ; while the trunk of the nerve paffes obliquely forwards, and inward through the orbit, and gives off one or two extremely fmall twigs, which join the fafci culi of ciliary nerves. The nafal branch then continues its courfe betwixt the fuperior oblique and addudtor mufcles; before piercing the orbital plate, it fends for- ward a branch, which palling under the pulley of the fuperior oblique mufcle, joins that divifion of the frontal nerve which paffes over the pulley. The nafal nerve then paffing through the internal orbital foramen, enters the fcull again, and runs under the dura mater, which covers the aethmoid bone, to pafs through the cre- briform plate of that bone, and again to elcape from the cranium. It is finally diftributed to the upper fpongy bones, and to the frontal fmufes. We thus obferve fuch a connexion of the nerves of the eye and nofe, and of thofe diftributed to the inner angle of the eye, and mufcles of the eye-lids, as fuf- hciently accounts for the fympathy exifling among thofe parts. We fee the neceffity of this connection, fince the excitement of the glands which fecrete the tears, the adtion of the mufcles, and the abforption of the tears into the nofe, muff conflitute one fympathe- tic adlion. The lenticular, or, opthalmic ganglion, comes naturally to be confidered under this divifion of

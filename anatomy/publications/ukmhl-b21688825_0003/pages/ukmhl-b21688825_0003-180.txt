154 OF THE particular nerves. nerve pafs the bone diftind from the others, and after- wards unite into the proper trunk of the par vagum. Deep under the lower jaw and the maftoid procefs, the glolfo-pharyngeal nerve, the par vagum, the fpinal acceffory, the fympathetic nerve, the portio dura of the feventh, and the upper cervical nerves, are entangled in a way which will fatigue the diffector, and may account for every degree of fympathy of parts. The par vagum, lying behind the internal carotid artery, and as it were efcaping from the confufion of the ninth acceffory and gloffo-pharyngeal nerves, defcends and fwells out into a kind of ganglion*. We now obferve three branches to be fent off: The first and second pharyngeal nerves, which pafs to the conftridtor pharyngis mufcle, and the internal laryngeal nerve. This laft-men- tioned nerve is even larger than the gloffo-pharyngeal nerve. It is behind the carotid artery, and paffes ob- liquely downward and forward. In its progrefs the prin- cipal branch paffes under the hyo-thyroideus mufcle, and betwixt the os hyoides and the thyroid cartilage; while others, more fuperficial, pafs down and are con- nedled with the external laryngeal, or pharyn- go-laryngeus; which is a nerve formed by the fym- pathetic, and par vagum conjointly. The principal branch of the internal laryngeal nerve, which runs under the hyo-thyroideus, is diftributed to the fmall mufcles moving the cartilages. The minute extremities of this nerve pafs alfo to the apex of the epyglottis, and the glandular membrane covering the glottis. We * Trtincus gangliformis octavi, tumidulum corpus olroare, Fallopii; but it is fufpected that in this he meant the ganglion of the fympa- thetic nerve, haves

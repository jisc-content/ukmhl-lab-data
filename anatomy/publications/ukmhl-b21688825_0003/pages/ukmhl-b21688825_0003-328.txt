It was difcovered by Haller, Albinus, Wachen- dorf#, and Dr. William Hunter, at the fame time or without correfpondence with each other. Haller j-, after inje&ing, with oil of turpentine and cinnabar, a foetus of the feventh month, faw through the cornea the vef- fels of the iris injetted, and fome ramifications from them produced into the fpace of the pupil. From convi&ion that no veffels ramified without an involving membrane, he naturally concluded, that a membrane was drawn acrofs the pupil of the foetus, though, in this inftance, it was about to difappear. In feveral other foetufes of the feventh month he confirmed his firfl obfervation; and, cutting off the cornea, he obferved the membrane impelled forward by the humors behind like a little veficle.

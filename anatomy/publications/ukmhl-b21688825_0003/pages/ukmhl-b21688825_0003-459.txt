435 OF THE HUMAN EAR. fills the greater part of the veftibule ; for only a part of it is received into the fovea. It forms a complete fac, and has no communication with the other foft parts of the labyrinth, though lying in contact with the alveus communis, prefently to be mentioned ; and being furrounded with an aqueous fluid, it muff re- ceive the impreflions of found in common with them. Alveus communis ductuum semicircularum. This facculus lies in the femi-eliptical fovea of the vef- tibule, or, like the other facculus, is in part received into it. This facculus receives the extremities of the tubuli membranacei which lie in the femicircular ca- nals ; it is a little bag common to them, and connect- ing them altogether, as in fifhes: it is filled with fluid, and is fo pellucid, as to be diftinguiflied with much diffi- culty *. Upon prefling the common fac, or the am- pululae of the femicircular canals, the fluids are feen to circulate along the membranous tubes of the canals. Thefe two facculi in the veftibule lie together, and firmly adhere, but do not communicate ; yet, (as may be eafily imagined), they cannot be feparated without tearing the partition. Tubuli memeranacii. The tubuli membranacii are the femicircular tubes which pafs along the ofleous femicircular canals, and to which the latter are fub- fervient, merely as fupporting them. They are con- nected by means of the common alveus in the veftibule, and form a diftinCt divifion of the organ. * Froprio humore turgidus adeo tranflucet ut ablongum bullu- lam aeream mentiatur.

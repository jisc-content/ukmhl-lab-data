Or TliE VENTRICLES OF THE BRAIN. 94 with the probe the connections of thofe membranes we could penetrate into the lateral ventricle without pier- cing the fubllance of the brain ; fo here we can pene- trate into the third ventricle, which is deepeft of all; and alfo into the fourth, without lacerating the fub- llance of the brain. Thus, after raifing the vafcular membrane of the bafe, we can pafs a probe under the corpus callofum backwards into the third ventricle, and by raifing the cerebellum from the medulla ob- longata, and feparating the adhefions of the pia mater, we get accefs to the fourth ventricle. We conclude then, that the ventricles are not formed, as we Ihould at firft conceive, in the fubftance of the brain, but that they are formed by the replication and foldings of the convolutions of the brain.

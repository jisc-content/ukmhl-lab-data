From the fimpler to the more perfect aquatic anh mals, we may trace feveral links of the chain by which nature advances towards the perfect flrudture of the ear. We return now to oblerve, in the firft example of terreflrial animals, the moll fimple (late of that part of the organ which receives the fenfation ; but where the ftru&ure of the receiving organ is the molt fimple^ the mechanifm for receiving the vibration and convey- ing it to the internal ear, is modified and adapted to the atmofphere. OF THE EAR IN REPTILES AND AMPHIBIOUS ANIMALS. In reptiles, which form the intermediate clajs of animals betwixt fifties and quadrupeds, the ear has alfo an intermediate ftrudture ; in fome individuals of this cfafs the ear refembles that of fifties, fuch as we have defcribed, while, in others, it refembles more nearly the common ftru&ure of terreflrial animals. In the falamandra aquatica, a variety of the lizard, there is a foramen ovale *, deep under the integuments. In this foramen there is a cartilage, in immediate con- tact with which, there is a commofi facculus lying in the cavity or veftibule; and in this little fac there is found a cretaceous matter : there are here, alfo, femi- * This is the appropriated appellation of the opening which leads from the outer cavity of the ear, or tympanum, into the feat of the proper organ when: the net-re is espâ€™amled. circular

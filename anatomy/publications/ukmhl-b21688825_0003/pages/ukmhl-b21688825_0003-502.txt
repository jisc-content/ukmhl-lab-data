47$ OF TOUCH AND OF THE SKIN. vafcular membrane was the rete mucofum fuccefsfully injedted ; but afterwards it was found, that this vafcular membrane exided independently of the rete mu- cofum *. Mr. Cruickfhanks conceives that it is cutticle in its date of formation, and that the rete mucofum is in fact a cutticle advancing to the date of perfect ma- turation. But I fhould rather believe that this is a vafcular furface, not changeable, nor lofing its vafcu- larity to be thrown off in form of rete mucofum; but, in itfelf, the organized furface, which is to form the rete mucofum, and which excretion does in fucceffion become cuticle. This vafcular furface of the Ikin, for fuch I mud fuppofe it, although it be capable of being feparated by long maceration and putrefa&ion, into fomething like a didinft membrane, is the feat of the fmall-pox pudule, and probably of many other cuta- neous difeafes. There are three laminae above the true Ikin, dif- tinguifhed by their character ; the cutticle, the rete mu- cofum, and the vafcular membraxie : but as fome have divided the rete tnucofum into the lamina, Mr. Cruick- fhanks has feparated two vafcular layers from the fur- face of the fkin. They, who are fond of fuch minute fubdivifions, may thus enumerate five laminae or mem- branes, before coming to the porous furface of the q-ue fkin. * Mr. Baynham, who difeovered this vafcular fin face, conceived that he had injected the rete mucofum. We are to find the further elucidation of this piece of anatomy from Mr, Cruicklhanks. â€¢r OF

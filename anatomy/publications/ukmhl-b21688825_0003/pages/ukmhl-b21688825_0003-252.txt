22ยง OF THE EYE.' fun has its own peculiar degree of refractability, ac- cording to which, it is more: or lefs refra&ed in paf- fing through pellucid fubflances, and always in the fame manner: and, laftly, that the rays are not fplit snd multiplied by the prifni. When a ray of light falls upon the furface of glafs obliquely, it inclines to a line drawn (through the point of incidence) perpendicular to the furface. KlA2f. I . Thus the ray A. fig. i., proceeding from the ob- ject *, is refra&ed upon entering the mafs of glafs in the direction B, having a tendency towards the per- pendicular line. By this means, if a number of rays proceeding from any one point, as in fig. 2., fall on a convex or fpherical furface of glafs, they will be in- fiedled fo as to gather about the perpendicular line a a in the centre of the glafs : which perpendicular line is the axis of the glafs. If the rays of light proceeding from an objedt be made to ftrike into a mafs of glafs \yith a concave furface, the obliquity with which they impinge upon the furface, being the reverfe of the convex

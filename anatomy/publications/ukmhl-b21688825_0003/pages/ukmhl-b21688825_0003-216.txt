190 OF THE PARTICULAR NERVES. the coraco-brachialis mufcle, it fends down a branch of communication with the radial nerve; and in many fubje&s it will be found to be like a branch from one of the origines of the radial nerve. Where the nervus perforans lies betwixt the brachieus internus mufcle and biceps, (and, of courfe, after it has perforated the co- raco-brachialis mufcle), a branch or two are fent up to the heads of the biceps mufcle; another branch turns inward to the belly of that mufcle; and, finally, twigs pafs inward to the cellular membrane, which in- volves the brachial artery. The continued nerve pafTes obliquely acrofs the arm, and under the biceps. When approaching the outfide of the arm, it divides into three finall branches j one to the integuments which are upon the fupinator longus, another to the integuments on the infide of the fore- arm, and a third, which continues its courfe along the edge of the fupinator longus to the wrift. Of this pro- longed branch of the perforans Cafferii, a minute twig is loft on the ligament of the wrift, another palfes to the ball of the thumb, and a third goes round to the integuments of the back of the thumb. 5. The radial nerve. This nerve is formed by thofe divifions of the plexus which furround the bra- chial artery, and fometimes by a divifion of the per- forans Cafferii. It takes its courfe by the fide of the brachial artery, and gives off no branches until it has funk under the apponeurotic expanfion of the biceps mufcle. When the radial nerve has come to the bend of the arm, it gives off three branches. The firft belongs fo the pronator teres, flexor radialis, and palmaris longus, and

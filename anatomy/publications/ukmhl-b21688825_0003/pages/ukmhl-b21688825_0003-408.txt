384 of The ears of animals. by Dr. Scarpa, a mucous du£t merely * ; which does not lead into the facculi of the veltibule and femicircu- lar canals, as appeared to Dr.Monro; and that to luppole this would be to acknowledge the free accefs of air and water to the immediate feat of the organ, and to the foft pulp of the auditory nerve, a thing abfurd in every view, impoffible in nature, and very wide of the truth f. To me, it appears, that this narrow dudt cannot be confidered as the external ear ; becaufe we find in the fkate a proper membrane under the thin integu- ments, quite unconnected with the duct* for tranfmit- ting the found ; and, upon following this mucous dudt, we find it taking a circuitous courfe, and filled with a ftrong gelatinous matter ; it is every where narrow, and filled with a glutinous fecretion. It has no membrane ftretched acrofs it, and bears no refemblance to the external ear of any other animal. “ other, furrounded with a firm membranous ring, may be ob- “ ferved. Thefe are the beginnings of the Meatus Auditorii Ex- “ terni.” Treatife on the Ear, p. 208. * Dr. Scarpa, fpeaking of this opinion of Dr. Monro, fays, “ qua in re vehemer.ter iibi hallucinatus eft, oftia nimirum dudiuum mucoforum, ut manifeftum eft, pro auris meatubus accipiens. “ Etenim omnino nullum eft in cartilagineis pifcibus oftium auditus “ extus adapertum, membranaque fenejlra ovalis fub communi ia- tegumento recondita jacet et cooperta.” f “ Quod et abfurdum eft et a rei veritate quam maxime alie- <c num.” Vid.

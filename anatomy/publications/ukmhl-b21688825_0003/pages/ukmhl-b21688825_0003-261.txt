237 OF THE EYE. until, by degrees, he comes to fee perfectly at the dis- tance moll convenient for the common affairs of life. It has been, by fome, thought extremely difficult to account for the image appearing to us, as it is in nature, eredt, Since it is adtually figured on the bottom of the eye in an inverted pofture ; but the terms above and below have no relation to the image in the bottom of the eye, but to the pofition of our -bodies and the furrounding things. When I look to a tall manâ€™s face, I direct my eyes upward; I obferve his Situation, as it relates to an ideal area before my eye, or to a fpace in the Sphere of vifion. When an objedt approaches towards the eye, the diameter of the picture on the retina encreafes in the fame proportion as the diftance between the eye and the objedt decreafes ; and, confequently, it decreafes in the fame proportion as the diftance encreafes. But the degree of brightnefs of the pidture of an objedt on the retina continues the fame at all diftances, between the eye and the objedt, unlefs fome of the rays of light are interrupted in their progrefs; for, as the advancing objedl becomes bright, it encreafes doubly in length and breadth, or quadruply in Surface. The faint appearance of remote objedts, therefore, is occafioned by the opacity of the atmofphere. There is nothing more aftonifhing in the ftrudture of the eye, than the fenfibility of the expanded nerve, as proved by the extent of the changes or degrees of light which illuminate vifible objedts; or the great de- gree of light which the eye can bear, and the low de- gree of light at which objedts are vifible. Thus, the proportion betwixt the degrees of light illuminating an objedl

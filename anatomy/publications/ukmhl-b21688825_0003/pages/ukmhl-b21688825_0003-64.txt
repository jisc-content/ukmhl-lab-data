OF THE VEINS OF THE BRAIN. 44 the inferior part of the finus *. All thefe veins of the furface of the cerebrum have very free inofculations with each other. I cannot any where better obferve the negligence of authors, in regard to the glandulae Pacchioni, than when {peaking of the mouths of thofe veins which open into the great longitudinal finus. I cannot help thinking, that many of our bell au- thors have overlooked entirely the importance of the glandulae Pacchioni; and many alfo have been entirely ignorant of them. We have already mentioned, that a few fmall bodies by no means conftant nor regular, were to be feen upon the external furface of the dura mater, in thecourfe of the longitudinal finus, or at no great diftance from it. We have mentioned alfo thofe fatty-like adhe- fions of the roots of the veins as they enter the finus, and which rather belong to the pia mater. Both thefe are called the glandulae Pacchioni improperly. The bodies which engaged Pacchioni and Fautonus in fuch violent difputes, are feen on the infide of the longitudinal finus, and are connected with the opening of the veins f; - they s Vicq d’Azyr. •f “ In longitudinali finu, imme&kte, Cub membranofis expanlioni- “ bus, in areolis cliordarum Willifianarum, quin et fupra eafdem chor- ** das eonfitx funt inumerae glandulae conglobatae, propria, et tenuif- “ fima membrana, veluti in facculo conclufoe ; quoe racematim ut “ plurimum coeunt; raro fparfim difponiuntur: has glandulae utrin- u que ad latera falcis mefforiae, ab ejufdem apice ad bafis ufque pof- u ticam partem miro prope modum artificio procedentes, dorfo la- •* certorum accumbunt, & partim ab horum libris, partim ab iis, u quae a chordis emergunt, firmantur, atque invicem alligantur, ita “ ut pon nifi lacerat acu disjungi pofiint.” Vide Pacchioni, p. 126.

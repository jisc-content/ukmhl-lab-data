He expe&ed, by this operation, to give elafticity to the confined air. Accordingly, by pun&uring the membrane of the tympanum with a fmall trocar, he found, with much fatisfa&ion, that the hearing was inftantly reftored *. Valfalva made a good diftinction, when he faid, that the membrane of the tympanum was not abfolutely neceflary to hearing, but only, to perfect hearing. We have, in this fadt, the explanation of the follow- ing circumftance, amongfi: many others: 46 In naturali <c furditate a conformationis vitio inter tandum iftud “ experimentum, (viz. an officuli et membrana tym- “ pani aliquis fit ufus auditum), quod inopinato et “ feliciter fucceffit cuidam, qui intrufo auri fcalpio in i( aurem profund iffime difrupit tympanum, fregitque “ ofiicula et audivit.” Biolanus Encherid.

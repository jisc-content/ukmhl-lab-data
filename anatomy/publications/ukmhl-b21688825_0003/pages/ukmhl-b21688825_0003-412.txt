In thefe animals, the ltrudture of the ear is very fimple ; but it appears to me, that Profeflor Scarpa, in his defcription, has imagined to be the organ more fimple than it is in nature. In the lobster, there proje&s from near the root of the great antenna, an offeous papilla of a peculiarly hard and friable nature. In the point of this papilla we obferve a foramen, and a membrane ftretched over it. This is the feat of the organ of hearing. It is defcribed as containing a fac of a pellucid fluid, which adheres to the membrane, while the auditory nerve is expanded upon the lower furface of the fac. Nov*', the lobfter, being an animal which can live on land as well as in water, Scarpa gives this as an inflance of a lfrufture calculated to receive the fenfation of found equally well from the water or from the atmofphere. But, from the figure I have given of the ear of this creature, it wili not appear to be fo exceedingly fimple ; while there is evidently a provifion for the reception of the vibra- tion communicated through the water, though it does not

CHOROID COAT AND IRIS. 271 fequently the iris to fall in contadt with the cornea j the iris adheres, and often forms ftaphyloma. Thus we find ftaphyloma to follow the operation of extrac- tion, in cbnfequence of the iris protruding and adher- ing to the wound : again, in ftaphyloma from fmall- 'pox, by the adhefion of the iris to the cornea, while the cornea is extending and perhaps burfts, the iris mixes with the cornea, and gives the ugly black and mixed colours of this difeafe. I have a preparation in which the cornea had greatly dilated ; the iris is ex- tended like a black net-work upon the inner furface of the cornea ; and in the ufual place of the iris, the ci% liary procefles are to be feen. The iris adheres alfo to the capfule of the lens, which is behind it, and, as we fhall prefently fee, clofe upon it. I faw it in one in- ftance, adhering fo ftrongly to the cataradt, that, in attempting to deprefs the cataradt with the needle, the edge of the iris was turned over and deprefled with the needle, and the regularity of the pupil was deftroyed; of courfe, here, there could be no permanent depref- fion, without previoufly cutting this adhefion. It was at one time believed, on the authority of many excellent anatomifts, that the veflels of the iris were colourlefs, and did not circulate red blood: after what has been faid, it is fcarcely neceffary to mention the fallacy of this opinion *. I have feen the iris cut and bleeding, though not profufely as I ex- * Dr. Monro, in treating of this fubjedl, mentions his having feen a net work of veflels covered with paint darker than that of the iris, and extended from the iris upon the furface of the lens; and, in another inflance, a net-work of filaments palling quite acrofs the pupil.

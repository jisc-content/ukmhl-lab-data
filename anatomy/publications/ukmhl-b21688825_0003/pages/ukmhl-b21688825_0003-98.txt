72 OF THE VEINSOF THE BRAIN. the brain may be obftru&ed, or it may be accelerated, until this velocity affects the function * : or the blood may be accumulated ; but during this accumulation of the blood there muff be a proportional fpace, freed by the abforption of the brain itfelf, or the partial accu- mulation of one part of the vafcular fyltem of the brain muff neceffarily be accompanied by a deficiency of the other. * There is much found reafoning and ingenuity wafted on the fubjett of the circulation of the brain : As the gentle murmuring of a ftream, fays Lower, lulls to repofe, while the mind is difturbed, cr the imagination awakened by the din of a cataraft; fo fleep is induced by the gentle flow of the blood in the brain, or flies when the circulation is accelerated. As the fatigue and reft of the body required a variation in the impetus of the blood towards it, the ne- ceflary confequence was a variation in the degree of velocity in the circulation and quantity of blood in the head, and this to Lower is the reafon of the vicifiitude of wakefulnefs and fleep. The Ample faÂ£t of the effeft of preflure upon the furface of the brain inducing an opprefiion of the fenfes has occafloned all their theories of fleep to turn upon this one idea of preflure on the brain.

OF THE MEMBRANES OF THE BRAIN. 25 vafcular than that feen upon the furface, and betwist the convolutions of the brain. It has been faid that the ventricles of the encepha- lon ferved to increafe the furface of the pia mater, and that whatever purpofes are ferved by that membrane and its velfels on the furface of the brain, we mud fuppofe the fame performed by it within the ven- tricles *. This feems more like a weighty conclu- fion than it really is. We have feen how minutely dillributed the pia mater is through the fubftance of the brain, independently of the ventricles; and we fhall find that the ventricles have important ufes, without the neceffity of fuppofing them fo fubfervient to the difiribution of the pia mater. As the tunica arachnoides is of a peculiar nature, and has few if any veffels, and as it covers the external furface of the brain only, it feems to me probable that this membrane is the caufe why effufions in the ven- tricles are fo common, and why fluids are fo feldoro found betwixt the furface of the brain and the dura ma- ter. When by the difeafed action of the velfels of the pia mater on the furface of the brain an effufion is thrown, v out, it very feldom lies upon the furface unconfined; but frequently fluids are contained in facs of the arachnoid coat, betwixt the convolutions of the brain, or raife it into pellucid veficles upon the furface. The want of a tunica arachnoides upon the pia mater of the ventricles, may be a caufe of the fluids being fo much more readily fecreted into them. The raifing of the pia mater into vehicles by the aftion of the velfels of the pia mater, is rather an ar« * Dr. Monro’s Nervous Syllem, chap. vi. gument

OF THE HUMAN EAR. 431 fame time, that the modiolus is a nucleus, axis, or central pillar, is a contradi&ion in terms. When we break away the {hell of the cochlea, and break off, alfo, the fpiral lamina, we find the little funnel-like depreflion in the bottom of the meatus in- ternus reaching but a little way up into the centre of the cochlea.â€”We find this depreflion of the meatus auditorius internus perforated with innumerable fmall holes; and thefe foramina are fo placed as to trace a fpiral line, becaufe they give paflage to the nerves go- ing to the fpiral lamina, and mufl take the form of the diminifhing gyrations of the lamina fpiralis. In the centre of thefe lefler foramina, which are feen in the bottom of the great foramen auditorium internum, there is a hole of comparatively a large fize, which pafles up through the middle of the pillar. The mo- diolus is formed of a loofe fpongy texture, and refem- bles the turns of a cork-fcrew; and this fpiral direc- tion is a necefiary cpnfequence of the lamina fpiralis, being a continuation of the fpongy or cribriform tex- ture of the modiolus. Internal periosteum of the labyrinth. We find that the veftibule, the femicircular caiials, and cochlea, befides their foft contents, which we have yet to deferibe, have their proper periofteum, which, after a minute injection, appears vafcular; and this, as it has appeared to me, is particularly the cafe with the lafl: mentioned divifion of the labyrinth. I fee very confiderable veflels diftributed on the veftibule; par- ticularly, I fee their minute ramifications on the cir- cular fovea, while very confiderable branches are feen jto courfe along the femicircular canals. In the cochlea, I fee

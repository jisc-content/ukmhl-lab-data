xS of the Membranes of the brain. of its parts. Thefe partitions are formed by the internal lamina of the dura mater, which is reflected as the peritoneum is to form the mefentery, or the pleura to form the mediaftinuin. The falx is the Iargeffc of the partitions; it is attached to the cranium in the line of the fagittal future, and reaching from the crifta galli of the ethmoid bone to the middle of the tentorium, or to the crucial ridge of the occipital bone, it pafl'es deep into the middle of the brain, and divides it into its two hemifpheres. It is in jhape like a fcythe, for anteriorly it does not pafs fo deep into the fubftance of the brain; but it gradually becomes broader, or defcends deeper betwixt the hemifpheres, as we follow it backwards, which, with the curve, it necelfarily takes from the fhape of the cranium, has ob- tained it the name of falx: it is alfo called feptuin fa- gittale, verticale, or mediaftinuin cerebri. The tentorium feparates the cerebrum and cerebel- lum. It ftretches horizontally over the cerebellum, and fuftains the pofterror lobes of the cerebrum. It is formed by the inner lamina of the dura mater, refle&ed off from the os occipitis alongft the whole length of the grooves of the lateral finufes, and the edge or angle of the temporal bones. This feptum, thus running round the cavity of the cranium, divides it into two depart- ments ; the upper one for the lodgment of the cere- brum, and the lower for the cerebellum. But to allow the union of thefe two great divifions of the encephalon, a circular opening is left upon the anterior part of the tentorium, which is called the notch of the tentorium. There is a little procefs of the dura mater which may be called the falx of the cerebellum. It runs , down

OF 'THE HUMAN EAR. 425 cochlea. It has its name from thofe cavities and tubes leading into each other in fo intricate a manner, as to be followed out with much difficulty. We underfland that the cavities hitherto defcribed in the human ear contain air, and communicate with the atmofphere: but, in the cavities we have now to defcribe, the nerve is expanded, and there is, in con- tad: with it, not air, but an aqueous fluid. In treating of this divifion of our fubjed, we have, firfl:, to attend to the forms of the cavities, as feen when fedions are made in the dry bones next to the foft parts contained in thofe cavities; and, finally, to the diftribution of the nerves. To give an idea of the exquifitely delicate and complex ftrudure of the many canals, excavations, openings, fulci and foveas, of the bones; of the tubuli, facculi, and partitions of the membranes; and, laftly, of the foft expanfions of the nerves, without the affiftance of plates, would be impoffible. Albinus, in his acade- mical annotations, begins very formally a chapter on, the ear ; but, after a few words, difmifles the fubjed, referring merely to his plates. The vestibule, or central cavity of the labyrinth, is of an oval form, and about a line and a half in diameter *. It has two remarkable pits or hollows in it, and has numerous foramina opening from it into the neighbouring cavities, befides lefler foramina for tranfmitting that portion of the nerve which is diftri- buted on the facs contained in it. One depreffion or fovea is in the back and lower part of the veflibule, an â€¢ other in the outer and fuperior part of it : the one is * Pu Verney CEuvres Anatomiques, F f 3 circular.

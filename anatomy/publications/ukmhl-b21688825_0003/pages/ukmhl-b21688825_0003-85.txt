59 OF THE VEINS OF THE BRAIN, POSTERIOR OCCIPITAL SINUSES. Thefe are fo called in oppofition to fome irregular and fmall finufes, which run upon the occipital bone before the great foramen. The posterior occipi- tal sinus lies in the little falx of the cerebellum ; it rifes upwards, and opens into the common union of the longitudinal and lateral finufes; it commonly, however, lies rather to the left, and empties itfelf into the left lateral finus. It is by no means * conflant; like the other lefler finufes it is fubjedt to great variety ; and, before it rifes into the tentorium, or empties itfelf into the larger finufes, it has a communi- cation or emifTarium, by which part of the blood may pafs into the external veins, through a foramen in the centre of the occipital bone f. ■ j A. - THE INFERIOR LATERAL SINUSES. The inferior lateral finufes are (till more rarely to be found than the laft, in fo much that Vicq d’ Azyr fays he never has feen them. They run in the lamina, or under the dura mater, of the pofterior fofia of the bafe of the fcull; that is the hollow of the occipital bone, which is under the tentorium. They are fo irregular that they frequently occur in one or other fide only. They communicate with the pofterior part * Vicq d’Azyr. f Malacarne This finus is fometimes double ; or it has two branches encircling the pofterior margine of the occipital hole ; or, as I have already obferved, it takes the office of the great fuperior lateral finufes, and empties it into the foramina lacera ; or they com- municate with the vertibral veins.

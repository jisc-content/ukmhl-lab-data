OF THE RETINA. 277 Where the optic nerve is about to enter Into the ball of the eye, it is much diminilhed in diame- ter ; it is contra&ed and condenfed, and, at the fame time, lays afide the flrong coats. The proper nerve /then perforates a cribriform lamina in the fclerotic coat. Within the eye, the filaments feen in the nerve are no longer diftinguifhable; but from the extremity of the nerve the fine web of the retina is produced. The lamina cribrosa, and the delicate fafciculi of the optic nerve, are Ihown in this manner: After making a feftion of the eye, wafii away the retina from the extremity of the optic nerve, and alfo the choroid coat; then prefs the optic nerve betwixt the finger and thumb, when the pulp of the nerve will be feen to protrude through the foramina in the fclerotic coat like white points. It is obferved. by Zinn, that, in doing this, there is a central foramen which remains unfilled up by the compreffion of the nerve. This is the hole perforated by the arteria centralis retinae *. Where the threads of nerves are accumulated after palling thefe foramina, and before they are finally expanded into the retina, they necelfarily form a fmall cone or papilla. This conical form of the extremity of the optic nerve is much more evident in fome animals than in others; but in a feftion of the human optic nerve we may alfo obferve it f. * Zinn de oculo humano, p. 106.

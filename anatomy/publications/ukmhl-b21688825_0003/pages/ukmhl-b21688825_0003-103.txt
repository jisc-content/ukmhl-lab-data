OF THE VENTRICLES OF THE BRAIN. 77 cles contained air ; that the air fupported the foft me- dullary fubftance of the brain ; and that it gave mo- tion to the whole mafs, fo as to circulate the fpirits in the fubftance of the brain *. OF THE CORPUS CALLOSUM AND CENTRUM OVALE OF VIEUSSENS. The corpus callosum is a medullary body which is a centre of communication ; or it is the great commiflure f palling betwixt the hemifpheres of the ce- rebrum l : it is feen without incifion by merely fe- parating thofe hemifpheres with the fingers. It is a white body, firmer than the reft of the medullary fub- llance. It is but flightly convex upon its upper part, but turns convex downwards upon the fore and back * Malpighi. -f Commiffure is a term applied to thofe tracts generally of me- dullary matter, which paffing through the brain are fuppofed to be % medium of communication. ;{; Willis conceiving the fpirits to lodge and circulate in the fuper- ficial convolutions of the brain, (upon the conformation of which depended the capacity or ability,) gives to the corpus callofum the property of collecting and concentrating the fpirits, “ quafi in “ publico emporio commorantur and here they were depurated by re- peated circulation.—But the language in which all this is delivered better veils the abfurdities of the dodtrine: “ fpiritus recens nati undequaque ab extima hujus corporis ora verfus anteriorem iftius “ corporis callofl partem, ubi craffimum exiilit, perpetim blande “ fcatent; ibidemque, fi opus fuerit, aut imaginationis aftui impen- “ duntur, aut medullae oblongatse crura fubeuntes, appendicem ner- vofam adtuant et infpirant.” What remains fuperfluous of the fpirits returns backwards and circulates through the fornix, and is ftill farther fubtilized, “ hoc motu fubtiliores quofdam phantafis adtus “ peragunt.” part,

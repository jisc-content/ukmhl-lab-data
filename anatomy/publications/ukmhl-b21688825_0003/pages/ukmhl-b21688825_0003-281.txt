OF THE COATS OF THE EYE. 257 Finally, in regard to the choroid coat, we have to underhand that it confifls of two laminae : the outer, and that which is next to the fclerotic coat, being the proper choroid ; the internal lamina, the tunica Ruyfchi- ana: that on the furface of the tunica Ruyfchiana, .there is a pile or fleece, which is called tapetum: and, laftly, that the fecretion of this inner furface is a pig- ment, which, in the human eye, has the appropriate name of pigmentum nigrum ; but, in many animals, it is of a filver, golden, or Ifabella colour; though, in my apprehenflon, the colour, in all thefe varieties, de- pends Hill upon a peculiar fecreted matter. OF THE CILIARY PROCESSES. The ciliary procefles are formed of the anterior margin of the choroid coat; they give the appearance as if the choroid coat, at the anterior part, were folded inward to the margin of the chriftalline lens ; and, as if, to accommodate it to this fudden inflexion, it had been plated, and not regularly contra&ed; at leaft, this is much the appearance of the circle of ciliary pro- celfes, when, after cutting acrofs the eye, we look from behind upon the lens in its natural fituation. In this view, we find the pigmentum nigrum of the choroid coat continued over the ciliary procefles, which gives difeafes of the eye. This is known by the poffibility of feeing to the bottom of the eye; that is, the choroid coat becomes a reflect- ing furface, and throws out the beams like a catâ€™s eye. See Med.

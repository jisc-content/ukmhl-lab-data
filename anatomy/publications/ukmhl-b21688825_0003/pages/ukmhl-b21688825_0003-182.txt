156 OF THE PARTICULAR NERVES. Under the fubclavian of the right fide, alfo, there are fent branches from the recurrent to the cardiac plexus; and on both fides there pafs branches of communica- tion betwixt the fympathetic nerve and the recurrent. When the recurrent nerve has turned round the artery, it afcends in a direftion to get behind the trachea, and it lies betwixt the trachea and aefophagus. It here fends off many branches to the back and membranous part of the trachea which pierce this pofterior part, to fupply the internal membrane. It gives alfo branches to the aefophagus and thyroid gland. The final diflribution of this nerve is to the larynx. It pierces betwixt the thyroid and cricoid cartilages, and feparates into many filaments, which terminate in the crico-arytenoideus lateralis and poflicus, and thyro-arytenoideus, and in the membrane of the larynx. We have already men- tioned the branch of communication betwixt the recurrent and internal laryngeal nerves*, and Sa- batier defcribes a branch of the recurrent, which fometimes afcends and joins the fympathetic high in the neck. Two cafes,mentioned by Galen, of fcrophulous tumors in the neck opened, where the confequence was lofs of voice, have tempted many anatomifts to inflitute expe- riments on the recurrent and internal laryngeal nervesf, * There is a double communication betwixt thofe nerves; in the firfl: place by this more fuperficial branch, and again by feveral in- ternal and more minute branches. f Martin, in the Edinburgh Effays, ProfefTor Sue of Paris, Dr. Highton, iu the memoirs of the Medical Society of London ; Cruik- Jhanks, ProfefTor Scarpa, Arnemann, &c.

OF THE VEINS OF THE BRAIN. 43 the the fame bodies which Ruyfch fo frequently mentions as little particles of fat, and which others have taken to be the glands of the pia mater *. Vicq d’Azyr, in his xxxiiid plate, fig. 14, has confounded them under the name of the glandular Pacchioni f. Of thefe veins lying upon the furface of the brain, there is one, or very often there are two large veins on each fide, and which enter generally pretty far back in the finus, and are fomewhat peculiar from their greater fize,and their fe- micircular courfe. Thefe, from their fiate of dilatation, and the colour and fluidity of their blood, will be found in morbid difledlion, to mark fufficiently, in many in- fiances, the character of the venous fyftem of the brain. There is again another vein fomewhat peculiar in its courfe: whilfl thofe take a fuperficial courfe, and are upon the level of the longitudinal finus, it gathers its branches upon the internal flat furface of the left hemifphere, and rifes fo as to infinuate itfelf into * “ Portio pias matris in liquore, cujus fuperficies exterior obfita “ variis particulis prominentibus exiguis, quas pro glandulis habue- “ runt nonnulli: cum autem fint diverfas formse, et colore pinguidinem “ repnefentent, pro pinguidine potius illas habeo prasfertim cum ‘c inter duplicaturam pice matris aliquoties pinguidinem invenerim.’* Thefaurus Anat. ix.

As to the gland which Willis affirms to be fcattered over the tunica arachnoides, I could never fee them. Ridley.

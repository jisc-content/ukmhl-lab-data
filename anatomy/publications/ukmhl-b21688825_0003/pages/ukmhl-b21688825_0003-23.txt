As the vital organs mult be in perpetual adion to fupport life, nature has guarded thofe functions by making them independent of the will, and lefs imme- diately dependent on the function of the brain. This is a provifion which allows the exhausted mental and bodily fundions to be recruited by deep, while the ope- rations of the animal body necefi'ary to life go on unin- * terrupted. It is an additional reafon for believing the ufe which we have afiigned to the plexus and ganglions to be the true one, that thofe nerves which fupply the vital organs arife by fmall twigs from the brain, take a long courfe through the body, and neither fwell out into large nerves, nor are finally dillributed until they have re- ceived many additions, and formed feveral remarkable plexus and ganglions. As in deep the vital fundions continue uninterrupted, fo the difejifes of the brain, which referable deep, fud- denly deprive the body of all voluntary exertion, while the vital motion remains for a time unimpaired, and finks gradually, for no part of foe body is altogether independent of the healthy fundion of the brain, It is necedary alio that we fhould recoiled the con- nedion of the higher attributes of a living being with the animal economy. The brain, the nerves, and the nervous expanfions in the organs of the fenfes, are dependent for the perpetual renewal and fupport of their fundion upon the circula- B 3 tion I

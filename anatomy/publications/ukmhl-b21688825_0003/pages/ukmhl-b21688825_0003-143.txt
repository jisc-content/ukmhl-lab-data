THE ORIGIN OF THE NERVES. li; Tracing the optic nerves from their origin in the brain towards their exit from the fcull, we find them ap- proaching gradually and uniting juft before the corpora albicantia and the infundibulum. Since the days of Galen, it has been a difputed point, whether there is a union fimply of the nerves, or a de- cuffation. Fifties have the nerve arifmg from one fide of the brain pafling to the eye of the other fide : they crofs, but they do not unite. Birds have but one optic nerve arifing from the brain, which fplits and forms the right and left optic nerves. Vefalius differed a young man at Padua, who had loft his eye a year before; at the fame time he differed a woman, whofe eye had been loft a long while. In the latter he found the nerve of that fide fmaller, firmer, and of redifli colour, through all its extent. In the young man he obferved no effedt upon the nerve. He alfo gives a plate of an inftance in which he found the optic nerves pafs on to the eyes of the fame fide from which they take their origin, with- out adhering at all. 13 Valverda,

OF HEARING IN GENERAL. 445 flribution of the nerves, remain any controverfy; though before the ftrudure of the ear was fo well underftood, fome imagined that the veftibule, others that the middle part of the femicircular canals, was the feat of hearing; others, again, that the lamina fpiralis was better adapted for receiving the vibrations of found. It is evident that the foft expanfion of the nerve, in all the three divifions of the labyrinth, is deftined to receive the un- dulation of the contained fluids, and that this motion of the fluids gives to the nerve, or to the nerve and brain conjointly, the fenfation of hearing. Since we have, in fome meafure, traced the flrudure of the ear from the animals of a Ample flrudure to thofe of a more complicated organization, and have obferved fome parts of the ear common to all animals, fome peculiar to certain orders ; and fince all have the fenfe of hearing, more or lefs accute, it becomes natural to enquire what are the parts of the organ the moft eflential to the mere perception of found, and what parts conduce to a more perfed Hate of the fenfe. All the external apparatus of the ear is not neceflary to give the animal the Ample perception of found.â€” There are many clafles of animals altogether without them, and even in man we fee that they are not ab- folutely neceflary ; Ance when deprived of them by difeafe, man ftill enjoys the fenfe. He is deprived of no eflential variety of the fenfation; he is capable of perceiving the diftindions of articulate found; and Hill poflefles his muAcal ear. The external apparatus of the ear, the membrane of the tympanum, the little bones, and even the external ear, only receive, con- centrate.

THE PARTICULAR NERVES. 1QJ 2 THE ligament, to fupply the mufcles lying on the outfide of the tibia. The tibial nerve, in its courfe amongft thofe pofterior mufcles, accompanies the poflerior tibial ar- tery. When it has arrived behind the inner ancle, it fends off a branch to the integuments of the infide of the foot, and to the abduftor mufcle of the great toe. Continuing its courfe by the fide of the heel-bone and under the ligament, it begins to fplit into thofe branches which are naturally called the plantar nerves, becaufe of their lying in the foie of the foot. THE PLANTAR NERVES. The internal plantar nerve paffes over the abductor mufcle of the great toe, and by the infide of the fhort flexor to the firft metacarpal bone; and in this courfe it gives out feveral twigs to the mufcles of the foie of the foot. It now divides into three branches. Thefe are diftributed to the great toe, to the fecond, the third, and one fide of the fourth toes; and thefe nerves in their courfe give branches to the lumbricales and inter- oflii mufcles. The external plantar nerve is the lefler of the two. It gives branches to the Ihort flexor and addudor of the little toe, and to the, mafia carnea Jacobi Silvii. It gives alfo a deep branch to the third and fourth inte- rofleous mufcle and addudor mufcle of the great toe. Another of its branches makes the arch with the in- ternal plantar nerve, while its extreme diftribution is to the little toe, and to one fide of the fourth toe. Thefe nerves of the foie of the foot are conneded with the internal and external plantar arteries, and are protected like them by the plantar apponeurofis.

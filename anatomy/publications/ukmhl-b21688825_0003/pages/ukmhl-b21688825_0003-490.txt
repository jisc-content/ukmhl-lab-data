465 VELUM PALATINUM. CHAP. III. VELUM PALATINUM; UVULA; ARCHES OF THE PALATE; AND AMYGDALAE. T. he velum pendulum palati is the vafcular and flefhy membrane, which, hanging from the bones of the palate, divides the mouth from the fauces and throat. It is not a fimple membrane, but has betwixt its laminae many glands, which open upon its furface by little patent folicules, and is thickened and ftrength- ened by mufcular fibres: fo that it is more of a flefhy partition, firetching backward and eking out the palate, than a hanging membrane. The edge of the velum palati is not fquare, but turned into elegant arches; and, from the middle of the arches of the palate, hangs down the uvula, fo named from its refemblance to a grape. It is a large, foft, and glandular papilla, peculiarly irritable and moveable, having in it mufcular fibres, and hanging from the moveable foft palate. It feems to hang as a guard over the fauces, and, by its fenfibility, in a great de- gree governs the operation of thefe parts. The arches of the palate or fauces defcend on each fide from the velum palati. They are muf- cular fibre*, covered with the foft vafcular and folicu- lar membrane of the fauces *. There are two on * See vol. I. Conftri&or Ifthmi faufcium and Palato-pharyngeus. each

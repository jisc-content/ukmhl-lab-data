■126 THE ORIGIN OF THE NERVES. border of the corpus olivare, or from the lateral part of the medulla oblongata *. Sometimes they arife in a double feries like the nerves of the fpine : a few fibres are to be traced from the fide of the calamus fcrip- torius of the fourth ventricle. The spinal accessory nerve comes up from the fpine to join the par vagum ; it begins by fmall twigs from the pofterior roots of the fourth, fifth, fixth, and even the feventh cervical nerves. In the fize, length, and origin of thofe little flips, there is much variety : as the nerve afcends to the top of the fpine, it conne&s it- felf with the fuboccipital nerve ; it then paffes behind the trunk of the vertebral artery, approaches the par vagum, and receives forpe filaments from the medulla oblongata.—Thofe three nerves, the gloffo-pharyngeal, par vagum, and acceffory nerves, in their paffage out of the fcull are connected in a very intricate way f. They there feparate from each other. The anterior branch, the gloffo-pharyngeal nerve goes to the tongue and pharynx; the middle nerve, the par vagum, has an ex- tenfive courfe through the body, and finally terminates in the fhomach ; the lowefl nerve, the acceffory, palling into the neck, perforates the maftoid mufcle, and diflri- butes its branches amongfl the mufcles of the fhoulder. NINTH PAIR OF NERVES; OR, LINGUAL. The ninth nerve of the fcull originates from betwixt the corpora pyramidalia and olivaria.

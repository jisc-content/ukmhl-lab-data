One opinion is, that the eye is at reft when we fee the diftant parts of a landfcape, but that the direction, of the eye to the nearer objedts is attended with an effort. This effort is the adtion of the ftraight mufcles of the eye compreffing the ball of the eye, fo as to lengthen the axis as much as is neceffary to allow the pencils of rays to unite in points upon the retina.

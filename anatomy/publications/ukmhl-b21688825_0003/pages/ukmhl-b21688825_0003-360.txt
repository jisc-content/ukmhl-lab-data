336 DISTANCE OE OBJECTS. <e to a greater convexity; and when we ceafe to view “ thefe near obje&s, this mufcular ring ceafes to a£t, “ and the cornea, by its fpring, returns to its ufual <e convexity fuited to 15 or 16 inches. In which con- tc dition the elailicity of the cornea on the one fide, “ and the tone of the mufcular ring on the other, “ may be confidered as two antago niffs in a perfeCf “ equilibrium.” To this opinion it is objected, that the iris is not rooted in the cornea, but in the fclerotic coat, which is firm in man and inflexible in many animals. We have alfo to confider, that this delicate and invifible circle of mufcular fibres has not only to contract the margin of the cornea, but, in this aclion, to alter the configuration of the whole eye. The eye-ball is a whole equally diflended, and no part of it can fuffer contraction without a refifiance from the whole of the coats : befides, in this cafe, the alternation of light and the brightnefs of objects would be perpetually obfcuring the image, by the play of the iris caufing an alteration of the focus of the cornea. But Dr. Jurin did not at- tribute the whole effeCt to the adtion of the iris. He thus explains the ufe of the fluid furrounding the lens and the membranous capfule -.—When the eye is to be fuited to greater diltances, he fuppofed that the liga- mentum ciliare contracts its longitudinal fibres, and, by that means, draws the part of the anterior furface of the capfule, into which thefe fibres are inferted, a little forward and outward. By this aftion, he fuppofed that the fluid, within the capfule of the lens, flows from the middle towards the margin ; and, confequently, the centre of the capfule of the lens is reduced to a lefs * 1 degree

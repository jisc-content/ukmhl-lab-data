OF THE EYE. 2 42 underflood from this (11.) to refradion, and will concentrate its beams at f ; and fo with all the others, alternately refleded and re- fraded. The confequence of this obflrudion to the equal refradion of light, is, 'that the image formed at f is feeble ; but (till it is diflind and perfed ; becaufe the tranfmitted rays are regularly concentrated, and form the proper focus; But if the converging rays fhould be received upon a plain before they arrive at the focus F, the refleded rays of light will have left fpaces dark where they would have fallen by refradion, and^ con- fequently, diflind luminous circles will be thrown on the plain : again, if the plain furface be oppofed to the rays, after they have formed their focus, and are again difperfing after having croffed, the fame unequal effed of light and dark circles will be thrown on it 5 though now, the rays of the right fide of the pencil B d f, will form the left of the pencil F g h. How the flate of the rays produces the indiflindnefs of the near-fighted eye, may be diagram. When the rays A flrike the convex fur- face of the cornea, part of them will be refleded from the furface of the cornea, in the diredion of the lines b b, when they will confequently flrike upon the convex furface changeable

256 OF THE COATS OF THE EYE. texture of the choroid coat. This matter is in imme- diate contadt with the medullary pulp of the optic nerve. Its ufe is apparently to ftifle the rays of light after they have impinged on the fenfibie furface of the retina; for we know that blacknefs is owing to the abforption of the light, as whitenefs and colour is the re- fledtion of it from the furface of bodies. The dark colour of the fecreted pigment of the choroid coat is, in fome meafure, peculiar to thofe animals which fee in the brighteft light of day; but is wanting, or of a bright refledting green or filvery whitenefs, in fuch as prowl by night. The natural conclufion, therefore, is, that the pigmentum nigrum fubdues the intenfity of the impreflion, while the refledting colours of the furface in animals which fee in the night, ftrengthens the effedt of the light on the furface of the retina, by repelling it. As fifties have the other provifions for feeing in an obfcure light, they have alfo this of the refledting fur- face of the tapetum: as it is a fecretion of the villous furface of the choroid, we fee why it becomes fome- what deficient in old men, and fometimes wanting in the degenerate varieties of animals ; when entirely de- ficient, the blood circulating in the vefiels of the cho- roid coat gives a livid rednefs to the refledtions from the bottom of the eye * *. Finally, “ after that we had taken away the membrane which forms the ta- “ petum.” The explanation of this, I fuppofe, will be found in Morg. Epift. An. xvii. 3. * As the pigmentum nigrum is a fecretion, we fhall not be fur- prifed to find it become deficient in the commencement of fome difeafc*

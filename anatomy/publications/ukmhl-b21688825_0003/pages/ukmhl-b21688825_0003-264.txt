OF THE EYE. 240 appear double, or as two luminous lines, with a dark line between them ; and as the diftance is varied, two, ' three, four, or five dark and luminous lines will be obferved. There are many fuch deceptions in viewing luminous bodies; all of them proceed from the fame caufe, which is this :—Before Sir Ifaac Newton’s phi- lofophy was acknowledged, it was the received opinion, that light was reflected from the furface of bodies by its impinging againft their folid parts, and rebounding from them like a tennis-ball when (truck againft a hard and refitting furface : further, as they faw that part of the rays of light were in glafs reflected, and the reft tranfmitted, they conceived that part entered the pores of the glafs and part impinged upon its folid parts. But this does not account for the refractions which take place when the rays have paffed the glafs, and are abopt to be tranfmitted into the air, they cannot find folid parts to ftrike againft in entering the air, for the refraCtion of the light is greater in palling from the glafs into the air, than from the air into the glafs; and if water be placed behind the glafs, the refraCtion of rays palling out from the glafs is not encreafed but di* minilhed, by this fubftitute for the rarer medium of the air. Again, when two glalfes touch each other, no refraCtion is made in rays palling from the one into the other. To explain this. Sir Ifaac Newton taught, that in the prQgrefs of rays of light, there is an alter- nation of fits of eafy tranfition or reflection ; or, in other words, that there is a change of difpofition in the rays, to be either tranfmitted by refraCtion, or to be reflected by the furface of a tranfparent medium.

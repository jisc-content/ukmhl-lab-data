24S OF THE EYE. furface of the lens in luminous rings, thefe rings will be (till farther multiplied and diminifhed in diameter, in being in part tranfmitted, in part reflected, from the furfaces of the lens c, and vitrious humor d d. Thefe effe&s of the alternate difpofition of the rays for tranfmiffion and reflexion would not be perceptible, did the converging powers of the cornea and lens bring the focus of the rays exa&ly to the furface of the retina; but as the focus is formed at e, fome way before the retina, the rays have decuffated and fpread out again before they form the image upon the bottom of the eye. Inftead, therefore, of forming an accurate image, they are fpread out into concentric circles ; or in a leffer degree, the perfon experiences a confufed outline of the objeft, which becomes furrounded with feveral rings or falfe outlines *. * By °f eafy tranfition, it was not meant by Sir Ifaac Newtoa that the rays muft necefiarily be tranfmitted through every pellucid medium, and at any obliquity of incidence, but only that the ray was more eafily tranfmitted and more difficultly refledted ; nor was it meant that, during its ft of eafy reflexion, it was abfolutely inca- pable of being tranfmitted, but only more readily refledied thaa •ranfmitted.

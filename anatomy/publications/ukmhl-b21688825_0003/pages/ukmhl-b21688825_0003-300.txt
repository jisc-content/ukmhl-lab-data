276 OF THE RETINA. of the eye, it is furrounded with a firm (heath 5 and its fubftance is evidently compofed of bundles of fibres, though not fo coarfe, yet like thofe of the nerves in the other parts of the body. The opacity of the nerve makes it have little the appearance of vafcularity, but when the body of the nerve is made tranfparent, it be- comes like a red cord ; fo neceffary is it that the me- dullary fubftance of the nerve be fupplied with blood. The ftronger (heath which furrounds the body of the optic nerve is loofe, and may be feparated into la- mellae. There is a more delicate membrane which im- mediately adheres to the furface of the nerve; and its fubftance is formed into the minute fafciculi which give it the fibrous appearance by a ftill firmer intertexture of membrane. This interwoven membrane proceeds, with the retina, into the eye; the other (heaths are re- flected off, and unite with the fclerotic coat. Some little way from the back part of the eye, the arteria centralis retinas pierces the (heath of the nerve, plunges into the centre, and paffes into the eye along with it. If the optic nerve be cut near to the eye, the open mouth of this fmall artery may be feen ; but if we make our fedtion fome way removed from the back of the eye, it will, of courfe, not be feen. The artery con- tra&ing and leaving a fpace in the centre of the nerve when thus cut, (or perhaps it was the open mouth of the artery itfelf), was obferved by the ancients, and by them called the porus opticus, becaufe they were ignorant of this central artery of the retina *. * Porum opticum Herophilus et omnis ab ca antiquitas dixit, foramen nempe quod in diffe&o nervo de vacua arteria fupereft.

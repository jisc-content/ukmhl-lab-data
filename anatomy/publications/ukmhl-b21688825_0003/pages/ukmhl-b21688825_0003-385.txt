OF SEEING IN GENERAL. 361 is Bb3 is loft, becaufe this habit is no longer of ufe to them*. This I have never obferved, nor Ihould I think it apt to happen, unlefs the mufcles of the eye had been in- jured from the fame caufe which deftroyed the fight; at any rate, it is in a very imperfect degree, and not fuch as we Ihould call a fquint. In regard to the cure of fquinting, it feems the moll reafonable, in the firfl place, to endeavour to ftrengthen the weak eye by ufe, and by tying up the found one. In this cafe, the diftorted eye becomes properly directed to the object, and the ftrength of the impreffion is in fome degree reftored. When this has been perfevered in for fome time, and the perfon is allowed to look at any object with both eyes, the weak eye will perhaps be again diftorted from the true axis; but, probably, with a painful effort and double vifion : which Ihows fome progrefs in the recurrence of the two eyes, and their proper fympathy, and that the impreffion on the weak eye is at leaft attended to. After this, it will be time enough, by Dr. Jurin’s method, to endeavour to corredt the fquint:—“ place the child before you, and let him clofe the undiftorted eye, and look at you with the other. When you find the axis of this eye fixed dire&ly upon you, bid him endeavour to keep it in that fituation, and open his other eye. You will now im- mediately fee the diftorted eye turn awray from you towards his nofe, and the axis of the other will be pointed at you. But with patience and repeated trials he will, by degrees, be able to keep his diftorted eye fixed upon you, at leaft for fome little time after the other * Dr. Reid.

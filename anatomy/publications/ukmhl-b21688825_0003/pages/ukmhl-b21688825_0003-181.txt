OF THE PARTICULAR NERVES. 155 have, at the fame time, to remark a very particular com- municating nerve betwixt this internal laryngeal nerve, and the recurrent branch of the par vagum. This branch is defcribed by Galen. The par vagum continues its uninterrupted courfe betwixt the carotid artery and jugular vein, and is involved in the fame Iheath with thefe veffels. In this courfe down the neck, it fometimes fends back a twig which unites with the ninth pair, and when near the lower part of the neck, it fends forward twigs to unite with thofe from the fympathetic nerve, which pafs down to the great veffels of the heart, to form the fuperior cardiac plexus*. On the right fide, thofe nerves to the great veffels are in general given off by the recurrent nerve. The par vagum now penetrates into the thorax by paffmg before the fubclavian artery; it then fplits into two. The main nerve paffes on by the fide of the tra- chea, and behind the root of the lungs; while the branch, on the right fide, turns round under the fub- clavian artery ; on the left, under the arch of the aorta, and afcends behind the trachea to the larynx. This afcending branch of the par vagum is the recur- rent nerve. On the right fide it is fometimes double. It afcends behind the carotid artery, and fometimes is thrown round the root of the thyroid artery. On the left fide, which, from its turning round the arch of the aorta, is much lower than on the right, it gives off filaments which go to the lower cardiac plexus, after having united with the branches of the fympathetic. * The courfe of thefe nerves to the heart, is beft treated of with the branches of the fympathetic nerve.

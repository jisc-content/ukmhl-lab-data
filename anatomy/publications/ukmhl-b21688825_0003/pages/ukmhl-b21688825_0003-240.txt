2l6 Of THE SENSES'. regulated. In the fubject now before us, we have S very remarkable proof of the fuperiority of inveftiga* tion by experiment over the lazy indulgence of conjecture; and I hope the whole tenor of the follow- ing account of the fenfes will ftrengthen the conviction of the {ludent, that it is only by affiduous ftudy, and patient obfervation of nature, that he is to look for the attainment of knowledge in the medical profeffion. The office of the brain and nerves is to receive the impreffions of external bodies, by which correfponding changes and reprefentations are made in the mind. We know nothing further than that, by the operation of the fenfes, new thoughts are excited in the mind* Betwixt the fenfation excited in the organ of the ex- ternal fenfe, and the idea excited in the brain, there is an indiffoluble, though inexplicable, connection; the brain is not fenfible, nor does the eye perceive, but both together give us the knowledge of outward things. But when the fenfation is once received and com- municated to the brain it is treafured there, and may afterwards be excited independent of the external organ: hence comes the term internal fenfes. INTERNAL SENSES. Though I treat profeffedly of the external organs of the fenfes only, it may be nece'flary here, to fay a few words on the internal fenfes. It appears that all fen-, fations originate in the external fenfes or organs receiving the impreffiohs of outward bodies: imagina- tion is the power of combining thefe fenfations, and memory the power of recalling them. Thefe are powers ' /â€¢

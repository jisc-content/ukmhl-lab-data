CF THE PARTICULAR NERVES. 194 This is a cutaneous branch, and might be confidered as the external cutaneous nerve with as much propriety as the perforans caflerii. Often we {hall find fome leffer branches of the mufcular fpiral nerve piercing the fibres of the triceps mufcle, and terminating in the {kin. The great cutaneous divifion of the nerve, after piercing the triceps mufcle, takes its courfe along the integuments covering the fupinator longus mufcle j and here it fends a branch in upon the bend of the arm, and on the edge of the triceps mufcle. It then defcends upon the outfide of the fore-arm, and divides into three principal branches, and then again into in- numerable cutaneous twigs, and is continued down over the back of the thumb and hand. But the great divifion of the mufcular-fpiral nerve comes out betwixt the head of the fupinator longus mufcle and the bone, and is deep feated. This branch then lies betwixt the fupinator longus, and brachasus internus ; and here it gives off feveral finall twigs to the mufcles. Continuing its courfe by the fide of the fupinator longus and flexor radialis, it divides into a deep and fuperficial branch. The fuperficial branch pafles down on the fide of the tendon of the fupinator longus, and near the wriit it becomes quite fuperficial, and is diftributed to the integuments of the back of the hand. 8. The INTERNAL CUTANEOUS NERVES. Of thofe we may defcribe three :â€” i. The great internal cutaneous nerve. This nerve is derived from the ulnaris at its root, or conies off from

That foramen over which the (tapes is placed, and which is called the foramen ovale, tranfmits the vibration into the veflibule. For the fora- men ovale opens diredtly into the veflibule, and through the veflibule, only, does the vibration of the bones in the tympanum reach the other parts of the labyrinth. Semicircular canals. When we have cut into the veflibule, by taking away th^it portion of the os petrofum which is behind the meatus auditorius inter- nus, we fee five circular foramina : thefe are the open- ings of the femicircular canals. There are three femi- circular canals ; and they are diflinguifhed by the terms, the fuperior or vertical, the poflerior or oblique, and the exterior or horizontal. The one which, in this view, is nearefl, is the opening common to the inner ends of the poflerior and fuperior femicircular canals. When v/e pafs a briflle into this common foramen, and diredt it upward, it paffes along the fu- perior femicircular canal, and will be feen to defcend from the upper part or roof of the veflibule, almofl perpendicularly on the foramen ovale, which is open, and immediately oppofite. If, again, we pafs a briflle into the foramen which is near the bottom of the ca- vity, (and which will be juft upon the edge of the fradlure that has laid open the veflibule, if not included in it), it will come out by the opening common to the

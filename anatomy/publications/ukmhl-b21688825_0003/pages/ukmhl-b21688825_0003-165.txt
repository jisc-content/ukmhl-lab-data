OF THE PARTICULAR NERVES. I39 joined by twigs of the firft branch of the fuperior maxillary nerve. Others conned themfelves with the extremities of the portio dura of the feventh pair, and with the fuperior maxillary nerves. *The fecond branch of the fifth pair ; viz. the fuperior maxillary nerve. The fuperior maxillary nerve, having paffed the fora- men rotundum, emerges behind the antrum highmoria- num, at the back part of the orbit, at the root of the pterigoid procefs of the fphenoid bone. The infra or- bital canal lies diredly oppofite, and ready to receive one branch, while the fpheno-maxillary, opening into the orbit, is above, ready to receive another. The chief part, or trunk, of the nerve may be faid to be feated, and to give out its divifions in the pterigo-palatine foffa* Through the fpheno-maxillary hole, the firft branch of the fuperior nerve is fent into the focket of the eye* This twig unites with branches of the lachrymal nerve, and in general fupplies the periofteum of the orbit. It then fends, through the foramen in the os tnallae, a branch which is dillributed to the orbicularis mufcle of the eye-lid, and communicates with the branches of the portio dura of the feventh pair, or nervus commu- nicans faciei. Another branch of this firft divifion paffes upward from the zigomatic foffa, in a groove of the wing of the fphenoid bone, to the temporal mufcle, and getting fuperficial, it accompanies the branches of the temporal artery. Independently of this branch, which paffes upwards to the temporal mufcle, Miekel, in his firft differtation on this nerve, divides its branches into four: i ft. The infra

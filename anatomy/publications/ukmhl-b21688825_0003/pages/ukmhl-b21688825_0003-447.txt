OF THE HUMAN EAR. 413 a thin greenifh fluid lay betwixt the temporal bone and dura mater. Valfalva' gives us a cafe of injury of the head, in which the patient was relieved while the difcharge of pus by the ear was free; but he died when it was en- tirely fupprefled *. But, after fuch fuppuration as we fliould naturally think mud totally deflroy fo delicate an organization, we are fometimes agreeably furprifed with a gradual recovery of the function. This is owing to the nerve accommodating itfelf, or becoming fenfible to a lefs forcible impreflion, and by the ear acquiring new properties. I already mentioned, that the dellruftion of the mechanifm of the tympanum arofe fometimes from fuppurations beginning in the outward ear ; and we may fuppofe that the apparatus within the tympa- num, when partially hurt, is fometimes capable of being, in fome degree, replaced by a natural procefs ; of which, the following cafe from Valfalva is a remark- able proof. u I lately examined the ears of a woman whofe hearing had been much injured by an ulcer of the tympanum and caries of the fmall bone. I found the ear in which ihe was deaf without a membrana tympani, and the ftapes only remaining of the bones, and a fibrous mafs, like an excrefcence, in the tympanum. * Valfalva, p. 83. See alfo a cafe in Bonetus de Aurium Affefl. Obferv. I., and Gul. Ballonius Epid. et Ephem. lib. 2. p. 270. When the matter was fuppreffed, thtre came pain of the head, and weight, which yielded to no remedy ; on dilfe&ion, there was found an abfcefs within the fkull. In Bonetus loc. cit., a cafe is related, in which an ignorant furgeon comprelfed a fiftulous ulcer in the ear, and fo caufed the death of the patient. F f 2 But,

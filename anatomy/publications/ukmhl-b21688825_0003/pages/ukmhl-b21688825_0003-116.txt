9® OF THE VENTRICLES OF THE BRAIN* I have feen, when the ventricles were diftended lit hydrocephalus, and the communication betwixt the three ventricles enlarged to a fquare cavity of nearly an inch in diameter*, that this union was drawn out to fome length, but ftill was above half an inch in dia- meter. The commifiiira mollis is exceedingly foft, of a cineritious colour, and veffels are fometimes feen to crofs upon its furface. It feems to be the continua- tion of the grey or cineritious fubftance which covers the internal furface of the optic thalami f. Towards the fore part of the thalami we have to ob- ferve a peculiar eminence or convexity, viz. the an- terior tubercles of the optic thalami. In making a horizontal feftion of the thalami, we find that we cut acrofs a medullary Itreak or cord which defcends from this tubercle to the mamillary procelfes, or cor- pora albicantia, in the bafe of the brain J. Its courfe is deep in the fubftance of the brain, and fomewhat oblique. The limits of the thalami externally are con- tiguous to the corpus ftriatum, but betwixt them there intervenes a white medullary trad, which is continu- ous with the medullary ftriae, and which, as it marks the limits of the two great tubercles of the lateral ven- tricles, takes a courfe inwards towards the anterior pillars or crura of the fornix and middle of the anterior commiflure. The furface of this tract, as feen in the * In quadrupeds the adhefion is more extenfive. -[- Mais il n’y a point de continuitc, proprtment dite, entre la fub- ftance intime de ces couches et la commiffure molle Jont il s’agit.

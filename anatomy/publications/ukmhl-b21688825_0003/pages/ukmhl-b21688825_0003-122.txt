96 OF THE VENTRICLES OF THE BRAIN. twixt the thalami nervorum opticorum and before the commiflura mollis. The anus is behind this com- miflure, and near the nates and tefles; both thefe are mentioned as communications betwixt the ventricles : but we know that the union of the plexus chorcides, of the two lateral ventricles, and of the termination of the velum under the anterior part of the fornix, leaves the vulva free. But the velum fpreading over the tha- lami, and under the pofterior part of the fornix, . clofes up the anus ; and it appears as a communica- tion fimilar to the other only when the velum is torn up. If we pafs a probe gently downwards and forwards from, the vulva or foramen commune anterius, or com- munication betwixt the ventricles, we pafs it into the infundibulum. The infundibulum is a funnel of a foft cineritious matter, which leads from the bottom and fore part of the third ventricle towards the glan- dula pituitaria, which is feated in the fella turcica of the fphenoid bone. The infundibulum is formed of cineritious matter, which is continued from the bottom of the third ven- tricle, and which adheres to the back part of the optic' nerves; or, according to Warthon, of an external mem- brane with cineritious matter internally. Its cavity becomes contracted before it reaches the glandula pe- tuitaria. Whether it be really capable of conveying the fluids of the ventricles, or whether it be actually pervious, is likely to remain a difputed point. Tarin, and M. Adolphus Murray, and Haller, believe with the older writers that it is pervious. Scmmerring and Vicq.

OF THE EYE, 239 of fifh, becaufe the aqueous humor is of the fame den- fity with the fluid from which the rays of light are tranfmitted; accordingly, the cornea of fifhes is not pro- minent : this would limit their fpfiere of vifion, were not the flatnefs of the cornea counteracted by the promi- nence of the whole eye, and the more anterior fituation of the chryftalline lens; a large pupil and long diameter of the eye we fliall afterwards find to be neceflary to the diftinCt vifion of fifhes *. It is natural, on the prefent occafion, to inquire into the effeCts of the feveral humors of the eye, in pro- ducing in thofe who are fhort-fighted, the obfcurity arifing from the double appearance of fmall and finning points. This is prettily explained by Juriri, upon Sir Jfaac Newtonâ€™s principle, concerning the fits of eafy refraCtion and reflection of light. The horns of the new moon, or the top of a diftant fpire, or the lines upon the face of a clock, appear double or triple, and fometimes much more multiplied, to a fhort-fighted perfon. The fame appearance will be given when an objeCt is held too near the eye, for perfeCt vifion. If the light is feen through a narrow flit in a board, and the board is brought nearer to the eye than the point of diftinCt vifion, the aperture will * Neither fifh out of water, nor other animals within water, can fee an object diftindtly. Divers fee objects as an old man would do through a very concave glafs put near to the eye ; and it has been found, that the convexity of fpeCtacIes for divers in the fea muil be that of a double convex glafs, equal on both lides to the convexity of the cornea. The neceflity of this is plain ; the aqueous humor being of the fame denfity with the water, there is in it no refraction, and this deficiency muft be fupplied. appear

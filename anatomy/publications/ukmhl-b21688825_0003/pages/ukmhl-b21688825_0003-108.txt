82 OF THE VENTRICLES OF THE BRAIN. OF THE PARTS SEEN IN THE LATERAL VENTRICLES. The fornix is a medullary body, flat, and of a triangular fhape, which divides the two lateral and the third ventricles: its lower furface is towards the third ventricle : its lateral margins are in the lateral ventricle. On its upper furface it fupports the feptum lucidum, or partition of the two lateral ventricles, and under its moil; anterior part is the communication betwixt the lateral ventricles and the third ventricle*. One of the angles is forward, and the other two towards the back part: it refts chiefly upon the thalami nervorum opticorum, but it is feparated from them by a vafcular membrane, which is continued from the external pia mater, and which ftretches into the brain betwixt the pofterior part of the corpus callofum and tubercula quadrigemina, and which membrane conne&s the plexus of the lateral ventricle. The fornix leaves be- twixt it and the concave face of the moft anterior part of the corpora ftriata, a triangular fpace, which is in part occupied by the feptum lucidum. The extremities of this body are called crura. The pofterior crura coalefcing with the corpus callofum, (which is continued downwards pofteriorly,) are pro- longed into the hippocampi, and the anterior crura forming the anterior angle being clofe together, bend downwards behind the anterior commiflure, and are conne&ed with it: they then bend round the thalami, and may be traced into the crura cerebri 5 or, accord* * Of this communication fee farther in the Anatomy of the Brain illuftrated by Engravings, Sng

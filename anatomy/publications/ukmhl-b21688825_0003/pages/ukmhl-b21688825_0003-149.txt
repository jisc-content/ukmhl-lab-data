' THE ORIGIN OF THE NERVES. I 23 tion *. We may fay, however, that the fixth pair of nerves arife from the corpora pyramidalia.—Sometimes the nerve rifes in two branches, which do not unite un- til they are entering into the cavernous fmus f. The fixth nerve is in fize fomewhat betwixt the third and fourth : it paffes forward under the pons varolii, until 'near the lateral and lower part of the body of the fphe- noid bone : it thence continues its route forwards and downwards by the fide of the carotid artery, through the cavernous fmus : here it feems increafed in fize.— It gives off that fmall twig which anatomifts account the beginning of the great fympathetic nerve. The fixth nerve, after giving off this delicate thread, paffes on through the foramen lacerum to the abdudlor muf- cle of the eye. SEVENTH PAIR OF NERVES ; OR, AUDITORY. The feventh nerve arifes from the pofterior and late- ral part of the pons varolii, at the point where it is joined by the crura cerebelli. But this feventh pair of Willis confifts of two parts ; the facial nerve or portio dura, and the audi- tory or portio mollis j the laft is the larger and pofte- rior portion J. The portio dura comes out from the foffa formed betwixt the pons varolii, corpora olivaria, and crura * Simple as the anatomy of the nerve is, Vieufiens, Morgagni, Lietaud, Window, Sabatier—all differ in their account of the ori- gin of this nerve in fome little circumftance; and Vicq d’Azyr gives fix varieties of it. ft Sabatier. 4.

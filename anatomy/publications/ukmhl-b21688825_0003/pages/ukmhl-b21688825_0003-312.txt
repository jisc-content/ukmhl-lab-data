But as animals fee which have no paint on the cho- roid, neither fuch as will abforb, nor fuch as will ftrongly reflect the rays, and which have merely the furface of the choroid with its coloured blood-veflels in contact with the retina ; fo, it is evident, that it is not the deficiency of the choroid coat, nor the want of the black paint at the entrance of the optic nerve, which prevents the fenfation, but really, that there is here no furface formed and organized to receive the impreflion of the light; the outer furface not being the fenfible furface of the retina. FURTHER OBSERVATIONS ON THE RETINA. It has already been obferved, that vifion is the com- bined operation of the organ, nerve, and brain ; con- fequently, the deftru&ion of the fun&ion may be pro- duced by difeafe of the retina, of the optic nerve, or of the brain. Difeafe in the retina, nerve, or corre- fponding part of the brain, caufing total blindnefs, while the cornea and humors of the eye remain pel- lucid, is called amaurosis. It is, in general, to be confidered as a paralytic aife&ion.

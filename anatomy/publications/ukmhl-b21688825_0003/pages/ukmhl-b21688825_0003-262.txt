238 OF THE EYE, objeCt by the fun, and by the moon, at any equal alti- tudes, is calculated at 90,000 to 1 *. Again, by M. de la Hire’s calculation, v/e fee the fail of a wind- mill, fix feet in diameter, at the diftance of 4000 toifes. The eye being fuppofed to be an inch in diameter, the picture of this fail, at the bottom of the eye, will be of an inch, which is the 666th part of a line, and is about the 66th part of a common hair. This gives us an idea of the minutenefs of the flruCture of the optic nerve. The pupil of the eye is formed by the central per- foration in the iris or curtain, which hangs before the lens. This body having mufcularity, is moveable ; it dilates or contracts the ho|e or pupil, tranfmitting the rays fo as to adapt the diameter of the flream of light, darting into the eye, to the intenfity or degree of light. If a body is illuminated but faintly, the pupil is (in- fenfibly to us) enlarged, and a greater quantity of the rays are allowed to be tranfmitted to the retina. But as the convexity of the pellucid part of the eye, an4 the concentrating powers of the lens, remain the fame, the fize of the image is not altered by this dilatation of the pupil, but only the ftrength of the image of picture in the bottom of the eye is encreafed. We underltand that the rays of light are refraCted, when they pafs out of one medium into another of dif- ferent denfity.—For example, the rays of light are re- fracted towards the perpendicular line, when they enter the cornea of the human eye; but they will be re- fracted in a very fmall degree in entering the cornea * See Smith’s Optics, vpl. i. p. 29.

226 OF THE EVE0 if there be any obliquity in the original direction; but if it Itrikes from one medium into another perpendicu- larly to the furfaces, its original direction is not changed. If the ray palling from the air enters obliquely into glafs or water, or any denfer medium, it turns more towards the perpendicular ; but if it paffes through the glafs and emerges again into the air, it refumes its ori- ginal direction, diverging from the perpendicular. This effeCt of different mediums upon the ray of light, is called refraction : when a ray of light impinging upon a furface does not enter, it rifes again to the angle of its incidence ; and this is reflection. The prifm is a piece of glafs of a triangular form j the inclined furfaces of which, when placed in the courfe of the ray of light, refraCt, and feparate the feveral parts of the heterogeneous ray, and Ihow its compound nature. If the fun be permitted to flhine into a dark room through a fmall hole in the window- fhutter, and the beam of light be made to fall upon a glafs prifm, it is, in palling through the glafs, fepa- rated into its conftituent parts; becaufe the feveral coloured rays have different degrees of refrangibility, in the order in which I have already enumerated them. If the rays, after palfmg through the prifm, be made to pafs alfo through a convex glafs, they are brought again to a point in the focus of that glafs ; and the effeCt of the whole colours thus reunited, is perfeÂ£l whitnefs.' We might fufpeCt that the beam of light were homogenous, and that the degree of refrac- tion gave different colours to the rays, were it not proved, that how much foever any of the coloured rays is further refraCted, it does not change its nature ; nor

i / Â£o6 of the particular nerves. the popliteal nerve, is' the tibial nerve. Whilft it Is yet in the hollow behind the joint formed by the ham- ftring tendons, it gives off a nerve which comes out from the ham, and defcends fuperficially on the back of the leg. This has been called ramus communi- cans tibiei. When this nerve has arrived oppofite to the beginning of the tendon achillis, it turns a little to the outer fide, palling upon the outer margin of the achilles tendon, over the outer fide of the heel-bone, and is finally diftributed on the outfide and fore-part of the foot. Upon the back of the leg, this nerve unites with a branch defcending from the fibular nerve, nearly in the fame courfe, and with the fame deffi- nation. After giving off this fuperficial branch, the tibial nerve fends branches to the back of the knee-joint and popliteus mufcle, to the plantaris mufcle, and to both heads of the gaftrocnemius. It then defcends be- hind the articulation, and behind the head of the tibia. It then paffes under the origins of the foleus, and be- twixt the foleus and flexor longus digitorum pedis, and tibialis pofticus, and defcends to the inner ancle. In this courfe it furniflies many branches to the lower part of the popliteal mufcle, to the tibialis pofticus, to the flexor communis digitorum, and to the flexor po- licis longus, and many of thefe branches, and in cuta- neous twigs. We have alfo to obferve a particular branch which the tibial nerve detaches, which paffes betwixt the heads of the tibia and fibula, and goes to fupply the mufcles arifing from the fore part of the in- teroffeous ligament. Further down, two or more fmall branches of the nerve alfo perforate the interoffeous ligament.

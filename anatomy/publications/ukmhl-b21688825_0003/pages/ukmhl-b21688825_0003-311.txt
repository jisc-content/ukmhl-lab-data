OF THE RETINA. 287 and brain. 'But the thalami nervorum, the optic nerve, and its expanfion into the retina, feem fcarcely to have ever occurred to thefe fpeculators, as worthy of notice in this inveftigation. The following appears to me the true account of this matter. It is demonftrated, that the inner furface of the retina is a web of membrane conveying velfels, and that the outer furface'of the retina confifts of the pulpy- like nervous matter. This latter, then, is the organ- ized furface adapted to receive the impreffion of the rays of light. At the point where the optic nerve comes through the coats of the eye, there is no pofte- rior furface peculiarly adapted to receive the impreffion of light; and, as well might we expedt the optic nerve to be fenfible to the impreffion of light in any point of its extent from the brain to the eye, as at this; for here the inner furface of the retina only is formed; there is no pofterior furface upon which the rays can impinge. The doubts regarding the caufe of this fpot giving no fenfation, have arifen from the idea, that the internal furface of the retina, or its fubflance, felt the impreffion of the rays of light. At the fame time, it is evident, that the choroid coat, and its fecretion, is in a mofl remarkable manner fubfervient to the retina, as the inflrument of vifion: for, when the fecretion is black, it abforbs the rays; and animals which have fuch a pigmentum nigrum, fee belt during the full day : again, when the furface is of a ffiining nature, it repels the rays, and this con- tributes to flrengthen the fenfation ; and fuch animals are fitted for feeing in obfcure light: nay, further, if the furface of the choroid be coloured, the animal will fee

I98 OF THE PARTICULAR NERVES. tum. The ftrlt lumbar nerve fends down the external fpermatic nerve. This joining the fpermatic plexus, helps to fupply the cord and tefticle; and in women the fame nerve goes to the womb within the pelvis, and following the round ligament, terminates on the fat of the pubes and groin. A branch from the fecond lumbar nerve paffes alfo to the glands and fat of the groin, the pubes, and cremafter mufcle. This branch is remarkable for the circuitous courfe it takes round the ilium and infide of the ligament of the thigh. ANTERIOR CRURAL NERVE*. This nerve arifes from the union of the fecond, third, and fourth of the lumbar nerves, or the fecond and third lumbar nerves uniting into one trunk, are afterwards joined by a divifion of the fourth f, or the anterior crural, is formed by the anterior branch of the •third and the firft branch of the fecond lumbar nerve J, or by the four firft lumbar nerves; and the anterior crural nerve, at its origin, lies under the pfoas mag- nus, and, as it defcends, it holds its courfe between the pfoas magnus and iliacus internus. It then defcends towards the thigh, and paffes out under Paupart’s liga- ment ; and in its courfe along the brim of the pelvis, it is for feme way covered by the external iliac artery. Here, while within the pelvis, it gives off feveral fmall nerves, which pafs into the iliacus internus, and under the pfoas magnus mufcles. Thefe form a kind of fmall plexus. * Crural nerve, tmneus lumbarum, femoralis magnus, f Fifcher—Walter. J Sabatier and Haller. As

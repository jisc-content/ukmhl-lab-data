OF THE HUMAN EAR. 434 tus rectus * ; they do not lead into the veftibule, but into the beginning of the lamina fpiralis, where it divides the two fcalas cochleae, and turns the orifice of one of them, (by a beautiful curve), out into the tympanum. Nearer to the ridge which divides the two foveae of the meatus internus, there is a little pit which has alfo a cribriform plate (like that which is in the upper fo- vea, and is called macula cribrofa) ; oppofite to this point, the infide of the veftibule is rough and fpongy : it tranfmits a portion of the nerve to the facculus in * the hemifpherical finus of the veftibule f. OF THE SOFT PARTS CONTAINED IN THE LABYRINTH. Within the veftibule, femicircular canals, and coch- lea, there are foft membranes independent of the pe- riofteum. Thefe form facculi and tubes which contain a fluid, and have the extreme branches of the portio mollis diftributed among them. Betwixt the foft and organized facculi and tubes, and the periofteum of the ofieous labyrinth, a watery fluid is exuded. Sacculus vestibuli. The hemifpherical and femi-eliptical foveae which we have defcribed in the vefti- bule, contain, or at leaft receive partially, two facculi. The facculus which is in the hemifpherical cavity, re- ceives the moft convex part of the facculus veftibuli. This fac is diftended with a fluid, and is pellucid, and * Traclus fpiralis foraminulofi initium. Scarpa. â€¢j* Scarpa. fills

OF THE PARTICULAR NERVES. *73 It is remarked, that none of thefe branches of the fym- pathetic nerve are diftributed to the larynx and pha- rynx without being mingled and alfociated with the gloffo-pharyngeal nerve, or with the pharyngeal branch of the par vagum *. Of the nervi molles, fome form a plexus upon the internal carotid artery. Thefe are extremely foft and pulpy, and are united with branches which defcend from the gloffo-pharyngeal nerve. A net-work is alfo formed, which covers the beginning of the external carotid artery. From this, as from a center, branches are fent out with the arteries to the neck, and face, and glands under the jaw; and thefe laft, with a mefh which paffes up upon the temporal artery, unite with the portio dura of the feventh pair. It has been often obferved, that the branches of the carotid artery have a peculiar provifion of nerves, and that thefe nerves are more numerous and minutely dif- tributed than in any other part of the body. There are indeed no nerves in any part of the body which have fo extenfive and intricate connexions with im- portant nerves as the cutaneous nerves of the face and neck. This diftribution of the nerves is, I conceive, a provifion for that power poffeffed by the imagination, or rather that uncontrolable connexion which exifls betwixt the feelings and the aXion of the veffels in blufhing.

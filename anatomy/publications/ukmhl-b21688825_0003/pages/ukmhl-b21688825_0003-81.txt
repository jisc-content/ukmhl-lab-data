OF THE VEINS OF THE BRAIN. 55 fidering that the finufes, like the other veins of the body, are very apt to be irregular. LATERAL SINUSES, OR THE FIRST AND SECOND OF THE ANCIENTS. The lateral finufes are formed by the fplitting of the lamina of the tentorium, as the longitudinal finus is by that of the falx. From the crucial ridge of the occi- pital bone they flretch nearly horizontally ; following the connexions of the tentorium in a direXion toward the petrous bone ; then they take a curve downwards and forwards, to terminate in the internal jugular vein; pafiing through the foramen lacerum of the temporal and occipital bones. Very frequently the one lateral finus is larger than the otherâ€”generally the right is the larger, and fome- times the left is entirely wanting *. They diverge from the termination of the fuperior longitudinal finus at the crucial point of the occipital bone: but fometimes they are irregular, diverging higher, and even pafiing round in the circle of the pofterior part of the cranium, at fome diftance from the tentorium f. The right lateral finus for the moft part begins higher than the left. It is generally longer, and may be confidered as the continuation of the longitudinal finus. Nay, in fome fubjeXs, the right or left lateral finus begin from the longitudinal one, while that of the other fide is continued from the fourth, or the tor- * Lieutaud Anat. Hift. f Malacame.

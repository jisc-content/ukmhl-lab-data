OF THE VENTRICLES OF THE BRAIN. 93 Flan oftkc communication of the Lateral k 3 d Ventricles Rejiiefented liv a perpeuxLculal Section. The third ventricle opens forward and upwards into the two lateral ventricles, and under the common com- munication it opens into the infundibulum. Back- wards it is continued by a canal which paffes under the tubercula quadrigemina, or nates .and teftes, into the fourth ventricle. The bottom of the third ventricle is clofed by afmall flratum of cineritious matter, cloifonpul- peitfe du troifieme â€¢ventricule; this fills up the fpace be- twixt the jundlion of the optic nerves and the anterior Gommiffure. We fee it when differing the bafe of the brain. Lifting the optic nerves, we lhall find it ftrengthened by the pia mater, and confiding of ftrige which pafs obliquely backwards and downwards, and fome of which, while they adhere to the optic nerves, pafs into them. As we have found that the pia mater could be traced into the lateral ventricles, and as by tearing 6 with

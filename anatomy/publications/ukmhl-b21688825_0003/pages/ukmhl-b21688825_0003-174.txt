The fympa- thetic nerve is thus, as it were, a fyftem within itfelf, having operations to perform of which the mind is never confcious; whilft the extent of its connections occafion, during difeafe, fympathetic affections not eafilv fcrutinized. The function of this nerve is thus, in a great mea- fure, infulated from the brain. The operations connected with it proceed, even when the brain is wanting ; and it is impoflible ferioufly to confider the fixth nerve as giving the origin to the fympathetic in any other light, than as fuch an expreflion may be fubfervient to ar- rangement, defcription, and general enumeration of the nerves;â€”a thing molt neceffary in fo intricate a piece of anatomy. OF THE SEVENTH PAIR OF NERVES. The nerves of the feventh pair confift each of two fafciculi, which arife together, and pafs into the foramen auditorius internus *. But thefe portions do not pafs through the bone in union; for the anterior and lefler fafciculus, is a common nerve, which pafles through to the face, and is inverted, like the common nerves of the body, with ftrong coats. It is therefore called the portio dura|. The more pofterior fafci- * The intermediate filaments of Wrifberg, which is betwixt thefe two portions of the feventh nerve, is afterwards united to the portio dura, and muft be confidered as one of its roots. f Galen divided all the nerves of the brain into thofe two claffes, mollis and dura ; of which the firft. were thofe of the fenfe6, the latter the motores corporis. cuius

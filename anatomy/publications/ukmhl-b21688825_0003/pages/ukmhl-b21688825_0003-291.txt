OF THE IRIS. 267 I have, in couching, repeatedly rubbed the fide of the needle againft the iris without exciting any motion in it: I have feen it pricked flightly by the needle with- out its {flowing any fign of being irritated ; nay, what was too a convincing proof, I have feen it cut by fall- ing before the knife in extracting the cataraCt : In this laft inftance, far from being flimulated to contrac- tion, it hung relaxed *. It is evident, then, that no common ftimulus, imme- diately applied to the iris, has any fenfible eifeCt in ex- citing it to contraction ; and that it is fubjeCt only, in a fecondary wav, to the degree of intenfity of light admitted to the retina. The movement of the iris is in general involuntary; but terror and fudden fright affeCt it. In fome animals, particularly in the parrot, it is a voluntary mufclef. As an objeCt, upon which we look, approaches the eye, the pupil contracts, which is an efieCt of the increafing intenfity of the light reflected from the objeCt; for, as the objeCt ad- * This faft dedroys the hypotliefis of M. Mery, of the Royal Acad, of Sciences, that the ftraight fibres of the iris are little cavernous bodies, and that the adtion of the light upon the retina dwelled and elongated them fo as to caufe the diminution of the fize of the pupil; for, by this cut, they mud have fallen from their ereCied date, and contracted fo as to have dilated the pupil.

Roy. des Sc. 1704, mem. p. 261. -j- When a cat is roufed to attention, as by the fcratching of a rnoufe, it dilates the pupil, which allows a dronger impreflion on the bottom of the eye; nay, whenever pufs druggies violently to get loofe, the pupil dilates, which may fufficiently account for M. Meryâ€™s cat having her pupil dilated when he plunged her under the water. See Acad. Roy. des Sc. 1704, mem. 261. T 4 vances.

OF THE HUMAN EAR. 409 E e 3 towards attached to them, by which it is probable, the whole apparatus has a power of adapting the degree of tenfion to the force of the impulfe communicated to the mem- brane of the tympanum. 1 conceive that they encreafe the power of the ear for receiving the weaker founds, and are, at the fame time, a guard to the internal parts, from fuch violent {hocks as might injure the nerve. How neceffary it fometimes is to damp and fuffo- cate, in fome degree, piercing founds, we muff all be fenfible: and in thofe who are habitually expofed to the hidden eruption of found, the fufceptibility of the nerve is injured, and they become very deaf. We have, in a late publication, an example of this in blackfmiths, in whom, it is common to find a degree of deafnefs; and we frequently find old artillery-men quite deaf, from the long practice of their profeflion. The malleus * receives its name from a refem- blance to a hammer or mallet: .it is, in fome degree, like a bludgeon ; the great head hands obliquely off from the body of the bone, (if fuch it may be called), like the head of the thigh-bone. Anatomifts can fcarcely be blamed, if, in defcribing the proceffes of this bone, they forget the body. I fhould confider that part as the body of the bone which ffretches down from the circular margin of the tympanum, and is at- tached to the membrane, or what we fhould confider as the handle of the mallet. This part of the bone {lands at an angle with the head and neck; tapers towards the extremity, and is a little curved down * See plate 9. fig. 1. a.

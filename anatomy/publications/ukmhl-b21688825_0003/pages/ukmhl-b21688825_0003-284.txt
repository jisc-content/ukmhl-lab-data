260 of the coats of the eye. treme branches of the choroid coat; but, of their veins, he fays nothing further than that they are con- tinued from the branches of the vafa vorticofa, or veins of the choroid coat* The points of the ciliary procefles are not attached to the lens, but float loofe in the pof- terior chamber of the aqueous humor *; but at a little diftance from their points, they adhere to the retina, where it is continued over the anterior part of the vi- treous humor. Through this attachment only, are they connected with the lens; for, as we (hall find prefently, the retina (as a membrane, but not as the fenfible retina) is continued over the chriftalline lens f. The ciliary procefles, collectively, form a circle round the lens, which I call corona ciliaris. This circle forming a perfectly opaque partition, which ftifles all rays that might otherwife be tranfmitted by the fide of the lens. The corona ciliaris, or ciliary circle, no doubt, ferves at the fame time as a connexion between the outer and flrong coats of the eye and the tranfparent coats and humors; for, it is to be obferved, that, excepting the connexion which naturally exifts betwixt the optic nerve and retina, this flender hold which the ciliary procefles take of the expanded retina, is the only attachment betwixt the humors of the eye and the proper coats. * This was demonftrated in a particular manner by Ruyfch and Morgagni. f Zinn and other later writers have entertained the idea, that the adhefion of the ciliary procefles to the membranes covering the vitreous humor is by a kind of gluing, rather than a union by cel- lular membrane. See Zinn, p. 75. In

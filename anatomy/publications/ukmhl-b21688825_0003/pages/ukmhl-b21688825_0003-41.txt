23 OF THE MEMBRANES OF THE BRAIN. OF THE PIA MATER. While the dura mater is clofely connected with the cranium, and in contact with the furfaee of the brain, but hill unconnected with it, except by means of veins entering the finufes (and that only in the courfe of the fmufes); the pia mater is clofely attached to the brain, and paffes into its inmofl recedes. While the dura mater is firm and opaque, and not prone to in- flammation, rhe pia mater is delicate, tranfparent, and extremely vafcular. Like the dura mater, it is not endowed with fenfibility * ; it is of great flrength, con- fidering its apparent delicacy f. The pia mater, which was formerly eonfidered as a Ample membrane, confifts, in reality, of two mem- branes, the tunica arachnoides, and the proper pia mater, or tunica vafculofa J. The tunica arachnoides was difcovered and com- mented upon by a fociety formed by Blafius Sladns Quina and Swamerdam §. They called it Arachnoides, becaufe of its extreme tenuity. It was called aifo Mem- brana Cellulofa, from the appearance it took when they infinuated a blow-pipe and blew it up, feparating it from the pia mater. This membrane is without the pia mater \ and while the pia mater finks down into the fulci of the brain, * Haller, Oper. Minor, de Part. Corpor. humani rent. & irrit. •j* Sir C. Wintringham Exper. Eflays. Taken comparatively, it is ftronger than the aorta. j There are many, however, who with Lioutaud canilder the arachnoid coat as the external lamella of the pia mater. § This was in 1665. I am, perhaps, not eorred in faying they difcovered it; for Yarolius dcfcribes it plainly, covering the medulla oblongata. C 3t this

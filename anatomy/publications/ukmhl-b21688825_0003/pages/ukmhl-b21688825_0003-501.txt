OF TOUCH AND OF THE SKIN. 477 fkin, and is of a white tranfparency in the albino, and in the inhabitants of temperate climates. It is black in the negro ; copper coloured in the mulatto ; yellow in the Egyptian. It is fuppofed to preferve the negro from the heat of the climate; but I conceive that the power of refilling the baneful effects of warm climates, mull be looked for in other conllitutional peculiarities: for certainly a furface which abforbs the light mull pro- duce heat more rapidly than a white one, which repels it. The ladies know that the effed of a black veil, in in- tenfe fun-lhine, is to fcorch the cheeks. The rete mucofum changes its lhades of colour in Europeans, from the effed of light, and sometimes makes changes in the conllitution, as in the colour of the areolae â– which furround the nipple. While the rete mucofum has its peculiar ufe of de- fending the delicate furface of the papillae of the lkin, I conceive it to be undergoing a perpetual change ; to be thrown off in fucceflion from the vafcular furface of the lkin, and in its turn to form the cutticle by its outer layers. The inner furface of the rete mucofum is fofter and more pulpy, the outward furface more allied to the cutticle, which gives occafion to Mr. Cruicklhanks to fay it is double. Under the rete mucofum and on the furface of the fkin, there is a foft vafcular membrane, which is Hill above the porous and glandular true kin. It was firlt demonllrated by injedions in fubjeds who had died of fmall-pox, and is alfo fo much ftrengthened by other in- flammatory adions of the veffels of the lkin, as to be ca- pable of demonftration. It was at firft fuppofed that this vafcular

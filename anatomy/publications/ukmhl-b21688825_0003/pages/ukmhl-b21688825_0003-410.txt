3B6 OF THE EARS OF ANIMALS. of the parts enable them to receive a ftronger vibration, and a more perfect and modified found. A cord of a mufical inftrument will vibrate when another in exaÂ£t unifon with it is ftruck. The vibra- tion communicated to the air is fuch, as is adapted to the tenfion of the fympathetic cord ; and no other per- culfion of the air, however violent, will caufe it to found. Again, the air palling through a tube of cer- tain dimenfions, will not communicate to it a motion, nor call forth its found, while the air, palling in equal quantity through a tube of one degree of difference, will rife into a full note. What holds true in regard to the unifon of cords, is alfo true of cylinders, or even of the walls of a paffage or room, a certain note will caufe the refonance of the paffage or room, as a certain vibration will call forth the found of the tube of an organ; becaufe it is in all thefe inltances neceffary that the impulfe be adapted to the pofition of the fur- faces and their powers of reverberation. Sound, as allied to mufic, confilts in the fucceffion, the rythm or time of its return upon the ear. Thefe few fads illuftrate what I mean, by faying, that the various forms of the internal ear of animals, as they advance in the fcale, give additional powers to their organ. In the firll example of the fimple ear, where a* bone vibrates on the expanded nerve, I Ihould conceive that the fenfation were, in confequence of this fimple percuffion, capable of little variety; but in ani- mals where, befides this fimpler mechanifm, there are femicircular canals, and more efpecially in thofe ani- mals, which have dill a further complication of the forms

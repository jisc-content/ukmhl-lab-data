We are now naturally led to the confideration of fome points, the full comprehenfion of which, require the knowledge, both of anatomy and of the principles of optics. V ■ PARALLEL MOTION OF THE EYES. The axis of the eye is a line drawn through the middle of the pupil and of the criftalline lens, and which confequently falls upon the middle of the retina ; and the axis of both eyes produced, are called the optic axis. But the axis of the eyes, it is evident, are * Euclid, and others of the ancients, contended that vifion was occafioned by the emillion of rays from the eye to the object. He thought it more natural to fuppofe, that an animate fubftance gave out an emanation, than that the inanimate body did. In 156s, the opinion was confirmed that the rays entered the eye.—The fenfation was not always believed to be in the retina : It was by fome believed that part of the fenfation was to be attributed to the criftalline. Kepler, in 1600, fhewed, geometrically, how the rays were refradted through all the humors of the eye, fo as to form a diftincl picture on the retina ; and alfo he fliowed the efFedt of glaftes on the eyes.

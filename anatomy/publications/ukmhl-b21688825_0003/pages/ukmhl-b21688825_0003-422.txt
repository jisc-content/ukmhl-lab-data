39^ OF THE ORGAN OF HEARING. with that part of the organ in quadrupeds and in man. The cochlea in birds confifts merely of two cylinders, formed of cartilage, which are united toward their further extremity. While the oppofite extremities di- verge, and while one of thefe cylinders opens into the veftibule, the other opens outward into the cavity of the tympanum *. That which more than any other circumftance dif- tinguifhes the organ of birds from that of animals in- habiting the waters, is the want of the bone or ftony concretion in the facculus veftibuli. . I ,, * We find Mr. Home faying that the cochlea is neither abfolutely neceffary to fit the organ to be impreffed by founds communicated through the air, nor to render it what is termed a miifical ear; and that this is fufficiently proved by that part being wanting in birds, whofe organ is particularly adapted to inarticulate founds. That the cochlea is not neceffary to the communication of found through the atmofphere, we have feen from the examination of the ear of the reptiles. But fince we fee that it forms part of the labyrinth in birds, we may be ltd to doubt Mr. Homeâ€™s conclufion.

OF THE PARTICULAR NERVES, 181 and which attach themfelves to the right epyploic ar- tery, and take a courfe upon the great curvature of the ftomach. Thus the folar or cteliac plexus is a great central net-work of nerves, which pafs out in divifions to the liver, fpleen, pancreas, ftomach, duodenum, and omen- tum. The place and connections of the fuperior mefen- teric plexus is at once known, when it is confidered that it is formed upon the root of the fuperior mefen- teric artery.—It is formed by the caeliac plexus being continued down upon the aorta fo as to involve the root of the mefenteric artery, and by nerves coming over the fide of the vertebras of the loins from the lumbar nerves. This plexus fpreads betwixt the la- mina of the mefentery, and extends upon the branches of the artery, and of courfe is diftributed to the fmall inteftines and part of the colon. It confequently fup- plies the mefenteric glands, and fends nerves alfo to the pancreas, that join thofe which it receives from the fplenic plexus. The fame mefh of nerves, being continued down upon the face of the aorta, furround the lower mefen- teric artery, and follow its branches. This is the lower mefenteric plexus, or mefpcolic plexus; and it is formed in a great meafure from the branches of the continued trunk of the fyinpathetic nerve,—As this plexus fpreads upon the branches of the lower mefen- SUPERIOR MESENTERIC PLEXUS INFERIOR MESENTERIC PLEXUS, teric

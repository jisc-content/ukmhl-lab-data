OF TOUCH AND OF THE SKIN. AJ^ I i 3 the or epidermis; the corpus mucofum, or reticular tiffue; the cutis vera dermis, or true fkin : but from this lad there is feparated a vafcular membrane, below which is the organized furface of the true fkin. The cuticle or epidermis, or scarf skin, is the mod fuperficial lamina of the fkin: it is a tranf- parent and infenfible pelicle which ferves, in fome degree, to refill the impreffion of external bodies on the furface of the body, and, to blunt the other- ways too acute fenfation of the cutis vera. In man it is very thin, unlefs in thofe parts which are expofed to the contact of hard bodies, as the palms of the hands and foies of the feet. The thicknefs of the cutticle there, however, is not altogether the effed of labour and walking, but there is even in the foetus a provifion for the defence of the fkin in thefe places. This is particular, that by labour or continued preffure on the cutticle it does not abrade and become thin and tender, but thicker, harder, and the part more in- fenfible, fo as even to acquire a horny hardnefs and tranf- parency. Of this we have an example in the hands of fmiths, and in a remai kable manner in the feet of thofe who have been acculcomed to walk bare-foot on the burning lands. It is thus a protedion in a date of nature; but when the foot comes to be unnaturally pinched in fhoes, the hard leather works perpetually on a point of the toes, excites the formation of cutticle in the fkin below, which thrown outward by fucceed- ing layers of cutticle, at lad forms a corn or clavus, and which, like a fmall nail, has a broad head with a conical point fnooting into the tender fkin. The cutticle is perforated by the extremities of the perfpiring and abforbing veffels, and by the duds of

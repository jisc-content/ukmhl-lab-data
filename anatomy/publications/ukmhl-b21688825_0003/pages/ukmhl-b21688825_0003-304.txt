280 OF THE RETINA* fpread out on the circumference of the retina; from thefe, the ramifications are fo numerous, that Ruyfch defcribes them as conflicting the membrane *. Cor- refponding with the arteria centralis retinas in the adult, there are veins, the minute extremities of which, after forming connections with the veins of the corona cili- aris, run backwards on the inner furface of the retina in three or four diflinCl branches. Thefe uniting into a trunk, perforate the lamina cribrofa, and become the focia arteriae centralis. Many have been led to believe, that the retina ter- minates forward on the roots of the ciliary proceffes, as others have conceived it to be continued over the fore part of the vitreous humor, and over the furface of the lens f ; but the moll prevalent opinion is, that it terminates on the margin of the lens. That the retina extends over the back of the lens, and receives there the impreffion of light, is very improbable; but that the membrane which fup- ports the retina, is continued over the lens, is demon- flrable. As I have juft faid, the retina, I conceive (with Albinus, M. Ferrein, and others), to confifl of * “ Iteratis perfcrutiniis reperio oculis armatis arteriolarum ex- trema tam efle numerofa & tam ardte fibi invicem et intricate annexa ut peculiarem reprefentent membranulam ex arteriolarum extremis conftitutam, cui connedtetur didla medullofa fubftantia.” Ruyfch Epift. Anat. xiii. p. 15. f Many anatomifts, Window, Cafiobohm, Ferrein, Lieutaud, and Haller, have taught that the retina extends over the great con- vexity of the lens, or that it is inferted into it. Galen believed it to extend over the lens. For an impartial hiftory of opinions, fee Morgagni Epift. Anat. xvii. 47. and Zinn, 114. 2 1 two

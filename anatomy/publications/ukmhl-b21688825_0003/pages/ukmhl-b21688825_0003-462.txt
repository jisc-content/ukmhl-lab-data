OF THE HUMAN EAR. 43 8 is fpread like a fan upon the outer furface of the fac, and has a beautiful fibrous texture; but upon the infide of the fac, upon which it is finally diftributed, it lofes the fibrous appearance. We muff fuppofe its final diflribution to be in filaments fo extremely minute, that we may call it a pulp j though by the term it muff not be underftood that an unorganized matter is meant. That part of the nerve which ftretches to the am- pullae, immediately divides into an opaque white mucous-like expanfion. Beyond thefe ampulla, there has been no expanfion of the nerve difcovered in the membranous tubes. The facculus veftibuli * is fupplied by a portion of the nerve which perforates the macula foraminulofa in the centre of the olfeous excavation, or that which receives into it part of the fac. This part of the nerve is expanded in a foft mucous-like white matter in the bottom and fides of the fac. A divifion of the nerve, as we have already ex- plained, pafles from the meatus auditorius internus through the cribriform bafe of the modiolus into the cochlea. Owing to the circular or fpiral form of the foramina when the nerve is drawn out from the meatus, its extremity appears as if it had taken the impreflion of thefe foramina from the extremities of the torn nerves preferving the fame circular form. Thefe nerves, palling along the modiolus and fcalae cochleae, are in their courfe fubdivided to great mi- * i. e. In oppofition to the facculus tubulorum. nutenefs.

OF THE RETINA. 29; CASE I. OF NYCTALOPIA, OR NIGHT BLINDNESS, BY DR. HEBERDEN. A man, about 30 years old, had, in the fpring, a tertian fever, for which he took too fmall a quantity of bark, fo that the returns of it were weakened with- out being entirely removed; he therefore went into the cold bath, and after bathing twice, he felt no more of his fever. Three days after his lad fit, being then employed on board of a (hip, in the river, he obferved, at fun-fetting, that all obje&s began to look blue, w'hich bluenefs gradually thickened into a cloud, and not long after he became fo blind as hardly to perceive the light of a candle. The next morning, about fun- rife, his fight was reftored as perfectly as ever. When the next night came on, he loft his fight again in the fame manner; and this continued for 12 days and nights. He then came alhore, where the diforder of his eyes gradually abated, and in three days was en- tirely gone. A month after, he went on board of another lhip, and after three days ftay in it the night- blindnefe returned as before, and lafted all the time of his remaining in the fhip, which was nine nights. He then left the lhip, and his blindnefs did not re- turn while he -was upon land. Some little time after- wards, he went into another lhip, in which he continued ten days, during which time the blindnefs returned only two nights, and never afterwards. In the Auguft following, he complained' of lofs of appetite, weaknefs, ftiortnefs of breath, and a cough ; he fell away very faft, had frequent fhiverings, pains X 3 in

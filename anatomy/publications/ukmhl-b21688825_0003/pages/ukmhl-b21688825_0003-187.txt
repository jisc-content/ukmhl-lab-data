OF THE PARTICULAR NERVES. l5l M the VoU. III, the external carotid artery, and forwards under the larger branches of veins in a direction tending towards the os hyoides. Here it turns upwards under the ftylo- hyoideus and digaftricus mufcles, and betwixt the ftylo-gloffus and hyo-gloffus. Where the nerve is near the os hyoides, and palling under the ftylo-gloffus mufcle, it fends down a twig which paffes to the fore part of the throat, and chiefly to the fterno-hyoideus and thyro-hyoideus. The continued nerve is diflributed to the mufcles of the tongue and lower jaw, and glands under the jaw; and it terminates by numerous filaments, which form a net-work amongfl the mufcles of the tongue ; to which is united part of that branch of the fifth pair which goes to the tongue*. The ramus descendens noni paffes downward, and obliquely over the trunk of the carotid artery, and under the thyroid vein. In the fuperfici^l diffedtion of the mufcles of the neck, two (lender twigs of nerves will be feen. to come from the fide of the neck, and eroding the jugular vein, unite to this defeending branch. Thofe twigs come from the fecond and third cervical nervesf; and a little ganglion or plexus is formed by their union with the defeendens noni. From this center are fent out many delicate and fuperficial nerves to the omo-hyoideus and fterno-thyroideus mufcles. Thus we find that the ninth nerve has connexions with the eighth pair of nerves, with the fpinal acceffory, * This has been called plexus cerato-bafio-Jlylo-gloJJus / f In fome inftances thofe twigs are found to be derived from the firft origin of the phrenic nerve.

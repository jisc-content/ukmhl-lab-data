CHOROID COAT AND IRIS. 272- peCled; the fmall quantity of blood *foon coagulated into a dark fpeck, while I expected it fhould have been effufed in rhe aqueous humor. There is a circumflance in the operation of extract- ing the cataradt which I have feen little attended to, and yet It is fufficiently evident. When the cornea has been cut, operators, difappointed in not finding the cataract protruded, keep the eye flaring in the light, and prefs the ball of the eye ; but while the eye is thus expofed to the excitement of the light, the pupil is contracted, and the lens propelled by the aftion of â€¢the mufcles ; and, flill more, by the preffure made on the eye-ball, is in danger of burfling through and tear- ing the iris. The befl operators have been in the cuflom of fhutting the eye-lids the inflant the incifion was made in the cornea ; by this means, the eye is for a time fupported in fome degree during the violent fpafm of the refti mufcles, and the iris being allowed to dilate, the lens is protruded into the anterior cham- ber of the aqueous humor through the pupil, and is ready to flip from under the cut cornea, when the eye-lids are again opened. By this means, if the in- cifion of the cornea is of the proper extent, the lens is not extracted, but is protruded, by the a&ion of the mufcles. of the eye. It is very neceffary for us to remember, that all the parts of the eye in themfelves extremely delicate, are kept in their relative places, not by adhefions, but by the complete fupport they derive from the globular form of the eye, and by the flrength of the outer coat or fclerotic and cornea. To this, it is particularly ne- geffary to attend, in the operation of the extraction of the

In confequence of this fuppuration, there fome- times follows an abfolute obftru&ion of the pupil, from the coalefcing and adhefion of the edges of the iris *. THE VITREOUS HUMOR, The vitreous humor, as already explained, occupies almofl entirely the great ball of the eye. It is con-. fequently beyond the lens, and keeps it at the requifite' diftance, to caufe the rays from objects to concentrate and impinge upon the retina. The vitreous humor is confiderably denfer than the aqueous humor f; but its peculiar appearance, its glairy-like confiftence, is not owing to its denfity, but to the manner in which it is contained in its membranes. From being contained in a cellular ftruCture of perfectly pellucid membranes, it has the adhefion and confiftence of the white of an egg. This membranous ftruCture of the vitreops humor has been demonftrated by acids and by freezing. When frozen, it was found to confift of pieces of ice con- nected by ftrong membranes, which feparated with dif- ficulty, and fhowed their torn fragments ; and M, Demours lifted the tranfparent membranes with the point of a needle. Although the vitreous humor ap- pears to be gelatinous, it is not fo in reality, and when it is taken from the coats of the eye, it retains the fhape for a time, but gradually fubhdes by the fluid exuding * Viz.

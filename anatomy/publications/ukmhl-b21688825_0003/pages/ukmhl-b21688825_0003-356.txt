332 ANATOMY OF THE HUMORS. lens is deprefled—it ought to be withdrawn without again elevating the point. But what has always ap- peared to me as the moll unaccountable caufe that can be affigned for the rifing of the cataract, is the adtion of the mufcles of the eye *. It has been explained how the lens is protruded by the adtion of the mufcles when the cornea is cut and the aqueous humor let out, for then the uniform refiftance of the eye is broken, and there is a motion of the humors towards the breach, and the lens, lying behind the pupil, is the firft part to be protruded forward ; but when it lies under the an- terior part of the vitreous humor (and there it mull lie if it is at all difplaced), or in whatever lituation it hap- pens to be, from that it cannot be moved by the adtion of the redti mufcles; for they embrace the eye on every fide, and their adtion operates uniformly, fo that they cannot effedt a body immerfed in the midll of the hu- mors. For the fame reafon that we Ihould decline the operation of extracting, after attempts have been made to deprefs with the needle, I Ihould refufe when the pupil is rugged and irregular, becaufe the difeafe may be more extenfive than it appears to be. Thus cata- racts brought on by falls, or blows, or pundtures of the eye, are lefs favourable, as there is danger of the inflammation having gone deep, and having affedted the other humors in a wray which cannot be known, fince the opaque lens is betwixt us and them. A frequent caufe of the failqre of the operation of depreflion is the difplacement of the lens backwards $ * See Mr, Benjamin BelJ’g Syftem of Surgery. for

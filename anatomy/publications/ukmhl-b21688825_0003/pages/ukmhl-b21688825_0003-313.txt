An amaurofls fpafmodica has been enumerated by authors. This kind of blindnefs has been fuppofed to arife in con- fequence of the ftri&ure of the optic nerve by the origins of the refti mufcles; as far as I have obferved, no action of thefe mufcles can affect the optic nerve before it per- forates the coats of the eye. If it were to be attributed to the operation of thefe mufcles, I fhould rather fup- pofe it to be occafioned by their fpafmodic aftion on the ball of the eye, by which the function of the retina might be difordered ; but I think it is more probable that the fame irritation which is a&ing on the motatory nerves of the eye, does, in this inftance, affeft alfo the optic nerve and retina. However, diftention of the coats of the eye, by encreafed fecretion of the humors, deflroys the fenfibility of the retina.

From many obfervations, we find that tumors and extravafations, which mult comprefs gradually, do yet produce an inftantaneous effedt. In Bonetus *, we have many cafes of blindnefs from abcefs in the anterior p^rt of the brain ; from fluid on the furface, and in the vem tricles; from fteatomatous tumors ; from coagulum of blood, and from a hydatid preffing on the union of the optic nerves; and, laftly, from a calculus in the optic nerve. Blindnefs from preflure upon the eye and its difplacement, and confequent elongation of the optic nerve, by an encyfted tumor in the orbit, with gradual recovery after operations. See Med.

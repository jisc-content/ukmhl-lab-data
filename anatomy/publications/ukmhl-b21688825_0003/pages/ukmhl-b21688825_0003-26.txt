\ 8 OF THE MEMBRANES OF TftE BRAIN. the difproportionate fize of the brain to the diminutive body. The offification of the bones of the fcull is a, gradual procefs. The brain, already formed, is inverted with the ftrong membranes ; and betwixt the laminae of the outer membrane the points of offification commence* and are not completed until the ninth year. The bony matter, which is depofited betwixt the layers of this membrane, retains a firm connection and interchange of veflels. with the now apparently diftinct membranes on its inner and outer furfaces. The outer layer, which is fo ftrong in children newly born, becomes the delicate pericranium, whilft the inner layer is the dura mater. Thus we find that the bones of the head are moulded to the brain, and the peculiar fhapes of the bones of the. head are determined by the original peculiarity in the fhape of the brain. This view corrects an error into which many have, fallen, that the dura mater and the veflels ramifying upon it imprefs their form upon the folid bones, and wear channels upon their furface by their inceflant pul-, fation. The membranes and veflels precede the forma-, tion of the bone, and the ofleous matter is depofited fo as to be moulded round the veflels *. Thus the dura mater may be confidered as the inter- nal pericranium f. * Albini Acad.

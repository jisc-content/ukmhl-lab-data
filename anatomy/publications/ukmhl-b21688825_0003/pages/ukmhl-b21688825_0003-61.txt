OF THE VEINS OF THE BRAIN. 41 twixt the extremities of the arteries and the veins of thebrain *. The defcription of the veins of the brain, previous to their entering the finus, has been negle&ed. I divide them into the external and internal veins of the brain, or thofe which emerge from its fubftance, and are feen upon the furface; and thofe which, coming chiefly from the fides of the ventricles, are convoluted in the plexus choroides, and terminate in the fourth finus. OF THE VEINS WHICH ARE SEEN UPON THE SURFACE OF THE BRAIN. Vicq d’Azyr has been minute in his attention to the veins of the furface of the brain. He confirmed the obfervation, that almoft all the veins which pafs into the longitudinal finus, open in a direction contrary to the ilream of blood in the finus f. Thefe fuper- ficial * The obfervation is trivial; bat we mull recoiled!:, that Vefa- lius contradided Galen, and affirmed, that the finufes received alfo arteries which gave them their pulfation. This opinion was refuted by Fallopiits, but adopted by Vieuffens, Wepfer, and others, upon the idea of the facility with which injedion palfes from the arteries into the finufes ; while, on the other hand, Ruyfch conceived that the cortical part of the brain confided entirely of arteries. •j- From Vicq d’Azyr’s table we fhould be led to conclude, that the veins did not decidedly all open with their mouths oppofed to the dream of blood. Ridley afferts, that one half open backwards. Santorini alfo obferves great variation in the diredlion of thefe veins. Lower, while he obferved this diredlion backwards, de- fcribes them, at the fame time, as palling obliquely betwixt the coats, like the gall dud in the intedine, or the ureters into the blad- der.

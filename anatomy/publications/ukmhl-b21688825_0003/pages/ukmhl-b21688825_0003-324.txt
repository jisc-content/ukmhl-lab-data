£00 OF THE RETINA. Boerhaave gives us an example of imperfed vifion, from a difcordance betwixt the contra&ion of the iris and the excitement of the retina; fo that the pupil did not dilate in proportion to the decay of light *. When inflammation extends within the eye, or when the retina is excited by fympathy with the opthalmia of the outer membranes, it may happen that the patient is totally blind during the day, and yet fees on the ap- proach of evening ; becaufe, from the fenfibility of the retina, the pupil is abfolutely fhut, but as the light is diminifhed the pupil is gradually relaxed, and the ob- fcure light admitted, and this obfcure light, from the irritable {late of the retina, gives a vivid fenfation in- comprehenfible to the byftanders. Our judgments of the flrength of fenfations are comparative merely; when we have been accuftomed to flrong imprefiions, lefler ones are difregarded. • The greater light deftroys the capacity of the retina for receiving {lighter and more delicate impreflions; while, on the other hand, the abfence of light referves to us the power of feeing objefts the moft faintly illuminated. We are every day becoming more acquainted with the inviflble pro- perties of light; and we have frequent experience of darknefs being relative, and that what we fhould call total darknefs is very often but a fainter light. One man will fee diflindbly, when another is quite deprived of the power of dicerning objects. A man in prifon feems to have the light gradually admitted to him ; and * In old people there !s an obfcurity of vifion, from a diminifh- ed fenfibility of the retina; and the iris does not take a quick fuc- ceflicn of contraftion and dilatation with the change of light. many

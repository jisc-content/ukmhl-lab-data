OF THE RETINA. 283 DIGRESSION ON THE SEAT OF VISION. M. L’Abbe Mariotte difcovered the curious fad, that when the rays fall upon the centre of the optic nerve, ' they give no fenfation. He defcribes his experiment in this manner :—“ Having often obferved, in diffec- tions of men as well as of brutes, that the optic nerve does never anfvver juft to the middle of the bottom of the eye; that is, to the place where the pidure of the ob- jed we look diredly upon is made ; and that, in man, it Is fomewhat higher, and on the fide towards the nofe ; to make, therefore, the rays of an objed to fall upon the optic nerve of my eye, and to find the confequence thereof I made this experiment. I faftened on an ob- fcure wall, about the height of my eye, a fmall round paper, to ferve me for a fixed point of vifion; I faf- tened fuch another on the fide thereof towards my right hand, at the diftance of about two feet, but fome- what lower than the firft, to the end that I might firike the optic nerve of my right eye while I kept my left fhut. Then I placed myfelf over againft the firft paper and drew back by little and little, keeping my right eye fixed and very fteady upon the fame, and being about ten feet diftant, the fecond paper totally dif- appeared This defed in the vifion of the one eye is correded by that of the other ; for the inferdon of the optic ' nerves being towards the fide next the nofe, no part of an image can ever fall on the optic nerve of both eyes * Vid, Phil.

OF THE HUMAN EAR. 42 7 fuperior and pofterior femicircular canal. It has paffed, then, along the pofterior canal. The two openings of the exterior or horizontal canal are upon the back part of the veltibule; and the canal itfelf takes a circle which brings its convexity to the confines of the maf- ,toid cells. Thefe canals are formed of a very hard brittle bone, their caliber is fo frnall as not to admit the head of a common pin ; they form fomewhat more than a half circle; and of each of them, one of the extremities is enlarged like the ampulula of fifties, Valfalva imagined that the enlarged extremities of thefe tubes were trumpet-like, to concentrate and flrengthen weak founds. We ftiall find, on the contrary, that there is in the human ear, as in fifties, a particular expanfion of the nerve in thefe extremities of the tube, oppofed to the circulatory vibration of the fluids in the canals. The cochlea. The third, divifion of the labyrinth is the cochlea. It is fo named from its refemblance to the fliell of a fnail, or from the manner in which its fpiral lamina turn round a centre like a hanging flair. It has been minutely, but not fimply, defcribed ; and, indeed, there can be nothing more difficult, than to defcribe it in words. When the os petrofum is cut from around the coch- lea, it is feen to be of a pyramidal fhape, and to con- fin: of a fcroll, making large circles at the bafe, and gradually leffer ones towards the apex. It is formed in the moll anterior part of the petrous bone, and has its apex turned a little downward and outward; and the bafe is oppofed to the great cul de fac of the inter- nal meatus auditorius, F f 4 The

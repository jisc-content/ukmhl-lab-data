.OF THE PARTICULAR NERVES. 1S3 it. This plexus is thrown over the velfels of the kid- ney, and forms feveral little ganglions. From the Venal plexus defcends the spermatic plexus. This plexus of nerves in woman follows the fpermatic artery in its diftribution to the ovaria and uterus. In pafiing down upon the loins * the 1 fympathetic nerve forms five or fix ganglions with the branches from the lumbar nerves. Thefe are oblong, angular, ftellated—irregular in their form, as in their number, fituation, fize, or the twigs which, in their union with the fympathetic, form them. Betwixt thefe ganglions or connections with the lumbar nerves, the fympathetic is not always one nerve, but is fometimes fplit into feveral finaller nerves, which unite again. From the fympathetic nerves 6f either fide we have to obferve frequent interchange of branches, which fometimes attach themfelves to the lumbar nerves, fometimes creep under the aorta, or unite to the plextls covering the face of the aorta.—There are feveral little gang- lions formed by thefe nerves upon the face of the lum- bar vertebras they have the name of ganglia ac- ceiforia. Before the fympathetic tierve defcerids into the pel- vis, it has become extremely delicate. In many fub- jeCts it feems to terminate in tile laft lumbar, or firfl facral nerve j but, upon more minute dilfeCtion, leflfer branches will be found to defeend amongft the loofe cellular fubftance of the pelvis.—When regular, or perhaps we may fay with truth when regularly and fully ditfedted, the fympathetic nerves of each fide are fsen to defeend upon the fore part of the facrum, and N 4 form

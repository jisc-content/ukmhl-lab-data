OF THE HUMORS OF THE EYE. 3Â°9 CHAP. VII. OF THE HUMORS OF THE EYE. OF THE AQUEOUS HUMOR.. TttB aqueous humor is perfectly limpid* It has no capfule or furrounding membrane, as it is not in con- fidence allied to the other humors, but is fluid *. The ufe which I have alligned to the aqueous humor ex* plains its nature and the extent of the chamber which contains it, viz. that it diftends the Cornea and allows the free motion of the iris; it confequently fills the fpace between the lens and cornea. The ufual defcrip- tion is, that it is lodged in two chambers; the one be- fore the iris, called the anterior chamber of the aqueous humor, and the other behind the iris, called the pollerior chamber of the aqueous humor. This pofterior chamber was, at one time, conceived to be of great extent t, and authors fpoke of deprefling the lens into the pofterior chamber of the aqueous humor * It pofTefles, however, a degree of vifcidity.

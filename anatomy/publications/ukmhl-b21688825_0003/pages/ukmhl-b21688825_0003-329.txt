OF THE MEMBRANA PUPILLARIS. 305 veffels of the cryflalline, he alfo firft obferved the mem- brane which clofes the pupil, and in which the veffels were injeCted that came from the margin of the pupil. Upon looking through the cornea, he could fee no dif- tinCfion of parts, but all feemed vafcularity. He con- ceived, at firft, that thefe were the veffels of the uvea, and that it had quite contracted and had fhut the pupil; then that they were the veffels of the capfule of the cryftalline lens; but having cut into the eye, he found it to be this membrane. Dr. Hunter, fpealdng of this membrane, and of Aibinus’s claim to the difcovery, fays, “ In juftice to this great anatomift, I muft declare that I believe this, both becaufe he afferts it and becaufe I know from the circumftances it was hardly poflible he could mifs taking notice of it in that child.” “ I have always obferved (he continues), both in the human body and in the quadruped, that there is a great re- femblance to one another in the veffels of the capfula criftallini and of the membrana pupillae. In an injeCted foetus, I always find both nearly in the fame ftate : if one be filled only with the blood that is drove before the injedion, fo is the other; if one be filled partly with injection, and partly with blood, the other is in, the fame condition; if one, by good fortune, be finely and minutely filled by injeCtion, the other is fo too ; if one be burft by extravafations, the other is commonly in the fame ftate ; and when the foetus is fo near its full time that the one cannot be injeCted, neither can the other*.” * See Medical Commentaries, p. 63. foot nots.

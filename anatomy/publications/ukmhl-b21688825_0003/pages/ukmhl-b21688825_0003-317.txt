OF THE RETINA. 293 in which it moved before ; from which miftake, with refpedt to the motion of the eye, the objects at red will appear to move the fame way the objects are ima- gined to move, and, confequently, will feem to con- tinue their motion for fome time after the eye is at reft. How fuperior is fimple experiment to the moft ingenious fpeculation ! Dr. Porterfield is prefuming in all this, that the eye is at reft v/hen the body is fta- tionary, after turning round rapidly on one foot. But the faÂ£t is, that the eyes continue in motion after the body is at reft, but owing to a diforder in the fyftem of fenfation we are not fenftble of it. Dr. Wells, in making an experiment, in which it was neceffary to look upon a luminous body, was feized with giddinefs, and he found, that the fpot on the retina, a'ffe&ed by the great excitement of the luminous body, did not re- main ftationary, but, when made apparent by looking upon the wall or any plane, was moved in a manner altogether different from'what he conceived to be the direction of his eyes. In making the experiment after looking fome time at a candle, and then turning him- felf round till he became giddy, he afterwards directed his eyes to the middle of a fheet of paper, he faw the dark fpot (caufed by the former brilliancy of the can- dle on the retina) take a courfe over the paper, al- though he conceived that the portion of his eyes re-, mained ftationary. He then diredfed a perfon to re- peat this experiment, and then bade him look ftead- faftly to him, and keep his eyes fixed ; but inftead of keeping ftationary, his eyes were feen to move in their focket; though, of this, the perfon himfelf was quite infenfible.

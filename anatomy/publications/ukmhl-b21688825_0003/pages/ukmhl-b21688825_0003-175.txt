OF THE PARTICULAR NERVES. I49 cuius is the auditory nerve, and is diftributed to the or- gan within the pars petrofa of the temporal bone ; and in diltindtion it is called the portio mollis. The portio dura, or nervus communicans fa- ciei, in palling from the brain to the internal auditory foramen, is lodged in the fore part of the auditory nerve, as in a groove. When it leaves the auditory nerve, it paffes on through the bone, and emerges on the fide of the face through the ftylo-maftoid foramen at the root of the ftyloid procefs, fo as to come out juft under the tip of the ear, covered, of courfe, by the parotid gland. The portio dura, while palling through the canal of the temporal bone (which is the aqueduct of Falopius), gives off a branch which unites with the vidian nerve of the fifth pair ; or rather, we may con- clude with the belt authors, that it receives a branch which comes retrograde from the vidian nerve, palling through the fmall hole on the anterior furface of the petrous part of the temporal bone. The portio dura, when it has proceeded onwards by the fide of the tym- panum, gives off one or more very minute branches to the mufcles within the tympanum, which give tenfion to the fmall bones of the ear. A little further on, this nerve gives off a more remarkable branch, which, palling acrofs the tympanum, is called corda tym- pani. This is the branch which, as we formerly mentioned, joins the guftatory branch of the lower maxillary nerve. The corda tympani paffes through the tympanum betwixt the long procefs of the incus and the handle of the maleus; then, received into a groove of the bone, it paffes by the fide of the curta- il 3 chean

THE ORIGIN OF THE NERVES. I25 four portions which pafs to the feveral parts of the inter- nal ear. The latter pafles through the ear, and comes out by the ftylo-mafloid foramen behind the ear, fpreads upon the cheek, and forms the principal nerve of the face. EIGHTH PAIR OF NERVES. To underhand a very intricate demonhration, it is neceffary to recolledl that the eighth pair of nerves, as they have a relation to the brain, confifts of three dis- tinct nerves.—Thefe are, ift, The glosso-pharyn- gial nerve ; 2d, The par vagum ; 3d, The SPINAL accessory.—Taken all together, they arife from the fuperior and lateral part of the medulla oblongata. The glosso-pharyngial nerve is only diftin- guifhed within the fcull as a larger filament of the eighth pair ; it is however difliiidl in its courfe from the origin to the point where it pierces the dura mater : it is the uppermoft of the fibres of this .pair of nerves.— Sometimes there is a very delicate filament running pa- rallel with its lower edge which belongs to it. It has the fame origin with the fibres of the par vagum *. The par vagum is compofed of ten or twelve very fmall filaments, which are fometimes united into three or four fafciculi. Thefe filaments arife from the outer * “ Nervus gloffo-pharyngeus fafciculo mox una, mox duabus, “ quatuor, quinque fibris compofito oritur ex fumma atque priore “ parte medulla; fpinae pone corpora olivaria nervum facialem inter “ atque nervum vagum, nonnunquam etiam ex quarto ventriculo vel ex cruribus cerebelli ad fpinse medullam, nonnunquam fub pofleriori “ fulco nervi vagi, dedu&us ab eo vel diftindius, vel obfcurius in- “ terpofita arteria, vel vena, vel arteria et vena fimul, vel parte tl plexus choreoidis, quid quod ipfa diredione a nervo vago ell di- Hindus.” Soemmerring. border

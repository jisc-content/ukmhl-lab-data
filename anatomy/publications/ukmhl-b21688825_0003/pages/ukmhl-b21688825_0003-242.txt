OF THE SENSES. 2iS natural, and by no means unpleafant: It is the exer- tion of the faculty of the mind. But it may become difeafe; for health confifts in the due correfpondence betwixt the excitement and the vigorous adtion of the body, and the operation of the mind when roufed by the externai fenfes. The mind (united to the body) fuffers in the difeafes of the body. In the debility of the body, ii> fever, in fpafms, and pain, the faculties of the mind languifh, or are rouied to unequal flrength or morbid acutenefs. Sometimes the phantafms and internal fenfations of things once received by the outward fenfes, become fo ftrong in the mind, as to be miftaken for objects actually prefent. Such phrenzy or delirium arifes from a difordered and acutely fenfible flate of the in- ternal fenfes. Thefe impreflions being great in degree, hurry and buftle are in the countenance of the patient, and uncommon flrength and violence in his adions; as paflion gives uncommon excitement to one in health, with a difregard or forgetfulnefs of all other things. In health, however vigorous the force of imagination may be, there iยง flill a convi&ion that the ideas which it prefents are not realities, and the operation of the exter- nal fenfes preponderates in recalling the attention to what exifts around us. But when the internal per- ceptions become fo ftrong as to be miftaken for realties, the effect is falfely attributed to the organs. It indeed fometimes happens, that this falfe perception is really oyring to difeafe in the organ; while it alfo occurs, that a too vivid perception of things abfent proceeds from an affe&ion of the brain, and not of the outward fenfes.

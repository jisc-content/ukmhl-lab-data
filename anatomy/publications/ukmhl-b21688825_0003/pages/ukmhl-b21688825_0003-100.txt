74 OF THE VENTRICLES OF THE ER'aInI alfo as forming convolutions; but they are chiefly medullary, and are more irregular, or rather have a greater variety of fliape, than thofe of the outer fur- face. In regard to the ufe of the ventricles of the brain, fince the hypothefes of the older phyficians have been tacitly rejected, no opinion has been offered, except this, that “ they feem to be made of a neceflary con- “ fequence, and towards the greater ufe and diflinftion “ of partsor, as we have already had occafion to mention, that the ventricles ferve to increafe the fur- face of the pia mater, and that whatever may be the purpofes which are ferved by that membrane on the furface of the brain, we mull fuppofe the fame to be per- formed by it within the ventricles. But this is a con- clufion which may not be altogether fatisfaftory to an inquifitive mind. It is neceflary to take into confideration the general peculiarities of the brgm : we find that within the fcull there is no adipofe fubftance, though it pervades every other part of the body. We at once fee a reafon for this. It is evident that as the fat is fo inceffantly un- dergoing changes (being alternately abforbed and de- pofited) ; as at one time it is depofited in greater quan- tities and at another abforbed; as it is in perpetual varia- tion according to the prevailing habits of the body, the proportion of exercife taken, or the flate of the health; its continual changes would have the very worfl confe- quence upon fuch a part as the brain j that if accumu- lated it would opprefs the circulating veflfels; if rapidly -abforbed it would be followed by accumulation or furcharge of the veflfels; for the feull does not allow

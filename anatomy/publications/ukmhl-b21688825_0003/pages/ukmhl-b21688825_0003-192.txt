166 OF THE PARTICULAR NERVES. The firft goes to form, with the third and fifth cer- vical nerves, the phrenic nerve. It fends alfo a branch to the fympathetic, to the integuments of the neck and Ihoulder, and to the fupra and infra fpinatus mufcles. Thefe are called by Soemmerring supercla- viculares interiores, medii, and posteriores. The great posterior division of the fourth cer- vical nerve, pafies to the mufcles of the fpine and Ihoul- der, in conjun&ion with the branches of the third cervical nerve. Fifth cervical nerve.—This nerve comes of courfe from betwixt the fourth and fifth vertebrae, and from betwixt the fcaleni mufcles. It divides alfo into two branches. The superior of thefe pafies back- wards to the mufcles of the back and fhoulder, and a branch formed by it; and the fixth pafies down under the fcapula and ferratus major. This fuperior divifion of the nerve fends up alfo two fmall twigs of communi- cation with the fourth cervical nerve. The inferior division of the nerve fends down upon the fide of the neck a confiderable branch to the for- mation of the phrenic nerve. It communicates with the root of the fixth nerve, and fends mufcular branches backward. The sixth cervical nerve.-—'The mufcular branches of this nerve are large and extenfive in their courfe. They pafs into the levator fcapulae, extend under the trapezius, and unite with the extreme branches of the fpinal acceffory nerve. They are pro- longed to the latiflimus dorfi and ferratus magnus. Branches alfo extend down behind the clavicle, and under the pe&oral mufcle. Befides

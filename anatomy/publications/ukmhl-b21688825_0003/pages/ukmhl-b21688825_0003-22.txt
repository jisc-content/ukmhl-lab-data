INTRODUCTORY VIEW 4 fubdance, confiding like the brain of a cineritious and medullary matter, is nouriflied by thefe membranes.* We mud conclude alfo, that they are more independent of the brain than the brain is of them ; for the nerves are capable of continuing the operations of the animal body independently of the brain ; but without the com- munication of fenfation through the nerves to the brain., its function mud be unexercifed. The nerves, in their courfe'through the body, form ganglions, plexus, and networks. By thefe a more univerlal connexion of the leveral branches of the fyl- tem is maintained, fo that few' if any nerves can be traced to one point or origin. When the nerves form ganglions, (which are like knots or fwellings upon them,) their fibres are fplit and irregularly difperfed, while there intervenes a peculiar fubdance refembling the drias of the 'cineritious fubdance in the, brain. From every analogy we mud iuppofe, that thofe gan- glions anfwer in a 1 els, degree the purpofe of that more univerfal connection which the nerves have with the brain. In their extremities again the nerves are peculiarly organized: a nerve, in its uourie, is incapable of receiv- ing any diilinCt fenfation; when injured, it conveys to us the undefinable fenfation of pain; and from the con- nection with the mufcles, and with the whole fydem, it fhakes the limb with involuntary tremors, or hidden fpafms. The fufceptibiiity of thofe peculiar impreilions which the organs of the ienfes convey, depends upon a druCture didinCt from that of the brain, and didipct alfo from that of the nervous cords; an4 this organization is fo peculiar, that the nerves of one fenfe are quite inca- pable

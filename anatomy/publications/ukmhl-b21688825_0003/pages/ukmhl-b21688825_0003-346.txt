322 OF THE CENTRAL ARTERlf. the artery at the root of the optic nerve, I found a let of veflels injected on the furface of the retina quite diftin£l from the turgid veins, and which could be no other than the arteries diftributed to the retina. I mull conclude that there is no peculiarity in the diflribution of veflels in the tunica vafculofa retinae. We frequently obferve, that the trunks of veins and arteries, dellined to the fame final diflribution, take a different courfe ; but in their final diflribution, I know no inflance in which they do not ramify with parallel branches interwoven with each other. The vena centralis retina, as it is defcribed by Haller, is fometimes a branch of the opthalmica cerebralis, but often it rifes from the cavernous finus, amongft the origins of the external and inferior refti mufcles of the eye ; after giving off many fmall twigs to the periofteum and fat of the orbit, it paffes obliquely from behind, forward, and inward, perforates the fheath of the optic nerve, and, after fupplying the fheath, dips into the furface of the nerve.—It is now the comes ar- terial centralis retinae. It enters through the cribriform plate of the optic nerve, and fpreading generally in large and remarkable branches on the retina, thefe make free inofculations with each other, and finally inofculate with the veins of the ciliary proceffes. Whether a branch of the vena centralis retinae is fent off to accompany the branch of the artery which takes its courfe through the vitreous humor, I have not been able to determine. I

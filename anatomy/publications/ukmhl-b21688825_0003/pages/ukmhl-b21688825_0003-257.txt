OF THE EYE. 233 2. The lens or christalline humor is placed immediately behind the perforation in the iris; which perforation is called the pupil. The lens colledts the rays of light like a double convex glafs, fo as to con- centrate them, and make a more forcible image on the bottom of the eye. 3. The vitrious humor is behind the lens. It diftends the general ball of the eye into a regular fphere, that it may move eafily in the orbit; and its diameter in the axis of the eye is fo proportioned to the focal diftance of the lens, (affedted alfo in fome degree by the other humors), that the image of an ebjedt is formed accurately on the furface of the retina : accordingly, when the coats are cut from the back of the eye, the pidture of a luminous object held before the pupil is feen exquifitely minute and diftindt on the bottom of the eye. While thefe humors have each its dilHnct charac- ter, they poffefs, in proportion to their denfity, diffe- rent powers of refracting the rays of light. This has the (till farther good effedt of correcting the aberration of the rays and giving the trueft colours, as well as the moft corredt image of the objedt prefented to the eye. If the lucid anterior part of the eye be formed too prominent, or if the lens of the eye have too great a degree of convexity, or, laftly, if the fize of the ball cf the eye, and the diameter of the vitrious humor in the axis of the eye be unufually great, then the pe rfon does not fee diftindtly; becaufe the powers of the humors, in concentrating the rays of light, are too great, and the image of the objedt is not formed ac- R 3 curately

76 OF THE VENTRICLES OF THE BRAIN. The effeft of the difeafe is, that there is a change in the relative powers which inceffantly fecrete and abforb the brain itfelf, as every other part of the body is fe- creted and abforbed. And in confequence of this there is a diminution of the folids of the brain, and an accumulation of the fluids to fupply their lofs. It is not to be fuppofed that the ancients, fo fertile in their hypothefes, and fo eafy in their proofs, could negledl the evident importance of the ventricles of the brain. We accordingly find that the fpirits were ma- nufadlured in thefe cavities; that they were the “ fpi- “ rituum animalium officina,” whence the fpirits were conveyed over all the nervous fyftem *. They were again degraded from this higher office, and became the mere receptacles of the excrementitious matter of the brain (meras cloacas efle afleruerint f) ; and Willis feems inclined ftill further to degrade the importance of the ventricles, by confidering them merely as of fecondary importance; or rather as refulting folely from the accidental conformation of the brain J. Again we find it a prevalent opinion that the ventri- * Lately, by chemical aids, (which makes the cineritious'fubfiance black, or dark brown, while the medullary matter remains white, or takes a flight greenifh tinge,) the origins of many of the nerves have been traced into the fubflance of the brain, even tothe furface of the ventricles, which has given occafion to the revival of fimilar ideas of the ufe of the ventricles.

Such an arrangement of fibres can “ be accounted for on no other fuppofition than that “ of mufcularity. The mafs is inclofed in a flrong <c membranous capfule, to which it is loofely connedted <c by minute veffels and nerves; and the connection is <£ more obfervable near its greatefl circumference. <c Between the mafs and its capfule is found a con- <c fiderable quantity of an aqueous fluid, the liquid “ of the criflalline.” « Suppofmg that thefe are mufcular fibres, from their clofenefs and direction, they would ftand acknowledged as forming the ftrongeft and molt powerful mufcle of its fize in the whole body ; yet they adt only on them- felves, wrhich requires the leafl poffible degree of power. Again, how are they relaxed ? What power is their antagonift ? Mr. Young demonftrates not only the mufcular

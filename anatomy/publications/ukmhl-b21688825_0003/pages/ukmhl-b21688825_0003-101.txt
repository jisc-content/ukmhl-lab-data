OF THE VENTRICLES OF THE BRAIN. J 5 of diftention, nor is it poflible that it can admit of depletion. I conceive the ventricles to be a provifion for allow- ing thofe changes to take place, which neceflarily, from time to time, arife, or are occafioned by difeafe in the fubftance of the brain itfelf: they prevent an inftantaneous bad effetft. When fluids diftend the ven- tricles, it fometimes occurs to us that the fluid, fe- creted and accumulated, mull have comprefled the fubftance of the brain, and caufed its abforption ; but I conceive that frequently the caufe is reverfed ; the abforption of the mafs of the brain being the difeafe or its confequence, and the fluid being poured out in. the ventricles to fupply this deficiency : I alfo con- ceive that the collected fluid being in the central parts, is a particular provifion by which the whole mafs of the brain is kept uniformly diftended; whereas, if the furface had been equally, or more difpofed to fuch fecretion of fluid, the internal parts would have fallen flaccid, and been comprefled rather than fup- There cannot be^a more erroneous notion than that in Hydrocephalus the comprefiion produced by the fecreted fluid occafions the wafting of the brain. In that difeafe the fubftance of the brain is not firm and comprefled, fo as to prevent the veins from being completely filled ; but, even in a very early ftage, the mafs of the brain is foft and fluid ; the veins peculiarly diftended or enlarged ; and from the firft or inflamma- tory ftage of the acute hydrocephalus, or the perma- nent ftate of the chronic, the difeafe is not a dropfy pf the ventricles, but a univerfal affe&ion of the brain.

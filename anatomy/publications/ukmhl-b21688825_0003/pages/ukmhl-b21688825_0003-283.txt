OF THE COATS OF THE EYE. 259 ftrise retinae fubjefbe ligamento ciliari I have called this impreffion halo signatus, becaufe it is formed of a circle of radiations, formed by the impreffion of the ciliary proceffes, and is not peculiar to the re- tina, but the retina again makes its impreffion on the membrane of .the vitreous humor. The furrows and doublings of the anterior part of the retina, formed by the impreffion of the ciliary proceffes, Dr. Monro has called the ciliary proceffes of the retina ; but, for my part, I think this a term likely to confound and mifiead a ftudent; and we might as well fpeak of the ciliary pro- ceffes of the vitreous humor, or of the membrane of the vitreous humor, fince they alfo take the impreffion of the ciliary proceffes f. When the vitreous humor and lens are taken out of the coats, we fee alfo that the ciliary proceffes have left the ftain of the fuliginous paint §. This it is necef- fary to remark, fince I have feen ffudents confound this mark with the ciliary proceffes themfelves. The ciliary proceffes are of a moll elegant vafcular fti uc- ture. Their contorted arteries are beautifully repre- fented in Zinn’s figure. He traces them from the ex- * Fafcie vii. Icon. ocul. f Window ufes the term fulci ciliarej, for the impreffion on the various humor. Zin-n calls this corona ciliaris, after Camper: he sieferibes them well, p. 75. § See Morgagni Eplft.

OF THE VENTRICLES OF THE BRAIN. Ill he calls it CORPUS DENTATUM EMMrNENTIJE OLI« VARIS. MEDULLA SPINALIS. The medulla fpinalis, from its ftrudure, its two fub- ftances, its membranes, and its ufe, as evident in the con- fequences of injury, mull be confidered as an elongation 'of the brain. Its name implies its fituation contained within the tube of the fpine. Though chiefly compofed of medullary matter, it is not entirely fo j for there is an irregular,central, cortical fubftance, through its whole extent, having fomething of a crucial form in the fe&ion of this part *. There are continued down from the ca- lamus Icriptorius behind, and the rima, formed by the porpora pyramidalia, before, two fiflures which divide the fpinal marrow into lateral portions. On the back part, however, the fiffure is very little diftinguifhable. Into the anterior one the little veflfels penetrate to fupply the cineritious matter with blood. The fpinal marrow dimi- nilhes in thicknefs as it defcends in the neck; but below the giving off of the brachial plexus it again enlarges, then continues gradually to diminifti. The tube of the vertebras is conne&ed by a ftrong li- gamentous (heath, which runs down the whole length within the tube. The dura mater, after lining the in- ternal furface of the cranium, goes out by the great foramen, and forms a kind of funnel $ at the occipital .. - 7 * The furface of the fpinal marrow hasalfo been obfervedto be of a darker colour, and in large animals diftin&ly cineritious.

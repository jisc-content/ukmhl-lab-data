OF THE RETINA. 3°2 This appearance grew fainter, and lefs frequent by de- grees, fo that now there are feldom any remains of it. But fome other very fenfible effedts of this hurt ftill remain:—For, firft, the fight of the right eye continues to be more dim than that of the left; fecondly, the neareft limit of diftindt vifion is more remote in the right eye than in the other, although, before the time mentioned, they were equal in both thefe refpedts, as I had found by many trials; but, thirdly, what I chiefly intend to mention is, that a ftraight line, in fome cir- cumftances, appears to the right eye to have a curvature in it. Thus, when I look upon a mufick book, and, fhutting my left eye, diredt the right to a point of the middle line of the five which compofe the ftaff of mu- fick, the middle line appear dim indeed at the point to which the eye is directed, but ftraight; at the fame time the two lines above it and the two below it appear to be bent outwards, and to be more diftindt from each other, and from the middle line than at other parts of the ftaff to which the eye is not diredted. Fourthly, although I have repeated this experiment times innu- merable within thefe 16 months, I do not find that cuftom and experience takes away this appearance of curvature in ftraight lines. Laftly, this appearance of curvature is perceptible when I look with the right eye only, but not when I look with both eyes; yet I fee better with both eyes together than even with the left eye alone.” Herfchel, in making his obfervations on the fun, found the irritation proceeding from the red rays (being thofe of the rays of light which have the property of producing heat in the greateft degree) j he found, when q he

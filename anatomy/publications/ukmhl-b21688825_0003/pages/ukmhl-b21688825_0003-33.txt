The firfl proceeding from the opthalmic and ethmoidal branches; the fecond from the internal maxillary and luperior pharyngeal; the pofterior from the occipital and vertebral arteries. The principal artery of the dura mater, named, by way of diftinftion, the great artery of the dura mater, is derived from the internal maxillary artery, a branch of the external carotid. It is called the fpinalis, or fpheno-fpinalis, horn its palling into the head through the fpinous hole of the fphenoid bone, or meningea media, from its relative fituation, as it rifes in the great middle fofla of the fcull *. This artery, though it fometimes enters the fcull in two branches f, ufually enters in one confiderable branch, and divides foon after it reaches the dura mater into three or fourbranches, of which the anterior is the largefl; and thefe fpread their ramifications beautifully upon the dura mater, over all that part which is oppofite to the anterior, middle, and poflerior lobes of the brain. Its larger trunks run upon the internal furface of the parietal bone, and are fome- times for a confiderable fpace buried in its fubflance. The extreme branches of this artery extend fo as to inofculate with the anterior and poflerior arteries of the * Malacarne, parte i. fee. ioo. f Soemmerring de Corp. Hum. fab. tom. v. p. 142. This is not the foie artery fent to the dura mater from the internal maxillary, a twig alfo rifes from that branch which goes to the pteregoid mufcles and parts about the Euftachian tube—it enters the fcull, and is dif- tributed to the 5th pair of nerves, and to the dura mater and caver- nous finus. Another enters with the inferior maxillary nerve by the foramen ovale, and rifes upon the dura mater. dura

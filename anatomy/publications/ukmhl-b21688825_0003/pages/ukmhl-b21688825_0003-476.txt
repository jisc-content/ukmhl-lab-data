452 DISEASES OF THE INTERNAL EAR* nution of the morbid fenfibility of the brain*. But the fur- charge of the veflfels of the brain or of the auditory nerve will alfo produce deafnefs and unufual fenfations in the ear : as in fuppreflion of the menfes and haemorrhoids* in furfeit, &c. in which cafes it is often preceded by vertigo and head-ach. There occurs a very curious inftance of analogy betwixt the ears and eyes in the following cafes :— <c A certain eminent mufician, when he blew the Ger- man flute, perceived at the fame time the proper found of it and another found of the fame rythm or meafure, but of a different tone. His hearing feemed thus to be doubled. It was not an echo ; for he heard both founds at one and the fame moment: neither were the founds accordant and harmonious, for that would have been fweet and pleafant to his ear. Having for feveral days perfifted in his attempts, and always been fliocked with this grating found, he at lafl: threw his flute afide. The day before the firfl; became fenfible of this ftrange affec- tion, he had imprudently walked in a very cold and damp evening, and was feized with a catarrh in the right fide- Whence, probably, it arofe that the natural tone of that ear was altered: the found appeared more grave, and diffonant from that received by the left ear. Having recovered from the catarrh, the diftind hearing of hii ear was reftored.” * But the difficulty of knowing when the deafnefs is the refult of difeafe, or malconformation in the parts tranfmitting the found to the nerve, and when in the brain and nerve, has led to more uncer- tainty and confufian with regard to the fpecies and varieties of the diforders of the ear than in the eye j where the tranfparency «f the humors affilt in the definition.

3^0 OF THE SECRETION OF TEARS. their conveyance towards the inner cantinas, in the in-' clination of the tarfus to each other; for the eye-lids meet only on the outer edge of the broad furface form- ed by the tarfus, the confequence of which is, that a kind of gutter is formed in the angle by the inner edges of the tarfus not meeting, which leads the tears from the ducts of the lachrymal gland towards the punCta' lachrymalia. The puncta lachrymalia are the mouths of two ducts which form the beginning of a canal for drawing off the tears from the eye into the nofe. Thefe puncta" are placed at the inner canthus of the eye, and on the termination of the tarfus of the upper and under eye- lid : they are furrounded by a rigid fubftance; and their patent mouths abforb by capillary attraction. They lead the tears into the lachrymal fac, and thence the tears pafs into the nofe. The caruncula lachrymalis is that little gra- nulating-like body which lies in the inner angle formed by the two eye-lids. Very fmall hairs are feen to fprout from it, and feme fmall febaceous folieles open upon its furface. Connected with the caruncula la- ehrymalis is the membrana or valvula semiluna- ris. This is a vafcular membrane which is drawn from under the caruncula lachrymalis by the direction of the eye outward, fo as then to appear like a web fpread over the white of the eye near the inner can- thus. By directing the eye towards the nofe, this' membrane is again accumulated about the caruncula. This, then, is a very particular mechanifm, not as is- generally defcribed, for applying the tears to the punCta lachrymalia, but for accumulating and throw- - i x ing.

36 OF THE MEMBRANES OF THE BRAINV fiance, which is furrounded with a matter of a darker colour, and lefs diftindtly fibrous, but not lefs effential, and which is compofed of corpufcules, that, in figure and arrangement, referable the vehicles of the pulp of a lemon *. Many authors endeavour to fupport their conjectures regarding this vehicular flruclui^ of the brain by morbid diffedtionf. We fee the brain frequently degenerated into hydatids, or into little veffels, or into knobular glandular-like fchirrofities. I have feen this vehicular appearance in great portions of the pia mater. I have feen the pia mater with innumerable little bodies like mil- liary glands upon it; and alfo the whole upper and exter- nal part of the brain degenerated into one mafs of difeafe. It was hard, fchirrous, tuberculated, and like a difeafed giand j. But I cannot conceive that any conclufion, in regard to the natural ftructure of the brain, can be drawn from fuch appearances. They are to be confi- dered as the difeafes of the veffels and membranes rather than of the peculiar matter of the brain. When the brain is examined in the foetus of the early months, although the fubflance of the brain is extremely foft, and even of a fluid confidence, the membranes and veffels are fully formed, exquifitely minute, and perfect in all their proceffes, fo that they give form and firmnefs to the brain. We fee, confequently, that the due increafe and complete organization of the brain is * Malacarne, page 2. fe&. 4. ■y Wepfer de cicuta aquatica.

OF THE RETINA. 295 \ There is a kind of umbrae feen before the eyes which are occafioned by the velfels of the retina. Of this kind is the fuffufto reticularis of Sauvages, in which the perfon fees umbrageous ramifications which ftrike acrofs the fphere of vifion, and are fynchronous with the pulfe, fhowing its dependance on the full and throbing pulfation of the head. There are alfo cor- rufcations feen before the eyes in confequence of a blow upon the eye-ball, and accompanying violent head-ach, vertigo, phrenitis, epilepfy, &c. Whatever forces the blood with great violence to the head, as coughing, vomiting, fneezing, will caufe, for the inftant, fuch corrufcations, by means of the difturbed circulation through the retina. We are particularly called upon to attend to the connection betwixt the iris and the retina. In amau- i rofis, the fenfibility of the retina being entirely loft, the pupil is confequently immoveable and dilated *. But we muft recoiled, that if one eye be found, the pupil of the difeafed eye follows, in fome degree, the movement of the iris of the found eye. If one eye be tina, which perceives the gutulte exuding from the pores of the cor- nea, and which, falling over its furface, gives the appearance of their defcending. But it is only felt when the retina is exhaufted or difturbed by prefture on the eye-ball. See Sauvages SufFufio Scintillans & Suff. Danaes. * There are, however, cafes of Amaurosis a myosi, in which there is a contra&ed and immoveable pupil, and children are born with an infenfibility of the organ in which the pupil is not greatly dilated. I would be willing to attribute this peculiarity of the pupil and apparent amaurofis in newly-born children to the remains of the membrana pupillaris. X 2 fhut.

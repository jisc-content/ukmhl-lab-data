380 OF THE EARS OF ANIMALS. animals; from the fimple tube circulating the fluids of infedts, the Angle ventricle of fiflies and reptiles, the double auricle and perforated ventricle oft amphibise, up to the perfedt heart of the warm-blooded animal. The organs of generation, and the oeconomy of the foetus in utero, is, in the fame degree, capable of illuftration from comparative anatomy. But moll efpecially, in the ftrudture of the ear, is there much fcope for this kind of inveftigation. We find fuch va- rieties in the ear of reptiles, fiflies, birds, and qua- drupeds, as lead us, by gradual fleps, from the fimpler to the more complex ftrudture. The fimpleft form of the organ of hearing is that it} which we find a little fac of fluid, and on the infide of the fac ,the pulp of a nerve expanded. If an animal, having fuch an organ, breath the air, a mem- brane clofes this faculus on the fore part; and, by means of this membrane, the vibrations of the air are communicated to the expanfion of the nerve through the fluid of the fac. But if the animal inhabits the water only, it has no fuch membrane to receive the impreftion ; the organ is incafed in bone or cartilage, and inftead of the membrane, fome fmall bone or hard concreted matter is found in contadl with the pulp of the nerve.' The found, palling through the waters, is, in fuch cafe, conveyed to the organ not by any par- ticular opening, but through the bones of the head ; and this concrete fubftance, partaking of the tremulous motion communicates the fenfation to the nerve #. * It is conceived by fome that the antennae of infefts conveys to them the vibration of bodies, and that they may be confidered as an imperfect variety of ,this organ.

176 OF THE PARTICULAR NERVES. buted with the right coronary artery to the anterior part of the heart. On the left fide of the neck, the fympathetic, receiving on the one fide branches from the cervical nerves, and on the other giving off branches, which defcend behind the carotid artery to the heart, (viz. the fuperior cardiac) often fplits before it forms the middle or thyroid ganglion, and fometimes throws its branches over the thyroid artery, and the ganglion lies upon that artery. Again, from the ganglion there defcend two feries of numerous leffer filaments, which form mefhes upon the thyroid and fubclavian arteries to the heart. Others proceed downward behind the arteries to the lower cervical ganglion. Thofe branches which defcend upon the arteries, intangle the roots of the thyroid, tranfverfalis cervicis, and internal mam- mery arteries, in their plexus ; thefe uniting, follow the fubclavian artery, and form again a plexus upon the arch of the aorta. This is joined by branches from the par vagum and recurrent. The principal branches of this plexus terminate in the cardiac ganglion under the arch of the aorta *. The lower cervical ganglion f of the fympa- thetic nerve is placed upon the limits betwixt the neck and thorax upon the head of the firft rib, and by the fide of the mufculus longus colli; and it is in part co- vered by the root of the vertebral artery. The gang- lion is of an irregular cufhion-like fhape. It lies clofe â€¢ * This defcription of the fympathetic nerve on the left fide fol- lows the more ufual diftribution, but is not peculiar to the left fide. -J- The lower cervical, or, cardiac ganglion of the fympathetic nerve. 7 to

310 OF THE HUMORS OF THE EYE. It is found, now, that betwixt the lens and iris there is no fpace to which we ought to give this name of chamber. Heider, Morgagni, and M. Petit (medecin) fird de- monftrated the extreme fmallnefs of the pofterior cham- ber, and after them Window confirmed the fad, that the iris moved ahnod in contad with the anterior fur- face of the lens. M. Petit gave the cleared proof of the fmallnefs of the pofterior chamber, by freezing all the humors of the eye, and diffeding them in their folid date. With- out this expedient it was impoftible to prove the relative fize of the two chambers; for, whenever the cornea was cut, the aqueous fluid efcaped, and the lens pufhed forward. When the eye was frozen, and then difleded, it was found that the ice, which took the diape and dimenfions of the anterior chamber, was much larger than that found in the poderior chamber*; indeed the latter was formed of a very thin flake of ice. The thin piece of ice in the poderior chamber indicated as much fluid only betwixt the iris and lens as might allow a free motion to the iris. Thefe experiments were in- dituted in the courfe of invedigating the quedion of the nature of the catarad. The conclufion, that the poderior chamber of the aqueous humor contained but one-fourth of the whole aqueous humor, was admitted with great difficulty and after much conied. It determined the quedion, whe- ther the catarad was a membrane or the opaque lens; for, as thofe who maintained that it was a membrane, faid it could not be the lens, becaufe the lens was far * See Acad.

OF THE ORGAN OF HEARING. 397 here of a regular form) with the veftibule, and con- veys the vibration of the atmofphere to it. The femicircular canals are here alfo three in num- ber, and are diftinguifhed by the terms minor, major, and maximus; but as the major and minor coalefce at one of their extremities, and enter the veftibule to- gether, the femicircular canals open into the veftib^e by only five foramina in place of fix. Each of the femicircular canals is dilated at one extremity into an elliptical form, while the other extremity is of the natural fize of the diameter of the tube. Thefe canals are formed of the hard fhell of bone, and are furrounded with bone, having wider and more open cancelli. In the dry ft ate of the parts, we find a cord palling through the femicircular canals, which fome have called the zonula nerv.Â®. But thefe are the mem- branous canals, which are contained within the bony ones, dried and fhrunk up. Within the bony cavities of the labyrinth, there is laid a pellucid membrane, which contains a fluid, has the nerves expanded upon it, and is the true veftibule and femicircular canals; while the bony cafe, which we have defcribed, is merely the mold of thefe and the fupport of their de- licate texture*. The cochlea, one of the three divifions of the labyrinth, is but imperfedt in birds, when compared * I lately, by accident, drew out the facculus veflibuli and femi- cireular canals from the bony part of the ear of a bird, and I found the membranouajfemicircular canal to confift apparently of the fame pellucid elaftic matter with thofe of fifties. with

OF THE PARTICULAR NERVES. 157 Notwithflanding the deep fituation of thofe recurrent nerves, Galen fays, they were cut in thefe cafes, and he believed that the branch of communication betwixt the laryngeal and recurrent reftored the voice after fome time had elapfed. Both the internal laryngeal and recurrent nerves are neceflary to the formation of the voice. Experiments have been made upon them in dogs, and the refult is curious; although the lefler changes of the ftrength, acutenefs, and modulation of the voice could not be well obferved in the lower animals. When the laryngeal nerve is cut, the voice is feeble but acute; when the recurrent nerve is cut, there is a relaxation of thofe mufcles moving the arytenoid cartilages which command the opening of the glottis, and in confequence the voice is flatter or graver, or more raucous. The par vagum, after fending off the recurrent nerve, defcends by the fide of the trachea. Before it pafles be- hind the veflels and branch of the trachea going to the lungs, it fends minute branches which form the an- terior pulmonic plexus*. This plexus is en- tangled in the connexions of the pericardium, and is difleded with difficulty. The branches of this plexus throw themfelves round the pulmonic arteries and veins, and follow them into the lungs. The par vagum, pafling on behind the root of the lungs, forms the posterior pulmonic plexus. From this alfo the nerves proceed into the lungs, by attaching themfelves to the pulmonic arteries and veins, I * I do not conceive that this plexus admits of any ufeful divifion, or requires any diftinftion of name. and

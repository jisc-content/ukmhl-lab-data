As the impreflion of light remains fome time upon £he nerve of the eye, it gave Sir Ifaac Newton the op- portunity of examining, whether each coloured ray makes a diftind impreflion upon the eye, or whether they fo affed each other as to imprefs the fenfe of white- nefs on the eye. When a burning coal is whirled in a circle, the eye perceives an entire circle of fire, be- caufe the impreflion made by the coal in any point of the circle remains until the coal returns again to the fame place, and renews the fenfation. When all the varieties of colours are painted in a circle, and turned in the fame way with the burning coal, they muft each make their feparate impreflion upon the optic nerve j but the general fenfation is whitenefs $ or when the teeth of a comb are drawn acrofs the flream of light iffuing from a prifm, the different colours are intercepted in fuch quick fucceffion, that a perfed whitenefs is the refult of the mixture of impreffions. There are many experiments which fhow, that the in- equalities of the refradion of light are not cafual; that they do not depend upon any irregularity of the glafs : on the contrary, it is proved, that every ray of the * It is found, that the coloured rays have not all the fame power of illuminating objects ; the orange ray pofleffes this property more than the red -y the yellow more than the orange, &c.; and the maximum of illumination lies in the brighteft yellow or paled green ; nor do the feveral rays equally affcft the thermometer.

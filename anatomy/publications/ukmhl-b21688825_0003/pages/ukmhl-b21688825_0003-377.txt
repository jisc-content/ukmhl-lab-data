OF SEEING IN GENERAL. 353 image. Again, the objeft b will be feen fainter, but fingle, and correct in every refpedt. It will appear fainter, becaufe there is only one fpot in each eye which pofieflfes the degree of fenfibility neceflary to perfect vifion: and it will appear Tingle, the rays proceeding from it having exactly the fame relation to the centre of the retina in both eyes. Though they do not fall on the centre of the retina, they fall on the fame fide of the centre in both eyes. But if the eyes are made' to fix fiedfaftly on an objedt, and if another object fhould be placed before the eyes within the angle which the axis of the two eyes make with the firft object, it will be feen double, becaufe the points of the retina flruck by the rays proceeding from the nearer object do not correfpond in their relation to the central point of the retina. Thus, the eyes b b, fig. 17., having their axis directed to a, will fee the objedt e double fomewhere near the outline d d. Becaufe the line of the direction of the rays from that body c, do not flrike the retina in the fame relation to the axis ab in both eyes. Upon this principle, we may eafily explain why ob- jects, which are much nearer the eyes, or much more diflant from them than that to which the two eyes are directed, appear double. Thus, if a candle is placed at the difiance of ten feet, and I hold my finger at arms length between my eyes and the candle, when I look at the candle, I fee my finger double, and wrhen I look at my finger, I fee the candle double. This double vifion occurs to us all frequently ; but, unlefs we make the experiment purpofely, we do not attend to it. Many other inftances of the harmony, and of the want of it in the eyes, particularly the reverfe of what

OF THE PARTICULAR NERVES. 153 Thefe branches united form a fmall irregular gang- lion, from which again pafs off numerous branches to the conftri&or mufcles of the pharynx. The trunk of the gloffo-pharyngeal nerve, after giving off thofe nerves which pafs in the direction of the internal carotid artery, continues its courfe attached to the ftylo-gloffal and flylo-pharyngeal mufcles, to which of courfe it gives more branches, and alfo to the upper divifion of the conftri&or pharyngis. A divi- fion of the extreme branches of this nerve terminates in the tongue, under the denomination of rami linguales profundi, rami linguales later ales, nervi glojfo-pharyngei*. It appears to me that thefe branches are diflributed amongft the fhort mufcles of the tongue, and perhaps to the large papillae upon the mod pofterior part of the tongue. Amongft the branches of the pharyngeal nerve is to be enumerated that which turns back to join the ninth pair in its diftribution to the tonguef. The remaining branches of the gloffo-pharyngeal nerve, are diflributed in innumerable filaments upon the pharynx, in which they are aflifted by branches from the ganglion of the fympathetic nerve. THE PAR VAGUM. I ' . The par vagum is the great and important divifion of the eighth pair. It is the middle fafciculus of the three nerves as they lie within the fcull. In its exit, it is feparated from the internal jugular vein by a thin bony plate ; and fometimes two or three fibres of the * Scarpa, f Sabatier. nerve

OF THE RETINA. 285 not receive the impreftion of the rays, but that the choroid coat is the feat of the fenfe. In fupport of this theory, he foon found other arguments than thofe atifing from the deficiency of the choroid coat at the entrance of the nerve. He faw that the pupil dilated - in the fhade, and contra&ed in a more intenfe light: now, fays he, as the iris is a continuation of the cho- roid coat, this is a proof of the great fenfibility of that coat: again, the dark colour of the choroid coat he fuppofed to be well calculated for the adtion of the rays of light, which are not refledted from it or tranfmitted, but abforbed ; while, on the other hand, the retina is tranfparent. If vifion were performed in the retina, fays Marriotte, it feems that it lhould be found when- ever the retina is; and fince the retina covers the whole nerve as well as the reft of the bottom of the eye, there appears no reafon why there lhould be no vifion in the place of the optic nerve. M. Picquet argued in oppo- fition to Marriotte. He obferved, in regard to the fit- nefs of the black colour of the choroides for the adtion of the rays of light, that the choroid is not univerfally black; that there are many lhades of difference in the human eye ; and that it is black, blue, green, yellow, or of a metallic Ihining furface, in a variety of animals. He conceived, that the defedt of vifion at the infertion of the nerve is occafioned by the blood-veffels of the retina *. He obferved, alfo, that the opacity of the * Againft this hypothefis, the fize of the infenfible fpot was urged by Marriotte. Bernuoilli calculated that this fpot is a circle, the diameter of which is a feventh part of the diameter of the eye, and that the centre is 27 parts of its diameter, from the point oppofite to the pupil and a little above the middle. retina

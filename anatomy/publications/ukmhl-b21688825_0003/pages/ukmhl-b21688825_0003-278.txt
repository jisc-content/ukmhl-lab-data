254 OF THE coats of the eye. cava ; although the very great vafcularity of this coat was known to our oldefl writers, yet the appearance of thefe veffels, when empty, has deceived many.1' Morgagni * and Maitre-jean, have defcribed fibres which they affirm to be diftindl: from the veffels, but which prove to be, in fad, the appearance prefented by the collapfed veffels. The great peculiarity of the choroid coat, is its be- ing a fecreting membrane j by which I mean, that the pigmentum nigrum which is applied to the medul- lary lamina of the retina being a fecretion, the choroid coat has neceffarily that peculiar ftru&ure of veffels which belongs to the fecreting membrane. This ftruc- ture has enabled anatomifts to tear it into laminae. For that part of the choroid coat next the fclerotic coat, is merely a vehicle of veffels and nerves, and is a tiffue of them connected by very fine cellular mem- brane. The internal part, again, is organized into a fecreting fgrface, and is the tunica Ruyfchiana. I con- ceive, that the divifion into the choroid coat and tunica Ruyfchiana, is warranted from the nature of the membrane, as the divifions of the coats of the intef- tines are. Morgagni fays, that from his earlieft youth, he had many proofs that the choroid coat was not Tingle in brutes; he afferts, alfo, that Francifcus Silvius and Guenellanius had demonftrated the double laminae of this membrane before Ruyfchf. Certain it is, that Ruyfck was not fo fortunate in aferibing a ufe to this * Morgagni Epift. Anat. xvii. 2. + Idem, ibid, 3. tunica

OF THE PARTICULAR NERVES. 167 Befides thefe branches, this nerve communicates with the fifth, and gives out an origine to the phrenic nerve; and laftly, uniting to the feventh, it paffes into the axillary plexus. The seventh cervical nerve.-—This nerve goes almoil entirely to form the axillary plexus. There is n communicating nerve from the lafb to this, and from that communicating branch generally there palfes off a filament to the phrenic nerve; and from the very root of the nerve there paffes off a branch to the lower cervical ganglion of the lympathetic. Irregular twigs alfo defcend from this nerve uncffr the clavicle to the pectoralis minor and major. The eighth cervical nerve.—The greater part of this nerve paffes to the axillary plexus. It fends fmall branches to the lower cervical ganglion of the fympathetic, and to the muffles of the bread j which laff defcend behind the clavicle. RECAPITULATION OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE . CERVICAL NERVES. Upon reviewing the defcription of thefe nerves, we find that the general tendency of their branches is backwards over the fide of the neck, to the muffles moving the head and Ihoulders. We find alfo that they are connefted in a very intricate manner with the moll important nerves of the cranium. High in the neck and under the jaw, they are connected with the portio dura, with the fifth pair, with the eighth and ninth pairs, and with the fympathetic. Towards the middle of the neck they are (till throwing their con- necting branches to the deffendens noni, and fympa- M 4 thetic.

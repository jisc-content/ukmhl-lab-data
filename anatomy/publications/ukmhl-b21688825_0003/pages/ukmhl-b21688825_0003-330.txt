306 OF THE MEMBRANA PUPILLARIS. Dr. Hunter, fpeaking further of the artery of the criftalline capfule, fays, “ that it does not terminate at the great circle of that humor. Its fmall branches pafs that circle, and run a very little way on the anterior furface of the criftalline humor before the points of the ciliary proceffes; then they leave the humor and run forwards, fupported on a very delicate membrane, to lofe themfelves in the membrana pupillas.” He con- tinues : “ The membrana pupillse receives two different fets of arteries, one larger, from the iris, and the other much fmaller, but very numerous from the criftalline capfula.” Now I think that every expreflion in thefe excerpts confirms the opinion I entertain, that thefe veffels which are feen filled with red blood, and which take their courfe through the humors, are fubfervient merely to the membrana pupillaris. The firft time I obferved the membrana pupillaris was in the eye of a child born at the full time. I had Injected the child very minutely with fize and vermilion, and the iris was beautifully red and the pupil quite tranfparent and black, and not obfcured by any extra- vafation of the injection into the aqueous humor : upon very narrowly obferving the circle of the iris, I faw diftindlly a fmall inje&ed veffel pafs out from the edge of the iris, and crofting the pupil, divide into two branches which ran into the oppofite margin of the iris. This was the remains of the membrane, but fo delicate and fo perfectly tranfparent, that the prefence of it was only to be argued from the veffel which was feen to crofs the pupil. Since

414 or THE HUMAN EAR. Mr. Home, in the Philofophical Tranfactions for 1800, afferts, that the membrana tympani is mufcular; that its fibres run from the circumference towards the centre; and that they are attached to the malleus. But, what is the fuppofed ufe of this mufcular membrane ? Mr. Home fays, it is principally by means of this mufcle that accurate perceptions of found are communicated to the internal organ; that it is by means of this mufcle that the membrana tympani is enabled to vary its degree of tenfion, fo as to receive the vibrations in the quick fuccefiion in which they arc conveyed to it. But we have feen, that the tenfion and relaxation of the membrana tympani is already fufficiently provided; for “ the malleus has three “ mufcles by which it is moved; one of them is called “ the tenfor, from its pulling the malleus inward and “ tightening the membrane of the tympanum; the <c other two act in an oppofite direction, and relax the “ membrane*”. We fhould naturally fuppofe this to be fufficient; but, according to Mr. Home, thefe mufcles adt only to bring the membrane into fuch a degree of tenfion, as to enable the minuter changes of the mufcular membrane to have their full effedt; and that the play of thefe mufcles gives the perception of grave and acute tones. But the more favourite idea of Mr. Home is, that, upon the accurate adjuftment of the membrana tym- pani, the difference between a mufical ear, and one which is too imperfedt to diffinguifh the different notes in mufic, depends ; that this judgment or tafte * Mr. Home’s Lecture. 18

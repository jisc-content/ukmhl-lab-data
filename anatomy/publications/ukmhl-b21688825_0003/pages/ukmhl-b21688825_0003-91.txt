OF THE VEINS OF THE BRAIN. 65 The TRANSVERSE, Or POSTERIOR CLYNGID SINUS, runs acrofs from one oblique finus to another behind the pofterior clynoid proceffes *. In its form it is not peculiar, nor is it very regular. There are two petrous sinuses, the anterior and pofterior, or the inferior and fuperior finufes j thefe two come off nearly together from the carvernous finus, and running back upon the petrous bone, terminate in the lateral ftnufes or beginning of the internal jugular vein; but which two to take as petrous finufes is a queftion. For example, Malacarne fhows that there is a finus, by no means uncommon, which belongs as ftriftly as thofe others to the petrous portion of the temporal bone. He calls this new finus the anterior petrous finus; and the fuperior of other writers, he calls the pofterior petrous finus; and the inferior petrous finus of other writers, as it lies more upon the cuneiform apophyfis of the occipital bone, and runs flantingly, he calls the oblique. I would on the contrary confider two of thefe as the petrous finufes; the oblique finufes of Mala- carne, as the lateral bafilar finufes; and thofe which run on the middle of the cuneiform apophyfis, as the middle bafilar finufes. The anterior petrous sinus runs upon the anterior face of the petrous bone, from near the fpi- nal hole t ; whence, making a femicircular curve in- * In truth the fuperior, and inferior, or oblique finus, the caver- nous, and the tranfverfe, meet nearly at a point. f And here it has a tranfverfe branch of communication with the cavernous finus, whicfi runs under the extended point of the ten- torium.

OF THE VENTRICLES OF THE BRAIN. The centrum ovale is merely the appearance which the white and internal part of the cerebrum takes when the brain is cut horizontally on the level of the corpus Callofum ; for then the corpus callofuni is the centre of the great medullary mafs of the cere- brum, and the external cineritious matter being on the edges only forms it into an irregular oval. THE SEPTUM LUCIDUM. The two lateral ventricles lying under the corpus cal- lofilm and medullary centre are divided by a partition, which defcends from the lower furface of the corpus cal- lofum, and refts upon the fornix. This feptum of the ventricles is tranfparent, and confifts of two lamina, and thefe confifl of medullary and cineritious matter * *. Be- twixt thefe is the cavity of the feptum lucidum f. The fize and fhape of this cavity differs in a variety of fub- jedls. It is of a triangular fhape, and from eighteen to twenty lines in length J. It has a fluid exhaling into it like the ventricles, and is by fome counted as a fifth ventricle : according to Santorini it opens in the bafe of the brain, oppofite to the union of the optic nerves. Vieuffens ^lefcribes it communicating with the third made anatomifts attend to thofe tranfverfe lines, in the hopes of find- ing fucli a decuflation of thefe lines as would account for it. Sab- batier fays, they have brought themfelves to believe that there was a decuflation, but after careful inveftigation he could find no fuch thing. See Window.

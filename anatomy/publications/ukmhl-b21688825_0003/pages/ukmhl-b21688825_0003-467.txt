OF HEARING IN GENERAL. 443 abfolute and uniform refinance to the motion of the fluids.â€”But, as it is, the provifion is beautiful. The membrane of the foramen rotundum alone gives way of all the furfaces within the labyrinth, and this leads the courfe of the undulations of the fluid in the laby- rinth in a certain unchangeable-direction. To me it appears, that to give a double dire&ion to the motion of the fluids, or to the vibration in the labyrinth, far from encreafmg the effect, would tend to annihilate the vibrations of both foramina by antagonizing them. The common idea is, that there is a motion communicated through the membrane of the foramen rotundum along the fcala tympani, and another through the foramen ovale into the veftibule, and through the veftibule into the fcala veftibuli; and that the concuflion of thefe meet in the infundibulum of the cochlea. But as there is no fpace for motion in the fluids in either the one or other of thefe tradts, the vibration muff have been re- ceived in the infundibulum at the fame time that the motion was communicated to the membranes of the foramen ovale and rotundum; for if a tube full of water, a mile in length, lofes one drop from the ex- tremity, there mull be an inftantaneous motion through the whole to fupply its place. The evident confequence of this double motion would be, (if they were of the fame ftrength) to fupprefs all motion or vibration in the fluids of the labyrinth. But we have lhown that the flrength of vibration communicated to the foramen ovale and foramen ro tundum are not the fame : for the mechanifm of the G g 4 bones

OF THE VEINS OF THE !BRAIN. 46 blood *. Pacchioni defcribes duXs pafling from them to the pia mater, (which are thofe connexions that we have already remarked,) and conceives that they lubri- cate the furface, or communicate with the fubftance of the brain; and that they are preffed, and their fecre- tion promoted by the motion of the chordae Willifianae, and the aXion of the dura mater f. I fhould rather conceive that they had a valvular aXion on the mouths of the veins ; they projeX from the mouths of the veins into the fmus, and the blood pafling from the veins mufl filter through them, and be checked in its retrograde courfe, and perhaps obftruX- ed in its natural courfe when they are enlarged. As thefe bodies differ very much in the variety of fubjeXs, they mufl: fometimes impede the free egrefs of the blood from the veins of the cerebrum into the longitu- dinal finus, and caufe difeafe, efpecially as they are fofter and larger in old men J. At all events, they are too much overlooked in morbid diifeXion.

Thus, from the edge of the injured membrane, a new membrana tympani was obliquely ftretched acrofs the cavity of the tympanum, fo as to exclude the malleus and incus from that cavity, but including the head of the ftapes, as if nature, finding the feparated bones no longer neceflary, had attached the membrane to the head of the ftapes *. We have already remarked, that, when the organ of one fide is injured, we hear fo much better with the other, that we attend only to the fenfation conveyed by it,Tind neglect the duller fenfation.

l6o OF THE PARTICULAR NERVES. the from it when it has efcaped from the fcull. Under the bafe of the cranium it is attached to the ninth pair alfo. Commonly this attachment is firm ; fometimes, it is by a fhort filament. This parafitical nerve then paffes be- hind the internal jugular vein, and paffes obliquely downward and backward. It then perforates the mafloid mufcle, and paffes in a direction acrofs the neck to the fhoulder. While it pierces, it gives nerves to the mafloid mufcle; and after piercing, it entangles its branches with thofe of the third and fourth cervical nerves. It then paffes under the trapezius mufcle, and is diflributed to it, where it is on the back of the neck and fhoulder. From the diflribution of this nerve we difcover that the fhrug of the fhoulders is very natural; and “ pourquoi les grandes paflions de l’ame nous portent a gefliculer, pour ainfi dire, malgre nous!”* OF THE NINTH PAIR, OR LINGUALIS MEDIUS OR IIypoglossus. After paffing out from the fcull by the anterior con- dyloid foramen, the ninth nerve adheres to the eighth pair, by cellular filaments, and the interchange of nerves. It receives alfo branches from the firfl cervical nerve, or from the branch of union of the firfl and fecond cervical nerves. When differing in the neck, we find the ninth nerve lying by the fide of the inter- nal jugular vein under the flyloid mufcles, and coming out from under the occipital branch of the internal carotid artery. The nerve here divides, or it may rather be. faid to give off that branch which is called the Descendens Noni. The continued trunk of the nerve paffes before * Sabatier.

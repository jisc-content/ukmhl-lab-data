OF THE PARTICULAR NERVES. S 79 accessorius. This nerve as frequently terminates in the renal plexus, as in the femilunar ganglion; or fometimes it fends branches to both. CiELIAC GANGLION AND PLEXUS. I . The ganglion which is called the femilunar gang- lion, has no regular fhape—and lead of all when it is fully differed. It is formed by the fplanchnic nerve, and by branches which come from the lumbar nerves. It lies by the fide of the caeliac artery, and confifls of many lefier ganglions, (fometimes to the number of eleven or twelve,) matted together into a glandular-like fhape. The femilunar ganglions of the fplanchnic nerves lying on each fide of the root of the cctliac artery, their connection with each other is frequent and in- tricate j fo that they throw a mefh of nerves round the root and branches of this artery, which is the great fource of veffels to the flomach, liver, and fpleen.— This plexus, formed by the femilunar ganglions round the cseliac artery, is the folar or cseliac plexus. CELIAC PLEXUS. The ca-liac plexus is the great fource of nerves to the higher vifcera of the abdomen. The fplanchnic nerves are the great, but not the only nerves which form this plexus. The par vagum fends branches .down from the flomach which join it; and even the phrenic nerve, which is the nerve of the diaphragm, fends down twigs to unite to the branches of the fplanchnic and par vagum.

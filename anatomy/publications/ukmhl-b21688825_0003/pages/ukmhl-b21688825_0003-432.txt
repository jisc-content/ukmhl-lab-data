I have obferved an artery of a very large fize, (compared with the furface to be fupplied), running by the fide of the long procefs or handle of the malleus. In this courfe, it is giving out fmall branches; and Nwhen the trunk arrives at the extreme point of the long procefs of the malleus, it divides into two confiderable branches, the extreme fubdivifions of which run towards the margin of the membrane. This artery is, neverthelefs, too fmall to require us particularly to avoid it in the puncturing of the membrane for deafnefs, produced by obftru&ion of the euftachean tube. The opinions regarding the mufcularity of the mem- brane of the tympanum, Ihall be referved until we have confidered the whole mechanifm of the parts in the tympanum. OF THE CHAIN OF BONES IN THE TYMPANUM. The vibrations of the membrane of the tympanum are tranfmitted to the foramen ovale by four moveable bones'; the malleus, incus, os orbiculare, and ftapes. Thefe bones are named from their lhape, and the names affift in conveying an idea of their form. They are fo united by articulation and fmall ligaments, as to form an uninterrupted chain; and, while they tranfmit the vibration, their mechanifm is fuch, that they flrengthen the impulfe. They have alfo fmall mufcles # See Mr. Homeâ€™s ledure on the ftrudure and ufe of the mem. brana tympani. Phil. Traufad. Part I. 1800. attached

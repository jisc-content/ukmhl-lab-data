OF SEEING IN GENERAL. 351 not always parallel; for when both eyes are directed to a near objedt, the axis of the eyes meet in that objedt; but when we diredt the eyes to the objedts in the heavens, they may be conddered as perfedtly parallel in their axis, though perhaps not then mathematically fo. To an obferver, the eyes feem always moving in parallel diredtions; but nature has given us the power of varying them fo, that we can diredt them to the fame point, whether remote or near. This, however, is in fome meafure learnt by cuftom, and loft by difufe. A child has much difficulty in altering the diltance of its eyes, which is the occafion of the vacancy of its ftaref; and again, we obferve that a patient who has long loft one eye, is incapable of diredting the axis of the blind eye without looking with the other, and even then, the blind organ does not follow the other with that perfedt accuracy which exercife gives when both eyes are found. By much pradtice and draining, the axis of the eyes may be much further altered from the natural parallelifm, which wags and hoys often do, fo â™¦ as to diflort the eyes, and give a droll obliquity to the countenance. Still, cudom alters the diredtion of the axis of the eyes but a very little; for the natural conditution of the eye does not allow the child to turn his eyes in every different diredtion from each other. There is, on the contrary, as we have feen, a particular fendble- fpot in the retina, which makes it neceffary to didindt vifion, that this fpot fhall receive the concentrating rays of light; and the natural conditution of both eyes, is, that this fpot in each eye fhall have fuch a relation to that of the other, that the axis of both fhould

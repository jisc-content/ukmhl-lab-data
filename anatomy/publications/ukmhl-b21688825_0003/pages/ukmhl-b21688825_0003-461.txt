437 feV OF THE HUMAN EAR. ! SECTION IV. OF THE NERVEi As the feventh pair of nerves arifes in feveral fafci- culi, they form what would be a flat nerve, were it not twilled into a cylindrical form, adapted to the fora- men auditorium internum. While thefe fafciculi are wrapped in one common coat, they are matted to- gether. In the canal, the nerve is divided nearly into tw'o equal parts* ; to the cochlea and to the veflibulum and femicircular canals. Thofe fafciculi, which are deftined for the veflibule, are the mod confpicuous; and on the portion deftined for the ampullse of the fuperior and external canal, there is fonned a kind of knot or ganglion. Before the auditory nerves pafs through the minute foramina in the bottom of the meatus auditorius, they lay afide their coats and become more tender and of a purer white colour; and, by being ftiil further fubdi- vided by the minute branching and divifions of the foramina, they cannot be followed, but finally expand in a white pulpy-like fubftance on the facs and am- pullae. We muft, however, recollect that there was a difference to be obferved in the apparent texture of thefe expanded nerves in the lower animals: we may obferve here, alfo, that part of the nerve which is ex- panded on the common belly or facculus tubulorum. * Of the portio dura we have already fpoken.

I OF THE RETINA. 3Of many animals are in quick purfuit of their prey, while we are groping our way with the affiltance of our other fenfes. Animals which feek their prey in a light wdrich is darknefs to us, have, moll: probably, a greater degree of fenfibility of the retina. But they have alfo a more confpicuous apparatus in the largenefs of their eyes, and the dilatability of their pupil, while the fenfibility which this provifion gives, is often guarded from the light of day by the membrana nidtitans, and by an iris capable of great contradlion. Their iris pof- feffes alfo a great power of contradtion in narrowing the pupil during the day, as it is capable of dilating during the night, to the whole extent of the cornea. In the human eye, alfo, the fhri£b fympathy between the iris and retina is a guard to the latter. But it has often happened that, in ufing optical inftruments, the retina has been hurt by the intenfity of the light from the concentrated rays: a Idler degree of this effed we have given us in the following inltance *. “ Being occupied in making an exadt meridiap, in prder to obferve the tranlit of Venus, I ralhly directed to the fun, by my right eye, the crofs hairs of a fmall telefcope. I had often done the like in my younger days with impunity ; but I fulfered by it at laft, which I mention as a warning to others. I foon obferved a remarkable dimnefs in that eye, and for many weeks, when I was in the dark, or Ihut my eyes, there appeared before the right eye a lucid fpot, which trembled much j^ke the image of the fun feen by reflection from water.

468 .AMYGDALAE. gland : it is loofely covered with the inverting mem- brane of thefe parts : its furface is feen, even in a living perfon, to be full of large cells like lacunae; thefe com- municate ; and the lefier mouths of the duds open into them. , The gland is of a foft relaxed nature, adapting itfelf to the extenfive motion of thofe parts. From this naturally Ioofe texture, and from its being a vafcular and fecreting body, expofed to the immediate viciflitudes of weather, it is often inflamed, and greatly impedes the adion of the furrounding mufcular fibres in the adion of deglutition. The ufe of the amygdala is evidently to lubricate the paffage of the throat, and facilitate the fwallowing of the raorfel; and, for this reafon, are the mouths of its duds cellular and irre- gular, that they may retain the mucus until ejeded by the adion of deglutition. In this operation, the amygdalae are aflifted by numerous lefler glands, which extend all over the arrhes of the palate anti pharynx. But thefe are parts which come again to be recapitulated, as introdudory to the account of the ftrudure of the cefophagus and ftomach, in the fucceeding volume.

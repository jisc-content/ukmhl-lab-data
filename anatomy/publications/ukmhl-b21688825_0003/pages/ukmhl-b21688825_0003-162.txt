136 OF THE PARTICULAR NERVES. 2d, The SUPERIOR MAXILLARY NERVE, which paffes through the foramen rotundum. 3d, The INFERIOR MAXILLARY NERVE, which paffes to the lower jaw, through the foramen ovale. The optbalmic branch of the fifth pair. This nerve enters the orbit in three divifions; thefe are, the frontal, the nafal, and the lachrymal nerves. iff, The firft of thefe runs under the periofteum of the upper part of the orbit, and above the levator pal- pebras fuperioris. Upon entering the orbit it gives off a fmall branch, which paffes to the frontal fmus ; the nerve then divides into the fuper trochlearis, and the proper frontal nerve. The firft of thefe paffes to the inner part of the orbicularis oculi and frontal mufcle. The other, the outermoft, and the proper frontal nerve, paffes through the hole, or notch, in the margin of the orbit, and mounts upon the mufcles and integuments of the forehead. Thefe fuperftcial branches communicate with the extreme branches of the portio dura, or nervus communicans faciei. Cafes are on record of wounds of the frontal nerve occafioning a great variety of nervous fymptoms, and efpecially lofs of fight; and it certainly marks a very particular connection and fympathy betwixt this branch and the common nerves which pafs to the eye-ball and iris, and the retina, that blindnefs is actually occafioned by the pricking of the frontal nerve. Morgagni fup- pofes this to be occafioned by the fpafmodic aCtion of the reCti mufcles preffmg the globe of the eye down againfl the optic nerve. It is alfo remarkable, that im- preffions acting folely on the retina, will convulfe the mufcles of the eye, give them irregular contractions, and

OF THE MEMBRANA PUPILLARIS. 307 Since that time I have often feen it in the early months, and particularly ftrong about the feventh month of the foetus. It is then an opaque, and very vafcular membrane, and generally it has fpots and flreaks of extravafation in it. The vafcular ftru&ure of 'this membrane is very particular, and I can aflign no other reafon for this than that it may be a provifion for its rapid abforption. It has evidently two fources of veffels, viz. the veffels of the capfules and thofe of the iris ; but whether the arteries come by the one fource, and the veins depart by the other, I cannot as yet determine. In one preparation I fee the veffels with their trunk in the membrana pupillaris, and the branches fent over the furface of the iris. The larger and flat venous-like veffels of the mem- brane are diflributed in a beautiful net-work, in the form of the lozinge of a Gothic window. They have a free communication with each other. In their whole courfe the veffels feem nearly of the fame fize, (which alfo is like the character of a venous net-work), and they terminate apparently in the margin of the iris. The ufe of the membrana pupillaris I think fuf- ficiently apparent, though I do not find that it has hitherto been underfiood. Haller makes a comparifon betwixt this membrane, which clofes up the pupil, and that matter which is accumulated in the paffage of the ear in the foetus. But there is no analogy.â€”As the waters of the amnios might otherwife be in contaft with the membrane of the drum of the ear, and injure what neceffarily is of a dry and arid nature, to adapt it for receiving the vibrations of the air, this matter accumu- lated in the ear of the foetus defends it. But at the time.

OF THE RETINA. 234 at once. The effect of vifion, therefore, is obferved only in very careful experiments. Experiments were, however, made by M. Picard, Marriotte, and Le Catr to render this effect produced by the image falling on the centre of the optic nerve evident, when looking with both eyes. Marriotteâ€™s fecond experiment was this: Place two round pieces of paper at the right of your eyes, three feet from one another, then place yourfelf oppofite to them at the diftance of 12 or 13 feet, and hold your thumb before your eyes at the diftance of about eight inches, fo that it may conceal from the right eye the paper that is to the left hand, and from the left eye the paper to the right hand. If, now, you look at your thumb fteadily with both eyes, you will lofe fight of both the papers *. The novelty of fuch a difcovery was likely, as frequently is the cafe, to carry mens minds beyond the true point. It requires time for fuch fadts to defcend to their level, in the fcale of importance, with other lefs novel obferva- tions. Marriotte, upon this fadt, formed a new hy- pothefis relating to the feat of vifion. We have ob- ferved, that the choroid coat and pigmentum nigrum are deficient, where the optic nerve enters the eye, and is about to expand into the retina. He fixed upon the moil unaccountable fuppofition, that the retina does * Dr. Smith made the dream of light through the key-hole of a dark chamber fall upon this point of the retina, oppofite to the ter- mination of the optic nerve, but he found it quite infenfible even to this degree of light. M. Picquet aflerts, that very luminous objefts make a faint imprefilon on the centre of the optic nerve. But Dr. Priedley fays, that a candle makes no impreffion on that part of his eye. not

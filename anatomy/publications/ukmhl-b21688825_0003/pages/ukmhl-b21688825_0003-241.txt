OF THE SENSES. 217 powers of the mind, which, by the conflitution of our nature, are gradually acquired, and encreafed by exer- cife. In infancy, the perceptions are fimple and tran- fitory ; the memory is perfected by degrees, and with the ftore of ideas the imagination is invigorated. - It is in the combination and reciprocal effedts of the mental powers and of the impreffion on the external fenfes, that we are to find an explanation of the operation of attention and its hiftory. When the mental powers are led to the contemplation of an idea which aflimilates eafily with the fenfation about to be prefented by the external organ, the perception is quick, and the idea vivid; but when the mind is ftrongly imprefled and occupied with the contemplation of pad ideas, the prefent operation of the fenfe is neglected and overlooked. Thus, the vividnefs of the perception or idea, is always proportionate to the degree pf undiftradted attention which the mind is able to beftow on the objedt of fenfation or of memory. In folitude and darknefs, the ftrength of the memory in the contemplation of paft events is encreafed, becaufe there is no intrufion of the objedls of the outward fenfes ; and the deaf or blind receive fome compenfa- tion for their lofs in the encreafed powers which are acquired by a more frequent and undifturbed ufe of the fenfes which remain, and a keener attention to the fenfations which they prefent. On the other hand, when we are under the enchantments of a waking dream or revery, our attention is wholly detached from the prefent objedls of the fenfes; and in this Hate we may even continue to read without underftand- ing. This abfence, in a certain degree, is common, Qj; natural.

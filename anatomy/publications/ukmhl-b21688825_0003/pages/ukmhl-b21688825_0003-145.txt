THE ORIGIN OF THE NERVES. I 19 injured, it is the eye of the oppofite fide that is affect- ed *. After their union the optic nerves are much con- tracted in diameter ; ftill the optic nerve, is the largeft of the head, excepting the fifth pair. It is the firmeft of all the nerves of the fenfes, but fofter than the other nerves f. What remains to be faid of the optic nerves, falls more naturally to be treated of when fpe^king of the organ of vifion. THIRD PAIR OF NERVES ; MOTORES OCULORUM. The third pair of nerves arife from the internal mar- gin of the crura cerebri, and the perforated medullary matter which is betwixt the crura. The delicate fila- ments of this nerve cannot be traced far into the fub- ftance of the brain, but ftill we may obferve them fpreading their filaments, and traverfing the dark co- loured fpot which we have already mentioned to be vifible in the crura cerebri. Some anatomifts have faid, that the third pair of nerves had an origin alfo from the nates and teftes. Ridley defcribes them as rifing from the pons varolii J. In relation to the arteries, thofe nerves are betwixt the pofterior artery of the cerebrum, arifing from the divifion of the bafilar artery and the anterior artery of * If Petit and others are proving that the optic nerves are affect- ed in the fide oppofite to the injury of the brain, they are proving that they have no decuffation ; for if they had, it would counteract that effeft, which, from the ftruCture of the brain, they muff have in common with the other nerves. -j- Soemmerring. f They feem to come from the angle betwixt the crura cerebri and pons varolii. They are flat near their origin, but become round and firm. I 4 the /

And when you have brought him td con- tinue the axis of both eyes fixed upon you, as you jfland direCtly before him, it will be time to change his pof- ture, and to fet him firft a little to one fide of you and then to the other, and fo to praCtife the fame thing; and when, in all thefe fituations, he can perfectly and readily turn the axis of both eyes towards you, the cure is effected. An adult perfon may praCtife all this with a glafs, without any director, though not fo eafily as with one.-—But the older he is the more patience is neceffary. About twenty years ago, I attempted a cure, after this manner, upon a young gentleman about nine years of age, with promifing hopes of fuccefs $ but was interrupted by his falling ill of the fmall-pox, of which he died.” Dr. Jurin preferred this method to the ufe of tubes or fhells with fmall holes in them, which have been recommended. But what appears to me the great difficulty, lies in the ftrength of the impreflion received upon the found eye, which, caufing the impreflion of the weak eye to be entirely neglected, it is again thrown out of the line of direct vifion. I conceive it, there- fore, to be a neceffary part of the experiment with tubes or fhells, that the vifion through the tube, ap- plied to the found eye, fhajl be fo obfcured as to have feme accordance with the leffer fenfibility of the weak eye, and then, objects being feen equally with both t/yes, a gradual accordance of the mufcles may be pro- duced. The conviction of the neceffity of giving an equality to the ftrength of the fenfation of both eyes muff have {truck M. de Buffon, fince he fays, in his Differtation in the Academy of Sciences, that a plane glafs

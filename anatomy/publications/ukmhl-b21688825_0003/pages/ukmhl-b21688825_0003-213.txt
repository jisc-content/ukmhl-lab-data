OF THE PARTICULAR NERVES. 18/ If after this the fpine be divided, the motion of the j lungs ceafes entirely, and the animal dies fuddenly.—• The injury of the fpinal marrow above the origine of the phrenic nerves, is of courfe fuddenly fatal, becaufe it deftroys at once the fun&ion of the diaphragm, and mufcles moving the cheft. From the'connexion of the phrenic nerve with the par vagum, we may ex- plain the fympathy betwixt the trachea and the dia- . phragm, how the irritation of the trachea occafions coughing and the convulfive action of the diaphragm ; in the fame manner in the affeftion of the ftomach, fmgultus, from the fudden a&ion of the diaphragm and abdominal mufcles, (which ufually alternate in their aftion,) may be explained. Again, a connexion of nerves might be followed from the origines of the phrenic to the fympathetic nerve, and branches of the fifth pair to the nofe; which accounts for that fympathy of action which occafions fneezing from irritation of the membrane of the nofe. NERVES OF THE ARM ; AXILLARY, OR BRACHIAL PLEXUS. The nerves which proceed from the fpine, and go to fupply the arm, are formed into an intricate plexus before they divide into the feveral nerves of the arm. This brachial, or axillary plexus, is formed of five of the fpinal nerves ; viz. the fifth, fixth, feventh, and eighth cervical nerves *, and the firfl dorfal nerve. * This is of courfe counting the fuboccipital as the firft cervical nerve.

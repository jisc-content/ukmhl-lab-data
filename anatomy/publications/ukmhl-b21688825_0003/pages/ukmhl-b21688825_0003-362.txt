33ยง DISTANCE OF OBJECTS* and dilatation of the pupil, from the degree of opening of the eye-lids. If he be right in his way of account - ing for the effedts produced in the experiments which he details, they ought to have the effedt of precluding the neceflity of all further hypothecs; fo fully does the action of the orbicularis mufcle feem to him adapted to the end propofed. In the firfl experiment, when he opened his eye-lids wide, and endeavoured to read a book the letters on which were fo near the eye as to be indiftindt, he found that he could not do it. In the fecond experiment, keeping the head in the fame re- lation to the book, he brought the edges of the eye- lids within a quarter of an inch of each other, and then made an exertion to read, when he found he could fee the letters and words diffinctly. When I try this ex- periment, I find the adtion of the eye-lids to have no fenfible effedt, unlefs they are brought very clofe to- gether : then, I do indeed find that they have a moft remarkable effedt. But in this fituation, the eye-lids cover the cornea fo much, that if they have any effedt at all upon the cornea, it muff be to comprefs and flatten it, and not to give it a greater convexity. The fmaller the opening of the eye-lids, the greater I found the effedt. I conceive it to be produced by the optical effedt of the eye-lafhes corredting the too great con- verging of the rays; and the fame effect I found to be produced by the marginal hairs of two flat camel- hair brufhes, although the eve-lids were kept open. Dr. Monro concludes that, in this action of the eye, 5ft, the iris, sdly, the redti mufcles, 3dly, the two oblique mufcles, and, 4thly, the orbicularis palpebra- rum.

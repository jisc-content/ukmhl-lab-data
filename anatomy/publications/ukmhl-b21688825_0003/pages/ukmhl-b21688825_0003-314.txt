OF THE RETINA. 290 thalmia, there is in the beginning a ftiort-fightednef$> fo that objects are feen only when near the eye. Thus far we might account for the defedt of vifion by the alteration of the focus of the cornea and humors; but, by and bye, as the eye enlarges, as it becomes turgid, and the coats more diftended, the pupil becomes fta- tionary, and the vifion is loll before the aqueous humor has become turbid *. The connexion and fympathy betwixt the retina and the vifcera of the abdomen is fometimes very particular: I have feen frequently a proof of this in the diforder of the ftomach having an immediate effect on the fen- fibility of the retina. Allied to this, but greater in de- gree, is the amaurofis which attacks hylterical women fuddenly with head-ach and violent pain. From fuch fympathy of parts arife the amaurofis bilofa, verminofa intermittens, arthritica, &c. Such attacks of blindnefs have been found to alternate with convulfions f. The * To complete fuch a ^afe, we may further obferve, that there is now an acceffion of pain, a tenfion over the forehead and pericrania, and there is fometimes accompanying it a fwclling and infenGbility of the fide of the face. So luxation or difplacement of the eye, by1 tumors, caufes blindnefs, by extending the optic nerve or comprefling the eye-ball and confequently the retina. •f- The following is an ingenious account of the manner in which this may be produced, though to me it is not fatisfactory :—“ Non infrequens caecitas poll convulfiortes graves et frequentes, fed a ne- mine quod fciam redte defcripta caufa ; hanc non ab humoris affiuxU deduco, ut voluerunt, fed quia in magnis illis per paroxyfmas con- vulfionum partium omnium, et oculorum firoul contorfionibus in quibus faepe quoque convulfi, admodumque exerti et inflexi appa- rent, attrafto lie nrmium et tenfo nervo optico, illis adnato illoque fimul

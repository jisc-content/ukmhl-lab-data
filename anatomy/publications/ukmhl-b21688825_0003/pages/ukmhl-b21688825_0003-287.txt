OF THE IRIS. CHAP. III. OF THE IRIS. The iris is the coloured circle which furrounds the pupil, and which we fee through the tranfparent cor- nea of the eye. It is a membrane hung before the criftalline lens *. It is as if perforated in the middle ; and this hole in the middle of the iris is the pupil; and through the pupil only can the rays be tranfmitted to the bottom of the eye. When we hear of the dilata- tion and contra&ion of the pupil, we have to under- hand the a&ion of the iris, which, by poifeffing the power of contrafting and relaxing, holds a controul over the quantity of light tranfmitted to the bottom of the eye. For by the extenfion of this membrane, the diameter of the pupil is diminifhed, and, by contrac- tion of the membrane, it is dilated. This motion of the iris, and, confequently, the fize of the pupil, is connected with the fenfation of the retina ; by which * \Ymflow and Haller, and moll of the old anatomifts, call this uvea ; but moll; of the modern anatomifts follow Zinn and Lieu- taud, in calling it iris; though Lieutaud and others called the an- terior furface only iris, while they ftill continued to call this perfo- rated membrane choroides, or uvea. See Lieut, p. 117. Again, others call the pofterior furface of the iris uvea, from its likenefs to the dark colour of a raifin; and the word iris is borrowed, I fupDofe, from the varied colours of the rainbow, T 2 means*

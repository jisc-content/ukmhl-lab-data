Leeuwenhoeck f obferved, in the cortical fubftance of the brain, a pellucid, chriftalline, and to appearance oily matter; he calls this, therefore, N the fubftantia vitrea. When he had put a fmall portion of this under his glafs, he faw a fluid, which he at firft conceived might have efcaped from the globules that were necef- farily cut by the knife. This fluid alfo he found to confift of very minute globules, thirty-fix times lefs than thofe of the blood J. Thefe fmall globules he conceived to have probably conftituted a fluid, which, during the life of the animal, was moveable, and in veflels, though now in death congealed and fixed ยง. The colour of the cortical fubftance he found to depend upon the minute ramification of the veflels which were of a dark brown colour, while, in the medullary part, they were clearer and more tranfparent. Independently of this diftindtion of veflels, he could obferve little dif- ference in the medullary and cineritious fubftance; the refradtion of the rays of light amongft the tranfparent globules being the caufe of the whitenefs of the former. * Malacarne, Part II. left. 18. f He was born in Delft, in Holland, 1632, and died 1723. He is celebrated for his microfcopical difcoveries; his papers are chiefly in the Tranfa&ions of the Royal Society of London, about the year 1674.

Thefe red globules, he fuppofes, had efcaped in confequence of the minute veffels having been cut by the knife. a R. della

Indeed, when the finall pores of the fkin or foramina are examined narrowly, the cutticle is feen to form fheaths which enter into them, and which, when torn out, are like little tubes having a perforated point. When, by maceration, the cutticle is feparated from the fkin, as we draw it off we fee little proceffes of the cutticle, which enter into the pores of the ikin, Mr. Cruickfhanks enumerates three claffes of pro- ceffes : there appear evidently two. The firft lines the pores through which the hairs pafs: thefe are the longed, and generally have the longed: diameter. The fecond clafs is eafily diftinguifhed on the inlide of the cutticle, which covers the palms of the hands or foies of the feet, or indeed on any part of the cutticle; and they appear in regular order on thofe parts of the cutticle which correfpcnd with the parallel or fpirai ridp-es of the cutis. The furface of the cutticle is uniform O next the fkin; but, on the outer furface, it is rough and fquamous. Thefe fquamrn are the portions of the cutticle, which, breaking up, are rubbed off; and thus there is a perpetual change, by the formation of new cutticle under the old, and the abrafipn or difquamatiou of the old furface* In youth, the cutticle is thin and tranfparent; ill old age, it becomes thick, rough, and furrowed: deformem pro cute pellcm Pendenteifcjue gena's et taleis adfpice rugas Qualeis umbriferos ubi pandit tabraca faltus In vet ubi fealpit jam mater fimia bucca. • ‘ The

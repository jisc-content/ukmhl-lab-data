O? THE PARTICULAR NERVES. 203 third lumbar nerves, which form a mufcular nerve of considerable fize. This mufcular nerve paffes down upon the irfide of the pelvis, efcapes from the back part of the pelvis, and is diftributed to the gluteus medius, the gluteus minimus, and the tenfor vagina: femoris. 2d. There pafs off one or two very fmall nerves from the body of the ifchiatic nerve, while yet within the pelvis, or from the middle divifions of its origins, which go to the pyriformis and gluteus medius mufcles. 3d. Juft where the great nerve paffes over the pos- terior ligaments of the pelvis, there goes off a twig to the obturator externus gernini and quadratus femoris. While thefe nerves are fent off upon the anterior face of the nerve, there goes backward a large fafciculus of nerves to the glutei mufcles, and to the integuments of the nates *. There proceeds a nerve fomewhat more important than thefe from the third facral nerve, â€¢viz. the nervus pudendus. This nerve paffes out above the fhort fa- cro-ifchiatic ligament, and re-enters under the long facro-ifchiatic ligament. It then runs by the fide of the ramus ifchii, and afcends in the perineum and branches to the ereflor penis, accelerator urinse, and tranfverfalis perenei, and paffes on to the integuments and external parts of generation. * Branches of that root of the ifchiatic nerve which is derived from the third facral nerve, go alfo out to the buttock; and fome deferibe a fuperior, middle, and inferior cutantous nerve of the pat eL , OF

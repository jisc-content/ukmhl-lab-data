OF THE SENSE OF SMELLING. 455 cavities enlarge as they proceed inward, and open backward into the throat, and, confequently, commu- nicate with the mouth. They extend upward and Tideways into the Cells of the bones of the face ; and the petuitary membrane is much extended over the furfaces of thefe winding paffages, and over the ir- regular furfaces of the nofe, formed by the project- ing cartilages of the cethmoid and lower fpongy bones; which, alfo, have already been fufficiently defcribed. The cavities of the nofe lead into many cells in the bones of the face, which, if not fubfervient to the organ, afflfl in giving vibration and tone to the voice. The cavities of the nofe are continued upwards into the frontal fmufes, and into the cells of the cethmoid bone; backward and upward into the fphenoid fmus ; and upon the Tides into the antra higmoriana or Tinufes of the upper maxillary bones. The membrane covering the furface of thefe bones is called the membrana scfineideriana, the mu- cous or pituitary membrane. It is of a glandular ItruCture, pr is lubricated by the mucus difeharged by the folicules on its furface. This fecretion on the furface of the membrane, is to defend its delicate and fenfible ftrugture from the effects of the air, rwhile it preferves the fenfibility of the furface and the delicate expanded nerve. It Teems of a nature to allow the effluvia to penetrate it. It appears to me, that a very particular provifion has been made againft the too powerful effect of fmells while the membrane is inflamed, and, confequently, in a ftate of great fenfibility. When the membrane is Ii h 2 inflamed,

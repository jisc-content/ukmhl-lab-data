OF THE VEINS OF THE BRAIN. 71 We ought not to confound the idea of incompreffi- bility of the brain with that of a folid fubftance, which would allow no motion in the veffels within the cranium, and would require us to invent fome fpecious means to account for the circulation of the blood in the brain, different from that of the other vifcera of the body. Were the brain thus incompreffible, or rather folid, fo as to prevent a free adtion of the veffels within the cra- nium, then, as the blood enters with an evident pulfa- tion, it muff neceffarily have returned by the veins with a diftindt pulfation; but this pulfation is loft here, as in the other veffels of the body, before it returns by the fmufes. When the blood is fent into the arteries of the brain, by the ftroke of the heart, they dilate j and this dilatation the pliability of the brain allows, by throwing a comparative degree of preffure upon the veins. Again, when the arteries (during the dilatation of the heart) are in adtion, and contradt, their blood enters the veins, fo as to give to them a degree of dila- tation equivalent to their former compreffion, and which now gives the freedom of contraction in return to the arteries; without any compreffion, therefore, of the brain into a leffer fpace, there is an activity allowed in the veffels. This degree of motion, communicated through the brain, is very /mall, nor does it affedt the fundtion of the brain; as we fee, when the fcull is laid open, and the pulfations of the arteries are, as it were, accumulat- ed, in their effedt, to one point; for here the patient does not fuffer, although the brain beats fo as to be fenfible to the eye.

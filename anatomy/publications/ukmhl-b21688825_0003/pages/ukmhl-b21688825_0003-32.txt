When prefled they give out a fluid ; but in this they do not differ from the loofe common cellular membrane. As they are chiefly feen along the line of the great fmus, and are not fcattered over the whole dura mater, their fuppofed ufe of moirtening the furface of the mem- brane f is quite improbable; and, indeed, this is a part of that unfounded hypothefis which fuppofed an interftice betwixt the dura mater and fcull, and afcribed motion to this membrane. The furfaces of the dura and pia mater, where they are in contaft, being of the nature of the fecreting furfaces of the inverting membranes of the other vifcera, require no fuch further aid in moiften- Ing them, or preventing their adherton. Many glands are defcribed by authors in the fubftance, and upon both furfaces of the membrane J. Of the bodies which adhere to the furface of the pia mater, and of thofe alfo which are to be feen in the rtnufes, we Ihall fpeak aft tervvards, when conrtdering the veins which enter the longitudinal fmus.

This membrane muft neceflarily be fupplied with velfels for its own nourifhment, for that of the conti- guous bone, and for the perpetual exudation of the fluid, or halitus rather, which moiftens or bedews its internal furface.

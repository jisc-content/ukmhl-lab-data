The me- dulla oblongata is marked at its upper end by a deep fulcus dividing it from the pons varolii; but towards the fpinal cavity it decreafes in thicknefs, and there is no natural diftin&ion or fulcus to mark the point where the medulla oblongata ends, and the medulla fpinalis be- gins ; nor perhaps is the medulla oblongata to be con- fidered in any other light than as the beginning of the fpinal marrow. When it palTes the foramen magnum, it ceafes to be called the medulla oblongata. We have to obferve four emminences upon the me- dulla oblongata, viz. two corpora pyramidalia, and two corpora olivaria. The corpora pyramidalia, fo called from their fhape, are thofe in the middle. There is formed betwixt them and the pons varolii (being three tubercles placed together) a little fulcus, which fome have called the foramen cascum. Betwixt thefe em- minences there is a longitudinal Allure, in the bottom of which there may be obferved tranfverfe little cords, which are like commiflures conne&ing the two fides of the medulla oblongata. The corpora olivaria lie upon the fides of the corpora pyramidalia. They are in fome degree, like them, limited by the fulcus which bounds the pons va? rolii, rounded above and bulging, but gradually fub- fiding, at their lower part, into the level of the medut’a fpinalis j yet they are internally different, for anatomifts had obferved a mixture of a yellow or cineritious co- loured matter in the corpora olivaria, but Vicq d’Azyr has obferved a regular oval medullary fubftance, or body furrounded with cineritious coloured fubftance, like a miniature-reprefentation of the cerebrum itfelf; he

385 OF THE EARS OF ANIMAL'S. We may conclude, then, that fifties have no external opening like terreftrial animals ; that, inftead of this outward provifion, they have the moveable bone within the organ. Although the cartilaginous hikes have a membrane extended over part of the organ, which, in the fpinous hikes, is completely furrounded with bone,^ it is not to be conhaered as capable of the tremulous motions of the membrana tympani of terreftrial ani- mals, but may be confidered as analogous to the mem- brana feneftrse ovalis: and, fince it lies deep under the integuments, we have no reafon to believe that found is tranfmitted to the organ of hearing in hikes, any otherways than through the general vibration of the head. The organ of hearing in amphibious animals, de- monftrates- to us a difference in the manner in which the fenfation is received ; for they have both the outer membrane to receive the vibration of the air, and a mechanifm of fmall bones to convey this motion into the feat of the fenfe; and they have, behdes, within the ear itfelf, a chalky concretion ; a provifion plainly intended for propagating the motion communicated through the water. In ferpents, birds, and opiadrupeds, we lhall hereafter trace the various gradations in the perfedfion of this organ. We lhall find, that, as the animal rifes in the fcale, the cavities and tubes of the ear are extended and varied in their form. Now, I conceive thaty while the multiplied forms of the tubes ana fphericles of the internal ear afford a more expanded and fufceptible furface for receiving impreflions, the confonant forms of

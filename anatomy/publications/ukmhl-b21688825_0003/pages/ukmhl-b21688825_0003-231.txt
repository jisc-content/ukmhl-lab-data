OF THE PARTICULAR NERVES. 205 internal cutaneous nerve is given off. This nerve runs down even to the infide of the calf of the leg.â€”The external and posterior cutaneous nerve is a branch fent off from the ifchiatic nerve, after it has defcended from under the gluteus maximus, and juft before its divifion into two fafciculi, viz. the tibiah and peroneal nerves. This external and pofte- rior cutaneous nerve paffes down upon the integuments of the back part and outftde of the leg. OF THE TRUNK OF THE ISCHIATIC NERVE IN THE THIGH. But we muft not allow thefe leffer branches to diT- tracl our attention from the general courfe of the great nerve, which paffes over the gemini mufcles, betwixt the tuberoftty of the ifchium and the trochanter major, then runs deep under the bellies of the hamftring muf- cles, and is lodged immediately in the great cavity be- hind the knee-joint, in company with the popliteal ar- tery and vein. In this courfe the facro-fciatic gives off branches to the quadratus femoris, the biceps cruris, femitendinofus, and femimembranofus and triceps. A little below the middle of the thigh, the great ifchiatic nerve divides into the internal and greater, and the leffer and external popliteal nerves. But as this is really the divifion into the two great nerves of the leg, we take the more determinate names of tibial and n- bular nerves. TIBIAL NERVE.

5§ Of THE VEINS OF THE BRAIN. preferring it from compreflion) upon one fide of the falx. It very often takes a waving courfe upon the falx ; while it receives veins, which branch in the fubltance of the falx, and form communications be- twixt it and the fuperior longitudinal fmus* It opens into the ftraight or internal finus, near the edge of the tentorium. OF THE INTERNAL, STRAIGHT, OR FOURTH SINUS*. I would call this the internal fmus, from its fitua- tion, but more particularly from its receiving the veins from the internal part of the brain. This finus is formed chiefly by the vena galeni; which, coming out from betwixt the corpus collofum and tuberculi qua- drigemini, enters betwixt the lamina of the middle part of the tentorium, where it is united to the falx ; fa that by the tenfion of thefe two partitions this finus is drawn into a triangular form, and is as incomprefli- ble as thofe finufes which run connected with the bone. It opens, for the moll part, by an oval mouth, formed by ftrong pillars of fibres, into the left lateral finus, rather than directly in the middle of the com- munication of the three great finufes. We fliall find this like the other finufes fuffering confiderable variety; or irregular fmaller finufes will often be found running betwixt the lamina of the tentorium. * Sinus quartus, Perpendicularis. Haller—The fourth finus; the two lateral being the firft and fecond, and the longitudinal being the third fmus. r POSTERIOR

OF THE PELLUCID MEMBRANES. n n 'j * i thefe J CHAP. IX. i OF THE VASCULARITY OF THE PELLUCID MEMBRANES. If we cut through the fclerotic and choroid coat, round the optic nerve as it enters the eye, and after- wards cut up the outer coats towards the cornea, the humors fall out from thefe coats, and will .remain fuf- pended in a fluid, hanging by the optic nerve and clofely embraced by the retina : we have now to review7 thefe parts taken collectively, indcpendant of the outward and proper coats, and, as I have clafled them, as conftituting the internal globe of the eye. The firft peculiarity wdiich ftrikes us here is the per- fect tranfparency of all the parts within the embrace of the retina. As there are, in the adult and healthy eye, no veflels to be feen in the tranfparent membrane and humors, it becomes a queftion, whether nature has provided' for the fupport and nourifhment of thofe parts by other means than the common circulation of red blood through veflels ? Now7, I am inclined to think, that there is no fuch circulation through them; and I believe, that this would be much more generally allowed, were there not fomething like a proof remain- ing in menâ€™s minds that thefe humors and tunics were fupplied with red blood in the foetus ; whence they de- duce the natural confequence that, in the adult ftate,

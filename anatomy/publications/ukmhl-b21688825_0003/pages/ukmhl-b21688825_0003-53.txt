OF THE MEMBRANES OF THE BRAIN. 33 the arteries of the cineritious fubftance to be more mi- nute than thofe which are diftributed to the microfco- pical corpufculi of the fmalleft vifible infeft, there muft ftill remain fome part, which is not compofed of veffels ; and in regard to the veins of the cineritious fubftance we may appeal to Albinus, who, from the fubftance of the brain, finds many veins connected with the arteries of the cineritious fubftance when he carefully lifts the pia mater. But there is this peculiarity in the diftri- bution of the blood veffels of the brain, that, though the cineritious fubftance be the moft vafcular, yet, in the medullary matter, we fee the veffels with large open mouths, and more diftind; than in the cineritious fub- ftance. In following the blood veffels from the bafe of the brain into the medullary fubftance, we fee them diftintt, and of confiderable magnitude; but when they are about to enter the cineritious fubftance, they difperfe into minute branches *. In the fame manner thofe arteries, which are carried into the fulci of the furface by the pia mater, branch into extreme * Leeuwenhoeck favv, in the fubftance of the brain, but efpecially in the cortical fubftance, red blood veffels, but fo delicate, that he could not comprehend how the globules of the red blood could pals along them ; and what appeared more particular, they were of a deeper colour than the red particles themfclves ; for, when feen lingly, they appeared to have very little colour. This he explained by an experi- ment made upon a certain little animal. After it had fucked blood very plentifully, he obferved, that the blood was broken down by digeftion, and conveyed through the limbs and horns of the crea- ture, fo as to make it univerfally red. So here he conceives that the globules of the blood may be broken down and altered in their lhape to enter the minute veffels of the brain* Yol. Ill* D minute-

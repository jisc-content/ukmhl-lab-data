OF THE HUMAN EAR. 415 is owing to the greater or lefs degree of nicety with which the mufcles of the malleus render the mufcular membrane capable of being truly adjufted ; if the tenfion be perfed, all the vibrations produced by the adion of the radiated mufcle will be equally corred, and the ear truly mufical. Mr. Home proceeds upon the idea, that the mem- brane of the tympanum is like a mufical inftrument, or, as he expreffes himfelf, like a monochord ; but he is fundamentally wrong in fuppofing, that it requires a more delicate organ to be perceptible of mufical tones than of articulate founds or language. / In the firft place, we may require an explanation of the ufe of that mufcle which is inferted into the ftapes. This ftapedius mufcle would feem to have the fame ufe, and to affed that bone in the fame manner, in which the mufcles of the malleus affed it. Surely Mr. Home will not go fo far as to fay, that the mem- brana feneftrae ovalis is alfo mufcular. It may be further worthy of attention, in confidering this fubjed, that whatever affeds the membrane of the tympanum, affeds, alfo, the membrane of the veflibule; that, if the one be relaxed, the other is rendered tenfe, from the clofe connedion that exifts between them through the chain of bones. In the paper already quoted, the following cafe is given, as illuftrating the manner in which the lof$ of the natural adion of the mufcles affeds the ear, in regard to its capacity for mufic. A gentleman, thirty- three years of age, who poffeffed a very corred ear, fo as to be capable of Tinging in concert, though he' had never learned mufic, was fuddeply feized with a giddinefs

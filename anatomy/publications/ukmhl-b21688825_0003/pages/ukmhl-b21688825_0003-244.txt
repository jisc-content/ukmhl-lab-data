220 Of THE SENSES. There are more frequent inltances of difeafed cor- poreal fenfation in hypocondriacs. In them, the fen- faiion of pain and unufual feelings are falfely attributed to parts in which there is really no affection : for thefe feelings there is no apparent caufe ; they proceed from a difordered flate of fenfation in which the ufual courle* of the impreffions is altered, fo as to occafion the patient falfely to attribute his fuffering to found and healthy parts. Thus indigeftion, the irritation of the bile, flatulency, colic, &c. often do not give the ufual im- preffions, but the pains are attributed to outward parts. That there is fometimes an adlual connection exifling betwixt the external parts, to which thefe feelings are - referred, and the internal organs, is evident from the fact, that preffure in the outward and found parts has occafioned fpafms in the internal organs. To fuch difordered tranfmiffion of the irritation of the internal parts we have to attribute the extravagant and ludi- crous ideas which hypocondriacs entertain. In thefe people, there are difeafes of parts, of the adtion of which, during their healthy flate, (as I have already explained in the fhort introdudlory view of the ner- vous fyflernj, we have no feeling nor confcioufnefs, and over which the will has no power. But although in the healthy flate of the oeconomy there is no immedi- ate route by which any fenfation from thefe organs can be tranfmitted to excite a mental perception, it may happen, that, in their difeafed flate, when fenfations do -rife which forcibly attradl the attention, there fhould be 1 obfcurity in the feelings produced by their derange- snt, infomuch, that the mind may be deceivedâ€™m regard

Thefe fa£ts were once of im- portance, though more accurate obfervation has now made them fuperfiuous. The Abbe Nollet took much pains to decide the queftion, whether water was a me- dium for found. After confiderable preparation, and acquiring a dexterous management of himfelf in the water, (for which he takes great merit to himfelf), he found that he could hear under water the found of the human voice, and even diftinguifh converfation and mufic. The human ear being an organ imperfectly adapted to this medium of found, thefe experiments do not inform us of the relative powers of air and water in the tranfmiffion of found. But another experiment of the Abbe Nollet proves, what indeed to me is fuffi- ciently evident, from the ftructure of the ear of fiihes, viz. that the water tranfmits a much ftronger vibration than the air. When he funk under water and ftruck together two {tones which he held in his hands, it gave a {hock to his ear which was infupportable, and which was felt on all the furface of his body, like that fenfa- tion which is produced when a folid body held in the “ udito fcoperli nel Granchlo Paguro.” “ Propriis obfervat'ionibus “ certior faftus afferit, obfcura nofte, placidoque mari, quoties “ pifcatores ardentibus faculis paguri in littore haerentis oculos “ lucis fulgore perftringunt, ut ftupido, et pene prsftigiato ani- “ male potiantur, fi forte rumor aliquis ingruit.

210 OF THE PARTICULAR NERVES. ing cut from under it, continues its courfe beneath the flrong aponeurofis, which covers the mufcles on the fore part of the leg. It then pierces the aponeurofis and becomes cutaneous, and runs obliquely down to the convexity of the foot, giving off in its courfe a nerve which paifes over the outer ancle. THE METATARSAL NERVES. When the fuperficial branch of the peroneal nerve defcends before the ancle-joint, it divides into the me- tatarfal nerves, or the rami dorfales pedis. The ex- ternal of thofe branches pafles above the tendons, and above the tendinous expanfion on the dorfum pe- dis ; is united to the extreme branches of the ramus communicans tibiei, and is finally diflributed to the outfide of the third . toe, to the fourth, and to the in- fide of the little toe.â€”The internal branch is again fubdivided; one branch extends over the middle of the foot to the fecond and third toes, while the other paifes llraight along the metatarfal bone of the great toe (above the tendons); fends many branches over the infide of the foot, and terminates on the infide and dorfum of the great toe.

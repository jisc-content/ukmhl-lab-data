The posterior petrous sinus * lies in that pointed extremity of the tentorium, which ftretches forward, connected with the acute angle of the pe- trous bone. It is narrow; and a fulcus or groove on the angle of the bone gives a partial lodgement to it; it paffes from the cavernous finus to the great lateral finus. The lateral basilar sinus f is fhorter and larger than the lalt; and it makes an oblique curve from the cavernous finus under the pointed extremity of the tentorium, which is continued by the fide of the fella turcica, to the termination of the lateral finus, or rather into the beginning of the jugular vein, by a ehannel, feparated by a boney lamina from the ter- mination of the lateral finus; or it is continued into a vein in the bafe of the cranium, which afterwards joins the great jugular vein.

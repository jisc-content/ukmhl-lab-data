SO OF THE MEMBRANES OF THE BRAIN. OF The motion caufed by refpiration was likewife ob- ferved*. M. de Lamure’s conclufion was, that the motion of the brain was caufed by the reflux of the blood towards it from the vena cava in expiration f. He undertook to demonftrate ,this; and he conceived his proof to be good, when, by prefling the ribs of a fubjeet, he faw the refluent blood fwelling the jugular and abdominal cava. Haller obferved the jugular veins fwell, and become turgid, during expiration; and be concluded, that the motion of the brain was occafioned by the refluent blood diftending the finufes of the brain. But he did not believe, as Lamure did, that this motion took place before the opening of the cranium, as well as after it. When the fculi is opened by a wound, the dura mater (till protects the brain, refilling inflammation, and giving the neceflary and uniform fupport to the more delicate fubflance and vafcular membrane of the brain; but when, the dura mater is lacerated by the trepan, or punctured, or worn by the pulfation againft the edge of the bone, there may be hidden hasmia of part of the brain from coughing, or a rapid and difeafed growth from the pia mater forming a fungus. Such fungus is, in feme degree peculiar to children, and is occafioned, I conceive, by the taking away of that due ccmpreffion which the refiftance of the dura mater ought to give. * M.

Thus, a very fmall degree of motion communicated by the head of the malleus to the body of the incus, mud be greatly encreafed in the extremity of the long procefs-of the incus, and, confequently, this mechanifm of the bones effentially affifls in giving flrength to the vibration which is tranfmitted inward to the feat of the nerve. The os orbiculare Hands fimply as a link of commu- nication betwixt the extremity of the incus and the upper part of the flapes, and its ufe is evidently to promote the accurate and perpendicular motion of this long lever of the incus upon the head of the flapes: for, if this bone had not been fo placed, the motion of the long lever of the incus mufl have given an obliquity to the impuife upon the flapes. The bafe of the flapes almofl completely fills up the foramen ovale. It is feated on a membrane which is flretched over the foramen The flapes, then, acts like a piflon on a membrane of much lefs circumference than that of the membiana tympani. From all which confiderations, we may learn how much, and how flrongly, the agi- tation of the air in the outer canal of the ear is en- * VaTfalva has the following obfervation ; fee page 24.

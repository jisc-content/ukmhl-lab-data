OB THE ORGAN OF HEARING. 393 circular canals, with ampullulae, and a common belly connecting them. In this animal, then, it is evident, the ear is fimilar in ftru&ure to that of the cartilagi- nous fHhea *. In the frog, the outward apparatus is different, "but the internal ear is fimple f. Under the fkin of the fide of the head, a little behind the prominent eye, we find a large circular opening, which tends inward in a funnel-like form: and from the upper part of the circle of this meatus we find a fmall elaftic bone, or Cartilage fufpended. This bone is in contaCl with the common integuments of the head, which are flretched over the little cavity. This firft bone is placed at a right angle with a fecond bone, and both are lodged in a proper tympanum J. This fecond bone fwells out towards its inner extremity, and is accurately ap- plied to the foramen ovale. The foramen ovale opens into a cavity which we mull call the veftibule, and which, in this creature, is peculiarly large in proportion to its fize. This veftibule contains a fac, upon which the nerve is expanded : it contains alfo a chalky foft concretion, which is of a beautiful whitenefs, and of a * It is laid by naturalifls, that the falamander never has been heard to utter a cry; and as dumbnefs is in general coupled with deafnefs, it is natural to fuppofe it has no ears. This is to confider the organ as fubfement to converfation ! f See plate, fig. 5 and 6. f This tympanum, being a cavity containing air, has communi- cation with the mouth by a tube, which we fhall afterwards find called euftachian tube. Several have erroneoully described this â– fcwimal as receiving founds through the mouth. Ddj regular

I OF THE PELLUCID MEMBRANE. An eye, which I had lately an opportunity of ex- amining, confirmed me in this ppinion. I afiifted my brother in an operation on the eye, in which, the an- terior part being difeafed, it was cut away. I had fooil an opportunity of retiring and examining the parts with Dr. Monro. I obferved, then, an opaque fpot on the pofterior furface of the lens, which was, indeed, in the capfule, and to this fpot there came veflels over the margin of the lens from the extremities of the velfels of the retina ; but, in the vitreous humor, there were no velfels to be feen, nor any branches palling into the lens obliquely from behind, as they do in the foetus. / Z

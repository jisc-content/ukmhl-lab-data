144 0F TKE particular nerves. . ' i glands. The trunk of the nerve having efcaped from the cranium, lies covered by the external pterigoid muf- cle; and is at this point divided into two great branches, which again fubdivide into numerous fmall branches; many of which it would be fuperfluous to defcribe. It is fufficient to mention them as going, i, to the maf- feter mufcle ; 2, to the zygomatic folfa and temporal mufcles ; 3, to the buccinator mufcle. We regard as the two greater divifions of the lower maxillary nerve; firft, The proper nerve which pafies into the lower jaw; and, fecondly, The guftatory or lingual nerve. The divifion into thefe two great branches is formed, after the nerve has palled betwixt the pterigoid mufcles. The gustatory nerve, immediately after its fepa- ration from the nerve of the lower jaw, is joined by the chorda tympani; or, perhaps we Ihould rather fay, a branch of this nerve, by traverfmg the petrous por- tion of the temporal bone in a retrograde dire&ion, unites itfelf wTith the portio dura of the feventh pair, as it is palling through, the ear. This nerve being feen palling acrofs the tympanum, is the reafon of its being called, chorda tympani. The guftatory nerve, pro- ceeding obliquely downward, fends oif twigs to the fa- livary glands and mufcles, fituated betwixt the jaw- bone and tongue. Where it is palling by the fide of the maxillary gland, it gives out fome filaments which form a fmall ganglion, from which branches penetrate the gland. The trunk then proceeding onward betwixt the fublingual gland and the mufculus hyoglolfus, feveral twigs are fent off, which form a kind of plexus amongft the mufcles and felivary glands 5 and com- 4 municating

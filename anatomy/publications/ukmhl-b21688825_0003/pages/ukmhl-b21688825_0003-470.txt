446 OF HEARING IN GENERAL. centrate, and encreafe the tremors of the external air, and render the flighter impreflions audible. It would appear, that the fimple fac’ of the veflibule is fufficient to receive the impreflion in fome animals, and that in many the veftibule and femicircular canals form folely the organ of hearing. It is evident, there- fore, that thefe are the molt efiential parts. We fee alfo an intention in the ftridt fimilarity of figure and place in thefe canals through all the varieties of animals* from fifhe's to man. It would feem to indicate, that there is in their form and pofition a peculiar pro- vifion for the ofciliation of found producing the full effect. We find, however, that the cochlea is imperfedt in birds; and that it is fully formed only in man, and in quadrupeds: we muft, therefore, conclude, that it is fubfervient to the more exquifite fenfations. I do not conceive that the cochlea or any part of the organ particularly conduces to the, bellowing of a mufical ear, although it is by hearing that we are capable of the perceptions of melody and harmony, and of all the charms of mufic ; yet it would feem, that this depends upon the mind, and is not an operation confined to the organ. It is enjoyed in a very different degree by thofe whofe fimple faculty of hearing is equally perfefl *. Even after ftudying, with all diligence, the ana- tomical flru&ure of the ear, we cannot but be aftonifhed with the varieties to be found in the fenfation; for ex- * See Reid’s.Enquiry. ample;

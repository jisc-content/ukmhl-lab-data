I30 OF THE PARTICULAR NERVES* Although branches of the opthalmic, pterigoid, pala- tine, and fuborbital nerves pafs to the membrane of the nofe, there is reafon to believe that they have no power of conveying the impreffion of odours. Thefe nerves are neceffary that the membrane may poffefs the common properties bellowed by the nerves. Upon the queltion, whether thofe additional branches of nerves to the nofe, affifl in conveying the impreffion of odours, there has been much controverfy. It is a fubjeCt upon which we might reafon by analogy; but, certainly, little dependence can be placed upon thofe cafes brought by either party, of dileafes affecting the one fet of nerves without influencing the other. From the nature of the parts, ulceration or tumors, which deftroy the bones of the nofe, mull prcfs equally upon the branches of the olfaCtory nerve, and of the fifth pair. We find that there pafs alfo to the other organs of fenfe, fubordinate nerves; and we know that a nerve may be modified to much variety of function; and this is evident from the nerve of tafle being a branch of the fifth pair. But it is doubtful how far a nerve may be capable of receiving at one inflant various im- preflions. Far from confidering diflinCt nerves fent to the fame organ, as affording an argument for thefe nerves receiving one uniform impreffion, and conveying one fimple fenfation, it would feem more rational to infer, that one individual nerve cannot per- form two funftions, and that two functions are often required in the organs of fenfe. I am inclined to be- lieve, that, the olfaCtory nerve is incapable of bellowing common fenfation on the membrane of the nofe; and that-

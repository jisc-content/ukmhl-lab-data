DISTANCE OF OBJECTS. 339 rum, have all their lhare in accommodating it to the diftance of obje&s, and in giving perfect vifion. Very ingenious experiments are made by Dr. Young*, to determine whether there be any change in the length of the axis of the eye-ball. He confiders it as neceffary, to account for the power of the eye in adapting it to the diftance of obje&s, that the diameter ftiould be en- larged one feventh ; its tranfverfe diameter diminilhed one fourteenth; and the femi-diameter fhortened one thirtieth of an inch. To determine this he fixed the eye, and at the fame time he forced in upon the ball of the eye the ring of a key, fo as to caufe a phantom very accurately defined to extend within the field of perfe£l vifion; then looking to bodies at different dif- tances, he expected, if the figure of the eye was altered, that the fpot, caufed by the preffure, would be altered in ftiape and dimenfions; he expended that, inftead of an increafe of the length of the eye’s axis, the oval fpot caufed by the preffure of the key, refilling this elon- gation, Ihould have fpread over a fpace at leaft ten times as large as the molt fenfible part of the retina: but no fuch effect took place; the power of accom- modation was as extenfive as ever, and there was no perceptible change either in the fize or in the figure of the oval fpot. Again, he placed two candles fo as exactly to anfwer to the extent of the termination of the optic nerve; he marked accurately the point to which the eye was diredled ; he then made the utmoft change in its focal length: expecting that, if there were any elongation of the axis, the external candle * Philof.

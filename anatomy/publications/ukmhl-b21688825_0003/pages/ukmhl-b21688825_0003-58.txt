38 OF THE MEMBRANES OF THE BRAIN. the immediate effect of injuries, that ftridt fympathy and univerfal connection which belong to the nerves. The nearer to its fource that a nerve is pricked, the greater is the effect of the injury. As it recedes from its origin towards the fuperficies of the brain, the effedt is lefiened, becaufe the connections of the part are diminifhed in number, proportionally to their dis- tance from the central parts of the brain; a pundture in the centre injures more filaments from their being concentrated to form nerves. Several ounces of the brain have been loft in con- fequence of wounds, without death, or lofs of me- mory, or intelledt. There is a very marked diftindtion betwixt pundtu- ring, cutting, or even burning, the furface of the brain and prefling it. In the firft there is little or no effedt, or even pain. In the latter there is ftupor, pain, or convulftons. The reafon is, that in the firft it is a local irritation in a place which has little, if any, feeling, while in the latter, the effedt of the preflure fpreads extenfively. No fenfible man will expedt, in the moft minute and unwearied inveftigation of the ftrudture of the brain, to find the explanation of its fundtion. It is interefting to find effedts fo peculiarly connected with the opera- tions of the mind, depending upon a ftrudture cf fo grofs and animal a nature as this of the brain, fo far as we have feen; but ftill, all explanation of thofe opera* tions muft be viftonary.

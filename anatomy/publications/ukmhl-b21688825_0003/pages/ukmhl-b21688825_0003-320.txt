OF THE RETINA. 29 6 fhut:, the pupil of the other eye will dilate ; if the hand be put over the eye-lids of the fhut eye, the pupil will flill further dilate *. k We find feveral inflances of vifion indiftinCt during full day-light, and perfect in the crepufculum. This we have explained by the dilatation of the pupil allow- ing the rays of light to pafs the partial opacity of the lens ; it, of courfe, has no connection with the difeafe of the retina. There are alfo inflances of vifion being more than naturally obfcure in the twilight, which is owing to a degree of infenfibility f. The night blindnefs, how- ever, is not to be entirely attributed to a degree of con- tinued infenfibility in the nerve. The attacks are irregular, and allied to the intermitting amaurofis. It has been epidemic, and the following cafes feem to ally it with the paralytic affeCtions. * The fympathy of the iris with the retina I do not conceive to be immediate, but through the'intervention of the brain ; and the degree of dilatation of the pupil, I thould hold to depend on the ftrength of the common fenfation of both eyes. By this only can we account for the fenfibility of the retina of one eye affefting the iris of the other, or the difturbance of the brain, in comatofe difeales, deftroying the fympathetic connexion betwixt the retina and pupil. f Eft immanis differentia inter fplendorem et aftivitatem luminis candelas et lunse : luminis folaris vis eft ad vim luminis candelae 16 pedes diftantis, obfervante D.

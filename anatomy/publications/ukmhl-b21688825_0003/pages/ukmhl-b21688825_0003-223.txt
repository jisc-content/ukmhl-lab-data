OF THE PARTICULAR, NERVES. I97 The EXTERNAL CUTANEOUS NERVE IS that which conies out from the belly near the fuperior fpinous procefs of the ilium. It divides airnoft imme- diately into two great branches, and in the front view of the thigh the anterior branch alone is to be feen. It takes a courfe above the fafcia in the direction of the' .line which divides the vaflus externus from the redlus femoris, and terminates near the knee, while the polterior branch paffes over the tenfor vaginae femoris, and down upon the outfide and back of the thigh. It is derived from the third lumbar nerve. The middle cutaneous nerve rifes from amongfl the integuments of the groin, and emerges from under the fafcia near the upper edge of the fartorius mufcle. It paffes down upon the redtus mufcle, and is diftri- buted to the integuments in three or four divifions. The anterior cutaneous nerve comes out to the integuments very high up, and in the middle of the groin betwixt the pubes and tuberofity of the os ilii. It paffes down the thigh along the furfaces of the far- torius and vaflus internus mufcles. This, like all the other cutaneous nerves, runs along above the fafcia, and on the lower furface of the fkin. The internal cutaneous nerve is the lead re- gular. It does not pierce the fafcia in one trunk, but fends three, four, or five branches through the fafcia, which are diftributed to the integuments on the infide of the thigh. Some of thefe, after running a confider- able way under the fafcia, emerge and encircle the in- fide of the knee. Befides thefe more remarkable cutaneous nerves, there come down fmall nerves to the groin and fcro- Q 3 turn*

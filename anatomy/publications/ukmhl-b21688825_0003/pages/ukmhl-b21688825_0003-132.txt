106 or THE VENTRICLES OP THE BRAIN. The firft appearance which ftrikes us is the great pro- portion of the medullary matter in the bafe of the brain; the whole furface of the brain, while feen from above, was dneritious, but now the centrical medullary part of the brain is feen emerging from the envelopement of the cineritious matter, and, gathering together from the fe- veral internal medullary proceffes of the brain, it con- centrates the effential properties of the encephalon, and is fitted to give out the feveral nerves. Thofe great me- dullary prolongations of the cerebrum and cerebellum, are called the crura. The crura cerebri are compofed of a white fibrous medullary matter, in which alfo there is a mix- ture of cineritious fubftance. They are formed from the whole central medullary part of the cerebrum ; or more immediately from the inferior and lateral part of the corpora ftriata, and from the fuperior and inter- nal part of the thalami nervorum opticorum; and, from the conflux of medullary matter, from the ante- rior and pofterior lobes of the cerebrum. From all thefe various parts the medullary matter, palling downwards and backwards, forms the crura *. The crus of either fide of the brain, cantrading their diameters, unite at an acute angle, and are united to the pons varolii, or nodus cerebri, formed by the crura cerebelli; they pafs on to' form the medulla oblongata, and, as they unite with ity they raife it into the eminences, called Corpora Pyrami- dalia. In thofe proceffes of the cerebrum, the cineritious and medullary fubftances mingle with fome degree of * I fpeak ft ill of the relation of thofe to each other, according to t&eir natural fituation in the fcull. confufion;

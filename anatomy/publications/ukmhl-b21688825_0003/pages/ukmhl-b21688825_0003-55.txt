OF THE MEMBRANES OF THE BRAIN. 35 R. della Torre, in his nucrofcopical obfervations, de- Fcribes globuli in the brain; he fays, that he faw them floating in a pellucid vifcous fluid. But Pro- chafka # thinks Della Torre mud be miftaken in this, for when he took a fmali portion of the brain, he faw it confiding of innumerable globules, which continued to adhere to* each other, even after three monthsâ€™ maceration in Vrater: and thence he con- cludes, that it could not be as R. ddlla Torre conceived, that thefe fpherical bodies move from the brain. on towards the extremities of the nerves; nor do thefe bodies lie imbeded in a glutinous fluid (he continues) but they are connected by the extremely minute and pellucid fepimentas of the pia mater, and by the velfels which pervade both the cortical and medullary matter, and which nouriflh as well as fupport and conned thefe corpufculi. Prochaika cannot, from his own obfervations, de- termine whether thefe globular bodies be convoluted veflels, or what they are. R. della Torre had obferved, that they were larged in the cortical part, lefs in the medullary fubftance, dill diminiflbing in the medulla oblongata, and lead of all in the nerves; but fucceeding obfervation did not fupport this aflertion f. Mala- carne exprefles himfelf to be nearly of the fame opinion in regard to the vehicular drudure of the cortical fub- ftance of the brain. The minute precedes of the pia mater, fays he, embracd and fupport the medullary fub- * Traft. Anatom, de Struft. Nervorum. f This was certainly a theoretical deception : it is like the accu- rate obfervation of Tracaffati, who could diftinguilh a difference of taffe in the medullary and cineritious fubftance of the brain.

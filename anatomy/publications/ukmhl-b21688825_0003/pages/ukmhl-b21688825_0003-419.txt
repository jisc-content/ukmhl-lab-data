OF THE ORGAN OF HEARING. 395 bule; and a paflage alfo opens from the cavity of the tympanum into the fauces. In this animal, as in. all which we have clafled under the prefent divifion, the internal ear confifts of a central cavity, or vefli- bule, which contains a fac with fluid, and cretaceous matter, and of three femicircular canals conneded by a common belly. This common belly of the femicircular canals has no communication with the facculus veftibuli which contains the cretaceous matter, further than as it lies in contad with it, and as they both lie fur- rounded by a fluid ; they equally receive the impref- fion of the littie bony column, the extremity of which vibrates in the foramen ovale. There being enumerated forty or more varieties of the lacerta or lizard, many of thefe have very different habits. Some of them never pafs into the water, but inhabit dry and dufty places. The lacerta agilis, or common green lizard, which is a native both of Europe and of India, is nimble, and balks, during the hot weather, on the trunks of old trees and on dry banks; but on hearing a noife, it retreats quickly to its hole. It has the {kin over the tympanum ex- tremely thin, and fuch as to anfwer precifely the office of the membrane of the tympanum. So all the varieties of reptiles which, in their habits and delicacy of hear- ing, refemble terreftrial animals, have either the mem- brane of the tympanum or a {kin fo delicate as to pro-1 duce the fame effed ; while thofe, which inhabit the water, have a rough integument, or a hard fcale, drawn over the tympanum. Befides this, fome have a final! mufcle attached to the bone, which runs acrofs the tympanum j it is like the tenfor tympani, and is an- D d 4 other /

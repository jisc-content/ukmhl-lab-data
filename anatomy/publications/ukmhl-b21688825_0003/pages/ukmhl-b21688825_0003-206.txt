,l8o OF THE PARTICULAR NERVE3. ✓ nerves which come from the feat of the kidney, and which are derived from the fuperior lumbar nerves.— Thefe pafs acrofs the crura of the diaphragm, and enter into the cseliac plexus.—In purfuing the nerves of the vifcera further, we have it no longer in our power to follow individual branches, but have rather to mark the courfe, and enumerate the various fourqes of the plexus, and net-work of nerves which follow the great veffels. From the cseliac plexus, there pafs out, i, Nerves which accompany the phrenic arteries upon the lower furface of the diaphragm. 2. Nerves to the liver:—and of thefe there are two plexus, the right and left hepatic plexus ; one paffes along the vena portas, biliary duds, and right hepatic artery, to the right fide of the liver, the gall bladder and duds; this of courfe is the RIGHT HEPATIC PLEXUS : the LEFT HEPATIC PLEX- US paffes along the left hepatic artery; and this has connexion with the cardiac nerves, branches of the par vagum. 3. That plexus, which runs upon the leffer curve of the flomach, while it is formed in a great meafure by the par vagum, has alfo connexion with the folar or cseliac plexus. 4. The plexus of nerves which pafs to the lower orifice of the flomach and duodenum is chiefly a divifion of the right he- patic plexus. Thefe nerves, to the liver, flomach, and duodenum, are attached to the branches of the caeliac artery. Along the great fplenic artery, which is alfo derived from the cseliac artery, there paffes out a plexus of nerves to the fpleen. From this fplenic plexus there pafs nerves to the great omentum; and they even unite with thofe paffmg out upon the duodenum, and

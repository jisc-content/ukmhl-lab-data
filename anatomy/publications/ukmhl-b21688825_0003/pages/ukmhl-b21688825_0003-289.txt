265 OF THE IRIS. the iris to depend on the fecretion of thefe villi. But the colour of the iris depends, in a great meafure, on the black paint upon its pofterior furface finning through it; and the black and hazzel-coloured iris is owing to the greater degree of tranfparency of the iris, which allows the dark uvea to Ihine through it. The iris is acknowledged to be the moft acutely fenfible part in the body. We have, then, to expedt in its compofition, raufcular fibres, and to account for its acute irritability and fympathy, by a profufion of nerves: again, as the power of the mufcular fibre, and the fenfibility of the nerve, are both, in fome meafure, indebted to the circulation of the blood, we may expedf to find aâ€™fo a profufion of veffels in the iris. In all thefe re- fpefts, we fhali find the iris to be an object of admi- ration. OF THE MUSCULAR FIBRES OF THE IRIS. It is evident from a note, under the head corona ciliaris, that Ruyfch had obferved two fets of mufcular fibres in the iris 9 for, under the name of ciliary liga- ment, he defcribes a fet of radiated fibres which go from the ciliary precedes towards the circular margin of the pupil: he obferved alfo, the circular or orbicu- lar fibres which run round the margin of the pupil. Window fays, that between the two laminae of the uvea (viz. iris) we find two thin planes of fibres, which ap- pear to be flelhy: the fibres of one plane orbicular, and lying round the circumference of the pupil, and thofe of the other being radiated ; one extremity of it being fixed to the orbicular plane, the other to the T 3 great

OF THE MEMBRANES OF THE BRAIN. 17 down upon the internal fpine of the occipital bone from the tentorium, gradually contrafting until it terminates on the margin of the great occipital foramen. It ferves as a kind of ligament ftrengthening the tentorium, while it divides the cerebellum. It enters, however, but a little way betwixt the lobes. The falx and tentorium being conne&ed and con- tinued into each other at their broadeft part, they mutually fupport each other, and are extremely tenfe. This tenfenefs depends on their mutual fupport, for when one of them is cut the other falls loofe. OF THE SPHENOIDAL FOLDS. The lateral extremities of the tentorium are continued forward into acute lines, formed by the duplicature of the dura mater coming off from the edges of the pars petrofa of the temporal bones, and take firm hold on the pofterior clynoid proceffes. From thefe two points a fold of the membrane ftretches forward on each fide to the anterior clynoid procefs, forming thus a hollow or cell for the lodgment of the pituitary gland. Ano- ther fold or duplicature of the dura mater runs onwards a little way from the edge of the little wing of Ingra- tius. Thefe are the fphenoidal folds. Where the internal lamina of the dura mater for- fakes the external to form the falx and tentorium, it â€¢ leaves a channel or triangular canal; the bafis of which triangle is the lamina of the membrane inverting the Cranium, while the tenfion of the partitions carries the apex out into an acute point. This forms a channel for receiving all the blood of the veins, and this tenfion and triangular fhape gives a degree of incompreflibility Vol. Ill, C to

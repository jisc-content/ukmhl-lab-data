But the con- nection of ideas is in no inftance more conftant and fecret than in the ideas conveyed by fight and touch. When a folid body is prefented to view, we fee only the light and, Ihade ; but this raifes in our mind the affociated ideas from the fenfe of touch, viz. folidity, convexity, and angularity, “ the vifible idea exciting “ in us thofe tangeable ideas,” which, in the free and promifcuous exercife of our fenfes, ufually accompany it. It is thus that we attribute to the fenfe of fight >vhat is the aCt of the memory and judgment *. We have feen that the picture of an objeCt is formed in the bottom of the eye.

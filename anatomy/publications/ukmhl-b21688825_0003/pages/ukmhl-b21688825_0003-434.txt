From the larger end of the body of the bone there Hands out an acute procefs; and from the neck attaching the bulbous head to the body of the bone, there Hands out a very flender pro- cefs, which is often broken off. The great head of the bone does not form a regular ball to be focketed in the body of the incus; there are irregularities in the contiguous furfaces of both the bones. The incus * is the fecond bone of the chain ; it re- ceives its name from its refemblance to the blackfmiths anvil. It more relembles a tooth with two roots. On the furface of the body, it has a depreflion like the furface of the firH molaris. Into this depreflion of the incus the head of the malleus is received. The Ihorter of the two proceffes, and the body of the bone lie on the margin of the circular opening of the tympanum; and the acute point of this procefs is turned back into the opening of the maffoid cells. The long leg or procefs of the incus hangs down free into the tympanum f, and has attached to its point the os orbiculare. The os orbiculare is like a grain of fand, and is the fmalleff bone of the body: it is a medium of ar- ticulation betwixt the incus and Hapes. The stapes J or Hirrup is well named, for it has a very clofe refemblance to a ffirrup-iron j the little head is articulated with the os orbiculare: the arch of the bone is exadlly like that of the flirrup-iron, but elegantly grooved within, fo as to give lightnefs to the bone.

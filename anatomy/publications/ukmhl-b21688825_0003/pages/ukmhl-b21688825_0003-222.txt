J%6 OF THE PARTICULAR NERVES. great nerves are three in number. One pafies out urn der Paupart’s ligament to the extenfor mufcles of the leg, viz. thofe which lie on the fore-part of the thigh. This of courfe is called the anterior crural nerve. The fecond nerve is the obturator nerve, fo called becaufe it palfes out from the pelvis by the thyroid hole. This nerve lies amongft the deep mufcles of the thigh, and diftributes its branches chiefly to the adduftor mufcles. The third nerve is the greatefl: nerve of the body, viz. the ifchiatic nerve. It pafles out from the back part of the pelvis, through the facro-fciatic notch, and takes its courfe down the back of the thigh into the ham. In this courfe it fupplies the mufcles lying on the back of the thigh, but its chief deftination is to the leg and foot. „ OF THE CUTANEOUS NERVES OF THE THIGH. It will be found confiderably to take from the in- tricacy of the minute anatomy of the nerves of the lower extremity, to difpofe firfl: of thefe nerves which lie under the integuments of the thigh. Thefe cutaneous nerves of the thigh come from the lumbar nerves, or more immediately from the anterior crural nerve. They pierce the tendon of the oblique mufcle of the abdomen, or pafs under Paupart’s liga- ment, and are diftributed to the groin, fcrotum, and betwixt the fafcia and integuments of the fore-part of the thigh. There may be defcribed five cutaneous nerves on the fore-part of the thigh, viz. the external cutaneous, the tniddle cutaneous, the anterior cutaneous, the internal cutaneous, arid thofe of the groin and fcro- tUfil, The

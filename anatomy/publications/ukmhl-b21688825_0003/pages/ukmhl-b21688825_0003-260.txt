236 OF THE EYE. The effeft of old age, is gradually to reduce the eye to a lefs prominent ftate, and, confequently, to bring it to the reverfe of the near-fighted eye. From the decreafe of the humors, and the lefle-ned convexity of the cornea, the image of obje&s is not formed foon enough to impinge accurately on the re- tina, the rays tend to form the image behind the In this figure, we have the effedt of old age on the humors reprefented; without the intervention of the glafs a, the rays have a direction which would form the image at fome diftance beyond the retina, as at b. But by the convex glafs a, (which is of the nature of the common fpeftacles for old people), the direction of the rays of light is fo corrected, that the image falls accurately on the bottom of the eye. We underhand, then, whence thefe oppofite de- fects of fight arife ; that, in old people, objects can- not be feen diftinftly when near, and, in fhort-fighted people, they cannot be feen difiinftly when at a dif- tance. We fee, alfo, why old age correfts fhort- fightednefs by gradually reducing the convexity of the eye, enabling the perfon to fee objects farther removed, until. retina, as we fee in fig. 9,

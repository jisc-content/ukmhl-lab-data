i4« OF THE PARTICULAR NERVES* upper maxillary bone, and is diftributed to the velum palati and uvula. The fuperior maxillary nerve, after fending off the branches which form the fpheno-palatine ganglion, paffes obliquely downward to the infra orbital canal. In this courfe it gives off the pofterior nerve to the teeth of the upper jaw ; and this again gives off a twig, which takes a courfe on the outfide of the maxillary bone, and fupplies the gums and alveoli, and buccina- tor mufcle. While palling in its canal, the infra orbital nerve gives off the anterior nerve to the teeth ; and when it emerges from the infra orbital foramen, it fpreads widely to the mufcles of the face, connedling itfelf with the extremities of the portio dura of the feventh pair, or nervus communicans faciei* The “ tic douloureux,” and the “ tic convulfif,” of the French authors, are difeafes attributed to the affec- tion of this nerve. The feat of the tic douloureux, is the fide of the face, the nollril, the cheek-bone, and root of the alveoli. Sauvage calls it the trifmus dolo- rificus, or maxillaris. But it is a difeafe not abfolutely fixed to this point of the cheek-bone ; but on the con- trary, from the univerfal connection betwixt the nerves of the face, it takes, fometimes, a wide range; and the difeafe, I have no doubt, is fometimes feated in the portio dura of the feventh pair. Sauvage has given to one fpecies of it, the name of occipitalis. It is a difeafe attended with extreme pain, which forces the patient to cry out in great agony. The pain is felt deep rooted in the bones of the face, and feems to fpread upon the expanded extremities of the nerve; it

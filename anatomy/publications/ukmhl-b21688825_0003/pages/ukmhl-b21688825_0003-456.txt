432 OF THE HUMAN EAR. I fee diftinft branches of velfels rifing from the root of the lamina fpiralis, and arching on the fcalae, to the number of ten in the circle ; and, after a more minute injection, I have found the oiTeous part of the lamina fpiralis tinged red, and the membranous part of a deep fcarlet *. We have obferved the meatus auditorius in- ternus to be a large oval foramen in the poflerior furface of the pars petrofa of the temporal bone. This tube tranfmits the feventh or auditory nerve. It is about live lines in diameter, but encreafes as it palfes inward ; and appears to terminate in two deep fovea, which are divided by an acute fpine. But the audi- tory foramen only appears to terminate in thefe fovea, for they are each perforated by lefler holes, which lead into the three divifions of the labyrinth, whilll a larger one conveys a portion of the nerve through the cavi- ties of the temporal bone altogether, and out upon the fide of the face. This larger foramen is in the upper part of the fuperior and lefler fovea. It firlt afcends to near the furface of the petrous part of the temporal bonef, and then defcends and turns backward and takes a courfe round the tympanum above the foramen ovale; and clofe by the pofterior femicircular canal. Its termination is the foramen llylo maftoideum J. * In a preparation before me, I fee a confiderable artery derived from the bafilar artery, and entering the meatus auditorius internus. From this trunk, I conceive that mod of thefe arteries which I have defcribed, are derived. -)- In the foetus, it becomes here fuperficial, ^ This the aqueduct of Fallopius, Where

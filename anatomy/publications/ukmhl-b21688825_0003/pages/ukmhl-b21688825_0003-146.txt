They diverge from each other as they proceed forwards, and each penetrates under the anterior point of the tentorium by the fide of the caver- nous fmus, and pafles through the foramen lacerum. In the general defcription it is fufficient to fay, that they are diflributed in common to all the mufeles of the eye. THE FOURTH PAIR OF NERVES. The fourth pair of nerves, pathetici, or trochleares, are the fmalleft nerves of the encephalon, being not much larger than a fewing thread. This nerve comes out from betwixt the cerebrum and cerebellum, pafles by the fide of the pons varolii, and after a long courfe pierces the dura mater behind the clynoid procefs, runs along for fome way in a canal or {heath, formed by the dura mater ; it then pafles through the caver- nous fmus, continues its courfe onwards through the foramen lacerum to the orbit, and is finally appro- priated to the fuperior oblique mufcle of the eye. The origin of the fourth pair, if we take implicitly the defcriptions of authors, feems to have a much greater variety than any of the other nerves; fo that it is common to fay, the fourth pair of nerves arife about the region of the nates and teftes f.

-43Â° GF the human ear. the foramen rotundum, circulate round the modiolus by the fcala tympani, pafs into the leffer extremity of the fcala veftibuli in the infundibulum, and circulate through it towards the bafe of the cochlea, until it pafs into the veftibule ; or it muft pafs from the fcala veftibuli into the fcala tympani. The firft is the opi- nion of Scarpa and others. But I truft it will after- wards appear, that the ofcillations of found are in the firft place conveyed into the veftibule, and thence cir- culate round both the femicircular canals and cochlea. In the dry bones, when we cut into the cochlea, there appears a fpiral tube, as I have defcribed; with a partition running along it, and, of courfe, taking the fame fpiral turns with it towards the apex. This is the boney part of the lamina fpiralis; but, as the membrane which extends from its circular edge quite acrofs the fpiral tube of the cochlea, has fhrunk and fallen away in the dry ftate of the parts, the lamina fpiralis is like a hanging flair, and the fcalae are not divided into diftindl paffages. In this bare ftate of the fhell of the cochlea, when we cut away the cupola or apex of the cochlea, and look down upon the infun- dibulum, we fee the extreme point of the lamina fpi- ralis rifmg in an acute hook-like point. The modiolus or central pillar, and the lamina fpiralis which encircles it, are of the moft exquifite and delicate ftru&ure; for, through them the portion of the feventh nerve deftined to the cochlea is convey- ed. To fay that the modiolus is formed of two central bones, is faying that there is no central column at all; or, that the modiolus is the cavity feen in the bottom of the meatus auditorius: and to affirm, at the fame

328 ANATOMY OF THE HUMORS. * CHAP. X. SOME SURGICAL OBSERVATIONS CONNECTED WITH THE ANATOMY OF THE HUMORS. I have already mentioned, as the principle of the operation of extracting the lens, that the fimple action of the mufcles, furrounding the eye-ball, is fufficient to protrude the lens, if the incifion of the cornea be of proper dimenfions relative to the fize of the lens. No doubt, if there have been thickening inflammation and perhaps preternatural adhefions of the membranes fur- rounding the lens, the operation will neceflarily become more complicated ; the lens will not glide at once over the cheek when the incifion of the cornea is completed. But (till, I think, we are not to allow ourfelves to con- fider it as a ftep of the operation, in any circumftances, that the ball of the eye is to be prefled; becaufe, in that cafe, the membranes of the lens give way fuddenly, and part of the vitreous humor unavoidably is protruded with it, or the edge of the lens is turned obliquely to the pupil, and the vitreous humor efcapes by the fide of it. It is better to deftroy the adhefions with the inftrument, and to fcratch the capfule of the lens fo that it nlay burft. Whence it is evident that it is neceflary, in order to infure the correct performance of the ope- ration of extraction, that the lens fhould prefs equally forward on the pupil, and that the pupil Ihould be al- lowed

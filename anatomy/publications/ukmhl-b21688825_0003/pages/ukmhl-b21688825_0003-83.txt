The inferior longitudinal finus, or fimply the lefler, or inferior finus of the falx, runs in that edge of the falx which penetrates betwixt the hemifpheres of the cerebrum. It is extremely fmall towards the fore part of the falx; but, as it paffes backwards, it goes on in- creafing by the acceihon of veins which come from the hemifpheres, and'corpus callofum, and from the falx itfelf. It is formed betwixt the lamina of the falx. Sometimes it runs in its very edge, but as frequently a little way removed from it; fometimes it is found beginning very far back in the falx. The fore part of it is more like a vein running in the falx than a finus. It is in general to be feen more fuperficial, and in every refpeft like a vein, (there being no proyifion for ■* Lower conceives that the fize of the jugular foffa was the effedt of the reflux of the blood ; and that the greater fize of the finus of the right fide was to be traced to the practice of nurfes laying their children chiefly on the right fide !

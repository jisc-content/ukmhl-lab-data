3^4 OF SEEING IN GENERAL. how impoffible it is to neglect the more vivid im- preffion. From fuch a radical defeat in the vifion, as the hu- mo)s of one eye having a different focus from the other, and confequently an indiftinCtnefs of vifion pro- duced from two images of different fuzes intermingling their colours, children feem very frequently to be made to fquint; and I have known adults, with a degree of the fame inequality in the eyes, kept from fquinting only by a particular attention to the di- rection of their eyes. M. de Buffon, in his Differta- tion already quoted, after affirming what has been already delivered, viz. that no one fquints with both eyes at once, fays, he has obferved three inffances in which the eyes, according to circumftances, were alternately diltorted from the object. This he ac- counts for by finding that, with one eye, the letters of a book could be feen at the diffance of two or three feet, and not nearer than fifteen inches; while, with the other, the letters could be diftinguifhed at the diffance of from four to fifteen inches only. Confequently, when looking to diftant objeCts, the image being more diftinct with the long-fighted eye, the other was turned from the objeCt; but when objects at a fmall diffance were feen, the image in the rar-fighted eye being imperfeCt, it is turned from the axis, that it may not interfere with the ftronger image of the other eye, which is now directed to the objeCt. A frequent effeCt of the wreaknefs left by long fevers in children, is a fquint which gradually goes off as the ftrength

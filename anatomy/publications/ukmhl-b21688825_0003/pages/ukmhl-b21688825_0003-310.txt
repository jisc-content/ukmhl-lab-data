286 OF THE RETINA. retina is fuch, as neceffarily to obftruft the tranfmiffioR of the rays of light to the choroid coat. M. de la Hire took part in this controverfy. He confidered the re- tina as the organ of fight, although a particular point of it is not fufceptible of immediate impreffions from outward objects; for, fays he, we mud not conceive fenfation to be conveyed by any other means than by the nerves. But, obferving the conftitution of the other organ of the fenfes, he entertained an idea that the retina receives the impreffion in a fecondary way, and through the choroides, as an intermediate organ ; that, by the light flriking the choroid coat, it is agi- tated, and communicates the motion to the retina; and we find, that, through all the organs of the fenfes, he continues, the nerves are too delicate to be imme- diately expofed to the naked impreffions of external bodies. Another obje&ion to the opinion, that the retina is the feat of fenfation, has been lately urged, viz. that the thicknefs of this coat, together with its tranfparency, allows of no particular furface for receiving the image ; and that its tranfparency would caufe a partial difper- fion, which would produce a confufion in vifion #. If thefe opinions require ferious refutation, we have it in the effe&s of the difeafes of the retina, optic nerve, * M. Le Cat thought that the pia mater was the fentient part of the nerve. It was, therefore, a kind of confirmation of his opinion to fuppofe the choroid to be the feat of vifion, as he teaches that the choroid coat is a produdtion of the pia mater. He conceived that the retina moderated the imprefiion of light upon the choroid coat, as the cuticle dulls the imprefiion on the papilla; of the tongue. and

225 OF THE EYE.' 6f exciting the idea of whitenefs which the whole raifess White light is compofed of different kinds of rays, which individually give the fenfation : one of red, another of orange, a third of yellow, a fourth of green, a fifth of light blue, a fixth of indigo, and a feventh of a violet or purple Thefe are named the prifmatic colours ; becaufe, in the fpectrum produced by mak- ing a ray of light to pafs through a prifm, thefe feveral colours are feen in the fucceffion * in which they are above enumerated. Each of thefe rays individually impreffes the eye with its own colour ; but when they all imprefs the eye at once, the fenfation upon the organ of fight is a compound effecl: no individual colour is prefented, but that mixed light which is called whitenefs, and which may be divided into its individual colours by palling it through a prifm. It is the nature of moft bodies to abforb fome of thefe rays of light and to reflect others from their fur- face ; confequently, the colours of bodies depend upon the particular rays which are reflected from them, or upon the combination of fuch rays as are reflected from them; and a body appears of that colour of which the light coming from it is chiefly compofed. When a ray of light paffes from a rarer to a denfer medium, or from a denfer into a rarer, it alters its courfe, * There is a fa& not a little extraordinary regarding the emanation <f f rays from the fun, and which has been difcovered in the prefent day, viz. that there are invifiblerays, giving heat but no light, which arc iefs refraftabie than the coloured rays; and that all rays, in pro- portion to their refrangibility, have iefs power of producing heat. See Herfchel on the invifible rays of light. PfayG TranC 1800, pari Â«. p. 284. if

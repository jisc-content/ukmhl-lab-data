OF THE VEINS OF THE BRAIN. 51 theijifelves with the plexus. Again feveral branches of veins are extended in the poflerior part of the ven- tricle. Thefe are from the medullary fubftance of the poflerior lobe of the cerebrum. They pafs under the poflerior crus of the fornix and join the vena galeni. Laflly a vein remarkably tortuous, frequently full of blood, paffes forward and is feen at intervals in the plexus choroides. This vein taking an acute turn, joins its fellow under the anterior crura of the fornix and is reflected backwards and under the fornix, fo as to form the beginning of the vena galeni. The vena galeni then is the great central vein of the brain. It ftretches from the extremity of the fourth fmus into the- internal part of the brain, to re- ceive the blood from the membrane lining the ven- tricles,—from the fubftance of the brain,—-from the plexus choroides,—-and from the velum interpofttum*. It lies under the poflerior part of the corpus callofum, under the fornix and above the nates and teftes. It is entangled in the velum itfelf. It confifts of two great branches which lie parallel to each other, and which fometiraes have the appearance of being twifted, and thefe unite before they enter the fourth or ftraight ftnus. In the basis of the brain the veins are not re- markable nor do they require any defcription diftindt from the finufes into which they open. * The velum lying upon the nates and teftes, and adhering to them and the pineal gland, the vena galeni receives here alfo veins from thofe bodies, and from the upper part of the cere bellum.

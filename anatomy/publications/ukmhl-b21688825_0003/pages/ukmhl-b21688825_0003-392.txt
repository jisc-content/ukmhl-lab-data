OF THE EYE-LIDS. 368 cartilage having a triangular edge, and the bafe of the angle forming the flat furface of the margin of the eye-lid, they meet with the moft perfeft accuracy. Either end of this hoop-like cartilage is connected with the periofteum at the corners of the eye, fo as to move with its fellow as upon a hinge. This cartilage of the eve-lid is called tarsus. J The upper eye-lid only, is moved for the admiflion of light to the eye ; it is raifed by the levator palpebrse mufcle. But the eye-lids are fhut again by the orbi- cularis palpebrarum, which afts on both eye-lids, and fometimes with fuch power, as to fqueeze the eye-ball even to a painful degree. The meibomean olands. Thefe are very elegant little glands which lie under the inner membrane of the eye-lids. About twenty or thirty dufts of thefe glands open upon the tarfus of each eye-lid. Thefe dufts run up under the vafcular membrane of the infide of the eye-lid, and minute glandular folicules, to the amount of about tv/enty, are, as it were, attached to each of thefe dufts. Thefe glands exude a white fe- baceous matter, which defends the edge of the eye-lid from the acrid tears, and clofes them more accurately by its unftuofity. The vafcularity of the inner furface of the eye-lid is fubfervient to thefe glands; for the veflels forming their ramifications round the little glands, fecrete the febaceous matter into them. This, then, is the feat of the opthalmia tarfi ; and following this inflammation, the edges of the eye-lids, and the mouths of the dudls, are fometimes eroded with little ulcers. Thefe dufts are the feat of the ftye. This is an inflammation and doling up of the mouth of one of

68 OF THE VEINS OF THE BRAIN. charged finufes and veins of the brain into the exter- nal veins. But thofe Ieffer pafiages for the blood, fuppofing us to be affured that the blood flowed through them, from the finus to the external veins, are infignificant, when compared with the great out-let of the internal ju- gular vein; to vhich we have feen all the finufes tend. But the accumulation of blood in the veflfels of the brain is feldom mechanically produced ; it is a dif- eafe in the a&ion of/the fyftem of the brain, to which we become more and more liable as we advance in years ; it is the fame gradual change which is operating on the venous fyftem from infancy to old age, that caufes this clafs of difeafes of the brain to be peculiar to advanced life. The importance of the finufes in the circulation of the blood in the brain, is either vaguely defcribed, or imperfeftly underftood by authors. We find it faid, that the finufes fupport the blood againft compreflion, and protect its free circulation. This to me feems an erroneous idea. The lefler veins are, as in other parts of the body, and have no fuch provifion; and fince, within the head, there can be no fuch partial compref- fion as in the limbs, any caufe which would com- prefs the greater veins, were they not fupported, muft fall upon their extremities with worfe effeft. The cir- culation is the only power which can aft mechanically upon the brain; but this can never caufe a compreflion of its veins, becaufe the incfeafed aftion of the arteries muft tend more to the diftention of the veins than it will be the occafion of the brain comprefling them. i The

OF THE HUMAN EAR. 429 the This fpiral partition runs in the fpiral tube of the coch- lea, fo as to divide it in its whole length ; and, in the frelh ftate of the parts, this lamina of bone is eked out by membrane, fo as to form two perfectly diftin6t tubes. Thefe tubes are the scalar cochleae ; they run into each other at the apex of the cochlea ; but at the bafe, the one turns into the veftibule, and the other opens into the tympanum by the foramen ro- TUNDUM. In the middle of the cochlea there runs down a pillar, which is the centre of the circumvolutions of the fcalae. It is called the modiolus. This pillar is of a fpongy ftrudture ; and through it the nerves are tranfmitted to the lamina fpiralis, and Tides of the cochlea. The modiolus opens towards the apex of the cochlea like a funnel; and when we take away the outward Ihell of the apex of the cochlea, which is called the cupola, we look into this expanfion of the upper part of the modiolus as into a funnel; it is therefore called the infundibulum. The infundibulum is that part which, in a perpendicular fedtion, we ftiould call the upper partition *. The fcalse or divifions of the fpiral tube of the coch- lea, have a communication at their fmaller extremities in the infundibulum; and as, again, their larger ex- tremities do not open into the fame cavity, but one into the veftibule, and the other into the tympanum, the vibrating motion, which is communicated through the cochlea, muft pafs either from the tympanum into f That is fuppofmg the cochlea to reft on its bafe.

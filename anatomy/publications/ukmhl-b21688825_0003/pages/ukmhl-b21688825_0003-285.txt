OF THE COATS OF THE EYE. 26l In regard to the names appropriated to this part of the eye, there is more confufion than it is poffible to believe. It is neceffary to attend to this ambiguous ufe of terms, elfe we fnall be in danger of mifunder- ftanding our bed authors. Vefalius confiders the whole as a feptum betwixt the vitreous and pofterior chamber o'f the aqueous humor; but he feems to find much difficulty in giving it an appropriate name *. Fallopius and Morgagni f ufe the term corpus ciliare for the whole circle of the proceffes, and in the fame fenfe that I have ventured to ufe corona ciliaris. It is a name which conveys the idea neither of the fhape nor of the fubftance of the thing meant. Ruyfch makes great confufion by his ufe of terms ; the corona ciliaris, or ciliary body, he calls the ligamentum ciliare ; and the lines on the back furface of the iris, he calls pro- ceffus ciliaris mufculofus; or, rather, he means by this, the ftraight fibres of the iris J. Duverney, with Ruyfch and Window, following Fallopius, calls the corona ciliaris alfo ligamentum ciliare. But the ciliary li- * “ Neque mihi ullum occurrit nomen quod ipfi aptius indam “ quam tunica : aut ft voles, interftitii vel fcpti inter yvitreum r‘ humorem & earn quern albugineum nuncubamus repoi’ui." Vefal. vol. i. p. 558. •f- Epift. Anat. xvii. 11. J Ruyfch has this expreflion ; l< Ligamentum ciliare neutiquam efle confiderandum tanquam mufculum ad pupillae et humoris criftal- lini motum deftinatum, totumque hoc negotium perfici a proceffu ciliari ut et a circulo mufculari pofterius in confinio pupillae fito.” Thes. Anat. ii. xv. See alfo the explanation of fig. iv. of this The- faurus, where we have “ Iiis enim eft facies exterior, proceffus lig. ciliaris facies interior. Vol. III. T gament

23 OF THE MEMBRANES OF THE BRAIN. and connefts itfelf with thefubftance of the brain; and although delicate, it forms the fupport and ftrength of its ceneritious and medullary fubftance. All vef- fels diftributed in the body, however minute, are al- ways conveyed in membranes; the pia mater then follows, or rather conveys the veffels not only into the cavities of the brain, but to every part of its fubftance, it being intimately blended with it *. We fee it more diftin&ly defcending in ftrong plicae into the interftices of the convolutions; nor is it into them only that it enters, but into every pore which conveys a veflelf. The pia mater as it paffes into the fubftance of the brain, divides and fubdivides into partitions and cells, and every capillary veffel, and every molicule of the fubftance of the brain is inverted and fupported by its fubdivifions. The pia mater is to the brain what the cellular membrane is to the other vifcera and parts of the body ; for it is the peculiar matter lying in the interftitious cellular membrane (as in mufcles, bones, &c.) that gives the peculiarity of character to the parts J ; the * Columbus, the afiiftant of Veflalius, and afterwards Profeffor in Rome, explained this intimate iptertexture of the pia mater with the proper fubftance of the brain, fo far back as* 1559. f When we tear off the pia mater from the brain (for it cannot be called diffeftion), it does not adhere merely at the fulci, but to the whole furface of the convolutions ; and every where fmall veffels en- ter, and with thefe veffels defcends alfo the lamina of the pia mater. f “ Sed cum continuo triduo in inquifttione facienda perfeveraf- “ fern; tandem deprehendi cerebri fibrillas eadem ratione, continu- “ ataque ferie, ftbi invicem annexas effe; quemadmodum fibrillas “ carneas tendinibus adhaerere demonftravi; cum igitur illam cerebri “ cum vafis fanguineis connexionem deprehendiffem ; et earn, quam “ ante dixi, variorum fru&uum compagem attenderem; iterum con- C 4 ‘‘ clufi

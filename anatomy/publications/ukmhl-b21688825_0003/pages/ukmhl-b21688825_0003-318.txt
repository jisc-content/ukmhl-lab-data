GF THE RETINA. 294 From thefe experiments, we may conclude, that fpots which feem to move before the eyes are not, on that account, folely to be attributed to opacity of the humors or cornea, fince the appearance of motion may be given to thofe motes, though occafioned by an af- fection of the nerve ; efpecially, if the unufual fenfa- tion be attended with giddinefs. Giddinefs, however, is not neceffary to fuch fenfation; when my eyes are fatigued, and, fitting in my room, I look towards the window, I fee before me fmall lucid circles which feem to defcend in quick fucceffion ; upon attending more particularly to my eyes, I find them in perpetual mo- tion ; my eye is turned gradually downward, which gives to the fpeCtrum the appearance of defcending; but it regains its former elevation with a quick and imperceptible motion.

54 OF THE MEMBRANES OF THE BRAIN. the cellular membrane itfelf is nearly alike in all; there- fore, in my judgment, the pia mater is rightly con- fidered by fome anatomifts as a cellular fubltance * *. Malacarne fays, I am much inclined to confider it with the illuft. Haller as being compofed of lamina, like common adipofe membrane, and that the ex- treme arteries ramify through its cells, for, with a blow- pipe, we can raife it into cells like the common mem- brane ; and if this be carefully done, the air may be made to pafs from cell to cell, following the arteries in their courfe betwixt the lobuli, and in the fubltance of the brain f. We can follow the pia mater into the ventricles, by tracing it betwixt the polterior lobe of the cerebrum and the cerebellum, where it forms the ve- lum interpofitum of Haller, and paffes under the fornix. We can follow it alfo into the polterior horn of the lateral ventricles from the bafe of the brain, where t he branches of the middle artery of the cerebrum pafs into the lower part of the choroid plexus ; we trace it alfo into the bottom' of the fourth ventricle. The pia mater lining the ventricles is more delicate, and lefs ef clufi dominum, univer.fi conditorem, in rerum creatarum fabrica “ eafdem vei confimiles fere leges tenuiffe.”^-“ Igitur adyerti fibrillas “ certo loco fibi conjunftas, mox alio loco ab invicem divertere, paulo paft iterum coeuntes.

OF THE VEINS OF THE BRAIN. 6 2 wing of Ingraflias, and before the great wing of the fphenoid bone; they receive the blood in part from the orbit, and from the dura mater; they open into the cavernous finus, or perhaps into the opthalmic finus, which of courfe, for the moil part, conveys the blood into the fuperior or inferior longitudinal finus. The inferior sphenoidal sinus is very irregular and inconftant. It is in the dura mater, covering the great wing of the fphenoidal bone : the blood of this finus is emptied into the cavernous finus, or efcapes by emeiTarii into the trunk of the temporal veins. The anterior clynoid sinus.—The pofterior clynoid finus, cr eliptic finus, and the circular finus, are one and the fame ; the difference confifts only in the manner of defcribing them ; the circular sinus lies within the clynoid proceffes of the fphenoid bone, and furrounds the glandula pituitaria As this circular finus opens upon each fide into the cavernous fmus, it is not unaptly divided into two ; the anterior half of the circle, being the anterior * Ridley defcribes it in thefe words : “ Another I difcovered by “ having injected the veins with wax, running round the pituitary “ gland on its upper fide, forewardly within a duplicature of the “ dura mater, backwardly between the dura mater and pia mater, “ there fomewhat loofely ftretched over the fubjacent gland itfe.lf, “ and laterally in a fort of canal made up of the dura mater above, C£ and the carotid artery on each outfide of the gland, which, by “ being fallened to the dura mater, above and below, at the bafis of “ the fcull, leaves only a little interllice betwixt itfelf and the gland.” (Accuratius tamena Rilleyo deferiptus eft.

247 OF THE COATS OF THE EYE. The fclerotic coat is the great fupport of the glo- bular figure of the eye ; it defends the more delicate internal ftm&ure from {lighter injuries, by its ftrength ; tl'nd from the progrefs of inflammation, by being of a ftru&ure but little vafcular, and not prone to difeafe. That inflammation which we fee to be fo frequent in the eye, is not in the fclerotica, but in the adventitious coat, the conjundiva. But in proportion as the fcle- rotic coat refifts preflure and the progrefs of difeafe from without, it refifts the fwelling of the parts within when they become difeafed, and gives the greateft. torture. Of what importance the entirenefs of the coats, and the uniform refiftance of the humors of the eye is to the healthy ftate of the organ, will be afterwards exa- mined* * OF THE CORNEA. The cornea is fo called, from being firm, tranfpa- rent, and compofed of laminae *. It is the pellucid dura mater of the nerve is expanded into the cornea (viz. fclerotica). The fecond envelope, or pia mater, forms two laminae; the one is applied to the fclerotic coat, and the other forms the choroid coat. The choroid coat divides anteriorly, and forms the iris and ciliary precedes. The internal medullary part of the optic nerve forms the retina.

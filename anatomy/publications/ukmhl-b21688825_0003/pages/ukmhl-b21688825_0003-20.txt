INTRODUCTORY VIEW* 2 The fubflance of the brain is delicate and foft, ancl poffeffes a degree of elaflic refiftance; but the nerves are firm, hard, and devoid of elafticity; becaufe, though their peculiar fubflance has equal delicacy with the brain, their membranes give them firmnefs and flrength to enable them to pafs through the moving parts of the body without being bruifed, or having their function xaffe£ted. The fubflance of the brain is prote&ed and fupported by the foull and dura mater: its peculiar matter is fupported and nourifhed by the pia mater. The nerves contain the fame matter with the brain 5 but in their courfe through the body this matter is dif- guifed by the peculiar flruclure of their membranes, which, while they fupport their fubflance, nourifh them alfo, as the membranes do the brain. But the extre- mities of the nerves are again reduced to the fame deli- cate texture with the brain. In the rtrutlure of the brain and nerves there is an analogy with the other parts of the body. In a bone or a mufcle there is the fame intexture of membranes Supporting the peculiar fubflance which is the cha- radteriftic of the part, and conveying blood veffels for its nourifhment. The mufcular fibres, or the earth of bone, are, in the midft of this inverting membrane, pe- culiar parts diflinel in their properties, as the medullary fubflance of the nerves is amidft the cellular membrane, •which divides them into fafciculi, and gives them their fibrous appearance. . When it is faid that the nerves are produdlions of the brain, we are not to underhand that they are pro- pagated from it to the diftant parts of the body, as if drawn out from it like a thread from the wool.

In serpents, the mechanifm external to the feat of the organ is lefs complete than in the frog. From the fcales behind the articulation of the bone which keeps the lower jaw extended, a little column of bone f flretches inward and forward. This bone has its inner extremity enlarged to an oval figure, and is in- ferted into the foramen ovale. This creature has no membrana tympani, nor does it appear to have fo good a fubftitute as the frog: the outer extremity of the bone feems rather attached to the lower jaw by a car- tilaginous appendage and fmall ligament J. Within the fcull, ferpents have the little fac, with the cretaceous matter and femicircular canals, united by a common belly ยง. In the turtle, we find a proper tympanum, and by lifting the fcaly integuments from the fide of the head a little above the articulation of the lower jaw, we open this cavity. Through this cavity there ex- tends a very long and flender bone, which, upon the outer extremity, is attached by a little elaftic brufh of fibres to the cartilaginous plate under the integuments, while the inner extremity is enlarged, fo as to apply accurately to the foramen, which opens into the vefti- * See fig. 6. d. f Plate, fig. 7.

In molt men, the motion of the ear is loft, but fome <nen ftill retain it; and this is very remarkable, that when the more internal mechanifm of the ear is injured, and ceafes to ftrengthen the found before it conveys it inwards to the labyrinth, the external car refumes the office to which it was originally adapted, and by a de- gree of motion and ereCtion, affifts the hearing. In Europeans, the outward ear is in a great degree flattened to the head by the drefs; but in Eaftern nations, and in ancient ftatues, we fee the ears ft and prominent, and bear a part in the fymmetry and expreffion of the whole head. The mufcles moving the cartilages, befides, being intended to give motion, appear to have a more eflential ufe in giving a due tenfion to the outward ear. Thefe cartilages are furrounded with their peculiar pericondrium; but as to their veflels and nerves, it feems very fuperfluous to give a minute defcription of them here. When the cartilages are difle&cd, they appear thus; Fig 18 a. The

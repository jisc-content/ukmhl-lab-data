352 OF SEEING IN GENERAL. fhould be accurately in the middle of the eye-ball in order to produce fingle vifion. By voluntary fquinting or depreffing one of the eyes with the finger, objects appear double, becaufe the optic axis is changed in the diflorted or depreffed eye, and the picture is no longer painted on, corre- fponding points of both. This fimple experiment leads us to confider what is the conflitution and correfpond- once of the eyes, that, when each has the pi&ure of the objedt impreffed upon it, we fhould only fee it fmgle if the eyes are found and perfect. For example, the obje& a, in fig. 16., is exactly in the centre of the axis of both eyes, confequently, it is di- ftinctly feen: and it appears fingle, becaufe the rays from it ftrike upon the points of the retina oppofite to the pupils in both eyes. Thofe points have a cor- refpondence ; and the objedt, inftead of appearing double, is only flrengthened, in the livelinefs of the image.

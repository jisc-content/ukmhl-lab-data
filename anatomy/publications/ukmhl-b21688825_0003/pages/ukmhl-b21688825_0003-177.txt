OF THE PARTICULAR NERVES. I5X L 4 clafs the angle of the jaw, and is dillributed to thofe fibres of the platyfma myoides which flretch up upon the face, and form the riforius fantorini: it pafles on to the angle of the lips, and is dillributed to their deprelfor mufcle. Betwixt thofe facial nerves there are frequent communications, while they are at the fame time united .with the extremities of feveral branches of the fifth pair. 3. The descending branches pafs along the mar- gine of the jaw, down upon the neck, and backward upon the occiput. Thus we fee that the commu- nicating nerve of the face is well named.â€”It is dillri- buted to the fide of the face, head, and upper part of the neck: it unites its extreme branches with thofe of the three great divifions of the fifth pair, with the eighth and ninth, with the acceffory of the eighth pair, with the fecond and third cervical nerves, and with the fympathetic. From thofe various connections it has been called the Idler fympathetic. As to the fympathies which phyficians have thought fit to afcribe to the con- nexions of this with other nerves, as laughing, weeping, killing, &c. they would be tedious to enumerate, and by no means inltruCtive. The portio mollis of the feventh pair of nerves is the acaullic or auditory nerve ; which lhall be confi- dered in a more diltinCt and particular manner, when we defcribe the other parts of the organ of hearing. The nerves which we have now defcribed are con- nected with the anatomy of the head, and circulate chiefly around the bones of the face. Thofe we are next to confider extend their branches to the neck, and form there a very intricate piece of anatomy, while a

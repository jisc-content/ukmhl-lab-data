OF THE EARS OF ANIMALS. 383 Yet the cartilaginous fifhes, which arefuppofed to have an external ear, fwim in the fame element, and are in no effential point peculiar in their habits. And we fhould receive with caution the account of any pecu- -liarity in the organ of hearing of one clafs of fifhes, which is not common to all inhabiting the fame fluid. Such animals as occafionally pafs from the water into the air, mull have a membrane capable of vibrating in the air; but, even in them, it is expanded under the common integuments, and protected by them. Were it otherwife, when the creature plunged into the water, it would be aflailed with that noife, (confounding all regular founds), of which man is fenfible when he plunges under water. It appears oppofite to the gene- ral law of nature, to fuppofe any fpecies of fifh having that Ample and more delicate membrane, which is evidently intended to convey atmofpheric founds only, while, on the other hand, creatures living in the water alone, fhould have an organization fit to endure the flronger vibrations of their denfer fluid, and which would be ufelefs and abfurd in thofe exifling in our atmofphere. When we come to examine the ear of the fkate, we find, that what Dr. Monro conceives to be the outward ear of the fifh*, is really, as reprefented by * “ In the upper and back part of the head of a fkate, and in a “ large fifh weighing 150 pounds, at the diftance nearly of one inch “ from the articulation of the head, with the fir ft vertebra of the “ neck or atlas, two orifices, capable of admitting fmall fized ftock- “ jpg wires at the diftance of about an inch and a quarter from each “ other,

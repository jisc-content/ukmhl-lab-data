OF THE VENTRICLES OF THE BRAIN. 91 lateral ventricle, is the tenia semicircularis gemi- num, which we fhall prefently more particularly de« fcribe. To underhand the further connections and import- ance of the optic thalami we mud: dilfeCt the bafe of the brain. There we find that it is through the corpora ftriata, and the thalami nervorum opticorum, that the crura cerebri eftablilh their extenfive connexion with the internal mafs of the brain > particularly we find that the crura (hoot up into the back and lower part of the thalami. Here on the lower part alfo we may obferve the tractus opticus, which we may trace backwards from the optic nerves. They furround the crura ce- rebri with a femicircular fweep, dwelling out at the fame time, and terminating in three confiderable tube- rofities: they are finally confounded with the lower part of the optic thalami * ; at the fame time there runs up a divifion of it into the nates. The tenia semicircularis geminum is the trad of the medullary matter, which is betwixt the two great anterior tubercles of the lateral ventricle, the corpus ftriatum and thalamus nervi optici. Towards the fore part of this traft its furface is covered with a layer of a femi- tranfparent greyifh matter, through which we fee the * Willis feeing the firft ana fecond pair of nerves fo clofely con- nected with thefe tubercles, and fuppofmg, as we have mentioned in a former note, that the corpora itriata were the common fenfo- rium, concludes, “ hinc ratio patet, cur odores fine olfaftus objeCt^ “ ipfum adeo cerebrum feriunt, et immediate afhciunt; item cur “ inter vifionem et imaginationem communicatio citiffima habe- “ tur.” T. 44. * veins

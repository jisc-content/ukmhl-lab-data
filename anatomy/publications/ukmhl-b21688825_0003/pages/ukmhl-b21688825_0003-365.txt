DISTANCE OF OBJECTS. 34-i The fibrous ftructure and mufcularity of the lens Was brought forward by Defcartes, as explaining fome actions of the eye ; but was again neglected, till more lately, that it has been revived by the infertion of Mr. Young’s obfervations on vifion in the Philofophical Tranfadtions *. The following are Mr. Young’s ob- fervations on the appearance of the lens:—44 The crif- “ talline lens of the ox is an orbicular convex tranf- 44 parent body, compofed of a confiderable number 44 of fimilar coats, of which, the exterior clofely adhere 44 to the interior.. Each of thefe coats confilts of fix 44 mufcles, intermixed with a gelatinous fubltance, 44 and attached to fix membranous tendons. Three 44 of the tendons are anterior, three polterior; their 44 length is about two thirds of the femidiameter of 64 the coat; their arrangement is that of three equal 44 and equidiftant rays, meeting in the axis of the crif- u talline ; one of the anterior is directed towards the 154 outer angle of the eye, and one of the polterior to- 44 wards the inner angle, fo that the polterior are 44 placed oppofite to the middle of the interllices of 44 the anterior ; and planes palling through each of 44 the fix, and through the axis, would mark on either 54 furface fix regular equidiftant rays. The mufcular 44 fibres arife from both tides of each tendon; they 44 diverge till they reach the greatelt circumference cf 44 the coat, and having palled it, they again converge 44 till they are attached refpeftively to the tides of the 44 nearelt tendons of the oppofite furface.

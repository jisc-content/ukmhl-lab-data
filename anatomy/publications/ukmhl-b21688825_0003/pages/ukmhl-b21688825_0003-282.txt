258 OF'THE COATS OF THE EtE. to them the appearance of the regular plicae of the choroid coat, converging to the edge of the lens, and forming altogether a difk round it. When the black paint on the ciliary proceffes is a little walhed away, and when we attentively examine this part, we find the ciliary proceffes..to be actually little oblong plica;, which gradually arife from the cho- roid coat at the angle of its inflexion, and terminate abruptly, approximating, but not attached,to the margin of the lens. When the paint is walhed entirely away, the whole circle of thefe proceffes appears evidently to be the continued choroid coat. When not injected, the ciliary proceffes are pale and loofe ; but when minutely injected, they take a perfect icarlet colour : they refemble, in their uninje&ed date, the valvular-like doublings of the vilous coat of the ftomach and inteftines. Before the choroid coat is in- dexed towards the lens, in the form of 'ciliary pro- ceffes, it forms a firm adhefion to the fclerotic coat near the circular margin of the cornea, and at the fame time is united firmly to the root of the iris. From this, the proceffes tend inward, and a little backwards ; and are, at their internal extremities, detached from the iris; nor are they attached to the margin of the lens, but are loofe and floating. When the vitrious humor and lens fall out from the anterior fegment of the eye, we find that the plicae or cili- ary proceffes have left their impreflion on the anterior furface of the vitreous humor, and alfo on the inter- mediate expanfion.of the retina which extends before the membrane of the vitreous humor. This circular impreffion of the ciliary proceffes is called by Haller, ffrise

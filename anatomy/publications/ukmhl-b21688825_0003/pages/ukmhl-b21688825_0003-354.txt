33° ANATOMY OF THE HUMORS. Now that we know the place of the catarafl, and know alfo that it is the opaque lens, we can be at no lofs to introduce the needle corre£tly. If, fays M. Petit, we pierce the fclerotic coat one line from the edge of the cornea, we pierce the tunica conjunctiva, fclerotica, cho- roid, vitreous humor, and ciliary proc.efTes before the needle enters the cataract. In this puncture, we wound the molt vafcular part, and, indeed, every delicate part of the eye; for even in this moil anterior courfe, the retina is equally lacerated with the others % But if we pierce the fclerotic coat, three lines from the edge of the cornea, we avoid the ciliary ligament and body, and procefles; and, by directing it a little forward, in a line towards the oppofite margin of the iris, we lhall find the point of the needle advancing through the opaque lens; for, although the lens be fo far opaque as to prevent the light from linking the retina, it is fo far tranfparent, in general, that the needle is diftinctly feen entering its fubltance, and can be then directed, fo as to transfix the cataradl without hurting the iris. We have feen that there is no pollerior chamber of the aqueous humor fit to contain the deprelfed criltal- line lens. The belief, which even fome modern fur- geons have entertained, of the poffibility of depreffing the lens into the aqueous humor, is a remnant of thofe inaccurate notions refpecting the fize of the pollerior chamber of the aqueous humor and the place of the lens, * In our moft modern fyftem of lui-gery, we are directed to enter tlie needle one tenth of an inch. To my certain knowledge, not only the ciliary body has been injured by this direction, but even the root of the iris has been feen to be pulhcd forward on the point of the needle. which

OF THE particular nerves. 147 is not owing to fuch a junction; but that, on the contrary, the nerve naturally fwells out when it enters the finus, not from being foaked in the blood of the finus, but from its having additional inverting coats, or from the coats being ftrengthened in order to prepare the nerve for its paflage through the blood of the finus. Again, that the fympathetic nerve fends up thofe branches to join the fixth, has been prefumed from the effedls of experiments on animals, of cutting or of bruifmg the fympathetic nerve. But I fhould not be apt to give implicit credit to the refult of thefe experi- ments. Suppofmg that the fympathetic in the neck gave an origin to the fixth pair, fhould not paralyfis of the abdudtor mufcle of the eye, and in confequence of this, the turning of the eye towards the nofe, be the effect of cutting the fympathetic ? We fhall probably ceafe to difpute this point, when we confider the relations and ufe of the fympathetic nerve. The nerves cannot be confidered in any other light than as being formed of the fame matter with the brain, as having fimilar functions and powers, rather co-exift- ing than dependant on the brain: and the fympathetic nerve may be defined, a tradt of medullary matter, parting through and connecting the head and neck, the vifcera of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis, into one whole. The fympathetic nerve is fmgular in this, that it takes no particular origin, but has innumerable ori- gins, and a univerfal connection with the other nerves through all the trunk of the body. Thofe vifcera to which it is dirtributed are entirely independent of the L 2 will.

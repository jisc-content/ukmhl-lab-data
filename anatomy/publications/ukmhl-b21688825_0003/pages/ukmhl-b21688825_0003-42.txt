22 OF THE MEMBRANES OF THE BRAIN. this covers the furface uniformly, without palling into the interftices of the convolutions, or into the ventri- cles *. This membrane is fo extremely thin, that it cannot by diffe&ion be feparated for any confiderable fpace from the pia mater, and leaft of all, over the middle hemifpheres of the brain. By the blow-pipe, indeed, we may raife it into cells, but it immediately fubfides again; on the polterior part of the cerebellum, on the fpinal marrow and bafe of the brain, it is more eafily raifed and demonlfrated f. It does not pafs deep into the fulci of the brain, but unites them by an extremely deli- cate cellular texture. The view which would incline me to confider the tu- nica arachnoides merely as a layer of the pia mater is this: when the vafcular pia mater defcends into the fulci, the tunica arachnoides does not follow it, but keeps to the uniform furface of the brain; but when this vafcular membrane is about to'enter into forne of the lefTer fulci which afe within the larger, it again parts with another lamella, while its more vafcular part defcends Hill deeper into the brain. OF THE PROPER PIA MATER, OR TUNICA VASCULOSA. The pia mater is a fimple membrane, without either tendinous aponeurotic or mufcular fibres. It is extremely vafcular, but it is tranfparent in the interftices of its veffels: it is the membrane which immediately inverts * Haller Elemen. Fhyf. tom. iv. fee. viii. p. 7. -j- F.

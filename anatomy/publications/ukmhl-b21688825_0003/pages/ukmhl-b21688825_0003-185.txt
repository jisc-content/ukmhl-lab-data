OF THE PARTICULAR NERVES. 159 to the lefler omentum ; at the fame time it unites with the left hepatic plexus, fome of its branches terminate in the folar plexus, which furrounds the root of the cseliac artery. The poflerior asfophageal plexus, likewife uniting again into a confiderable cord when it has come into the abdomen, fends branches to encircle the cardiac orifice of the flomach ; it branches alfo to the inferior fide and great arch of the flomach; it fends alfo branches to the fplenic plexus and folar ganglion. Thus we fee that the par vagum has a mofl appropriate name, and that it is nearly as extenhve in its connec- tions as the fympathetic itfelf. It is diflributed “ to the aefophagus, pharynx, and larynx; to the thyroid gland, veffels of the neck and heart, to the lungs, liver and fpleen, flomach, duodenum, and fometimes to the diaphragm.” The recollection of this diflribution will explain to us many fympathies; for example, the hyflerical affeftion of the throat when the flomach is diflended with flatus, the exciting of vomiting by tick- ling the throat, the effeCl which vomiting has in di- minifhing the fenfe of fuffocation, that flate of the flomach which is found upon diffeclion to accompany hydrophobia, whether fpontaneous, or from the bite of a dog. Of the accessory nerve, or third division of THE EIGHTH PAIR OF NERVES. The fpinal acceffory nerve of Willis, is that which, taking its origins like the cervical nerves from the fpinal marrow, afcends through the fpine and foramen magnum of the occipital bone, and paffes again from the fcull like one of the nerves of the brain. It paffes out with the par vagum, is attached to it in its paffage, but again feparates 7 from

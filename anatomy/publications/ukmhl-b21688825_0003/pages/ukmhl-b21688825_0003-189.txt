OF THE PARTICULAR NERVES. 163 of faliva. In a Ihort time he intirely loft the power of articulating, but retained acutely the fenfe of tafte *. From the extenfive connection of this nerve, parti- cularly with the eighth and fympathetic nerves, we fee why tremors of the tongue and aphonia may be occa- fioned by hyfteria, hypochondriafis, colics, or worms in the inteftines f. OF THE CERVICAL NERVES. First cervical nerve. Tenth pair of the scull. Subqccipital nerve. This is the leaft of all the nerves of the fpine ; it arifes by two roots from the medulla fpinalis. Some difference has been ob- ferved in the manner in which thofe roots colleCt their filaments; and only the anterior root or fafciculus is defcribed by fome authors. The pofterior fafciculus is indeed the larger, and comes in a direction different from the general direction of the roots of the other cervical nerves. The roots of the fuboccipital nerve are connected with the fpinal acceffory nerve, but feldom form a ganglion with it; and frequently they form a union with the pofterior roots of the fecond cervical nerve. The fibres of the fuboccipital nerve palling tranfverfely and a little pbliquely upwards, go out under the vertebral artery, and betwixt it and the firft vertebra of the neck. The little trunk of the fuboccipital nerve, thus formed, and having efcaped from the fpine, rifes for a little way upwards, fwells * Tabulte Neurologies, Audtore Anton. Scarpa, f J. F.Will.

y/1 OF THE SECRETION OF TEARS. inufcle over the fac is of a nature to accelerate the paflage of the tears, and even perfectly to comprefs the fac. The lachrymal fac and dud are very fre- quently difeafed and obflruded. For example, after fmall-pox, fiphylis, or in fcrophulous conftitutions, the inner membrane of the fac being of the nature of the pituitary membrane of the nofe, inflames, fwells, and adheres. The confequences of this are, firlf, a fwelling of the lachrymal fac in the inner angle of the eye, and a watery or weeping eye; upon prefling the tumor, the tears, mixed with mucus, are forced back through the puncta; by and bye the fac inflames and fuppurates; matter is difcharged by prefiure of the fac : and, laftly, it is eroded and burlts out, difcharging the tears and matter on the cheek. This is the com- plete charader of the fiftula lachrymalis. While the fac burfls outwardly, it often does further mifchief within, by making carious the thin lamina of bone in which it lies. The theory of the ancients, with re- gard to this difeafe, was that the difeafe was proceeding from the caries of the os unguis, and they perforated with the adual cautery, until the patient fmelt it in the nofe! as much with the intention of remedying the caries, as to give paflage to the tears. But it is not the bone which is the obftrudion to the perfed cure of this difeafe by operation, but the membranes, which clofe again after the moll ingenious attempts to preferve the paflage. The vis medicatrix, in this inftance, feems not to be fo well aware of her intereft as fome phyfio- logifts would inculcate. She is, here, ever at variance, with the artifice of the furgeon.

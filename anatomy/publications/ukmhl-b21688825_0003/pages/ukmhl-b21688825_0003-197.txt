OF THE PARTICULAR NERVES. 17I the anterior foramina, come into the pelvis. The pof- terior branches are very fmall, and pafs to the muf- cles fupporting the fpine; while the anterior ones are particularly large, efpecially the firft and fecond, which, with the lowed; of the loins, go to form the largefl nerve of the body, the ifchiatic nerve. . It is difficult to recollect the diftribution of the fe- veral branches of the lumbar and facral nerves, when taken thus together ; but when we deliver the defcrip- tion of the nerves of the thigh and leg, we count them, and hold them in remembrance with compara- tive eafe. At prefent we are belt prepared to follow the fympathetic nerve in its courfe. OF THE GREAT SYMPATHETIC NERVE, OR INTER- COSTAL NERVE. Notwithstanding the idea of this nerve which I have endeavoured to convey, I conceive that we mull dill continue to fpeak of the origines of this nerve in the ufual way, for the fake of fimplicity and arrange- ment. The fympathetic nerve is in general confidered as originally derived from the fixth pair ; or, we may fay, it takes its origine from the fixth, where it paffes by the fide of the carotid artery, and from the vidian branch of the fifth pair. It appears without the fcull, fometimes behind and fometimes before the carotid artery, and fometimes it is double in its exit from the bafe of the fcull. Almofl immediately after it has efcaped from the fcull, it forms its firft ganglion; which is very large and remarkable, and has the name of the superior, cervical ganglion of the fympathetic nerve.

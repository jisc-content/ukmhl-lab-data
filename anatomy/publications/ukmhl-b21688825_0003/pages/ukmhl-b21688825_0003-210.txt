184 OF THE PARTICULAR NERVES* •f form connexions with the facral nerves fimilar to thofe with the dorfal nerves.—As they defcend, they of courfe approach, and finally unite in an acute point on the os coxigis.—At the points of union of thefe extreme branches of the fympathetic nerves with the branches of the facral nerves, finall ganglions are form* ed; and there pafs out branches from them, which cover the intermediate furface of the facrum with an extenfive plexus. The ultimate ganglion, formed by the union of the two fympathetic nerves* is the coxygeal ganglion, and from it there pafs three or four nerves to the extremity of the reXum. HYPOGASTRIC PLEXUS. This is a plexus which lies on the fide of the pel- vis, and involves the hypogaftric artery. It confifts of the nerves palling to the parts contained in the pel- vis ; which do not, however, pafs in diftinX branches, but, like thofe of the abdomen, are formed into mi- nute interwoven net-Work. The hypogaftric plexus takes no determinate origine, but is continuous with, or formed by, the extreme branches of the fympathetic nerves, the extremity of the fpermatic plexus, the fa- cral nerves, (and particularly the third facral nerve,) and by the branches of the accelfory ganglions on the facrum. OF THE PHRENIC NERVE. The phrenic or diaphragmatic nerve arifes from the ceivical nerves, pafies obliquely down the neck, enters the thorax, and is diftributed to the diaphragm.— This nerve has much variety in its derivation. It comes chiefly

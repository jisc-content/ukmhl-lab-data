OF THE pellucid membrane. 325 cefsful inje&ion, we fee veffels, which all proceed from the centre of the optic nerve, palling through the vi* treous humor to the back of the capfule of the lens, viz. the branches of the arteria centralis retinae. This artery divides very often into many branches before it arrives at the capfule of the lens: now, if thefe be filled with blood, or but partially injedted, they have the ap- pearance of being branches dillributed to the vitreous humor, and not to the lens. This appearance is Hill more apt to deceive us when the lens is feparated from the vitreous humor, and when the vitreous humor is otherwife difturbed, for then the veffels Ihrink and feem to terminate in the midft of the vitreous humor. When the injection is perfect there is no fuch appearance. On the back of the lens we fee a profufion of veffels 5 but I think I may pofitively fay that thefe veffels do not penetrate to the lens itfelf, but are merely on the cap- fule, and that having made the circuit of the lens, they terminate in the membrana pupillaris and ciliary body* I can obferve no villi on the inner furface of the capfule of the lens, nor any appearance of its being a fecreting furface, to lead me to fuppofe that thefe veffels fecrete the lens, as Walter fuppofes they do ; nor, after the molt fuccefsful injedtion of the capfule of the lens and of the coats of the eye in general, can I obferve the flighted ftain of colour in the pellucid date of the lens, nor betwixt its white fibres when it becomes opaque. Nor have I obferved, at any time, a fmgle branch of thefe veffels, which are fo profufe on the back of the lens, diflributed to the anterior part of the capfule; on. the contrary, they all terminate abruptly at that line, a Vol. III.

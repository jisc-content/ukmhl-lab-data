OF SEEING IN GENERAL. 363 glafs fhould be applied to the weak eye and a convex one to the ffrong eye, fo as to reduce the laid to a ftate lefs capable of acting independently of the other. But what is called a weaknefs, is very frequently, I am convinced, merely a fhort-fightednefs in one eye: what the effect of this fhould be we may experience if we look to an object with both eyes, but with one of them through a concave or convex glafs; if we are looking upon a book, there will be produced a con- fufion of the letters, but, by a little practice, the letters will become again diftinft. By an attentive obfervation, we fhall find that this is the confequence of attending folely to the impreflion received in the naked eye : nay, what is Hill more ftrange, we can attend, in this experi- ment, to the impreflion upon the point of the axis of one eye, and to the general impreflion of both. If, while looking upon the letters of a large page, I move the convex glafs of a finall degree of power fide way before my right eye, the whole letters of the page feem to move, leaving diftinct and ftationary a circular fpot containing a word or two. Here, by no effort, while I look with both eyes, can I lofe the Heady and diffindt light of thefe few words, becaufe their image is received upon the more fenfible central point of the retina of my left eye: but all the other part of the fphere of vifion I can fee alternately, dimmed or diftindt, as I choofe to attend to the lefs powerful impreflion of the right eye, or the natural fenfation of the left. We fee, by this experiment, how eafy it is to neglect the im- preflion of one eye, if it be no ftronger than that of the - Other (and of courfe more eafily if it be weaker), and B b 4 how

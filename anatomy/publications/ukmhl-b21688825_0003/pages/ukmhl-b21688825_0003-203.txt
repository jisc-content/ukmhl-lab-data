177 OF THE PARTICULAR NERVES. £o the cervical nerves which go to the brachial plexus, and it receives branches from them *, Branches alfp pafs from this ganglion to the par vagum and recur* rent, and alfo pafs on to the cardiac and pulmonic plexus. That nerve, which mufl be confidered as the continued fympathetic, throws a ring round the root of-the vertebral artery, and fending out branches upon the fubclavian, terminates in the firfl dorfal or thoracic ganglion. THE SUPERIOR THORACIC GANGJLION. This ganglion furpafles the other thoracic ganglions in fize. It is, indeed, frequently compofed of many branches of the nerve in the neck, coming both before and behind the fubclavian artery. It receives alfo nerves from the three or four loweft cervical nerves, and firfl: dorfal nerve. It is of a very irregular figure, or rather it varies exceedingly in its fhape; fo that by various anatomifls it is defcribed as round, oval, trian- gular, quadrangular, cylindrical b—Filaments proceed from this ganglion into the canal of the vertebral ar- tery, and to the cellular coat of the fubclavian artery, and to the cardiac plexus, and alfo to the pulmonic plexus or to fupply the poflerior furface of the lungs. SYMPATHETIC NERVE IN THE THORAX. The fympathetic nerve, (as we have explained in de- \ * And even it receives fometimes from the fifth and fixth, more rarely the feventh and eighth, from the firft and fecond of the back ; and Iaftly, from the phrenic nerve.—Sometimes thefe connections are wanting.

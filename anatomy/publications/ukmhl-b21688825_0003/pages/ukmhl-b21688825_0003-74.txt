52 OF THE VEINS OF THE BRAIN. They are fraall, having little way to run; and before they become large trunks, they empty them- felves into the numerous leffer fmufes betwixt the dura mater and bafe of the. fcull. This is perhaps a provifion againft the preffure of the brain. In paf- fmg into thofe fmufes, the veins take a long oblique courfe betwixt the lamellae of the dura mater; which has given occafion to anatomifts to defcribe many intricate lefier fmufes. OF THE PARTICULAR SINUSES. Although by the term fmus we are to underftand the great veins of the brain, yet as having fome cir* eumftances peculiar to them it is well to diftinguilh them by a diftinct appellation. SUPERIOR LONGITUDINAL SINUS. This is a triangular channel, running in the falx from the crifta galli of the aethmoid bone to the cru- cial ridge of the occipital bone. It is not conflant in its origin. Sometimes it begins from a blind foramen before the crifta galli*. Sometimes from the orbital finusf. In fome fubjefts it begins, only oppofite to the fontanelle, or even further back, and then at once fwells out to a large fize. > - As * Malacarne, Haller, Gautier. ■f Thefe finufes as frequently are continued into the inferior longitudinal fmus or into the circular or eliptical fmus ; they are like azure ftreaks under the dura mater, covering the orbital procefs. “ Molti fra i voti biflunghi, ovali, tondi, irregulari, che fi vidono all’, “ angolo inferior del fono L.

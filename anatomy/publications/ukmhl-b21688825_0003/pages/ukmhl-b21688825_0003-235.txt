OF THE PARTICULAR NERVES. 209 courfe between the tibialis anticus, and the peroneus longus mufcles, and lower down betwixt the tibia and extenfor policis longus, continues giving off branches in rapid fucceffion, and when it arrives at the anular ligament, it is much diminilhed. Here it divides into the ramus dorfalis, pedis profundus and fuperficialis,— This divifion is made after the nerve has croffed under the tendon of the tibialis anticus mufcle, and, while it lies betwixt the lower heads of the tibia and fibula.— Although they are diftinguifhed by the name of deep and fuperficial branches, they are both deep compared with the extremities of the great and outer divifion of the peroneal nerve. The branch which lies molt to- wards the outfide of the foot, paffes under the extenfor digitorum brevis mufcle, and on the outfide of the tar- fus. It diftributes its branches to the extenfor digi- torum brevis, and interoflii mufcles. That branch which is more towards the infide of the foot, although diftinguifhed by the term fuperficialis, goes forward not only under the fafcia which covers the foot, but alfo under the tendons: and after dividing and again uniting, and after fending off fome fmall branches, it comes out betwixt the great toe and the fecond toe,- and fends numerous branches to their contiguous fur- faces. The GREAT SUPERFICIAL DIVISION of the FIBULAR nerve is fometimes double, or immediately fplits into two. Its firft branches are to the peroneus tertius, ex- tenfor longus digitorum, and to the peroneus brevis and fecundus. The trunk or principal divifion runs down tinder the head of the peroneus longus, and then com- Yol. Ill, . 3P ing

1$0 OF THE COATS OF THE EYE. The cornea poffeffes great fenfibility ; although much of the pain, from hard bodies flying into the eye, is to be attributed to the motion of the eye-lids, and the great fenfibility with which they are endued. When a fplinter of glafs or metal ffrikes and flicks in the cornea, in- flammation is excited ; in confequence of this, veffels carrying red blood flrike into it, or fhoot over its fur- face in a new film of membrane *. Petit thought he obferved firfl in a negroe, and afterwards in a variety of inflances, red lines in the cornea; which he con- ceived to be the anaflamofing of veffels. There are, befides, fays he, many circumftances which argue that there are blood-veffels in the cornea. When the eye receives a flroke, there is often blood effufed in its fubftance; abceffes, alfo, are found within it, and phly&aenae on its furface ; and in great inflammation of the eye, the cornea appears red ; which, he fup- pofed, muff be produced by the fame caufe which makes the albuginea red, viz. the enlargement of its veffels, and the circulation of red blood. But we muff not imagine, he continues, that, in the natural flate, red blood circulates in the cornea ; for the vef- fels are not to be feen with the microfcope ; nor are they penetrated by injeCtion ; nor do they appear in the foetus; nor, when little abceffes are formed in the cornea; but only when violence has been done by a flroke upon the eye. In an eye in which the tunica * I have found the fpark from iron, in blackfmiths and mafons, buried in the cornea for fcveral days (fome authors fay months), without exciting pain or much inconvenience. I have alfo more than once picked a little black Hough from the cornea, miftaldng it for a piece of iron, when it was only the conference of the injury. conjunctiva

I conceive that it is the membrana vafculofa tunicee retinas, or membrana vafculofa Ruyfchii, which forms the vafcular capfule of the lens in the foetus, and alfo the canal of Petit in the adult. The criftalline lens has, in the firfl place, its proper capfule, which fur- rounds it on all Tides: again, the tranfparent web of membrane that is continued onward from that part of the retina which has upon it the pulpy and nervous ex- panfion, fplits when it approaches the margin of the lens. One lamina goes round belling the lens, and the other paffes a little before it, forms an adhefion to the capfule of the lens, and is then reflected off to the points of the ciliary proceffes and to the membrana pupillaris of the foetus *. Betwixt thefe fplit laminas of the con- tinued membrane of the retina the canal, which fur- rounds the lens, is formed, The membrana vitrea is fimply reflected over the back of the lens, and has no part in forming the Petitian canal. Where the retina advances forward upon the ciliary proceffes,- it forms an adhefion, beyond which the medullary part is not continued ; but the membrana vafculofa pafling on- ward, as I have defcribed, embraces the lens, and the * In the foetus, as far as I have obferved, the proper capfule of the lens and the membrana pupillaiis lie in contact, but they do not adhere ; and while the membrana pupillaris is perfedlly red with in- jection, there is none to be feen on the fore part of the capfule. There is, indeed, no part of that furface which is afterwards to fecrete the aqueous humor, which could fecrete that fluid, betwixt the furface of the lens and membrana pupillaris: fo complete is the adhefion of the adventitious and vafcular tunic of the leps to the membrana pupillaris, lamina.

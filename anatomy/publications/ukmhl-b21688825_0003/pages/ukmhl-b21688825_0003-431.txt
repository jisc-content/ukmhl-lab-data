OF THE HUMAN EAR. 407 of E e 2 OF THE MEMBRANA TYMPANl. The membrane of the tympanum is extended over the circular opening of the bottom of the meatus ex- ternus. It has a little of an oval ihape, and lies over fomewhat obliquely, fo that its lower margin is further inward than the upper. Its ufe is, to convey the vi- brations or ofcillation of the atmofphere, collefted by the outer ear, inwards to the chain of bones in the tympanum. Although this membrane be tenfe, it is not ftretched uniformly like the parchment of a drum, but is drawn into a funnel-like lhape by the adhefion, of the long procefs of the malleus to its centre. It confifts of two layers of membrane, and has, naturally, no perforation in it; and the experiments of air and the fmoke of tobacco fent from the mouth through the ear, fucceed only in thofe who have had the membrane of the tympanum partially ruptured or eroded by ulcera- tion. This membrane is tranfparent; and when we look into the tube of the ear, and diredl a ftrong light into it, we obferve it to be of a Ihining tendinous appearance. The inner lamina of the membrana tympani is very vafcular. It has, indeed, been faid, to refemble the iris, both in its profufion of veffels, and in the manner if quam invaferat, partem exeferat atque abftulerat fie* ut ulceris “ cavitas cum extremo finiftrae tuba? orificio communicaret. Igitur “ quoties homo mollem turundam remediis imbutam in ulceri* “ cavitatem intrudebat; toties illico finiftra aure evadebat furdus, 4‘ talifque permanebat toto ex tempore quo turunda in ulcere relin- *' quebatur p. go.

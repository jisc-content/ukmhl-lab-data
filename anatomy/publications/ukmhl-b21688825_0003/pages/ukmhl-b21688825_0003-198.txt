172 OF THE PARTICULAR NERVES. nerve. It is of a foft confidence and reddifh colour, and it extends from the fcull to the tranfverfe procefs of the third vertebra. It gradually tapers downwards until it terminates in the ilender nerve, which in the neck is extremely frnall. This ganglion has much va- riety of lhape in different fubjeCts, and may be faid in general to receive twigs of nerves upon the back part; it gives them out upon the fore part. The fuperior cervical ganglion of the fympathetic nerve receives nerves from the fecond, third, and fourth cervical nerves, and even fometimes from the root of the phrenic nerve. It has alfo connections with the hypo-gloffal, par vagum, and gloffo-pharyngeal nerves. It fends out branches to unite with the gloffo- pharyngeal, and which follow that nerve in its diftribu- tion to the tongue and pharynx. Many of its branches furrounding the carotid artery form connections with the internal and external laryngeal nerves, and proceed in melhes, or form plexus along with the branches of the artery. Thefe may be followed to great mi- nutenefs. To be more particular in the defcription of thefe an- terior branches of the fympathetic nerve, they are called the nervi molles, or nervi vasorum. They are nerves peculiarly foft, with a greater proportion of cellular membrane; they fpread in net-works along the arteries, and form frequent connections by little knots like frnall ganglions. Claffed with thefe nervi vaforum, are branches which pafs forward from the upper ganglion of the fympathetic, to unite with fila- ments from the internal laryngeal nerve of the par vagum, and which form the external laryngeal nerve.

248 OF THE COATS OF THE EYE, circle on the fore part of the eye, which feems varie- gated with colours ; though this is a deception, owing to its perfect tranfparency. The circle of the cornea is, however, far from being regular ; its margin is flat towards the nofe. The cornea confifts of laminae ; betwixt which, there is interpofed a cellular fubltance, filled with a perfe&ly pellucid fluid *. Thefe cells feem, like the common cellular membrane of the body, to have a free com- munication with each other, fo that the fluid freely exudes, and as quickly is imbibed, by maceration. The fullnefs of the cornea, with the perfect tranfparency of the fluid, gives a brillancy to the eye, and is a fign of health ; the reverfe dims the eye, and, with the fal- len features, accompanies ill health. Steno obferved, and Petit confirmed, the faÂ£t f, that the pores on the furface of the cornea exuded the fluid which fills the cells of the cornea; and that, after the furface was carefully dried by preffure, the moiflure might be feen to form in drops upon the furface. The moiflure can be thus forced out from the pores of either furface of the cornea J. This moiflure becomes dull and clamy on the approach of death, and forms fometimes a pelicle over the cornea. The laxity with which the laminae of the cornea are connected, may be, in fome meafure, demonflrated, by taking it betwixt the finger and thumb ; we fhall then find, that the layers can be made to glide very freely on each other. In the foetus, and in young children, the cornea is of great thicknefs, * Subflantia fpongiofa Valfalvas, f See alfo Hovius, p. 82. f Zinn. 8 and

OF THE SENSES. 215 or the manner In which we perceive the objeCts of the fenfes, in the fame language, and by reference to the fame notions, which belong to the fenfations them* felves. From this fcantinefs and inaccuracy of lan- guage, it unavoidably happens, that very different ideas of the operation of the fenfes are exprefled by feveral men in the fame terms; and in attempting to convey our ideas in language more precife and definite, we are infenfibly led to materialize the faculties of the mind, and to make the operations of the fenfes merely inechanical. What other explanation can we give of theories, which fuppofe the nerves to be tubes carrying animal fpirits, or containing an elaltic ether ; or which reprefent them as vibrating cords, and reduce all the variety of fenfation to the difference of tenfion and tone ? Thefe are, indeed, what Dr. Reid calls them, ** unhandy engines for carrying images.‚Äù Nothing has Leen undertaken in philofophy but entire fyftems, fathoming at once the greateft depths of nature. The cuftom has been to frame hardy con- jectures ; and if upon comparing them with things there appeared fome agreement, however remote, to hold that as fully fufficient. What chimeras and monftrous opinions this method of philofophifing has brought forth, it would be more invidious than difficult to fpecify. Bacon and Newton laid down the principles of philofophifing on this bafis, that on no account are conjectures to be indulged concerning the powers and laws of nature, but we are to make it our endeavour, with all diligence, to fearch out by experiment the real and true laws by which the conffitution of things is Qjz regulated.

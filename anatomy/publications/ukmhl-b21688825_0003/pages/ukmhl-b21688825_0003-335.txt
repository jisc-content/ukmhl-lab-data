OF THE HUMORS OF THE EYE. 31I diftant from the iris, it was neceflary for their opponents to prove that the lens was clofe upon the pupil, and that the pofterior chamber of the aqueous humor was very fmall. It is agreed that, in the adult, the quantity of the aqueous humor amounts to five grains; in the fetus it is red, turbid, and weighs about a grain and a half, owing, in part, to*the comparatively greater thicknefs of the cornea. As it is natural to conceive that the aqueous humor flows from a vafcular furface, it is the moil generally received opinion, that it is derived from the points of the ciliary procefles and furface of the iris. Haller, particularly, and after him Zinn, have thought that the ciliary procefles were the fecreting bodies; but there is one argument which, in my mind, determines that thefe are not the foie fecreting parts, viz. that while the membrana pupillaris clofes up the communication betwixt the two chambers, I have obferved the anterior one to be full of the fluid, which of courfe muff have been fupplied from another fource than the ciliary pro- cefles. 1 fuppofe, therefore, that the vilous furface of the iris is the proper fecreting furface of the aqueous humor *. Zinn obferves, that Haller faw the menu * The opinion of Nuck is now out of the quefiion. He thought that he had difcovered particular aquedudts, which conveyed the aqueous humor into the anterior part of the eye ; but thefe are found to be nothing more than the fhort ciliary arteries which pierce the fore part of the fclerotica. M. Merry and Bonhomme, (fee Zinn, p. 143.) obferved, in an adult, the pupil clofed with a membrane, and, in this inftance, there was fcarcely any fluid in the anterior chamber, whilft the pofterior was turgid with fluid.

lS6 OF THE PARTICULAR NERVES* befides fupplying the diaphragm, fends down through the diaphragm (to the right fide of the vena cava) the ramus anaftamoticus. This communicates with the femilunar ganglion of the fympathetic, or with the di~ vifion of the folar or eseliac plexus which palfes along the phrenic arteries. From the phrenic artery of the left fide, there pafs down with the cefophagus fmall nerves which, appearing in the abdomen, unite with the cteliac ganglion, or fome of its divifions; and both phrenic nerves will be found by fome minute branches to unite to the par vagum. Thefe, however, are but minute branches. The great deftination of the phrenic nerve is to the dia- phragm. The branches ftrike out from the diaphragm like roots from a centre ; they pafs fome way only co- vered by the pleura, and then pierce into the fubftance of the mufcle. There are innumerable experiments upon living animals, which Ihew the connection of this nerve with the action of the diaphragm. When the nerve is ftimulated, the diaphragm is excited to con- traftion ; when cut, prelfed, or tied, it becomes re- laxed and inactive, and there is difficulty of refpiration j when the fpinal marrow is injured low in the vertebras of the neck, or in the vertebras of the back, the ex- ternal mufcles of refpiration ceafe to aÂ£t, but the dia- phragm Hill continues its function; and in this cafe, as obferved by Mr. Hunter, the patient lives for fome days, breathing by the diaphragm. If the phrenic nerves be divided in a living animal, the diaphragm ceafes to act, and the abdominal mufcles lofe their op- ponent mufcles, and remain as in expiration; but ftill the refpiration is continued by the motion of the ribs. %

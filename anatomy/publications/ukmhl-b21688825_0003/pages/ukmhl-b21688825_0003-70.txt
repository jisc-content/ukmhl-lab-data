48 OF THE VEINS OF THE BRAIN. infomuch, that fome anatomifts have denied its exifl- ence ; but through the whole ventricle there run certain folds or plaits of this membrane, which are fo loaded with veffels as to referable a flelhy fubltance, and to 1c 1$ altogether their refemblance of the lining membrane. The plaits, before they are unravelled, look like maffes of tortuous veifels, lying loofe and unconne&ed in the bottom of the ventricles. The Iargell portion of each plexus choroides comes up from the pofterior prolongation of the lateral ven- tricles ; they then run forwards. In each ventricle they lie in the groove, betwixt the thalamus nervi optici and corpus ftreatum ; and cover the tenia femicircularis ge- minum. Thefe two plexus of the lateral ventricles unite under the anterior crus of the fornix, and form a fmall plexus, which is continued upon the inferior furface of the velum interpofitum, and even into the third ventricle. Again, there is a plexus which lies in the fourth ventricle. Vicq d’Azyr alfo defcribes, as occafionally occuring, little infulated plexus attached to the veins, branching on the corpora llreata *. Thus each divifion of the brain has its choroid plexus. Thefe vafcular webs mull have an important ur X fhould conceive that they chiefly fecreted the fluids of the ventricle ; for I believe the tortuofity to be ti e moll unequivocal mark of the activity of its veflei * tc Sur le cote des ventriculeslateraux,j’ai quelquefois obferve .'s “ petits plexus choroides ifoles, que accompagnoient quelquef- i “ de ces rameaux des veins de Galien, que I’on voit paffer fouc !e “ taenia femicircularis, & s’etendra fur le corps {trie.” \ d’Azyr Memoir. l’Acad.

OF THE PARTICULAR NERVES. 191 and flexor digitorum; a fecond pafles to the pronator teres; and a third to the deep mufcles of the fore-arm, and to the flexors of the thumb particularly, and alfo to the pronator quadratus mufcle. The radial nerve, continuing its courfe down the fore-arm betwixt the flexor fublimis and profundus digitorum, fends off other branches to thofe mufcles. Before palling under the ligament of the wrift, it gives out a branch which emerges from the tendons, and pafles to the integu- ments, Ihort flexor, and abduftor mufcles of the thumb. The trunk of the radial nerve pafles with the ten- dons of the flexor mufcles of the fingers under the li- gament of the wrift. In the palm of the hand it di- vides into five branches;â€”the firft pafles to the abduc- tor and flexor pollicis brevis ; a fecond goes to the ad- du&or policis, and fide of the thumb next the fore- finger ; the third pafles to the fore-finger, and to the lumbricalis mufcle; the fourth to the fide of the fore and middle fingers; and the fifth to the fides of the middle and little finger. All thefe nerves, while in the palm of the hand, fend oft' branches to the lumbricales mufcles. 6. The ulnar nerve comes off from the lower part of the plexus in union with the internal cutaneous nerve. It defcends upon the infide of the arm, and is tied down by the fafcia, and then pafles behind the in- ternal condyle of the humerus. While above the bend of the arm, it gives oft' a fuperficial branch to the in- teguments on the infide of the arm, and the ulnar fide pf the forearm ; at the fame time it fends a mufcular 1 branch

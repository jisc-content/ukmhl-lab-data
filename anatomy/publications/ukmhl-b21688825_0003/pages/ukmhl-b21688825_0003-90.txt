64 OF THE VEINS OF THE BRAIN. from all the others ; it is an irregular cavity, full of fibrous cords traverfing it, which gives it a kind of cellular appearance. It is like a difeafed part into which the blood had been driven, till the cellular tex- ture had been diftended and partly deftroyed. After a minute injection, fmall arteries are feen to ramify among thefe fibres; the internal carotid artery rifes through it, and the fixth pair of nerves is involved in it, in their palfage from the fcull. This finus is the centre of the little finufes and veins of the anterior part of the bafe of the brain and cranium : four or five veins pour their blood into it, from the anterior lobes of the brain and the fofla filvii j fometimes, even the opthalmic veins open into this re- ceptacle *. The fuperior and inferior petrous finufes, and the bafilar finus, open into it behind; the circular before j the fphehoidal finufes and veins of the dura mater upon the fide ; while the right and left finufes often communicate by means of the tranfverfe finus. Befides thefe the petrous finufes have feveral commu- nications, or emiffaria as they are called, viz. by the in- ferior maxillary foramen, the funnel of the carotid artery, through which defcends a vein, (the vena fo- dalis arteriae carotidce,) which terminates in the pteri- goid plexus of veins, the fphenoidal fiffure, the inter- offeous finus of Malacarne f. * This vein, the vena angolana, makes a very remarkable emiffaria, but it is more probable that the blood in fuch veins runs inwards than that it efcapes from the fcull to the external veins.â€”Cum venie pofterioribus frequentes nexus init.

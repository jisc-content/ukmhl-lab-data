7o OF THE VEINS OF THE BRAIN. That the brain does receive fuch an impulfe, in violent coughing and draining, is fufficiently evi- dent from the rifing of its furface on thefe occafions, when it is accidentally laid open by fra&ure, or the trepan *. Although the obftru&ion of the jugular veins were to caufe no regurgitation of the blood; although the fmufes were fuppofed to have an effect in preventing the diflention of the veins, or return of the blood to the head; dill one effect of the continued aftion of the arteries is, to increafe the plethoric date of the brain, when there is a dagnation, or more or lefs re- mora, of the blood in the fmufes; and thence it is, that in every interruption to the free exit of the blood, the didention mud ultimately fall upon the extreme veffelsf. * The older phyficians, obferving the connection betwixt the motion of refpiration and of the brain, conceived that the air was drawn through the nofe and crebriform bone into thr brain, fo as to diftend it. Upon this hypothefis followed many wonderful cafes. We have already mentioned the hypothefis which fuppofed com- preflion and relaxation of the cerebrum and cerebellum alternately, by the action of the falx and tentorium. -j- We thall fay that thefe veffels cannot fuffer diftention, unlcfs there be fpace given for their inordinate dilatation, by blood propor- tionally fent out from the cranium. But there is a degree of diften- tion upon them, a tenfion which cannot be relieved, nor the con- traction of the arteries allowed. The impulfe from the heart and arteries is ftill continued, and is increafing the evil. Bleeding'here relieves this adlion, and diminiihes the danger; and by this means w<j pan fuit the activity of the veffels entering the brain, to the tem- porary remora in ihofe which convey the blood out of the head, c -V We

Off THE COATS OF THE EYE. 25* conjunctiva was mod minutely injedted, as well as the internal veflels of the eye, I had refolved, carefully to examine the ft ru ecu re of the cornea; and after a long maceration, in which it had greatly fwelled, I obferved a fet of veflels totally diftinct from the extremities of the minute blood-veflels. The minute blood-veflels which were injected, ftopt abruptly on the margin of the cornea. But thefe I now mention are particular â€¢ they are in great profufion, large, and perfectly pel- lucid j they are large towards the middle of the cornea, and diminifh towards the margin. Their free commu- nication formed a net-work deep in the thickened fub- ftance of the cornea. The ftze, perfect pellucidnefs, and intimate connection of thefe veflels, might perhaps incline one to call this a cellular ftructure. Mr. Home * fays, that an irritation on the edge of the cornea, and which includes the tunica conjunctiva, will produce greater inflammation, and more quickly, than a ftronger excitement would produce on the centre of the cornea. This remark is probably from obfer- vation ; but he adds, it is impoflible that the veflels of the cornea, which naturally parry lymph only, or ferurn, can be made to carry red blood, unlefs the irritation extends to feme neighbouring part fupplied with red blood. This, certainly, is an erroneous idea ; for the little opacities which furround fpiculse flicking in the cornea, the ulcerations on its furface, and little abcefles within its layers f, are the effedt of inflamina* * Philof.

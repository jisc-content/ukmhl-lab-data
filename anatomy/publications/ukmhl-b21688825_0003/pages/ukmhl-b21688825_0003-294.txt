CHOROID COAT AND IRIS. 270 CHAP. IV. PRACTICAL REMARKS DEDUCED FROM THE STRUCTURE OF THE CHOROID COAT AND IRIS. 1 - The choroid coat, ciliary precedes, and iris, being the mod vafcular parts of the eye, are frequently the feat of difeafe, and adminifter to the diforder in all violent internal affections of the organ. I had always conceived thefe parts to be chiefly active in the car- cinoma of the bulb of the eye, and I had lately an opportunity of obferving this in diffe&ion. In this difeafe, there is firft deep pain in the eye, from the inflammation and diforder of the vafcular coats; and often the effedt of the increafed action, within the eye, is known from its effedts in enlarging the veins on the furface of the eye-ball. Thefe veffels being active in their natural ftate, are very apt to become difeafed when diffurbed in their action; and although we fre- quently fee the eye quite funk, yet, when it is burft, and the vafcular coats are protuberant, a cancerous date of the eye is to be dreaded. When the eye is hurt by a blow; when inflam- mation fpreads from the cornea to the iris, in con- fequence of a fmall-pox pudule; when an ulcer of the cornea, or an incidon of it does not heal quickly, but allows the aqueous humor to didil out, and con- fequently

174 of THE particular nerves. defcends in the courfe of the trunk of the nerve, and forms, with other branches, the fuperior cardiac. This nerve, generally called nervus cordis super- ficial is, palfing down in the diredion of the trunk of the fympathetic nerve, and near the longus colli mufcle, is for fome length a very llender branch; but in its courfe it receives two, three, or four additional twigs from the fympathetic, and branches which come un- der the carotid artery from the pharyngeal nerves, or nervi modes. When this fuperior cardiac nerve is within an inch or two of the fubclavian artery, branches of union pafs betwixt it and the recurrent nerve of the par vagum; and branches of the nerves palling to the heart from the lower cervical ganglion, alfo join it. It then, attaching itfelf to the inverting membranes and Iheaths of the carotid and fubclavian arteries, forms with others a plexus of nerves, which run along the great velfels to the heart. The continued trunk of the fympathetic, where it emerges from the fuperior cervical ganglion, is ex- tremely finall. It defcends behind the carotid artery, and lies near to the fpine. When oppofite to the fifth and fixth cervical vertebras, the inferior cervical gang- lion of the fympathetic is formed. In this courfe, twigs of communication pafs betwixt it and the cer- vical nerves, or join it w'ith the beginning of the phre- nic nerve. But not unfrequently there are three cervical gang- lions formed by the fympathetic nerve; the fuperior, middle, and inferior ganglions : or it happens that we find the fympathetic nerve fplit into two branches in the

420 O? THE HUMAN EAR. had minute veflels diftributed on their furfaces: but thefe veflels he fuppofed to creep along the naked bone independently of any membrane. This, how- ever, is contrary to all analogy. Thefe bones, as well as the cavity of the tympanum, are covered with a very fine membrane or periofteum, which, after a minute injeftion, is feen covered with many fmall and diftinft veflels, as well as with intermediate extravaf- cular effufions of the inje&ion, as happens in injecting in other membranes. When the tympanum becomes difeafed, there is fetid matter collected, the membrane of the tympanum fullers, and the fmall bones are fometimes difcharged. In fuch a cafe, we have little farther to do than, by injections, to prevent the matter from accumulating. But, let us not confound this ferious caufe of deafnefs with the flighter fuppurations in the outer pafiage of the tube : although fuch fuppurations in the tube of the ear are apt, when negle&ed, to deflroy the membrane of the drum or tympanum, and to fpread difeafe to thefe internal parts. Authors make a difplay of the difeafes of the mem- brane of the tympanum under the titles rel^xatio, tenfio, nimia, induratio, and diruptio tympani *. We have feen how little rupture of the membrane affe&s the hearing, and may thence conclude, that thefe fan- taftic imaginings about tenfion and relaxation of the membrane deferve little notice. The idea of relaxa- tion of the membrane of the tympanum, I have no doubt, has arifen from the effe<3: of cold and moilt * See Du Verney de Ogano Auditus, p. 41. weather

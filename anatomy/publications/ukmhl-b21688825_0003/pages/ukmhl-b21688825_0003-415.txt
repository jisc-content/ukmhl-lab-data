OF THE ORGAN OF HEARING 391 of Dd 2 diffe&ion. Each of the cartilaginous canals is dilated at one of its extremities into a little belly, which is called the ampulla. The auditory nerve in cartilaginous fifhes # is firfl divided into two fafciculi, which are again fubdivided into lelfer nerves. Thefe go to the three facculi lapii- lorum, and to the ampullulae of the femicircular canals. Before the divifion of the nerve peculiar to the facculus pierces it, and is finally diflributed, it forms a fingular and intricate network of filaments. The branches to the ampullulse are raifed on a partition - which is oppofed to the mouth of the cylindrical part of the tube. In the fpinous fifhes, the three femicircular canals unite in a common belly; but in cartilaginous fifhes, the poflerior femicircular canal is diftindt from the others. In fifhes, all the parts of the ear are filled with a matter of a gelatinous confidence, or vifcid fluidity; and the whole facculi and femicircular canals are fur- rounded with fluid. That jelly is the mofl fufceptible of vibration, is evident, when we fill a glafs, and allow a body to fall into it; for then the delicate vibration is communicated to the finger on the outfide of the glafs, or, by flriking the glafs, we may obferve the tremulous motion of the jelly. The femicircular canals, it is evident, are well adapted to receive the extenfive vibrations communicated through the bones * The fifth pair of nerves in fifh anfwers to the feventh in man : it has the fame divifion into the portio mollis and dura.

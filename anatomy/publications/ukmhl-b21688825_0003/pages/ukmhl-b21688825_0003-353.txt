ANATOMY OF THE HUMORS'. 329 lowed to dilate. From this it appears, how toofe the ideas of thofe are who can fpeak of trying firft to couch, and if that is not found to fucceed, then to perform the operation of # extraction. I conceive the attempt with the needle to preclude the operation of extracting, for thefe reafons :â€”An unfuccelsful attempt to deprefs will, in general, be a laboured and reiterated motion of the point of the needle, which muff occafion inflammation and an adhefion firmer than is natural. Again, in couching, the lens is removed from the axis of the eye fo far only that, in the cafe of the extracting being at- tempted, it no longer equally oppofes itfelf to the pupil, the confequence of which muff be, the efcape of the vitreous humor and the detention of the lens. In regard to the place at which the couching needle is to be introduced, we may obferve, that we are di- rected, by the older furgeons, to pierce the fclerotic coat very near to the edge of the cornea, becaufe they were afraid of hurting the lens with the needle ! The idea then entertained was, that the cataraCt was a membrane hung behind the pupil and before the lens. The older furgeons had the idea that the needle entered before the lens, and palled at once into the aqueous humor. We are to difregard thefe injunctions of furgeons who directed the needle to be introduced with the idea of avoiding the lens; for, while their notions regarding the difeafe were erroneous, their rules of operating could not be correCt: accordingly, we find them dif- fering in their directions as to the place of piercing the cornea ; fome directing- us to pierce it at the diftance of one line from the edge of the cornea, others at the diltance of four lines and a half. 7 3 .

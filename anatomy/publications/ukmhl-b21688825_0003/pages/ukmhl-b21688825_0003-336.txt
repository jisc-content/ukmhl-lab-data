312 OF THE HUMORS OF THE EVE. brana pupillaris diftended and bulged forwards by the aqueous humor in the pofterior chamber. It is fcarcely neceflary to fay, that this muft always take place when the cornea is firft opened in demonftrating that mem- brane, whether there be a watery fluid behind it or not. But I believe I fhall be able to prove, that the fecretion of the ciliary procefles can have little power of filling the poflerior chamber, even from the connexion of membranes behind the membrana pupillaris in the foetus. The aqueous fluid is perpetually undergoing the change of fecretion and abforption, and this is the reafon of its quick renewal when it has been allowed to efcape by puncture of the cornea. The ancients were not ignorant of the quick regeneration of this fluid. It Was proved to the moderns by a charlatan, Jofephus Burrhus (ventofus homo, qui in carcere Ro- mano perut). Before the phyficians of Amflerdam he punctured the cornea of a dog; then inftilling his liquor under the cornea, he bound up the eye; in a few days he took off the bandage, and fhowed them the cornea again diftended with the aqueous humor. It was foon found that the inftilled fluid was of no kind of confequence. Redi and Nuck made many experi- ments, and it was found that the aqueous humor was regenerated in the courfe of 24 hours. When the difputes regarding the catarad ran high, and when, to make new diftin&ions in the difeafe was taken as a mark of practical knowledge and of acute- nefs, there was akind of catarad attributed to the aqueous humor. When the aqueous humor became turbid, white, and opaque, and obfcured the pupil, they were abfurd enough to call this a cataract. The turbid ftate *3 of

It cannot but appear ftrange, that the very fource or centre, to which every fenfation is referred, fhould itfelf be deftitute of fenfation ; yet, we are affured, by the experiments of Haller and Zinn, that the cortical fub- ftance of the brain has been irritated, without the animal being convulfed, or giving figns of pain * ; but when the medullary part of the brain is irritated, the effedts are inftantaneous, and the animal is convulfed. It has been obferved, that as the injury of a nerve caufes con- vulfions, fo does that of the central parts of the brain, from which the nerves originate ; but this fenfibility f diminiih.es towards the furface of the brain J. We fee a diilindion betwixt the flruclure and function of the nerves and of the brain ; or rather betwixt the cineri- tious fubltance of the brain and the nerves. For, al- though we muft neceffarily conclude, that the cineri- tious fubftance is an important and, perhaps, the moil effential part of the fyilem, ilill it does not evince, by * But, like the infenfible membranes, it becomes irritable by dif- eafe; or by preffure, which afFefts the univerfal function of the brain. Vander Linden, in his Medicina Phyfiologica (1613), brings proof of the infenfibility of the brain. See the general enumeration of the effefts of wounds in the brain. Haller Phyljol. Tom. iv. &c.

This gentleman was only in a fmall degree deaf from the lofs of the membrane; but his ear remained nicely fufceptible of mufical tones, “ for he played well on the flute, and had frequently <e borne a part in a concert; and he fung with much “ tafte, and perfectly in tune.” This cafe puts afide, at once, that theory which fuppofes the mufical ear to depend on the minute play of the mufcles of the tym- panum- It appears, then, that the membrane of the tym- panum may be deftroyed, that the bones may be wafhed out by matter formed in the tympanum, and (till the patient retain the ufe of the organ. But this is only while the ftapes retains its place; for, if this bone be alfo deftroyed, the membrane of the foramen ovale will be deftroyed, and the fluids of the labyrinth be allowed to flow out, or be otherwife loft. We fee, that, if the chain of bones, and only a part of the membrana tympani be left, ftill this Aired of mem- brane, if it be not detached from the handle of the malleus, will vibrate in the air, and communicate thofc vibrations through the other bones to the veftibule. We fee, alfo, that though the bones only remain, and though they be detached from the membrane of the tympanum, the found will ftill be communicated. We fee, that a rupture of the membrane will not deftroy the organization fo far as to prevent the hearing, unlefs there follow clots of blood or inflammation, fuppura- tion, or fungus. When Mr. Cooper found that the membrana tympani could be torn without injuring the organ, he did not ftop fhort in his inveftigation: but as he foynd, by daily experience, that obftru&ion of < ' the

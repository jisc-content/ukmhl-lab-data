GF THE HUMORS OF THE EYE. 317 Every anatomlft acknowledges the exiftence of the Petitian canal, and a diftinfl: capfule to the lens is alfo pretty generally allowed. But many deny that the vitreous membrane has two plates, without obferving that the exiftence of the Petitian canal is a proof of the Splitting of the membrana vitrea, on the fore part at leaft. Some believe that the vitreous membrane fpllts and involves the lens, and forms its capfule ; but the difficulty, on this fuppofition, is ftill to account for the formation of the canal which furrounds the lens; for as the fluids on the furface of the lens and within its capfule have not admiffion to the canal, the canal mult be diftindt; and, indeed, fometimes we blow up the circular canal, and fometimes, by a wrong pundture, the capfule of the lens itfelf; but not both at once. Seeing, then, that thefe cavities are diftindt, fome anatomifts.have admitted that the membrana vitrea is double; that the lens has its proper capfule; and that the lamina of the vitreous membrane, coming near the margin of the lens, fplits and involves it in a fecond coat, (as in fig. 2.) Others have fuppofed that the anterior layer of the vitreous humor does not pafs over the anterior furface of the proper capfule of the lens, but only adheres to the edge of the capfule of the lens, and forms the Petitian canal. There are yet others who have defcribed the membrana vafculofa of the retina as forming the capfule of the lens. This is one of thofe pieces of anatomy which provokes us to con- tinued refearch, and mortifies us with continual dis- appointment. If this piece of anatomy, when invefti- gated in the eye of an adult, is difficult to be under- ftood, it is infinitely more complicated in the eye of the foetus;

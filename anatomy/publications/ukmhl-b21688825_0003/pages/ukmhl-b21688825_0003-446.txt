OF THE HUMAN EAR. 422 a thin tympanum, will molt probably injure the brain *, after bleeding from the ear. Sometimes fuppuration follows f ; and blood flowing thus from the membrane of the tympanum, or other part of the ear, runs back into the cavity of the tympanum, and, filling it with coagulum, caufes deafnefs, by obllruding the free motion of the bones and membrane. Mr. Cooper, in a cafe of this kind, pundured the membrane, and, after a difcharge of blood which continued for ten days, the hearing was gradually reftored. It is fup- pofed by that gentleman, that the blood effufed be- comes, in fome inllances, organized, fo as to obliterate the tympanum caufing permanent deafnefs. I think it is more likely that the blood has, in fuch cafes, de- ftroyed the mechanifm by fuppuration. The danger in fuppuration and caries of the tympa- num is, that the difeafe may penetrate backward into the maltoid cells and labyrinth, or into the brain itfelf; for inflammation and fuppuration fo confined amongft the deep recedes of the bone, mull give great torture, and be apt to extend the mifchief to the brain, or throw out matter on the infide of the cranium, the efted of which mull be mortal. Such, I think, I have ieen to be nearly the efted of fuppuration deep in the ear. In a man who had been deaf for many years, and who was killed by a fradure of the lkull, I found the cells cf the temporal bones filled with matter, and * When Valfalva found the ventricles of the brain full of blood, and blood alfo in the tympanum, he fuppofed that the blood in the latter was derived from the brain through certain foramina which he difcovered.

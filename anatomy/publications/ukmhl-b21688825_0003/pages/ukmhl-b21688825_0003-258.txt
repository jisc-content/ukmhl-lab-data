OF THE EYE. 234 The curately on the retina, but before it. Thus, in %. 7., the convexity of the cornea, the lucid ante- rior part of the eye, or the focal powers of the lens, being too great for the length of the axis of the eye, the image is formed at a before the rays reach the furface of the re- tina ; and after coming accurately to the point, they again begin to diverge; which diverg- ing rays, ftriking the furface of the retina, give the indiftind vifion of a near-fighted perfon. But as this indiflindnefs of vifion proceeds from no opacity, but only the difproportion of the convexity of the eye to the diameter, the defed is correded by the concave glafs, a fig. 8. ; for, the effect of this glafs being the reverfe of the convex, it caufes the rays to fall upon the furface of the eye, fo far diverging from the per- pendicular line, (which is exemplified in fig. 1.), as to correct the too great convergence caufed by the con- vexity of the humors. But, when a near-fighted per- fon has brought the objed near enough to the eye to fee it diftindly, he fees more minutely, and, confe- quently, more clearly; becaufe he fees the objed larger, and as a perfon with a common eye does, when affifled with a magnifying glafs or convex lens. 3

30 OF THE MEMBRANES OF THE BRAIN. dullary fubftance from the bafe of the brain. Ruyfch and Albinus have made the moft minute inje&ions of this part of the brain. The former conceived it to confift entirely of velfels; but Vicq. dâ€™Azyr and Al- binus found always, in their experiments, that a great proportion of it remained colourlefs after the moil; mi- nute injection. It is, indeed, very improbable, that fo foft a body fhould be entirely compofed of veflels'. How, for example, can we fuppofe the comiifura mollis, or cineritious matter, on the Tides and bottom of the third ventricle, or the almoft tranfparent lamina, which we find in fome parts, to be compofed of veffels ? The white medullary substance appears to be a pulpy mafs. We obferve no peculiarity of ftru&ure in it towards the furface of the brain, where it is con- tiguous to the cortical matter; but towards the origin of the nerves it takes a more fibrous appearance. This appearance of fibres is not owing to any peculiarity in the medullary matter, but to the manner in which the pia mater involves it. The medullary matter, being chiefly internal, has every where through the brain a communication from the fore to the back part, from the upper part to the bafe; from the great central part it extends in form of fhriae, into the corpora ftriata and thalami; it invefts the eminences in the lateral ventricles ; and thofe upper parts have communication with the medullary fubftance of the bafe. M. Meckel found, upon comparing the brains of an European and of a negro, that the medullary matter differed very much in colour.. In the negro, inftead of the whitenefs of the European, the medullary matter was of a yellow colour, and nearly like the cineritious matter:

OF THE PARTICULAR NERVES. 13! that the other nerves which ramify on that membrane, do, on the other hand, contribute nothing to the fenfe of fmell, as we find that the inflammation of the pituitary mem- brane, w hich raifes the fenfibility of the branches of the fifth pair of nerves, does in no degree make thofe of the olfadtory nerve lefs acute. The membrane is painfully -inflamed, but the fenfe of fmell is deadened. In at- tending to the delicate fenfibility of the nerves of the fenfes, we negledt to take into account the lefs promi- nent, but no lefs curious peculiarities in the fenfations, and fympathies of the common nerves. The fenfes of tafte or fmell are not more diftindt from each other, or from common fenfation, than are the peculiar fenfations which belong to the fenfibility of the feveral vifcera. The ftomach and inteftinal canal pofiefs as great a difcrimnating power as the organ of tafte, although the fenfations are lefs perfectly conveyed to the fenforium. There is a variety in the fufceptibility of the feveral or- gans and vifcera, a diftindt fenfation and proportioned adtion and eledtion w'hich is elfential to the order and ceconomy of the general fyftem. This is confpicuous in the variety of the affedtions in remote parts, when food, medicine, or poifon is received into the body. Thefe peculiarities in the impreflion of which each or- gan is fufceptible, are fo far diftindt as to be eflential to the due excitement of that organ; and are yet fo general, as to connedt, in one combined adtion, the whole fyftem, and to occafion fymphaies in remote parts, which perplex us, and give that degree of intricacy to the living adtions, which renders medicine an uncertain art.

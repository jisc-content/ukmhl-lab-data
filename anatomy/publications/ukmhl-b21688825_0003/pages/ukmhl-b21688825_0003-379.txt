OF SEEING IN GENERAL. -355 reded laterally, though there are exceptions; as thofe fifhes which are flat, and fwim at the bottom, have their eyes direded upward. In many infeds, the furface of the eye has no refemblance to the cornea of viviparous animals; but when examined with the mi- crofcope, it is feen to confift of a number of tubercles, each of which is as a diflind eye. In others, the eye is removed to the extremity of the moveable tenaculse. Very large animals, as the whale, elephant, rhino- ceros, hippopotamos, have, in proportion to their bodies, very fmall eyes : fo have the animals which live much under ground ; and, in general, a large eye is a fign of thÂ£ animal being able to fee in obfcure light, becaufe there is proportionably a greater number of rays admitted into the eye. For the fame reafon, flflies have a peculiarly large eye and dilatable pupil, becaufe the water is a 'more obfcure medium, and, from the occafional roughnefs of its furface, much darkened and variable. We mull conclude, that in thefe varieties of the eyes, where there is a difference in number, pofition, and natural motion, there are different laws of viflon adapted to thefe peculiarities and the exigencies of the animals. If we are to judge from analogy, we may fuppofe, that in many animals, there is no correfpond- ence between points of the two retinas, or it is of a different kind from ours. In thofe _ which have im- moveable eyes, the centre of the two retinas will not correfpond fo as to give the idea of one objed, but of diflind objeds, and in their refpedive places. In other animals, correfponding points would give falfe appearances; and in fuch as turn their eyes in all di- redions.

246 OF THE COATS Of THE eVe. of bone *, while in fillies it is in part cartilaginous f, buff thin and tranfparent, fo that there appears a very beautiful fpotted coat beneath it. There are alfo feen in the fclerotic of fifhes little white granules like glands. The vagina of the optic nerve can be feparated into two laminae § ; the outer one is obferved to unite in- timately with the outer part of the fclerotic coat, while the inner lamina of the vagina is continuous with its inner furface. The pia mater, too, fays Zinn, when it has pierced the foramen in the fclerotic coat, alongft with the fubftance of the nerve, expands upon the inner furface of this coat, and extends even to the cornea, and forms one of its intimate laminae. This muff be only that part of the pia mater which inverts- the optic nerve, or, more fcriclly fpeaking, that mem- brane which Hands in the fame relation to the nerve that the arachnoid coat does to the brain; for the membrane, which finks into intimate union with the nerve, accompanies it even in forming the retina |.

X It may be well, in this place, to detail at once the opinions of the chief fupporter of that fcheme of the coats of the eye, which derives them all from the inveiling membranes of the brain and optic fterve. M. le Cat, in his Traite des Sens, deferibes them thus:— When the optic nerve has entered the orbit, the dura mater, which fjrrounus it, fplits into two laminae; the external one attaches to the orbit, and forms trie perioileum, the other forms the vagina of thtf nerve. In the angle formed by thefe, the mufcles of the eye arife. This, continued (heath of the nerve, he continues, expands into the globe of the eye, as the mafs of glafs is blown into a bottle. The dura

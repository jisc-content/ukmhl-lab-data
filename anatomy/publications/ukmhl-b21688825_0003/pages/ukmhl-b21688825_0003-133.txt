OF THE VENTRICLES OF THE BRAIN. I07 confufion; fo that when we make a fe&ion of the crura cerebri near to their union with the pons varolii, we ob- ferve a fubftance of a dark-brown colour, furrounded with white or medullary matter. In the angle of the union of thefe crura cerebri, behind the corpora albi- cantia, and before the protuberance of the pons varolii, we obferve a matter lefs perfectly white than the fur- rounding medullary fubftance, which forms a floor to the third ventricle. This part is perforated with a great many holes, and is the fubjiance perforee of Vicq d’Azyr *, and gives origin to the third pair of nerves along with the crura themfelves. CRURA CEREBELLI. The crura cerebelli are more expofed than thofe of the cerebrum; the latter lying deeper, and being compa- ratively fmaller. They are formed by the union of the internal medullary part of the cerebellum, or the arbor vitas. They are altogether compofed of medullary mat- ter, except near the pons varolii, where we obferve a mixture of coloured ftriae. PONS VAROLII. The pons varolii, tuber annulare, or nodus cerebri is formed by the union of the crura cerebri and cerebelli j thofe names are almoft defcriptive of its * Vicq d’Azyr makes three divifions of this fubjiance perforee— lit, At the roots of the tubercles, from whence the firft pair of nerves emerge betwixt the roots of thofe nerves, and near the origin of the optic nerves. 2d.

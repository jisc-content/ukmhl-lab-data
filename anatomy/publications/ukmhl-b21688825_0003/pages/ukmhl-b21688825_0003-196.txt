OF THE PARTICULAR NERVES. 17Â° LUMBAR NERVES. The lumbar nerves are five in number. The fird comes out under the fird lumbar vertebra, and the others in fuccelfion. Their trunks are covered by the pfoas magnus. They pafs very obliquely downward, and the three lowed are of remarkable fize. In the general didribution, we may fird remark the poderior branches, which go backwards to the mufcles which fupport and extend the fpine. Again, the an- terior branches; which give, id, additional branches to the fympathetic nerve as it paffes over the vertebras of the loins, and by which it is fupported and reinforced till it terminates in the pelvis; 2dly, they have fre- quent connection with each other, and with the lad nerve of the back, and fird of the facrum ; 3dly, they fend out branches, delicate but of great extent, to the mufcles of the loins and back, and to the abdominal mufcles and integuments of the groin and fcrotum ; 4thly, the principal anterior branches of the lumbar nerves pafs down to form (along with the great nerves of the facrum) the anterior crural nerve, the obturator, and the great ifchiatic nerve. SACRAL NERVES. The nerves which come out from the extremity of the medulla fpinalis, or cauda equina, through the fa- crum, are in general five in number. Sometimes there is one more or lefs. The fird divifion of each facral nerve is into thofe branches which pafs out by the poderior foramina of the facrum, and thofe which, by 4 the

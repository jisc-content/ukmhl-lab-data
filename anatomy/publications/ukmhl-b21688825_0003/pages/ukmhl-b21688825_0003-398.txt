374 OF SOUND. the joint effect of the vibrations of the folids, and of the air. There is no body impervious to found, or, in other words, incapable of tranfmitting the vibration. That found is communicated through the medium of the air, we know from the circumftance, that a bell, when [truck in a vacuum, gives out no found: and again, from this, that the condenfed Hate of the atmofphere affords an eafier communication of found, and conveys it to a greater diftance. The velocity of the impreflion tranfmitted by the common air, is computed at 1130 feet in a fecond ; and found, when obltrudted in its direct motion, is reflected with a velocity equal to that with which it flrikes the folid body by which its progrefs is interrupted. That water conveys the vibrations producing found, has been proved by experiment. It was once the fay- ing of naturalifts, that, to fuppofe fifhes to have the organ of hearing, would be to conceive that an organ were bellowed upon them without a pollibility of its being of ufe. But we are affured of the fad, that, on the tinkling of a bell, filhes come to be fed * ; and it was the cuftom for the filhermen on the coafl of Britany, to force the filh into their nets by the beating of drums fj as our illanders are at prefent accultomed to * Boyle. f M. l’Abbe Nollet, Acad.

If the fenfation of one eye be weak, it is very liable to be neglected altogether, and that eye is apt to wander from the true axis ; and if the perfon be care- lefs, or given to diflort his eyes in childilhnefs, a per- manent fquint may be given to the eyes. Another caufe of fquinting, in children, is the being fo laid in their cradle, that the light ftrikes obliquely into one of the eyes, whilll the other cannot fee it; by which means one of the eyes only comes by degrees to be diredled to the light while the fenfation of the other is difregarded. What is very extraordinary in fquint- ing, is the correfpondence in the mufcles of the eye, notwithftanding the great diflortion of the eye-ball; for, when both eyes are open, as the found eye turns in all variety of directions to the furrounding objects, the other eye hill follows it, but preferves its diltance, fo as in a manner to avoid all interference.

As this is evidently produced by the affection of the mufcles moving the- eye-ball*, fmce any change upon the retina could not give occafion to fucb diflortions in a flate of infen- libility, we may naturally conclude, that fquinting is fometimes the confequence of irregular aCtion of the mufcles j for if thofe tranfient caufes are apt to * The command of the voluntary mufcles is fivft loft in intoxica- tion ; and, therefore, it is more likely that the mufcles fhould lofe thejr natural ailien and cefrefpondence than the retina. affe&

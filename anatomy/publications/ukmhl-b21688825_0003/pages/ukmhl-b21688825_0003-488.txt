Thefe branches have a diredion upward, and unite into a trunk, which pafles from the upper part of the gland acrofs the cheek over the origin of the mafeter mufcle : it then pierces the buccinator mufcle, and opens upon the inner furfac.e of the cheek, oppofite to the fecond or third dens molaris. This dud has ftrong white coats ; but, although the mouth of the dud is very fmall, the dud itfelf is delatable to a great fize, fo that tubes of a confiderable fize have flipt into it, and been buried in the body of the gland. The soCia parotiDis is a fmall gland, (which, however, is by no means conftant), feated on the upper fide of the dud of the parotid gland, and juft Under the margin of the cheek-bone. It opens by a lefler dud into the great dud of Steno.

The fubmaxillary gland is of a regular oval figure; it lies On the tendon of the digaftric tnufcle* and is defended by the angle of the lower jaw, Whil6 it is generally conneded with, or involves the toot of the focial artery. It is regularly lobulated; and its dud pafles forward between the geniogloffus and my- lohyoideuS, and under the fublingual gland. Thd Openings of the fubmaxillary duds, or duds of Whar- ton, are very eafily diftinguilhed. They open very near each other on each fide of the frenum linguae, very near the gums of the dentes incifivi; fo that they appear as if tied down by the frenum. When thefe are

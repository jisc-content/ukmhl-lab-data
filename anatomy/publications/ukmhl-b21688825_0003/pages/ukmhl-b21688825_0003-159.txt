OF THE PARTICULAR NERVES. 133 the eye-balls. They pafs upwards from their origin ; and then diverging, they penetrate the dura mater un- der the extreme point of the tentorium; they defcend again by the fide of the cavernous finus, and pafs out of the cranium by the foramen lacerum of the fphenoid bone. The nervus motor oculi having come into the focket divides into two branches: The inferior branch pafles forward along the outfide of the optic nerve; it then divides into thefe branches: 1. To the adduftor mufcle. 2. To the re&us inferior. 3. To the external oblique and to the lenticular ganglion. But the. branch of the third nerve, which, with the fifth, forms this little ganglion, is, by no means, con- ftantly derived from this branch. The lesser and superior branch of the third, is diftributed to the redtus fuperior oculi and levator palpebrae fuperioris. FOURTH PAIR OF NERVES, TROCHLEARES, OR PATHETICI. Thefe nerves are very fmall. Their origin, from about the tubercula quadrigemina, and their long courfe under the bafe of the brain, have been already deferr- ed ; after proceeding a confiderable way, incafed in the duplicature of the dura mater, where it forms the extreme point of the tentorium, they pafs amongft the lamellae of the dura mater, where it forms the cavernous finus. They pafs by the outfide of the third pair of nerves; turn round fo as to be above them, and make their egrefs through the foramen lacerum of the s K3 fphenoid

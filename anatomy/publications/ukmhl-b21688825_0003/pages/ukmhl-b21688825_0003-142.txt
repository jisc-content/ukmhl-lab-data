THE ORIGIN OF THE NERVES. ii 5 SECOND TAIR ; OR, OPTIC NERVES *. The optic nerves arife from the poflerior part of the optic thalami, and alfo (and perhaps more diredllyf) from the tubercula quadrigemina. When we trace the optic nerves backwards into the traclus opticus, we find them taking a circle round the crura cerebri, then en- larging, each forms a tubercle towards the back part of the thalamus opticus, and afterwards unites with the poflerior tubercle of the thalamus opticus; at the fame time a divifion flretches towards the tefles, while be- twixt the poflerior tubercle of the thalamus opticus and the nates, there is an intermediate communication. When thofe tubercles are fairly expofed by feparating the mid- dle lobes of the brain, and differing away the tunica arachnoides and pia mater, they are feen fmooth, and formed of medullary matter; which is uniformly con- tinued from the one to the other, following their gentle convexities with an uninterrupted furface. Within thofe tubercles is a mixture of cineritious and medul- lary matter, and, efpecially, there is a diflindt flreak which paffes from the traclus opticfis to the nates. Thus there is a communication betwixt the nates and tefles, and the optic nerve; but we mull flill confider the nerve as arifing in a peculiar manner from the* thalamus opticus, while at the fame time it receives additions from the crura cerebri, where the nerve adheres clofely to the crura. * The optic nerves Were the firft pair of Galen and many of the. older anatomifts, they being ignorant of the olfaftory nerves. •j- “ Les nerfs optiques naiflent en arriere des eminences nates et “ tefles vers la partie pofterieure de celles que Tor. nomme les couches u des nerfs optiques.” Sabatier.

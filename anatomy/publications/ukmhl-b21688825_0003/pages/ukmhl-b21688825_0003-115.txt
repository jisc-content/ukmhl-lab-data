OF THF. VENTRICLES OF THE BRAIN. 89 des : we do not fee them fully until we have lifted the fornix and the velum or membrane which ftretches under the fornix. They are fomewhat of an irregular oval fhape; they are whiter than the corpora ftriata, their furface being chiefly of medullary matter. Inter- nally they are cineritious; and the medullary and cine- ritious matter is blended in ftrite like the anterior tu- bercles of the ventricles on the corpora ftriata. The thalami nervorum opticorum, having their con- vex furface towards each other, unite under the fornix by what is called the commissura mollis, in oppo- fition to the commiflura magna, which is the corpus caliofum; ihe commiflura anterior, which unites the fore part of the corpora fl riata; and the commiflura pofterior, which is yet to be defcribed. Thus the foft commilTure of the brain, or the union of the optic thalami, is fo foft that the flighted force will tear it, or in difleftion, the parts being unequally fup- ported, the thalami will be feparated and this connec- tion loft *. After fuch feparation of the tubercles there remains very little appearance of their having been united. Sabbattier, after the molt careful difle&ion, fays exprefsly that he could never obferve this union, and he conceives, that in the fmoothnefs of the conti- guous fuffaces he has a proof of there never being fuch a union; but he goes on to fay, cc The fruits of my “ refearch were, that I conftantly found a foft cord of a “ cineritious colour, and about a line or a line and a “ half in diameter palling betwixt them.” * Morgagni and Vicq d’Azyr fay they have feen this commif- lure double : it may, however, have been a partial laceration of it.

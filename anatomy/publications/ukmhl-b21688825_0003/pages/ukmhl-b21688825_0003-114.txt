A fuperficial horizontal fedtion of the corpora ftriata fhows thofe ftrise connected with the medullary matter of the middle and pofterior lobe. A deeper incihon brings into view a mafs of cineritious fubftance be- twixt thofe ftrise and the medullary matter of the middle lobe. Another incifion fiiows the courfe of the ftrise altered, and brings into view the connexion betwixt the corpora ftriata of each fide, by means of the anterior commiffure f. The commissura anterior is a cylindrical me- dullary cord, which unites the fore and lower part of the corpora ftriata, and which fpreads its connections for a full inch and a half into the middle lobe of the brain upon each fide. We fee it ftretched tranfverfely immediatelv under the anterior crura of the fornix.

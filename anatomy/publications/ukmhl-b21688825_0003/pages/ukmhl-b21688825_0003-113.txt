OF THE VENTRICLES OF THE BRAIN. 87 ning or termination ; they are the connefted folds and plicae of the internal membrane of the ventricles loaded with veffels j but to defcribe them intelligibly we mail, notwithflanding, trace them in this manner. The plexus of the lateral ventricles rife from the bottom of the inferior horns of thefe ventricles betwixt the pe- dunculi or crura cerebri and the termination of the hippocampi; they lie large and flelhy-like in that lower horn. As they rife into the fuperior level, they are at their greateft fize (there they have often a dif- eafed appearance, being hard, and as if fchirrous or full of little vehicles or hydatids) ; they then pafs for- wards and inwards, diminifhing in thicknefs until they coalefce under the fornix, and immediately behind the communication betwixt the ventricles. The plexus of the third ventricle, formed by the union of thofe of the lateral ventricles, turns back upon the lower furface of the velum, and is comparatively very fmalh The corpora striata are fmooth, cineritious convexities in the fore part of the lateral ventricle. They are fomewhat of the fhape of a pear; they are obtufe forwards; they approach each other towards the fore part with a regular convexity, and they are nar- row as they pafs backwards, feparating at the fame time; their pofterior extremity being as it were pufhed out by the thalami nervorum opticorum, Thefe laft lie more under the back part of the fornix, and are more concealed when the lateral ventricle only is laid open. Thefe bodies are called ftriata, from the inter- mixture of the medullary matter, which gives the ap- pearance of (Iris when they are cut. They defcend down to the bafe, and give origin to the firft pair, or G 4 olfaftory

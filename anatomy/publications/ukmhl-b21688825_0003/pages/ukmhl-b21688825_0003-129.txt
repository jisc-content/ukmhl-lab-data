OF THE VENTRICLES OF THE BRAIN* iOJ H 4 05 I have found it furrounded with pus in an ideot-boy, who was accuftomed to wander about the Leith glafs- houfes. He died with fymptoms of hydrocephalus, and in his ventricles, accordingly, there was found much fluid. Malacarne gives a cafe of its having degene- rated into hydatids, like a duller of grapes. It has not been found upon difledtion in fome cafes> POSTERIOR COMMISSURE;, The bafe of the pineal giand is conne&ed with the polterior commilfure of the brain. This commilfure is feen like a cord, or like the anterior comrtiilfure, towards the back part of the third ventricle, before the tubercula quadrigemina, and above the iter ad quartum ventriculum. Betwixt this commilfure and the bafe of the pineal gland, we have to obferve two or three medullary filaments, not palling from the gland, but lying parallel to the commilfure. But this part of the brain, which appears like a cord, does not deferve the name of commilfure; it does not pafs on each fide into the fubllance of the brain as the anterior one does ; it is loll in the neighbouring border of medullary mat-* ter, and is merely this matter reflected, fo as to have a rounded edge.

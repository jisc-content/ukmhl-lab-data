I 82 OF THE PARTICULAR NERVES. teric artery, it paffes to the left fide of the inteftimim colon and redlumâ€”while the lower mefenteric plexus is continued from the upper one. On the fide of the lumbar vertebras it is continuous with the renal and lpermatic plexus ; and towards the pelvis, with the hy- pogaffcric plexus. Before confidering the other leffer plexus of nerve3 in the abdomen, it is necelfary to follow the continued trunk of the fympathetic nerve which we had defcribed as following clofely the lateral part of the dorfal and lumbar vertebras, whilil the fplanchnic nerves pafs ob- liquely over them to the vifcera of the upper part of the belly. The CONTINUED TRUNK of the SYMPATHETIC nerve, after it has given olf the fplanchnic nerve in the thorax, fends feveral fmall nerves forward over the vertebrae to the mediaftinum and (heath of the aorta. It then paffes the diaphragm, keeping clofe to the tranf- verfe procefs of the vertebras. When, however, it comes lower upon the lumbar vertebras, it lies more upon the fide of their bodies, and the connections with the lumbar nerves are by fmall and numerous twigs which flretch over the fide of the vertebras. In this courfe, it is giving off upon the fore part nume- rous irregular twigs to the feveral plexus. Where it lies under the veffels which pafs to the kidney, it fends up fome branches to the renal plexus. The renal plexus, however, is not entirely formed of thefe branches of the continued fympathetic, but is rather a continuation from the caeliac and' fuperior me- fenteric plexus j while the leffer fplanchnic nerve,, which was fent off in the thorax, alia terminates in it.

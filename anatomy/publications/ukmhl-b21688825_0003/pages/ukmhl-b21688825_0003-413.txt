There is fufpended behind, the facculus, and in contact with the nerve, a fmall triangular bone, which, when pulled away *, is found to hinge upon a delicate cartilage. This bone feems evidently intended, by its being thus fufpended in the neighbourhood of the pulp of the auditory nerve, for imprefling upon that nerve the vibration from the water. The lobfter, then, has, like the amphibious ani- mals, a double provifion for receiving the communi- cation of found alternately from the water or from the air f. The ear of the crab differs from that of the lobfler in this, that, under the projection, there is a moveable cafe of bone, to which we fee a fmall antenna attached. Within this is the organ of hearing ; and there is here an internal provifion for the tranfmiffion of found to the auditory nerve, which confifls fimply in a few circumgyrations of a pellucid and flexible cartilage: an infpiflated fluid furrounds this gyrous cartilage, while the pale auditory nerve is expanded behind it.

Within this cavity there is a facculus diftended with a fluid, and containing a fmall bone J ; on the infide of this bag, (which is called tho facculus lapillorum), a great pro- * See fig. 2. f From the mucous-like tranfparency of the nerve in the lobfler, it is difficult to afcertain its exaft relation to this bone. $ See plate, fig. 3.

54 OF THE veins of the- brain. This finus has in fome rare inftances been found of a fquare fhape; its lower furface ferving as a roof for another finus of a triangular form, which, for fome way, runs parallel with the great finus, and which was of Courfe alfo included in the' lamina of the falxâ€”thefe Malacarne calls feni fubalterni. Irregular lefTer fmufes are by no means uncommon, and they form, fome- times, communications through a great extent of the longitudinal finus ; or again it will be found that the longitudinal finus deviates confiderably, in fome fub- jecls, from the flraight line, taking a curve or circle, generally behind the fontanelle; or it fends off branches, which again unite with it; or it is fairly divided. In all thefe cafes the chords or fafciculi of the dura mater ftretch out over the fmufes, and pro- tect them from compreffion. Inftead of reaching backwards to the crucial line upon the occipital bone, the longitudinal finus has been found to divide at the beginning of the lambdoidaL future, and to follow them in a direction towards the petrous bone * while the lateral fmufes, running in the duplicature of the tentorium, were reduced to a very narrow compafs. , From the flrength of the connections of the fmufes, and from the languid courfe of the blood through them, 1 fcarcely believe that the finus has ever buffered the diflention, which Malacarne defcribes in fome cafes. I ihould rather fuppofe that what he mentions had been natural and congenital enlargements; efpecially con- * Malacarne, part i. 148. fidering

122 THE ORIGIN OF THE NERVES. Thefe two origines of the nerve are connetted by cellu- lar membrane, and have betwixt them a little groove, in which not unfrequently an artery creeps. Accord- ing to Santorini, the anterior of thefe divifions is formed by the tranfverfe fibres of the pons varolii, and the pof- terior by the crura cerebelli. But this nerve appertains truly to the cerebellum ; and Vicq d’Azyr could never, except in one diflection, perceive that any of its fibres arofe from the pons varolii *. The nerve of the right fide has been obferved fometimes larger than that of the left. This fifth nerve, the largeft of the fcull, palling for- wards and downwards, flips in betwixt the lamina of the dura mater, oppofite to the point of the pars petrofum of the temporal bone. It is here firmly attached to the dura mater, and forms a flat irregular plexus. From this plexus there pafs out three great branches:— i ft, One to the focket of the eye and forehead, through the foramen lacerum ; 2d, One to the upper jaw and face, through the foramen rotundum j and 3d, One to the lower jaw and tongue, palling through the fora- men ovale. SIXTH PAIR OF NERVES ; OR, ABDUCENTES f. The fixth nerve of the fcull feems to arife from be- twixt the pons varolii and medulla oblongata. In the origin of its fibres it has, however, much variety ; and authors differ very much in this point of the defcrip- * “ Oritur e nodo cerebri, prope cerebellum duabuspartibus, &c.” Soemmerring. f Or, motores externi. tion.

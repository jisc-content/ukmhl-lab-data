OF THE COATS OF THE EYE. 249 and refills the point of the lancet or fcizzars. This refiflance in the foetus proceeds from a great degree of toughnefs, while, in the adult, the furface of the cornea is fo hard, that I have often feen the point of the knife, in extracting the cataraCl, bend upon it. This turning of the elaflic point of the knife is very- apt to give a wrong direction to the incifion ; and, in- deed, this occurred to me in my firfl operation. There is a pelicle, or exceedingly thin coat, which, by maceration, can be taken off from the furface of the cornea. This is generally underflood to be the conjunftiva continued over it. But I cannot help ex- prefling myfelf as averfe to the ideas of thofe anatomifls who confider every membrane, which can be traced from another by diffection, as either derived from it, or in any way allied to it. This can furely ferve no ufeful purpofe, if, as here, the membranes differ in their ufe ; are changed in their appearance; and have no fimilarity in flruClure, function, or difeafes. The membrane in fifhes, analogous to the adnata, lies loofe over the cornea ; and, in.ferpents, it is thrown off from the cornea, with the fcales of the body, and remains attached to the call Ikin of the head; and in the foetus calf, I have forced the blood in the veffels of the conjundiva into veffels paffing over the furface of the cornea. By maceration, I have found, raifed in the fluid, a very delicate and tranfparent membrane from the inner furface of the cornea; and, after long continued foak- ing, the whole cornea can be taken out of the fclerotic coat, like an opticianâ€™s glafs from its frame.

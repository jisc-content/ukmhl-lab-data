45^ OF THE SENSE OF. SMELLING. the: inflamed, the fecretion is fo altered, that the effluvia do not penetrate fo as to effedt the nerve in its ftate of extreme fenfibility. We have already defcribed the courfe of the firft pair of nerves or the olfactory nerves, and alfo thofe branches of the common nerves which are diftributed to the membrane of the nofe. Thefe, it were fuper- fluous to recapitulate here. It was fuggefled as the moft probable opinion, that the olfactory nerve alone is fubfervient to thefe parts confidered as the organ of fmelling, and that the adventitious branches fupply merely the common fenfibility which the nerves be- llow promifcuoufly over the body. This fenfible and nervous membrane, and this glandular and fecreting membrane, is extremely vafcular, as it is natural a priori to fuppofe ; and this vafcularity, this glandular flru&ure, and its expofed ftate, makes it liable to frequent difeafe: and, when difeafed, when tumors and polypi form in it, we mult never forget the ex- treme thinnefs and delicacy of the furrounding bones, which, when they are either prefled upon by tumors, or have their membranes eroded, are foon totally deflroyed. It is with manifeft defign, that the organ which fo particularly admonifhes us of the effluvia, diffufed in the air we breath, fhould have been placed in the entrance to the canal of the lungs. It is, in fome meafure, a guard to the lungs, as the fenfibility of the tongue guards the alimentary canal. That the humidity of the membrane either preferves the fenfibility of the nofe, or is a folvent, in which the effluvia diflblving affect tip nerves, is evident* for

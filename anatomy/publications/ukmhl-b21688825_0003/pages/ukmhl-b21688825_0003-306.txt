OF THE RETINA. 28 2 proceffes from their adhefion, to the fore part of the retina, we find the retina to form a fac furrounding the vitreous humor, and fupporting the lens. In all this furface, the membrane is fmooth and uninterrupt- ed. To the margin of the lens all this fac is opaque ; becaufe, upon the outfide of the retina, is the opaque pulpy nervous matter, but the coats of the lens are tranfparent, yet continuous with the arachnoid portion of the retina. When thefe parts of the eye are thus diffedted, they hang all together by the optic nerve ; viz. the lens, the vitreous humor, and the expanded matter of the nerve being fupported by delicate and pellucid membranes, conftituting part of the retina ; and the organ, is diverted only of its outer apparatus; we ftill retain within this the more effentia! and important parts, There is here a natural divifion ; and I am willing to paufe upon this, knowing well with how much dif- ficulty the ftudent gains a knowledge of the minute ftrudture of the eye, when point follows upon point of the detail, without any refting-place or mark of divifion and charadter. All within the connexions of the retina, I fhall call the internal globe of the eye, as dirtinguilhing it from the outward coats of the eye and parts fubfervient to them. A view of the little vafcular fyftem of thefe internal parts, thus clafled, will lhow how ftridtly they are connected together, and how much infulated from the other parts. But this is a fubjedt upon which we cannot venture, until we have confidered the nature and relative fitua- lion of the humors of the eye. i DIGRESSION

OF THE PARTICULAR NERVES. 199 As the anterior crural nerve paffes under Paupart’s ligament, it fplits into its numerous branches which fupply the mufcles and integuments on the fore part of the thigh. From the fore part of the nerve there is fent out a mufculo-cutaneous branch, which, while it defcends and fupplies feveral of the mufcles of the thigh, gives out the middle cutaneous nerve. The anterior cutaneous nerve is fent off lower down, but almoft immediately after it has paffed under Paupart’s ligament. The internal cutaneous nerve is fent off from fome of thofe branches which run under the internal articular artery. The laft of the cutaneous branches of the anterior crural nerve, and the moff important, is the nervus saphenus, or cutaneus longus. This is the chief cutaneous nerve of the leg ; but it is to be diftinguilhed as a particular nerve, fo high as under the external articular or circumflex artery, being a divifion of what is called the nervus longus. This nerve is fome- times joined by a branch of the obturator nerve ; and the mufcular branches which it gives off, pafs into the vaftus internus. When we are differing in the courfe of the femoral artery, we have to obferve two nerves running parallel to, and connected with the fheath of the artery. That which is on the infide is the largeft, the courfe of which we Ihall profecute. It follows the artery through the tendon of the triceps mufcle, but it does not defcend into the ham with the popliteal artery. It comes out again through the tendon with the perforating branches of the popliteal artery, or with the upper and internal articular artery. It then becomes a fuperficial nerve, O 4 and

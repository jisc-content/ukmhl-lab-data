402 OF THE HUMAN EAR. je& from it many fmall hairs which fiand acrofs the palfage. Under this fkin there is a fet of fmall glands, which pour their fecretion into the tube, and are called the glandule cerumenosjE *. Thefe glands, fecreting the wax of the ear, have their little duds opening betwixt the roots of the hairs ; and this fecre* tion, with the hairs which (land acrofs the paflage, guards the internal parts of the ear from infe&s. The whole paflage, confiding of the long canal of the tem- poral bone and the cartilaginous tube placed upqn it, has an oblique direction. It firfl; paffes upward and forward, and then makes a flight curve to defcend to the membrane of the tympanum. This external tube of the ear, being of the nature of a fecreting furface, and expofed to the air, is liable to inflammation. There follows a drynefs of the paf- fages, and then a more fluid fecretion. If the inflam- mation of the tube fhould extend within the bones, then, like the affe&ions of all parts furrounded with folid bone, the pain is extreme and the danger con- fiderable : there is not only fuppuration in the tympa- num and deftru&ion of the membrana tympani, but the difeafe may be fhill further communicated internally. Hildanus gives us an obfervation of the effe&s of a ball of glafs dropt by accident into the ear, in which * lt Has figuram obtinent variam: major tamen harum pars vel ft ad ovalem, vel ad fphaericam accedit colore tingbntur flavo ab “ humore in earum folliculis contento qui ob afiiduam fibrarum car- “ nearum reticularium preffionem, per cutis correfpondentia fora- “ mina in meatus auditoiii cavitatem tranfraittitur.” Valfalva de sure humana, p. 10. the

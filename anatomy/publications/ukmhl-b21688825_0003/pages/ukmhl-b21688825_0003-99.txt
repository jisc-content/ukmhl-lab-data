OF THE VENTRICLES OF THE BRAIN. 73 CHAP. III. Â©F THE VENTRICLES AND INTERNAL PARTS OF THE BRAIN. OF THE CAVITIES OF THE BRAIN IN GENERAL. There are within the Brain many tubercles and irregular furfaces, of which it is infinitely more difficult to convey an idea by defcription than of the external parts. Thefe furfaces, as the name im- plies, lie in contact without adhering ; and form what we call, though not perhaps with flrift propriety, the cavities of the brain. Not being feparated, they are fcarcely to be confidered as cavities, although they be capable of diftention by the infiltration of the fluid into them. The furface of the cavities or ventricles of the brain is naturally bedewed with a fluid or hali- tus, which flows from the general furface of the ven- tricle, and from the plexus choroides. This moilture preferves thofe furfaces from adhefion; during life and health it is not accumulated fo as to form a fluid j but in many difeafes, and after death, it is effufed or collected into a fluid. The external convolutions of the brain we have feen to be cineritious on the furfaces: the internal furface of the brain may be confidered alfo

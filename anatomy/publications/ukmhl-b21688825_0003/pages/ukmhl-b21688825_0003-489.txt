OF THE SALIVARY GLANDS. 465 are excited to difcharge their fluids, they become a little ere&ed, their patent mouths are feen diflin&ly, and the tortuous courfe of their canal in the bottom of their mouth may be obferved. The sublingual gland is of a flat and elongated form; it lies clofe under the tongue between the genio* hyo-gloflus and mylo-hyoideus mufcles. It is the fmalleft of the three great falivary glands. The two fublingual glands firetching clofely under the tongue, they are feparated from the mouth only by the mem- brane of the mouth. They have no large du6t, but open by fmall lateral dufls, with loofe pendulous mouths upon the lower furface of the tongue. Befides the lefler glands, which every where are found under the lining membrane of the mouth, Heifter, Verdier, and M. de Bordeu, have defcribed a glandula molaris, feated betwixt the buccinator and mafeter mufcles. From the general furface of the lips, tongue, cheek, and palate, there is a fluid exhaled. This exhaling furface, and all thofe glands, are excited to adlion by the fame ftimulus with the membrane of the mouth. The faliva moiflens the furface of the mouth, aflifls in manducation, and preparing the food to be fwallowed and afled upon by the flomach, and accelerates digef- tion. As the mouth is an exhaling furface, fo is it an imbibing and abforbing furface.

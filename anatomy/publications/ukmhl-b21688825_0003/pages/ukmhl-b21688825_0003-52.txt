This opinion was founded on conjecture, with but a very poor fliew of experiments, viz. by boiling the fub- ftance of the brain in oil, he found it take a granulated appearance, as if. formed of fmall grains, or little glands *. Such was the received opinion until Ruyfch, with a defpotical authority, fwaved the opinions of phyfiolo- gifts: he alleged, in proof only his own experiments and preparations, in which other anatomifts could not follow nor refute him, and therefore they acquiefced. His molt unanfwerable and molt infulting argument was “ veni et videf.” According to Ruyfch, the cortical fubftance of the brain is entirely vafcular, and has no appearance of a glandular or folicular ftru&ure; nay, he conceived it to be entirely compofed of arteries J. But as Mala- carne obferves, though we fuppofe the extremities of * “ Pedamentum, fupra quod pofita eft philia in qua confervatur " portio cerebri in liquore, quam decoxi in oleo olivarum per horas, “ ficuti, facere affolet Dr. Vieuffens.

J Vieuffens was latterly of the fame opinion, and is accufed of plagiarifm by Ruyfch. Accordingly, we find, that in fome parts of his works he deferibes the glands and duds of Malpighi.

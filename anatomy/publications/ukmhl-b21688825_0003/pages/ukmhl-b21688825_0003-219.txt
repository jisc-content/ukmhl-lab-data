OF THE PARTICULAR NERVES* 193 &nd thefe again into four principal branches—to the integuments on the ulnar edge of the hand, and ad- ductor minimi digit!—to the outer edge of the little finger,—to the fide of the little and ring fingers, and a branch which communicates with the radial nerve. Albmus, Monro and Camper differ in regard to the diftribution of nerves to the lumbricales mufcles, which only proves that the twigs palling to thofe little muf- cles are irregular. They come chiefly from the deep branch of the ulnar nerve, whilft others are from the radial nerve. 7. The muscular spiral nerve. We find the external cutaneous nerve, or perforans calferii, pairing* before the arm-bone. The mufcular fpiral nerve palfes behind the bone, and takes a fpiral turn under it to get to the outfide of the arm. It perforates the flefh of the arm betwixt the middle and the Ihort head of the triceps mufcle. Before it perforates the triceps mufcle, the mufcular fpiral fends off branches which pafs over the tendon of the latiffimus dorfi; and be- fore it enters the triceps mufcle, it may be obferved to divide into feveral branches. Three of thefe may be mentioned: a branch to the middle head, and one to the fhort head of the triceps mufcle, and a third and larger nerve which pierces betwixt the mufcles, along with the trunk of the nerve. This laft nerve does not follow the trunk of the nerve in its courfe, but perforating the triceps more dire&ly acrofs, it comes out behind the fupinator longus, where it takes its origin from the os humeri.

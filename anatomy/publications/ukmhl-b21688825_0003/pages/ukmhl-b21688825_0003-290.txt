Zinn deferibes, with much minutenefs, radiated fibres (on the anterior furface of the iris), but does not confider thefe as mufcular fibres ; and he confeffes, that he could not obferve the orbicular mufcle which Maitre-jean and Ruyfch had painted. Even in owls and other creatures, having a flrong iris, he could not difeover an orbicular mufcle; nor were Haller and Morgagni more fuccefsful in this invefti- ga'cion *. Wrifberg alfo affirms, that no mufcular fibres could be feen in the iris of the ox. Dr. Monro, on the other hand, adheres to the opinion of the mufeu- larity of the iris: he deferibes minutely both the radi- ated and fphinCter fibres. Wrifberg and others have thought they found fufficient proof againft the mufeu- larity of the iris, in the fact of its not contracting when the light falls upon its furface. To this Dr. Monro anfwers, that the colour or paint upon the iris mult, like a cuticle, prevent the light from irritating the iris. I cannot think that this circumftance fhould prevent the excitement of the iris. The retina is in a peculiar manner fufceptible of the impreffion of light; but we cannot wonder that light fhould not ftimulate a mufcle to contraction, when we have every proof that it has no effeCt on the rnoft delicate expanded nerve of the other fenfes. That the iris is to be affeCted only through the fen- fation of the retina, or perhaps rather the effeCt com- municated to the fenforium, we have fufficient proof. * See Zinn, p. 89 and 90. Morgagni.

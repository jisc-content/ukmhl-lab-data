146 OF THE PARTICULAR NERVES. facial nerves, and the laft enumerated of the intricate branches of the fifth pair. the sixth pair of nerves ; aeducentes, or MOTORES EXTERNI. The fixth pair of nerves, as we have feen, arifes be- twixt the tuber annulare and the corpus pyramidale. Advancing forwards and upwards, fometimes above and fometimes beneath the branches of the bafilar ar- tery, it penetrates the dura mater by the fide of the bafilar finufes. It then paffes by the fide of the carotid artery, and through the cavernous finus. Here it gives off filaments, which, clinging to the carotid artery, de- feend with it until they are joined by a branch of the vidian nerve. Thefe together form the origin of the great fympathetic nerve. It is a difputed point, how- ever, whether this be a branch given out from, or re- ceived into, the fixth pair ; and in the defeription of the fixth pair, we might fay, that as it paffes the caro- tid artery, it receives one or more nerves which come up through the carotid hole, and encircle the nerve. The fixth pair enters the orbit by the foramen lacerum, with the third and fourth pairs, and firft branch of the fifth. It pierces the abduftor mufcle of the eye before it is finally diflributed to its fubftance. It has been prefumed, that the fixth nerve does not give off the fympathetic nerve, but receives thofe branches from it, becaufe the fixth nerve is larger be- twixt this point and its diflribution in the orbit, than betwixt the fame point and its origin from the brain. But I conceive, that this enlargement of the fixth pair is

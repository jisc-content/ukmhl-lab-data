The fafciculus, which, proceeding from the medulla oblongata, pafles out of the cranium by the fide of the great lateral dnus, and which, in the view we have of the nerves upon raidng the brain from the cranium,Is properly enough confidered as the eighth pair, condds in truth of three didinfl nerves. Thefe are the glosso PHARYNGEAL NERVE, the PAR VAGUM, and the SPINAL ACCESSORY NERVE of WlLLIS. The glosso-pharyngeal nerve. This nerve, parting from its connexion with the par vagum and acceflory nerves, perforates the dura mater feparately from thefe, and in many fubje&s, pafles through an ofleous canal diflinft from the par vagum. When it efcapes from the cranium, it lies deep under the angle of the jaw, and pafles acrofs the internal caro- tid artery upon its outer fide. It is to be feen by lift- ing the dyloid mufcles, at which point it fends fmall branches to the dyloid and digadric mufcles, and to join the par vagum. It fends alfo fome very fmall twigs down upon the internal carotid artery; fome of which join that pharyngeal branch* which is formed from the par vagum and acceflory nerve, * This is a branch to the pharynx which is formed by the par vagum and the fpinal acceflory'of Willis. After this nerve is formed, it again forms connexion with the par vagum.â€”Pain in the throat having been obferved by Galen to extend to the back, Scarpa ex- plains it on the ground of this connexion with the fpinal acceflory nerve. 4 Thefe

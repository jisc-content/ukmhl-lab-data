I 268 OF THE IRIS, vances, it fills a greater fpace in the fphere of vifion, and of courfe more rays flow from it into the eye. Nerves of the iris. The iris is fupplied with nerves in great profufion. They are derived from the long ciliary nerves which run forward betwixt the cornea and choroid coat towards the common root of ^hfiveorona ciliaris and the iris, They there divide, and are feen to pafs in numerous branches into the fubftance of the iris. In the fubftance of the iris, the branches of the nerves, from their extreme minutenefs, are foon loft amongfl: its pale fibres. Blood vessels of the iris, I have had prepa? rations which (bowed fo great a degree of vafcularity in the iris,, that I was ready to believe its aftion to be produced entirely by a vafcular (trudlure ; but when, on other occafions, my admiration was excited by the profufion of nerves, and I was led to obferve that in the former inftances they had been obfcured by the in- jection, I could not but allow that the mufcular fibres might have been obfcured as the nerves were. There are four arteries fent to the iris : two long ciliary arteries which take a long courfe on the outfide of the choroid coat, and two lefier and anterior arteries which pierce the ligamentum ciliare from without. Thefe arteries approach the root of the iris at four op- pofite points, and branching widely form a vafcular circle round the root of the iris, viz. the larger circle of the iris. From this circle branches pafs off", which run with a ferpentine courfe, converging to the edge of the iris : here they again throw out inofculating branches, which form a circle furrounding the pupil, but at fome little

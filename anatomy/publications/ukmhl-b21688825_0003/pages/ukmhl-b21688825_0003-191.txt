OF THE PARTICULAR NERVES. 165 The M3 proceed to the fmall mufcles, moving the head and lying on the fore part of the fpine. The pojlcrior branch of the fecond pair of cervical nerves is chiefly a mufcular nerve. It rifes up by the fide of the com- plexus, gives branches to that mufcle and to the fple- nius, and communicates with the branches of the firil cervical. Its branches are alfo diftributed to the upper part of the trapezius mufcle, from which they extend along the integuments, covering the occiput even to the fummit of the head. The third cervical nerve, in the firft place, communicates with the fecond and fourth cervical nerves, with the fympathetic and lingual nerves, and fometimes fends down a twig to unite with the origine of the phrenic nerve from the fourth cervical nerve. From the anterior divifion of the third cervical nerve, branches pafs to the fplenius and complexus, and trapezius, and upwards to the ear. We may ob- ferve alfo a cutaneous nerve which accompanies the external jugular vein, viz. nervus superficialis coli ; the diftribution of which is chiefly to the angle and margine of the lower jaw, while fome of its branches enter the parotid gland, and unite with the extremities of the portio dura and other facial nerves. The small posterior division of the nerve paflfes to the complexus, fpinalis cervicis, and multifidus fpina, while at the fame time it unites to the branches of the fecond cervical nerve. The fourth cervical nerve, coming out from betwixt the third and fourth cervical vertebra, divides into its anterior and pofterior branches like the other cervical nerves.

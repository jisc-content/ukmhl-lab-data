OF THE HUMAN EAR. 433 Where this canal of the portio dura advances towards the furface of the pars petrofa, it is joined by a very fmall canal which extends from the videan hole on the fore part of the inclining face of the bone : again, after it has palled the tympanum, it is joined by a Ihort canal which receives the corda tympani, after it has palled the tympanum. The other foramen which is in the upper and idler fovea of the meatus internus, is rather a cribriform plate, as it is a deep pit with many foramina in it. Thefe lead into the vellibule, and form the macula cribrosa vestibuli *. In the inferior and larger fovea, we obferve feveral dark fpots, which, when more narrowly examined, are alfo diltinguilhed to be cribriform plates, or colledions of Idler foramina. We particularly obferve that conical cavity which is per- forated with many little pores for tranfmitting the nerve into the cochlea, and which we have already mentioned. From the form which thefe foramina take, this is named the tractus spiralis foraminolosus. Thefe foramina, after palling along the modiolus cochr leas, turn at right angles, and pafs betwixt the plates of the lamina fpiralis. Befides the tractus fpiralis foraminolofus, the bottom of the larger fovea has many irregular foramina, which are like cancelli: for very delicate fpeculse of bone Hand acrofs fome of them. There is a range of thefe foramina which ftretches from the tradus fpiralis. This may properly be called the tractus calthra- * See Scarpa, Plate VII., fig. i, m. TUS

405 OF THE HUMAN EAR. inner extremity of the meatus externus forms a circle which is pretty regular, and upon which the mem- brane of the tympanum is extended. That part of the cavity of the tympanum which is oppofite to the ter- mination of the meatus externus, is very irregular. It has in it the foramen rotundum and the foramen ovale; and betwixt thefe, there is an irregular boney tuberofity from which there ftretch back fome exceed- ingly fmall fpiculse of bone, which connect themfelves with the margin of the irregular cavity of the mafloid procefs. The foramen ovale * is in the bottom of a deep finus; it is not ftriCtly of an oval form, but has its lower fide ftraight, while the upper margin has the oval curve. This opening leads into the veftibule or central cavity of the labyrinth. The foramen rotundum is more irregular than the oval hole. It does not look direCtly forward, like it, but enters on the fide of an irregular projection : it does not lead into the veftibule, but into one of the fcalse of the cochlea. In the recent ftate of the parts, the periofteum covering the furface of the cavity of the tympanum, takes away much of its irregularity. Where the tympanum leads backward into the cellule mastoidea, this periofteum is alfo continued. The eustachean tube! extends forward from the cavity of the tympanum, and opens behind the palate {. In the dry bones, the euftachean tube is * Feneftra ovalis. f Iter a palato ad aurem. t By fome older writers, the euftachean tube is called aquedudf, becaufe they conceived that tumors were evacuated from the tym- panum by this paflage.

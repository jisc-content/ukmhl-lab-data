6 INTRODUCTORY VIEW, &C. tion of the blood. We ihould be tempted to imagine, that the nervous fyftem were a nobler part of the eco* nomy, did we not frequently fee the powers of the mind as well as the fundtions of the nerves difturbed, or- altogether overthrown by the irregularities of the bo- dily fyftem; were we not thus reminded of that circle, of conne&ions and mutual dependences which fupport the whole. If the tide of blood flow too rapidly upon, the brain, the intelledl is difordered, the ideas come in rapid and irregular fucceflion. If the exit of the blood from the head be obftrufted, there is an obftru&ion to the circulation of the blood in the extremities of the veflels of the brain ; the function of the brain is fud- denly fupprefled, becaufe, though its attributes feem fo peculiar, it requires the perpetual circulation of the blood through it to renovate its powers. The effeft of the circulation of the blood through the nerves of the limb is not lefs remarkable. If the nerve of a limb be cut or tied, the animal can no longer move the limb, having loft the power of the will over It. But if the great artery of a limb be tied, the function of the nerve is, in a fhort time, equally de- ftroyed, becaufe the circulation of the blood through the nerve being obftructed, it lofes its powers, and is no longer a living part. Thus, whilft the moving powers of the circulation of the blood are dependent on the ftate of the nervous fyftem, the nervous fyftem is as immediately dependent on the healthy ftate of the blood, and the velocity o( the circulation. With this general view of our fubjeft, we proceed ta inveftigate the anatomy of the brain as a diftindt part^ without forgetting the unity of the fyftem.

OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. 3 embryo the nerves are laid in their fheaths, extending to the remoteft parts of the body. They are connected with the brain, and in this fenfe they may be confidered as elongations of it, the perfect fundtion of both de- pending upon their union. But they have powers in- dependently of the brain ; and often an animal fs pro- duced having no brain; and yet, in fuch embryo, the animal fundtions are fufficiently. perfedt. In the fame manner, when the trunk of the nerve of a limb is cut, it is only deprived of its connedtion with the brain, the centre of the nervous fyftem; and little further effedt is produced than the deftrudtion of the powers of the will over the limb; the nutrition and growth of the part continue, and the adfion of thofe parts, which are independent of the will, as the muf- cular power of the velfels of the limb, remains entire. The nerves of animals are in proportion to the fize of their bodies; but in many of the great tribes of ani- mals the brain bears no fuch proportion. The nerves of the organs alfo bear a relation to the neceffities of the animal, not to the fize of the brain. If the procuring of fuftenance depend upon the power of the organ of fmeliing, or upon the ear, or the eye, or even the bill, an additional fupply of nerves is provided, or a pe- culiar apparatus of nerves fuiting to the exigency. This alfo fhews a property in the nerves independent of the brain. x We come to this conclufion, that the nerves are ana- logous to the brain, (being indeed a matter fimilar in Itrudture and fundtion to it,) dilfufed ever the body, and included like it in the pia mater, or in a fimilar delicate and vafcular membrane, and that their proper B 2 fubftance.

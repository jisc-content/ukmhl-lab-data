OF THE EYE* 229 convex furface, they are not made to converge upon the central line, but diverge from it. Farther, the rays of the fun when palling from a me- dium of'glafs into the air, are turned,by refraction, farther off from the central line to which they were drawn in entering the convex furface of glafs. But if the rays, in palling through the glafs, were in a direction con- verging to the perpendicular line, they will be made to converge dill farther, as is feen here in fig. 3. rig.3. .!- Jfi 4 . If, however, the rays be made to pafs .from glafs into the air, and the furface of the glafs be concave as in fig. 4., the rays will be made to have a lefs degree of convergence, fo as to remove the image * farther from the furface of the glafs. But if the rays palling through the medium of glafs have no convergence, but pafs in parallel lines, they will diverge as the lines a a, fig. 4. do, when they emerge from the concave furface of the glafs.

OF THE MEMBRANES OF THE BRAIN. ency of this matter alfo varies confiderably in different parts; it is foft in the bafe of the brain, betwixt the optic nerves and anterior commiflure, and in the third ventricle. The medullary matter is chiefly in the in- ternal part of the brain, forming a hind of nucleus or white central part; but in many parts of the brain, there is a mixture of thefe which fc n flrias*; and in fome of the eminences, the internal part is cineritious, while the external part, or what we might here call the cortical part, is medullary f. The cortical or cineritious fubflance does not blend gradually with the white medullary matter, but on the contrary, their line of diftindlion is abrupt: an inter- vening fubflance has been obferved. In inflammation of the brain, particularly, it has been faid, that this third fubflance has been found. This may be merely the effetl of light upon the union of the two fubflances. We, however, often obferve an appearance of fucceflive coloured circles upon the edge of the medullary matter of the arbor vitas, in the cerebellum. “ hsemorrbagia mortuorum.

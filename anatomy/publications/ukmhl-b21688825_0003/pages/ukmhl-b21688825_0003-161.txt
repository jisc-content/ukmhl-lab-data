OF THE PARTICULAR NERVES. I35 lunar, or Gaflerian ganglion. This ganglion lies on the anterior point of the temporal, and on the fphenoidal bone. In their paffage from the brain, the filaments, compofing the fifth nerve, are loofe, or eafilv fepa- rated; at this place, they are all found fo fubdivided and entangled, as to refill further divifion. The nerve here fvvells out into a greater fize; it feems to be in- corporated with the denfe fibres of the dura mater; it becomes of a dark red, or mixed colour; all which circumflances have, by no means, been unobferved by anatomifts. Vieuflens fuppoled, that the ufe of this ganglion, of the fifth pair, before it perforates the cra- nium, was to flrengthen the nerve, and enable it to withfland the motion of the jaws! But it would rather feem to be a ganglion connecting in fympathy all thofe parts to which the nerve is finally diflributed *. The connexion of the Gaflerian ganglion with the dura mater, is fo firm, that it yet remains undecided, whether there are fent off here any nerves to that membrane; but I conceive, that there are none, and that the connection of the ganglion with the fibrous membrane, or fheath which covers it, has been mis- taken for nerves palling from the ganglion to the dura mater. From the femilunar or Gaflerian ganglion, the fifth nerve divides into three great branches; whence the name of trigemini: lit, ihe OPTHALMIC BRANCH of WILLIS, which pafies through the foramen lacerum into the orbit, * “ Et affe&um animi indicia in faciei partibusdepingereadjuvet.” Hirfch.

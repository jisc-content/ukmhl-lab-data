OF THE EYE. which R 2 for, although we are neceffarily led to confider the na- ture of the fubflance of the retina, the manner in which it is expanded, and fupported by adhefion, and nourifhed by veffels, we muft not venture far in the attempt to inveftigate the manner of its receiving or conveying the image of objeds to the fenforium. We muft turn to inveftigate the more ufeful fubject of the ftrudure, ufe, and difeafes * of the humors and coats of the eye. It is the firft principle of the conftitution of the eye, that the rays of light muft be fo concentrated as to impinge ftrongly on the expanded nerve or retina in the bottom of the eye. Now, as we have feen, that a lens (which is a double convex glafs) is neceffary, fo to concentrate the rays of light proceeding from an objed, as to form a fmall and lively image of it, (as in marginal plate, fig. 5.), fo, in the fame manner, an effential part of the eye is the lens, which brings the rays of light to a focus; and that the lens may make the rays proceeding from an object converge into an accurate focus, fo as to form a diftind image on the eye, the vitrious humor is interpofed betwixt the lens and the furface of the retina : again, it is neceffary to the conftitution of the eye, that, in order to encreafe the fphere of vifton, the anterior part cf it fhall projed and form a large fegment of a fmall circle, fo as to take a greater circumference into the fphere of vifton than could have been, done, had the larger fphere of the eye-ball been continued on the fore part. Another neceffary part of the apparatus of the eye is the iris, * Of the difeafes only as they relate,to the explanation of the ftrudlure and oeconomy of the eye.

We learn from Mr. Homef, that Mr. John Hunter had proved the lens to be laminated, and thofe lamir.se to be compofed of fibres; and, upon the fame authority, we learn that his opinion was in favour of the mufcu- larity of its flru&ure. Mr. Home wifhed to follow out this fubjeCt, by including it in the Croonian Lec- ture. Mr. Home found, with the afhfiance of Mr. Ramfden, that a patient, after the extraction of the cataraCl, flill retained the power of adapting the eye to the diflances of objefts. Indeed, we muff be v/ell aware that if a patient, after couching and extracting the lens, could only fee at one given diftance, an effect fo' very particular muff have been long fince ohferved. This was a conviction to Mr. Home and Mr. Ramfden, that the invefligation was to be no further purfued in this trad, and they turned their attention, therefore, to the cornea. . Mr. Ramfden contrived an apparatus which, if the gentlemen engaged in the experiments have not de- ceived themfelves, muff put this queftioh at reft. Ey Mr. Ramfden’s ingenious contrivance, the head was fixed accurately, and at the fame time a microfcope was adapted to obferve the changes in the convexity of the cornea as the eye was direCled alternately to i * See Philof, TranC A a i f Ibid. near

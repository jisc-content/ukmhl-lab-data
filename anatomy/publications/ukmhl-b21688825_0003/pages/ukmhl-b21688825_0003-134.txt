Io8 OF THE VENTRICLES OF THE BRAIN. lhape and relation to the other parts. Varolius, looking upon thofe parts inverted, compares the crura cerebri to a river palling under a bridge, and thence named it Pons. The nodus cerebri, again, is a name well applied, fince this medullary emminence has much the appear- ance of a knot call upon the medullary proceffes of the cerebrum, and is in faÂ£t the central union of the elon- gated medullary matter of both cerebrum and cerebel- lum. On the furface of this medullary protuberance there are many tranfverfe fibres, which, uniting in a middle line, form a kind of rapha, which, upon a fuperficial fe&ion, {hows a longitudinal medullary line. The fibres upon the furface of this body are uniform and parallel to each other in the moll; proje&ing part; but upon the fides, they difperfe to give place to the fifth pair of nerves and crura cerebelli. A deeper incision of the pons varolii, while it {hows the intimate union of the crura cerebri, cerebelli, and pons varolii, alfo {hows the white medullary tradls which extend from the crura cerebri through the pons varolii to the corpora pyramidalia; part of thefe pafs through the locus niger crurum cerebri, and can be traced to the corpora ftriata. We fee alfo the tranf- verfe fibres of the medullary and cineritious fubftance, which make a right angle with thofe longitudinal tracts. MEDULLA

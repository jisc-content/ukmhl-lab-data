442 OF HEARING IN GENERAL. comes a queftion, whether the ofcillations of found pafs by one or by both of thefe foramina ? It is the opinion of many, that while the chain of bones receives the motion of the membrane of the tympanum, the motion of this membrane at the fame time caufes a vibration of the air in the tympanum which reaches the foramen rotundum, and thus conveys a double motion through the cochlea. In the labyrinth there is no air, but only an aqueous fluid : now this, we have feen, conveys a ftronger impulfe than the atmofphere; ftronger in pro- portion to its greater fpecific gravity and want of elaiticity; for an elaftic fluid like air may be com- prefled by concuflion, but an inelaftic fluid mull tranf- mit fairly every degree of motion it receives. But if the fluid of the labyrinth be furrounded on all fides; if, as is really the cafe, there can be no free fpace in the labyrinth, it can partake of no motion, and is ill fuited to receive the ofcillations of found. Againfl: this perfect inertia of the fluids of the labyrinth I con- ceive the foramen rotundum to be a provifion. It has a membrane fpread over it, fimilar to that which clofes the foramen ovale. As the foramen ovale re- ceives the vibrations from the bones of the tympanum, they circulate through the intricate windings of the labyrinth, and are again tranfmitted to the air in the tympanum by the foramen rotundum. Without fuch an opening there could be no circulation of the vibra- tion in the labyrinth ; no motion of the fluids com- municated through the contiguous facculi, nor through the fcalas of the cochlea; becaufe there would be an abfolute

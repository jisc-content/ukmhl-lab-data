11 8 THE ORIGIN OF THE NERVES. Valverda, a phyfician of Spain, who travelled into Italy, and ftudied the Works of Vefalius and Human Dilfeftion, fays, that at Venice he had frequent oppor- tunities of alluring himfelf that there was no deculfation ; for robbers were punifhed for the firfi: offence by lofing one of their eyes ; and for the fecond by death. Rio- linus, Rolefinkius, and Santorini, give obfervations of the nerve of the injured eye being fmall and Ihrivelled, and of their having traced them pall; their union to the fame fide of the brain with the eye to which they be- longed.

Zin alfo agrees with the opinion of Galen, that there is an adhefion and intimate union of fubftance, but no eroding of the nerves. Soemmerring deems it fufficient to point out the authorities on both Tides of the queltion, while he has no decided opinion whether there be a perfect de- culfation or not *. Porterfield, while he allows the in- timate union of the optic nerves, has feveral obferva- tions, proving that they have no interfeftion or decuf- fation.

He dif- credits the accounts of their having been traced to the fame fide of the brain, and believes the alfertions to be the confequence of previous opinion and prejudice.— There are certain obfervations of Valfalva, Chefelden, and Petit, which feem to prove, that where the brain is * “ Ergo, utrum omnes nervorum fibrae, an quasdam tantum mu- “ tuo fe fecent, certe ftatui nequit.” injured

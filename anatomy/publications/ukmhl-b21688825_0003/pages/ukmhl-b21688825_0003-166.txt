I40 OF THE PARTICULAR NERVES. infra orbital; 2d, The defcending branch, which again gives off the vidian and nafal nerves; 3d, The palatine nerve and pofterior alveolar nerve. It was; not till afterwards that he difcovered the ganglion which takes his name; and, of courfe, the previous de- fcription muft be imperfect. The fuperior maxillary- nerve, after fending off the fmall branches which I have defcribed to enter the orbit, having fairly emerged out of the cranium, fends down two fmall branches which, uniting, form a little ganglion of a redifli colour, and of a triangular Ihape, like a heart. This, the spheno-palatine ganglion, or ganglion of Miekcl, is exaftly oppoftte to the fpheno-palatine hole ; and thcfe nerves, and this ganglion are immerfed in the foft fat which fills up the fpace betwixt the fphenoid palatine and fuperior maxillary bones. From this ganglion are fent out feveral lefler nerves,â€™ and particularly the nafal, vidian, and palatine nerves. The superior nasal branches pafs by the fpheno-palatine hole to the membrane on the back part of the nofe, and to the cells of the fphenoid bone, through the fpheno-palatine hole. The vidian nerve comes off from the back part of the ganglion, and paftes into the foramen pteri- goideum backwards. It firft gives off forne fmall branches to the nofe (the fuperior and pofterior nafal nerves of Miekel) ; thefe perforating the bone laterally, are diftributed on the pituitary membrane, covering the vomer. The vidian nerve continuing its courfe backwards, fplits; one branch, after a long retrograde courfe through the petrous part of the temporal bone, forms a connexion with the portio dura, while the other

*22 OF THE SENSES. Its flow and equable pulfation ; the breathing becomes flower; and the wafted ftrength of the fyftem is re- cruited. We may define fleep to be a ft ate in which the fen- fations are dull, the voluntary mufcles inert, and the vital motions calm and regular. In dreaming, the fen- fations are dull and obfeure, but the imagination more alive and active; unnatural fleep, or foporific difeafes, may be characterized by the difordered imagination, and difturbed vital and voluntary motions. The vital aCtions, which are calm, flow, and equable, during natural fleep, become opprefled; the fenfibility, which is gradually diminilhed upon the approach of fleep, but always capable of being roufed by the fenfes, be- comes quite opprefled ; the voluntary mufcles continue relaxed, as in fleep, or convulfed by irregular motions. In apoplectic difeafes, the functions of the yifcera pro- ceed, and are but partially impeded ; but when the circulation of the blood and play of the lungs are ob- ftruCted, the operations of the mind are not equally unconcerned in the paroxyfm; for in fyncope, the fudden depletion of the blood veflels of the brain caufes inftant lofs of fenfe and of voluntary motion. If natural fleep is not profound, the imagination is awake ; but there may be falfe perceptions, falfe judg- ment and aflociations, and difproportionate emotions ; and if fenfations are perceived, they do not produce the ordinary aflociations. If fuch a ftate of the intellectual functions occurs during the waking ftate, it becomes delirium. That this delirium is analogous to the per- turbed ftate of the imagination during fleep, appears from the delirium in fevers uniformly fliowing its ap- proach

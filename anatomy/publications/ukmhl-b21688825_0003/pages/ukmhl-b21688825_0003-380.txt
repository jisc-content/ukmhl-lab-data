We have feen, that there is a point in both retinas more acutely fenfible to the impreffion of light and the image of objedts, than any other part of all its concavd furface. In a found eye, this point is immediately op- fite to the pupil. There is a coincidence betwixt this point and the axis of the eye; and wheft We look to an objedt, its image ftrikes this point of the retina : but if it fhould happen that this fenfible point of the retina fhould be changed, and not be exadfly oppofite to the pupil when the axis of the eye is in the line with the object, there will be an effort of the mufcles moving the eye-ball to turn, fo that the rays proceed- ing from the objedt fhall flrike upon the more fenfible fpot of the nerve *. Again, if the greater fenfibility of the nerve fhould lie in its proper place, and a re- mote caufe fhould occafion fuch an adtion of the mufcles and diflortion of the eye as we fee in a fquint, then the image will be double; for it no longer fall on correfponding points of the retina of each eye, and fejparate images are conveyed to the brain. If, how- ever, this diflortion continues, the fingle vifion is * This was M. de la Hire’s opinion.—He had an idea alfo that fquinting was produced by the obliquity of the objedt.

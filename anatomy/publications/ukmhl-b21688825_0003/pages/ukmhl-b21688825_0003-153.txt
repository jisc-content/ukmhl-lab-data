I27 THE ORIGIN OF THE NERVES. ments; thofe unite into a fafciculus of a pyramidal fhape: dill thofe filaments do not form a nerve before per- forating the dura mater, but pierce it feverally * ; they then unite and pafs out of the fcull by the condoloyd foramen of the occipital bone ; they are then connected with the eighth pair and ganglion of the fympathetic -nerve.—The final diflribution of the nerve, is to the mufcles of the tongue f. the Tenth, or suboccipital nerve, From its origin, its manner of pafiing betwixt the fcull and firft vertebras, and its diftribution, it mult be claffed with the nerves of the fpine. The nerves of the fpine are divided into the eight cervical, twelve dorfal, five lumbar, five, and fometimes fix or feven, facral nerves J. Each of thofe twenty-five nerves arifes in two fafciculi, one from the fore, and the other from the back part of the fpinal marrow. They are to be traced a great way in the length of the fpinal marrow before they pafs the membranes. The pofte- rior and anterior fafciculi penetrate the dura mater fepa- rately, and afterwards unite. The pofierior fafciculi of * The ninth pair of nerves often differ very much in one fide from the other, in regard to the origin and number of thofe fafciculi. f “ Forfan etiam nimio fhnguine plena arteria vertebrali prefTus “ lseditur, ut inde haefttantia atque refolutio linguae ebriorum, ex ce- “ rebri phlegmone infanientium, attonitorum explicari poffit.—Col- “ lapfa vero eadem arteria ex nimio fanguinis profluvio lingua ob “ fanguinis forfan defectum refolvitur.—-Ex ejufdem nervi nexu “ cum nervis cervicalibus vccis ja&uram poll laefam fpinalis medul- “ Is partem quae in cervice eft, explicarunt.” % “ Plerumque quinque funt, nonnunquam fex, raro tres vel qua- *( tttor.” Soemmerring. the

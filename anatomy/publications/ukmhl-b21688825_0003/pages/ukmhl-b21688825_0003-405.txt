OF THE EARS OF ANIMALS. 381 For example, in rhe .crab and lobster, we find a prominent bony papilla or Ihell, which is perforated with a membrane extended acrofs the perforation, and % behind this membrane there is a fluid, in which the nerve is expanded, and which receives the impulfe con- veyed to the membrane. In the cuttle-fish, again, there is no external opening; there is merely a little fac under the thick integuments : this fac has in it a fmall concretion or bone for receiving the vibration ; which, in this animal, is conveyed by a more general impreflion upon the head than in thofe lad mentioned; and the vibration of this loofely poifed bone or con- crete feems equal to the provifion of the membrane which, in the crab, clofes up the external opening in the perforated fhell. In fishes, there is a confiderable, variety of druc- ture. Thofe which remain perpetually under water, have not the outer membrane, nor any apparatus for drengthening the fird-received undulations of found. But fuch as lie balking on the furface of the water, and breathe through lungs, have an external openfngâ€”a canal leading to the membrane, and behind the mem- brane bones to convey the vibration to the internal parts, and thefe internal parts, the feat of the fenfe, are actually as perfect as in terredrial animals. In neither of the fpecies of fifties, the cartilaginous nor fpinous fifties, is there a proper external opening, as in animals breathing air. They receive the impulfe from the water, upon the integuments and bones of the head ; but within the head, and in the feat of the fenfe, they have a mod beautiful apparatus for receiving and conveying

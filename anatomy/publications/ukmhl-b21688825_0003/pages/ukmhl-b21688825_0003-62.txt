42 OF THE VEINS OF THE BRAIN. the ficial veins of the furface of the hemifpheres, are in number generally from ten to fifteen on each fide. They really do not feem to be worthy of the minute attention which Vicq d’Azyr has bellowed upon them; he has moll carefully defcribed each indi- vidual branch, and that not in general terms, but firlt thofe of the right, and then thofe of the left fide. Now, although thefe veins do not enter the finus oppofed to each other, nor in pairs, Hill the irregularity is tri- fling, and were it important, does not admit of defcrip- tion. Thofe veins do not lie in the fulci of the brain, but pafs occafionally along the interltices, or over the convolutions of the brain; they take in general a courfe from before backwards, but previous to their entering the finus, are turned forwards. We have already ob- ferved, that the pia mater and dura mater have no con- nection, but at the place where thofe veins enter the lamina of the dura mater; and here their connexion is fomewhat peculiar. It is not a fimple adhefion of the pia mater and dura mater; but a white fpongy fub- ftance feems to conned and llrengthen them, and, when torn afunder, it leaves a foft fatty kind of rough- nefs upon the pia mater. Thefe appear to me to be der. Sabbatier fays decidedly, that they enter with their mouths oppofed to the courfe of the blood in the finus. From Malacarne, we fnould be led to conceive (what I believe to be the truth) that they open very irregularly. “ Non tutte quelle vene fboccano ob- “ liquamente ad un modo nel feno, come non a tutte la membrana “ interna del medelimo fomminiftra quella valvuletta, che pure a mo* “ di lingua, di briglia, di mezza luna frequentementc ne ottura la “ met'a, il terzo, o minor parte degli orihci.” Malacarne, p. 94.

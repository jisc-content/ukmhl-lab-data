The ifchiatic nerve is formed by the two laft nerves of the loins, and the three firft of the facrum: or we may defcribe its origin more particularly thus; the an- tenor branch of the fourth lumbar nerve and the trunk of the fifth uniting, form a ftrong cord of about two inches in length ; this root is joined to another nearly as large, formed by the .firft and fecond facral nerves; and again, a third divifion joins it from the inferior branch of the fecond facral nerve and from the third *. The ifchiatic nerve is thus formed of three great roots matted together into a kind of plexus, and then paffes betwixt the pyriformis mufcle and the gemini, and thus efcapes from the back part of the pelvis by the great ifchiatic notch. But before following this great nerve into the thigh, we muft take notice of many leffer nerves fent out from the facral nerves, and from the trunk of the ifchiatic nerve. Thefe nerves pafs to the mufcles and integu- ments of the nates and back of the thigh to the peri- neum and private parts. of the lesser nerves which go out from the BACK PART OF THE PELVIS. ift.

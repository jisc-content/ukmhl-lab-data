OF THE PARTICULAR NERVES* 189 pafs off branches from the axillary plexus to the great and little pe&oral mufcles, to the latiffimus dorfi, to the (kin and mamma. Thefe thoracic branches pro- ceed from the upper divifion of the plexus, or that which gives out the external cutaneous, and one of the roots of the radial nerve. 2. 'The suprascapular nerve comes off from the upper edge of the plexus, and is the higheft of the branches. It runs towards the root of the coracoid procefs, it paffes through the notch of the fcapula, and goes to fupply the fupra and infra fpinatus mufcles, the teres minor, and the fubfcapularis. The subscapular nerves come out from the pofterior part of the plexus along with the articular nerve. They are attached to the fubfcapular mufcle, they turn round the flefhy edge of the mufcle, and in- fmuate their branches betwixt the tendon of the latif- fimus dorfi and the teres major, 3. The circumflex, or articular nerve, or axillaris, lies very deep. It comes from the back part of the plexus, paffes behind the neck of the humerus, and above the tendon of the latiffimus dorfi, and teres major. One of its branches we trace into the teres major, while another paffes round the bone, and is dis- tributed to the under furface of the deltoid mufcle, the joint, and the cellular membrane. 4. Perforans casserii, or the external cu- taneous nerve. This nerve paffes through the co- raco-brachialis mufcle before the os humeri, to gain the outfide of the arm. From its perforating this mufcle, and being defcribed by Cafferius, it is called the nervus perforans Ca fierii. Before paffing through 4 the

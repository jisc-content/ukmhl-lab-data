OF THE PARTICULAR NERVES. 175 the neck; one of which forms the middle, and the other the lower ganglion. There are received by the middle cervical gang- lion, or, thyroid ganglion, branches of nerves from the third, fourth, fifth, and fixth cervical nerves, and alfo fometimes from the phrenic nerve. The gang- lion is by no means conftantly found, and it is irre- gular in its fize and Ihape. When large, and in what may be confidered as its more perfect ftate, it gives off fome confiderable branches. Of thefe, part unite with the fuperior cardiac nerve already mentioned; others form the great or deep cardiac nerve, while lelfer ones play round the fubclavian artery, and unite with the lower cervical ganglion, or the upper thoracic ganglion. The deeper cardiac branch of the fympathetic, fplit- ting and again uniting fo as to form rings, runs out- wards, attached to the arteria innominata and arch of the aorta, to the heart. In this courfe, while it paffes before the trachea, it forms conne&ions with the re- current branch and trunk of the par vagum. Under the arch of the aorta, we find this branch concentrated to form the ganglion cardiacum of Wrilberg, or ganglion molle and pellucidum of Scarpa. This ganglion is like a mere enlargement or fwelling of the nerve. From this, four or five branches may be enu- merated ; ill, A bi'anch palling behind the pulmonary artery to the back of the heart, and following the left coronary artery; 2dly, A fmall divifion to the ante- rior pulmonary plexus of the par vagum; 3dly, A pretty confiderable branch which, palling behind the aorta, and betwixt it and the pulmonary artery, is dif- tributed

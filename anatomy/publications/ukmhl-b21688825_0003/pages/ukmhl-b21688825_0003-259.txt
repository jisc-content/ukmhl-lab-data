OF THE EYE. The R 4 The near-fighted perfon fees diftant objects indiftinft- Jy; and as the eye, in confequence, reds with lefs ac- curacy upon the furrounding objects, the piercing look of the eye is diminilhed, and it has a dulnefs and heavi- nefs of afpeft. Again, the near-fighted perfon knits his eye-brows, and half clofes his eyedids: This he does to change the diredfion of the rays, and to correT the inaccuracy of the image, in a manner which may be underltood by the following analogy. If we make a card approach a dream of light palling through the window, it will fo attract the rays of light, as to extend the margin of the figure of the circular fpot of light upon the wall, In the fame way, when a dream of light, proceeding from an objeft towards the eye, is made to pafs through a fmall hole, the circular margin of the hole fo attra&s the rays, as to produce the fame effect with the concave glafs; by caufing the rays to take a direction outward, as if proceeding from a nearer pbjeft, the image is carried farther back from the lens ; and when a near-dghted perfon peers through his eye-lids, it makes the rays impinge accurately upon the retina *. • » * Short-fightednefs may be produced by accidents. Sometimes I have known it produced by a piece of glafs flicking in the cornea, and caufing great inflammation. Dr. Briggs mentions the cafe of an old man, who had long ufed fpeftacles, becoming fuddenly fliort- fighted, by catching cold, and he was afterwards enabled to read the fmalleft print without glaffes. In general, however, it is by fome accident, and often late in life, that we become fenlible of being fiiort-fighted; and, in this cafe, men are very apt to attribute the deleft to fome particular occurrence.

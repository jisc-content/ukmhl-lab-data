OF THE, VEINS OF THE BRAIN. 45 they appear of a flefhy colour, projecting like papillae, or like the granulations of a fore. Pacchioni fays, <{ Ovorura inflar bombycinorum apparent,” which de- fcribes their conglobate appearance ; but they are of a pale flefhy colour, which Pacchioni fays is owing to their being furrounded with mufcular fibres. I have added the plate of Pacchioni, and contrafled it with a more natural drawing of them. The preparation from which Pacchioni had taken his plate, was previoufly macerated in vinegar. Thefe bodies being foft and vafcular, have allowed the minute injection to tranfude in fome of the experiments of anatomifts, which has given rife to the opinion of the actual communication, of the arteries of the dura mater with the finufes. As to their ufe *, I am in confiderable doubt. Joan. Fau- tonus (in his letters to Pacchioni) conceives that they give out a fluid into the finus, to dilute the venous “ Sinu longitudinali aperto, in confpedtum veniunt corpufcula ro- “ tunda, & fubrotunda, inilii forma, (a clari/T- viro Pacchiono de- “ tefta) h$c magnitudinem aciculse vulgaris caput baud fuperant, <c nifi per microfcopium iotrofpiciantur, aut ex duobus corpufculis “ combinentur.” Ruyfch, Thef. vii. N°. xxxiv. From this we lee how various the fize of thefe bodies is. In the next paragraph, he obferves, “ Vix et ne vix quidem ullum ex diftis corpufculis vi- “ dere poteft.” * It is curious that thefe bodies are confined to the longitudinal finus. et Mirum, & seque animadverfione dignum eft, hafce glan- “ dulas ad folius longitudinalis finus latera reperiri cum in laterali- “ bus finubus vel nunquam, vel raro admodum per pauca earundem “ veftigia adnotentur, ubi prasfertim praefati canales deorfum incli- “ nare incipiunt, antequamab interfeptorum dorfo difcedant.” Pac- chioni, p. 127. blood.

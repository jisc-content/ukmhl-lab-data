OF HEARING IN GENERAL. 447 ample:—“ The ear is capable of perceiving four or “ five hundred variations of tone in found, and pro- “ bably as many different degrees of flrength ; by com- “ bining thefe, we have above twenty thoufand fimple tc founds that differ either in tone or flrength, fup- pofing every tone to be perfect. But it is to be ob- “ ferved, that to make a perfedt tone, a great many “ undulations of elaflic air are required, which muft “ all be of equal duration and extent, and follow one <e another with perfect regularity ; and each undula- <c tion mufl be made up of the advance and recoil of “ innumerable particles of elaflic air, whofe motions <{ are all uniform in direction, force, and time. Hence “ we may eafily conceive a prodigious variety in the “ fame tone, arifing from irregularities of it occafioned “ by conflitution, figure, fituation, or manner of ftrik- <c ing the fonorous body ; from the conflitution of the “ elaflic medium, or its being difturbed by other “ motions; and from the conflitution of the ear itfelf f( upon which the impreffion is made. A flute, a violin, a hautboy, a French horn, may all found the <c fame tone, and be eafily diflinguifhable. Nay, if £c twenty human voices found the fame note, and with “ equal flrength, there will flill be fome difference. IC The fame voice, while it retains its proper diflinc- “ tions, may yet be varied many ways: by ficknefs ‘6 or health, youth or age, leannefs or fatnefs, good or <( bad humour. The fame words, fpoken by foreigners sC and natives, nay by different provinces of the fame nation, may be diflinguifhed * Reid’s Enquiry, p. 98. That

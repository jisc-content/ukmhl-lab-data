Vefiels attach themfelves both to the inner and to the outer furface of the cornea ; and when it becomes fpongy and vafcular in this way, little can be explained of its natural ftruClure. Thus, the pannus and ptery- gium are membranes which ftretch acrofs and adhere to the cornea, while the iris frequently attaches to its infide. In this cafe, the cornea becomes fpongy, thick, and vafcular ; and, when cut, there is red blood in it # ; and in ftaphyloma f, the iris is generally attached to the cornea. I have a preparation in which the form and character of the iris is entirely loll; it is extended into a reticulated membrane which lines the furface of the extended cornea. OF THE CHOROID COAT. The choroid is the vafcular tunic of the eye ; it is fo called from its refemblance to one of the mem- branes of the fecundines. It is the middle coat of the eye, lying betwixt the fclerotic coat and retina.

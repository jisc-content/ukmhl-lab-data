OF THE VEINS OF THE BRAIN. 53 As the finus paffes backwards It is gradually en- larging for the reception of the veins from the furface of the cerebrum. As we have already demonftrated by the marginal plate of the feftion of the longitudinal finus (page 52), the bafe of the angle is curved, an- fwering to a fulcus, which runs in all the length of the cranium, from the asthmoid bone to the crucial ridge of the occipital bone. The lateral planes are drawn tenfe and converge into an accute point; the angle formed by the fplitting of the internal layers of the dura mater, is ftrengthened by ftrong flips of fibres, which upon the infide of the finus have the effect of making it irregular, and in fome degree having the ap- pearance of cells, into fome of which cells the probe enters, and leads to the veins on the furface*of the brain; others are blind, or lead to lefler finufes, which not unfrequently run parallel for fome length to the great finus; or the probe pafles from one of thefe cells to another. Sometimes, however, the finus has no fuch irregularities, but is ftraight and fmooth through its whole length *. *' altre commimicanti lafciate dai gia defcritti fafci della fibrofa, 44 fenza che ad efle giunga vafo aliuno.” Malacame, p. 94. “ He cellulae ab expofito finu ad verticem ufque, uberiores, “ atque magis amplse perfpiciuntur, et inequaliter bine inde locantur; “ ipfaram plurimse vacua funt habentque orificia in oppofitas quad 44 partes hiantia ; membrania circumteguntur quse eft inftar valvulae 44 femilunaris, totam tamen cavitatem non occludentis ; reliquae v&o 44 faveolas tantummodo impervias reprefentant.” Pacchioni, p. 124. * The internal membrane of the finus is perfedlly fmooth, and is conlinuecHnto the coats of the internal jugular veins} it is of the nature with the internal coat of the vein.

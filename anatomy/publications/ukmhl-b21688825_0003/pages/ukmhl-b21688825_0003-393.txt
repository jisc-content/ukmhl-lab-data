OF THE EYE-LIDS. 369 of the duCts, which then fwells up into a little hard granule in the edge of the eye-lid, accompanied with inflammation of its cyft or furrounding membrane. O-F THE SECRETION AND COURSE OF THE TEARS. The lachrymal gland is feated in the upper and outer part of the orbit, and behind the fuperciliary ridge of the frontal bone. It is of a flattened form, and is depreflfed into a hollow of the bone. Several duCts from this gland open upon the inner furface of the upper eye-lid. By the reflection of the membrana conjunctiva from the eye-lid over the furface of the eye-ball, dull and motes are prevented from getting behind the eye ball; and when they have got under the eye-lids, the extreme fenfibility of the tunica con- junctiva excites the lachrymal gland, and the orbicular mufcle of the eye-lids, (which, by its preflure, accele- rates the flow of the tears), and the dull or motes are wafhed out. The punCta for reabforbing the tears and conveying them into the nofe, being at the inner angle or canthus of the eye-lids, we fee the intention of the duds of the lachrymal gland opening on the inflde of the upper eye-lid towards the outer angle: for, by this means, the tears are fpread over all the furface of the eye-ball, by the motion of the eye-lids, before they decline into the punCla. But the tears do not flow only when the gland is excited by motes; their fecretion is perpetual, and, together with the motion of the eye-lids, they perpetually moiften the furface of the eye-ball. Even during fleep they flow continually : and here we may admire a provifion for theâ€™r

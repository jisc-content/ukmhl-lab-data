104 OF THE VENTRICLES OF THE TRAIN. OF THE FOURTH VENTRICLE. The fourth ventricle defcends perpendicularly before the cerebellum ; it is inclofed above by the valvula cere- bri, below by the medulla fpinse, and on the right and left by the crura cerebelli. When we pafs our probe obliquely backwards and downwards under the pofterior commiffure, it palfes into the iter ad quartum ventriculum, or aque- duct of Silvius. This paffage to the fourth ventri- cle, goes before the tubercula quadrigemina. The valvula vieussenii, it was fuppofed, prevented the falling down of the moiflure of the other cavities into the fourth ventricle * : it is more properly called the processus cerebelli ad testes, being a medullary lamina fpread over the ventricle and betwixt the crura cerebelli, as they rife from the arbor vitee, or the in- ternal medullary part of the cerebellum. From the aquedudt there is continued down upon the fore part of the fourth ventricle a kind of fiffure ; which Vefalius, conceiving it to have fome refemblance to a writing quill, called calamus scriptorius. The fame fiffure or furrow is continued down fome way upon the fpinal marrow. There pafs up obliquely outwards, on each fide of ' the calamus fcriptorius, medullary lines, three or four in number, but fometimes feven are obferved f. One of thefe fibres afcends to the valvula Vieuffenii; fome are the origines of the auditory nerve, and one or two ffriae go to form part of the eighth. * Alveus Silvii. f Haller, Phyfiol. tom. iv. p. 7S.

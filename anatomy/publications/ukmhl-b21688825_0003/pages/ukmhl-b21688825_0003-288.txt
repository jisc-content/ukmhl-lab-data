OF THE fins. 264 means, in difeafe of internal parts of the eye, ft Is often? an index to us of the flate of the nerve, and of the poflibility of giving relief by operation. The iris and corona cilraris, or ciliary proceffes, are., in general, confidered as being the two laminae of the choroid coat continued forward and fplit i The inter- nal lamina of the choroid forming the' corona cifiaris, and the outer one forming the iris. The former I was willing to confider as the anterior margin of the choroid coat, becaufe it has no diftinCtion in its ftruc- ture from that coat j but the iris I cannot confider as the continued choroid coat :â–  in the jirji place, becaufe I have found it fall out a perfeCt circle by maceration j fecondly, becaufe it has no refemblance in ftruCture to the choroid coat; and, chiefly, as by its power of con- tracting, it fhows a widely different character from any of the other membranes of the eye. The outer furface of this circular membrane gives the colour to the eye during life; and from its beauti- ful and variegated colours, it has gained to the whole membrane the name of iris. Haller and Zinn, nearly at the fame time, explained the caufe of this coloured iris, which had been, till then, fuppofed to be occa- fioned by the refraCtion of the light amongft its ftriae and fibres. When this membrane is put in water, and examined with the microfcope, its anterior furface is feen to be covered with minute villi. The-fplendid colouring of the iris proceeds from the villi; but by beginning pu- trefaction, the fplendid reflection fades, as the brilliant furface of the choroid of brutes is loft by keeping. Tor this reafon, I imagine the colour and brilliancy of the

OF SEEING IN GENERAL.' ^>57 gradually reftored. Is there, then, in this cafe pro- duced a new correfpondence betwixt points of the re- tina which were before difcordant ? We find that this is not the cafe, by a very fimple experiment.—In a ,perfon who fquints, one of the eyes is directed to the objedt and the other appears to be turned from it: if the found eye be fhut, and the perfon be diredted to look to an objedt with the other, it is diredted to it with the proper and natural axis< Now this fiiows us that the fenfibility of the proper fpot in the bottom of the eye is not loft. We muft explain the fingle vifion in eyes, one of which is diftorted from its natural axis, upon another principle. Moft people who fquint, have a defedt in one eye, and this is the diftorted eye, while the other is directed in the true axis to the objedt. Now the mind does not attend eafily to two irii- preflions, the one being weaker than the other : In a fliort time the weaker imprellion is entirely negledted, and the ftronger only is perceived.—So in fquinting, the impreftion on the weak eye in a ftiort time ceafes to be attended to, the fti'ong and vivid impreftion is alone perceived, and fingle vifion is the confequence. It is evident, then, that thofe who fquint muft have a degree of imperfedtion in the ftrength of the image ; for it is neceflary to negledt the impreftion of one eye, to obtain diftindl vifion with the other; the confequence of this is frequently an attempt ftill further to diftort the eye, and turn it fo far inward or under the upper eye-lid that no diftindt impreftion can be received upon it; at all events, they perceive the objedt only with one eye, although they may be faid to fee it with both; the Vol. III.

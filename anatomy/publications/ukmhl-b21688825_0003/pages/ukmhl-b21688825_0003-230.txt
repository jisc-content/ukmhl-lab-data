OF THE PARTICULAR NERVES, 204 OF THE CUTANEOUS N'ERVES OF THE BACK OF THE THIGH. When the integuments are differed off from the nates and back of the thigh, we fee two fources of the cutaneous nerves; firft from the lumbar nerves, which give out many fmall nerves which pafs over the fpine of the os ilii, and the branches of the anterior and outer cutaneous nerve ; and fecondly, from under the lower margin of the great gluteus mufcle, there come many extenfive cutaneous nerves. Thefe are derived from the nervus cutaneus pofterior et fuperior, and branches of the ifchiatic nerve, in this manner; Juft as the great ifchiatic nerve has efcaped from the pelvis, it is joined by the superior and posterior , cutaneous nerve ; or, rather, a fmall twig is fent oft' from the great nerve to join this cutaneous nerve * on its emerging from the pelvis. It divides into feve- ral branches, and it is one of thefe which may be feen fuperficial and above the delicate fafcia, running down upon the outer ham-ftring mufcles, to the back of the knee-joint. Another branch piercing the fafcia fepa- rately, comes down upon the integuments covering the outer and back part of the thigh, and terminates on the outftde of the knee. A little further down, the ifchi- atic nerve gives off fmall nerves to the mufcles fur- pounding the hip joint; and, whilft the fciatic nerve is palling over the quadratus femoris, the inferior and * The pofterior cutaneous nerve rifes in general from the trunk of the ifchiatic nerve, within the pelvis, and is joined by a branch from the third facral nejvc,â€”Ioerd.

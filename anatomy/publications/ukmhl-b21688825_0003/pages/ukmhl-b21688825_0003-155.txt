OF TI-IE PARTICULAR NERVES. 129 CHAP. IV. OF THE PARTICULAR NERVES. THE FIRST PAIR OF NERVES J OR, OLFACTORY NERVES. We have defcribed the three roots of this pair of nerves: their triangular form, their bulbous extremi- ties, and their manner of perforating the crebriform plate of the asthmoid bone. Where the foft and pulpy-like mafs of the olfa&ory nerves perforates the aethmoid bone, the dura mater involves them, and gives them firm coats*. There are two fets of nerves; firft, Thofe which pafs through the holes in the crebriform plate, neared the crifta galli, run down upon the feptum of the nofe, under the fchneiderian membrane, and betwixt it and the periof- teum. They become extremely minute as they defcend; and they, finally, pafs into the foft fubftance of the membrane. Secondly, Thofe filaments which pafs down by the outer fet of holes of the aethmoid plate, are diftributed to the membrane invelting the fpongy bones. * Duverney firft obferved this courfe and firmnefs of the olfactory nerves.

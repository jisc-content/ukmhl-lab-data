OF THE SENSES. 219 There There is dill another degree or clafs of difeafed fen- Cation, confifting in the modification of objedts which .are actually prefent to the fenfes. But this modifica- tion of things prefent (as when bodies actually at reft appear to be in motion) is not always occafioned by optical deception. Objedfs feem to turn round, and this we fhall afterwards find to proceed from the infen- fible motion of the eyes; but this motion of the eyes is occafioned by the difordered date of the internal fenfation ; and the fame feeling will be experienced if the eyes are fhut. For example, when we turn quickly round on our heel until we become giddy, it would appear that there is a difturbance of the ufual order of fenfation, and that the courfe of our imprefiions is reverfed; for while our fenfations were formerly di- rected entirely by the impreffion made on the outward fenfes, the fenforial imprefiions now draw after them a fympathetic motion of the external organs. This inverted communication betwixt the mind and organs is better exemplified in the organ of fpcech. Thoughts excited in the mind are reprefented by the figns of thefe ideas in fpeech. There occurs, however, not unfrequently, a difeafed date of thefe operations of the internal fenfes, in which the ideas excited in the mind cannot be adociated with their appropriate ex- predions; and although the patient has a didindf idea of what he means to exprefs, he cannot recoiled! the words which belong to it; fo that, when he afks for one thing, he names another which has no connedtion with it. Of this he is perfedlly fenfible, and yet he cannot corredf himfqlf.

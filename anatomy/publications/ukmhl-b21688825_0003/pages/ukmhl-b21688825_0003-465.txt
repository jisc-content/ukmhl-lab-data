44* OF HEARING IN GENERAL# We fee that the external ear collects the vibrations of found as it moves in the atmofphere with circular undulation from the fonorous body : here we may ob- ferve, that where the neceffities of animals require them to be better provided with this external part of -the organ than man, the fuperiority is only in the hmple perception of found ; while man, from the per- fection of the internal organ, excels all animals in the capacity of the ear for articulate and mufical founds. From the external ear vre obferve, that the trumpet- like tube conveys the found inward to the membrane of the tympanum. Behind the membrane of the tym- panum, there is a cavity which, in order to allow of the free vibration of the membrane, contains air.— When this air is pent up, by the fwelling or adhefion of the euflachean tube, the elafticity of the air is diminilned, and the membrane prevented from vi- brating *. In the tympanum, we have feen that the operation of the chain of bones is to encreafe the vibration re- ceived upon the membrane of the tympanum, and to tranfmit it to the membrane of the foramen ovale. In the cavity of the tympanum we obferved two foramina, the foramen ovale and the foramen rotundum, both of which lead into the labyrinth ; but one of them (the foramen ovale) into the yeftibule, the other (the fora- men rotundum) into the fcala of the cochlda: now it be- * See Recherches, See. relatives a P organ e e’e Pome & a la propa- gation des Jovs, par M.

OF THE EYE-LIDS. the commencing inflammation, we fee the vefifels tur- gid or blood-fliot: by and bye, they elongate to- wards the fuface of the cornea ; the patient complains of dimnefs; the dimnefs becomes apparent to the fur- geon ; fpots of opacity then form in the cornea ; and the veflfels of the conjunctiva now take a courfe over the turbid furface of the cornea. In this ftage of the inflammation, by cutting the turgid veffels of the con- junctiva, we interrupt the fource of blood for a time, and procure a fmall evacuation ; but thefe veflfels foon coalefce again, and the flow of blood is renewed. The tunica albuginea is the thin tendinous coat formed by the infertion of the reCti mufcles, which expand over the anterior part of the eye. I would admit this into the enumeration of the coats of the eye, merely to prevent confufion of names, and to make intelligible the defcriptions of fome of the older writers. It is not properly a coat. Where the conjunctiva covers the anterior part of the eye, the white fclerotic coat is feen under it; and in conference of this, the tunica conjunctiva is fometimes called albuginea. A very material part of the ftructure or the eye ftiil remains to be defcribed; an apparatus by which the furface of the eye is preferved from injury, kept moifl:, and perfectly tranfparent. The eye-lids are compofed of the common inte- guments, with this difference only, that they have a cartilaginous margin to give them fliape, and mufcular fibres, in the duplicature of their membrane, to give them motion. A fmall femilunar cartilage, which lies like a hoop in their edge, keeps them of a regular figure, and fo as to dofe neatly over the eye. This cartilage . O

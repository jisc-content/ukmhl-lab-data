Immediately above the elbow joint, twigs are fent off, fome of which accompany |:he ramus analtamoticus major of the brachial artery. After pafling the condyle of the humerus, it fends a branch to the flexor carpi ulnaris, and to the head of the flexor digitorum profundus. It then finks deeper betwixt the flexor ulnaris and flexor digitorum fubli- mis; it is here connected with the ulnar artery, and defcends along with it to the wrift. In this courfe, along the fore-arm, the ulnar nerve gives branches to the flexor digitorum fubiimis. Often it fends a branch of communication to the radial nerve, while fome few lefler mufcular nerves are fent off, and accompany the branches of the ulnar artery. When arrived near the wrift, the ulnar nerve di- vides Into two branches. The continued trunk pafles. on under the protection of the tendon of the flexor ul- naris, and then under the arcular ligament into the palm of the hand ; while the branch takes a turn un- der the flexor ulnaris, and over the edge of the flexor digitorum profundus. It pafles then over the lower end of the ulna to the back of the hand. On the back of the hand it is found branching over the expanded tendons and under the veins, and is finally diftributed to the back of the little and ring fingers. This is the ramus pojiicus. The continued ulnar nerve pafles under the palmaris brevis mufcle and palmar apponeurofis, and above the flexor brevis and adduftor minimi digiti. Here it di- vides into two, (the fubiimis and profundus of Camper,) '. v - and.

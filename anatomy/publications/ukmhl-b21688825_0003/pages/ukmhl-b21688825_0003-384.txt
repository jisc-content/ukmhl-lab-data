360 OF SEEING IN GENERAL. the origin of fquinting than is generally fuppofed. It is faid, by Dr. Reid and others, that we fee young people, in their frolics, learn to fquint, making their eyes either converge or diverge when they will to a very confiderable degree : Why fhould it be more difficult for a fquinting perfon to learn to look ftraight when he pleafes ? The reafon of the greater difficulty is obvious, that in making the eyes converge or diverge the will is ailing upon both eyes equally; but to dis- tort one eye inward or outward, and at the fame time to keep the other fixed, is to me like an abfolute im- poffibility. Mod people, who fquint, have a defied in the diftorted eye, a weaknefs which they do not ob- ferve, from want of attention to the impreffions upon that eye. It will be difficult to determine whether this defeil be an original fault, or the effiedt of the want of ufe; fince, by tying up the found eye, the weak one becomes gradually ftronger, fo that the perfon becomes able to read with it, much may be attributed to the negleil of impreffions. It may be obferved, that this negleil of the impref- fions, which are ailually received, is not at all like that difufe, which is the confequence of no impreffion being received: for darknefs encreafes the fenfibility of the re- tina, while this diffipates and exhaufts it. That fquint- ing is not produced by the weaknefs of the impreffion received upon the nerve, would appear from the cir- cumftance that opacity of the humors or the gutta ferena do not occafion an alteration of the ufual corre- fpondence in the mufclds moving the eye-balls. It is faid, that in thofe who have loft the fight of one eye, the habit of directing it to the object they look at is

CFIO^OID COAT AND IRIS. 2 73 the catarad; for, as foon as the aqueous humor is evacuated, the uniform refiltance of the coats of the eye is deftroyed, and the mufcles furrounding the eye- ball force all the humors towards the incifion. It is this circumftance which brings the iris into great dan- ger of being cut when the knife is too narrow to make the incifion, at once, by pufhing it through the cornea with an uninterrupted motion of the fingers. For, when the knife is not broad enough to cut itfelf out by moving it uniformly along, the aqueous humor efcapes in the endeavour to cut downwards, and the iris is pro- truded fo as to fall under the edge of the knife ; nay, with a good knife, and of a fhape to cut itfelf out, and at the fame time adapted to make a cut in the cornea fuf- ficient to allow the efcape of the lens, I have feen, in con- fequence of a hefitating manner of introducing the knife, the aqueous humor fullered to efcape. Now, obferve the confequence of this :—The lens being pulhed out- wards by the contraftion of the mufcles on the eye-ball, towards that point at which the continuity and con- fequent uniform refifiance of the coats were broken, the margin of the iris was forced under the edge of the knife and cut, as I have here reprefented.

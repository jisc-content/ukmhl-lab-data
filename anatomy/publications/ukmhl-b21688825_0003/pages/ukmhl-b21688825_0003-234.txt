20$ OF THE PARTICULAR NERVES* THE . FIBULAR NERVE. The fibular nerve is the more external divifion of the popliteal nerve. It feparates from the tibial branch about four inches above the knee-joint; it does not pafs down under the gaftrocnemius, like the tibial nerve, but turns towards the outfide of the joint, and paffes round the head of the fibula, and under the origin of the peroneus longus.â€”Before the fibular nerve paffes from behind the joint, it gives off feveral branches. There are fent down two branches to the integuments. One of thefe branches unites with the communicans tibiei, and defcends with it to the outer ancle. Sometimes this anaftamofis is formed high in the leg upon the. heads of the gaftrocnemius. More generally there is a double communication formed by thefe nerves about the termination of the belly of the gaftrocnemius mufcle in the achilles tendon. This pro- longed branch of the fibular nerve terminates upon the fide and upper part of the foot, and upon the little toe. There are alfo fome nerves fent off from the fibular, which are diftributed about the back and fides of the knee-joint. When the fibular nerve has turned over the head of the fibula, it divides into two great branches. The DEEPER SEATED of THESE BRANCHES, though i,t is not the largeft of them, may be confidered as the continued trunk. It paffes deep amcngft the mufcles, lying betwixt the tibia and fibula, and fupplies the tibialis anticus, the extenfor communis digitorum, ex- tenfor longus policis, and the peroneus brevis. Thus the deeper divifion of the fibular nerve, taking its courfe (

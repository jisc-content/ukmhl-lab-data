The criftalline humor is a fmall body, of the lhape of an opticianâ€™s lens, of great power. It is of perfect tranfparency, and of denfity much greater than the vitreous humour. Its denfity to that of the vitreous humor is calculated to be as 1114 to 1016. But the criftalline is not of uniform denfity, for the centre forms a denfer nucleus. The form of the cryftalline is that of a comprelfed fphere, the anterior furface being more comprelfed or flatter, though, in a degree, convex. According to Petit, the anterior furface is the fegment of a fphere whofe diameter is 7, 8, or even nine lines. The pofterior furface is a fphere of 41 or 5, or 5! lines in diameter. The internal ftructure of the lens is quite peculiar, and refembles neither the vitreous nor the aqueous humor. By maceration, it fplits into lamellae, and at the fame time burfts up into equal parts, fo that there is firft. a ftellated-like filfure, and then it feparates into pretty regular divifions; and after maceration in acids, the lens can be teafed out into minute flireds and fibres *. From its form, denfity, and central nucleus, it has great power of converging the rays of light; and in an eye properly conftituted, it concentrates them accurately to the furface of the retina. For this reafon, it is placed before the vitreous humor, and focketed in its anterior * See further of the mufcularity of tire len-s. Y 4 part.

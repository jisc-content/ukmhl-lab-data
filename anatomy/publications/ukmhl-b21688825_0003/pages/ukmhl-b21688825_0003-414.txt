39° OF THE ORGAN OF HEARING. portion of the auditory nerve is expanded. In the cartilaginous fifties, there are three lapilli # contained in their proper capfules, and furrounded with a gela- tinous matter f, each of the lapilli having its appropri- ated divifion of the acauftic or auditory nerve diftri- buted upon it in a beautiful network. This cavity in the head of fifties, refembles the centre of the labyrinth in the human ear, and is called the veftibule. Within the veftibule there is a limpid fluid, interfered every where by a delicate and tranfparent cellular membrane ; and the parts within the veftibule are fupported in their place by this tifliie, which is fimilar to that which fupports the brain in fifties. Befides this central part of the organ in fifties, there are departing from the veftibule three femicircular cartilaginous canals j, within which, are extended membranous canals. Thefe membranous tubes contain a fluid diftindt from that contained in the common cavity of the veftibule, nor have they any com- munication with the facculi, which contain the la- pilli, although they are connedied with them §. Thefe cartilaginous canals are of a cylindrical form, and, being as tranfparent as the fluid with which they are furrounded, are not readily diftinguiftied in * In many of the fpinous or fquamous fifties, there is only one. In cartilaginous fifties, thefe bodies are not like bone, but like foft chalk. In the fpinous fifties, on the other hand, they arc of the fhape of the head of a fpear, and hard like (tone. f The gelatinous matter is rather before the bones, and diftend- ing the little facculi. $ See plate 7. fig. 3. and fig. 4. ddd. § So Profeffor Scarpa aliens, in contradiction to others. diffedtion.

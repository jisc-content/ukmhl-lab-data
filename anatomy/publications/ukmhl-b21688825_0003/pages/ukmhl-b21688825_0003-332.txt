308 OF THE MEMBRANA PUPrLLARIS. time, when the membrana pupillaris exifts in its full flrength and vafcularity, no light is admitted into the eye—the foetus is lying in its mother’s womb. Towards the ninth month, the membrane has become tranfparent, and if not totally abforbed, it is torn by the firft motion of the pupil and altogether difappears. It can therefore have no effeCt in obfcuring the light, and preventing it from exciting in too great a degree the eye of the newly-born child. To explain the effeCt of this mem- brane, then, we have only to confider that it is of the nature of the iris to contract its circular fibres during the operation of light, fo as to clofe or nearly clofe the pupil; that, on the other hand, the pupil is completely dilated through the operation of the radicated fibres of the iris in darknefs:—To the queftion, then, why it is not dilated during the foetal Hate ? The anfwer, I think, js decidedly this :—The iris is not loofe in the foetal flate, it is connected and flretched to the middle degree of contraction and dilatation by the membrana pupillaris. Were the iris in a full flate of contraction, during the life of the foetus, it could not receive its full nourifh- ment, proper degree of extenfion, and due powers ; but being preferved flationary and extended, the dif- pofition to contraction, which it mult have when the retina is without excitement, is counteracted, until it is about to receive, by the birth of the child, that degree of excitement which is to keep up the preponderance towards the contracted flate of the pupil.

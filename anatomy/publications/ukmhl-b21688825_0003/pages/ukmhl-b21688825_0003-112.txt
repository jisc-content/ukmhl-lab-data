S6 0? THE VENTRICLES OF THE ERAIN* The LESSER HIPPOCAMPOS, Or COLLICULUS, IS R relief or convexity in the floor of the pofterior horn of the ventricles, which may be traced backwards from the crura of the fornix. It has the fame relation to the fornix which the greater hippocampos has, and' lies in the pofterior horn or prolongation of the ven- tricle into the pofterior lobe of the brain, in the fame way in which the great hippocampos lies in the infe- rior horn or prolongation of the ventricle into the middle lobe of the brain. The velum and plexus require to be taken away be- fore we can fully underftand the fituation of the third ventricle, or of thofe tubercles which are but partially been in the lateral ventricles. The velum lies in the centre of the brain,and extends from the furface of the brain inwards betwixt the pofte- rior lobes of the cerebrum and the cerebellum, then betwixt the corpus callofivm and nates and teftes, and then under the fornix. It forms thus a great commu- nication betwixt the external and internal membranes of the brain. As it lies under the fornix, that medul- lary lamina adheres to it, while the velum again ad- heres to the thalami nervorum opticoruin. Its margin feems to be terminated laterally by the choroid plexus (when we view it after raiflng the fornix); but it is not ftriclly fo, for the choroid plexus is continued with the membrane of the ventricles, and has no where a ter- mination. For the vafcularity of this membrane, turn to what has already been faid in fpeaking of the inter- nal veins of the brain. Seeing how the plexus choroides are formed and con- nected, they cannot be ftrictly faid to have either begin- ning

$8 OF THE VENTRICLES OF THE BRAIN* infundibulum AND PITUITARY GLAND. What i$ called the pituitary gland is a redilh body of a glandular-like ftru&ure *, which is feated in the fella turcica of the fphenoid bone. It is plain upon its upper furface, or rather perhaps a little hol- lowed, of a globular fhape below, and having' a di- vifion into two lobes. The infundibulum terminates in it, piercing the dura mater, a thin lamina of which fpreads over the gland. The gland, as is feen in the above plate, lies furrounded with the circular fmus, and has the cavernous finus upon the fides ; into thefe laft, veflels have been feen to pafs from the gland f, which, as Soemmerring obferves, were probably veins. A diftinttion of fubftance has been obferved in this * It perhaps has only the form of a gland. Haller fays ** non «* acinofa quidam, neque nullius alterius glanduke fimiles, quae po- « tius cerebri quedam fit appendix.” See alfo Bordeu, recherch. Anatomiq. fur les Glands. •j- Adolph.

337 DISTANCE OF OBJECTS. degree of convexity; and that the elafticity of the capfule, and the tone of the ligament, may be looked upon as two antagonifts perfectly in equilibrio with one another. In the date of reft, the eye is conceived, by Dr. Jurin, to be adapted to the middle diftance ; by the encreafe of the convexity of the cornea, to be adapted to nearer vifion; and by the change in the capfule of the lens, to be fitted to diftant objects. To this laft fuppofition it is objected, that there is a fimplicity in the operations of nature; that the change, wrought upon the capfule of the lens, is infufficient to account for the whole effed, and that, therefore, there is a prefumption that it has no fhare in producing the change ; that there are no mufcular fibres in the ciliary procefles; and, laftly, that this fluid, being of denflty but little^ if at all, removed from the aqueous humor, any alteration of its form can have but a very infig- nificant effed. It has occurred to others *, that the oblique mufcles of the eye-ball, being thrown in oppofite diredions round it, they may have the effed of elongating the axis of the eye : Again, that the adion of the orbicularis mufcle of the eye-lids, by comprefling the eye-ball, aflifts in accommodating the eye for feeing near objeds more diftindtly. Dr. Monro makes a fet of experiments to prove the effed of the orbicularis mufcle of the eye- lids ; but I conceive that he has deceived himfelf, in afcribing to the compreflion of the eye-lids an effed partly produced by a voluntary effort, but in a way which is not underftood, and partly by the contradion * Hainbergerus, Briggs, Keil, Monro. and

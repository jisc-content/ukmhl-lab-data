OF THE RETINA. 279 pendence of its function on the circulation, and de- duce the derangement of the powers of vifion, as a natural eonfequence of the difordered attion of thefe velfels. The foft medullary matter of the retina is towards the furface of the choroid coat, and forms there a la- mina, which appears to me to be the furface of uhe nerve upon which the rays of light impinge *. The velfels of the retina run upon the furface contiguous to the vitrious humor f. The arteria centralis retinas is derived from the opthalmic artery. It pierces the optic nerve, as we have already obferved, ancT enters the eye through the porus opticus, to fupply the retina. But the arteries of the retina do not always enter into the eye in one trunk; on the contrary, fometimes two or three branches pierce the lamina cribrofa |, and afterwards, two, three, or four principal branches, * “ C’eft fur-tout dans les poifions qu’il eft facile de diftinguer et “ meme de feparer ces deux lames.” Cuvier, tom. ii. p. 419. The opacity of the outer furface of the retina prevents the vafcu- larity from being apparent. Albinus, after a very minute iniedlion, obferved, that when he lifted up the choroid coat, the vafcularity of the retina was not feen : “ Autem de ea aliquid acuto fcalpello fub- “ tiliter leviflimeque deradens, raox confpicio vafa impleta multa “ qute fub medulla cujus nimirum portionem deraferam la^eraTm” Albin.

Acad. lib. iii. cap. xiv. t Dr. Monro has thefe words, expreffire of an dppofite opinion 5 “ The whole appears to be compofed of an uniform pulpy matter, on the outer fide of which chiefly velfels are difperfed, fupported, I ftippofe, by a membrane the fame or analogous to the pia mater.” 4to Treatifes cn the eye, ear, &c. t Haller loc. cit.

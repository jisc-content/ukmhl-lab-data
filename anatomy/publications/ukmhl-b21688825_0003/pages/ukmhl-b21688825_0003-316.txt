2p2 o-t +H5 RETINA. One diftinfHon of the former is, that we can correft the deception by the afliftanfe of the other fenfes, while, in the latter, the mind is difeafed. Old people are often troubled with the appearance of dark irregular fpots flying before their eyes. In fever, alfo, it is very common to fee the patient pick- ing the bed-clothes, or catching at the empty air. This proceeds from an appearance of motes or flies pafling before the eyes, and is occafioned by an affec- tion of the retina, producing in it a fenfation fimilar to that produced by the knpreflion of images; and what is deficient in the fenfation, the imagination fup- plies; for, although the refemblance betwixt thofe difeafed affections of the retina and the idea conveyed to the brain may be very remote, yet, by that flight refemblance, the idea, ufually aflociated with the fen- fation, will be excited in the mind. M. de la Hire attributed the fixed fpots to drop's of extravafated blood on the retina, and the flying ones, to motes in the aqueous humors * ; but we fhall fhow prefently, that this apparent motion of the motes before the eyes may be a deception. After turning round upon the heel for fome time, obje&s apparently continue in motion. Dr. Porterfield fuppofed this to proceed from a miflake with refpeft to the eye, which, though it be at reft, we conceive to move the contrary way to that * “ Guttula cruoris retinae infidens et nigricans, omnem lucera intercipiet unde phantafrtia obfcurum vel nigrum ; verum fi dilutus c'ruor radios rubros tranfmittat tunc maculam rubram videbit xger ut omnia trans vitrum infpefta rubra funt.” bauvag'e, vol. iv. p. 287. in

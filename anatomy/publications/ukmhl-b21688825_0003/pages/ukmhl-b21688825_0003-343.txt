OF THE HUMORS OF THE EYE. 319 lamina, which pafTes behind the lens and before the vitreous humor, receives and conveys the artery of the capfule; on the fore part of the lens the anterior lamina only touches the capfule of the lens, adheres, and is then reflected off to form the membrana pu- pillaris. In this account I am fupported by the mod careful inveftigation, and by the fimplicity of this fyftem of veffels : for it will be obferved, that it is on the mem- brana vafculofa alone that the veffels, carrying red blood in the foetus, are fupported, and that it fhows throughout the fame chara&er for vafcularity. Again, I think it probable that this membrane which paffes be- fore the lens, viz. the membrana pupillaris, and that which paffes behind the lens, forming the vafcular capfule of the lens, difappears at the fame time ; or if this poflerior and vafcular membrane which paffes be- hind the lens is not totally abforbed, it becomes thin Â£$d more intimately united to the membrana vitrea.

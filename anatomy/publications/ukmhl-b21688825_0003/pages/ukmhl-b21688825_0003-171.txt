OF THE PARTICULAR NERVES. J45 municating with the ninth pair of nerves, are diftribut- ed, finally, to the gums and membrane of the mouth. The guftatory nerve terminates in a lafli of nerves, which fink deep into the fubftance of the tongue, betwixt the infertion of the ftylo and genio-gloffal mufcles. Thefe pafs to the papillae on the furface of the tongue. The fenfe of tafle, the impreflion of which is received upon this nerve, is feated in the edge and anterior part of the tongue : the a&ion of the tongue againft the pa- late forces the fapid juice of the morfel to extend to the edge of the tongue. The proper lower maxillary nerve, which enters into the lower jaw-bone, fometimes called, mundibulo labralh, pafles downward in an oblique direftion to the groove of the lower jaw-bone. Before this nerve enters the canal of the bone, it gives off branches to the mylo- hyoideus and digafiricus, to the fubmaxillary glands and to the fat. The nerve then entering the bone, runs its courfe all the length of the lower jaw within the bone, and comes out at the mental hole. In this courfe it gives branches which enter the roots of the teeth, and accompany the branches of the arteries. When this lower maxillary nerve has efcaped from the mental hole, it divides into two branches upon the chin; one of thefe is diftributed to the orbicularis and depreflor anguli oris, and to the {kin and glands of the lips ; the other to the deprelfor labii inferioris and in- teguments, and forms a kind of plexus, which fur- rounds the lips. Thefe nerves are alfo connected with the wide fpreading branches of the portio dura of the feventh pair; and they are the lowed: branches of the Vol. III. I. facial

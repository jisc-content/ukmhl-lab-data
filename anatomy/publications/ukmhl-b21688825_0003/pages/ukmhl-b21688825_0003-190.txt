i6a of the particular nerves. into a kind of ganglion, and then divides into two branches. The anterior of thefe branches is the fmaller. It pafles down upon the infide of the vertebral artery ; its filaments unite with the hypogloflal nerve, or ninth pair, and with the fuperior cervical ganglion of the fympathetic, and with the firfl: branch of the fecond cervical nerve *. The larger and polterior branch di- vides into eight twigs, which are chiefly diflributed to the mufcles moving the headâ€”to the oblique fuperior and inferior, the recti poftici and laterales, complexus, and fplenius. Some of thofe mufcular branches unite with that branch of the fecond cervical nerve which afcends upon the occiput. Second cervical nerve. This nerve, arifing by a double origine from the fpinal marrow, like the other nerves of the fpine, pafles betwixt the firfl and fecond vertebrae. It is larger than the lafl; and, after form- ing a little ganglion by the fide of the tranfverfe pro- cefs of the firfl vertebra, divides into two branches. The superior branch fends up a confiderable divifion behind the projection of the tranfverfe procefs of the firfl vertebra, to unite to the fuboccipital or firfl cervical nerve. Several twigs pafs forward 'to unite with the fuperior cervical ganglion of the fym- pathetic nerve, and with fome of the more anterior branches of the third cervical nerve, and with the ninth and fpinal acceffory nerves. Befides thefe in- tricate connexions, irregular branches of this nerve * A very fmall nerve is defcribed by fome authors as paffing from the anterior divifion of the nerve, into the canal of the vertebral artery.

168 OF THE PARTICULAR NERVES. thetic, and eighth pair. The lower cervical nerves again are dill fupporting their connections with the lower ganglion of the fympathetic. Further, we find the phrenic nerve derived (mod: frequently) from the third and fourth, and branch of communication betwixt the fourth and fifth. The axillary plexus is formed by the fifth, fixth, fe- venth, and eighth cervical nerves, and fil'd: of the back. OF THE DORSAL NERVES. There are twelve dorfal nerves. Thefe, as we have defcribed, are formed by two fafciculi of fibres; one from the fore, and the other from the back part of the fpinal marrow. Thefe filaments run for fome way fuperficially in the length of the fpinal marrow before they pierce the dura mater. They pierce it feparatelv; the poderior branch firfl forms a ganglion, and then the two fafciculi are united. They are now betwixt the heads of the ribs. We muff here recoiled:, that the trunk of the fympathetic nerve, which pades along the cavity of the thorax, runs down behind the pleura, and pades before the heads of the ribs through all the length of the back. It receives, as it pades the interdices of the feveral ribs, at each interval, a com- municating nerve from the fpinal marrow; a branch from the intereodal or dorfal nerves. Thofe communications are fent in the following manner : the proper dorfal, or intereodal nerve, fends its greater branch forwards betwixt the ribs ; fome leder branches pierce backwards to the mufcles of the back; oppofite to this there goes out from each nerve the fird branch of union with the fympathetic, and this

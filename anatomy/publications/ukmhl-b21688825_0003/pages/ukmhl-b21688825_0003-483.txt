op THE MOUTH AND TONGUE. 459 H h 4 The The base of the tongue is connefted with the os hyoides. The furface applied to the roof of the mouth is the dorsum ; and on this furface there is to be obferved a middle line, dividing the tongue into two lateral portions ; a divifion which is very accurately preferved in the diftribution of the blood-veffels and nerves of either fide. On the dorfum, towards the bafe, the furface is rough with the papilla maxima and foramen cacum of * Morgagni. Thefe papilla are like fmall glands feated in little fuperficial foflula, fo that their broad mulh- room-like heads alone are feen ; but they are connected with the bottom of the folfula by fhort Hems or necks. This is altogether a glandular apparatus. The foramen cacum is, in truth, only an enlarged apparatus of the lame kind, for, in the bottom of this foramen, many glandular papilla Hand up; and in its bottom fmall foramina have been obferved, which are generally con- ceived to be the mouths of fmall falivary dufts *. This fecreting mucous furface begins here, towards the toot of the tongue, to referable the glandular ftrufture of the cefophagus, which, by bedewing the furface of the morfel, fits it for an eafy palfage through the gullet. In this roughnefs of the root of the tongue, there feems to be a provifion for the detenfion of the fapid particles, and the prolonging of the fenfations of tafte. * Vater, who inje&ed thefe duÂ£is, found them terminating in a gland near the os hyoides ; and his opinion was, that they had eren a conne&ion with the thyroid gland. Heifter was of the fame opinion.

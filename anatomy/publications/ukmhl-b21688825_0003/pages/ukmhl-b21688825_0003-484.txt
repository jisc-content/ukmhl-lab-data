460 OF THE MOUTH AND TONGUE. The papillae peculiar to the human tongue, arc divided into four dalles. 1. Thefe larger papillae upon the root of the tongue are the truncatae; and they are often ftudded on the dorfum of the tongue in a trian- gular form. 2. The fungiformes are obtufe papillae found more forward on the tongue; they are little hemifpherical tumid papillae, or of a cylindrical fhape, with an obtufe apex. Thefe are interfperfed among the 3d. divifion, the moft numerous and universally prevalent papillae, viz. vilofi or conicae. 4, The more important papillae, however, are thofe which are endowed with peculiar fenfibility to fapid bodies ; they are to be diftinguifhed by their [Superior red* nefs and briliancy upon the point and edges of the tongue. The tongue is inverted with the cuticle and rete mucofum, like the fkin in other parts. The lowey Surface of the tongue is Similar to the general lining membrane of the mouth being a villous and Surface. It is reflected off upon the botto mouth. It forms here the frenulum linguas. This ligament feems evidently intended to limit the motion of the point of the tongue backwards. I believe a very fall'e opinion has much prevailed, that the fhort- nefs of this ligament, or its being continued too far forward toward the point of the tongue, prevents the child from fucking. The tongue, as I conceive, would fufficiently perform the neceflary adtion on the motherâ€™s nipple, although its lower Surface were univerfally ad- hering to the bottom of the mouth. But, obferve the bad confequences which may arife from cutting this frenulum. Secreting 1 of the

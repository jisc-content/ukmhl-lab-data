OF THE HUMAN EAR. 436 It was believed by anatomifts formerly, that the ofleous canals had the pulp of the nerve expanded on their periofteum. But we find, on the contrary, that the membranous tubuli do not touch the bones, but are connected with them by a tranfparent cellular membrane-like mucus. Each of the femicircular mem- branous tubes has one extremity fvvelled out into an ampulla of an oval form, anfwering to the dilated ex- tremity of thofe olfeous tubes which we have already described. Thefe ampulla; have the fame ftructure and ufe with thofe formerly mentioned in defcribing the ear in fillies. When the central belly of thefe tubes is punftured, both the ampulla; and the membranous canals fall flaccid. Befides thofe veflels which we have defcribed running along the periofteum of the cavities of the labyrinth, veflels alfo play upon the facculi and membranous tubes. The ampullae of the tubes are, in a particular manner, fupplied with blood-veflels *. In the cochlea there is alfo a pulpy membrane, independent of the periofteum; but of this I can fay nothing from my own difleftion. * “ Caeterum univerfum hoc canaliculorum membraneorum “ alveique communis machinamentum, fanguiferis vafis inftruitur, ic quorum crafiiora, circum'alveum communem, ferpentino incefiu, “ ludunt; crebra et conferta alia ampulla imprimis recipiunt ob “ quam caufam rubellx plerumque funt et cruore veluti fuffufas.” Scarpa, p. 47.

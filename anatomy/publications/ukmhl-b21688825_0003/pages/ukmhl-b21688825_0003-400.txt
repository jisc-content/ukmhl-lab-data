OF SOUND. 3/6 teeth, teeth is flruck by another folid body *. He obferved in other experiments, that the more fonorous the bo- dies flruck were, the lefs vivid was the impreffion; by which it would appear, that water, though it conveys an impreffion more flrongly to the ear than the air, is not equally adapted to the refonance and variety of tone. Indeed*, this is a â€¢ natural confequence of the water, a fluid of greater denfity being in clofe contact with the founding body, and fuppreffing its vibration. In thefe fads, we /hall find the explanation of fame peculiarities in the flructure of the ears of fiffies. Thus, we fee, that the vibration of a folid body is continued through the air and through water, until reaching the organ of hearing, it produces the fenfa- lion of found. Sound, it will be evident, is alfo com- municated through folids. When we put the ear to one end of a log of wood of thirty feet in length, and ftrike upon the other, we are fenfible of the impreffion; and when a folid body applied to the bones of the head, or to the teeth, is flruck, we are fenfible of the noife f ; and this is felt even by thofe who are deaf to impreffions conveyed through the air : indeed it is partly in this way that we are to judge whether deafnefs may be cured by operation, as depending upon fome injury of the mechanifin of the organ, or whether it be an incurable affection of the nerve or brain itfelf. If the found be perceptible when conveyed through the * Thefe experiments were repeated by Dr. Monro. See his Eook of Fifties. f Perhaps we cannot call this found.

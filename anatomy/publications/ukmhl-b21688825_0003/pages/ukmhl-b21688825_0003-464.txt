OF HEARING IN GENERAL* 44® C H A P. V. OF HEARING IN GENERAL. When aerial undulations were, by the experiments on the air pump, firft proved to be the caufe of founds, philofophers looked no further to the ftrufture of the ear than to difcover an apparatus adapted to the re- ception of fuch vibrations. When they obferved the ftru&ure of the membrane of the tympanum, and its admirable capacity for receiving thefe motions of the atmofphere, they were fatisfied, without confidering the immediate obje&s of fenfation. In the fame way, an ignorant perfon, at this day, would reft fatisfied with the faft that found was received upon the drum £of the ear. But after fo minutely explaining the anatomy of the ear, it becomes us to take a general furvey of a ftrudture the moft beautiful which the mind can contemplate. We cannot fay that it furpafles in beauty the ftru&ure of other parts of the body: but the parts are adapted to each other, in a manner fo fimple, efficient, and perfedt, that we can better un- derftand and appreciate the harmony of their ftrutture than that of organs, which perform their fun&ions by qualities and actions almoft entirely unintelligible to us. We

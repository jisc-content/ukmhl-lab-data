OF THE EYE-UCS. 366 cHAf. mi OF THE EYE-LIDS, OF THEIR GLANDS, AND OF THE COURSE OF THE TEARS. Having completed the defcription of the eye, as the organ of vifion, we have now to attend to its connec- tions, its adventitious membranes, the glands of the eye-lids, and the courfe of the tears. It is plainly ne- ceffary that the eye fhould not be loofe in the focket; but that, in its rolling motion, it lhould Hill be at- tached ; and that, although the delicate anterior fur- face mult be expofed, the internal parts of the focket lhould be defended from the intrufion of extraneous bodies. This is accomplilhed by the tunica con- j undiva. The TUNICA CONJUNCTIVA, 01* ADNATA, is the inflection of the common fkin of the eye-lids. It goes a little way back into the orbit, and is again reflected, fo as to come forward and cover the forepart of the eye-ball. Here it is pellucid, and the white coat of the eye fnines through it. It covers the cornea alfo ; and here it is perfectly tranfparent; loofes its charac- ter of vafcularity, as the conjunctiva ; and is aflimula- ted to the nature of the cornea. As this coat is a con- tinuation of the common integuments, it is, like them, vafcular, and liable to inflammation. The tunica conjunctiva, is the common feat of opthalmia. In the i

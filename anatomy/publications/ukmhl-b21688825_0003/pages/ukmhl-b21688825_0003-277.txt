OF THE COATS OF THE EYE. 253 tiffue; and it has upon its inner furface a pigment, which being fometimes firm, might be taken for a membrane. It was Ruyfch who obferved this divifion of the choroid coat into two laminae ; and the inner one, his fon called the tunica Ruyfchiana: but of thefe hereafter. Thofe anatomifls who fuppofed the fclerotic coat to be the production of the dura mater, naturally con- cluded, that the choroid coat was derived from the pia mater; and as Ruyfch found it to be divifible into two laminae, fo Sladius found the pia mater to confifl of two membranes. It followed, that the one lamina of the choroid coat was the continuation of the tunica arachnoides, and the other of the pia mater ; but this account of thefe membranes has no fupport from ob- fervation. Betwixt the pia mater and choroid coat, there is no refemblance; the latter we fhall find loaded with veffels ; but thefe veffels are peculiar, and mini- fter to a fecreting furface. The pia mater in the brain, and optic nerve, is in flriCt union with the fubflance of the brain, and fupports and nourifhes it; but the choroid coat has no conne&ion with the retina or ex- panded nerve. There can be no better mark of diflinCtion between membranes than their degree of vafcularity, and par- ticularly in the manner of the diflribution of their veffels. The choroid coat is mofl particular in the diflribution of its arteries and veins. The great arte- rial vafcularity of the choroid coat is to be feen only after a very minute injection, and the venous vafcu- larity after artificial or accidental infarction of the blood, or by a fuccefsful injection from the fuperior cava;

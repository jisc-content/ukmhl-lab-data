I THE IOO OF THE VENTRICLES OF THE BRAIN. bercles. The tubercula quadrigemina are not in the cavities or ventricles of the brain, but are feen upon lifting and turning forward the poflerior lobes of the cerebrum from the cerebellum. Thefe four tubercles are behind the third ventricle, and above the fourth. As they are immediately in the center of the brain, they form a kind of commilfure, and they both communicate with the tubercles, from which the traftus opticus emerge. The uppermoft two are the nates, the lower are the testes ; the former are . lefs white than the latter. A little under the in- ferior tubercle, we find fometimes a fmall traÂ£l of me- dullary matter, which extends to the thalami nervorum opticorum, and the crura cerebri. And from the lower part of the teftes there projeCl backwards, connecting itfelf with the crura cerebelli, a thin me- dullary lamina, which is the valvula vieussenii, PROCESSUS a CEREBELLO AD TESTES, Or VELUM IN- terjectum. Behind the poflerior tubercle, or from this medullary lamina itfelf, the fourth pair of nerves take their origin. Sometimes thofe four tubercles are of the fame fize; fometimes the poflerior, fometimes the anterior tubercles, are the larger : a perpendicular fec- tion of them fhows a mutual communication of flrise of medullary and cineritious matter, but thofe are faintly feen only.

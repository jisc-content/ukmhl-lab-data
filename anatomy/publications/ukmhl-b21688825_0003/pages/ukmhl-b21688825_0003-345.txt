OF THE CENTRAL ARTERY. 321 The branches of the arteria centralis retinas, which are diftributed in the retina, are fubfervient to its fup- port, and are confequently as vifible in the adult as in the fcetus; and, where the membrane of the retina has been defcribed as adhering to the point of the ciliary body, thefe veflels of the retina unite to, or inofculate with the veflels of the ciliary procefies. Walter objects to the defcription of the arteria cen- tralis retinas given by Haller and others ; he fays, de- cidedly, that there are no arteries diftributed to the retina, and that anatomifts have deceived themfelves in fuppofmg thofe veflels which ramify on the. retina, to be arteries, when, in reality, they are veins; he con- ceives, that the free return of the injection from the extremities of the arteries into the veins has milled them. I am at a lofs to conceive what notions profeffor Walter can have entertained regarding this vein diftributed in the retina, without an accompanying artery. It is a fuppolition contrary to the general frame of the ceco- nomy, and I would oppofe to it, with confidence, my own experience, fmce, in the ox and other animals, I have feen the veins of the retina turged With blood and exceedingly diftinct j yet when I injedted the trunk of vitreous humor. It does not, he fays, run through the vitreous hu- mor in a ftraight line from behind, forward, nor does it divide into a great number of branches in the poderior part of the capfule of the lens, like radii from a centre, as Zinn has defcribed. He aflerts that the lens receives its veifels from the invefture of the membrana hyoloidea, and that they run back from the edge of the lens towardÂ® the pofterior convexity. the

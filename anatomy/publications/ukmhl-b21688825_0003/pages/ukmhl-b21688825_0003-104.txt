78 OF THE VENTRICLES OF THE BRAIN. part. As the corpus callofum is the continuation of the internal medullary fubflance of the brain, it is fu- perfluous to fay that it is continued down, anteriorly, into the medullary matter betwixt the corpora ftriata, terminating in its pedunculi; or, backwards, that it is continued with the fornix and cornua ammonis and the furface of the poPcerior prolongation of the lateral ventricle. We fee upon the furface of the corpus callofum two medullary lines confiderably raifed, running paral- lel to each other * in the length of the body. Betwixt thefe falient lines there is of courfe a kind of rut, called fometimes the rapha, or future, which may be con- fidered as dividing this body into two equal parts, and which, in truth, forms the accurate divifion of the two fides of the whole brainf. Other lines, lefs elevated from the furface, are to be obferved running acrofs thefe, as if palling from one hemifphere to the other. If the corpus callofum be cut horizontally, and the fedtion be continued into the fubflance of the hemifpheres, we Hill can perceive thofe tranfverfe lines, and obferve them to be loll in the me- dullary matter of the hemifpheres J. The * They are not ftri&ly parallel in all their length; we find them often feparated both upon the fore and back part; but generally more feparated upon the back part, and even fometimes they are curved. -f- In which conceit Duverney calls this “ clef du cerveau,” from its being the centre of communication.

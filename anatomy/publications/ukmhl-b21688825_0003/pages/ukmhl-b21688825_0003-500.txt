476 OF TOUCH AND OF THE SKINâ€™. Betwixt thefe capfules, there is a cellular tifiue, and the fpace is commonly found filled with a bloody fluid. In the bottom of the inner fac, there is a fmail body, called monticule by Buyerney, from which the hair is feen to arife ; and if this is left when the bulb of the hair is pulled out, the hair will be regenerated. The root of the hairs, fays Mr. Window, is covered by a rtrong white membrane, which is connected with the {kin and cellular membrane. Within the root, there is a kind of glue, fome fine filaments of which advance to form thp flem which pafles through the (mail e tremity of the bulb to the fkin. As the {lem pafles through the root, the outer membrane is elongated in form of a tube, which clofely inverts the ftem and is entirely united with it. And many authors agree, that the hair does not perforate the cutticle, but takes from it merely a vagina which accompanies it. RETE MUCOSUM, The rete or corpus mucofum, lies betwixt the cutticle and the furface of the true {kin. It is a mucous layer, pervaded by the little fibrillre pafling betwixt the fkin and cutticle. I confider it as a foft bed to envelope and preferve the papillae of the flcin, and as intended to become cutticle in due fucceflion. It was confidered, by Albinus, as of a nature adapted to imbibe the fluids through the cutticle, and as a production of the epi- dermis. M. Meckel believed it to be only a mucous fluid, infpiflated into the form of a membrane; and that it was diflfolved by putrefaction, while the fkin and cutticle remained firm. If is the feat of colour in the

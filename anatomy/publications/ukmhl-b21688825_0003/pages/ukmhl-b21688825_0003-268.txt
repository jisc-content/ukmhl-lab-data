244 OF THE COATS OF THE EYE. OF CHAP. II. OF THE COATS OF THE EYE. Speaking generally, and without confidering the minuter divifions of anatomifts, we may fay, that there are three proper coats of the eye, viz. the sclerotic coat, giving ftrength ; the choroid coat, being the vehicle of the chief vafcular ftrufture of the eye ; and the retina, or expanded nerve, being the organ it- felf. Thefe are the proper coats of the eye ; but there are others which may be called the partial or acceffory coats, being thofe which do not completely furround the eye, viz. the albuginea and conjunctiva *. There are others, dill, which are called capfular coats; and thefe are the tranfparent tunics which immediately furround the humors, as the capfule of the lens and pellucid membrane of the vitricus humor. Although many of thefe coats may be capable of being divided by the art of the anatomift, either by the knife, by inje&ions, which form extravafation between their layers, by maceration, or by the chemical aftion of fluids ; yet it is better, in a general enumeration, to take a natural divifion and character, than to enume- rate their feveral lamina. * Colombier Sandifort Thef.

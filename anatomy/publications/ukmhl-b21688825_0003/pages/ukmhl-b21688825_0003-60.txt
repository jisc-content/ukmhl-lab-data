4Â® OF THf VEINS OF THE BRAIN, or of the kidney, the difference would have been Iefs finking. Wherever there is great arterial vafcularity, we are fure to find alio peculiarities in the venous fyftem of the part; wherever we find an accumulation of tortuous arteries palling to a gland, we fhall alfo find the veins tortuous and large; or wherever the arteries of a part take a difeafed adlion, the effect of this adtion will be found mofl perceptible in the change which the veins undergo. In fhort, the effect of difeafe is much more furely to be difcovered in the venous than in the arterial fyftem ; and no where is this better exemplified than in the brain. The following appear on the firfl view .to be the mofi; ftriking peculiarities in the veins of the brain; their fize; the little connection they feem to have with the furrounding cellular membrane; and the incon- fiderable fupport which they appear to receive from it; their having no valves; their being in their courfe diftindt from the arteries ; and laftly, their not being gathered into great trunks, but emptying themfelves into the finufes of the dura mater. It is not eafy to conceive how the veins of the brain fhould have been fo much overlooked by the older anatomifts j but from the diffedlions ,of Albinus, and the microfcopical obfervations of Leeuwenhoek, we have authority for what is, perhaps, in itfelf fufficiently evi- dent, that the veins of the furface of the brain are derived from minute ramifications conveyed in the de- licate pia mater ; and that thefe, as in the other parts of the body, proceed from the extremities of the arteries, without any apparent peculiarity in the ccnnedtion be- 6 ' twixt

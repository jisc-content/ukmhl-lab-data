OF THE VEINS OF THE BRAIN-. 69 The more general idea conceived of the life of the finufes is nearer the truth; viz. to prevent the hid- den and violent action of the mufcles of refpiration, or of the mufcles of the head and neck, from repelling the blood into the vena cava, or internal jugular veins; and confequently preventing the impulfe from being communicated to the blood in the fmall and tender veins of the brain, which might endanger a rupture of them*. Yet this is not exactly the manner in which the finufes preferve the leffer veins; they do not fuffo- cate nor take off the force of the impulfe from the re- gurgitating blood, fo much as they would do if they were like the trunks of veins in other parts; becaufe, being incapable of diftention, they throw the undula- tion of the blood, when it is thus checked in its exit, backwards upon the extremities of the veins. But then the effect is, that no particular vein or trunk receives the fhock; all fuffer in a leffer degree, and equally, which is their fafety. All the veins in the bafe of the brain, which would be liable to rupture, or diftention, from receiving, in their fudden turns, the fliock of the blood, checked by the mufcles of refpira- tion, or otherwife, are preferved by being inclofed in finufes, and covered by the ftrong lamellae of the dura mater. The leffer veffels again are removed from the fliock: its force is fpent, becaufe it has fpread among many branches; and it has become a general impulfe upon the brain, which the brain refills, becaufe it is imcompreffible, * Monro, Nervous Syftem, p. 4, That

23Â° or the eTe. We fee, then,_the operation of a double convex glafs,in forming the image of a luminous body upon a furface. If, for example, fuch a glafs be held be- tween a candle and a piece of white paper, (the dif- tances being properly ad- juded), the image of the . candle will appear very didinclly upon the oppof- ed furface, but inverted ; beeaufe the rays coming from the point a fig. 5., converge at c, and thofe from the point b at d. Before proceeding farther in this Ihort expofition of the principles of optics, it will be neceffary to take a very flight view of the dru&ure of the eye. SIMPLE IDEA OF THE STRUCTURE OF THE EYE. The eye being that organ by which we are fenfible to the rays of light, may be confidered as confiding of two parts; that which receives the impreffion, viz. the retina or expanded nerve, and which is indeed the^ organ of the fenfe ; and the tunics and humors, the apparatus by which the rays of light are made capable of forming an impreffion on the retina, or proper organ of the fenfe. In an anatomical enquiry, it is chiefly the latter di~ vifion of the fubject which mud occupy our attention y for.

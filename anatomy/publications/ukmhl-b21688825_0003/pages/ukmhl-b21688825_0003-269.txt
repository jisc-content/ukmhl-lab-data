OF THE COATS OF TIIE EYE. 245 of vol. in. s OF THE SCLEROTIC COAT. The fclerotic coat is fo called from its hai'dnefs *. The fclerotica and cornea are often confidered as one continued coat inverting the eye ; hence they fay, the opaque and the lucid cornea. But, although thefe parts are actually in union, yet as they are really of fo very different a nature, we muff confider them apart, and treat at prefent only of the opaque white fclerotic coat. The fclerotic coat is a ftrong, firm, and white mem- brane, confiding of lamellae firmly attached and hr-' terwoven, and not capable of being regularly fepaiated by maceration; it has the denfenefs of tanned leather. In firmnefs, whitenefs, opacity, and the little appearance of vafcularity, it more refembles the dura mater than any other membrane of the body. In adults, the fclerotic coat is rtronger and firmer, comparatively, than in the foetus ; the cornea lefs fo. On the outer furface, it has (towards the orbit) a loofe cellular membrane attached to it, which allows the motion of the eye-ball. Upon the fore part, it is in- verted by the tunica albuginea or tendinea. Upon its inner furface, it has a loofe and foft membrane which connects it with the choroid coat. In birds, and the tortoife, the porterior part of the fclerotic coat is thin; the fore part of it is fplit into laminae, betwixt which there are interpofed thin plates * Dura feu fclerotica; Vefalius, Ruyfch, &c.

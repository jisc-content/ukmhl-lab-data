344 DISTANCE OF OBJECT'S. near and to diftant objects. In thefe experiments, the motion of the cornea became its furface remained in a line with a wire which crofted the glafs of the micrcfcope when the eye was adj idled to the diftant objedts, but projected confiderably beyond it when adapted to the near ones, and the fpace through which it moved was fo great as readily to be meafured by magnifying the divifions on the fcale, and comparing them. In this way, it was eftinlated that it moved the 800 part of an inch (a fpace diftindtly feen in a micrcf- cope magnifying 30 times), in the change from the neareft point of difdnct vifion to the diflance of 90 feet. In the evidence from anatomical ftruchire, I cannot think Mr. Home fo happy. He was defirous of de- termining, more accurately than had hitherto been done, the precife infertion of the tendons of the four ftraight mufcles, fo as to know whether their adtion could be extended to the cornea or not: he found them to approach within -1 of the cornea before their tendons became attached to the fclerotic coat. But he did not flop hereâ€”he Itripped off with them the anterior lamina of the cornea. Now, as it is fuppofed, in thefe experiments, that the adtion of the redd mufcles upon the Tides and back part of the ball comprefles the humors, and makes them flow forward fo as to diftend the cornea ; if the extremities of the tendons be inferted into the edge of the cornea and even pafs over it, as Mr. Home has demonftrated, their effedt would be; to flatten the cornea, by drawing out and extending its margin. This is a circumftance which Dr. Monro has remarked ; and Dr. Monro has alfo, with more accu-. racy

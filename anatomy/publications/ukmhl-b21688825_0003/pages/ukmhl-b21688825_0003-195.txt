OF THE PARTICULAR NERVES. I 69 this union forms a firm ganglion. Sometimes there run out in this direction two fhort branches from the fpinal nerve, to unite with the ganglion of the fympa- thetic ; but more commonly there paffes in a retro- grade direction from the intercoftal nerve, where it is about to take its courfe between the ribs, another branch of communication which joins the fympathetic. Sometimes the dorfal or intercoftal nerves fend off three communicating branches to the fympathetic. The intercoftal nerves pafs on betwixt the ribs, in company with the intercoftal arteries, and reach even to the fternum. In this courfe they fupply the inter- coftal mufcles and triangularis fterni, while they are at the fame time fending out branches, which, piercing the intercoftal mufcles and fafcia of the thorax, are diftri- buted to the mufcles on the outfide of the cheft.â€”- Thofe branches which we mentioned as palling betwixt the heads of the ribs, and which are fent off immedi- ately upon the trunk efcaping from the vertebral open- ing, fupply the multifidus fpinae and levatores cofta- rum, and other extenfor mufcles of the fpine. Slips proceeding from the fecond, third, fourth, and fifth intercoftal nerves, fend branches to the pedtoral muf- cles, the ferratus anticus, and ferratus pofticus fupe- rior, trapezius, and romboides. The fixth, and all the lower nerves of the back, fend branches from betwixt the ribs to the latiflimus dorfi, ferratus inferior, and abdominal mufcles. The eleventh and twelfth are dis- tributed to the diaphragm, quadratus lumborum, pfoas magnuSj and iliacus internus. LUMBAR

OF THE SECRETION OF TEARS. 371 Ing out the motes and dull from the eye, and for guarding the punfta from the abforption of fuch littl# particles as might irritate or obllruft them. In birds, the valvula femilunaris is drawn, by a mufcle and fmall tendon inferted into it, quite acrofs the eye, fo as to aft like a third eye-lid ; it is in them called membrana niftitans. The lachrymal sac and duct lie in the cÂ§ unguis or lachrymale. The facculus is a bag of an oblong or oval figure; it is funk into the folfa of the os unguis, and defended by the frontal procefs of the fuperior maxillary bone; and it is covered by the ligamentous connexion of the orbicularis mufcle. This fac is the dilated upper end of the nafal duft; and into it the two canaliculi lachrymales (the extre- mities of which are the punfta), open as diftinft tubes *. 1 Two coats are defcribed as covering the lachrymal fac ; a nervous, white, external coat; and a vafcular, pulpy, pituitary membrane. This fac diminilhing to- wards the lower part, and being received into the complete canal of the bone, becomes the nafal duft. Taking a courfe downward and backward, it opens into the nofe under the inferior fpongy bone. The lachrymal fac and duft are by forne conceived to be mufcular, fo as to enable them to convey the tears into the nofe; or it may be conceived, that they aft like a fyphon, the duft reaching down into the nofe acting like the long leg of the fyphon, and drawing the tears in at the openings of the punfta.

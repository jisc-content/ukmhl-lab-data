I 21 THE ORIGIN OF THE NERVES. arifes fometimes by two filaments, but more commonly by one undivided root *. This root is feen to emerge from a point betwixt the medullary lamina of the cere* bellum, or valvula VieufTenii, and the lower of the tuber- cula quadrigemina f. From the connections of the parts whence this nerve arifes with the reft of the brain, it is prefumed, that this fourth pair of nerves has a very immediate and univerfal connection with the internal parts of the brain ; yet there is nothing in the final diftribution of the nerve, which fhould incline us to believe that there fhould be any particular provifion in its origines. FIFTH PAIR OF NERVES ; TRIGEMINI. The fifth nerve of the brain arifes from the fore and lowed part of the crura cerebelli, where they unite with the pons varolii. The origin of this nerve may be divided into two portions : an anterior is frnall, and fomewhat elevated above the other. The poflerior part of this origin takes its rife a little lower than the anterior part. * Santorini fays, they have three roots or little fafciculi. Wrif- berg following Vieufens, fays, the fourth pair arifes from the valvula cerebri. Vicq d’Azyr. See Haller, faf. vii. tab. 3. “ Origo alius “ fimplex eft, alius duplex ; quando ftmplex eft, a proceffu a. cere- “ bello ad teftes exterius prodit, quam eft tranfverfa ftria, quae eos “ proceffus conjungit.” Haller Phyf. vol, iv. p. 208. f “ Et fouvent ils fe confondent avec un traftus medullaire place “ tranfverfalement au-deffus de la valvule du cerveau.” Vicq d’Azyr. This nerve, fays he, cannot be followed into the anterior part of the brain from its extreme delicacy, and becaufe it is formed from the medullary fubftance itfelf, without the admixture of f.laments to give it ftrength. He quotes thofe words of Soemmerring ;—“ Continua “ medulla oritur.” Thefe

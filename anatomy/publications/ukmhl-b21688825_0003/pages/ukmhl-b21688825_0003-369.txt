DISTANCE OF OBJECTS. 345 racy of obfervation, found “ all the tendinous fibres of the redid mufcles firmly attached to the fclerotic coat at the diftapce of a quarter of an inch from the cornea, and no appearance that any part of them, or that any membrane prcfcfuced by them, is continued over the cornea.” Amongft the variety of opinions, the innumerable ingenious but contradictory experiments for difcover- ing the manner in which the eye adapts itfelf to the diflance of objects, I am, for my own part, much at a lofs to determine which I fhould prefer. I have often doubted, whether thefe experimenters were not in fearch of the explanation of an effect which has no exigence. I have never been able to determine, why a very flight degree of convexity in the cornea of a fhort-fighted eye fhould be fo permanent during a whole life-time, notwithflanding the perfedt elaflicity of the cornea, and its being fo adapted as to alter its convexity by the adtion of the mufcles. Again, a near- fighted perfon, with the affiftance of a concave gluts', can command the objedts to the diftance of fome miles, and with the glafs flill held to his eye, can fee minute objedts within three inches of the eye. Now, I cannot conceive how the concave glafs fhould give fo great a range to the fight: as there can be no change in the glafs, it mull be the eye which adapts itfelf to the variety of diftances; yet, without the glafs, it cannot .command the perfedt vifion of objedts for a few feet. Again, a fhort-fighted perfon fees an oojedt diftindtly at tffree inches diflant from his eye; at 12 feet, lefs diftindtly; and when he looks upon the objedt at 13 feet, the objedts beyond it are confufed, juft as in other A a 3 men’s 1

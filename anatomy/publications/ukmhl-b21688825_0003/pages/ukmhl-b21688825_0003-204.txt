178 OF THE PARTICULAR NERVES. fcribingthe dorfal nerves,) through all its courfe in the thorax, has additional branches from the dorfal or in- tercoftal nerves. It forms alfo, while it is lying on the fide of the vertebras, a divifion in the thorax, which it will be important to recoiled. This nerve is fent more forwards upon the body of the vertebrae, and pafles into the abdomen betwixt the crura of the dia- phragm ; while the trunk of the fympathetic continues its courfe by the heads of the ribs, pafles under the ligamentum arcuatum, and downwards upon the lum-. bar vertebrae. The splanchnic nerve, then,is this anterior branch of the fympathetic in the thorax. It is the great nerve of the vifcera of the abdomen. It generally has two or four roots from the trunk of the fympathetic nerve, where it is oppofite to the fixth, feventh, and eighth intercoftal nerves. It is feen lying under the pleura, and palling obliquely over the bodies of the lumbar vertebras, from the feventh to the tenth. It then pafles betwixt the crura of the diaphragm, enters the abdo- men, and forms the great femilunar ganglion. One or more branches are fent forward from the fympathetic, commonly from the ganglions, oppofite to the interftice betwixt the ninth and tenth, or tenth and eleventh ribs. Thefe alfo pafs the diaphragm, and unite with the femilunar ganglion. There is, how- ever, a confiderable variety to be obferved both in the origines of the fplanchnic nerve, and in the number of thefe fubfidiary branches. A larger branch, going off betwixt the tenth and eleventh ribs, is fo common, that it has the name of splanchnicus minor, or, ACCESSORIUS, /

112 OF THE VENTRICLES OF THE BRAIN. foramen it is united firmly to the ligament. Under this, however, it forms a feparate tube. The tunica arachnoides again adheres loofely, having a kind of fe- cretion within it, while the pia mater clofely embraces, and is intimately united to the medullary matter. From betwixt the ninth nerve and vertebal artery to the fecond and third lumbar nerve, there is a mem- braneous connexion betwixt the lateral part of the fpinal marrow and the dura mater of the fpine. From the manner of its connexion to the dura mater, by dif- tindt flips irregular and pointed, it is called the Liga- mentum Denticulatum, or Dentatum. SCHEME AND GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE ORI- GINES OF THE NERVES OF THE ENCEPHALON AND SPINE. In enumerating the nerves which pafs from the cra- nium, I fliall keep to the old way of Willis, counting only nine nerves of the encephalon. I do not find that the fubdivifions of the nerves in this claffification, and the defcription of the feveral fafciculi, of which the pairs of nerves are compcfed, caufe intricacy. It rather, I am from experience convinced, connects fome circum- Itances with many of the pairs of nerves thus enume- rated, to which the memory of the ftudent can attach. The common enumeration feems a natural one 5 it ferves well the purpofe of difledtion, and confequently will never be entirely exploded. The ufe of new clafli- fications and arrangements, and names, whilft we muff alfo retain the old, adds much to the intricacy of de- monftration. From

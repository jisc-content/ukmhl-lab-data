tB8 Ot THE PARTICULAR SERVES. The higheft of thefe nerves proceed from betwixt the fourth and fifth cervical vertebrae; the laft from be- twixt the firffc and fecond dorfal vertebrae. They pafs out betwixt the middle and anterior divifion of the fca- leni; and even while covered by thefe mufcles, and be- fore they have proceeded far from their foramina, the laft nerve of the neck and firft of the back unite *.— The plexus is continued from above the clavicle to the edge of the tendon of the latiflimus dorfi. It allows of no natural divifion. The axillary nerve palfes for fome way clofe under it, and then perforates betwixt the divifions which form the radial nerve. From the axillary plexus proceed thefe nerves: 1. The thoracic nerves. 2. The fupra and infra fcapular nerves. 3. The circumflex, or articular nerve. 4. The perforans cafierii, or external cutaneous nerve. 5. The radial nerve. 6. The ulnar nerve. 7. The mufcular fpiral nerve. 8. The internal cutaneous nerves'. 1. The thoracic nerves. Although the nerves- which fupply the mufcles of the cheft are derived from the intercoftal nerves, as we have feen, yet there alfo * Before the nerves which form the plexus intermix their filaments, or are connected together, they fend off fmall branches to the fcaleric mufcles, to the mufcles of the fpine, and to the levator fcapulae.— The branches which they give to the fympathetic nerve, we have already noticed. pafs

OF THE PARTICULAR NERVES. 201 thofe to the mufcles lying on the fore-part of the thigh. Thefe diverge fuddenly into innumerable twigs, and are entangled with the branches of the arteries, and follow them in their dillribution. There can be no excufe for bellowing particular names on thefe branches;—■ to fay that one is the branch to the pe&inalis, an- other the branch to the fartorius, another to the re&uSj, &c. is fufficient. OBTURATOR NERVE. This nerve arifes by fafciculi from the fecond and third lumbar nerves, and fometimes by a fmall twig from the fourth. It is formed, however, chiefly by the third lumbar nerve. It then lies under the internal border of the pfoas magnus. It defcends into the pel- vis, and goes obliquely downwards to pafs through the ligamentous membrane which fills up the thyroid hole. The obturator nerve, before it efcapes from the pelvis, fends off a branch which, accompanying the pa- rent nerve, is given to the external obturator mufcle. When it has efcaped from the pelvis, this nerve lies before the heads of the triceps, and behind the pe&i- nalis mufcle ; and it here divides into two branches in the very middle and internal flefh of the thigh. The anterior of thefe branches paflfes down betwixt the ad- ductor mufcles, or heads of the triceps, fupplies thofe mufcles and the gracilis, and fends a branch of com- munication with the faphenus nerve. The pofterior divifion goes down betwixt the adduClor magnus and brevis, fends branches to the obturator externus and addu&or brevis, and continues its courfe downward be- fore the great flefhy partition of the adductor mufcles, and

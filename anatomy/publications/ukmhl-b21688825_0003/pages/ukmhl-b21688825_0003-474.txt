So morbidly acute does the fenfation fometimes become, that the flighted motion of the head will excite a fenfation like the ringing of a great bell clofe to the ear *.

In apopledtic affedtions, with faultering of fpeech and blindnefs, there is alfo deafnefs; becaufe the affedtion of the brain is general. With a paralytic date of the mufcles of the face, there is deafnefs of the correfponding ear, if the affedtion of the nerve be near the brain; which is explained by the ftridt connedtion betwixt the auditory nerve and the nervus communicans faciei. From obferving the courfe of the nervus communicans faciei through the temporal bone, and its connedtions in the tympan'um, we under- ftand why, in violent tooth-ach and in the tic douleu- reufe, we find the euftachean tube and root of the tongue affedted.

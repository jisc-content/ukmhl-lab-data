ANATOMY OF THE HUMORS. 331 which have long been corrected. With this, alfo, I think ought to have been forgotton, the idea of the rifing of the lens after it has been deprefled by the ca- taraft floating in the humors.—The fact I am confident is this : when, after transfixing the cataraft, we en- .deavour to diflodge it by deprefling the point of the needle, we feparate the adhefion between the humors and the points of the ciliary procefles; we do not, however, unfocket the lens from the fore part of the vitreous humor, but when the lens defcends with the point of the needle, from before the pupil, the vitreous humor revolves with it; the confequence of which is, that when the needle is withdrawn, the lens rolls round with the vitreous humor : but as the lens only is opaque as its firm connexion with the vitreous humor, and even the rolling of the vitreous humor itfelf cannot be feen, this rolling of the lens appears to be the con- fequence merely of its own buoyancy in the aqueous humor. This adhefion of the lens to the vitreous hu- mor, I have been fenfible of during its deprefiion, from the elaftic nature of the refiflance which I felt. When the lens parts from its focket in the vitreous humor, and when it is deprefled with fuch a turn of the needle as puts it under the anterior part of the vitreous humor, it cannot rife again ; there is no motion of the eye which can replace it—there is no aqueous fluid in which, if it were of lefs fpecific gravity, it could rife : it lies under and, in part, imbedded in the vitreous humor. Another idea is, that it rifes with the needle: but no one, who underftands what is to be done in the operation of the needle, will raife it again oppofite to the pupil after the Z 4 lens

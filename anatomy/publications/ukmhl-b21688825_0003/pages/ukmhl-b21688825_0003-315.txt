291 OF THE RETINA. The amaurofis is a total blindnefs, while there is a tranfparency of the humors and coats of the eye. Am- blyopia is, on the contrary, only a partial privation of fight, with a pellucid ftate of the eye. Commencing cataradls and opacities of the cornea, and of the humors in general, give occafion to fpots and obfcurities in the vifion *; but we have at prefent to confider thofe only which depend on the ftate of the nerve f. Errors of vifion are not eafily to be diftinguifli- ed from thofe of the imagination proceeding from the brain. Error opticus, or Hallucinacio, from delirium : fimul contorto et liefo, fpiritufque viforii tranfitu impedito, oculot vifione privari contingit, atque inde provenire diligente examine & *onfideratione invenimus.” Platerus Prax. lib. i. c. 7. * Caligo is an obfeurity in the vifion, depending on obftruc- tion to the rays, from opacities before the pupil. “ Catar acta ©pacitas eft ultra pupillam.” Amblyopia and Amaurosis are ©ccafioned by the difeafe of the nerve, or confufion from the focal powers of the humors without opacity of any part. But Cullen ex- tends the genus caligo to all obfcurities caufed by opacity : he in- troduces the words u ob repagulum opacum, inter objeCta & reti- nam,” while Sauvage has the expreffion “ repagulum opacum citra pupillam.” f Pseudoblopsis is thus defined by Dr. Cullen: “ Vifus de- pravatus ita ut quie non exiftant homo fe videre imaginatur vel quse cxiftunt aliter videt ac revera fe habeant”—under this genus is suffusio, phantasma. Under this definition all deceptions from refraction of the rays are naturally comprehended, as well as from the imagination fimply : a definition comprehending defefts of vifion which proceed from caufes fo very diftindt, is an obftrudion to the knowledge of difeafes. Sauvage has it claffed with the vefanise, viz. (Jr, fuffufio, hallucinatio vifus circa obje&a. one

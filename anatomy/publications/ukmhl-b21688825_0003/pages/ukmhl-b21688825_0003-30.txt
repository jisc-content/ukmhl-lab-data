OF THE MEMBRANES OF THE BRAIN. IO fquamas. It is to be regretted that anatomids Ihould have been proud of fuch difledions, or that any fuch defcriptions ihould be thought creditable to their authors, or difcoverers as they are called. The dura mater is infenfible; it has, in the way of experiment, been pricked and injured by every poffibte contrivance, by mechanical and by chemical ftimulants; yet the animals, the fubjeds of fuch cruel experiments, have given no fign of pain*'. Before this fad of the infenfibility of the dura mater was. thus eltabiifhed, phyficians regarded this membrane as the feat and origin of many difeafes f. Formerly the natural connection of the fcull and dura mater was fo refolutely denied—fo hotly con- tefled among the various parties in anatomy and furgery, that we might, by reading their difputes, almod doubt one of the plained and mod obvious fads, were not the clofenefs of this connedion diffidently proved by the manner of the original formation of the cranium, by the reddance to the tearing up of the cranium, and by the bleeding furface of the dura mater ; or, if further proof be required, we may macerate thefe bones and their membranes in acids, when the laminae of the dura mater will be feen intinuftely conneded with the bone, while the pericranium and outer laminae of the dura mater are feen to be continued into each otherby * Zinn.

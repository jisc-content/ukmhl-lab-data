OF THE EARS OF ANIMALS. 379 humors; how the humors are fubfervient to the con- centration of the rays of light, and aflifh their impulfe upon the retina : fo, in the fame manner, in explain- ing the flrudture of the ear, we need not inveftigate the philofophy of found, nor the nature of thofe im- preflions which are made by it on the fenforium through the nerves ; our views are limited to the ftru&ure of the earâ€”we have to obferve the mecha-, nifm by which the ftrength of vibrations is increafed and conveyed inward to the feat of the fenfe, and the manner in which the nerve is expanded to receive fo delicate an impreffion. The method of fludying this fubjedt, which is at once the muft inllrudlive and the molt ainufing, is to trace the various gradations, in the perfection cf the organ, through the feveral dalles of animals. It is chiefly by comparing the ftrudture of the vifcera, and the or- gans of fenfe in animals and in man, that comparative anatomy is ufeful in elucidating the animal oeconomy. For example, in the fligmata and air-velfels of infetts and worms; in the gills of filhes; in the fimple cel- lular flrudlure of the lungs of amphibias; in the more complicated flrudture of the lungs of birds; we ob- ferve one elfential requifite through the whole gra- dation, viz. the expofure of the circulating fluids to the adlion of the air. And in this variety of confor- mation, we fee the fame effedt fo modified as to cor- refpond with the habits and neceflities of the feveral clalfes of animals. In the fame manner, with regard to the circulating fyftem, we are taught the explana- tion of the double heart in the human body, by tracing the variety of ftrudlure through the feveral clalfes of C c 4 animals j

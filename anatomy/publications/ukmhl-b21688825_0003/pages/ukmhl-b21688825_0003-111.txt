OF THE VENTRICLES OF THE BRAIN. 85 the G3 The hippocampos is narrow at its commencement in the pofterior crus of the fornix * ; but it is enlarged as it defcends, following the courfe of the inferior prolongation of the lateral ventricle towards the bafe of the brain. It is, indeed, merely a relief or parti- cular convexity of the floor of this lower horn of the ventricle, like a pad. The inferior extremities of the hippocampi on each fide turn inwards, pointing to the crura cerebri, and taking thus a curve like a ram’s hornf. In its whale extent the hippocampos confifts of an internal cineritious fubltance, and a fuperficial layer of white medullary matter j. The TENIA HIPPOCAMPI, or CORPUS FIMBRIATUM, is the prolonged margin of the fornix : it is merely the thin edge of the hippocampos, which follows in the whole of its circuit, and terminates in an acute point near its bulbous extremity. * In fpeaking of the origin of the hippocampos as from the fornix, I mean Amply that the ftudent having gained the knowledge of one part of the brain may trace the others from their relation to it, and that, underftanding the fituation and relation of the fornix, he traces its crura until he finds them terminating in the hippocampos. We might fully as well fay that the hippocampi are formed from the pofterior part of the corpus callofum, for they are the fame me- dullary matter continued. •]■ Betwixt the extreme point of the hippocampi and the crura cerebri (when the bafe of the brain is ^turned up) we can infinuate the probe into the inferior horn of the lateral ventricle without piercing the fubftance of the brain, but merely tearing the pia mater. ± “ Vers la partie inferieure et pofterieure du corps calleux, on “ trouve, de chaque cote, un petit bourrclet dc fubftance grife qui fe “ prolcnge dan61’epaifleur del’hypocampe dont il fait partie: cebour- “ relet eft recuvert dans fon principe par une lame de fubftance “ blanche.” Vicq d’Azvr, loc. cit.

' The laxator tympani runs in a fiflure of the tem- poral bone on the outfide of the euftachean tube, and is inferted into the long procefs of the malleus. The tensor tympani f runs alfo by the fide of the euftachean tube; it is inferted into the body of the malleus; it is a long and flender mufcle. The exter- nal or fuperior J mufcle of the malleus, which is de- nied by fome anatomifts to be of the nature of mufcle, comes down from the upper part of the tympanum, and is fixed by a fmall tendon to the neck of the malleus. The stapedius |j is the fmalleft mufcle, and is at- tached to the fmalleft bone. It has a fmall round flefhy belly, taking its origin from the rough fide of the tympanum, and is inferted by a fmall round tendon into the head of the (tapes. As all thefe mufcles are inferted either into the malleus or (tapes, and not into the middle bone, it would appear that their operation is chiefly upon the membranes of the tympanum, and of the foramen ovale, through the medium of the bone immediately attached to them. * Mufculus-proceffus minimi mallei.

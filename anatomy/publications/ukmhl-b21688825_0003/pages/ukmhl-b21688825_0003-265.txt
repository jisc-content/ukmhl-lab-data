OF THE EYE. 24S Jurin illuftrates this opinion, and its application to our prefent purpofe, in this manner. Suppofe that a b d, and b d f, are mediums of different denfity, and that their furfaces are in- terceded by the line b d ; again, let a be a pencil of rays, which, iffuing from this point, falls upon b a d, as the refracting furface b a d is convex, and no two points of it, from a to d, are equally diftant from the fource of the rays a ; and, as the rays of light, in their pro- grefs, alter alternately from the fit of refra&ion to the fit of reflection, they mull be in part re- fraCted to the focus f, and reflected in the direction of the dotted lines c e. Thus, if the ray a a happens to be in difpofition to pafs through the medium b d f, it will pafs on towards the point f. If the next ray a b fhould be in no fit to be tranfmitted, becaufe, being in a degree farther ad- vanced from its fource a, it has changed to the fit of reflection, then it will not be refraCted towards the focus f, but reflected off towards c; but, again, the ray ' a d being advanced farther from its fource, it will Impinge upon the furface B d, during its difpofition to

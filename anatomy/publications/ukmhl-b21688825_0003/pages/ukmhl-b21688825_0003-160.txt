134 OF THE PARTICULAR NERVES. fphenoid bone. They pafs forward in the orbit, un- diminiffied by the giving off of branches; and are each finally diftributed to the fuperior oblique mufcle or trochlearis. Sometimes, however, in their courfe, they fend branches to unite with thofe of the fifth pair, which pafs to the nofe, or even to the frontal nerve j but this is very rare As this nerve is derived very far back from the brain, and as the parts from which it originates are lefs axfe&ed by the dillention of the ventricles than almoft any other part of the brain, this may be a reafon why- in hydrocephalus we fo frequently fee the eyes turned obliquely towards the nofe. The origins of thefe nerves being lefs affe&ed, they will give a compara- tively greater power to the fuperior oblique mufcle. It has been obferved alfo, that in death the power of the fuperior oblique mufcle has a preponderance, THE FIFTH PAIR, OR TRIGEMINI. The tracing of the branches of the fifth pair, by diffection, is a difficult talk, for thofe branches are diftributed among the bones of the face, to the eyes, nofe, mouth, tongue, and throat. From this extenfive diftribution the fifth nerve is neceffarily the largelt of thofe that pafs out of the cranium. It is of a flattened form f; it penetrates the dura mater at the anterior point of the petrous bone, and fpreads flat under it. Here, under the dura mater, it. is matted into one irregular ganglion; viz. the femp * Soemmerring, f So it ig faid, by Miekel, to refemble the flat worm, or ttenia. lunar.

50 OF THE VEINS OF THE BRAIN. fets of arteries pafs up to the plexus choroides, from the bafe betwixt the crura of the brain; they come, i ft, from the curve of the internal carotid artery ; 2d, from the communication betwixt the baftlar and carotid artery ; 3d, from the bafilar artery, and moft pofterior part of the branch of communication. Thefe arteries, which are fmall, are convoluted into great minute- nefs # in the membrane, and their blood is returned by veins, which taking a very tortuous courfe, feem to entangle their branches, and form a mefh of veins. The blood of the two plexus of the lateral ventricles, and that of the third, is conveyed into the velum inter- pofitum, or that membrane which ftretches under the fornix, and over the third ventricle. The branches of veins alfo which extend themfelves upon the ftdes of the. lateral ventricles, and into the proceflus digitalis, being gathered together upon this membrane, open into the vena galeni, or rather form it. The moft remarkable branches of veins in the lateral ventricle are thefe: A conftderable branch is feen to colled its branches upon the anterior part of the ven- tricle, and in the anterior finus, or horn of the ventricle. This vein runs back towards the anterior crus of the fornix, and dips under it, juft above the communication of the ventricles; and joins the veins in the velum of Haller. Other fmall veins are feen colleding their branches upon the corpora ftriata ; and, palling un- der the centrum femi-circulare geminum, conned : * “ Huncce p'exum nil efle nifi arteriolas, ad vifum fuccofas, a “ natural! oonftitutione arteriofa non nihil recedentes,.mirumque in “i modum eontortas, ferpentinoque modo reptantes, glandulafquc ,l repre^entantes.,, Ruyfch, Thef.v.

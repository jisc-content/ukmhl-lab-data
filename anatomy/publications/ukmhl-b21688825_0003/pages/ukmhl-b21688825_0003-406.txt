382 OF THE EARS OF ANIMALS. conveying thofe general vibrations to the expanded nerve. There is in every ear, adapted to hearing under water, a bone or concretion, placed fo as to vaccilate eafily, and which is deftined to agitate the fluid in which it is fufpended with a ftronger vibration than could be produced merely by a general impulfe. Befides this proviflon in fiflies, there is a very elegant ftru&ure for ftill further encreafmg the furface deftined to receive the impulfe, and for expofing to that im- pulfe or vibration a larger proportion of the expanded nerve. It confifts of three femicircular tubes, which penetrate widely within the bones of the head. They are filled with a fluid, and have in their extremities a divifion of the nerve which is moved or otherwife affect- ed by the vibration of the fluids contained within the tubes. There is a flight variety, however, in the ear of car- tilaginous fifties. In the head of the skate, for ex- ample, there is under the fldn, at the back of the head, a membrane extended acrofs a pretty regular opening. This, however, is not confidered as the opening of the ear; but a paflage, like a mucous duÂ£t, which is befide it, has given occafion to a controverfy between Pro- feffors Scarpa and Monro ; and it may not be out of place to enquire a little into this difputed point. We have feen that water conveys the found of vi- brating bodies with a Ihock almoft intolerable to the ear, and with a particular and diftinft fenfation over the whole body. We fee, alfo, that, in the greater number of fiflies, there is confefledly no external opening, the whole organ is placed under the fquamous bones of the head. Yet 9

OF THE PARTICULAR NERVES. I4I other forms one of the roots of the great fympathetic nerve, by joining the branch of the fixth pair, which paffes down with the carotid artery. From the diftribution of this branch of the fifth pair to the membrane of the nofe, and its connection with the fympathetic, fome phyfiologifts account for the effeCts of odours in caufing fainting, as the chief nerves of the heart are received from the fympathetic. They alfo account thus for the excitement of the heart, in de- liquium, by ftimulant applications to the nofe. The palatine nerve is the largeft of the branches fent out from the ganglion. We have to recoiled, that there are two canals palling down behind the pa- late ; one anterior and larger; and another running nearly parallel to it, a pofferior and fmaller one. The divifion of the palatine nerve, which defcends through the anterior palatine hole, is of courfe the larger branch ; as it paffes through the canal, it gives branches which enter the nofe, to be diftributed upon the pituitary membrane. This larger branch, in its fur- ther progrefs through the bone, divides, and having emerged from its hole, is diftributed all along on the left palate. The pofterior divifion of the palatine branch, palling down by the pofterior palatine foramen, is diftributed to the velum pendulum palati and its mufcles. There is yet a third branch of the palatine nerve; â€™viz. the external palatine nerve. It is the leaft of all the branches ; and, fometimes, inftead of coming from the ganglion, is derived immediately from the fuperior maxillary nerve. This branch defcends before the pterigoid proceffes, and on the convex furface of the upper

I have feen a more remarkable variety of the lateral finufes. The blood which fliould flow from all thofe parts of the brain from which the fuperior and inferior longitudinal finus, and the vena Galeni, and fourth fmus are derived, feemed, inftead of pafling by the root of the tentorium, to have forfaken thefe channels ; the lateral finufes were left diminutive; and the blood had taken a courfe in the tract of the pofterior occipital finufes, and, after incircling the foramen magnum, it gained its ufual outlet f. The angles of the lateral finufes are ftrengthened by membraneous fafciculi; which pafs radiated from point to point, or are confufedly intricated; betwixt thefe the veins enter as in the longitudinal fmus; where the fmus defcends from the level of the tentorium in the angle formed by the occipital and petrous bones, there are many ftrong irregular fafciculi of fibres : under this point, being no longer proteded from compreflion, by their triangular fhape and the tenfion of the tentorium, the finufes are irregular 5 they are now funk in the • x * - •.* * See Morgagni Adverfaria VI. tab. i. fig. l. | There are inftances of the lateral fimjfes opening into the exter- nal jugular veino fulfil (

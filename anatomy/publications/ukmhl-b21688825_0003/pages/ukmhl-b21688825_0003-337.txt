' OF THE HUMORS OF THE EYE. 313 of the aqueous humor is at once drftinguifhable, from the opaque lens, becaufe it obfcures the iris as well as the pupil. Pus is formed in the chambers of the aqueous humor, in confequence of deep inflammation, contufions, &c. and from the fame caufe, fometimes, proceeds a bloody effuflon. When the pus has lodged in the anterior chamber of the aqueous humor, it would appear, upon the authority of Galen, that an oculifl: of his day per- formed a cure by lhaking the patient’s head * ! It is an operation of oculifts to pundure and allow the pus to flow out, and fome have even fyringed out the pus with water f; but this mull have been on the principles of Jof. Burrhus’s exhibition ; for the natural fecretion is here the bell deluent. When we recoiled the nature of the parts with which the pus lies in contad, we can- pot be fanguine in the hope of fuch an operation faving the eye. Sometimes there remains, after operation on the cornea, or in confequence of ulceration, a continued flow of the aqueous humor ; the confequence is a fub- Tiding of the cornea J; it becomes corrugated, opaque, * Mouchart fays, he has often feen the oculifl Woolhoufe repeat this cure by fhaking his patient's head over the fide of the bed. He attributed the cure to the falling of the pus into the poflerior cham- ber, which, he fuppofes, has parts more capable of abforbing it, f They were at variance regarding the place at which to pun&ure for this difehargeSome did it behind the iris; there we know there is a crowd of veffels ; the belt place is the lower edge of the cornea before the iris. It feems to have been no uncommon acci- dent, in this operation, to find the lens protruded through the pupil. The reafon of this has been already explained. | Rhytidofis, feu fubfidentia & corrugatio cornea”, Y 3 and.

OF TOUCH AND OF THE SKIN, 479 OF THE TRUE SKIN. The true fkin is the denfe, elaftic, and vafcular mem- brane which is under thefe outer laminae, already treated of. While it has firmnefs, flrength, and elaf- ticity to defend the body ; it is alfo an organized fur- face, as important in its function and the healthy action of the fyftem depending upon it nearly as clofely as on the adion of the lungs and furface of the inteftines. The fkin is denfe on the outer furface, while the in- ternal layers are loofe, and gradually degenerate into the cellular fubflance. On the lips, eye-lids, &c, the fkin becomes thin and tranfparent. We have to attend to the pores and vili of the fkin : on narrowly obferving the furface of the fkin, we find it irregularly porous. Thefe are the duds of febaceous glands, which are lodged in the fkin. They tranfmit the hairs alfo, and are the perfpiring and, probably, the abforbing pores; or, at leaft, within thefe larger pores it is probable the abforbing and tranfpiring veffels ter- minate. Thefe pores are moft remarkable about the nofe, mouth, palms of the hands, and foies of the feet, into thefe pores of the true fkin, as we have mentioned, little (heaths of the cutticle enter, and through thefe (heaths the perfpiring matter muft confequently efcape. But, in death, the action of the perfpiring veffels ceaf- ing, the pores of the cutticle are no longer pervious to the fluids, and there is no perfpiration or exudation through them. The vili of the fkin projed above its furface, like the pile of velvet. Tfyey vary much in fize, and are, in fome

138 OF THE PARTICULAR NERVES. the fifth pair. The lenticular ganglion is formed by a twig from the nafal branch of the fifth pair, after being united to that branch of the third pair of nerves* which goes to the levator palpebrce and the re&us fuperior mufeles. The ganglion is of a fquare form, and is iituated upon the outlide of the optic nerve. The ciliary nerves pafs out from this ganglion into two faf- ciculi; they are ten or twelve in number; they are joined by branches of the continued nafal nerve. The ciliary nerves run forward amongfl the fat of the or- bit, to the fclerotic coat of the eye, and pierce it very obliquely in conjunction with the ciliary arteries. The ciliary nerves and arteries then pafs forward betwixt the fclerotic and choroid coats of the eye to the iris. The iris is confidered as the part the moft plentifully fupplied with nerves (as it certainly is alfo with arteries) of any part in the body. It follows, indeed, from what we formerly faid, that a profufe circulation of blood is necelfary to an accumulated nervous power. From the connection of thefe ciliary nerves with thofe palling to the nofe, Soemmerring accounts for fneezing being the confequence of a ftrong light upon the eye. This may perhaps be true; but, certainly, the temporary lofs of light, from fneezing, does not depend upon this connexion of the nerves, but upon the immediate affeCtion of the optic nerve and retina, from the concuffion and interruption to the circulation, or upon the accumulation of blood in the eye. 2. The lachrymal nerve is the leaflt of the three divifions of the opthalmic nerve ; it divides into feveral branches before it enters the gland. Several of thefe branches pals on to the tunica conjun&iva, being joined

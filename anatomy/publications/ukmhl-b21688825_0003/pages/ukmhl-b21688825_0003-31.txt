OF THE MEMBRANES 0? THE BRAIN. 21 the intermediate cellular texture in which the earth of the bones is depofited *. The dura mater adheres more firmly to the bone in young fubje&s, becaufe the bone is yet imperfect, and jts furface fpongy and rough; and, for the fame rea- fon, it is more firmly attached to the fcull in the chronic hydrocephalus, becaufe the ofiification is im- perfect. It frequently adheres fo firmly to the fcull cap, as to leave its outer lamina adhering to the fcull when it is raifed. It adheres more firmly along the futures, and from this caufe, when the fcull is injured, and matter is formed under it, the dura mater will be feparated on each fide of the future, and ftill retain its adhefion to the future, fo as to divide the matter, and, confequently, prevent the full evacuation of the matter when the trepan has been applied on one fide of the future, The dura mater adheres alfo with pe- culiar firmnefs to the bafe of the fcull, becaufe of the jEumercus chinks and foramina. GLANDS OF THE DURA MATER. Upon the external furface of the dura mater there are little holes, from which emerge flefhy-coloured pa- pillae, and which, upon examining the fcull cap, will be found to have correfponding fovese. Thefe are the glandulas Pacchioni f. They are in number from * Taking a portion of the dura mater betwixt the finger and thumb, we can feel the two lamina moving upon each other, from a jlight degree pf laxity in the connecting cellular fubftance. This pellular texture is demonitrated by Malacarpe, by forcibly inject- ing quick-filver betwixt the layers of the membrane. ^ See M. Littre Acad. Roy. des Sciences 1704, Hid. p. 32. art. 19. ten

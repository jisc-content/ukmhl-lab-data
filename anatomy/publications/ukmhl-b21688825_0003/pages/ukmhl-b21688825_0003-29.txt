OF THE MEMBRANES QF THE BRAIN. 9 * The dura mater* is a firm and fomewhat opaque membrane.—When the feud-cap is torn off, and it is cleaned from the blood which efcapes from the rup- tured vefiels, it is feen marbled with azure and rofy colours. It partakes more of the former in youth than in thofe; advanced in years, or in the robull and fan- guineous f. Its outer furface is rough, from the adhe- fions to the bone being tprn up; but on the furface lying in contaft with the brain, it is fmooth, filming, and of a pearl colour. Although the dura mater is really the flrongefl membrane of the body, it is yet divifible into laminae; thefe are Itrengthened and firmly connected by the in- tertexture of Itrong fibres. Molt anatomifls defcribe it as compofed of two laminae. Some however defcribe three laminae—the outer lamina, or fquamofa; the mid- dle, or filamentofa; and the internal (being fmooth and uniform), the lamina membranofa J.—But to feparate the dura mater into fuch laminae, it will, I be- lieve, be neceflary to dry it and tear it into fhreds. No doubt it may be poflible thus to tear it, as fome have done, into four, fix, feven, or even eight laminae or * The membranes of the brain have the name of mater, becaufe they defend the brain and protedl its tender fubftance, or, according to fome anatomifls of the Arabian fchool, becaufe the other membranes of t'he body are produced from them. Before Galen, the term Me- ninx was common to all the membranes of the body, afterwards it was appropriated to thofe of the brain. ■f Malacarne Encefalotomia Nuova, p. 19. t Malacarne, p. 22. It is defcribed as partly tendinous, partly ligamentous: that is to fay, of a nature refembling thefe, yet not alto- gether the fame. Vicq. d’Azyr found it feparated by purulent matter into two laminae, the fibres of which had a different direction. Acad, de Sciences, An 1781. p. 497—Bartholin Sp. Hiftor. Anatomise. fquamse.

A pair of inferior prominences may exist below this region of the third ventricle, called lobi inferiores (Fig. 335, 7), which may, but more probably do not, answer to the corpora mammillaria. 14. The corpora quadrigemina in man are again but feeble rudiments compared with their possible relative development as shown by the brains of other animals. The nates may be smaller than the testes (as in the Hedgehog), or larger (as in the Rabbit). In that this mid-brain region in man bears these four prominences, it agrees with the same part in all Mammals, but among Sauropsidans we find instead, two large rounded hollow spheres (called the optic lobes), placed in Reptiles immediately behind the hemispheres, but in Birds depressed to the side of the brain, below the level of the cerebellum (Fig. 338, 4). It is, however, in Fishes that the mid-brain region attains its maximum relative size. This region is considered by most writers to form the optic lobes, but it has been asserted Fig. 336â€”Dorsal Aspect of the Brain of a Ray or Skate (Rata batis). 1, one of the two olfactory lobes ; 2, the conjoined cerebral hemispheres; 3, the pineal gland ; 4, one of the so-called "optic lobes" ; 5, the median structun commonly called the "cerebellum" ; 6, one of the corpora restiformia. to be yet more developed, and to include a part which has generally been regarded (and in all probability rightly so) as representing the cerebellum of higher animals. Thus in the Rays there is a great complex mass folded in numerous

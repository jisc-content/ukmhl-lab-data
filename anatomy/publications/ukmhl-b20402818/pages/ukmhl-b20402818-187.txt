153 SKELETON OF UPPER LIMB. IV.] The bones of the superior extremity of man are of medium development as to numbers, for they may be more numerous (though rarely much so), or less numerous, since we may select a series of forms in which the number gradually diminishes to zero. Fig. 127.—Front View of Scapular, or Shoulder, Girdle of the Skate— Rata clavata. (After Parker.) This figure shows how in this animal the shoulder girdle abuts against each .side of the vertebral column. c, coracoid element; ec, epicoracoid element; s, scapular element; ss, supra- scapular; v, vertebral column cut across vertically and transversely, and showing the canal for the spinal marrpw in its midst. 11. The scapula of man agrees in the essentials of its composition with that of every species of his class except the Monotremes. It agrees, that is, in having the coracoid pro- cess annexed to it as a mere process ending freely, and not, as in the Monotremes and in most lower Vertebrates, where the coracoid is a distinct and largely developed bone, ex- tending down to the sternum. Fig. 128. —Shoulder Girdle of a Bird (Diver). {After Parker.) c, right coracoid (its lower end abuts against the sternum—here removed): cl, the clavicles (merrythought); sc, the right scapula—the rounded glenoid surface is indicated in the scapula just where it joins the coracoid. Man's scapula, apart from this process, is, as we have seen, flat and triangular—a shape which, though common, is by no means universal in the Vertebrata. Thus, e.g., in Birds we find the scapula to consist of a long, narrow, more or less sabre-shaped bone, though not quite always so, as it becomes considerably broadened out in the Penguin.

v.] SKELETON OF LOWER LIMB. 179 N strongly marked prominence called the posterior inferior spinous process, beneath which the border is deeply excavated and concave. The inner surface of the ilium is concave, forming the iliac fossa, and at its hinder part is a rough irregular space for articulation with the sacrum. The ilium forms about the upper third of the socket for the thigh-bone.

The piriis, or pubic bone, forms the inner part of the thigh- socket, joining the ilium above, and at its junction con- tributing to form the ilio-pectineal eminence. It thence pro- ceeds horizontally inwards (as a band of bone flattened from without inwards, called the horizontal ramus) till it meets with its fellow of the opposite side, when it turns sharply down- wards. The junction of the two pubes is termed the sym- physis, and the part of each pubis next the symphysis is sometimes called the body*; thence the pubis runs outwards and downwards (as a flattened band, similar to the horizontal ramus, with which it forms an acute angle) till it meets the ascending ramus of the ischium. The ischium forms the outer and lower part of the thigh- socket, and indeed of the whole os innominatum. The body of the ischium forms about two-fifths of the socket for the thigh, which cavity is situated on its outer side. The body is broad, and sends from its posterior outer margin a large sharp a

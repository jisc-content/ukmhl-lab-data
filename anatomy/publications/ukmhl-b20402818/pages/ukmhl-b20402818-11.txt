PREFACE. vii Certain of the facts noticed in these Lessons are recent additions to science, yet in hardly any instance has reference been made to their discoverers. Such references have been omitted in order not to overload a school book with notes. Indeed, I make very little claim to originality except as regards the special mode adopted in my treatment of the subject. By this I mean the exposition pari passu of the facts of human anatomy with a selection of those most interesting and important in the anatomy of animals formed on the same type as man himself. The originals of many of the woodcuts are from the works of Professors Owen, Huxley, and Flower, and of Mr. Parker and others. Some original drawings have been made from specimens preserved in the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons and of the British Museum. Some have been added from specimens in my own collection. I am happy here to express my obligations for the ready kindness with which my requirements for illustration have been supplied. I also feel it no less a duty than a pleasure to declare how much I am indebted to a near relative, Mr. Henry Davies Chapman, for having kindly undertaken, amidst the pressure of other avocations, a patient revisal of the proofs of the present work, the publication of which, but for this timely assistance, might have been indefinitely delayed. 7, North Bank, Regent's Park, Nove?nber 1872.

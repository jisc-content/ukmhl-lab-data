In the Mole, however, there is a strong ligamentous connexion between these parts, and in the Three-toed Sloth the sepa- ration is a secondary condition, owing to the gradual atrophy of the acromion which was primitively connected with the clavicle. The supra-spinatus fossa may be about equal to the infra- spinatus one, as in the Dog and Shrew, or larger than it, as in the Lion and in Sloths. It may, on the contrary, be little more than a groove, as in the Dolphin, or it may (and this is very exceptional) be large and situate entirely on the inner (or body) surface of the blade, as in the Echidna.

Fig. 131.—Scapula of a Porpoise. a, acromion ; c, coracoid; g, glenoid surface. The portion for the origin of the teres major muscle may be greatly produced, as in the Armadillos and even in Baboons. The superior border of the scapula may be very much longer than the base, as in Ungulates, and enormously so in the Mole. It may, on the contrary, be relatively shorter even rtian in man, as in the Chimpanzee. It may be very convex, as in the Mandrill Baboon ; and, most strange of all, it may form what is apparently the posterior margin of the scapula, as in the Echidna. The supra-scapular notch may be converted into a foramen, as even in one of man's order {e.g. in Mycetes), and in the Two- toed Sloth. The notch, however, may be entirely absent, as in the Deer and many others. The base may be much the shortest of the three borders, as in the Dog and Ungulates, and especially in the Mole. It

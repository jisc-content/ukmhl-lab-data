249 vii.] THE EXTERNAL SKELETON. The epithelial lining of the stomach may take on a dense horny structure, as in the gizzards of Birds, but this will be again noticed under the head of Alimentary Organs. 14. We come now to enderonic appendages. As has been said, that part of the dermis which underlies the epidermis is devoid of hard structures in man, who possesses them in the sub-epithelial enderon only. Such structures are the TEETH. Each tooth consists of a " crown," which is visible, and of a "fang" or " fangs," which are buried in the gum. 15. The mode of formation of the teeth has been described in the Twelfth Lesson of "Physiology:" how the teeth first arise as little processes (or papillae) of the dermis, which appear at the bottom of a groove running along each side of the jaw ; how the walls of the groove grow together, between and over each of the papillae, and thus enclose the papillae in what are called the dental sacs. Each such sac is a pouch of the dermis, enclosing a "pinched off" bit of the epidermis. The papilla, assuming the form of the future tooth, becomes hardened by a deposit within it of calcareous salts, the central part of the papilla remaining soft (as the pulp) but diminishing with the growth of the tooth, till, when the tooth is full grown, there is but a minute aper- ture at the bottom of each root to give entrance to very delicate vessels and nerves. 16. The STRUCTURE of each tooth, how it consists of three substances, "dentine, enamel, and cement," and the nature of each of these, have also been described in the " Elementary Physiology." 7ig 217.â€”Four Plates of Baleen seen obliquely from within.

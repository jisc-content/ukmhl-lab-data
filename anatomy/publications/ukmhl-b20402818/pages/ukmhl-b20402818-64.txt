ELEMENTARY ANATOMY. [less. Metapophyses and Anapophyses, visible on the first lumbar vertebra, disappear on lower ones. 13. Below the lumbar vertebras comes a solid complex bone before mentioned—the SACRUM, of a roughly triangular form, with one angle downwards. Its front surface is strongly con- cave vertically, less so transversely. It is really made up of five vertebrae fused together, and plain traces of its original composition remain in the fully ossified bone of the most aged individuals. The centra diminish in size from above downwards through the sacral series. The neural canal, completed as usual {i.e. by bone) above, remains unossified and closed by membrane only at the lower end of the sacrum, through the imperfect development of the neural arches of the inferior sacral vertebrae. Neural spines form a median, backwardly projecting ridge behind the sacrum, which ridge projects most above. Transverse processes are largely developed, especially above. By their anchylosis they form the lateral masses of the sacrum. On both the anterior and posterior surfaces of the sacrum four apertures, one oeiow the other, are visible on each side. This appearance is produced by coalescence of the sacral transverse processes, thus :— Fig. 44.—Front and Back Aspects of the Sacrum. a, auricular surface ; z, prezygapophysis at upper end of posterior surface of sacrum. Nerves, as before said, pass out on each side between the pedicles of adjacent vertebrae. Now the coalescence of the sacral transverse processes necessarily changes each such intervertebral opening into a pair of openings, of which one is dorsal and the other ventral.

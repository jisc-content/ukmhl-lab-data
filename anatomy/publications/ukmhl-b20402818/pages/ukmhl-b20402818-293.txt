vii.] THE EXTERNAL SKELETON. 257 may meet with alveoli thoroughly complete, like those of man, as in most members of his class. These complete alveoli, however, may be in some respects different from those of man. They are so where teeth grow Fig. 224.—Inner Side of Lower Jaw of Pleurodont Lizard, showing the teeth attached to the inner surface of its side. from permanent pulps throughout the whole of life—like the tusks of the Elephant and the teeth of many other beasts {e.g. the cutting teeth of the Squirrel). In such cases, of course, the deeper part of the alveolus is quite wide instead of being attenuated as in us. 23. The NUMBER of teeth in man is interesting as being not very far from that which is typical of the great bulk of the class to which he belongs. It is identical with that exist- ing in the whole of the Apes which inhabit the old world, and those of the new world only differ from him by the presence of one more pre-molar or by the absence of a molar on each side of each jaw. In man's own class the number of teeth developed may be very great, as in the Dolphins, where the greatest number is reached in Poutoporia, namely 220. The large Armadillo (Priodon) may have as many as ninety. They may be reduced to two, as in the Narwhal. If we pass out of man's class we may find teeth many or few, as in Reptiles ; but amongst Fishes we meet with every extreme, from a single pointed tooth on the roof of the mouth, as in Alyxijie, or two above and two below (flat and crushing), as in Ceratodus, up to such a multitude that to count them would be a task both useless and difficult, as in Murcena, the Pike, or Osteoglossum. 24. The FORMS presented by the teeth of man agree more or less closely with what we find in many members of his class, but have no relation, or only the most general and distant one, to the teeth of cold-blooded Vertebrates. Although the shape of the teeth is nearly the same in all men, nevertheless the wisdom teeth of those races which are s

Their occasionally bifid condition in man may be repeated in much lower Vertebrates {e.g. Axolotl), and sometimes (as in Poly- pterus) there may be two neural spines to one vertebra, one in Fig. 51. -Dorsal view of Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth Post Sacral Vertebrae of the Axolotl, showing the laterally bi- furcating neural spines, each concave at its extremity. (From the College of Surgeons' Museum.) The third and fourth vertebrae have each two transverse processes and four ribs on the side shown; the third vertebra has also two neural spines, s, neural spine ; p, lower ribs. The series of upper ribs is not distinguished by any letter. {From the College of Szirgeons' Museum.) the front {i.e. pre-axial) of the other. Indeed, in the Conger we have two such projections from each side of the neural arch. In certain flat fishes they may be detached from the arches and intercalated between them. They may expand and simulate dermal scutes, as in the Tortoises. They may project through the skin of the back, as in the Potto, or be produced into long, free filamentary processes, as in the Lizards called Basilisks. The intervertebral foramina of man are normal, but in Fig 53.â€”Seven Trunk-Vertebrae of the Potto, showing the nervous perforations in the neural laminae. some animals, even so nearly allied to man as the Potto, also in the Horse, Ox, Monotremes, and others, the nerves

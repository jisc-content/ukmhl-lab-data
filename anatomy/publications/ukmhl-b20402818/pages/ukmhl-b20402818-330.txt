The muscle formed by the union of these heads is inserted into the tubercle of the radius. Brachialis anticus. This term is applied to a muscle placed beneath the biceps, springing from the front of the humerus and inserted into the coronoid process of the ulna. The triceps is the largest muscle of the arm, and is inserted into the olecranon. It arises by three heads : one {long) from the lower border of the glenoid cavity, one {external) from the humerus below the great tuberosity, one {internal or short) from the inner surface of the humerus.

The MUSCLES OF THE FORE-ARM consist of pronators and supinators, flexors and extensors. Pronator teres. A muscle thus named rotates the fore-arm in the way described in the lesson on the bones of the arm under the name "pronation." It arises from the inner condyle

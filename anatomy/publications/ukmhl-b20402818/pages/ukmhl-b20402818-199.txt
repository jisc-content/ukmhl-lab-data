SKELETON OE UPPER LIMB. IV.] dyle, as e.g. in the Wombat. This serves to transmit the median nerve and brachial artery, which are thus protected by bone in a way found only by a very rare exception indeed, if ever, in man. There may be a notch or a foramen above the external condyle, as in some Lizards, e.g. Psammosaurus. The transverse extent of the inferior articular surfaces of the humerus of man is greater than in very many forms, on account of the articular surface for the radius coming to be in front of, instead of at the side of, that for the ulna. We see this very distinctly, e.g., in the Dog. Fig. 141.â€” Anterior Surface of Right Humerus of Wombat (Ptow/wwj/j vombatiis). h, head; bg, bicipital groove : t, great or radial tuberosity; t', small or ulnar tuberosity ; dr, deltoid ridge ; sr, supinator ridge ; cf, supra-condylar foramen ; ec, external condyle ; ic, internal condyle ; ar, articular surface for radius ; au, articular surface for ulna. (From Flower s " Osteology") The fossae for the coronoid process and olecranon, which sometimes communicate by a perforation in man's humerus, may do so normally and constantly, as e.g. in the Hare. Rarely (as in some Tailed-Batrachians) a dense ligament may connect the head of the humerus with the glenoid cavity, as we shall see that the head of the thighbone is normally connected with the cavity which receives it.

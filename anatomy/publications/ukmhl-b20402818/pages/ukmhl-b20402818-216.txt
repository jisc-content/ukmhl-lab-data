[LESS. ELEMENTAR V ANA TO MY. which to the femur is indicated by a pit on the head of that bone. It is also attached by a bag-like (or capsular) liga- ment, which, extending from the innominate bone, is inserted into the inter-trochanteric lines. It is the neck of the femur which is so often broken by old persons, through alteration, not only in the texture, but also in the shape of the bone ; for with age the neck comes to form with the shaft a less and less open angle, and the bone is thus less and less adapted to resist vertical pressure.

Fracture of the neck of the bone is called a fracture within the capsule, because the part broken is within the capsular ligament. Such a fracture can never be adjusted, the leg being drawn up by the muscles and shortened, producing incurable lameness for the rest of life. On the outer side of the hinder part of the femur, a little below the great trochanter, is a more or less marked vertical ridge, which serves for the insertion of the gluteus maximus muscle. At the lower end of the femur are two prominences named condyles (see Fig. 154), separated behind by a median de- pression. The external condyle is the larger, and more forwardly pro- jecting ; its articulating surface is also broader and ascends higher on the front of the bone. On its outer surface is a pit for the tendon of the popliteus muscle, immediately above which is a projection named the external tuberosity. The internal condyle is longer, and descends lower down than the external one. On its inner side is a projection called the internal tuberosity. The articular surfaces of the femur meet in front, and form

ELEMENTAR V ANA TO MY. 344 [less. going to the inside of the tibia above the insertion of the gracilis. A muscle exists in Reptiles {e.g. the Iguana and Chameleon) which may answer to this. It arises from the front pelvic tendinous arch, or from the brim of the pelvis, and is inserted into the peroneal side of the head of the tibia (Iguana), or, bifurcating, sends one branch to the tibia and the other to the inter-articular cartilage (Chameleon). (Figs. 309 and 310,6*. Fig. 309. —Deepest Muscles of Right Thigh of Iguana, the more super- ficial ones being removed. A, adductor ; BF, biceps femoris; C, crureus ; FC, femoro-caudal; Gol, gas- trocnemius internus ; IP, ilio-peroneal; OE, obturator externus ; OI, obturator internus ; Pc 1—3, muscles which more or less resemble the pectineus ; Pf, probably the gluteus maximus ; RF, part of the great extensor of the thigh ; S, tibial adductor; SM and ST, muscles resembling the semi-membranosus and semi-tendinosus respectively ; VI, vastus internus ; V, tendon descending from the tendon of the femoro-caudal to the inter-articular cartilage of the knee-joint. Quadriceps extensor crtiris. The large muscular mass thus named in man, has by no means in him attained its maximum of size and complexity. Even in man's order, e.g. Lemur, the portion called crureus, instead of being but a mere imperfectly differentiated part of the vastus internus, is a large and very distinct muscle; while in a nearly allied form, Tarsius, the vastus externus is divided into two parts,

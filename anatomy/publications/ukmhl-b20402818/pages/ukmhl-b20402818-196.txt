[less. 162 ELEMENTAR Y ANA TOM Y. It may be small and serve to connect the clavicles, as in Birds, where it forms the middle of the merrythought. It may be very large and bifold, as in many Fishes, e.g. Cottus and the Sturgeon. The true clavicle, more or less cylindrical or at least slender in Mammals and Birds, may become expanded in Lizards (e.g. Hemidactylus, Cyclodus, and especially Trachydosaurus). In Chelonians also the clavicles are greatly expanded and form the two foremost bones of the ventral part of the carapace, the median one immediately behind them being the inter-clavicle.

The great size of the clavicle here and in Trachydosaurus prepares us for the still vaster development of this part in bony Fishes, where the clavicles become enormous, and may not only be provided with a distinct inter-clavicle, but also each with a distinct portion above—the supra-clavicle (as in the Dory, Zeus, the Sturgeon and others), and besides this with a posterior element, a post-clavicle, as in the Dory, Perch, and Cod. Thus the clavicle of man, instead of being the simple struc-

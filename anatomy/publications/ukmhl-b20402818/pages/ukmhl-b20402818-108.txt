ELEMENT A R Y ANA TOMY. [less. 74 LESSON III. THE SKELETON OF THE HEAD. I. The remaining part of the axial endoskeleton is the skeleton of the head, familiarly known as THE SKULL. This large rounded bony case for the brain is also the seat of the organs of sense, and forms one coherent mass, except the lower jaw, which in the dry skull readily falls away from the rest. Neglecting for the present this lower jaw—or, as it is called in zootomy, mandible—the rest of the skull is rounded behind and above, and more or less flattened in front, below, and at the sides. Behind and above, it presents a pretty smooth and even surface, crossed by those undulating, interdigitating lines of bony union spoken of in the last Lesson as sutures. When sections are made it is seen that the rounded portion forms the roof and hinder boundary of the great cavity in which is lodged the brain, and that irregular bony promi- nences are placed below the front part of that cavity. The skull then may be roughly divided into— (1) The brain-case, skull proper, or Calvarium.1 (2) The skeleton of the face. Certain conspicuous openings and prominences occur in different regions. The projecting part of the back of the head is termed the occiput, and beneath it is a large hole, looking downwards, termed the occipital foramen. On each side of the front part of this hole is a rounded projection, and these projections, termed occipital condyles, articulate with the cup-shaped hollows on the upper side of the atlas vertebra (see Fig. 89). Thus the margins of this foramen coincide with the neural arch of the atlas vertebra, and the interior of the skull forms the expanded summit of the vertebral neural canal; indeed 1 From calva, the skull.

226 ELEMENTA RY ANA TO MY. [less. be considered as the precursor of the axial system, and the parts of such lamellae as foreshadowing the future carti- laginous and bony complexities which come ultimately to occupy parts of the areas of such lamellae. Such com- plexities are the most complete expression known to us of the axial skeleton, as the membranous lamellae are its most imperfect and undifferentiated form. The parts of the axial skeleton may be tabulated as follows : — Central Bodies of verte- brae (or noto- chord). Epaxial . Hypaxial j'Neural spines. ^Neural arches IProzygapophyseS. Postzygapophyses- Metapophyses. Anapophyses. Hyperapophyses Zygantrum. Zygosphene. (Diapophyses—upper ribs. Hypapophyses (either sin- gle or forked, or as de- tached chevron bones). I Trabecule. J Mandible. Splanchnapophyses . . \ Cornicula and hyoid. I Cornua and hyoid. \ Branchial arches. Ventral boundary of the heart-sac, never ossified or chondrified. 13. We may now specially consider the anterior end of the axial skeleton, reviewing the structure of man's skull in the light afforded by the study of other animals. That division which was made at starting between the skeleton of the face and of the brain-case now appears to have been both true and significant. All the face and both jaws are, we have seen, ossifications around the anterior splanchnapophyses, and are but of small size compared with the same parts as developed even in some members of man's own class {e.g. the Whale). More- over, we have seen that such parts in him are but mere rudi- ments of what may be developed in other animals, as is made manifest in Fishes, with their largely developed branchial skeleton and complex suspensorial apparatus for the jaws.

Vertebral Column in a Salmon. {From Specimens in the British Museum?) It is in aquatic forms that the tail attains the greatest relative bulk, and in some Sharks may contain the prodigious number of 270 vertebrae. It is in the Tortoises that we find the tail supported by the only free vertebrae which are not cervical, all those of the trunk being immovably united with the ribs and with the dermal bony plates forming altogether the shell, or carapace. The maximum of degradation and abortion of the coccyx is in the Bats, where coccygeal vertebras may be reduced to two. The coccyx of birds generally consists of from six to eight vertebrae, but may have ten. At its end is a so-called plough- share-bone, consisting of two or more anchylosed vertebrae. The peculiar coccyx of the Frog never consists of distinct vertebrae at any time of life, but is formed by the ossification of the membrane which surrounds the notochord, to which two small neural arches become attached. In osseous Fishes the end of the tail is turned up and remains persistently as a cartilaginous rudiment at the end of the vertebral column, generally hidden and enclosed by special bony plates. In the higher animals provided with numerous coccygeal vertebrae, these vertebrae are often provided with processes and articulations as complex as those of vertebrae more anteriorly situate.

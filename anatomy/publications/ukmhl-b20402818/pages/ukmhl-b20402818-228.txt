194 ELEMENTARY ANATOMY. [less. pectoral girdle. In some Fishes, as e.g. the Angler (Lofl/n'us), the ossa innominata are articulated directly with the hinder border of the clavicles, while in other Fishes they very often are but little removed from them. Fishes in which the hinder limbs are placed far forwards are called thoracic (as the Perch), and when still more so, jugular (as the Cod). Rarely, as e.g. in the Opah Fish {Lampris), the os innomi- natum joins ths coracoid, which in this species is enormously enlarged. ii. Certain bones called MARSUPIAL BONES, of which no ossified representatives exist in man, may be attached to the pelvis. Thus, in him the internal tendon of each external oblique muscle is neither ossified nor chondrified. In all Mar- supials, however (except the Thylacine, or Tasmanian Wolf) and in the Monotremes, these tendons are largely ossified, the ossifications being movably articulated with the brim of the pelvis. Such ossifications constitute the marsupial bones. In the Tasmanian Wolf these parts are represented by carti- lages, but no such structures have been detected in other Mammals, except that there is a slight chondrification of the same part in the Dog. In the Chameleon the brim of the pelvis supports small bony nodules, and in the Ostrich a small bone is attached to the front of the pubis. Possibly tas before said) the so-called pubic bones of Reptiles may be marsupial bones, if they do not rather correspond to ilio-pectineal eminences. Another possible ossification which has no representative Fig. i66. - Pelvis of Echidna. z"/, ilium; m, marsupial bone ;/, pubis, s, sacrum.

in.] THE CRANIAL SKELETON. 103 margins of the glenoid surface are so prolonged that the lower jaw cannot be removed, even from the dry skull, with- out fracture of one of those osseous processes. Fig. 100.—Side View of the Skull of a Perch. {After Cuvier.) 1, the frontal; 2, the pre-frontal; 4, the sphenotic ; 7, parietal; 8, supra-occipital; 9, exiotic; 11, pro-otic; 12, pterotic; 17, pre-maxilla ; 18, maxilla; 19, first sub-orbital bone, or lachrymal; 19', chain of posterior sub-orbitals; 20, nasal; 21, one of a chain of post-temporal ossicles ; 23, hyo-mandibular ; 24, ecto-pterygoid ; 26, quadrate ; 27, meta-pterygoid ; 28, operculum ; 30, pre- operculum; 31, symplectic; 32, sub-operculum ; 33, inter-operculum ; 34, dentary ; 35, articular ; 36, angular ; 42, urohyal ; 46, post-temporal, or bone connecting scapular arch with skull. The projecting (zygomatic) portion of the squamous element is constantly present in Mammals, though it may end freely, as in Centetes and Sorex, or join the frontal instead of the malar, as in the Horse. It also projects freely downwards in most Birds, but it may (as in some Parrots) articulate with a post-frontal element. In Reptiles also it may project forward and form a sort of upper zygoma by articulating with the post-frontal, as in some Lizards (e.g. Sphenodon, Cyclodus), or it may be articulated with the cranium at one end only, as in Python—the other end projecting backwards and slightly outwards, to give ad- ditional mobility to the lower jaw.

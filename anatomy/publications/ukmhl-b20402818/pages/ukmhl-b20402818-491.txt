455 THE ALIMENTARY SYSTEM. XI.] Further subdivision is rare, though it may exist, as e.g. in the Rodent Capromys, which has a liver consisting of many very small lobules ; and in the Camel, which has numerous small superficial lobules on that organ. In the Seals also there are many secondary fissures. The left lateral lobe may be very little developed, as in Semnopithecus. The same may be the case with regard to the left central, as in the Noctule Bat. The right lateral lobe may be excessively small, as in the Hare. The caudate lobe may be absent, and the Spigelian quite rudimentary, as in the Wombat. Fig. 386.â€”Liver of the Two-toed Sloth (Cholcepzis) seen from beneath, its front margin being turned upwards. [After Flower.') c, caudate lobe ; g, gall-bladder; Ic, left 'central lobe ; rc, right central lobe ; rl, right lateral lobe; s, s, enormous Spigelian lobe. The caudate lobe may attain a great size, as in the American Ape Pithecia (where it is as large as any other lobe of the liver), and in the Hedgehog. The Spigelian lobe may take on an excessive relative development, as in the little deer Tragulus, and above all in Cholcepus. The liver may be even more simple than in man, as in the Dolphins, where it consists of two lobes only, and is very small. It may, as in the Hippopotamus, have no fissures whatever visible, the representative of the umbilical vein running deep and enclosed in the substance of the liver.

[less. 6o posterior transverse processes, metapophyses, neural arch and neural spine, together with hypapophysial processes or arches (chevron bones), may be present in man's own class. In Fishes the hypapophysial parts may be very largely developed, as, e.g., in the Flat-fishes. In Tailed-Batrachians, the anterior Fig. 71.—Part of the Vertebral Column of a Sole. u, neural spines ; p, transverse processes ; k, hypapophyses. coccygeal vertebrae {e.g. in Menobranchus) may be furnished with true ribs, supported by both tubercular and capitular transverse processes, in addition to articular, neural, and hypapophysial parts.

The downwardly tapering condition of the coccygeal verte- brae which exists in man is the general condition of such parts ; but sometimes, as in the little Armadillo Chlamy- dophorns, the transverse processes increase in size instead of decreasing in that direction.

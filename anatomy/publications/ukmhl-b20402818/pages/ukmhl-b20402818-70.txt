ELEMENTARY ANA TOMY. [less. 3S arch was permanently distinct from {i.e. unanchylosed with) the centrum, and in the Carp the transverse processes are separate. Even the neural arches may be made up of two separate pieces on each side, as in Elasmobranch fishes, e.g. Raid and Sftiiiax. That degree of adjustment of parts which exists in each vertebra of man is not universal. Thus, e.g., we find in the Tortoises neural arches so shifted as to be respectively annexed to two centra, and thus the intervertebral foramen comes to be placed opposite the middle of each vertebral body. A similar displacement takes place in the upper parts of the divided neural arches of the Elasmobranchs just referred to, so that the parts are united by a zigzag suture. e Fig. 48 —Axial Longitudinal Section of the Vertebral Column of an Elasmobranch (Ram). /:, one of the centra which, being bi-concave, forms lozenge-shaped sections by its junctions with the concave surfaces of adjacent vertebral centra ; 5, a neural spine ; n2, one of the dorsal parts of a neural lamina; «j, one of the ventral parts of a neural lamina. 20. The number of vertebras in man is far less than exists in most Vertebrates, though more than in some. No Verte- brate has much less than a third his number—even the Frogs having ten. On the other hand, some sharks have more than eleven times as many vertebras as man, and some serpents more even than a dozen times his number. Man has the smallest number existing in his own class, with the exception of some Bats and Monkeys. 21. The division of the vertebrae into the five categories of man's vertebral column is common to most forms above Fishes, but we may find the lumbar vertebras indistinguish- able and the sacral absent ; and in Fishes we can hardly define even a single cervical, the vertebras being reduced to but two categories, namely, those of the trunk and those of the tail.

[less. RLE ME NT A RY ANA TO MY. 138 is generally (as notably, e.g., in the Hare and Mole) also a fossa for that process of the brain called the flocculus of the cerebellum. In some Reptiles, however (as, e.g., the Turtle), the bony investment of the internal ear is incomplete on its cranial side; and in Fishes it is even widely open, forming a large chamber communicating with the general cranial cavity, and termed the " otocrane." 36. That degree of completeness of THE orbits which exists in man—serving for the protection of the eyeball by extensions of the cranial bones—is a very exceptional condi- tion. Only in him and in the higher members of his order —that is, the Monkeys—do we find such an enclosure ; but in some of them it may be more complete than it is in him, by the junction of the greater wing of the sphenoid with the upper maxillary bone, so that the spheno-maxillary fissure is reduced to a short and rounded aperture, or even (as in the Howling Monkeys) all but or quite obliterated. The relative size of the orbits may be much greater than in man, as e.g. in Indris, in the Night-Ape (Nyctipithecus), or in the Tarsier. On the other hand, the orbits may be rela- tively smaller than in man, as in the Whales. Fig. ttq-—Front View of the Skull of the Lemuroid Indris Laniger; showing the large size of the orbits, which are also shown to open widely behind into the temporal fossse. They may be much more widely separated from each other in proportion to their size and the size of the skull, as in the Dog and most Mammals. On the other hand, they may be much more approximated, as in the Tarsier and in the Squirrel Monkey \Chrysothrix), where they are in part separated by membrane only. In a great number of animals,

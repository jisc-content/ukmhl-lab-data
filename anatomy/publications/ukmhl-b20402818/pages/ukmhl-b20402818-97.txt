63 II,] THE SPINAL SKELETON. pophyses, is a character common to most animals of man's class, but the centrum does not appear to have epiphyses in the Sirenia, Monotremata, and in the animals below the mammalian class. In those Mammals which have chevron-bones there are, of course, ossifications which do not exist in man. Fig. 74.â€” Caudal Vertebra of a Crocodile. c, centrum ; s, neural spine ; t, transverse process ; z, pre-zygapophysis ; 2', post- zygapophysis ; hy, hypapophysis, or "chevron-bone." In the lower Vertebrata the vertebral bodies may be at first formed by superficial ring-like ossifications, as in many Fishes ; and in some, as in the Carp, distinct lateral ossifi- cations may exist, one on each side of the centrum. The walls of the two concave vertebral, articular cups may ossify, making an hour-glass-shaped ossification, to which concentric or radiating lamellae may be added, as in certain Sharks. Cortical ossifications {i.e. of the fibrous sheath of the notochord) may appear and coalesce with vertebras, as in the coccygeal vertebras of the Frog. Sometimes, as in Lepidosiren, bony neural arches may be formed, and more or less embrace a permanently soft and unossified chorda dorsalis. 33. A bony case, like the thorax of man, exists in all Beasts and Birds, without exception. It also generally exists in Reptiles, but is strangely modified in serpent-like Lizards, and in Tortoises. In the former it is enormously drawn out, and made imperfect below by the small development of a sternum. In the latter it attains a maximum of solidity, and enters into bony union with the dermal skeleton.

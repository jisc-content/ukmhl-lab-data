THE EXTERNAL SKELETON. 273 singularly dense and hard, well suited for breaking up their stony prey. The jaws of the fish are shaped like a parrot's beak (whence its name); but it is a beak which singularly and interestingly differs in structure from that of a bird. Fig. 250.—Vertical Section of the Lower Jaw of a Shark (Lamna), showing the uppermost erect tooth with the others below in various stages, each ready to come successively into place when its predecessor is removed. (After Owen.) A bird's beak is, as we have seen, a modification of the epidermis. This fish-beak, however, is a truly enderonic structure, and calcareous, not horny. It is, in fact, formed of an immense number of small elongated teeth, which, closely packed side by side, are attached by their proximal ends to the surface of both the upper and lower beak-shaped jaws. As these jaws with the annexed denticles are worn away by use at their margins, both are replaced by a com- mon down-growth of bone and teeth in the upper jaw, and by a common upgrowth of bone and teeth in the lower one.

The structure of man's teeth supplies us with a key by which we may understand that of Vertebrates gene- rally; nor is there any real increase of complexity as to the number of the constituent materials, though the dentine may

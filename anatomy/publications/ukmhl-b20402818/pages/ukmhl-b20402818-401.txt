365 IX.] THE NER VO US S YS TEA/. LESSON IX. THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND ORGANS OF SENSE. 1. The NERVOUS system may perhaps be considered the primary and most important of all the systems of parts of which the body is composed, because it dominates and directs, as it were, the actions of the other parts. Moreover, sometimes at least, it serves as a criterion in settling dis- puted homologies of structures which belong to other systems. Thus, the question as to what bone in one animal answers to what bone in another animal is often determined, as in the case of some cranial bones, by the several relations of such bones to a certain nerve ; and the same kind of test may not improbably serve to determine many muscular homo- logies also. 2. The primary structures of which the nervous system is composed (i.e. nerve-fibres and ganglionic corpuscles) have been described in the " Elementary Physiology," Lesson XII. §§ 16 and 19, and the nervous system as a whole has also been sketched in Lesson XL of the same work. Therein have been duly set forth its main component parts —the brain and spinal marrow (or cerebro-spinal axis), to- gether with the membranes which invest them—as also the nerves issuing from such parts, including those which are spoken of as the sympathetic system. 3. Here we must recapitulate so far as to state that the solid structures (skull and neural vertebral canal) which pro- tect the cerebro-spinal axis are lined by a dense membrane— the dura materj while the cerebro-spinal axis itself is closely invested by a delicate membrane—the pia mater. Inter- posed between the two is a double very delicate epithelial layer (called the arachnoid), forming a shut sac (as the peri- toneum forms a shut sac) and containing the arachnoid fluid.

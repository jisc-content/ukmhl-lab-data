THE EXCRETORY ORGANS. 463 The two pleurae line the right and left halves of the thorax, and are reflected over the two lungs at their roots respectively. In this way the two adjacent (inner) sides of the two pleurae traverse the thorax from behind forwards. They are not, however, in contact, but separated by two interspaces termed mediastina. The anterior mediastinum contains the heart in its pericar- dium, as described in our Tenth Lesson. The posterior mediastinum contains the oesophagus, the aorta, the vena azygos, and the thoracic duct, together with the pneumogastric nerves. Fig. 392.—Transverse Section of the Chest, with the Heart and Lungs (each Lung invested with its Pleura) in place. DV, dorsal vertebra, or joint of the backbone ; Ao, Ad, aorta, the top of its arch being cut away in this section; SC, superior vena cava; PA, pulmonary artery, divided into a branch for each lung ; LP, EP, left and right pulmonary veins ; Br, bronchi ; RL, LL, right and left lungs; CE, oesophagus. Each lung is conical in shape, and has a broad, concave base, which rests upon the diaphragm. The inner surface of each lung is turned towards the anterior mediastinum, and is adapted to the convex pericardium. The right lung is snorter and wider than the left, and is divided by two notches into three portions or lobes. The left lung has only a single notch and two lobes. Beneath the serous coat, each lung has a layer of cellular membrane, mixed with much elastic tissue, which passes in between the minute air-tubes and air-cells, as described in § 8 of the Fourth Lesson of " Elementary Physiology." In development the lungs first make their appearance as

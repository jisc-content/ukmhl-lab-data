ELEMENTARY ANATOMY. [less. 256 the process of development of human teeth are interestingly illustrated by permanent conditions in other animals. Thus we may have, as in Sharks, an open groove along each jaw, in which groove dermal papillae appear and undergo calcification directly without their becoming enclosed in sacs at all. We may have, as in the Pike, an enclosure of each papilla in a sac, but no development of bone round it, the teeth being attached to the jaw by ligament. We may have teeth which become anchylosed to the summit of the jaw, there being no bony wall (or alveolus) developed on either the inner or the outer side of the teeth, as in certain Lizards (e.g. Psammosaurus), termed Acrodont.1 Fig. 223.â€”Side View of the Skull of a Lizard [Varanus\ with ACRODONT TEETH. a, articular bone of mandible; c, coronoid bone of mandible ; d, dentary ; f, frontal; /', pre-frontal ; / ', post-frontal; /, lachrymal; vi, malar; nix, maxilla; n, nasal , o, pro-otic; parietal; fit, pterygoid ; fit, columella, or dismemberment of pterygoid ; fit", os transversum ; fx, pre-maxiLa ; g, quad- rate bone ; s$, squamosal. We may find a development of a bony alveolar plate on one side (the outer), to which the teeth may become attached by actual bony grovth (anchylosis), as in the Iguanian Lizards. Such a form of attachment is termed fileurodont? We may find two alveolar plates of bone, but no transverse bony partition^, as in Ichthyosaurus. We may find both alveolar plates together with transverse partitions forming distinct alveoli, which nevertheless are incompletely divided one from another at the hinder part of the mouth, as in many of the Dolphin tribe ; and finally, we 1 From uKpoc, sharp, -and <')<W<r, a tooth, ~ From ir\evf>6i, a side, and odoit;.

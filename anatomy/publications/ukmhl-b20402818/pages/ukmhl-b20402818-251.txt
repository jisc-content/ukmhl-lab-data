But this, as we have seen, is a condition which plainly obtains in certain Batra- chians, where the rib not only bifurcates proximally, but also distally. 4. Secondly, as to the question above suggested respecting the " odontoid process " in man. It has been seen how in many animals we have a distinct " odontoid " bone—instead of an odontoid process—interposed between the axis and the atlas ; but we have nowhere observed a fully developed centrum of the atlas co-existing with such an odontoid bone. This fact indicates, what is no doubt the case, that the " odontoid process " is the true centrum of the atlas, united, not with the rest of its own vertebra, but with the centrum of the axis. What, then, is the nature of that transverse bar of bone belonging to the atlas, and passing, in man, in front of and articulating with the odontoid process ? It is probably hypa- pophysial in its nature, as wedge-like hypapophysial ossicles are often developed between the adjacent margins of verte- brae on their ventral aspect, as e.g. beneath the lumbar ver- tebrae of the Mole. It may, however, be an ossification of part of an intervertebral body.

(From the College of Surgeons' Museum.) Thus harmony and unity become manifested by means of a general study of anatomy, which would escape us did we investigate the human structure alone. 5. In considering the most general relations of the human skeleton it will be convenient to imagine the backbone placed horizontally, with the limbs descending at right angles from it, such being the position of the backbone in the great majority of Vertebrates.

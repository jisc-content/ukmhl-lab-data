[less. ELEMENTAR V ANA TOM Y. 366 The cerebro-spinal axis encloses a cavity (of very different size and shape in different parts) which is lined by another very delicate epithelial layer called the ependema. 4. The brain fills up the whole cranial cavity, fitting into all those depressions which we have found to exist on the floor of that cavity. On removing the upper part of the skull and the dura mater, the surface of the brain is seen as a convex mass covered with numerous meandering, contorted prominences {convolutions or gyri), separated by corresponding depres- sions {fissures or sulci). The whole mass is sharply divided by a very deep fissure running from before backwards, and dividing the visible part of the brain into two lateral halves, Fig. 323.â€”The Upper Surface of the Brain of Man, showing the deep longitudinal fissure dividing the two hemispheres, with their numerous and unsymmetrical convolutions- termed hemispheres, and the whole convoluted mass is called the cerebrum. Thus the cerebral hemispheres of man extend so far forwards, outwards, and backwards that no other part of the cerebro-spinal axis is visible when the brain is viewed from above: The pia mater so closely invests this mass that it passes down not only into the great median longitudinal fissure, but into all the sulci of the cerebrum, The dura mater passes into the longitudinal fissure only,where it forms the falx, which, as we have found in some a.iimals {e.g. the Ornithorhynchus), becomes ossified. Upon pushing apart the two cerebral hemispheres, these are seen to be connected by a large transverse band (called

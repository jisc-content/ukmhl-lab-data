They may also periodically develop branched pro- cesses, " antlers," as in Deer. These will be more conveniently considered in the Seventh Lesson. 22. The temporal bone of man is the representative not only of a number of distinct bones in lower animals, but of bones of very differ- ent natures both as to origin and function. What answers to the squamous portion in man, is called the " squa- mosal" in lower animals. In man it is of greater relative size, and takes a larger share in the formation of the inner cranial wall than is the case in most of his class, though, strange to say, it becomes again relatively larger in one of the very lowest of Mammals, i.e. the Echidna. Below the Mammalia it becomes excluded from all share whatever in bounding the cranial cavity, and may be a mere bar contributing to form the bony scaffolding of the skull, as in Lizards or as in bony Fig 99.â€”Upper view of the Fishes. A portion of it may descend Skull of the Tanrec, Hemi- from the cranium altogether, and SSrf'. Sctcht become a mere part of the gill-cover each side. nap, the pre-operculum. The function of suspending the lower jaw is one peculiar to -this element of the skull in Mammals, while in all Vertebrates below Mammals the squamosal has no part in such an office. Amongst his own class, man presents a medium develop- ment of the glenoid surface, which may be much more con- cave than in him (as in Carnivora), or much less so (as in Ruminants). Its antero-posterior concavity is thus most marked in the hard-gripping Badger, where the anterior and posterior bony

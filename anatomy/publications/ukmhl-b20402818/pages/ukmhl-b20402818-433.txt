397 THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. the muscles of the mouth, nose, and eyelids, and to the skin of the neck; it also sends a long and slender branch to the stylo- hyoid muscle. The other part, called the chorda tymftani, comes out at the inner side of the Glasserian fissure, skirts the processus gracilis of the malleus, and runs along within the mandible to the sub-maxillary ganglion, in close juxtapo- sition with a branch of the third division of the fifth nerve. These relations are constant, so that the seventh nerve divides into two branches, which respectively go to the anterior and posterior boundaries of that visceral cleft which divides the mandibular and hyoidean arches. In some of the lower Vertebrates the fifth and seventh nerves are much blended, and the two may, as in the Frog, be completely united at the large ganglion at the root of the former. 25. The EIGHTH nerve is a very complex structure, and consists of at least three nerves united together, and all arising from the medulla oblongata and passing out by the jugular foramen. The first of these, called the glosso-ftharyngeal, supplies Fig. 349.—Nervous Supply of the Hinder Part of the Right Side of the Head of the Shark Hexaiichus g-> iSens.

ELEMENTAR Y ANA TOMY. of the orbit it passes through a fibro-cartilaginous ring or pulley, which changes the direction of the tendon, as, after traversing it, the tendon returns backwards to be inserted between the upper and external recti muscles. The obliquus inferior has no pulley, and is the only short muscle in the orbit. It springs from the orbital plate of the maxilla near the lachrymal groove, and, passing backwards between the floor of the orbit and the globe of the eye, is inserted into the postero-external aspect of the latter. The platysma myoides is a thin muscle placed imme- diately beneath the skin of the neck, and extending from the mandible downwards to the chest and shoulders. The sterno-cleido mastoid is a long stout muscular strap, double at its lower end and arising partly from the clavicle and partly from the sternum, and inserted into the mastoid process. The digastric is a muscle with two fleshy bellies, with a median tendon. Arising from the mastoid, it is inserted inside the mandible close to the symphysis. The median tendon is connected with the os hyoides.

The stylo-hyoid, stylo-glossus, and stylo-pha?yngeus are three slender muscles all springing from the styloid process, and inserted, the first into the corniculum of the hyoid, the second into the base of the tongue, and the third into the thyroid cartilage of the larynx.1 The ?nylo-hyoid is a flat muscle, and passes from inside the mandible to the body of the hyoid. It unites with its fellow 1 For a description of the larynx see Lesson XII.

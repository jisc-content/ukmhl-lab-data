Such teeth, specially adapted for gnawing, as we so often know to our cost as regards the Rat, are denser on the front surface than elsewhere, so that the action of gnawing, as it wears away more quickly the softer part behind, keeps a constantly sharp chisel-shaped edge in front. Animals which have teeth thus formed are apt to suffer fatally from the loss of one, as, there being then nothing to wear away its natural opponent of the opposite jaw, the latter continues to grow and complete that (Typical Rodent Dentition.) a, angle of mandible ; c, occipital condyle ; cr, coronoid process of mandible ; cy, condyle of mandible ; f, frontal ; z, incisor teeth ; j, ascending branch of maxilla enclosing the enormous infra-orbital foramen, the course of the masseter muscle through which is indicated by an arrow ; m, molar teeth ; mx, maxilla ; n, nasal ; J>m, premolar teeth ; pm, paramastoid process ; px, premaxilla; /. tympanic bone ; z, zygomatic arch—the part formed by the malar. circle of which its axis (from root to apex) describes a seg- ment.

They may, on the contrary, as in all carinate, or ordinary Birds, be so placed that the coracoid forms with the scapula an acute angle open backwards. To the parts which represent the scapula and coracoid in osseous Fishes, the names of ulna and radius have sometimes been respectively applied. The coracoid may attain a pro- digious size, as e.g. in the Opah fish {Lampris). Fig. 134.—Bones of the Right Arm and Shoulder of the Small T a n r e c—Hem icen tetes. This view shows the elongated scapula with blunt metacromion and very small coracoid; also the largely-developed clavicle attached to the end of.the acromion and projecting freely—the humerus with the prominent deltoid ridge (or crest) and the radius applied closely in front of the ulna, which latter bone has a well-developed olecranon. 12. The apparent simplicity of the CLAVICLE in man would liardly allow of a correct a priori conjecture as to the

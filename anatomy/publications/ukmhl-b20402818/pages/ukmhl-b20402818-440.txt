Moreover, these branches are connected together on each side (near their origins) by commissural nerve-fibres, and it is these two linear series of commissures (enlarged into ganglia at their successive points of junction) which constitute the two longitudinal gangliated cords before spoken of. It is the presence of these commissural cords which makes so marked a contrast between the sympathetic system and the other branches of the spinal nerves, which in man exhibit no signs of such continuous longitudinal union. But an extended survey shows us that these latter (the undoubted spinal nerves) may also be connected together by similar axially extended commissural cords, for such do exist in the class of Fishes. The sympathetic nerves of the viscera present three great complications, termed (1) the cardiac plexus, (2) the solar plexus, and (3) the hypogastric plexus : these are placed respec- tively above the heart, behind the stomach, and in the pelvis.

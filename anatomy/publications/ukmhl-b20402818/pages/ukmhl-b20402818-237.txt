v.] SKELETON OF LOWER LIMB. great size, as e.g. in the This process may attain a very Omithorhynchus and Echidna. In man alone does the external malleolus descend greatly below the internal malleolus. The lower end of the fibula may be very much enlarged, as in the Hippopotamus. Its lower end may develop a conical process, which, turning in- wards, may fit into a depression on the outer side of the articular surface of the astragalus, as in the Sloth. 15. Inasmuch as the FOOT of man is made up of the tarsus, metatarsus, and phalanges, it agrees with the same part in Mammals and Batrachians. In Birds, however, the proxi- mal part of the tarsus is an- chylosed with, and in Reptiles more or less firmly united with, the tibia, so that the visible foot of Birds corresponds but with the greater portion and not the whole of the foot of man. The foot, in one aspect, is less constant than the hand, as ele- ments of the leg (as in Balcena and Bod) may be present while there is no rudiment whatever of the foot. 16. In that the TARSUS of man contains certain small and dis- tinct bones, it agrees with the same part in all Vertebrates above Fishes, except Birds (in which the tarsus coalesces with other portions of the skeleton), and except also certam Tailed-Batrachians, in which the constituent parts of the tarsus remain more or less permanently cartilaginous. The number of ossicles, or cartilages, may be as many as nine, as in the Salamander ; or may be reduced to three, as in Proteus, Bufo bifurcatus, and Lacerta agilisj or perhaps to two, in Ophiodes striatus. We have seen that part of the carpus of man may be represented by more elongated bones, as in the Crocodile. thorhynchus paradoxus* /, femur ; t, tibia; /', fibula ; patella.

Inasmuch, however, as man's dorsal vertebrae form a series the first of which bears ribs which join a sternum, man agrees with all Vertebrates (ex- cept Serpents) above the Ichthyopsida ; but he differs from the whole of the last-named vast group, as in that group there is either no sternum or else no ribs which join it. In their number the dorsal vertebrae of man are a little below the average of his class, in which the number may be augmented to twenty, as in the Elephant, or doubled {i.e. twenty-four) as in the Two-toed Sloth, or on the other hand reduced to ten, as in Azara's Armadillo. Comparing the condition existing in man with that in the Non-Mammalian Vertebrates above Fishes, we find his number to be smaller than that in most Reptiles, but somewhat greater than in Birds, where, on account of the prodigiously enlarged sacrum, but three (e.g. Ciconia alba), seven or nine, or, very rarely, eleven vertebrae are reckoned as dorsal. In the main proportions of the centrum (the greater height in proportion to breadth, smaller medullary canal, elongated spinous processes, the articular process, short transverse processes, and considerable lateral notches), these vertebrae in man agree with those of other Mammals. Often, however, the spinous processes may be very much more prolonged, as in the Ungulata {e.g. the Ox and the Horse), or they may be swollen at their summits, and more or less anchylosed together, as sometimes in the true Opossums. On the other hand, they are sometimes almost or quite absent, as in Bats. ns i6 Ajo Fig. 56. â€”Diagram of a Section of Shell of a Tortoise made trans- versely to the long axis of the Skeleton. ns, neural spine; r, rib ; ic and hp, ventral plates not belonging to the true axial skeleton.

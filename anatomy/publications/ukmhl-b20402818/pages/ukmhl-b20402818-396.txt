The interossei of the human foot are peculiar, as in all Apes (even in the Gorilla) they resemble in arrange- ment the interossei of the hand, owing to the arising of the fibular interosseus of the second digit from the middle meta- llic. 320. â€”Deeper Front View of Right Leg of Parson's Chameleon.

They are nearly constant muscles, and are largely developed even in Batrachians, as in the Frog, which animal possesses indeed a singularly rich myological furniture of the foot. In the Bat there are two interossei to each toe. They may consist, as in the Horse, of two small muscles, one being placed between the styliform and the large metacarpal on each side. 28. Thus, as might have been expected, man's muscles follow the type exhibited by his class and order, still pre-

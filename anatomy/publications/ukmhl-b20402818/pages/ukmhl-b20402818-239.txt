SKELETON OF LOWER LIMB. 205 17. The BONES OF THE PROXIMAL PART OF THE TARSUS are always the largest and most important. The astragalus and os calcis, and probably also the naviculare, may be represented by a single bone, as in many Lizards, and they may intimately fuse at an early age with the distal end of the tibia, as in almost all Birds. In this latter case these bones unite very early into one, which remains long distinct from the tibia, only in the Ostrich, Rhea, and Emeu ; and for some time after hatching in the Dorking Fowl.

In Lizards this compound bone is extended transversely, but very little backwards. It articulates with both the tibia and fibula above, and has an irregular surface below for the reception of the more distal tarsal bones.

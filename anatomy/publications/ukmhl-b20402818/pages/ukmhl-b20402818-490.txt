[less. ELEMENTARY ANATOMY, it is almost always very.much more simple. Thus, in Fishes the liver consists generally of one undivided mass, or of two lobes, as in the Cod ; or three, as in the Carp and Rays—very rarely of more, as in the Tunny. In Reptiles the liver is single, as in the Chameleon and Serpents, or consists of two lobes, as in the Crocodile. In Birds there are also two lobes, to which sometimes (as e.g. in the Swan) there is added a small intermediate lobe at the back, which has been deemed to answer to man's Spi- gelian lobe. It is in man's own class, however, that the varieties greatest both in number and interest present themselves.

The arrow- points to the vena cava. The study of them has led to the perception that the most definite and typical structure of the liver is as follows :—(1), A Spigelian and (2) caudate lobe, each defined as in man ; (3 and 4) two divisions of that part of the liver which lies on the left side of the broad ligament, and which are named respectively the " lateral left lobe * and the " central left lobe;" (5), the ( lobe which supports the gall-bladder, and which is called the cystic, or "central right lobe;" (6), the extreme right part of the great right lobe, often separated from the central right lobe by a fissure, and named the ^lateral right lobe."

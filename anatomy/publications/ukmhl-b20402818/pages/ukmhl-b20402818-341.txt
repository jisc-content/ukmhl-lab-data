viii.] THE MUSCLES. 305 A remarkable muscle, the peroneus longtts, arises from the outer, upper two-thirds of the fibula and from the ex- ternal tuberosity of the tibia. It ends in a tendon which passes behind the external malleolus, and then obliquely across the sole of the foot to the first metatarsal. The peroneus brevis springs from the outer, lower half of the fibula, and ends in a tendon which, also passing behind Fig. 280.—Superficial Flexor Muscles of Right Leg. 1, tendon of semi-membranosus; 2, 2, heads of gastrocnemius ; 3, plantaris ; 4, soleus; 5, great tendon of gastrocnemius, continuous below with (6) the tendo Achillis ; 7, peroneus longus; 8, peroneus brevis; 9, flexor Ion gus digitorum pedis ; 10, tibialis posticus. the external malleolus, is inserted into the base of the fifth metatarsal. Behind the leg we have seven muscles. The gastrocnemius (forming the bulk of the calf of the leg) consists of two fleshy heads, arising each by a thick tendon from above each of the condyles of the femur—one external, one internal.

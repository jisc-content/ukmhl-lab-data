[less. be reduced to a minimum, as in the Horse; or be split up into three portions, as in the Iguana; or into seven small muscles all arising from about the central tarsal ossicle or the end of the fibula, and going to the five metatarsals, as in Chamceleo Parsonii—with other almost endless variations in different forms. Fig. 315.—Muscles ok LepT Hind Leg of Hyrax. Ta, tibialis anticus ; Eld, extensor longus digitorum (the origin of this muscle ought to have been carried up to the femur); PI, peroneus longus (this muscle ought not to have been made to arise from the femur); Pb, peroneus brevis; .9, soleus ; G, gastrocnemius ; P, plantaris. The peronei muscles may be much more largely developed than in man. Thus in the Hare four such muscles, not in- cluding the peroneus longus, send tendons to the second,

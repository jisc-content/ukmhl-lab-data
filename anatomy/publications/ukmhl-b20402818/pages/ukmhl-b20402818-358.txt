ELEMENTARY ANATOMY, [LESS. 322 man shares with his class, but which may have no distinct representative in non-mammalian forms which are higher than Batrachians, e.g. in the Iguana. The splenitis colli is present only in a few Mammals. The erector spince presents in man a degree of differentia- tion not generally found in animals below his class. Thus in the Iguana and Chameleon it is but divisible into the longi- tudinal parts answering respectively to the longissimus dorsi Fig. 290.—Deeper Muscles of Outer Side of hinder part of Trunk and * anterior part of tail, and of the dorsal (extensor) slde of rlght Pelvic Limb of Menobranchits—the gluteus maximus, rectus femoris, and extensor longus digitorum being cut and reflected. EH, extensor hallucis ; ELD, extensor longus digitorum; ExO, external oblique ; EC, femoro-caudal; G, gracilis; GMd, gluteus medius; GMi, gluteus minimus; GMx and RF, great extensors of thigh; /, iliacus (?); IlC, ilio caudal ; IP, iiio-peroneal ; S, sartorius ; SM, semi-membranosus ; ST, semi-tendinosus ; TA and TA I, tibialis anticus. and sacro lumbalis, and continuing, with the intervention of certain neck muscles, from the cranium to the end of the dorsum of the tail. But a greater simplicity still may exist, as in Tailed-Batrachians (e.g. Menopoma and Me?iobranchus), where, without the intervention of any such neck muscles, a simple, or more or less tendinously intersected muscular mass extends from the skull directly to the end of the dorsum of the tail. This dorsal muscle may be reduced to a mere rudi-

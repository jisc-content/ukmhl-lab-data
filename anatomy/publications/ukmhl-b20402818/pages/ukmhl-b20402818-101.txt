II.] THE SPI 1ST A L SKELETON. 67 divided into a median and two lateral processes, one on each side (as in the Apteryx) ; or into a median process and four lateral ones—there being an internal and external xiphoid process on each side of the median one—as in very many birds {e.g. gallinaceous birds, such as the Fowl and Pheasant). This median process it is which bears the keel, or the greater part of the keel, in Birds. Fig. 77.—Thorax of a Gallinaceous bmo. k, keel of entro-sternum ; m, middle xiphoid process ; i, intermediate xiphoid process ; e, external xiphoid process ; r, rostrum ; c, costal process ; A, hypa- pophysis ; a, appendage from ribs, or zmcinate process. In certain animals (e.g. the Monotremes) there is a median ossicle in front of the manubrium, which is often called the episternum. This really forms part of the appendicular skeleton, being a portion of the shoulder structure. It will therefore be noticed under that head. 35. In possessing RIBS (that is, distinct osseous or cartila- ginous parts attached at one end to the vertebral column, and tending to surround the body cavity) man agrees with the immense majority of other Vertebrates. Some, however, as the Frogs and Toads, have none, nor can any be said to exist in some of the lowest Fishes, e.g. the Lamprey and its allies. In the division of the ribs into two categories, the " true " and the " false " ribs, man agrees with all animals which have ribs at all, except Serpents, Fishes, and Chelonians ; Serpents F 2

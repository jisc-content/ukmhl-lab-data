ELEMENTARY ANA TOMY. 452 [less. border of the liver, on the right-hand side of the fissure of the ductus venosus. It is bounded behind and on its own right side by a short and deep fissure (or rather fossa) called the fissure of the vena cava, because that large vein runs along it. In front the Spigelian lobe is bounded by the transverse or portal fissure, which crosses the under surface of the left half of the right lobe of the liver, and runs, almost at right angles, into the longitudinal fissure. It is into this fissure that the portal vein, the hepatic artery, and the great nerves enter, and it is from it that the bile-duct proceeds to convey away the biliary secretion. -The portal fissure runs to the right, beyond the limits of the Spigelian lobe. That part of the substance of the liver which is situate behind this outer part of the portal fissure is called the caudate lobe (Fig. 385, c), and is a sort ot Fig. 383.—The Liver viewed from below. a, vena cava ; b, vena porta? ; c, the ductus communis choledochus ; d, hepatic artery; /, gall-bladder. ridge which proceeds from the base of the Spigelian lobe to the under surface of the great right lobe, and is in part limited behind by the vena cava. That part of the right lobe which is in front of the portal, or transverse, fissure is marked by a depression in which lies a pear-shaped bag, called the gall- bladder, which has its blind end (or fundus) forwards. The anterior end of this depression often notches the anterior margin of the great right lobe of the liver (Fig. 385, cf). The bile, or hepatic, duct descends from the portal fissure, in front of the vena porta, and meets the duct of the gall- bladder—termed the cystic duct—at an acute angle. The common duct formed by the union of these two is called the ductus communis choledochus, and this passes into the duodenum side by side'with the pancreatic duct, the two opening into the intestine by a common orifice.

THE SPINAL SKELETON. II.J 31 mentioned as correspondingly situate on the axis vertebra. The upper pair of surfaces, which are larger and more cup-shaped; articulate with two prominences on the base of the skull. The atlas vertebra is formed to turn on the odontoid pro- cess of the axis as on a pivot. This is further explained in the Seventh Lesson of " Elementary Physiology." 12. Having noted the characters of vertebras above the typical dorsal ones, those below (i.e. the lower dorsal and lumbar) come next. The lower dorsal vertebras have their centra larger than those of the upper, while their transverse processes become shorter, and their articular processes change their direction, the upper zygapophyses looking obliquely inwards, the lower ones obliquely outwards. Finally, their neural spines project less downwards. In the last dorsal vertebra a small rounded prominence arises from the posterior margin of each upper articular process. This prominence is termed the mammillary process, or Metapophysis.1 Another small prominence projects backwards from between the upper articular process and the transverse pro- cess, and is ealled an Anapophysis.2 Fig. 43â€”A Lumbar Vertebra. c, centrum ; s, neural spine ; t, tubercular process; z, prezygapophysis; z, postzygapophysis ; m, metapophysis ; a, anapophysis. The LUMBAR vertebra have their centra still more mas- sive than the dorsal centra, and deeper in front than behind. The neural spines are all more massive, and project directly backwards instead of downwards. The transverse processes are larger, and there are no tuber- cular or capitular surfaces, and no process in the place of the latter, as are found in the cervical vertebras. 1 From perd, after, and apophysis.

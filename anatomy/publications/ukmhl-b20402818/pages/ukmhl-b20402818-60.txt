[LESS. ELEMENTAR Y ANA TOMY. 1 From 7rpo£, £vyov, a yoke, and an6<pvcric. looks mainly backwards. This is called the superior articular process* or prezygapophysis, and each dorsal vertebra has, of course, a pair of such. From the lower and outer side of each lamina a small process projects downwards, with a smooth surface on it which looks mainly forwards. This is called the inferior articular process, or postzygapophysis, and there are two to every vertebra of the back. The articular surfaces of the two inferior articular pro- cesses are applied to the articular surfaces of the two superior articular processes of the next vertebra below. Ligamentous fibres bind together the margins of the apposed articular surfaces, between which is placed a sac containing synovial fluid. The upper margin of each pedicle is somewhat concave, while its lower margin is more so. In this way, when the vertebras are naturally articulated together, a rounded opening appears between each pair of adjacent pedicles. These openings give exit to spinal nerves coming out from the spinal marrow enclosed within the neural arches. Two other articular surfaces on each side should be noted : one at the outer side of the posterior and outer angle of the centrum at its junction with the pedicle, the other at the anterior aspect of the end of the transverse process. The first of these articular sources is termed " capitular" and the second " tubercular? for reasons which will appear later. The diameter of the centrum from side to side exceeds but little its diameter from behind forwards.

Of the seven cervical vertebrae, the first two are sufficiently exceptional to demand separate notice. Any

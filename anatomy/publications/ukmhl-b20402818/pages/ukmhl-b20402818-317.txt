VIII,] THE MUSCLES. 281 LESSON VIII. THE MUSCLES. 1. The MUSCLES of man are his "flesh," and it is the muscles of cattle which are eaten as " the lean " of " meat." These muscles are fleshy masses of different sizes and shapes, separated from each other by membranes termed aponeuroses. Aponeuroses are included amongst those fibrous and soft parts of the skeleton (referred to in Lesson II.) which extend outwards from the bones of the endo- skeleton to the skin, or exo-skeleton. The nature of muscular tissue has already been sufficiently described in the " Elementary Physiology," Lesson XII. § 15 ; the action of muscles in Lesson VII. § 4 ; their fixed points, §§ 5 and 6 ; the kinds of movement they give rise to, § 17; and their modes of attachment in § 19. 2. That end of a muscle which is nearest to the central axis of the whole body, or to the root, or else to the axis of the limb of which it forms part, is generally called its ORIGIN, and its proximal end. The opposite extremity is generally called its insertion, and its distal end. Muscles are very often inserted into bones by means of tendons, and then frequently, when such muscles are strong, part of the bone extends out, as it were, a little way into the substance of the tendons. Hence arise many such tuberosi- ties, spinous processes, &c., as we have already made ac- quaintance with. All the processes of the backbone are so connected with tendons of muscles. 3. Muscles acting on bony levers produce definite MO- TIONS, in consequence of which certain epithets are applied to such muscles. Thus, when two bones are united by a hinge-joint, muscles which by their contraction tend to make the angle formed by

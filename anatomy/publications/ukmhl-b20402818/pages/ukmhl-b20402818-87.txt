THE SPINAL SKELETON. 53 The total absence of articular processes is a character common to man's class, but in Birds and in some Reptiles {e.g. the Iguana) postzygapophyses are present. The spinous tubercle may be enlarged into a distinct pointed process, as in some Baboons. The neural spine may be detached from the neural arcs, as in the Crocodile and Tunny. It may, as in the fish Ephippus, be separated from its centrum by the intrusion of the skull wall ; the inferior tubercle may be drawn out into a long process, as in the Hare, or be doubled, as in the Duck-billed Platypus. Occasionally, as in Yig. 67.â€”Latekai., Dorsal, and Ventral View of First Vertebra of Amphiuma. Amphiuma, the body of the first vertebra may send out a process towards the head, reminding us of the odontoid process of the axis. The slenderness of the neural arch and transverse processes is exceptional in man. The arch may be open medianly above, as in the Frog. The transverse process is expanded into a large plate in almost all beasts below Primates, but it may be short and imperforate, as in the common Fin Whale. The canal for the vertebral artery is generally more com- plex (through increase of ossification) in beasts than in man, where indeed the osseous canal is simple. Transverse processes are also generally absent or rudimentary below Mammals, though the Crocodiles have them very long and rib-like. The free condition of the atlas is not universal, as it is anchylosed to the axis in the Dolphin, and with all the other cervicals in the Right Whale. It may be fused in one solid mass with the skull, as in the Sturgeon, or with a certain number of succeeding vertebras, as in the Rays. It may be firmly united by suture with both, as in the Ganoid fish Bagrus (see Fig. 61). The anterior base of the atlas may be un- ossified, as in the Wombat, or may remain a distinct bone, as in the Thylacine. The real nature of this part will appear shortly.

VIII.] 283 THE MUSCLES. general considerations, however, will be more profitable after a review of the muscles as they exist in man, and of the more interesting and significant deviations from his structure which may be found in other animals. The viscero-skeletal system of muscles consists of muscular fibres placed on the walls of the alimentary canal, and in a variety of tubes and organs (such as the heart, bladder, &c), to be hereafter noticed in describing such parts. 5. It may be useful and convenient in this book to adopt the order usually followed in describing man's anatomy. The muscles OF the head and neck will therefore come first.

Occipito-frontalis is the name applied to a thin flat muscle, divided into two fleshy parts, or bellies. One of these is placed in the occiput and another over the orbits, and the two are connected by a wide aponeurosis which covers the top of the skull and passes immediately beneath the skin. Three little muscles, termed respectively the attollens

ELEMENTAR Y ANA TOMY. 28S [less. The omo-hyoid is a long digastric muscle which takes origin from the hyoid and is inserted into the upper margin of the scapula. The anterior scalenus lies deep at the side of the neck. It springs from the parapophyses of the cervical vertebras (third to sixth), and is inserted into the first rib. The middle scalenus springs from the diapophyses of the cervical vertebrae, and also goes to the first rib. The posterior scalenus arises from the diapophyses of the last two or three cervical vertebrae, and is inserted into the second rib. The rectus capitis anticus major arises from the parapo- physes of the (third to sixth) cervical vertebrae, and is in- serted into the basi-occipital. The rectus capitis aiiticus minor springs from the side of the atlas, and also goes to the basi-occipital. . The rectus lateralis is a short muscle interposed between the transverse process of the atlas and the jugular process of the occipital bone. The longus colli is attached to the front of the spine, con- necting the centra and transverse processes of the vertebrae from the atlas down to the third dorsal.

The constrictors of the pharynx are muscles which enclose the alimentary canal in the region of the throat : they are three in number (inferior, middle, and superior), and spring -i -8 -9

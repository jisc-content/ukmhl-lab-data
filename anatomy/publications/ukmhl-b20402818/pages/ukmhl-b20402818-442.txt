4°6 ELEMENTARY ANATOMY. [less. LESSON X. THE CIRCULATING SYSTEM. 1. The CIRCULATING SYSTEM comprises the various chan- nels or vessels by which the nutritive fluid of the body—the blood—is conveyed to and from every part of the organism. These vessels are of various and very different sizes. The largest and most complex part of the circulating' system is the heart, which may be considered as the central portion, all the other channels being subsidiary to it. These latter may be divided into three categories : (A), the vessels taking blood from the heart—which vessels are called arteries; (B), the vessels taking blood towards the heart— which are the veins; and (C), the minute tubes {capillaries) which convey the blood to the tissues, and intervene between and connect the ends of the arteries and veins—being dis- tinguished from both those kinds of vessels by the absence of muscular fibres in their walls. In addition to these vessels, which with the heart constitute what may be called the true circulating system, there are yet other vessels, lymphatics and lacteals, which convey fluid from almost all parts of the body into the veins—to which they thus form as it were a supplementary addition. The fluids these vessels convey into the veins are (i) the colourless portions of the blood which have exuded from the capillaries, and (2) nutritive juices from the walls of the ali- mentary canal. All these parts have been so fully described—not only as regards their function, but also as regards their structure—in Lesson II. §§ 1 —11 of " Elementary Physiology," as to render unnecessary much which must otherwise have been here detailed. 2. The heart in man, its form, cavities, apertures, valves, &c, have all been described and figured in the " Elementary

x.] THE CIRCULATING SYSTEM. 4:7 with three corresponding vessels going to the dorsal aorta, on each side—direct communications taking place between pa. dxL aa. Fig. 359.—The Circulation of a Tadpole in its primitive stage, when nearly all the blood is distributed to the gills ; the pulmonary arteries being quite rudimentary, and the vessel (or ductus Botalli) connecting together the bran- chial artery and vein at the root of each gill, being minute. a, bulbus aorta; ; ba, branchial arteries; br^^br2, and £r3, the three gills (or branchiae of each side); bv, the branchial veins which bring back the blood from the gills—the hindmost pair of branchial veins on each side unite to form an aortic arch {aa), which again unites with its fellow of the opposite side to form da, the descending (or dorsal) aorta. The branchial veins of the foremost gills gives rise to the carotid arteries, cc. o, artery going to the orbit ; pa, pulmonary artery ; 1, 2, 3, anastomosing branches connecting together the adjacent branchial arteries and veins. neighbouring arteries and veins (by what is called a ductus Botalli), in spite of each artery and vein minutely dividing in the gill beyond such points of communication. Fig. 360.—The Circulation in a Tadpole at a more advanced stage, when the gills have begun to be absorbed, the pulmo- nary arteries to increase, as also the con- necting branches (at the root of the gills) between the branchial arteries and branchial veins. The letters refer to the same parts as in Fig. 359. Fig. 361.—The Circulation in a Young Frog. Here the gills have been absorbed, and the blood passes directly from the heart to the head, the dorsal aorta, the lungs, and the skin. The letters refer to the same parts as in Fig. 359. Again, we may find, as in the adult Frog, three aortic arches on each side, whereof the first is the common carotid, the

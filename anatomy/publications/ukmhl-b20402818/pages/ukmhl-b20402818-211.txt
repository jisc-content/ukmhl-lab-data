SKELETON OF LOWER LIMB. 177 N LESSON V. THE SKELETON OF THE LOWER LIMB. 1. The skeleton of the lower limbs, like that of the upper, is divisible into three categories : A, that of the hip ; B, that of the leg ; and C, that of the foot. A. The skeleton of the hip, or the haunch-bone, is called /, the os iunominatttm? and there is one such on each side in the adult man. B. The skeleton of the leg is subdivisible into— (a) That of the thigh, which consists but of one bone, called the femur (os femoris). (b) That of the lower part of the leg, which consists of two bones placed side by side. The larger of these is called the tibia ; the other, much more slender and placed on the outer side of the leg, is called the fibula, or peroneal2 bone of the leg. C. The skeleton of the foot is subdivisible into three parts : (a) that of the ankle, the tarsus;3 (b) that of the middle part of the foot, the metatarsus; and (c) that of the toes, or digits—composed of the phalanges. 2. The OS innominatum is a very large bone, meeting with its fellow of the other side in the mid-ventral line of the body, and being strongly attached to the sacrum behind , thus forming, with the intervention of the last-named bone, a solid bony girdle, supporting the trunk above, and being itself im- posed on the limbs below—the head of the thigh-bone fitting into a socket on the outer side of the os innominatum. Each os innominatum is made up originally of three dis- tinct bones, which become united when youth is merging into manhood. These three bones are the ilium, the ischium, and the pubis. 1 From its not bearing any special resemblance to any one object. 2 So called because it clasps the larger bone of the leg, nepovn, a clasp. 3 From Tapcog, a crate.

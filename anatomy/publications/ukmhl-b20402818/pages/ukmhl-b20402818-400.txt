[less. ELEMENTARY ANATOMY. 3^4 Considered independently of the bony skeleton, the muscu- lar system may, as its simplest expression, be conceived as a fleshy, antero-posteriorly extended envelope of the body, cut up, at regular intervals, into a series of successive segments, by means of transverse aponeurotic membranes extending outwards from the body axis to the skin. X From this primitive condition the muscles of the back may be conceived as arising by means of increasing obliquity, 4 3 Fig. 322—Diagram of Caudal Muscles of RrGHT Side of Tail of Iguana, showing the obliquity of the aponeurotic intersections of the muscular portions which are themselves drawn out into cones yet preserving a numerical relation to the supporting veitebrse. N, neural spine : H, hypapophysial spine ; 2, zygapophysis ; t, transverse pro- cess ; 1, dorsal series of cones; 2, upper lateral series of cones ; 3, lower series of cones ; 4, ventral series of conss. conical prolongation, and partial detachment (from muscle) of the aponeuroses, together with condensation of their pro- duced ends till the latter become firm tendons, directed more or less obliquely forwards—the muscular fibres, in the mean- while, taking slightly different directions at different depths. The muscles of the abdomen may be conceived as arising through atrophy of the transverse aponeuroses (of which the linece transversa of the rectus are the last remains) and differentiation of the muscular mass into superimposed sheets of differently directed fibres. The muscles of the limbs may be conceived 1 as arising as conical sheaths of muscular fibres investing protruding limb- rudiments, and becoming divided and annexed to successive limb-segments as such limb-rudiments become developed and segmented—finally assuming the form of a median and two lateral groups of muscles both on the extensor and flexor surfaces of each limb. 1 As has been suggested by Professor Humphrey, F.R.S.

ELEMENTARY ANATOMY. [less. opens near the wide left end, or fundus of the stomach, which part is called its ca?-diac part. The opposite end, or py/orus, leads into the intestine—the muscular fibres project- ing, at the point of junction, so as to form a sort of valve.

On extending our view over Vertebrates generally, we see that the oesophagus may be very short and wide; as in most Fishes ; also that it may be exceedingly distensible, as in Serpents. It may be furnished with long, hard, conical papilla?, directed backwards, as in Chelonians. It may have a special sac-like dilatation attached towards its lower part, as in most Birds (Fig. 378, cfi), where this por- tion is called the crop, which may be double, as in Pigeons.

THE EXTERNAL SKELETON. V1T.] 2-15 The human nails differ in shape from those of almost every other animal, in that they so little tend to surround or enclose the ends of either the fingers or toes. The nail at its maximum of development quite surrounds and encloses the last joint of the digit which bears it, and is then called a hoof, as we may see in the Horse or Ox. It may be produced into a sharp point, when it is called a claw, as in the familiar case of the Cat, and in Birds. The nails may, on the other hand, be much reduced in size, and not nearly extend to the end of the digits which support them, as in the Sea Bear. They may be altogether wanting in man's own class, as in the Porpoise, or obtain a prodigious relative size, so that the body can be suspended by them, in progression, as in the Sloth. The little Bats of our own country hang, indeed, by hook-like claws when at rest ; either by the claws of the toes or the two thumb-claws. The nail of one digit may differ in form from all the others, as in that of the second toe of Lemurs and of the Hyrax. The nail makes its appearance in its greatest simplicity in certain Toads and one of the Efts, where it is merely a slight thickening of the epidermis at the ends of the digits. 12. Ecteronic appendages not found in man make their appearance in other animals. Thus, in the Rhinoceros we meet with a horn (or even two—one in front of the other), entirely destitute of a bony core, and growing like a great blunt nail from the dorsum of the muzzle, long dermal papilla? extending into it and answering to the dermal ridges beneath the human nail. No less than three long horns are developed in Owen's Chameleon—one from the nose, and a symmetrical pair from the front of the head. Other horns which do possess bony cores are developed from the head in pairs in the so-called hollow-horned Rumi- nants, i.e. the Oxen, Antelopes, Goats, and Sheep ; and only in one anomalous form, the Prongbock {Antilocapra), are

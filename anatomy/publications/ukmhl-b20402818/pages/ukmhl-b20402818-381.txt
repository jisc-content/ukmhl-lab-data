The tendon of a muscle which seems to answer to the rectus femoris may end by uniting with the plantaris, as in the Alligator and in Birds, in which the plantaris is the perforated flexor of the toes, as it is also in the Rabbit. Fig. 310.â€”Deeper Muscles of Inner Aspfct of Right Pelvic Limb of Parson's Chameleon. A, adductor; B, biceps; E1 and E2, extensores metatarsorum ; EL, extensor longus digitorum ; E1 and E2, rectus femoris ; EDr, flexor longus digitorum; G, gracilis ; GE, gastrocnemius externus ; GI, gastrocnemius internus ; /, iliacus; IP, ilio-peroneal; S, tibial adductor; ST, semi-tendinosus; TA, tibialis anticus; V1, vastus internus. The vastus internus may be almost absent, as in the Three- toed Sloth, and the rectus may be but imperfectly differen- tiated from the deeper part of the extensor, as is the case in Bats. The rectus may, on the contrary, be very large and consist of two muscles with distinct origins, as in the Alligator, Iguana, Menopoma, and Menobranchus. The vasti and cru- reus may be absent, as in the two last-named genera. The gracilis in man is an exceptionally narrow and weak

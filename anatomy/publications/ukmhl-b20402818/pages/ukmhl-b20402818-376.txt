ELEMENTARY ANA TO MY. [less. 34° rarely the diaphragm may contain a sesamoid bone, as in the Camel. There may be no tendinous centre, this being absent in the Porpoise. In Reptiles (e.g. I guana) a. muscle, the retrahentes costarum, (which appears to have no representa- tive in man), arises by muscular fibres from the sides of the bodies of the trunk vertebrae, and is inserted by aponeurosis into the inside of the seventh and eighth cervical ribs, and into the seven following ribs. In Tailed-Batrachians (e.g. Menopoma) this muscle is very fleshy at its an- terior end, and is carried forward beneath the basis cranii. 25. Of the MUSCLES OF THE IN- FERIOR extremity. The psoas mag- nus may be very much larger relatively than in man (thus it is exceedingly large in the Rabbit and Agouti), or it may be (as in Birds and the common Seal) entirely wanting. It has been supposed that the great muscular mass which in Cetaceans (e.g. the Porpoise) and the Seals extends forward beneath the trunk part of the spine from be- neath its caudal part, is a psoas. This is not the case, however—it is a sacro-coccygeus extraordinarily pro- longed forwards. lliacus. This muscle may be want- ing, as in the Whales and Seals ; or relatively enormous, as in the Bats, where it is inserted separately from the psoas, and below the latter. The iliacus (or else the psoas) may extend its origin up to the last two dorsal vertebrae, as in Nycticebus. The psoas parvus may be altogether wanting, as in Cetaceans and Birds. It may be as large as the psoas mag- nus, as in the Pig, or ten times larger, as in the Kangaroo.. A muscle may exist which extends from the coccygeal region of the backbone to the femur, but which has no certain Fro. 305.—Sub VERTEBRAL Muscles of Right Side of Iguana.

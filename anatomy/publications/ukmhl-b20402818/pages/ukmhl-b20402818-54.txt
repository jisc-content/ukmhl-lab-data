[less. 22 ELRMENTAR Y ANA TOMY. LESSON II. THE SKELETON IN GENERAL, THE INTERNAL SKELETON, THE BACKBONE, BREASTBONE, AND RIBS. i. The word " Skeleton"1 is popularly taken to denote only the bones, or at most the bone and gristle which form the internal support of the body. An acquaintance with other animal structures, however, shows that this signification is far too restricted ; for parts which are bony in man may be cartilaginous {i.e. of gristle) or even merely membranous, in other animals; and conversely, parts sometimes quite external, which are merely fibrous in man, may be horn or bone, or contain bones and cartilages, in other animals. The nature and structure of fibrous tissue,2 of cartilage, and of bone, have been sufficiently described in the first and twelfth lessons of the "Elementary Physiology." It may, then, here be shortly stated that the word skeleton, in its widest and most scientific sense, should include not only the bones and car- tilages, but also those fibrous structures (or membranes) which surround such bones and cartilages, and thence radiating invest every organ of the body, and finally clothe it externally in the form of skin. The whole skeleton, then, may be denoted by the term Fibro-chondr-osteal3 apparatus. Fibrous tissue indeed penetrates the very bones them- selves, and supports the marrow they contain; it separates each muscle from its neighbour, and surrounds and lines every tube and passage in the body ; so that if every other tissue could be dissolved away and yet this fibrous tissue be left, 1 Derived from aneWu), to dry. 2 Each kind of substance of which the body is composed is termed a tissue. Thus we speak of fibrous tissue and of osseous tissue or bone, also nervous tissue, &c. 3 Because partly fibrous, partly cartilaginous, and partly osseous.

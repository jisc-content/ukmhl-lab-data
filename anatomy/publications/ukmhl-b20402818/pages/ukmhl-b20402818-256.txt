Moreover they grow smaller and more contracted from before backwards, i.e. post-axially. Fig. 191.—Skeleton of the Thorax of a Bird, showing the hypaxial processes, h, descending, which are furnished with complete paraxial arches. (For parts of sternum see Lesson II.) These arches are of the same essential nature as are the hyoidean arch, the mandible, the palatine arch, and the trabe- Fig. 192.—Skull and Branchial Arches of a Shark. b<—b^>, branchial arches ; /i, hyoidean arch ; m, mandible;pg, palato-quadrate arch. {From the College of Surgeons' Museum.) culae cranii, for (as we shall hereafter see) the relations of the nerves and blood-vessels which skirt them are similar. In Fishes, the heart and great blood-vessels are outside the branchial arches, and therefore (as these vessels indicate the line of the pleuro-peritoneal division of the ventral laminae)

VI PREFACE. tary lesson book, and on the other to make its contents too scanty. It would of course be easy indefinitely to add to the details herein stated regarding the structure of the animals referred to. Some readers, no doubt, will expect greater detail; and I can hardly hope, in this first essay, not to have overlooked points it might have been desirable to bring forward. Others may be disposed to think that too large a portion of the book is devoted to the consideration of the skeleton only. This predominance has, however, been deliberately assigned to the osseous structures for the following reasons :â€”i. The general resemblance borne by the skeleton to the external form ; 2. The close connexion between the arrangement of the skeleton and that of the nervous system, muscles, and vessels ; 3. The relations borne by the skeleton of each animal to the actions it performs, i.e. to the mode of life and habits of the various animals ; 4. The obvious utility of the skeleton in classification and the interpretation of affinity ; 5. Parts of the skeleton, or casts of such, are all we possess of a vast number of animals formerly existing in the world, but now entirely extinct ; a good knowledge of the skeleton must therefore be of great utility to those interested in Palaeontology. Moreover, it is a recognized maxim with teachers of (exclu- sively) human anatomy that a thorough knowledge of the bones is not only a necessary preliminary to other anato- mical knowledge, but that the latter is acquired with com- parative ease when the first has been well mastered. I have deemed it advisable to act on this maxim in teaching the anatomy generally of man and of the animals herein referred to.

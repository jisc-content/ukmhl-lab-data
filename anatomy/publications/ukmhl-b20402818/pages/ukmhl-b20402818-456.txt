Thus they may all arise from the aorta in common as one great trunk, subsequently dividing, as in the Ox ; or the left carotid, subclavian, and vertebral arteries may all arise sepa- rately from the aorta, as in the Dugong ; or both common carotids may take origin in one trunk with the right sub- clavian, as in the Lion; or there may be two innominate arteries, each dividing into subclavian and carotid, as in the Hedgehog.

The two common carotids may ascend in close juxta- position, as in Birds, and one of them may be much reduced in size, or even abort. The vertebral artery, instead of passing through the cer- vical transverse processes, may perforate the neural laminae, as in the Llamas. The internal carotid may break up (inside the skull) into a network of small arteries (called a 7'cte mirabile), as e.g. in the Ox.

Its essential nature is revealed by lower forms, where (as e.g. in the Shark Hexanchus) it bifurcates (Fig. 349,^*, hy, and d2), and sends one branch to the posterior margin of the hyoidean arch, and another along the anterior margin of the first branchial arch. This fact may explain its pharyngeal distribution in man. The second, called the ftneumo-gastric, or nervus vagus, is the longest of all the cranial nerves, as it supplies not only the organs of the voice and of respiration, but also the Fig. 350. â€” Infero-lateral View of Head akd Aortic Arches of Lepidosiren. a, oesophagus ; b, anterior end of bulbus aortse ; c, common roots of the first aortic arches ; d, third aortic arch; e, first aortic arch ; f, dorsal union of the first three aortic arches ; g, aorta : h, cceliac artery ; i, exit of the fifth nerve ; k, part of operculum ; /, exit of the nervus vagus from the skull; branches to oesophagus ; n, nerve going to the rectus abdominis ; o, nervus lateralis ; J>, first and hypertrophied rib : q, posterior part of skull; r, segmented neural spines ; s, chorda dorsalis ; i, mandible ; it, quadrate. {After Hyrtl.) heart and the stomach. It sends back two branches to the larynx, which are called " re-current," and the relations of which to the arterial trunks are different on the two sides of the body. The essential nature of this nerve is revealed by the lowest Vertebrates, where (as in Fishes) we find it made up of a great trunk, arising by many rootlets from the

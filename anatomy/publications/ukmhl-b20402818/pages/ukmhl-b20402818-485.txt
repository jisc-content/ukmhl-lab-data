The pancreas of man is a long, soft,-narrow, flattened gland (larger at one end than the other), which lies embraced by a curve of the duodenum. Its excretory duct traverses its length and enters the duodenum a little below the pylorus, Fig. 380.—The Pancreas with its duct (PD), together with the spleen [SJ>L) and the splenic artery (SpA). Below this artery is seen the splenic vein running to help to form the vena porta (VP). Ao, the aorta; D, a pillar of the diaphragm ; PD, the pancreatic duct exposed by dissection in the substance of the pancreas ; Dm, the duodenum ; BD, the biliary duct opening into the pancreatic duct at x ; y, the intestinal vessels. receiving on its road the bile-duct (to be noticed below), so that the two open together into the intestine. The length of the gland is from six to eight inches. 13. The pancreas (or sweetbread) of other Mammals may be more developed and complex than in man, as in Bears, and may have two ducts—as generally in Dogs. It may pre- sent a beautiful arborescent structure, as in the Hedgehog and Flying Fox. It may be in the form of three long lobes meeting together, as in the Pig. The duct may enter the intestine at a much greater dis- tance from the pylorus than in man (as e.g. in the Beaver and Rabbit), and quite distinctly from the bile-duct. In Birds the pancreas appears as a narrow elongated gland lodged in the fold of the duodenum, and generally bent upon itself like the gut it adjoins. It has usually two ducts G G

ELEMENTAR Y ANA TOMY. [less. 3«4 and in all below. In other words, a pons Varolii is a struc- ture peculiar to man's own class. 16. The medulla oblongata of man is normal, but less complex than in much lower forms. Even in some members of man's own order {e.g. the American Apes) certain additional structures (called corpora trapezoidea) separate the upper ends of the pyramids from the pons Varolii. The side walls of the fourth ventricle may be remarkably contorted (as in Rays), forming what is called corpora resti- formia (Fig. 336, 6). The little extension backward, or the rudimentary condition of the cerebellum, sometimes causes the fourth ventricle to come plainly into view, as Ave see in the Frog and the Lam- prey. The fourth ventricle may be relatively enormous, as in Hexanchus. 17. Thus it seems that man exaggerates those characters which distinguish Mammals from lower Vertebrates; i.e. in him the cerebrum and cerebellum are advanced to a maxi- mum of relative size and complexity, while the parts which represent those primitive segments, the fore-brain and mid- brain, show an extreme simplicity and relative inferiority of size. Man's brain is an example of one of three types of structure found in the Vertebrate sub-kingdom. Fig. 338.—Left Side View of Brain of Pigeon (Columba livia.) 1, olfactory lobe ; 2, cerebral hemispheres; 3, pineal gland ; 4, one of the optic lobes (here lateral and depressed) ; 5, cerebellum ; 6, pituitary body ; 8, optic The two other types are (i) the Sauropsidan brain and (2) the Piscine brain. In the first we meet with hollow hemi- spheres, large optic lobes (superior, or lateral and depressed) no lobi inferiores, no enlarged roof to the third ventricle, and no fold of brain-substance extending into a cavity beneath the so-called optic lobes, while often a well-developed cerebellum exhibits the arbor vitse. In the second type we meet with B nerve.

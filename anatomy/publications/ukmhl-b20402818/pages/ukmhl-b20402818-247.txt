v.] SKELETON OF LOWER LIMB. 213 tinct Ichthyosaurus and Plesiosaurus, or the numbers of the phalanges as we proceed from the first to the fifth digit may be 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, as in Lizards, or 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, as in Sala- mandra, or 2, 2, 3, 4, 3, as in the Frog. In Birds (where the fifth digit is never developed) the numbers of the phalanges of the four digits, proceeding from the hallux, are mostly 2, 3, 4, 5; but they may be 2, 3, 3, 3, as in the Swifts, or 2, 3, 4, 3, as in the Goatsuckers. It is by the number of their pha- langes (4 and 5) that the two digits of the Ostrich are known to answer to the fourth and fifth digits of other Sauropsidans {e.g. Lizards) which have all five digits developed.

The terminal phalanges may bifurcate, as in the short-tailed Pangolin, or develop a fold of bone to support the claw, as in Cats and Edentates, e.g. the Sloths.

275 vii.] THE EXTERNAL SKELETON. A similar but less extreme complexity of structure cha- racterizes the .last molar of the largest animal of the Rat order, namely, the so-called River-hog of the La Plata— Hydrochtzrus. Foldings of the dentine, bounded by enamel and with cement filling the valleys and interspaces, produce such com- plex patterns as we find in the Horse and Sheep already described, and also in the Porcupine and Beaver. Molar teeth may grow (like those of man) from roots which soon become calcified, so that no more growth can take place ; and this is the more common condition of the Mammalian molars. They may have very long roots capable of a prolonged but still limited increase, as in the Horse. They may spring from persistent roots growing during the whole of life, as in the Porcupine. The pulp-cavity may be curiously disposed or divided. Thus in poisonous Serpents it extends round the greater part of the poison canal, which, it need hardly be said, is really outside the tooth. It may be divided transversely, as in the incisor of the Horse (Fig. 230), where one branch ascends in front of the depression (or " mark "), and the other branch ascends behind it. It may be divided antero-pos- teriorly, as in notched in- cisors, and especially in the comb-like ones of the Fly- ing Lemur, where (Fig. 228) a branch of the pulp- cavity ascends each pro- cess of the " comb." But the most remark- able form of the pulp- cavity is that which ex- isted in those extinct Ba- trachians the Labyrintho- dons. In those creatures, numerous vertical grooves on the surface penetrate with many inflections deeply into the substance of the teeth, and similar narrow processes of the pulp- cavity interdigitate, also with many inflections, between the inwardly extending grooves. With this structure a transverse Fig. 253.—One Quarter of a much enlarged horizontal section of the Tooth of a Labyrinthodon.

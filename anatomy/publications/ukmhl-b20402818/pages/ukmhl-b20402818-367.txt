It may also be confined to the hand, and therefore be a short muscle, as in the Iguana and Chameleon. It is small in Birds. That symmetrical bifurcation and definite arrangement of the perforated tendons which obtains in man is by no means El Fig. 399.â€”Flexor Muscles and Tendons of Fore-foot of Hyrax.

Thus it is absent in Birds; and in lower Vertebrates (e.g. Iguana) this muscle can hardly be said to be inserted by definite tendons. Even in man's own order we may see by the Nycticebinse how the index digit may fail to have a true perforated tendon, while the imperfect condition of the flexor sublimis may be supplemented (as in Hyrax) by an extra

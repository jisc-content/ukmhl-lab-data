IX.] THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. 389 out division (into upper and lower), so that the primitive folds have, as it were, coalesced, entirely shutting off the conjunctival chamber from the exterior, except by means of the communication effected with the nares through the lachrymal canal. A third eyelid (called the mediating membrane) often exists, as e.g. in Birds, attached to the inner side of the front of the orbit. It is moved in various ways, as already noted in describing the muscles of the eye. A minute rudiment of this structure exists in man. The form of the eyeball may be much less spherical than in man. Thus it may be much flattened anteriorly, as in Fishes ; or, on the contrary, much elongated, i.e. anteriorly produced, as in Birds, e.g. the Owls. The optic nerves may, after development, entirely or all but entirely abort, as in the Mole ; but this atrophy is very exceptional. On the other hand, that primitive condition of the optic nerves in which the fibres do not decussate may persist throughout life, as in the osseous Fishes ; nevertheless, the nerves themselves cross (each one going to the eye of the side of the head opposite to that of its own origin), though they do not form a chiasma. Unlike the nasal organ, the optic structure is never single and median except by mon- strosity. There may even be the appearance of two superim- posed eyes on each side of the head. This remarkable structure occurs in the Fish Anableps, and is produced by the presence of a hori- zontal opaque tract in the middle of the cornea together with a double perforation of the iris. Both eyes may come in the adult to be placed on one side of the head, as in the Flat Fishes, such as the Sole and Turbot; or both eyes may be closely approximated on the upper surface of the head, as in the Fish thence termed the Star-gazer (Uranoscopus).

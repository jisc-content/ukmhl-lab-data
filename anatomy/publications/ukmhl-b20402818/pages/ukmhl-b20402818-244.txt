ELEMENTAR Y ANA TOMY. [less. Fig. 180.—Rudimentary Pelvic Extremity of Ofihiodes. f, fibula ; t, tibia. [After Fiirbringer.) It may be that the metatarsals coalesce with the distal part of the tarsus, as in Birds, the I , , Chameleon, and Bradypus. It /] Metatarsals may coexist each yjj with only one if any phalanx, as vlP in Ophiodes. The first metatar- Y|f sals may widely diverge from the line of the others, as in non- human Primates, and in some Marsupials, e.g. Phalangista. A more complete divergence or opposition, however, may exist, as in most Birds ; or as in the Chameleon, where the two tibial metatarsals are opposed to the three peroneal ones ; or as in Parrots, where the first and fourth are op- posed to the second and third. In the number of these bones and their sub-equality of development man agrees with a great number of Verte- brates above Fishes. Never- theless, the number may be much reduced, and the pro- portions of the several bones may vary in different modes. Thus there may be but a single metatarsal, the third, with rudiments of the second and fourth, as in the Horse ; or but a single large one, the fourth, with the second, third, and fifth metatarsals very small, as in Chceropus. There may be but a single bone, which consists of the third and fourth fused to- gether, as in the Sheep, Deer, &c, and in the Ostrich ; or of second, third, and fourth fused together, as in the Jerboa and the Emeu ; or of these and the first also, as in many Birds Fig. 181.—Bones of Right Foot of Chceropus castanotis (nat. size). «, astragalus ; c, calcaneum ; cb, cu - boides ; c 3, ecto-cuneiforme ; n, na- viculare ; //. ///.

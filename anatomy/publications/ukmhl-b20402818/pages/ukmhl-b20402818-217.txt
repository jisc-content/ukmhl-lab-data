The knee-pan, or patella, is a small bone somewhat tri- angular, yet rounded in outline, con- vex in front and with two articular surfaces (to fit to the condyles of the femur) behind. It is attached above by its broad upper margin to the tendon of the front muscle of the thigh. Below, a ligament goes from its pointed lower end to the upper part of the shin-bone. 4. The TIBIA, or shin-bone, is, like the femur, an elongated bone, more so than any other in the human body except the femur. It transmits the whole weight of the body to the foot. Its upper end is very wide, and presents two concave articular sur- faces {condyles)—which receive the two condyles of the femur—and be- tween them an eminence (the spine), behind which is a pit giving insertion to one end of one of the crucial ligaments which connect the femur with the tibia. These ligaments pass, one from the pit just mentioned 'to the outer side of the inner condyle of the femur, while the other goes from the front of the spine of the tibia to the inner side of the outer condyle of the femur. Two inter-articular carti- lages, called semilunar, are also interposed between the cartilaginous articular surfaces of the femur and those of the tibia. Two other ligaments may be noted. One, the internal lateral ligameiit, goes from the internal tuberosity of the femur to the inner surface of the tibia ; and the other, the external lateral ligament, goes from the outer tuberosity of the femur to the fibula. The shaft of the tibia is triangular in section, being pro- Fig. 156.—Front View of Right Tibia and Fibula of Man. c, crest of the tibia ; em ternal malleolus ; e tn_ ternal tuberosity \f, fibula h, head of the fibula ; im internal malleolus; itu, in- ternal tuberosity ; s, spine of the tibia ; t, tubercle.

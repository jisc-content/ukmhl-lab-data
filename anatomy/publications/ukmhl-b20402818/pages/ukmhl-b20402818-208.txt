[less. ELEMENTAR V ANA TOMY. The first may disappear or be rudimentary, as happens in very many forms ; or the second digit alone may be very reduced, as in the Potto. The first may be short and the four others exceedingly elongated and slender, as in the Bats ; or the first three may be short and the fourth enormous, as in the Pterodactyles. The whole five metacarpals may be extremely short and stunted, as in the Mole, and still more so in the Land Tor- toises and in the Ichthyosaurus. The arumber five is never increased (except by monstrosity) in any known Vertebrate. 21. The number of DIGITS which may be developed has been indicated in treating of the metacarpus. Thus there may be but a single digit, as in the Horse; two, as in Ruminants, and in Chceropus. There may be three, as in the Rhinoceros, Proteus, and Seps (second, third, and fourth, or first, second, and third); or, as is very often the case {e.g. Pig, Dog, &c), there may be four. The digits are never certainly more than five (except by monstrosity), al- though in the Ichthyosaurus extra mar- ginal bones give the appearance of more. The filamentary bones which terminate or fringe the fins of Fishes are not digits at all, but are dermal ossifications called " fin rays," which will be spoken of with the rest of the external skeleton. When a digit is wanting, it is generally the pollex, as in Spider Monkeys, but it may be the fifth, as in Pterodactyles, or the fourth and fifth, as in Birds. The thumb (pollex) may be more or less opposable, as in most Monkeys and Lemurs ; or two digits may be opposed to three, as in the Chameleon. The second digit may be greatly reduced, as in the Potto ; or the third may be disproportionately slender, as in the Aye- Fig. 148—Hand of Bat [Pteropus). tit1—m 4, metacarpals of the four fingers ; pollex, with a very short metacarpal, sc, scaphoides.

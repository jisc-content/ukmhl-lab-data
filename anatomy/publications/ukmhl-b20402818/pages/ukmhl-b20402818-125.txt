91 THE CRANIAL SKELETON. III.] When the skull is divided vertically and in the direction of the sagittal suture, we may note the vast size of the brain cavity in proportion to the face ; also the horizontal con- dition of the cribriform plate and foramen magnum, and the advanced position of the latter approaching the middle line from behind forwards. The basilar parts of the occipital and sphenoid bones are seen to become rapidly thicker as we go forwards ; they form Fig. 91. —Vertical, Longitudinal Section of Man's Skull. a, greater wing of the sphenoid ; au, meatus auditorius internus ; bo, body of the occipital bone ; 6s, body of the sphenoid ; c, condyle ; c , crista galli; cy, con- dyloid foramen ; f, frontal; me, median ethmoid ; mx, palatine plate of the maxillary ; n, nasal; o, squama of the occipital bone ; p, parietal ; //, palatine bone; pt, internal pterygoid process ; s, frontal sinus; sq, squamous part of temporal bone (beneath it is the petrous part of that bone, with the opening au); t, lowest turbinal bone ; v, vomer. The straight line passing upwards and forwards from the hinder end of the body of the occipital bone, represents the 6asi-cranial axis. The line passing downwards to the front of the jaw, represents the 6asi-facial axis. the true axis of the skull, and a line drawn from the anterior margin of the foramen magnum to the front end of the middle part of the upper (or cerebral) surface of the sphenoid :s called the basi-cranial axis. A line drawn from the same \»oint of the sphenoid plate to the front part of the alveolar margin of the maxilla is the basi-facial axis, and the two \xes in man form an angle which varies from 900 to 1200. The basi-cranial axis forms with the foramen magnum a

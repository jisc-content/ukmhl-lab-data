XL] 443 THE ALIMENTARY SYSTEM. Nothing like a crop exists in man's class, with the single exception of the common Dormouse, which has the lower end of the oesophagus enlarged into a glandular dilatation. . The oesophagus may be much more muscular than in man; or it may be rather valvular at its lower end, as in the Dugong, and still more so as in the Porpoise. The stomach is sometimes indistinguishable from the oesophagus, with which it is directly continuous, without any marked constriction, as in most Fishes. It may form one continuous canal with the oesophagus, even in Birds, e.g. the Cormorant; and indeed in Birds (Fig. 378, pr), generally the first or cardiac part of the stomach (called the proventriculus) seems to resemble more a dilatation of the lower end of the oesophagus—like that of the Dormouse—than a stomach proper. It may attain to a very much greater complexity than it attains in man, as we see by the Sheep. The various exaggerated forms which the stomach assumes may be arranged under two heads : (1) an elongation, (2) a differentiation, with distinct correlated chambers. The first condition may exist even in man's own order, as in the long-tailed Monkeys of India, the Semnopilheci, which have the pyloric part of the stomach exceedingly elongated and also sacculated, i.e. puckered up into a succes- sive series of bags. This condition is carried still further in the Kangaroo, where the cardiac end is also exceedingly prolonged. The second form of stomach is slightly exemplified in the Pig, where the cardiac fundus is dilated into a little pouch, Fig. 375. —Stomach of a Sheep, cut open to show the various lining of the different parts. ce, oesophagus ; r, rumen or paunch ; rt, reticulum or honeycomb ; fis, psalterium or manyplies ; a, abomasum or rennet ; d, duodenum. while two parallel folds lead from the oesophagus to the pylorus.

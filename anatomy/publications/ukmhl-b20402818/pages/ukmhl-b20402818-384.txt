ELEMENTARY ANA TO MY. 34^ [less. combines with the tensor vaginae femoris and the gluteus maximus to form an almost continuous muscular sheet,extend- ing as to its origin from the crest of the ilium to the caudal vertebrae and ischium, and, as to its insertion, from the patella to the ankle, thus contributing to form a most powerful flexor of the limb. This muscle may be entirely wanting, as in the Bats (ac- cording to Meckel). We may, on the contrary, find a com- plexity of muscular structure on the peroneal aspect of the pelvic limb, by far exceeding anything met with in the class to which man belongs. Fig. 313.â€”Deeper Muscles of Extensor Surface of Right Leg of B, biceps; EB, extensor brevis; EH, extensor hallucis ; ELD, extensor longus digitorum ; EC, femoro-caudal ; GMd and GMi, muscles like the lesser glutei; GMx and EE, great extensors of the thigh ; /, muscle resembling the iliacus ; IIC, ilio-caudal; IP, ilio-peroneal; SM and ^7", muscles like the semi- membranosus and semi-tendinosus respectively ; TA, tibialis amicus. Thus in some Reptiles and Batrachians we find four dis- tinct muscles which, if not exactly answering to the biceps, may most fitly be noticed in relation with it. Thus (1) we have a muscle (sometimes called ilio-peroneal) extending from the outer side of the ilium downwards to be inserted by a strong tendon outside the upper part of the MeNOI'OI

333 THE MUSCLES. VIII.] the Hedgehog, and Pig), or there may be but one, as in Pteropus. The thumb, on the contrary, may have its own lumbricalis, as in Dasypus Sexcmctus; and there may be eight in the hand, as in Galeopithecus. The pronator quadratics may be much more elongated than in man, as in the Uog and Cat. It may, however, be completely wanting, as in the Flying Fox and in the Horse. An accessory pronator may be developed (as in the Iguana and Chameleon), arising from the internal condyle and radial border of the ulna, and being inserted into the lower part of the radius between the insertions of the pronator teres and pronator quadratus.

B, biceps ; FCR, flexor carpi radialis; FCU, flexor carpi ulnaris ; FPD, flexor profundus digitorum ; PA, pronator accessorius ; PQ, pronator quadratus; PT, pronator teres ; SA, supinator accessorius; SL, supinator longus. Supinator longus. This is a very inconstant muscle, as might be expected from its action, which is related to the exceptional mobility of the fore-arm and hand of man. Thus it is totally absent in many animals, e.g. the Horse. It may, on the contrary, attain a vastly greater relative size than in man, as in Bradypus, where it takes origin from the lower three quarters of the humerus, and is separable into two parts; it is large and double in some Reptiles, e.g. the Iguana and Chameleon (Figs. 302 and 303). The extensor carpi radialis longior is exceptionally distinct in man, for in most Mammals it is more or altogether united with the extensor carpi ?-adialis brevior.

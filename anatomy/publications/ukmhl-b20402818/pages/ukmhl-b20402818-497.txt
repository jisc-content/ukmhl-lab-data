THE EXCRETORY ORGANS, XII.] LESSON XII. THE EXCRETORY ORGANS. I. In the First Lesson of "Elementary Physiology/' ยง 23, while explaining the nature of the excretory process and its most general conditions, it was stated that the excretory ORGANS are three in number, namely : (1), the skin; (2), the lungs ; and,(3), the kidneys. The description of the skin and its various appendages has formed the subject of our Seventh Lesson. Nevertheless, the consideration of its glandular structure was purposely deferred to the Twrelfth Lesson, and may be here considered, with the lungs and kidneys together with adjoined and adjacent structures not yet treated of. The lungs, however, are importers of oxygen (for the aeration of the blood) as well as excretory organs ; it is not, then, surprising that the external skin may assume that func- tion also, as in fact we found (when considering the circulating system) to be the case in Batrachians. The function of importing oxygen into the blood is per- formed in many animals by a set of organs of which no repre- sentative exists in man, and which, therefore, are not referred to in the Lessons of " Elementary Physiology," though they must occupy no inconsiderable portion of our concluding Lesson of " Elementary Anatomy." The organs in question (mentioned in our First and Tenth Lessons) are the gills, or branchicE. These are delicate processes of skin, richly supplied with blood and capable of absorbing oxygen, not by the decomposition of the water in which they float, but by the absorption of oxygen from the particles of air which are mixed up with and dissolved in that water. Such structures, as might be expected, are only found in animals which live in or frequent water, whether fresh or salt, though not all animals which frequent water have gills. Thus, in being destitute of branchiae, man agrees not only with the whole of his class (including, of course, the Whales

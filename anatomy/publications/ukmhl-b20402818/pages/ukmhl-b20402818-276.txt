A familiar and very valuable modification of the epidermic skeleton is known to us under the name of " tortoise-shell,'' Fig. 204.—Ventral Surface of the Plastron of a Fresh-water Tortoise {Emys). The bony scutes are nine in number, ic, inter-clavicular scute ; c, clavicular scute ; hy, hyo-sternal scute ; hp, hypo-sternal scute ; xp, xiphi-sternal scute. The horny epidermal scales are twelve in number, as indicated by the dark lines ; one such traverses each xiphi-sternal and hypo-sternal near its middle. which coats externally the rigid and solid bony armour of a certain kind of Turtle. An essentially similar though com- mercially valueless structure also invests the armour of almost all kinds of Tortoises and Turtles, and consists of plates disposed in regular series upon the back and on the belly. 8. The true dermis often becomes ossified, constituting an exo-skeleton of the most unequivocal kind. An example of such a condition is to be found even in man's own class, Mammalia, namely, in the Arma- dillos. These creatures possess a very complete armour, formed of small, Fig 205.—Armadillo. many-sided, bony plates (termed scutes), with their margins adjusted together, aggregated in masses differently in different kinds. There is generally one mass, or shield, on the head, one on the shoulders, one on the loins, with narrow b^ds of

SKELETON OF LOWER LLML v.] and in some Mammals, e.g. the Cats. It may, however, be very wide, as in the Sloths and Wombat and Cape Ant- eater. This bone in man is peculiarly shaped in relation to his erect posture. Thus, comparing man's tibia with the same bone in other members of his own order (Primates), we find that it is longer as compared with the spine than in any other genus except Hylobates and Tarsius, and longer as compared with the radius than in any except Hapale and Tarsius. On the contrary, its length as compared with the femur is less than in any other Primate. The tubercle of the tibia is probably at its maximum of distinctness in man as compared with the rest of his class, and the articular surfaces for the condyles of the femur occupy a maximum proportion of the upper surface of the tibia. The sharpness of its crest in man exceeds that of any other Primate, and the descent of the posterior border of the articular surface for the I astragalus below the anterior margin of that surface is peculiar to him. \ The tibia may be very much curved, e.g. in the Ornithorhynchus, yet it may be straight and exces- sively long, as in many Birds. The crest may project very promi- nently and sharply at the upper end of the bone, as e.g. in Ruminants, the Kangaroo, and Hare. The tubercle of the tibia may be enormously produced upwards into a long pointed process, as in certain Birds, e.g. the Grebe and Divers. In some forms nearly allied to man, as the Orang, the articular surface of the malleolus forms an obtuse angle with the inferior surface of the tibia. The tibialis posticus groove may be much deeper than in man, the portion of bone separating it from that for the flexor longus pollicis pedis having thus the appearance of a promi- nent process. Such is the case in Nycticebus. tic 172.—Leg-bones of the Diver (Colymbus). b, fibula •;/, femur ; t, tibia, with p, its enormously pro- duced tubercle.

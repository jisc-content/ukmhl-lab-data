THE MUSCLES. VIII.] Mammals, e.g. Talpa and Spalax; and in Lepidosiren, the Lamprey, and Lancelet amongst Fishes. On the contrary, muscles may be developed which do not exist in man at all. Thus in most Mammals {e.g. the Horse) a conical funnel- shaped muscular mass may spring from around the optic foramen, and, passing within the recti, attach itself to the sclerotic. Fig. 283.â€”Deeper Muscles of Right Side of Menopoma (the mylo-hyoids and trapezius being removed or cut short). A A, adductor arcuum ; CA, constrictor arcuum; CF, constrictor faucium ; CHE, cerato-hyoideus externus ; CHI, cerato-hyoideus interus ; D, deltoid ; D1 and D z, digastric; ExO, external oblique ; GH, genio-hyoideus; InO, internal oblique ; LAS, levator anguli scapulae ; LD, latissimus dorsi; M, masseter ; S, subclavius ; SM, serratus magnus ; T, trapezius. This mass may divide itself into two portions, as in the Rhinoceros ; three, as in the Frog; or into four, as in the Porpoise. In the last case we have thus four supplementary recti muscles within the four normal ones. It may be that the superior oblique muscle does not pass through a pulley. It does not do so in Vertebrates below Mammals, where it arises at the front part, not the back of the orbit. The two oblique muscles may thus arise, one above the other, from the inner angle of the orbit, as in the Frog and in Fishes. The muscles of the eye may take origin in part from the basis cranii and in part from the fronto-parietal, as in the Frog ; or they may spring from within a bony canal situated beneath the basis cranii, as in many bony Fishes, e.g. the Carp.

45 II.] THE SPINAL SKELETON. class. It is possible, however, for the neural spine to send back a pair of processes (hyperapophyses *), as in Galago, &c, embracing the neural spine next below, or, as in Dolphins, that a pair of metapophyses may project pre- axically from one spine and embrace that of the next vertebra. These, however, do not support articular processes, and are rather checks than joints. But a much more complex mode of arti- culation is possible. Thus, in Serpents and Iguanas.we may have a median prominence with two articular surfaces, developed from the pre-axial surface of the neural arch, and fitting into a corresponding concavity on the post-axial surface of the vertebra in front. This pre-axial wedge-shaped process is called the zygosphene? and the correspond- ing post-axial excavation is termed the zygantrum.3 The maximum of dorsal joint complica- tion, however, is found in the last dorsal vertebra of certain Edentates, e.g. the Great Ant-eater. Here each postzygapophysis develops two additional articular surfaces, one on each side of a notch, which receives a process from the pre-axial side of the h (l neural arch, which process is furnished with two corresponding surfaces — there thus being three articular surfaces on each side of such vertebra, fitting into corresponding surfaces of the vertebra adjacent in the mode known in carpentry as " tenon and mortice." In so far as man's dorsal vertebras are all free {i.e. true vertebrae), he agrees with other Vertebrates, except such abnormal forms as Chelonians and the Glyptodon, and except also Birds, in which anchylosis unites a greater or less number of the vertebrae next the lumbar region. 1 From vnep, beyond, over, and apophysis. 2 From £vy6v, a yoke, and crtyn*, a wedge. 3 From fuyo v, and avrpov, a cavity.

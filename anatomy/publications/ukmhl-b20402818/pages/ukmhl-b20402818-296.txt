[less. such notches are more marked, but these attain their maxi- mum of development in the lower jaw of the Flying Lemur {Galeopithecus)i where each incisor has the appearance of a comb, being notched by parallel notches down to the very base of the crown. (Fig. 228). Rarely, as in certain Insectivorous Beasts (e.g. Hemi- cmtetes), the upper incisor may bear more than one cusp. Fig. 229.—Side View of Skull of Hemicentetes. An excavated incisor of a different kind is familiar to us in the Horse, where each incisor has a deep median depres- sion, the " mark," which has a form such as would be pro- duced by the sudden inflection of the surface of the tooth so as to form a deep pit. This " mark " continues to be visible till the tooth has worn down by use beyond the point to which the inflection extends. The dark colour of the " mark" is due merely to the accumulation ot fragments of food and foreign bodies within the pit. When the canine teeth are large the incisors are generally small, as we see in the Dog and Cat, where Fig. 230.—Vertical Sec- there are three above and three cisoR,°showing°thi^'depth below on each side of each jaw. of the vertical fold forming This is the typical number of Mam- the "mark" m. malian incisors, but they may be as p, the pulp cavity. many as I on each side, as in the {After Rousseau.) American Opossums. Incisors may, on the contrary, be altogether wanting though other teeth are present, as in the Armadillos, except one kind. They may be quite want- ing in the upper jaw but present in the lower, even in man's own order, e.g. Lepiletnur.

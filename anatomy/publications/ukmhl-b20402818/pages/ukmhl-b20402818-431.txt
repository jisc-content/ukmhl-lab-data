395 IX.] THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. In osseous Fishes a yet further segmentation occurs, as we find in addition a third bone, called the meta-fiterygoid. Fig. 346.â€”The Membrane of the Drum of the Ear, seen from the inner side, with the small hones of the ear ; and the walls of the tympanum, with the air-cells in the mastoid part of the temporal bone. MC, mastoid cells; Mall, malleus ; Inc, incus ; St, stapes; a b, lines drawn through the horizontal axis on which the malleus and incus turn. The incus becomes relatively smaller as we descend to the Sauropsida, and the stapes appears as a little straight ossicle (the columella auris) coming to the incus from the fenestra ovalis as usual. In Fishes, however, where there is no fenestra, there is no such ossicle, and the representative of the incus (i.e. the highest part of the hyoidean visceral arch) is a very large bone termed the hyo-mandibiilar. Thus, if this interpretation be correct, it is plain that our comprehension of man's auditory ossicles would be very im- perfect if studied only in man himself. The three little auditory bones, the malleus, the incus, and the stapes, instead of being all similar in nature as in function, are singularly different. The malleus is, as it were, the upper part of the lower jaw, separated, reduced in size, and taken into the ear through the Glasserian fissure, and applied to the assistance of a special sense. The incus is the extreme summit of the anterior cornu of the os hyoides, separated and also applied to a similar purpose. The stapes is quite different in nature, being a small por- tion of the cranial wall which has grown out, become

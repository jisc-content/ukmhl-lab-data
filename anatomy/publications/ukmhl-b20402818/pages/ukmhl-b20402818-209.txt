iv.] SKELETON OF UPPER LIMB. 175 Aye ; or thick, as in the Great Armadillo. The digits may be enormously long, as in the Bats ; or short, as in the Land Tortoises. They may be very imperfectly developed, as in Birds. They may be so united by dense tissue as to be quite incapable of separate motion, as in the Cetaceans.

In distinctness they also agree with most, but it is possible for the proximal row of phalanges to become anchylosed to the metacarpals, as is the case in the Three- toed Sloth. The phalanges, instead of decreasing in length, distad,1 as in man, may so increase—as in the three ulnar digits of Dasypus villosns. A terminal phalanx of a digit may far exceed in length its two proximal phalanges, as is the case in the middle finger of Priodontes, and in the three middle digits of Perameles. The number of phalanges may be much greater than in man, e.g. as many as fourteen, in the third digit of Glo- biocephalus. Often in Reptiles the number of phalanges increases from two in the pollex to five in the fourth digit, as in the Monitor. The abortive hand of Birds at its best has but 1 As we proceed from above downwards to the fingers' ends.

[less. and Porpoises), but with the Sauropsida also ; while in pos- sessing lungs he agrees with all Vertebrates, except Fishes, which with the exception of the Mud-fish {Leftido siren) are destitute of true lungs. First, then, may be considered the lungs as they exist in man and Vertebrates generally. After that will naturally follow the consideration of gills, or branchiae, parts which in function answer to the lungs of man, though they have no resemblance in structure or mode of development.

RV, right ventricle; L V, left ventricle; RA, right auricle; LA, left auricle; Ao, aorta; PA, pulmonary artery; PV, pulmonary veins; PL, right lung; LL, left lung ; VS, vena cava superior ; SC, subclavian vessels ; C, carotids; A' and LJV,right and left jugularveins ; VI, vena cava inferior ; T, trachea : B, bronchi. All the great vessels but those of the lungs are cut. 2. The lungs of man have been shortly described in the Fourth Lesson of " Elementary Physiology." They are two in number, one placed on each side of the heart, and (with it and the blood-vessels, air-passages, and oesophagus) fill up the entire cavity of the thorax. The lungs are attached, by their roots, to the two branches of the windpipe (hereafter to be described), and to the great vessels proceed- ing to and fro between the lungs and the heart. From this attachment each lung hangs down freely sus- pended in a short serous sac—the pleura—which closely invests it. This is the proper serous sac of the thorax.

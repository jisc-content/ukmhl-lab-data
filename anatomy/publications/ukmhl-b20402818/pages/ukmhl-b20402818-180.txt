The superior and shortest border of the scapula exhibits a deep notch, which is converted into a foramen by means of a ligament. In front of this notch rises a strongly pro- jecting curved process, called from its beak-like shape the coracoid?

The hinder border is the longest. It is called the vertebral border, because it is nearest to the backbone. The third border (called the axillary border) ascends obliquely from the lower end of the vertebral border to a rounded, concave, shallow, articular surface, called the glenoid3 cavity (into which the head of the upper-arm bone is received), and which is overhung within and in front by the coracoid process on its internal side, while the acromion overhangs it externally and behind. The part which sup- ports the glenoid surface is termed the neck. The superior and vertebral borders meet in a sharp superior angle, while at the junction of the axillary and vertebral borders is a flattened space for the insertion of a muscle called the teres major. The coracoid and acromion arise from distinct centres of 1 From aKpoc, a summit, and u<hoq, the 2 From xo^af, a crow, and.eidog, form. 3 From 7A>'/t/>j, a superficial cavity. the shoulder.

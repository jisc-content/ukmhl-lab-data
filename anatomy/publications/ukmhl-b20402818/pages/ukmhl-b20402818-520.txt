The THYROID GLAND of man is a soft, reddish, and very vascular body, embracing the trachea in front, and ascending to the larynx. It has no duct, and is of a more or less semilunar form, with two lateral lobes, united by an isthmus. It is covered by the sterno-hyoid, sterno-thyroid. and omo-hyoid muscles. In that man develops a thyroid gland he appears to agree with all Vertebrates except the Lancelet. This body may consist of two completely divided lateral halves, placed each on one side of the trachea and larynx, as in Birds, Batrachians, Monitors, the Llama, the Otter, the Mole, and others, and as even in the Orang. It may consist of one undivided body, as in Cetaceans. It may be represented fas in Birds) by small rounded or elongated bodies, very vascular, placed beside the trachea, above the syrinx, and closely connected with the carotid or

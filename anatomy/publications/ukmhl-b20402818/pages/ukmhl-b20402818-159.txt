Hi.] THE CRANIAL SKELETON. 125 Fishes. These branchial arches extend on each side of the throat upwards towards the spine^ and support the gills on their inner sides. Other cartilaginous arches which were spoken of in the Second Lesson as existing in the Lamprey and some Sharks, may support the outer sides of the gills. The branchial arches become successively smaller posteriorly, or as we recede from the head. Thus we see what numerous large and important parts of the lowest Vertebrates are rudi- mentarily represented by the human hyoidean cornua.

Uppermost left-hand figure, the youngest condition ; lowest right-hand figure, the adult. h, the hyoidean arch, ultimately the corniculum ; b'—b4, the four branchial arches which become gradually atrophied, the cornua (or thyro-hyal), thbeing their representative in the adult; b', another branchial rudiment ; bh, the body of the hyoid. The cornicula represent only the so-called hyoidean arch —namely, that arch in Fishes which comes behind the lower jaw and in front of the branchial arches. We have seen that in man's own class this arch may con- sist of several distinct bones, that is to say, of a tympano- hyal, a stylo-hyal, an epi-hyal, and a cerato-hyal, though in man himself the epi-hyal is only represented by ligament. It is, therefore, less surprising that in the lowest vertebrate class this arch should be large and complex with bony

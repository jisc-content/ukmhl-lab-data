A fundamentally different structure may obtain, as in Fishes, where we have, as a rule, no malar; and where the more con- spicuous representative of the temporal bone (exclusive of the representatives of the petrous portion) is the pre-operculum, —which may perhaps be said to replace a zygoma, extending down as it does to the quadrate bone which suspends the lower jaw. The connexion of the quadrate bone, however, with the maxillary bone is only effected by means of soft structures, which must alone, therefore, represent the inferior zygoma of the Sauropsida. The bones which connect the quadrate with the upper jaw have relation not to the zygoma, but to the palate.

Returning to man's own class, we find that the lateral region is generally much more open than in him. The spheno-maxil- lary fissure, for example, is defined by the projection outwards of the alisphenoid. Generally this projection is wanting; therefore the orbit opens widely into the temporal fossa. This fissure may, however, be more closed up than it is even in man, as we see in certain Apes, and notably in the Howling Monkeys. The pterygo-maxillary fissure may also become as it were more or less opened out, and the spheno-maxillary fossa

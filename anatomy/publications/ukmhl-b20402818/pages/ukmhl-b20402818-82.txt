ELEMENTAR Y ANA TO MY. 5° [less. The canal formed by the series of perforated transverse processes may be replaced by one excavated inside the neural arches, as in the cervical vertebrae of the Camels and Llamas. In some Cetaceans the external osseous boundary of the perforated transverse process is wanting, so that there come to be two elongated transverse processes on each side. The length of the cervical neural spines in man, though much greater than in many animals, is yet quite insignificant compared with the development they attain in certain Apes (Gorilla, Orang, Perodicticus) and in the true Opossums. Indeed, these animals show that the cervical spines may be the longest ones of the whole vertebral column. In the true Opossums and in some Armadillos their apices become anchylosed together. The bifurcation of the neural spines is carried further down the backbone {i.e. extends to more vertebrae) in man than in any other mammal ; but this is not the maximum of complication of the part, as in the Howling Monkeys (Mycetes) we find a trifid spine. On the other hand, we often meet with a bifurcation in the dorsal and lumbar regions which is not present in the human skeleton. That faintly-marked prominence which exists in man in front of the prezygapophysis is really a rudiment of a meta- pophysis, as is plainly shown by the skeleton of the Spider Monkey (Ateles).

The smoothness of the anterior surface of the cervical vertebral bodies in man is a great contrast to their condition in some animals (as e.g. in Birds); for prominences (the hypa- pophyses) on the post-cephalic vertebrae may (as in Crotalus)

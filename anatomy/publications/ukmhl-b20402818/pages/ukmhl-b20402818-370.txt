ELEMENTARY ANATOMY. [less. 334 Anconeus. This muscle, which in man seems to be but a small part of the triceps, may be a very large and very dis- tinct muscle, as in Dasypus and Phoca. Extensor communis digitorum. This is exceptionally dis- tinct in man, being often (as e.g. already in Nycticebus) blended with one or more other extensors. It may be so diminished and short as to extend only from the carpus to the digits, as e.g. in Iguana and Chameleo, Fig. 302.â€”Radial Side of Right Arm of Parson's Chameleon. A^, adductor digiti tertii; A4, adductor digiti quarti; B, biceps ; B r, B2, B3, ex- tensores phalangorum ; E3, EA, E$, extensores metacarporum ; ERL, ex- tensor radialis longior ; FR, flexor radialis ; MP, extensor metacarpi pollicis ; PT, pronator teres ; SL, supinator longus. Extensor minimi digiti. This extensor, which may be absent, may also be present where we might hardly expect to find it. Thus it may be present in forms in which the digitus minimus is entirely absent, e.g. the Horse. This fact is less remarkable, however, when it is recollected that the

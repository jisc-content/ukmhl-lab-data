250 ELEMENTARY ANATOMY. [less. Dentine forms the bulk of the tooth ; the dense enamel coats the crown ; the cement invests the fang. The dentine is traversed by exceedingly minute tubes which radiate into it from the pulp cavity. The enamel is the hardest structure in the human body, and almost en- tirely a mineral, containing but two per cent, of animal substance. It is made up of minute fibres, with their ends applied to the surface of the dentine of the tooth. The ce- ment is more like bone ; it may take a much greater share in the formation of the tooth than is assigned to it in the teeth of man. Magnified about three diameters. 17. As all know, teeth are cut. The meaning of this is that, as the tooth develops, it rises out of its sac, the parts superficial to its apex being absorbed. As its crown rises its fang is developed. The teeth appear successively in two sets. First the milk- teeth come into place, and afterwards the second or permanent set of teeth. Each permanent tooth is formed in a little sac, which at first is but a prolongation of the sac of that milk-tooth which it is destined to succeed. The development of the second tooth is accompanied by

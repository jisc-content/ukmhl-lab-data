Thus in Fishes it is wanting in a few species, as e.g. in the Lamprey and Pristis. In Birds it is wanting in most Parrots and Cuckoos, as well is in the Pigeons. Amongst Mammals it is absent in the Cetacea, the Sloths, the Elephant, the Camel, the Hyrax, Horse, Tapir, and Rhinoceros.

The gall-bladder may be placed exceptionally on the left side, as in the Thylacine. It may be, as it were, inverted, perforating part of the liver and appearing on the upper surface, as in Lemuroids, e.g. Galago. Where a gall-bladder is wanting, the bile-duct may—as in the Elephant—be dilated at its entrance into the duodenum. The colour of the liver may differ strikingly from that which we find in man. This is especially the case in Fishes, where it may be bright red, as in Holocentrum Orientalej or yellow, as in Atheriiia presbyter j or green, as in the Lamprey. The liver may also be much less dense in consistency than in man—as in Fishes generally ; and in aquatic Mammals, such as the Cetacea, Seals, and Otter, it is said to be softer than in other kinds of the same class.

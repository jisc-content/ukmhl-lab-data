IV.] SKELETON OF UPPER LIMB. 107 cannot be quite assumed by the adult human being, though it is the permanent condition of some Reptiles, especially the Chelonians. The head of the radius is often much larger relatively than in man, as e.g. in the Dog and Ruminants.

As with the radius, so with the ULNA, we can only employ Vertebrates above Fishes for comparison. In the proportion it bears to the radius, man's ulna agrees on the whole with the relation obtaining in the majority of forms. It may, however, be larger and more important than the radius, as is the case in Birds, e.g. the Eagle. On the con- trary, it may be very much smaller and more or less abortive, as in Ruminants and Bats. That the proportionate size of this bone has no relation to flight is shown by the just- mentioned fact, that it is the larger bone in Birds and the smaller one in Bats.

In fact, however, the clavicle of man is made up of four parts, as has been noted. Thus we have— (1) The body of the bone. (2) The acromial end of the clavicle, remaining cartilagi- nous in the young state, called the meso-scapular segment. (3) The sternal epiphysis of the clavicle, called the pre- coracoid. (4) The inter-articular fibro-cartilage interposed between the clavicle and the sternum, called the omosternum. Fig 135.—Inner part of Clavicle and part of sternum of a shrew —Sorex. (After Parker.) cl, sternal part of clavicle ; ec, epi- coracoid ; fic, pre-coracoid ; ost, omo- sternum. Fig. 136.— Right Scapula and Scapular part of Clavicle of a Shrew—Sorex. (After Parker.) a, acromion ; c, coracoid ; cl, clavicle ; ma, metacromion ; mss, meso-sca- pular segment. Now, inasmuch as the clavicle of man consists of only one conspicuous element, is separated from its fellow clavicle by the sternum, and connected externally with the acromion, it has the general characters of the bone in his class. It may, however, be entirely absent, as in all Cetacea and Ungulata, in many Carnivora and Rodents. It may, on the contrary, be very short and rudimentary, and suspended by long ligaments both to the scapula and sternum, as in the Guinea-pig and Rabbit. It may be separate from its fellow of the opposite side and from the sternum, as in the Cassowary and Emeu. It may—though this is very rare—have ultimately coalesced with the coracoid, so as to form a complex single bone of double nature, as in the so-called clavicle of the Mole, which helps to form the articulation of the humerus.

ill.] THE CRANIAL SKELETON. 107 here that it is only found very elongated and anchylosed to the skull in man, though an anchylosed but less elongated one is sometimes found in a species of Baboon. Fig. 103.â€”Under Surface of the Skull of the Lemur Microcelus minor, showing the inflated auditory bullae (on each side in front of the foramen magnum), and also the defects of ossification in the bony palate. The tympano-hyal will also be noticed with the hyoidean structures. Only in Mammals, but in them constantly, does it form a process of the skull. Its common form, as in the Dog, is that of a small cylindrical truncated process, between the tympanic bulla and the paroccipital process. In man it is obscured by anchylosis with the styloid process, of which it forms the root. 23. The sphenoid, like the temporal bone of man, is a highly complex one, as is made evident by what we find in other animals. The body of the sphenoid is a less constant structure as a distinct bone than might be supposed. On the other hand, that close union between it and the basi-occipital, which in adult man is constant, is rarely found elsewhere. Even the body of the sphenoid itself, in Mammals, is generally formed of two

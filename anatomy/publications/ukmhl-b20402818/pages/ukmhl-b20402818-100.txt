[less. 66 The middle part of the sternum {me so sternum) may be much shorter relatively than in man, as is the case in the Sperm Whale, and it may abort, as just said, in the Dugong. Generally, however, in Mammals it is large and more per- manently segmented than in him, and may (as in the Orang) show to a much later period its median division. The divi- sion into two lateral halves (one piece on each side only) transitorily exists in the Struthious Birds.

The segments of the mesosternum may send down pro- cesses together forming a sort of keel, and each furnished with two articular surfaces for the ribs, as is the case in the Tamandua Ant-eater. The xiphoid cartilage, or its osseous or cartilaginous repre- sentative, may abort altogether as a distinct part, as in the Tailed-Batrachians and the Right Whale. It may be long and pointed, as in the Two-toed Ant-eater, or enlarged and rounded, as in very many species (e.g. Sorex). It may even in Mammals be enormously produced into two elongated horns, far exceed- ing all the rest of the sternum in size, as in the long-tailed Pan- golin ; and a similar but more reduced form may exist in Lizards (e.g. Iguana, Draco (Fig. 78), and still more Stellid). It is in Birds, however, that the xiphisternum attains its maximum of size and importance, forming all that part of the sternum post-axial to the attachment of the ribs. It may consist of one sheet (as in the Qstrich and Cassowary), or be

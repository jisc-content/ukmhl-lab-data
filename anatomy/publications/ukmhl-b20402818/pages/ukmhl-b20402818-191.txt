SKELETON OF UPPER LIMB, nr.] 157 may, however, be very much elongated, as in the Chim- panzee and Dolphin. The axillary border is, of course, drawn out where the sca- pula is long and narrow. The most singular situation of this border is found in the Echidna, where it appears as a slight ridge traversing the outside of the blade of the scapula. The postero-superior angle of the scapula may be rounded off, as in the Dog and many others. It may, on the other hand, be very prominent, as in the Dolphin. The inferior angle may also be either sharp or rounded.

(From Flower's "■Osteology.") The neck of the scapula is always the narrowest part of that bone in man's class, but when we descend we may find it to be the widest part, as in some Fishes, e.g. Rata clavata. Passing now to the second part of the scapula, in man called the coracoid process, we shall find that, rudimentary as is this part in him compared with its condition in lower forms, it is nevertheless not at its minimum, for it may be, as in Ungulates, e.g. the Deer, quite rudimentary. On the other hand, it may be relatively larger than in man, as in the Two-

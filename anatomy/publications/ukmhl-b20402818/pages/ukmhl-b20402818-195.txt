IV.j SKELETON OF UPPER LIMB. The clavicles may be fused together in the middle line, as in the merrythought of Birds. The meso-scapular segment never appears to become very large, but the pre-coracoid part becomes very considerable in the Ostrich, where a foramen indicates the line of demarcation between it and the true coracoid, and it is large in many Lizards, e.g. the Monitors. In Chelonians the pre-coracoid is a large bone descending from the glenoidal region down- wards and inwards towards the ventral shield of the cara- pace. It has been spoken of as a true clavicle, as also the anterior of the two bars which, in the Frogs and Toads, pass inwards from the scapula, but which seems to be really a pre- coracoid. The last element, the omosternum, becomes amongst Mam- mals very conspicuous in certain Shrews and Mice ; also in certain tailless Batrachians, e.g. Pseudis and Pipa. It may be that this element is the same as that next to be noticed, and which otherwise has no representative in man. or in any but the lowest Mammals. The element in question is the inter-clavicle, which is enormous in the Monotremes, and forms the bulk of that large T-shaped bone which prolongs as it were ths manubrium ot Fig. 137.—Front View of Left Half of Shoulder-girdle of a Gecko Lizard—Hemidactylus. (After Parker.) c, coracoid ; cl, clavicle ; i, inter-clavicle ; mc, meso-coracoid ; pc, pre-coracoid ; s, scapula; .jj, supra-scapula ; st, sternum. the sternum, and which bears on its diverging arms the small splint-like clavicles. The same element is more or less similar in shape in many Lizards, e.g. Iguana and Monito?'. It may be cruciform, as in Cydodus, or a simple forwardly directed ossicle, as in the Crocodile, or a median expanded lamella of bone or cartilage, as in Angitis and Chelonians. M

In other Vertebrates a definite and distinct brain, en- closed in a definite and. distinct brain-case of solid tissue (cartilaginous or osseous), with jaws and hyoidean appendages, is almost a constant character. In that the skull is sharply and distinctly differentiated off from the spinal skeleton, man agrees with the vast majority of Vertebrates, and with all Vertebrates without exception above Fishes. It is possible, however, for the cartilaginous representatives of vertebras to coalesce into one mass with the cartilaginous skull (as in the Sturgeon), or even when the skeleton is osseous (as in the Siluroid fish Bagrus, where these bones are suturally united). Indeed, in such cases, the transition from spine to cranium is so gradual that it is easy to mistake part of the vertebral column for part of the skull. Fig. 94.—Vertical, Longitudinal Section of the Post-axial part of the Skull, and of the more Pre-axial Vertebrae of the Siluroid fish Bagrus. {After Ozven.~) at, body of first vertebra; ax, body of second vertebra; v3—v'', bodies of the next five vertebrae, each line going to the middle of a biconcave centrum ; bo, basilar part of the occipital bone ; co, exoccipital; 5, spinous process of the second vertebra. Directly above s is the post-axially projecting supra-occi- pital. Hy, the hypapophysial canal running beneath the first five vertebras. The almost completely osseous condition of the skull of man is one common to him and to his class. In the Sauro- psida the skull is often eked out, as it were, by considerable tracts of cartilage or membrane, and in the Ichthyopsida the cartilaginous portion is always more considerable, and may constitute the greater part or the actual whole of the solid brain-case and annexed structures. The shape of the skull will be spoken of afterwards, but

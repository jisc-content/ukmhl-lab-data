213 MEDULLA OBLOITGATA. the post pyramidal ga7iglio7b (fig. 34, e). A second larger whicii forms eminence of fibres and cells extends backwards on the outer pjfj.£^-^i^j^i side of the preceding into the restiform body, where it gives ^^^^ ' rise to the restiform nucleus or ganglion (fig. 34., d). And form gan- lastly, the transverse piece itself behind the central canal joins, higher up, the nucleus of the eighth nerve, and con- tributes to the auditory nucleus. Special deposits of gray matter.—Other masses of gray Special de- substance are deposited in the medulla, both in front and JJ^ay matter, behind :—those behind are near the floor of the foiirth ventricle, and serve as nuclei of origin for certain nerves ; whilst those in front are amongst the fibres continued from the anterior and lateral columns of the cord. A nucleus of cells for the hypoglossal nerve is deposited in Nucleus of front of the central canal, at a level marked by the point of ^^'^^^ disappearance of the anterior cornu. It is separated from its fellow by the raphe ; and enlarging upwards it extends first on the side of the canal, and then into the floor of the fourth ventricle close to the median sulcus (fig. 34, o). Another nucleus of cells for the accessory part of the spinal Nucleus of accessory nerve is placed opposite that of the hypoglossal gorv^^ nerve, but behind the central canal. Upwards it joins its fellow over the canal; and finally encroaches on the base and inner part of the posterior pyramid, from which it is partly developed. The nucleus of the vagus begins on a level with the fourth Nucleus of ventricle (fig. 34, j^), and is continuous below with that of the "^^s^^^* accessory nerve. On the surface it forms a pyriform swelling along the inner side of the pyramid, and limits with its fellow the point of the calamus scriptorius. The nuclei of opposite sides are united below over the central canal by the upper border of the gray transverse commissure. Each sinks and of under the auditory nucleus above, and joins a nucleus for the fy^^f^eaf ^' glosso-pjharyitgeal nerve in a line v/ith it. Above the last two nerves is another collection of cells Nucleus of serving as a nucleus for the auditory nerve. This projects ^^^^i^o^T- on the lateral part of the floor of the medulla (fig. 34, r). Lying over the vagal nucleus, with which it appears to be continuous, it joins below the post pyramidal ganglion. Gray matter at the front of the medulla.—Within the Anterior pyramid a vesicular system is developed, which increases ^gfts upwards, and " forms the chief part of the gray substance of the pons Yarolii." At the front and back, as well as at j^-^^® P^^' the inner side of the anterior pyramid, masses of gray sub- stance are developed, which send out fibres through the

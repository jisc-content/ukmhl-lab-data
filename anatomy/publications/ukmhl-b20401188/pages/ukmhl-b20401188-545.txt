SUPEKIOR MESEOTERIC VESSELS. 525 MESENTERIC VESSELS AND SYMPATHETIC NERVE. Directions.—The vessels and nerves (mesenteric) which Examine are distributed to the greater part of the alimentary tube, to^^utesthie. may be first dissected. After these have been examined, and the connections of the aorta and vena cava have been seen, most of the intestine can be taken out to give room for the display of the viscera in the upper part of the cavity. Mesenteric "Vessels. —The superior and inferior mesen- Vessels of teric arteries are two large visceral branches of the aorta, i^^^^^i^®- which supply the intestine, except part of the duodenum and lower extremity of the rectum. Each is accompanied by a vein, and by a plexus of nerves of the same name derived from the sympathetic. Dissection.—For the dissection of the superior mesenteric Dissection vessels and nerves, the great omentum and the transverse mesenteric, colon are to be placed on the margin of the ribs (fig. 77), and one layer (anterior) of the mesentery is to be removed. Whilst tracing the branches of the artery to the small intes- tine the student will meet with corresponding veins, and with offsets of the sympathetic nerves on the arteries. Some mesenteric glands and a few lacteal vessels will come into view at the same time. The branches from the right side of the vessel to the large intestine are to be next followed. After all the branches have been cleaned, the trunk of the artery should be traced back beneath the pancreas ("), and the plexus of nerves surrounding it should be defined. The siiperior mesenteric artery (fig. 77, a) supplies branches Superior wholly to the small intestine beyond the duodenal part, and ^teryl^^^^^ to half the large intestine, viz., as far as the end of the transverse colon (/). Arising from the aorta near the Courses to diaphragm, the vessel is directed downwards between the J^^^he^^ layers of the mesentery, where it forms an arch with the con- mesentery, vexity to the left side, and terminates in offsets to the caecum and the end of the small intestine. At first the artery lies Connections beneath the pancreas and the splenic vein ; and as it descends to the mesentery it is placed in front of the duodenum (^) and the left renal vein. This vessel is surrounded by the mesenteric plexus of nerves, and is accompanied by the vein of the same name. Branches.—Whilst the vessel is covered by the pancreas and it gives a small branch to that body and the duodenum. Its ^^^'^^^^^s.

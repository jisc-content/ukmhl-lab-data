74$ THIRD LAYER OF MUSCLES. Dissection.—For tlie dissection of the third layer of muscles. Dissect the accessorius and the tendons of the long flexor are to be of ^j^^^uscles cut through near the calcaneum, and turned towards the toes. Whilst raising the tendons the external plantar nerve and artery are not to be interfered with, and two small nerves to the outer two lumbricales are to be looked for. Afterwards the areolar tissue is to be taken from the muscles now brought into view. Third layer of muscles.—Only the short muscles of the Third layer great and little toes enter into this layer. On the metatarsal muscles, bone of the great toe the flexor brevis poUicis lies, and external to it is the adductor pollicis; on the metatarsal bone of the little toe is the flexor brevis minimi digiti. Crossing the heads of the metatarsal bones is the trans- versalis pedis muscle. The fleshy mass between the adductor pollicis and the short flexor of the little toe consists of the interossei muscles of the next layer. The FLEXOR BREVIS POLLICIS muscle is tendinous and Flexor bre- pointed at the posterior part, but bifurcated in front. It is po^icis. attached posteriorly to the inner border of the cuboid bone, Origin, and to a prolongation from the tendon of the tibialis posticus to the outer two cuneiform bones. Near the front of the metatarsal bone of the great toe it divides into two heads, insertion, which are inserted into the sides of the base of the meta- tarsal phalanx. Eesting on the muscle at one part, and in the interval Connec- between the heads at another, is the tendon of the flexor longus pollicis. The inner head, joins the abductor, and the outer is united with the adductor pollicis. A sesamoid bone is developed in the tendon connected with each head. The ADDUCTOR POLLICIS, which is larger than the preceding Adductor muscle and external to it, arises from the sheath of the p*^^^^^^^ tendon of the peroneus longus, and from the bases of the third and fourth metatarsal bones. Anteriorly the muscle is united with the outer head of the short flexor, and is J'^^^j nead of mserted with it into the base of the metatarsal phalanx of short flexor, the great toe. To the inner side is the flexor brevis; and Covers beneath the outer border the external plantar artery and arch!^^ nerve are directed inwards. The TRAN^s VERSA LIS PEDIS is placed transversely over the Trans versa- heads of the metatarsal bones. Its origin is by fleshy bundles P^^^^- from the transverse ligament uniting the heads of the four ^^'S^- outer metatarsal bones, and from their phalangeal articula- tions (frequently not from the little toe) ; and its insertion Ii^sertion. into the great toe is united with that of the adductor pollicis.

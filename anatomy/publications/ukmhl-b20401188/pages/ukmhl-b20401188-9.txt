PREFACE. The original plan of this work is retained without alteration, as its usefulness has been established by trial during tv^enty years. It was devised for the purpose of teaching Practical Anatomy by the dissection of the several parts of the Human Body in successive layers or stages in the following manner :â€” In the examination of a part or region the attention of the student is directed first to its limits, to the superficial promi- nences of bone and nmscle, and to the hollows that point out the situation of the subjacent vessels. The different strata interposed between the surface and the bones are next examined in succession, with reference particularly to the natural position of the several objects and their connections with each other, so that they may be observed in much the same order as they would be met with in an operation of surgery. The anatomical description of the whole is likewise arranged in conformity with the dissection in regions, and each bloodvessel, nerve, or other structure, is described only to such an extent as it may be laid bare in the part under examination.

711 SCIATIC AND PUDIC NERVES. h. The branch to the great sciatic nerve (comes nervi Branch to ischiadici) is very slender, and enters the substance of the ^erve^^^^^^ nerve near the pelvis ; it extends in the nerve along the thigh, supplying offsets to it. c. The branch to the qiiadratus passes with the nerve of Branch to the same name beneath the gemelli and obturator internus, quadra- and gives branches to the hip joint and the inferior gemellus before it terminates in its muscle. The pudic artery belongs to the perinseum and the genital Pudic organs : it is smaller than the sciatic, and internal to it. ^^^^^'^ Only a small part of the vessel, which winds over the ischial crosses the spine, is seen on the back of the pelvis, for it enters the g^^^^ ^ perinseal space through the small sacro-sciatic notch, and is there distributed (p. 469). It supplies a small branch over the back of the sacrum, which anastomoses with the gluteal and sciatic vessels ; and a twig from it accompanies the nerve to the obturator internus muscle. The veins with the sciatic and pudic arteries receive con- veins, tributing twigs corresponding with the branches of the arteries ; and they open into the internal iliac vein. Sciatic and Pudic Nerves.—The nerves appearing at Nerves come the back of the pelvis below the pyriformis are branches of plexus, the sacral plexus to the lower limb (p. 627) ; they are fur- nished mostly to parts beyond the gluteal region, but a few small branches are distributed to muscles of the pelvis. The small sciatic may be considered a cutaneous nerve of Small the back of the thigh, for it supplies only one muscle—the ^e\^ve°ig gluteus maximus : it springs from the lower part of the chiefly a sacral plexus, and generally by two parts that remain sepa- nerve; rate. The nerve takes the course of the sciatic artery as far as the lower border of the great gluteus, where it gives many cutaneous branches upwards and downwards : much dimi- nished in size at that spot, the nerve is continued along the back of the thigh, beneath the fascia, and ends below the knee in the integuments of the back of the leg. The branches ends in the which are distributed on or near the buttock are muscular ' and cutaneous. The muscular brancJies (inferior gluteal) enter the under |j.^^Q^gg|.^ surface of the gluteus maximus near the lower border. A gluteus, separate offset of the sacral plexus is usually furnished to the upper part of the muscle. The cvMneons branches are directed upwards and down- Cutaneous wards at the border of the gluteus. a. The ascendi7ig set are distributed in the superficial fascia ascending; over the lower part of the muscle.

DISSECTIO^T OF THE PELYIS. 602 CAVITY OF THE PELVIS. Definition of The cavity of the pelvis is but a part of the general abdo- tion^^*^^^ minal space (p. 512), and is situate below the brim or inlet of the true pelvis. Boundaries. Boundaries.—The space is surrounded by the firm bony ring of the pelvic bones, and therefore admits of little altera- tion in its form or capacity. Behind it is bounded by the sacrum and the coccyx with the sacro-sciatic ligaments. And laterally and in front, by the innominate bones covered by the obturator muscles. Inferiorly, or towards the perinseum, the cavity is limited by the fascia reflected from the wall to the viscera, and by the le vat ores ani and coccygei muscles : only in this last direction, where the bounding structures are moveable, can alterations be made in the capacity of the space. Contents. Contents.—In the interior are contained the urinary bladder, the lower end of the large intestine or the rectum, and some of the generative organs according to the sex. All the organs have vessels, nerves, and lymphatics dis- tributed to them, and the seroas membrane is reflected over them. Section I. FASCIA OF THE PELVIS AND MUSCLES OF THE OUTLET. Outline of C)n the wall of the pelvis is a thin fascia (pelvic), which the fascia of extends from the brim to the outlet, and covers the obtu- tne pelvis. ••txj rator muscle. At a certam level a visceral portion is directecl i inwards from it to the rectum and the bladder ; and this is : named recto-vesical fascia from the viscera with which it is connected.

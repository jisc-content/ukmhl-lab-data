121 SYMPATHETIC NEKYE. bends down in front of the lateral mass, and forms a loop by uniting with the second cervical nerve. Branches pass forms a loop between this loop and the vagus, hypoglossal, and synipa- thetic nerves. As the nerve passes forwards it supplies the Branches. rectus lateralis muscle, and sends a filament along the side of the vertebral artery. Sympathetic Nerve. — In the neck the sympathetic Sympathe- nerve consists, on each side, of a gangliated cord, which lies nectf^^^ close to the vertebral column, and is continuous with the similar cord in the thorax. On this part of the nerve are bas three three ganglia :—one near the skull, another on the neck of ^^^^^^^ • the first rib, and a third midway between the two ; these are named respectively superior, inferior, and middle gan- glion. From the ganglia proceed some branches that are connected with the spinal and most of the cranial nerves, and other branches that are distributed to viscera. Besides the ganglia above mentioned, there are other other gang- ganglionic masses in the head and neck, in connection with nerve.^^^^ the three trunks of the fifth nerve. Dissection,—To dissect the branches of the sympathetic Dissection of nerve requires greater care than is necessary in following the white-fibred nerves, for they are softer, more easily torn, upper and generally of smaller size. In the neck the ganglia and s^"^^^*^^^- their branches are already partly prepared, and will there- fore require only the following additional dissection to bring them into view: —the carotid artery and jugular vein having been already cut through, the upper ganglion will be seen by raising the trunks of the eighth and ninth nerves, and cutting through the branches that unite these to the loop of the atlas. If it is thought necessary, the two cranial nerves may be cut across close to the skull. The several branches of the ganglion should be traced upwards, inwards, and outwards. The dissector has already seen the middle ganglion on or Middle near the inferior thyroid artery, and has to trace out now its branches. To obtain a view of the inferior ganglion, the greater part and inferior of the first rib is to be taken away, and a part of the sub- ^^^s^^*^^- clavian artery is to be removed, without however destroying the fine nerves that pass over it. Of course the clavicle is supposed not to be in position. The ganglion is placed on the neck of the first rib ; its branches are large, and are easily followed to the vertebral artery, the spinal nerves, and the thorax.

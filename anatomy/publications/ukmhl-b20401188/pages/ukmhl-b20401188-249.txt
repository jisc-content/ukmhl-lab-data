233 YELUM INTERPOSITUM. optic thalamus (the central parts of the cerebrum), and then replacing it, the dissector will comprehend the position, and the boundaries of the great cleft at the posterior part of the brain. This fissure is placed beneath the fornix, and extends is beneath downwards, on each side, from the middle line to the end of corp^us^?- the descending cornu. It is bounded on the one side by the losum, fornix and the hemisphere, and on the other by the pe- duncle of the cerebrum and the optic thalamus. Through and readies this great slit the pia mater passes into the brain, and forms ^^aku^ the Yelum interpositum and the plexus choroides. Where pia mater the pia mater projects into the lateral ventricle, beneath the enters it. edge of the fornix, it is supposed to receive a prolongation from the lining structure of the cavity, by which the interval beneath the fornix is closed. Pabts iN^ THE Middle Line. — The student is now to ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ return to the examination of the parts in the centre of the the brain, brain, viz. the fold of pia mater and its vessels ; with the third ventricle, and the parts connected with it. At the same time the optic thalamus is to be seen. The velum interpositum is the central part of the fold of Vehim, or the pia mater that enters the brain by the great transverse ^fa^er^^^^ fissure. Triangular in shape, the membrane has the same extent as the body of the fornix, and reaches in front to the foramen of Monro.. The upper surface is in contact with is over third tlie fornix, to which it supplies vessels ; and the lower sur- face looks to the third ventricle, and covers the pineal body, and a part of each optic thalamus. Along each side is a its lateral vascular and fringed roll of the membrane (choroid plexus). The choroid plexus (fig. 36, e,) is the red, somewhat j-o^^J^pi^xus rounded, and divided margin of the fold of pia mater in the of the late- interior of the brain. The lower end is larger than the tricle.^' upper, and each is described as extending from the foramen of Monro to the extremity of the descending cornu. On its surface the choroid plexus is villous; and the villi are minutely subdivided, and covered by flattened nucleated epithelium, like that on the surface of the ventricle, with fat granules and pigment in the cells. Vessels of the velum.—Some small arteries have been J^g^^g^um already traced to the velum and the choroid plexus from the Arteries; cerebral and cerebellar arteries (p. 193). These supply branches to the surrounding cerebral substance. The veins veins; of the choroid plexus receive branches from the ventricle, and end in the following. * Particles of brain sand, like that in the pineal body, are sometimes present in the choroid plexus.

DISSECTIOK OF THE PELVIS. 642 One septal The septal process extends along the body of the penis, and is thicker and more perfect behind than in front. At the point of junction of the crura of the penis, this partition separates the enclosed cavity of the organ into two parts ; which is im- hut as it reaches forwards it becomes less strong, and is perfect; pierced by elongated apertures (fig. 95, which give it the appearance of a comb, from which the name septum peclini- forme is derived. Through the intervals in the septum the how vessels in the corpora cavernosa communicate. It is formed, formed; above said, by the circular fibres of the cavernous bodies, and nu- The cavernous or trabecular structure is a network of fine bands and ^^rds, which fills the interior of the corpora cavernosa. The cords to processes are thinner towards the centre than at the circum- work^ ne - ^q^q^^qq qÂ£ fibrous case; and the areolar spaces are larger in the middle and at the fore part of the contained cavity, Fig. 96.* c than at the circumference or in the crura of the penis. In In the cords addition to white fibrous tissue, the trabeculse contain elastic cular fibres, fibres and involuntary muscular fibres (Mtiller). The cellular structure may be demonstrated by sections of the penis after it has been distended with air and dried. * Magnified view of the trabecular structure and arteries of the penis (Miiller). a.

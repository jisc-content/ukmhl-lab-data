DISSECTION OF THE THORAX. 412 sular ligaments are larger and looser than in the dorsal or lumbar region. Those of the Ligaments of the arches. —The Ugamenta suhflava (fig. 64, ^), two to each SO named from their colour, are situate between the neural arches of the vertebrae, and close the spinal canal behind In the interval between the arches of two contiguous verte brse are two somewhat square ligaments, one for each half of the arch, which approach one another along the middle line Each consists of elastic yellow tissue, and is attached above to the inner surface of the one arch, but below to the uppe border, and somewhat to the outer surface of the other neural arch. On each side the ligament reaches from the articular process to the root of the spinous process. Between the first two vertebrae and the skull there are special fibrous ligaments in the corresponding situation (see p. 184). Those of the Ligaments of the spines.—Along the tips of the spinou along their processes of the dorsal and lumbar vertebrae is a longitudinal band of fibres (fig. 65, ^),—the supraspinous ligament. It is thicker in the lumbar than in the dorsal region of the spine, and is formed by superficial and deep fibres ; the former reaches over three or more spines, whilst the latter pass from bone to bone. It is closely united with the tendons space. Fig. 64.* meuts. * An inner view of tlie neural arches of the vertebra, with their interposed ligaments.—1. and 2. Ligamenta subflava.

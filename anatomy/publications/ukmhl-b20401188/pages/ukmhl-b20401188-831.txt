OSSICLES OF THE TYMPANUM. 805 outer side, and is connected with the membrane of the tym- ^^^^^.^gg^ panum. The long process—processus gracilis (^), is a flat- tened slender piece of bone, which is connected with the neck of the malleus at the anterior aspect, and extends into the Glasserian fissure : in the adult this process is joined with the surrounding bone, and cannot be separated from it. The incus is a flattened bone (fig. 12^, b), and consists of Incus, a body and two processes. The body is hollowed at the its body ; Fig. 127.* A. upper and anterior part (^) to articulate with the malleus. The two processes (long and short) extend from the side processes; opposite to the articulation: — The shorter process ('^) is^^J*^"^^ somewhat conical, and is received into the aperture of the mastoid cells : the long process (^) decreases towards the extremity, where it curves and ends in a rounded and convex point, the orbicular process. The stapes (fig. 12T, o) has a base or wider part, and stapes; two sides or crura that are blended at the opposite end in a head like a stirrup. The base C') is formed by a thin base; osseous plate, which is convex at one margin and almost flat at the other, corresponding with the shape of the fenestra * Ossicles of the tympanum separate and united.—A.

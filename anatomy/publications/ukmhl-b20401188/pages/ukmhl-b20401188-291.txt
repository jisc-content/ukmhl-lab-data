Towards the front of the chest the thin aponeurosis, muscles, which is continued forwards from the external intercostal muscle to the sternum, is to be retained. Some of the lateral cutaneous nerves should be preserved. The INTERCOSTAL MUSCLES are named from their position intercostal between the ribs. There are two layers in each space, two layers^ but neither occupies the whole length of a space ; for one each layer (the external) ceases in front at the costal cartilages, ^^^^^* and the other (internal) extends backwards only to the angle of the ribs. Their number, and their depth and size are determined by the intercostal spaces. The direction of the fibres differs in each stratum ; for, whilst the fibres of the external muscle pass very obliquely downwards and for- wards, those of the internal layer have an opposite though less oblique direction, so that they cross. The external muscle is fixed to the outer margin of the o^ter layer ribs in each space, and consists of fleshy and tendinous fibres, is deficient Posteriorly the fibres begin at or near the tubercle of the rib ; and anteriorly they end short of the middle line, but after a different manner in the upper and lower spaces. In the intervals between the true ribs, they cease near the difference costal cartilages, and a thin aponeurosis is continued on- ^eiow.^^^^^ wards from the point of ending to the sternum. In the lower spaces the muscles are continued between the carti- lages (Theile), and in the last two they reach the end of the ribs. Dissection.—The internal intercostal muscle will be seen Dissection by cutting through and removing the external layer in one ^^^le of the spaces, as for instance the second where it is widest; the muscle will be recognised by the difference in the direc- tion of the fibres. Far back between the two muscles, and close to the rib of nerves above, the intercostal nerve and artery will be found. A vessels, branch of the nerve to the surface (lateral cutaneous of the thorax) should be followed through the external muscular layer ; and the trunk of the nerve is to be traced forwards in one or more spaces to the sternum and the surface of the thorax. The hinder part of these muscles will be seen in the dissection of the back and thorax. Each internal intercostal muscle is attached to the inner ^^^^ ^^^^^ border of the ribs bounding the intercostal space. It begins cies defi- in front at the anterior part of the space, and ceases behind ^J^J^iy^^^^®" near the angle of the ribs.

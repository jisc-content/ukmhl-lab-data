GAI^GLIA O^T KOOTS OF THE NERYES. 445 Direction and length. —As the apertures of transmission Oblique in from the spinal canal are not opposite the place of origin of ^" couise. the nerves, the roots must be directed more or less obliquely. This obliquity increases from above down ; for in the upper ^^^^ cervical nerves the roots are horizontal, but in the lumbar inferioriy, and sacral nerves they have a vertical direction around the end of the medulla spinalis. The appearance of the long ^^^^^^^"^ fibrils around the end of the cord has much resemblance to equina, the extremity of a horse's tail, and bears appropriately the term cauda equina. The length of the roots increases proportionally as the Length obliquity, so that between the origin and the place of exit 1^^^®^^®'^ of the roots of the lower cervical nerve it amounts to the f^om aibove depth of one vertebra ; in the lowest dorsal nerve it equals down, the depth of two vertebrae ; and in the lumbar and sacral nerves each succeeding root becomes a vertebra longer, for the cord does not reach beyond the first lumbar vertebra. Flace of union of the roots.—Commonly the roots unite [{^"^^^^^1 as before stated in the intervertebral foramina ; and the in inter- trunk of the nerve bifurcates at the same spot into its ante- fo^amen^ rior and posterior primary branches. But deviations from this arrangement are found at the upper and lower ends of the spinal column in the following nerves :— The roots of the first two cervical nerves join in each l^^^^^^jj^ instance on the neural arch of the corresponding vertebra ; cervical, and the anterior and posterior branches diverge from the trunk in that situation. In the sacral nerves the union of the roots takes place ^ sacral within the canal; and the primary branches of the nerves issue by the apertures in the front and back of the sacrum. The roots of the coccygeal nerve are also united in the and coc- spinal canal; and the anterior and posterior branches of its nerves, trunk escape by the lower aperture of the canal. The intervertebral ganglia.—Each posterior root is pro- Number of vided with a ganglion ; but sometimes the first or subocci- s^^s^ia pital nerve is without a posterior root and a ganglion. The ganglia are reddish in colour, and oval in shape whilst they form are surrounded by the dura mater; and their size is pro- portioned to that of the root. By means of the previous construc- dissection, the ganglion may be seen to be bifid at the inner part, where it is joined by the fibrils of the root ; so that it Each is might be said to possess two small ganglia, one for each bundle of fibrils, which are joined together at their outer ends.

VASCULAR COAT OF THE EYEBALL. 783 The conjunctiva in front of the cornea ('fig. 118) has also Layer in a basement layer (anterior elastic lamina, Bowman), with an cornea, epithelial covering in front. The anterior elastic layer (h) is a transparent structure, Anterior similar in its properties to the posterior, but thicker than it fs^part ^J^^^ (from -^-Jp^th to xsVo^^^ inch), which extends over the J^J^j^^^'^" front of the cornea, and seems to be the basement membrane of the conjunctiva. From its posterior surface fine shreds (c) are continued into the cornea proper. The epithelium is has an epi- formed of three or four layers of scales, the deeper being ^helium, columnar, but the superficial laminar in form. Vasculas Coat of the Eyeball.—The next covering Choroid coat (fig. 121) is situate within the sclerotic, and is formed chiefly ^^^^^^^^i'- of bloodvessels and pigment cells. Its strength is but slight, and it is lined by a pigmentary membrane. It may be Compo- divided into three parts;—a posterior (choroid) corresponding with the sclerotic ; an anterior (iris) opposite the cornea ; and an intermediate ring (ciliary ligament and muscle) on a level with the union of the sclerotic and cornea. Dissection.—Supposing the sclerotic coat of an eye cut Dissection through circularly near the anterior part, as before directed choroid (p. 779), it vail be necessary, in order that the choroid coat may be laid bare, to take away the rest of the sclerotic. The outer coat is to be removed in water, and two or more incisions are to be directed backwards in it from the circular cut to the optic nerve. In removing the flaps some slight connections are to be broken through, but the slender vessels and nerves are to be preserved. The white ring around the eye in front, which comes into view during the dissection, is the ciliary muscle w^hich limits the extent forwards of the black choroid coat. For the purpose of seeing the ciliary processes inside the anterior termination of the choroid coat, let the sclerotic cesses covering be divided, and the cornea removed on another eyeball as before; and after making two or three cuts in the sclerotic towards the optic nerve, the resulting flaps should be pinned to the wax in the plate, so as to support the eye in an upright position. To obtain an anterior view of the tiy an aute- processes, proceed to remove with care the iris, taking it ^^^^ away from the white ring of the ciliary muscle and ligament, and from the ciliary processes beneath, so as to leave these undisturbed and displayed. On another ball, in which the fore part of the choroid is and a pos- shown by removing the sclerotic as above directed, a pos- terior view of the processes is to be prepared. In this

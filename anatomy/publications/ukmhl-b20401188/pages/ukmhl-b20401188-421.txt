SPLANCHNIC NERVES. 401 a. The inner branches of the upper six are very small, aud the are distributed to the aorta, and the vertebrse with the liga- gangnroff- ments. Mr. Swan describes a plexus as formed in front of sets are 1 o • • 1 small. the spine by the union of the branches of opposite sides. From the third and fourth ganglia offsets enter the posterior pulmonary plexus. b. The inner branches of the lower six ganglia are larger In the and much whiter than the others, and are united together large and' to form visceral nerves (splanchnic) of the abdomen. These ^J^^^^j^^ splanchnic nerves are three in number (large, small, and nerves, smallest), and pierce the diaphragm to end in the solar and renal plexuses. 1. The great splanchnic nerve is a large white cord, which Great has roots apparently from onlj four or five ganglia (sixth to ^P^^^^^^^^^*^- the tenth), but its fibres may be traced upwards on the knotted cord as high as the third ganglion. The nerve ^Mch ends descends on the bodies of the vertebrse, pierces the fibres of lunar the crus of the diaphragm, and ends in the semilunar ^■^^sl^o^' ganglion of the abdomen.—(See Nerves op the Abdomen.) At the lower part of the thorax the nerve may be divided into large bundles ; and it may present a ganglion, or more than one on its bundles. 2. The small splanchnic nerve is formed by roots from the g^^^^^jj^^^^ tenth and eleventh ganglia, or their intervening cord ; and in the thorax it communicates sometimes with the great splanchnic nerve. It is transmitted inferiorly through the joins coe crus of the diaphragm, and enters the part of the solar pl^xus. plexus by the side of the coeliac artery. 3. The smallest splanch7iic nerve begins in the last ganglion. Smallest ^ and accompanies the other nerves through the diaphragm. eudsTn^^*^ In the abdomen it ends in the renal plexus. When this plexus. nerve is absent, its place is taken by a branch of the pre- ceding nerve. FoMs in the upper aperture of the thorax. —The relative Parts in the position of the several bodies entering or leaving the thorax ture!^^^*^^' by the upper opening may be now observed. In the middle line lie the trachea and the oesophagus, with the remains of the thymus gland. In front of those parts ^are the lower ends of the sterno-hyoid and sterno- thyroid muscles with layers of the fascia ; and behind the gullet and windpipe is the longus colli muscle. Between the two tubes is the recurrent nerve of the left side. On each side the bag of the pleura and the apex of the ^Je^^^^ lung project into the neck ; and in the interval between the pleura and the trachea and oesophagus, are found the D D

37 EXTERITAL EAR. the cartilage to another, are very delicate, and in some muscles of bodies are not to be found. Five small muscles are usually externalear, described, which receive their names for the most part from the sev^eral eminences of the external ear. Dissection. â€”In seeking the following small muscles, let How to find the integument be removed only over the spot where each muscSs.^^ muscle is said to be placed. A sharp knife and a good light are necessary for the display of the muscular fibres. Fre- quently the dissector will not find one or more of the set described below. The muscle of the tragus (fig. 4, is always found on the One muscle external aspect of the process from which it takes its Fig. 4.* Fig. 5.t name. The fibres are short, nearly transverse, and extend from the outer to the inner part of the tragus. The muscle of the antitragus (fig. 4, ^) is the best marked One to of all. It arises from the outer part of the antitragus, and the fibres are directed upwards to be inserted into the pointed extremity of the antihelix. The small muscle of the helix (fig. 4, ^) is often indistinct or One on root absent. It is placed on the part of the rim of the ear that extends into the concha. The large muscle of the helix (fig. 4, ^) arises above the Another small muscle of the same part, and is inserted into the front helix.^ of the helix, where this is about to curve backwards. It is usually present. * Muscles on the front of the ear. 1. Small muscle of the helix. 2. Large muscle of the helix. 3. I^uscle of the tragus. 4.

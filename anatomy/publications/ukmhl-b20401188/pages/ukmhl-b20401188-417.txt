(ESOPHAGUS. 397 arteries and the bodies of the vertebrae. Opposite the third and joins intercostal space the vein arches forwards above the root of cava, the right lung, and enters the superior cava as this vessel pierces the pericardium. Its valves are very incomplete, so that the intraspinal and intercostal veins may be injected through it. Branches.—In this vein are collected the intercostals of Brandies the right side below the upper two spaces ; some of the J^^^^"^ intercostals of the left side of the thorax, by meatus of the left azygos veins ; and some oesophageal, mediastinal, and vertebral veins, with the right bronchial vein. 2. The left lower or smaller azygos vein (inferior) begins in Small, or the abdomen in the lumbar veins of the left side of the vertebral column. Having entered the thorax along with ^^^^^J^^ the aorta, or through the crus of the diaphragm, the vein ascends on the left of the aorta as high as the seventh or eifi^hth dorsal vertebra, and then crosses beneath that vessel f^^^ ^ ' larger and the thoracic duct to end in the larger or right vein, azygos. It receives the four or five lower intercostal veins of the Branches, left side, and some oesophageal and mediastinal veins. 3. Most commonly there is a left upper azygos vein Upper left (Breschet), which is formed by offsets from, the spaces be- ^^^^^^ tween the superior intercostal vein and the highest branch of the left lower azygos. Receiving three or four branches, the trunk either joins the lower azygos of its own side, or crosses the spine to open separately into the right vein. The (ESOPHAGUS is a hollow muscular tube which extends ^p^^^f^J^ from the pharynx to the stomach. The cervical part of the neck tube has been described at page 128, and the thoracic part is now to be examined. Entering the thorax rather to the left of the middle line, and partly the gullet is directed inwards beneath the arch of the aorta, J^orax and reaches the middle of the spine about the fourth or fifth where it dorsal vertebra. From that spot it is continued through Jjf^jjgg^^JJg the greater part of the interpleural space on the right of the ° ^ sp^^^e, aorta, and superficial to the other contiguous bodies ; but passes at the lower part of the thorax it is again inclined to the phragS.^^'^ left, over the aorta, to gain the oesophageal opening of the diaphragm. As far as the arch of the aorta the oesophagus lies beneath Parts cover- the trachea, though it is inclined somewhat to the left of the ^' air tube ; but beyond the arch it is crossed by the left bronchus, and is concealed by the pericardium down to the diaphragm. In this extent the tube is covered on the sides by the pleurse, and lies on the right of the aorta below

355 CONFECTIOITS OF THE LUNG. extends from tlie pericardium to the back of tlie sternum, ^'^^^^^'^^J* and is formed by the pleural bag of each side. Behind the second piece of the sternum the bags touch each other, but f^f^^^^^ above and below that spot they are separated by an interval, hourglass The interpleural space in the anterior part of the mediastinum st^ape. is narrowed at the centre, and is inclined below to the left of the middle line. In the upper part of the space are the Contents. remains of the thymus gland, and the origin of some of the hyoid and laryngeal muscles ; and in the lower part is some areolar tissue, together with the triangularis sterni muscle of the left side. The part behind the heart (posterior mediastinum) inter- Part beMnd venes between the back of the pericardium with the roots of ckTsesT" the lungs and the spinal column. Its lateral boundaries are larger space, the opposite pleural sacs, which are separated here by a larger interpleural space than in the front of the heart. If the pleura be divided behind the lung on the right side, the extent of the space will appear. In this space are contained The con- the different bodies on the front of the spine, which pass the%ace along or out of the thoracic cavity, viz. the aorta, the vena azygos and the thoracic duct, the oesophagus with its nerves, the trachea, the splanchnic nerves at the lower part, and some lymphatic glands. Dissection.—The pleura and the fat are now to be cleaned ^^^^^^^^j from the side of the pericardium. The root of the lung is to be dissected out by taking away [^ng*^^ the pleura and the areolar tissue from its front and back, without iniuring its several component vessels. In this dis- ° ^ . nerves, section the phrenic artery and nerve will be found in front of the root, together with a few nerves (anterior pulmonary) ; the last are best seen on the left side. Behind the root of the lung is the large vagus nerve, dividing into branches. For the present, the arch of the aorta and the small nerves on it may be left untouched. CONNECTIONS OF THE LUNG. The lungs are two in number, and are contained in the Number cavity of the thorax, one on each side of the spinal column. In these organs the blood is changed in respiration. and use. The lung is of a somewhat conical form, and takes its Form, shape from the space in which it is lodged. It is unattached on all sides, except at the inner part where the vessels enter; and it is covered, as before said, by the bag of the pleura, except at the root. It presents for examination a base and A A 2

INFERIOR CERVICAL GANGLIOK 123 the carotid canal communications are formed with the tympanic nerve (p. 116) and with the spheno-palatine ganglion (p. 150) ; the former being placed near the lower, and the latter near the upper opening of the canal. The communications and plexuses that these nerves form in their course to the base of the brain are described at p. 21. 2. The pharyngeal ner ves pass inwards to the side of the gg^^^p[J^^^^ pharynx, where they join in the pharyngeal plexus with the other pharyngeal branches of the eighth cranial nerve. Cardiac nerves. —The cardiac nerves enter the thorax to to cardiac join in the cardiac plexuses of the heart. There are three p^^^^'^®^- cardiac nerves on each side, viz. superior, middle, and infe- rior, each taking its name from the ganglion of which it is an offset. 3. The superior or superficial cardiac nerve of the right One nervo side continues through the neck behind the sheath of the piex^ul^ carotid vessels, and enters the thorax beneath, or in front of the subclavian artery. In some bodies this nerve ends in joins others the neck by joining one of the other cardiac nerves. In the ^^^^ neck the nerve is connected with the cardiac branch of the vagus, with the external laryngeal, and with the recurrent nerve. The MIDDLE CERVICAL GANGLION (gang, thyroideum) is of Middle small size, and is situate opposite the fifth cervical vertebra, usually on or near the inferior thyroid artery. It is of a Situation, roundish shape, and lies beneath the great cervical vessels. Its branches are the foUowiug :— Connecting branches with the spinal nerves pass outwards, is joined to and sink between the borders of the longus colli and anterior ^^^^^l^ scalenus to join the fifth and sixth cervical nerves. Branches for Distribution. —These consist of nerves to the and gives thyroid body, together with the middle cardiac nerve. 1. The thyroid brancYucs ramify around the inferior thyroid thyroid artery, and end in the thyroid body ; they join the ®^ external laryngeal and recurrent laryngeal nerves. 2. The middle or great cardiac nerve descends to the ^^^^^^^^^ thorax across the subclavian artery ; its termination in the cardiac plexus will be seen in the chest. In the neck it communicates with the upper cardiac and recurrent laryngeal nerves. The INFERIOR CERVICAL GANGLION is irreo^ular in shape, inferior . Sfansflion. and occupies the interval between the first rib and the lateral mass of the last cervical vertebra, its position being internal to the superior intercostal artery. Oftentimes it is on neck of extends in front of the neck of the rib, and joins the first ^^^^

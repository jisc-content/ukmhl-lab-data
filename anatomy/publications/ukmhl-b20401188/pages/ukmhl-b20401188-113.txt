The lower branch is in direction the continuation of the lower, nerve. Its offsets are inclined towards the angle of the mouth, supplying the integument, together with the bucci- nator muscle and the lining mucous membrane. This branch is united freely with the facial nerve, and forms a kind of plexus. B. The LARGER PART of the inferior maxillary nerve Sensory ends in three trunks, auriculo-temporal, dental, and gusta- iJferk)?^ tory. A few of the fibres of the small (motor) root of the maxillary, fifth are applied to this part, and are conveyed by it to Conveys a certain muscles, viz. tensor tympani, circumflexus palati, fibres!°*°^ internal pterygoid, and mylo-hyoideus and digastricus. The AURICULO-TEMPORAL NERVE Separates from the others Auricuio- near the base of the skull, and has commonly two roots. diviSor?^ Its course to the surface of the head is first backwards beneath the external pterygoid muscle, as far as the inner lies beneath part of the articulation of the jaw ; and lastly upwards with -^^^^ the temporal artery in front of the ear, and beneath the parotid gland. In this course the nerve furnishes branches and supplies to the surrounding parts, viz. to the joint, the ear, and the ^^^^^^^s parotid gland, and communicates also with the facial nerve. Its ramifications on the head are described at page 7. In the part now dissected its branches are the following :—. a. Branches for the meatus auditorius and the articulation, to the —Two offsets are directed from the point of union of the branches of the facial with the auriculo-temporal nerve to the interior of the auditory meatus, entering it between the cartilage and bone. The branch to the articulation of the and joint of jaw is supplied from the trunk of the auriculo-temporal near ' the same spot, or from its branches to the meatus. h. The inferior auricular branch supplies the external ear a branch below the meatus auditorius. This branch also furnishes ^^^'^^ offsets along the internal maxillary artery, which communi- cate with the sympathetic nerve. c. Parotid branches. — These are small filaments that parotid enter the substance of the gland. branches, d. Branches communicating with the facial and sympa- tojoin facial thetic nerves.—Two or more branches around the external ^angUon. carotid artery connect the auriculo-temporal with the facial nerve ; and filaments to the otic ganglion arise near its beginning.

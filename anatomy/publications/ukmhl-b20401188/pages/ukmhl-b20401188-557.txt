537 VEINS OF THE VISCERA. arterial twigs on both the anterior and posterior surfaces of the stomach. h. The right gastro-epiplo'ic branch'^ (art. gast. epiploica Branciies to dextra) is a trunk of considerable size, which descends and^dSe-^' beneath the duodenum near the pylorus, and turning from num, viz.— right to left along the great curvature of the stomach between the pieces of the great omentum, inosculates with the left gastro-epiploic branch of the splenic artery. On the surfaces of the stomach some offsets are given upwards, and others downwards between the layers of the omentum. It furnishes the following branches to the stomach, and the pancreas and duodenum :— Small inferior pyloric branches end in the small extremity inferior of the stomach. P^^^^^^' The pancreatico-duodenal branch (superior) arises opposite and pan- the duodenum, and runs along the curve of the intestine, ^ifodenaL lying between it and the pancreas ; it anastomoses below with the pancreatico-duodenal branch (inferior) of the supe- rior mesenteric artery (fig. 77, e). Both the duodenum and the pancreas receive offsets from this vessel. On the posterior aspect of the viscera is another small offset with a similar position and distribution. c. The hepatic branches (right and left) sink into the liver Branches to at the transverse fissure, and ramify in its substance :— ^^^^^' The right branch is divided when about to enter the one for the transverse fissure of the liver, and supplies the following aifd gaii^^ small artery to the gall bladder. The cystic artery, on reach- bladder, ing the neck of the gall bladder, divides into two twigs Avhich ramify on the opposite surfaces, and are distributed to the coats. The left branch is smaller than the other, and enters the ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Hver at the left end of the transverse fissure. A branch to the Spigelian lobe of the liver arises from this piece of the artery. VEms.—The named visceral veins of this part of the ab- ^^^^^^^ domen are three in number, viz., the superior coronary, the veins, viz — splenic, and the portal vein. The superior coronary vein (fig. 79) lies along the upper coronary border of the stomach. It begins in the oesophagus and stomach; the left part of the stomach, and joins the vena portse at the pylorus. The splenic vein (fig'. 79, b) is of laraje size, and is formed splenic from ^ \ 5 • J / s > the spleen, * This artery is named commonly gastro-duodenal as far as to the spot where it gives off the branch to the duodenum and pancrea-s.

THE INTEENAL JUGULAR VEIN. Ill this difference. Thus, below that muscle, the internal where it is carotid is contained in the anterior triangular space, being ^eiow^^^^^ overlapped by the sterno-mastoid, and covered by the common teguments, fascia, and platysma, and is on the same level as the external carotid, though farther back. But, but deep above that muscle, the vessel is placed deeply beneath the ^^^ve; external carotid artery and the parotid gland, and is crossed by the styloid process and the stylo-pharyngeus muscle, by the glosso-pharyngeal nerve and its branches, and by the pharyngeal branch of the vagus nerve. Whilst in the neck resting on the internal carotid lies on the rectus capitis anticus major ^^^s^^ muscle, which separates it from the vertebrae, also on the superior laryngeal and sympathetic nerves. Accompanying withinter- the artery is the internal jugular vein, which is placed on the ^ein and^'^^ outer side ; and between the two vessels and parallel to vagus, them is the pneumo-gastric nerve. This part of the artery remains much the same in size to the end, and usually does not furnish any branch. Part in the temporal hone.—In the carotid canal the tor- Second part tuous course of the vessel commences. Following the {Jo^e^^^^^^ winding of its canal, the artery first ascends in front of the inner ear (cochlea and tympanum) ; next it is directed for- wards almost horizontally ; and lastly it turns upwards into the cranium opposite the foramen lacerum (basis cranii). Branches of the sympathetic nerve surround the carotid in the temporal bone. Whilst in the temporal bone the artery supplies a small offset to the branch to the cavity of the tympanum. tympanum. The cranial part of the artery is described with the base Third part, of the skull (see p. 21). Peculiarities in the carotid.—The length of the internal carotid Peculiarities vessel varies in a given number of bodies, both from difference in length, the length of the neck, and in the point of division of the common carotid trunk. The course of the vessel may be very tortuous, direction, instead of being straight. It has been already said (p. 81), that the internal carotid may and origin, arise sometimes from the arch of the aorta. Further, this vessel may be absent from the neck : in such case Absence, the common carotid may take its place, and give the usual offsets of the external carotid. In one instance (Quain) where the artery was deficient in the neck, two branches of the internal maxillary en- tered the skull, and formed by their union a substitute for it in the cranium. The INTERNAL JUGULAR VEIN is COntinuOUS with the internal lateral sinus of the skull, and extends from the foramen ^^'efn^^"" jugulare to the sterno-clavicular articulation. At the lower joins in-

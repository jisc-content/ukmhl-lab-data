ROOTS OF THE NERVES. though, they are much less marked than in the membrane on the brain, and from them offsets enter the cord. In its substance are many nerves ; these were supposed by Pur- kinje to be derived from the sympathetic, but Remak shows that their chief source is from the posterior roots of the spinal nerves. Dissection.—The arachnoid membrane is to be taken from Dissection the fibrils of the roots of one nerve j and the roots of the nerves, nerve are to be traced outwards to their transmission through two apertures in the dura mater. One or more of the lumbar ofisets of the dura mater, which have been cut of some length, are to be laid open to show the contained ganglion. The student should define one ganglion, and should trace the roots of the nerve to their union beyond the ganglion. Spinal Nerves.—The spinal nerves are thirty-one in ^J^^:^'!^! number ; and their trunks are constructed by the blending nerves.^ together of two roots (anterior and posterior) in the inter- vertebral foramina (fig. (17). They are divided into groups corresponding with the fj^^^rrange- regional subdivisions of the spinal column, viz., cervical, meat in dorsal, lumbar, sacral, and coccygeal. In each group the nerves are equal to the number of the vertebrae, except in the cervical region of the spine where they are eight, and in the coccygeal region where there is only one. In conse- ^f^^^JJ^^ quence of the cervical nerves exceeding the number of the below the vertebrae, the last is placed below the seventh vertebra ; and the lowest nerve of each group, except the coccygeal^ will be below its corresponding vertebra. Each nerve divides into two, viz., anterior and posterior Primary primary branches ; the former of these is distributed to the front of the body and the limbs, and the latter is confined to the hinder part of the trunk. Hoots of the Nerves.—Two roots or bundles of fibrils Each nerve (anterior and posterior) attach the nerve to the spinal cord ; JootsJ^*^ and these unite together to form the trunk of the nerve anterior either in the intervertebral foramen, or, it may be, in the terior.^^ spinal canal. The posterior root is marked by a ganglion, but the anterior root is aganglionic. The posterior or ganglionic roots (fig. Q7, s) surpass in -^^^^^^^g^^^ size the anterior, and are formed by larger and more nume- larger than reus fibrils. They are attached to the side of the cord interior: between the posterior and lateral columns in a straight line, which they keep even to the last nerve. In their course to bundles the trunk of the nerve the fibrils pass outwards, converging

CHAPTEE XI. DISSECTION OF THE EAR. The organ of hearing is made np of many complex parts, fnts!^^*^' which are lodged in, or are attached to the surface of the temporal bone. The fundamental part in this organ, as in the eyeball, is S^e^ele- an expansion of a special nerve over a membrane containing meutsoftiie fluid. For its protection this structure is enclosed in bone, hearhig. It is surrounded by certain accessory bodies which collect, and convey to it the undulations of sound. The several parts constituting the auditory apparatus may nieix?into be arranged into those outside, and those within the sub- ^^^^ sets, stance of the temporal bone. The external set (outer ear), which may be first examined, include the pinna or auricle, and the auditory canal : the former has been noticed at page 36, and the latter is described below\ The AUDITORY CANAL (jYiecitus auclitovius exteTTius) is the canal. ^ passage which leads from the pinna to a cavity in the tem- poral bone named the tympanum, and transmits inwards sounds. Dissection.â€”To obtain a view of this canal, a recent tem- ^fiTa^view poral bone is to be taken, to which the cartilaginous pinna it. remains attached. After the soft parts are removed, the squamous part of the bone in front of the Glasserian fissure is to be sawn off; and the fore part of the meatus, except the portion below that gives support to the thin membrana tympani, is to be cut away with a bone forceps. This canal is about one inch and a quarter in length, and is formed partly by bone, and partly by cartilage and mem- brane. It is directed forwards somewhat obliquely ; and Direction, sometimes it is bent downwards rather beyond the middle, so that the floor slopes from that spot both outwards and inwards. In shape it is rather flattened from before back- Size and wards ; and it is narrowest in the osseous part. The outer

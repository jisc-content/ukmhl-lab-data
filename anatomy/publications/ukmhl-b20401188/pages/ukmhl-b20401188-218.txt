DISSECTION OF THE BRAIIT. 202 ring) (fig. 35, has a surface attaclinient to the floor of the fourth ventricle and the restiform body. The nerve is very soft, for it obtains its neurilemma, and therewith its con- sistence, only in the meatus auditorius. Deep origin ^^^P origin.—The facial nerve penetrates to the floor of the of facial; fourth ventricle, and arises from the same nucleus as the sixth nerve which it joins (Clarke*), of auditory. The fasciculus of the root of the auditory nerve which reaches the floor of the fourth ventricle, bends backwards over the restiform body to the auditory nucleus ; and some arciform fibres out of the median sulcus are joined with this part of the root. The other fasciculus pierces the restiform body, and takes origin from a network connected with the outer part of the posterior pyramid (Clarke). Eighth The EIGHTH CRANIAL KERVE (Willis) (fig. 30, ^) is placed three parts ^^^^ ^^^^ medulla oblongata, and consists of three distinct trunks, glosso-pharyngeal, pneumo-gastric, and spinal accessory : the names of the first two indicate their destination, and the last, besides being accessory to the pneumo-gastric, supplies some muscles.

The pneumo-gastric or vagus (tenth nerve, Sommerring) (fig. 35, is connected with the lateral tract of the medulla, below the glosso-pharyngeal nerve, by a series of filaments, which are collected at first into bundles, but are finally gathered into one flat band. spinal acces- c.

Finally this fasciculus throws itself into the pneumo-gastric nerve outside the skull. (See p. 119.) pinal: The spinal part is firm and round, like the third or the sixth nerve, but only a small piece of it can be seen. It arises by a number of fine filaments from the lateral surface or column of the spinal cord, as low as the sixth cervical nerve ; the lowest roots are attached near the lateral fissure and the posterior roots of the nerves, whilst the highest are * On the Structure of the Medulla Oblongata,, by J.

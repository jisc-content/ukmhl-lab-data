MEMBRAlsrOUS LABYRINTH. 815 described (KoUiker) between the basilar layer and membrane scala of of Corti in tbe membranous part of the septum of the spiral ' tube. From its position between the other two scalse it has been called scala media. It is said to contain a fluid, and scala media, to have a pavement epithelium at spots, especially in the Contents, sulcus spiralis. . Lining msmbfane of the osseo^lS labyrinth. —A thin fibrous Pibro-serous membrane lines the vestibule, the semicircular canals, and iili^e^th?^^ the scalse of the cochlea, and is likewise continuous with labyrinth; fibrous processes in the aqueducts of the vestibule and cochlea.* On the outer wall of the vestibule it assists in closing the fenestra rotunda opening into the tympanic cavity. The outer surface of the membrane is adherent to the bone ; but the inner is covered by bas an a single layer of epithe- '^'^S- 129.t and^on^^ Hum, with polygonal nu- -^"l^^^^^v fluid ^ cleated cells like that on ^ ' serous membranes, and secretes *a thin serous fluid, liquor Cotunnii, 01 perilymph. This fluid in the interior fills the scalse of the cochlea, and surrounds the mem- branous labyrinth. The MEMBRAJTOUS LABYRINTH (fig. 130) is Constituted of Two sacs sacs containing fluid, over which the auditory nerve is ex- onabyriS panded. The sacs are two in number, viz., the utricle and the saccule, and have the general form of the surrounding bony parts ; they are confined to the vestibule and the semi- circular canals, and are surrounded by the perilymph. Dissection.—The delicate internal parts of the ear, with Dissection their vessels and nerves, cannot be dissected except on a frgsh^b^ne ^ temporal bone, which has been put in spirit, and afterwards * This membrane is considered by M. Breschet to be originally part of the fibro-serous lining of the skull. He supposes that the mem- brane has been gradually enclosed by bone, until the connection between it and the parent structure has been obliterated, except by means of the processes in the aqueducts.—Recherches Anatomiques et Physiologiques. t View of the membranous labyrinth in its bony case (Breschet).^— 1.

CONNECTIONS OF THE URETHRA. 613 The VESICUL^ SEMIJS-ALES (fig. 92, v) are two small SaCCU- Seminal lated bodies, each about two inches long, between the under ^^^^^^^^s; part of the bladder and the rectum. Each is pyramidal in ^^ieir con- form, and has the larger end turned backwards towards the uections. ureter, whilst the smaller is surrounded by the prostate. Along the inner side is the vas deferens. At the prostate gland the vesiculae approach one another, only the vasa deferentia intervening ; but farther backwards they diverge, and enclose with the pouch of the peritoneum a triangular space at the under aspect of the bladder. The vesiculse are contained in a membranous sheath, which is derived from the recto-vesical fascia. The VAS DEFERENS or the excretory duct of the testis Vas (fig. 92, i) in its course to the lu-ethra enters the abdomen by the internal abdominal ring, and is directed inwards along the side and under part of the bladder to the base of course; the prostate, where it forms the common ejaculatory duct by joining with the duct from the vesicula seminalis. The unites with position of this tube to the external iliac artery has been vesicula^ noticed ; on the bladder it may be seen to cross the oblite- rated hypogastric artery, and to pass internal to the ureter and the vesicula of the same side. By the side of the vesi- cula the duct is much enlarged, and is sacculated. The URETHRA is the excretory passage for the urine and The semen (fig. 92), and reaches from the bladder to the end of ^^^^^^'^'^' the penis. Its length varies from eight to nine inches and length ; a half, and it presents one or two curves according to the curved state of the penis. At first the canal is directed forwards the^con-^ and upwards through the triangular ligament of the peri- '^^^^^ ^Â£ nseum, to the body of the penis, forming a large curve with ^ ^^^^^^' the concavity to the pubes. Thence to its termination the urethra is applied to the penis ; and whilst this body remains pendent it forms a second bend with the concavity down- wards, but if the penis is raised, the canal makes but one curve throughout. The canal is divided into three parts, its division, prostatic, membranous, and spongy. The prostatic part (fig. 92, p) is contained in the prostate Prostatic, gland, and receives its name from that circumstance. Its length is about one inch and a quarter ; and its connections are the same as those of the gland (p. 612). The membranous part (fig. 92, c) is nearly an inch long, Membra- and intervenes between the apex of the prostate and the front of the perinseal triangular ligament. It is somewhat curved upwards, but as the bulb of the next portion of the urethral tube is directed backwards below it, the under part

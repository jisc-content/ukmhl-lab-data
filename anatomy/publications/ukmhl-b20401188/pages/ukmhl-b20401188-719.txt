693 EXTERJTAL CIRCUMFLEX ARTERY. Suhcrureus muscle.—Beneath the united vastus and Small sub- crureus, near the knee joint, is a thin band of pale fibres. It muscle; is but a part of the large muscle on the front of the femur, which is separated from the rest of the fibres by a layer of areolar tissue. Attached therefore to the femur in the ^^^^^^^^^^ lower fourth, it ends in aponeurotic fibres on the outer sur- ^^^^'^^^^ face of the synovial sac of the knee joint. Intermuscular septa.—The processes of the fascia lata that intermus- limit laterally the extensor muscles of the knee, are thus ^^^^^^®P^'^ named, and are fixed to the linea aspera, and the lines lead- a^-^ two. ing from it to the condyles of the femur. The external septum is the strongest, and reaches from the The outer is outer condyle of the femur to the insertion of the gluteus est maximus. It is situate between the vastus externus and the short head of the biceps, to which it gives origin ; and it is perforated near the outer condyle by the upper external articular vessels. The inner partition is very thin along the side of the the inner is vastus internus ; and its place is supplied by the strong ten- ^ don of the adductor magnus between the inner condyle and the linea aspera. The internal articular vessels are trans- mitted through it below to the front of the knee joint. The EXTERNAL CIRCUMFLEX ARTERY is the chief vessel for ^^^'^^^ ^^^^^ the supply of the muscles of the front of the thigh. It arises on the front from the outer side of the profunda (deep femoral) artery, thigh, and is directed horizontally outwards through the divisions of the anterior crural nerve, and beneath the sartorius and rectus muscles, to the under surface of the vastus externus, where it ends in branches. Ofi'sets are given from the artery its branches to the rectus and sartorius ; and its terminal branches con- sist of an ascending, a transverse, and a descending set. a. The ascending branches are about three in number, and an ascend- are directed beneath the tensor vaginae femoris to the back of the hip bone, where they anastomose with the gluteal artery. h. The transverse or middle set, consisting of two, and ^ trans- the smallest in size, perforate the vastus externus, and ana- ' ' stomose on the back of the thigh with the sciatic and per- forating arteries. c. The descending branches are the largest, and are distri- ^^^^ ^. scendinQf buted to the vasti muscles. One considerable offset enters set. the vastus externus, and reaching the knee, anastomoses on it with the external articular arteries. Peculiarities in the origin of this artery are very frequent. Thus Varieties in the vessel may arise as one trunk from the superficial instead of the ^^^^ artery deep femoral artery. It may be represented by two pieces, which

CHAPTER VL DISSECTION OF THE SPINAL CORD AND ITS MEMBRANES. The spinal cord gives origin to tlie spinal nerves, and is Cord is con- lodged in the canal formed by the bodies and the neural spinal canal, arches of the vertebrae. It is invested by prolon2:ations of . ^ ,, ^ ° . invested by the membranes of the brain, which form sheaths around it, membranes, and is supported by them in its large canal. Dissection.—To obtain the cord and its enveloping mem- Dissection branes, it will be necessary to open the spinal canal ; but as ^ord^^ a preparatory step all the muscles are to be taken from the arches and spines of the vertebree. The canal may be opened by sawing through the neural arches, on each side, close to the articular processes ; and the cuts of the saw should extend to the lower end of the sacrum, but not higher in the neck than the fourth cervical vertebra. As it is difficult to use the saw in the hollow of the lumbar region, a chisel and a mallet will be found useful to divide the vertebral arches. When the loose bits of bone have been taken away, the ^g^J^^j^^j^^. tube of the dura mater will be seen to be covered by some veins and fat, and by a loose areolar tissue sometimes con- taining fluid, especially at the lower part. The fat may be scraped away with the handle of the scalpel, and the lateral prolongations through the intervertebral foramina are to be defined. Membranes of the Cord.—Three membranes, like those Three mem of the brain, surround the cord, viz. an external tube of ^^q^q^j.^^ dura mater, an internal sheath of pia mater, and an inter- vening arachnoid or serous covering. The dura mater forms a strong tube, and is prolonged Dura mater from the membrane lining the interior of the skull. Surrounding the cord and the nerves it extends along the surrounds 1 Tin -1 1.1 n ,1 r> cord loosely, spmal canal, and forms a loose sheath as far as the top of

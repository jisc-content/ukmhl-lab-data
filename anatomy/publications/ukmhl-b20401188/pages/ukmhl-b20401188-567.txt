THE SMALL lOTESTlNE. 547 Over the surface of the mucous membrane small lentiform Follicles. follicles are scattered, which have a depression in the centre, and correspond with the solitary follicles in the intestine. These are in greatest number near the pyloric end of the stomach, and are most marked in young children. A columnar epithelium covers the surface of the mucous Epithelial membrane, and enters the small tubes, as before men- "^o^^^i^g- tioned. A thin submucous stratum of muscular fibres on the outer Submucous or deeper surface of the mucous membrane has been de- j^yer, scribed throughout the whole alimentary canal. Bloodvessels of the stomach.—The different arteries of the Arteries, stomach, after supplying the muscular coat, ramify in the submucous tissue, and terminate in the mucous coat. From the anastomoses in the submucous stratum, small offsets are continued on the tubes to the inner surface of the mucous membrane, where they form a network. The veins begin m veins, the mucous membrane, receive branches from the muscular coat, and deliver their blood into the portal system. Lymphatics.—Two layers of lymphatics, superficial and lymphatics, deep, are found in the stomach. Nerves.—The nerves are derived from the pneumo-gastric and nerves, and sympathetic, as before said, p. 543. SMALL INTESTINE. The three parts into which the small intestine is divided, Characters, have the following differences in their characters :— The duodenum measures as much as the breadth of twelve i^ength and fingers, viz. about ten inches, and is more fixed than the ^^^^^^ss. rest of the intestinal tube. It is wider than either the width and jejunum or the ileum, and its muscular coat is also thicker, ^^^ckness. Into it the common bile duct and the pancreatic duct pour Ducts their contents. entering it. The jejunum and the ileum together are about twenty feet Length, long, and are connected with the mesentery. There is not any perceptible difference between the termination of the Division one and the commencement of the other, but two fifths of ^^^^^^^^y- the length are assigned to the jejunum, and three fifths to the ileum. Between the ends however a marked difference Differences maybe observed; for the upper part of the jejunum is ends, thicker and more vascular than the lower part of the ileum, and its width is also greater. Structure.—In the small intestine the wall is formed ^^^^^g^^^^^^ by the same number of layers as in the stomach, viz. serous, " N N 2

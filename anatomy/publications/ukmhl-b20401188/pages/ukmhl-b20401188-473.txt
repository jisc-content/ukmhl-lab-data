453 YEINS OF THE VERTEBEiE. ligament uniting the bones ; and they are irregular in are on outline, owing to certain constrictions near the interver- vertebr^. tebral foramina. They receive opposite the body of each vertebra the veins from that bone ; and they send outwards, through the intervertebral foramina, branches of communi- cation with the veins outside the spine in the neck, the dorsal region, and the loins and pelvis. Veins of the bodies of the vertehrce.—Within the canals veins of the in the bodies of the vertebrae are large veins : these join "vertebrae, on the front of each vertebra with veins in that situation. Towards the back of the bone the veins are united in an arch, from which two trunks, one for each side, issue by the large apertures on the posterior surface. Escaped from the bone, the trunks diverge,—one to the right another to the left, and open into the large longitudinal veins. The posterior spinal veins form a plexus between the Posterior dura mater and the arches of the vertebrae. A larsje vein spmal veins ° , are m con- may be said to lie on each side of the middle line, which tact with joins freely with its fellow, and with the anterior longitu- dinal vein by lateral branches. Into this plexus the small veins on the outside of the neural arches pour their contents. Branches from these vessels are directed to the interver- tebral foramina, where they end in the veins at the roots of the transverse processes.

242 DISSECTION OF THE BRAIN Laminae and their ar- rangement. Sulci are shallow and deep. A fissure is present below. the under surface, at the circumference, is the horizontal fissure, which is wide in front, and extends backwards from the pons to the middle line of the cerebellum. The surface of the cerebellum is marked by plates or laminae, instead of convolutions, which are notched on the sides, and form segments of circles, with their convexity directed backwards, and with a concentric arrangement. On the upper aspect the laminae pass from the one hemisphere to the other, with only a slight bending forwards of the most anterior in the superior vermiform process ; but on the under aspect they join the sides of the different bodies, or commissures in the median fissure. Between the lamina) are sulci or fissures, which are lined by the pia mater, and reach to difierent depths : the shallower of these separate the laminae ; but the deeper limit the lobes, and reach down- wards to the white substance of the interior. Here and there the sulci are interrupted by cross laminae. The UNDER SURFACE is convcx, being received into the fossae of the base of the skull, and is divided into hemi- spheres (fig. 39, w) by a median hollow (vallecula).

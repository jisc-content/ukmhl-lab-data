203 OEIGIN OF THE CRANIAL NERYES. attached irregularly and at a distance from the fissure. As the nerve ascends along the side of the cord it lies between the ligamentum denticulatum and the posterior roots of the spinal nerves, with the upper of which it may be sometimes connected ; and it finally enters the skull by the foramen magnum. All three nerves converge to a spot below the crus cerebelli, t^^J^J^^ff where they rest on a small lobe of the cerebellum (flocculus)t From that spot they are directed outwards to the foramen jugulare (p. 20). The fibrils of the nerves pierce the medulla ; and each The deep nerve, except the spinal part of the last, takes origin from a special nucleus at the back of the medulla oblongata, and near the lower angle of the fourth ventricle. (See p. 249.) Deep origin.—The glosso-pharyngeal penetrates as far as the Deep origin vagus nucleus, where it ends in fibres : some of these enter the vagus nucleus, others join the auditory nucleus, and the rest are ofglosso- directed inwards towards the raphe^ which they are supposed to P^^^y^geal ; join. The vagus nerve arises in a special nucleus, but some fibres are of the directed inwards through a part of the hypoglossal nucleus, and vagus; mingle with fibres of the hypoglossal nerve. The accessory part of the spinal accessory nerve is transmitted to accessory a special nucleus below that of the vagus, but some fibres are t^^o^parls directed forwards and inwards in front of the hypoglossal nucleus accessory' to decussate across the middle line with its fellow. The roots of the spinal part of the nerve, piercing the lateral column of the cord, spinal, pass through a collection of cells on the outer border of the gray crescent in the interior (a continuation uj^wards of the tractus intermedio-lateralis) in their course to the anterior cornu of the crescent (Clarke). The NINTH or hypoglossal nerve of Willis (twelfth Ninth nerve, Sommerring) (fig. 30, ^) is placed on the front of the medulla oblongata, and issues by a series of filaments from the sulcus between the pyramidal and olivary bodies, in a line with the anterior roots of the spinal nerves. The filaments of origin unite into two bundles, which ^^^ij^i^^^^^ pierce separately the dura mater, and do not blend together till they are outside the cranial aperture. Deep origin.—The filaments of this nerve are traced through the Deep origin corpus olivare to a nucleus below the level of the fourth ventricle ^^^"^ fourth and in front of the canal of the cord, which they enter ; but some ^^^^^^^l®- join the nucleus of the accessory nerve, and others bend inwards to decussate through the raphe with the nerve of the opposite side (Clarke).

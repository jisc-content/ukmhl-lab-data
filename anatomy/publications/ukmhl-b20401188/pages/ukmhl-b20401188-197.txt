INTERTEANSVERSE MUSCLES. 181 muscle, those wliicli sometimes extend out as far as the head of the first ribj are ^ attached separately by tendon to the anterior transverse processes of one or two of the lovv^er cer- vical vertebriBe. In contact with the anterior surface of this Parts in muscle is the pharynx. The inner border is at some distance ^^f^^ inferiorly from the muscle of the opposite side, but superiorly only the pointed anterior common ligament of the spine separates the two. The outer border is contiguous to the scalenus, to the vertebral vessels, and to the rectus capitis anticus major muscle. The RECTUS CAPITIS ANTICUS MAJOR (fig. 23, ^) is external Rectus to the preceding muscle, and is largest at its upper end. Its major! origin is by pointed tendinous slips from the summits of the Origin, anterior transverse processes (parapophyses) of four cervical vertebrse (sixth, fifth, fourth, and third); and the fibres ascend to be inserted into the basilar process of the occipital insertion, bone, in front of the foramen magnum. The anterior sur- Connec- face of the muscle is covered by the pharynx, and by the carotid artery and the numerous nerves near the base of the skull. This muscle partly conceals the following one. At its insertion the rectus is fleshy, and reaches from the middle line to the temporal bone. The RECTUS CAPITIS ANTICUS MINOR (fig. 23, '^), is a small f^^^^^ flat muscle that arises from the anterior transverse process minor is (parapophysis), and partly from the body of the atlas ; and preceding, ascending is inserted into the basilar process of the occipital bone between the foramen magnum and the preceding muscle, and half an inch from its fellow. The anterior primary branch of the suboccipital nerve lies between the borders of this muscle and the rectus capitis lateralis. Dissection.—The small intertransversales will come into J^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ view when the other muscles have been removed from the transver- front and back of the transverse processes. By tracing to- wards the spine the anterior primary branch of one of the cervical nerves, the muscles will be readily found, for they are placed on the sides of the nerve, After the muscles and nerves have been examined, the tips of the conjoined transverse processes may be cut off to lay bare the vertebral artery. The INTERTRANSVERSE MUSCLES (fig. 23, ^) are slender Intertrans- fleshy slips in the intervals between the transverse processes, muscles. In the neck there are seven pairs—one for each space. The first pair is between the atlas and the axis, whilst Number the last pair is between the lowest cervical, and the first -ittacii- , ^ ' ments. dorsal vertebra. One set is attached to the anterior, and

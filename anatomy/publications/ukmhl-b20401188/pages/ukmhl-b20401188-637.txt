617 THE EECTUM AND UTERUS. shows traces of a subdivision into three pieces, corresponding with the bodies contained between its two layers. Thus there is a posterior piece belonging to the ovary and its liga- ment ; an anterior, near the upper part, which is appro- priated to the round ligament; and a middle piece, the highest of all, surrounds the Fallopian tube. It is at the free extremity of the Fallopian tube that the peritoneum is continuous with a mucous membrane. A nterior and posterior ligaments of the uterus.—As the Anterior peritoneum is reflected from the rectum to the uterus, and ^^^^ P^^^te- from the uterus to the bladder, it forms two anterior and uterus, two posterior folds or ligaments, one on each side. The anterior, or vesico-uterine pair is smaller than the posterior or recto-uterine. The false ligaments of the bladder are the same as in the ^^7^^^^^"^^.^^ male, and are five in number, viz., two posterior, two lateral, bladder, and a superior : they are all blended in one large piece of peritoneum that reaches from the bladder to the side and the front of the pelvis. In the female the posterior ligament, containing the ureter and the vessels of the bladder, is less marked than in the male, because the uterus intervenes and pushes aside the vessels. The RECTUM is not so curved in the female as in the male. Connections and is generally larger. Descending along the middle of the tum^\iz? sacrum and coccyx to the anus, the intestine is divided into three parts :— The first part extends to the third piece of the sacrum, of upper, and is enveloped by the peritoneum, except posteriorly : its connections are similar to those of the rectum in the male. The middle part reaches to the tip of the coccyx, and has middle, the vagina above and in contact with it. The peritoneum touches the front for a very short distance, if at all. The lower part curves to the anus away from the vagina and lower so as to leave between the two a space which corresponds, on the surface of the body, with the part of the perinseum between the anus and the vulva. The levatores ani are on the sides, and unite below it, and the sphincter muscles surround the extremity. The UTERUS is somewhat conical in shape, and is flattened j^^^^^^J^ from before backwards. Situate in the pelvis between the situation, bladder and the rectum, it is retained in place by the broad and other ligaments. Its wider end is free and placed up- wards, and the lower end communicates with the vagina. Unless enlarged, it lies below the brim of the pelvis.

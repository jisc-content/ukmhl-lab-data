237 CORPORA QUADRIGEMINA. inch in length, and has the base or wider part turned for- wards. It is connected to the optic thalami by two white bands,—peduncles of the pineal body : these begin at the attachment base of the pineal gland, and extending forwards, one on *° thalamus, each side, along the inner part of the optic thalami, end by joining the crura of the fornix. The base of the gland is further connected by transverse white fibres with the pos- terior commissure. This body is of a red colour and vascular, and encloses a structure, cavity. It contains in its substance large pale nucleated cells without offsets, with a few nerve fibres, and some calcareous material (brain sand) consisting of particles of phosphate and carbonate of lime and magnesia. The corpora quadrigemma (fig. 37, k) are four small Corpora bodies, which are arranged in pairs, right and left, and are ^^^^^'^g^^m- separated by a median groove. Each pair is situate on the pairs on cerebral aspect of the peduncle of the cerebrum of the same each side, side. The anterior eminence (nates) is somewhat larger than Anterior the posterior, from which it is separated by a slight depres- Crates}, sion ; it is oblong from before backwards, and sends for- wards a white band to join the optic thalamus and the optic nerve. The posterior eminence (testis) is rounder in form and Posterior whiter in colour than the preceding : it has also a lateral both join^"^ white band, which is directed beneath the corpus genieu- thalamus, latum internum, and blends with the optic tract and the thalamus opticus. These bodies are small masses of gray substance enveloped structure by white, and are placed on the band of the fillet that forms bands.^^^^ the roof of the aqueduct of Sylvius. The processes (brachia) to the optic thalamus are accessory parts to the peduncular fibres of the cerebrum. Fillet of the olivary body.—If the upper margin of the Fillet of cerebellum be pulled aside, a white band, about a quarter of ^^^^'^^^ an inch in width, will be seen to issue from the transverse fibres of the pons, and to be directed upwards to the corpora quadrigemina (fig. 38, i). This is the upper or commissural gg^^^®^^®' piece of the fillet (p. 215), which passes to the corpora pora quadri- quadrigemina, and joins beneath them, over the Sylvian s^^^i^a- aqueduct, with the similar part of the opposite side.

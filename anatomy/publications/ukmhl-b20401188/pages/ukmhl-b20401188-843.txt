VESSELS ATO ISTERYES OF LABYRmTH. 817 man.) And the inner one is formed by a layer of polygonal Inner, nucleated cells, which, are easily separated from one another. The small calcareous masses, or the otoliths, consist of otoliths are minute rounded and elongated grains of carbonate of lime, ^^e?^ which are situate in the inner part of the wall of the utricle and saccule. Within the enlargement of each semicircular tube a calcareous material (otolith) is contained in the cells lining it. (Todd and Bowman.) Bloodvessels.—The membranes of the labyrinthic cavity Bioodves- receive their blood from an artery that enters the internal membrane, auditory meatus with the nerve. The veins are united into one, and end in the superior petrosal sinus. The internal auditory artery arises from the basilar trunk Internal within the skull (p. 194), and enters the internal meatus aHery^^ with the auditory nerve. In the bottom of that hollow it divides into two branches—one for the vestibule, the other for the cochlea. The branch to the vestihitle, after piercing the wall of the J^^f^^^^^^^^ cavity, subdivides into small branches, which ramify over the branous exterior of the membranous labyrinth and the tubes occupy- ^^^^' ing the semicircular canals. The vessels end in a network of capillaries on the exterior as well as in the substance of the termina- special layer, and this is most developed about the termina- ^^^^' tion of the nerves. The branch to the cochlea subdivides into twigs that enter and another the canals in the modiolus. Small offsets from these are cochlea, directed outwards through holes in the lamina spiralis, and communicate together in loops near the margin of that osseous zone, but in greatest number on the surface towards the tym- Mode of panic scala. From this anastomosis vessels are supplied to ^^^'^i^^^^^"- the membrane lining the scalse, and to the structure called cochlearis muscle ; but the septum cochleae prevents the com- munication of the vessels of the two passages. A capillary vessel ( 1 venous) is placed longitudinally on the surface of the membranous part of the septum cochlese, which is turned to the scala tympani ; and communicates here and there with the arterial loops before mentioned. The vein. —One branch of vein is derived from the cochlea, vein to and another from the membranous labyrinth : the two are g^*^g^^^ united near the cochlea, and the trunk ends in the superior petrosal sinus in the base of the skull. Nerve of the LABYumTH.—Only one special nerve, Auditory auditory (p. 201), is distributed to the labyrinth. Entering the internal auditory meatus, the nerve divides into two divides into branches, like the artery, viz., an anterior for the cochlea, 3 a

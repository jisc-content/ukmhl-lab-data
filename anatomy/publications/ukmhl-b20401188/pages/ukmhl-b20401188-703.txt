SAPHENOUS OPENING IN THE FASCIA LATA. 677 Poupart's ligament between the pubes and tlie iliac crest. J^^.^^^J^^'^J.^^ At the lower part of the thigh, behind the knee joint, it part, passes uninterruptedly to the leg; but in front of the articu- lation it is blended with an expansion from the extensor muscles, and is continued over the patella, though separated from the bone by a bursa, to be inserted into the heads of the tibia and fibula. Directions.—The flaps of skin that were removed from Replace the front of the thigh, to follow the cutaneous vessels and ^^P*^*^^^^"^- nerves, are to be now replaced, and the saphenous opening is to be learnt. The saphe7ious opening in the fascia lata (fig. 73) receives Saphenous its appellation from transmitting the saphenous vein. This situation, aperture is oval in form, and is situate rather to the inner i^^^' and side of the middle line of the thigh. It measures about half an inch in width and one inch and a half in length. Its upper extremity (superior cornu) is at Poupart's ligament ; and its lower extremity (inferior cornu) is distant from that structure about one inch and a half, and presents a well defined margin. The inner part of the opening is posterior to the level of inner mar- the femoral vessels. It is deficient above in a prominent bclowT^* edge, for the fascia constructing it is stretched over a flat subjacent muscle (pectineus) ; but it is marked below by a firm and sharp border. The outer boundary is much stronger, and has a semi- outer is firm lunar border when detached, whose concavity is turned down- iuuarwhen wards and inwards. This edge is named from its shape separate, falciform border or margin of the saphenous opening (falci- form process of Burns) : it is superficial to the femoral vessels, and is connected by fibrous bands to the crural sheath, and to the deep layer of the superficial fascia. If the outer edge be traced upwards (fig. 75, ^) it will be found and arches to reach to the inner side of the femoral vein, and to blend be^nat's^^™ with the base of Gimbernat's ligament (part of the insertion ligament, of Poupart's ligament) : the upper end of this border, where it is internal to the vessels, has been known as the femoral ligament. The rigidity of the margin of the saphenous opening is Tenseness of much influenced by the position of the limb ; for if the finger niargins -I -, ^ , , depends on be placed beneath the upper part of the falciform border the position whilst the limb is moved in diff'erent directions, the dissector o^^^^^"^^- will perceive that this band is most unyielding when the limb is extended and rotated outwards, and most relaxed when the thigh is flexed and turned in the opposite direction.

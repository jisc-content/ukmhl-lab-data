COCHLEA AND ITS SEPTUM. 813 When measured along the outer side, the tube is about one forms 2^ inch and a half long. Its diameter at the beginning is about one tenth of an inch, but it diminishes gradually to half that measure- size towards the opposite end. Of the turns that the tube ' makes, the first is much the largest ; this projects at its commencement into the tympanum, and gives rise to the eminence of the promontory on the inner wall of that cavity. The second turn is included within the first. The last half turn bends sharply round, and presents a free semilunar margin (the edge of the axis) at one side. In the recent bone the tube is divided into two passages (scalse) by a is divided septum : in the dry bone a remnant of this partition is seen in the form of a thin plate of bone, the lamina spiralis, pro- jecting from the axis ; and on the outer wall, opposite this ridge of bone, is a slight groove. Septum of the spiral tube.—The partition dividing the tube Septum of the cochlea into two passages in the recent bone, consists l^^^.'^^^*^ of an osseous and a membranous portion. brauous. a. The osseous part, which is formed by the lamina spiralis. Osseous extends more than half way across the tube. It begins in- P^^"^' feriorly in the vestibule, where it is wide, and is attached to the outer wall so as to shut out the fenestra rotunda from that cavity ; and diminishing in size in its progress, it ends in a free point, named the hamulus, opposite the ends above margin of the axis at the last half turn of the cochlea, ^^^point Between the hamulus and the axis is a space which, in the over an recent state, is converted by membrane into a foramen througii' (hiatus, helico-trema), and allows the intercommunication of the passages of the cochlear tube. The lamina spiralis ' is formed by two plates of bone, which enclose canals for vessels and nerves, and are separated furthest at the modiolus. The side of the spiral bony plate which is turned to the lower difference of the two cochlear passages is pierced freely by apertures g^^.f^eg. for nerves and vessels. The opposite is covered in the outer uppei fifth of its extent by a structure resembling cartilage, which ^5^®^^^^^-^,^^ ends in wedge-shaped teeth near the margin of. the bony late struc- plate, and has been named denticulate lamina. Between the teeth and the underlying bone is a channel, lined by club- shaped nuclear bodies like columnar epithelium (Todd and Bowman), and named sulcus spiralis. h. The membranous part reaches from the edge of the Mem- lamina spiralis to the groove in the outer wall of the tube of parc,^"^ the cochlea. Its width varies. ISFear the base of the cochlea width and it forms half of the partition across the tube, but at the apex extent.

LIGAMEOTS OF THE YERTEBE^. 411 The central portion of tlie disc (fig. 63,is very soft and inner part elastic, and projects when two vertebrae and the interposed without mass are sawn through. It has a yellowish colour, and is ^^^J^®? Fiir. 63.* I deficient in the stratiform arrangement so conspicuous at the circumference. Towards the confines of the two portions of the intervertebral substance, there is still an alternating arrangement of fibrous tissue and fibro-cartilage, though the former is gradually diminishing ; but towards the centre a loose fibro-cartilaginous material preponderates, and amongst it are spaces containing fluid. The surfaces of the vertebrse in contact with the discs, have a cartilaginous covering. This may be seen by cutting the intervertebral substance from the bone. Over the centre of each osseous surface it forms a continuous layer, but towards the circumference it consists of separate pieces. B. Ligaments of the processes of the vertehrce.—The several processes of the vertebras have special uniting ligaments :— thus the articular processes are joined by a capsule and a synovial membrane ; the neural arches are connected by yellow ligaments ; the spinous processes have one band along the tip and another between their borders; and the transverse processes are provided with intervening bands of fibres. Ligaments of the articular processes. —Between the articu- lating processes there is a moveable joint (fig. 24, The bones are covered with cartilage, and are surrounded by a loose capsular ligament of scattered fibres enclosing a sy^io- vial membrane.

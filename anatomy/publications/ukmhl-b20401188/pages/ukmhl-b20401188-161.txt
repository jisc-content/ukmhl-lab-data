From the close connection of the mucous membrane with How named, the periosteum, the lining membrane of the nose is some- times called a fibro-mucous structure.

In the lower part of the nose, and in the sinuses, its epithelium is of the columnar ciliated kind, which be- comes laminated or scaly near the nostrils.

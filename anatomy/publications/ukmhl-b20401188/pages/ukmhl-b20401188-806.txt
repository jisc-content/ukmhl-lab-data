780 DISSECTIOIT OF THE EYE. Ending- front. Outer and Thickness. Formed of white and of the nutritive vessels and nerves are situate around that for the optic nerve. In front it is continuous with the trans- parent cornea. On the outer surface this coat is smooth, except where the muscles are attached : but on the inner aspect it is covered with flocculi, and with the ends of ruptured vessels and nerves, and is of a dark colour. The sclerotic covering is thickest at the back of the eye- ball, but it becomes thinner and whiter towards the cornea, where it is visible as the '' white of the eye." Where it joins the cornea it becomes again somewhat thickened. Structure.—The sclerotic coat is formed of layers of white Fig. nr.* yellow tesue^ fib^^oiis tissue, mixed with a fine network of yellow or elastic fibres, which possess thickenings at intervals corresponding * Enlarged vertical section of the eyeball, representing the parts near the union of the sclerotic coat and the cornea (Kolliker).—s.

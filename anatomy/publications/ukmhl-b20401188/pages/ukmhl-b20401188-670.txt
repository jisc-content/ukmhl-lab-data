650 DISSECTION OF THE PELVIS. Mucous membrane of the vagina. The mucous membrane is continued through the lower aperture to join the integument on the labia majora, and through the os uteri, at the opposite end, to the interior of the uterus. Many muciparous follicles abound on the sur- Muscular stratum. Arteries. Veins are plexiform. face, but these are in greatest abundance at the upper part. The papillse on the surface are conical and filiform in shape. A laminar epithelium gives a covering to the membrane. The muscular layer is outside the erectile structure, and consists of longitudinal fibres. Some reach all along the vagina ; others, and these are the strongest, only as far up- wards as the recto-vesical fascia, to which they are attached on each side. Above they end in the superficial layer of the uterus and in the peritoneum, but below in the subdermic tissue. Bloodvessels and nerves. —The arteries are derived from the visceral branches of the internal iliac. The vehis, corre- sponding with the arteries, form a plexus around the vagina, as well as in the external or genital organs, and open into the internal iliac vein. For a description of the nerves see page 630. * Veins and venous plexuses of the genital organs and opening of the vagina (Kobelt).—a. Semi-bulbs or bulbus vestibuli. e.

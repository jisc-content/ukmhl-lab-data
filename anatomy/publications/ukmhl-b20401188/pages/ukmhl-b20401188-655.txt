But out of the body it is more circular than when in its natural position, and it loses that arched form by which it adapts itself in distension to the curve of the pelvis. If this viscus is Dimen- moderately dilated, it measures about five inches in length, and about three inches across.—Huschke. Its capacity is greatly influenced by the age and sex, and by the habits of the person. Ordinarily the bladder holds about a pint, and as a general rule it is larger in the female than in the male. Structure.—A muscular and a mucous coat, intervening fibrous layer, exist in the wall of the t'ig. 94.* bladder: at certain parts the peritoneum may be also enumerated as a con- stituent of the wall. The vessels and nerves are large. The imperfect cover- ing of peritoneum has been described (p. 609), and has been removed. The muscular coat is formed of thin strata of unstriated muscular fibres, viz., an external or longitudinal, a middle or circular, and an in- ternal or submucous. The longitudinal fibres (fig. 94, ^) form a con- tinuous covering, with the usual plexiform dis- position of the muscular bundles, and extend from the apex to the base. Above, some are connected with the ura- chus, and others are in- serted into the perito- neum. Below, the pos- terior and lateral fibres enter the prostate becoming circular; whilst the anterior are attached to the fascia covering the * Muscular fibres of the bladder, prostate, and urethra. 1.

185 LIGAMENTS OF THE FIRST TWO YERTEBR^. 6. Union of the atlas with the occipital hone.—The anterior ligament (occipito atloid) (fig. 24, ^) is tliin and wide, and passes from the basilar process of the occipital bone in front of the foramen magnum to the body of the atlas. The Fig. 25.* middle part of the ligament, which is fixed to the tubercle on the front of the atlas, is much the thickest. The posterior and pos- ligament (fig. 25, ^) is fixed to the occipital bone behind the occipito- foramen magnum, and to the neural arch of the atlas. It is atloid. thin ; and at its attachment to the bone below, the vertebral artery and the posterior primary branch of the suboccipital nerve pass beneath it. The ligaments inside the spinal canal are peculiar in form. Ligaments and assist to retain the skull in position during the rotatory {j^tween*^ and nodding movements of the head. Between the occipital same bones, bone and the second vertebra are three strong ligaments—a central one, and two lateral or check ligaments ; and, more- over, the odontoid process of the axis is fixed against the body of the atlas by a strong transverse ligament.

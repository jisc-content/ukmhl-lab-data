167 MUSCLES OF THE LARYITX. The CRICO-ARYT^NOIDEUS LATERALIS is a Small lengthened Lateral hand, which arises from the lateral part of the npper border xioideus^ ''^ of the cricoid cartilage ; its fibres are directed backwards to be inserted with the thyro-aryt83noid muscle, into a pro- jection on the outer side of the base of the arytsenoid carti- lage, as well as into the contiguous part of the cartilage on the anterior or outer aspect. This muscle is concealed by is beneath the crico-thyroideus, and its upper border is contiguous to ^[jj^^ij^g^ the succeeding muscle. The THYRO-ARYT^NOIDEUS MUSCLE extends backwards in Thyro-aiy- the interior of the larynx from the thyroid to the arytaanoid ^seuoideus. cartilage ; it is thick below, but thin and expanded above. The muscle arises from the thyroid cartilage near the middle line, for about the lower half of the depth, and from the * Back of the larynx and wind-pipe (Quain's Anatomy).

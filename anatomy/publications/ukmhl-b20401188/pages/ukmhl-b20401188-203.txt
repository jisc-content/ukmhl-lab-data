LIGAMENTS OF THE FIRST TWO YERTEBRtE. 187 purpose of seeing the clieck ligaments, which diverge, one on each side, from the odontoid process, and come from beneath the ascending band of the transverse ligament. The lateral odontoid or check ligaments (fig. 27, ^) are And two two strong bundles of fibres, one on each side : each is checkHga- ments. Fig. 27.* attached by one end to the rough side of the head of the odontoid process, and by the other to a depression on the inner surface of the condyle of the occipital bone. These ligaments are covered by the occipito-axoidean band ; their upper fibres are short and almost horizontal, and the lower are longer and oblique. Between the lateral bands there is a central odontoid liga- With a cen- ment^ which connects the tip of the odontoid process to the margin of the basilar process of the occipital bone. h. Union of the atlas with the axis.â€”The transverse liga- To fix odon- raent of the atlas, fig. 28, is a flat, strong, arched band ^hSfis^a^^^ behind the odontoid process, which is attached on each side to a tubercle below the inner part of the articular process of the atlas. This ligament is widest in the centre, and at transverse this spot it has a band of longitudinal fibres connected with ^^sament, its upper and lower margins (fig. 27), so as to produce a cruciform appearance : the upper end of the central band named cru- is inserted into the basilar process, and the lower, into the body of the second vertebra. Its surface towards the cord is concealed by the occipito-axoid ligament. This ligament * Internal ligaments between the occipital bone and the atlas and axis (Bourgery). 1.

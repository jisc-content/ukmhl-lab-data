BRANCHES OF AORTA. 395 The artery of the right lung arises in common with one one right, of the left bronchial arteries (superior), or from the first intercostal artery of the right side. Bronchial veins.—A vein issues from the root of each vein of the lung, to end in the following manner :—the right one joins ^he^uuo- the larger azygos vein ; and the left ends in the superior intercostal vein of its own side. 2. The pericardial branches are some irregular twigs Pericardial that are furnished to the posterior part of the cardiac covering. 3.

The intercostal arteries are commonly nine or ten in ^^^^^'{^^3^^'"^^ number on each side, and are furnished to the same number of the lower intercostal spaces. To the other one or two Number, upper spaces branches are supplied from the intercostal artery of the subclavian trunk. These small vessels arise from the Direction to posterior part of the aorta, and run outwards on the verte- costal brse, beneath the cord of the sympathetic nerve, to the spaces, intercostal spaces, where each divides into an interior and a posterior branch. In this course the upper arteries have a somewhat oblique, and the lower a transverse direction. As the aorta lies on the left of the spine the right vessels are Right, the longest, and pass beneath the oesophagus, the thoracic longest, duct, and the azygos veins ; they supply many twigs to the bodies of the vertebrae on which they lie. a. The anterior branch is the continuation of the common The anterior trunk in direction and size, and continues onwards between ^^'^^^^ the muscular strata nearly to the anterior third of the inter- costal space, where it ends in two branches that anastomose with the intercostal arteries of the internal mammary (p. 275). At first this artery lies in the centre of the intercostal occupies space, beneath the pleura and a fascia between the intercostal space^^^^^^ muscles, and resting on the external intercostal layer ; but near the angle of the rib it ascends to the upper boundary of the space. Accompanying the artery are the intercostal with nerve nerve and vein,—the vein being commonly above, and the nerve below it ; but in the upper spaces the nerve is at first

DISSECTIOI^T OF THE HEAD. 146 Dissection of nerves and vessels. Olfactory nerve is distri- buted to half of septum. those of ordinary sweat glands in their position, and in the length and condition of the excretory tubes. Dissection.â€”By the time the student has arrived at this stage of the dissection, little will be seen of the distribution of the olfactory nerve. If the septum nasi be removed, so as to leave entire the membrane covering it on the opposite side (the left), the filaments of the nerve will appear on the surface, near the cribriform plate. On the membrane too, near the front of the septum, is a branch of the nasal nerve. At the same time the naso-palatine nerve and artery may be seen lower down, being directed from behind forwards, towards the anterior palatine fossa. By cutting through the fore part of the membrane that has been detached from the septum, other branches of the olfiictory nerve may be traced along the outer v/all of the nasal fossa. The OLFACTORY NERVE forms a bulb on the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone, and sends branches to the olfactory region of the nose through the apertures in the roof. These branches are about twenty in number, and are divisible into three sets. An inner set descend in the grooves on the septum nasi (fig. 17), and then branching. the roof, and tvv^o extend over the upper half. A middle set is confined to j the roof of the nose. And an external set is distributed on ^' Nerves of the septum of the nose (Scarpa). 1. Olfactory bulb I and its ramifications on the septum. 8. Naso-palatine nerve from Meckel's ganglion.

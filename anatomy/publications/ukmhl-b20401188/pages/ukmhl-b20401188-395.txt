THE ENDOCAEDIUM. 375 tlie apex of the cavity they make a sudden bend (d), and are reflected upwards with a straighter direction and a deeper position, to form the inner surface of the ven- tricle. To allow of this turning inwards of the fibres, the deepest layers extend the shortest distance from the base of the ventricle. Each ventricle has for the most Th^e fibres of part its own formative fibres, which assist in constructing tricies are the septum between the cavities. But some bands are con- mostly , , . . , II- separate, cerned m the production of both ventricles on the anterior Fig. 57.* and posterior aspects of the heart ; for near the base of the ventricles the fibres are nearly circular in direction, and cross the interventricular grooves. When these inter- but some communicating fibres are divided, the ventricles may be boSiT°" detached from one another.f Endocardium.—Lining the interior of the cavities of the Lining heart is a thin membrane, which is named endocardium in ^theheart opposition to the external investment or pericardium. It is continuous on the one hand with the lining of the veins, and on the other with that of the arteries.

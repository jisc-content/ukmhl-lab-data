DISSECTIOIT OF THE UPPER LIMF. 348 Synovial capsule to the articulation. The synovial membrane of tlie membrane, j^^^^ ^ ^^^^^ ^^^^ Joint^f In the articulation of the thumb two sesamoid bones are connected with the inferior ligament, and receive most of the fibres of the lateral ligaments. Joints of Union" of the Phalanges.—The ligaments of the first Janges have joint are similar to those in the metacarpo-phalangeal arti- culation, viz. two lateral and an inferior. lateral and The lateral ligaments are triangular in form ; each is con- nected by its apex to the side of the phalanx near the ante- rior part, and by its base to the contiguous phalanx and the inferior liga- inferior ligament. The inferior ligament has the same mode of attachment between the extremities of the bones as in the metacarpo-phalangeal joint, but it is not so strong as in that articulation. There is a simple synovial membrane present in the joint. The articulation of the second with the last phalanx is like the preceding joint in the number and disposition of its ligaments ; but all the articular bands are much less strongly marked. Surface of Articular Surfaces.—The anterior end of each phalanx the bones. marked by a pulley-like surface. The posterior end of the phalanx presents a transversely hollowed fossa, and is pro- vided with a crest which fits into the central depression of the opposite articular surface in the movements of the joint.

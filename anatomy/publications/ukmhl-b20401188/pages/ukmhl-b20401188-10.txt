vi PREFACE. In this, as in other editions, I have endeavoured to make the work more complete by the correction of inaccuracies, as well as to render it more efficient, as a guide to dissection, by the introduction of such alterations as greater experience in teaching has shown to be desirable. With the view of assisting the student in comprehending the detail of Anatomical Description, illustrations on wood have been inserted in this edition of my " Demonstrations of Anatomy." Some of the illustrations have been taken from the well-known plates of Messrs. Bourgery and Jacob, and from the accurate plates of Mr. Quain on the Surgical Anatomy of the Arteries. And most of the others have been obtained, by the kind permission of the Publishers, from blocks which were engraved originally for the purpose of illustrating Quain s Anatomy. G. Y. E.

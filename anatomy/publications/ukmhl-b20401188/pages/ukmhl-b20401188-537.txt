517 CONXECTIOIN^S OF THE LITER. The transverse colon (^g. 7T, ^) passes obliquely upwards Connections and to the left, along the curvature of the stomach, as far ^L^s^*^colon- as the spleen ; in this course it is deeper at each end than in the middle, and, by being thus bent, forms the arch of the colon. Above the a^rch are placed the liver and the gall bladder, the stomach and the spleen ; and below is the small intestine. In front lies the great omentum ; and behind is a fold of peritoneum, the transverse meso-colon, which attaches it to the back of the abdominal wall, and contains the vessels and nerves. The transverse colon is is most more moveable than any other part of the large intestine, piece of large its peritoneal fold allowing it to be raised on the margin of intestine, the ribs. Small pieces of peritoneum, containing fat, the appendices epiploicae, are attached along it. The descending colon (fig. 79, ^) commences below the Descending spleen, and reaches to the left iliac fossa. At first it is placed deeply in the left hypochondriac region, and is deeper in its whole course than the right colon. In front of it are situation, the convolutions of the small intestine ; and behind are the diaphragm, the outer part of the kidney, and the quadratus lumborum. This part of the intestine is smaller than either the right or the transverse portion ; and it is is covered less surrounded usually by the peritoneum fixing it to the iS:est£ie. abdominal wall. The sigmoid flexure of the colon (fig. 78, ^) is situate in sigmoid the left iliac fossa, to which it is attached by a fold of the ^^^'^^^ peritoneum, the sigmoid meso-colon, but it often extends partly into the cavity of the pelvis. The intestine makes two turns like the letter S, and has obtained its name from is in left that circumstance. It is concealed by the small intestine, which is directed more to the left than to the right side. The extent of this part of the colon is from the crest of the hip bone to the junction of the same bone with the sacrum, where it ends in the rectum. The rectum is the termination of the large intestine, which Rectum, is contained in the pelvis : it will be seen in the dissection of that cavity. The liver (fig. 79, —The liver is situate in the right ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ hypochondriac, and epigastric regions, and reaches slightly into the left hypochondriac. Folds of peritoneum (liga- ments) retain it in place. The upper surface, convex, is turned to the vault of Surfaces, the diaphragm, and is divided into two parts by the suspen- sory ligament; the right portion, more prominent than the left, reaches to the level of the fifth intercostal space.

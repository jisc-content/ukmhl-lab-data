The name com- joressor liemisphcerium hulhi has been proposed for it by that anatomist. The TRANSVERSALIS PEHIN^I (fig. 70, /) is a small thin Transversa- niuscle, which lies across the perinseum opposite the base of permaii. the triangular ligament. Arising by a tendon from the inner origin, surface of the pubic arch near the ischial tuberosity, the fibres run inwards, and join in the central point of the Ends in perinseum with the muscle of the opposite side, and with central the sphincter ani and the accelerator urinse. Behind this muscle the superficial fascia bends down to join the triangular ligament. Sometimes there is a second small muscular slip anterior to Accessory the transversalis, which has been named tranvcrsalis alter ; sai£^^^^" this throws itself into the accelerator muscle. Now the three muscles above described have been sepa- a triangular rated from each other by the dissection, they may be seen to space be- « . - , tween the enclose a triangular space, of which the accelerator urmse three forms the inner boundary, the erector penis the outer side, ^^s^^^^- and the transversalis perinsei muscle the base. In the area of this interval is the triangular ligament of the urethra, with the superficial perinseal vessels and nerves.

Dissection.—For the display of the triangular ligament. Dissection the muscles and the crus penis which are superficial to it, iia^^ent^^^^ are to be detached in the following way :—On the left side on the left the accelerator urinse is to be removed completely from the front of the ligament, and the erector muscle from the crus of the penis. The same steps may be repeated on the right side if it is ^^^^^^ ^^'■^^'■^'^ thought desirable ; but the dissector should observe, before cutting away the muscles, the branches of the nerve to them. One nerve is also to be traced to the urethra. Next, the crus penis is to be detached from the bone on ^^^j^^^^ the left side ; but this must be done with care so as not to cut the triangular ligament, nor to injure near the pubes the terminal parts of the pudic artery and nerve to the penis. The TRiAN"GULAR LiGAMEi^"T OF THE URETHUA (periuseal apo- neurosis) occupies the anterior part of the pubic arch, and urethra, supports the urethral canal. The ligament is of a triangular H H

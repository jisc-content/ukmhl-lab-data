672 DISSECTION OF THE THIGH. external to that vessel there exists scarcely a continuous layer distinct from the fascia lata. In reflecting the stratum the margin of an aperture (saphenous) in the fascia lata will become apparent. Deep part of The deeper layer of the superficial fascia is a very thin ficiaUascia ^©^^^'^^^^^^^ stratum, which is most evident near Poupart's ligament and on the inner side of the saphenous vein. About one inch below the ligament it conceals the large saphenous opening in the fascia lata, and is there pierced by the saphenous vein with some ducts of the lymphatic glands, covers As it stretches across the opening it is connected to the openiug^^ circumference,—internally by loose areolar tissue, but ex- ternally by firm fibrous bands ; and it is also connected with the loose crural sheath of the subjacent vessels in the aperture. The part of this stratum over the saphenous opening is perforated by many small apertures for the transmission of the lymphatics ; and it has been named where it is Cribriform fascia from its sieve-like appearance. In a cSSifo'-m i^^^ia-l protrusion through that opening the cribriform por- fascia. tion is projected forwards by the gut, and forms one of the coverings. Dissection Dissectiofi.—When the student has observed the dispo- of the thigh, sition of the superficial fascia near Poupart's ligament, he may proceed to examine the remainder of this subcutaneous covering of the thigh, together with the vessels and the nerves in it. Take away To raise the skin from the front of the thigh, a cut is to the skill, carried along the centre of the limb, over the knee joint, to rather below the tubercle of the tibia. At the extremity a transverse incision is to be made across the front of the leg, but this is to reach farthest on the inner side. The flaps of the skin may be reflected inwards and outwards, sa ^1 "^-^^ saphenous vein is first to be traced out as far as the fea^.^ienous ^^.^ reflected, but in removing the tissue from it the student should be careful of branches of the internal cuta- neous nerve. Seek cuta- The cutaneous nerves of the front of the thigh are to be nervis of sought in the fat in the following positions :—On the outer front of margin is the external cutaneous nerve. In the centre are ^^^g^> the branches of the middle cutaneous nerve. Whilst at the j inner margin lie the ramifications of the internal cutaneous nerve,—one small ofi"set appearing near the upper part of the thigh ; one or more about the middle ; and one of the terminal branches (anterior) about the lower third, of the\nee. ^^^^^^ ^i^^® ^^^^ ^^^^^ ^^^^^ cutaneous

SECOND LAYER OF MUSCLES. 421 whicli is formed by the vertebral aponeurosis and the tendons sheaths for of the latissimus and serratiis on the one side, and by the posterior of the two prolongations of the fascia lumborum on the other. * Second Layer of Muscles.—This stratum contains Second the elevator of the angle of the scapula, and the large and f^ylr.^^'^^' small rhomboid muscles. Besides these, there will be found in the neck the posterior belly of the omo-hyoid muscle, with some vessels and nerves that turn backwards towards the scapula. * The LEVATOR AKGULI SCAPULA (fig. 66, °) ariseS by ten- Elevator of dinous slips from the tips of the posterior transverse pro- gS^ula! cesses (diapophyses) of the upper three or four cervical vertebrae. The fibres form rather a roundish muscle, and are inserted into the base of the scapula between the spine and the superior angle. At its origin the muscle is beneath ^^^^^^^^^^^ the sterno-mastoideus, and at the insertion it lies beneath connections, the trapezius ; the rest of the muscle appears in the pos- terior triangular space of the neck. Beneath it are some of the other cervical muscles, viz., splenius colli and cervicalis ascendens. ^ Khombotdet Muscles. —The thin muscular layer of Rhomboid the rhomboidei is attached to the base of the scapula, and tw^^.*^^^^ consists of two pieces, large and small, separated by a slight interval, ^ The rhomhoideus minor (fig. 66, ^) is a small narrow Small band, which arises from the spinous processes of the seventh cervical and first dorsal vertebrae, and from the ligamentum nuchse ; it is inserted into the base of the scapula, opposite ^^^j^^^" the smooth surface at the root of the spine. The rhomhoideus major (fig. 66, is larger than the Large preceding by the width of three or more spinous processes. It arises from the spines of the upper four or five dorsal vertebrae below the rhomboideus minor, and from the supra- spinous ligament; and its fibres are directed outwards to be fixed to the base of the scapula between the spine and the lower angle. Sometimes all the fibres do not reach directly Insertion, the scapula, but some end on a tendinous arch near tlie bone. The rhomboidei muscles are covered chiefly by the trape- Connec- zius and the latissimus, but a portion of the larger rhomboid muscle is subcutaneous near the angle of the scapula. The OMO-HYOiD MUSCLE consists of two fleshy bellies anterior and posterior, which are united by an intervening tendon (p. 67). Only the posterior half is now seen (fig

374 DISSECTION OF THE THOEAX. though both sets are attached to the fibrous circles around the cardiac orifices, as to a common point of origin or inser- tion. Some of the fibres enter the bases of the auriculo- ventricular valves. The fibres belong to the class of involuntary muscles, and yet they are marked with trans- verse strise. Disposition In the wall of the auricles the fibres are mostly trans- aur^fcs, verse (fig. 56, a), and are best marked at the lower part. though they form here but a thin layer ; and some of the fibres dip into the septum between the auricular cavities. where they Besides this set there are annular fibres around the appen- vers^f^^' dages of the auricles and the endings of the different veins, annular Lastly a few oblique fibres (fig. 56, c, 7i) pass upwards over andob- the auricles, and are attached below, both in front and behind, to the fibrous rings surrounding the auriculo-ventri- cular orifices. intheven- In the vjall of the ventricles (fig. 57, a, b) the fibres are pass^from^ disposed in layers, which pass spirally downwards from base to the base towards the smaller part of the heart.

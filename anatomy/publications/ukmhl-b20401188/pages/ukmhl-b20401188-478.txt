The sphincter is close beneath the skin, and Fig. 70.* conceals partly the levator ani. The outer border projects over the ischio-rectal fossa, and the inner is contiguous to the internal sphincter. The INTERNAL SPHINCTER (sphiucter ani internus) is situate around the extremity of the intestine, internal to the preceding muscle, and its edge will be seen by removing the mucous membrane. The fibres of this muscle are pale, non- striated, and of a finer texture than in the other sphincter i they encircle the lower part of the rectum in the form of a ring, and are quite separate from the surrounding voluntary muscular fibres. The muscle is only a thickened band of the involuntary circular fibres of the large intestine, which is about half an inch in depth. The LEVATOR ANI musclo (fig. 70, I) can be seen only in part; and the external sphincter should be detached from * Muscles of the rectum, urethra, and penis (Santorini). 1.

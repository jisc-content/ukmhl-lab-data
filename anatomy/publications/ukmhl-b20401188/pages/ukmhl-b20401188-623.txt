603 FASCIA OF THE PELVIS. obturator vessels and nerve are to be cut away on the same In the pel- side ; and the peritoneum being detached from the wall of the pelvis, the fascia will be seen on scraping away with the handle of the scalpel a large quantity of fat. But the membrane is now apparent only in its upper half, apd the po- or as low as the situation of the piece that is prolonged inwards to the viscera ;—to see its lower half, the student must raise the outlet of the pelvis and look to the fascia covering the outer wall of the ischio-rectal fossa. Should the perinseum be undissected, the fat must be taken from the hollow referred to. If the scalpel be pushed upwards in the fossa, it will enter the x^elvis where the visceral joins the parietal piece, and will mark the position of the levator ani muscle between the two. The PELVIC FASCIA is a thin membrane in close contact ^lif^^f^^^^^® with the obturator muscle, and is fixed to the bone around pelvis, the attachment of the fleshy fibres, so that it might be itsattach- called the special fascia (obturator) of that muscle. Above '^^^^ , ^, \ ^. •, , . T around the it reaches the brim of the pelvis for a short distance at obturator the lateral aspect of the cavity ; in front of that spot it does ' not extend so high as the brim, but following the muscle forms an arch below the obturator vessels ; whilst farther to the middle line it is fixed along an oblique line near the lower part of the symphysis pubis. Inferiorly the fascia is attached to the margin of the great sacro-sciatic ligament, and to the side of the pubic arch ; but below the pubes partly closes it is continued from the one hip bone to the other, so as peMsTn °^ to close the front of the cavity of the pelvis for a short front; distance. At a certain level, viz., that of a line prolonged from gives off the lower part of the symphysis pubis to the ischial spine, piecer^^^'^^ the fascia sends inwards the recto-vesical piece to the viscera of the pelvis. The origin of this ofi'set is indicated by a whitish band, which marks also the attachment of the levator ani muscle beneath. The outer surface of the pelvic fascia is in contact with Connectiops the obturator muscle. The inner surface, above the origin ^ of the recto-vesical piece, corresponds with the cavity of the pelvis, but below that line, with the ischio-rectal fossa. At the posterior border of the obturator muscle a thin mem- brane is continued backwards to the front of the sacrum, over the sacral plexus and the pyriformis muscle, but beneath the iliac vessels, by branches of which it is perforated. The term pelvic " is not always applied, as in the pre- Different vious description, to the fascia in its whole extent from ^^^^^

The straight sinus (fig. 1, d) lies along the middle of the tentorium, and seems to continue the preceding sinus to the common point of union. Its form is triangular, like the superior longitudinal. Joining it are the inferior longitudinal sinus, the veins of Galen, e, from the interior of the large brain, and some small veins from the upper part of the small brain. The occipital sinus (fig. 1, ^) is a small space in the falx cerebelli, which reaches to the foramen magnum, and collects the blood from the occipital fossae. This sinus may be double. The lateral sinus (fig. 1, /) is the channel by which most of the blood passes from the skull. There is one on each side, right and left, which extends from the occipital protuberance to the foramen jugulare, where it ends in the * Some of the sinuses of the skull, a. Torcular Herophili. h.

This vessel sends a branch along the dorsum of the scapula between the teres muscles, towards the inferior angle of the bone, where it anastomoses with the posterior scapular artery. Section III. THE FRONT OF THE ARM. Fosition. —For the dissection of the superficial vessels and Position nerves on the front of the arm the limb should lie fiat on the table, with the front uppermost.

To allow of its reflection, skin, make one incision along the centre of the limb as far as two inches below the elbow; and at the termination, a second cut half round the forearm. The skin should now be stripped from the front and back of the limb, as low as the transverse incision, so that the fat or superficial fascia which contains the cutaneous vessels and nerves may be denuded. Between the skin and the prominence of the olecranon a bursa may be seen. The cutaneous veins (fig. 41) may be sought first in the Seek super- fat. These vessels are very numerous below the bend of the ^^^^^ ^Q^^^^- elbow, and issue from beneath the integument. One in the centre of the forearm is the median vein, which bifurcates rather below the elbow. External to this is a small vein (radial) ; and internal to it are the anterior and posterior ulnar veins, coming from the front and back of the forearm. In the arm these veins are united into tv^o ; one (basilic) is to be followed along the inner border of the biceps, and the other (cephalic) along the outer side of the muscle. The cutaneous nerves may be traced out next. On the Trace cuta- outer side of the arm (fig. 43), about its middle, are the Sf outer^^^^ external cutaneous branches (two in number) of the musculo- ^^^^ spiral; and in the outer bicipital groove, in front of the elbow or rather below it, is the cutaneous part of the mus- culo-cutaneous nerve. On the inner part of the limb the and inner nerves to the surface are more numerous. Taking the ilmh. basilic vein as a guide, the internal cutaneous nerve of the forearm will be found by its side, about the middle of the arm ; and rather external to this nerve is a small cuta-

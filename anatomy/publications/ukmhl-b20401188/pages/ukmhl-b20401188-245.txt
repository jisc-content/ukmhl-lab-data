YENTRICLE OF THE SEPTUM. 229 that remains in the middle line, and by detaching the ante- rior half from the septum lucidum, so that it can be raised forwards. (See fig. 36). Fig. 37.* The ventricle of the septum, or the fifth ventricle (fig. 36, c), Fifth veu- exists in the anterior part of the ventricular partition, where the depth is greatest. Like the septum that contains it, its largest part is in front. In the adult it is a closed space, but in the fetus it opens inferiorly into the third ventricle between the pillars of the fornix. Its surface has an epi- thelial covering like that in the lateral ventricles. Dissection.â€”The fornix should be next examined. To Dissection, lay bare this body the posterior part of the corpus callosum should be detached with care from it, and thrown backwards; and the septum lucidum should also be removed from its upper surface. ^' Vertical section through the raiddle of the encephalon (Sommer- ring). a and b.

493 NERVES m ABDOMINAL WALL. The PYRAMIDALIS MUSCLE (fig. 72, ^") is triangular in Pyramidalis form, and is placed in front of the rectus near the pelvis, ^"^^''^cl®- The muscle arises by its base from the front of the pubes, Attach- and is inserted by tendon into the linea alba, about midway between the umbilicus and the pelvis. This small muscle is often absent. ]Nerves of the abdominal wall.—Between the internal Nerves in oblique and transversalis muscles are the intercostal nerves ; ^^0^^^;^ and near the pelvis are the two branches of the lumbar plexus. Some arteries accompany the intercostal nerves, but they will be referred to with the vessels of the abdominal wall (p. 498). The lower six intercostal nerves (p. 403) enter the wall of intercostal the abdomen at the anterior part of the intercostal spaces. '^^^^^^ Placed between the two deepest lateral muscles, the nerves are between are directed forwards to the edge of the rectus, and through transver^^*^ this muscle to the surface along the front of the abdomen. ^=^1^^- About midway between the spine and the linea alba, the nerves furnish cutaneous branches to the side of the abdo- men (lateral cutaneous, p. 478) ; and whilst between the offsets, abdominal muscles they supply muscular branches, as well as offsets of communication with one another. A greater part of the lower than of the upper nerves is visible, because of the shortness of the last intercostal spaces. The last dorsal nerve is placed below the twelfth rib, and Last dorsal therefore not in an intercostal space, but otherwise it has ^^i'^®- connections and a distribution like the preceding. As it extends forwards to the rectus it communicates sometimes with the ilio-hypogastric nerve. Its lateral cutaneous branch perforates the two oblique muscles. Two branches of the lumbar plexus, viz., ilio-hypogastric Branches of and ilio-inguinal, are contained for a certain distance between p^^^uT the muscles of the wall of the abdomen, as they course forwards to the surface of the body. a. The ilio-hypogastric nerve perforates the back of the ilio-hypo- transversalis muscle near the iliac crest, and gives off the ^ear^iiiac^^ iliac or lateral cutaneous branch. The nerve is then directed crest, forwards above the hip bone, and is connected with its com- panion (ilio-inguinal), near the front of the bone. Perforating the fleshy part of the internal oblique, and the aponeurosis of the external oblique near the linea alba, the nerve becomes cutaneous as before seen (p. 479). The iliac branch pierces both oblique muscles close to the Cutaneous crista ilii, to reach the gluteal region. ^ ^' b. The ilio-inguinal nerve perforates the transversalis near Ilio-inguinal

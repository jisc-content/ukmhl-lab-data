725 THE HIP JOINT. ligament deepens the socket for tlie femur in the same man- ner as the glenoid ligament increases the surface for the reception of the head of the humerus. The transverse ligament is a firm but narrow band, which Transverse reaches across the notch at the inner side of the acetabulum. ^^S^™®^^*' It consists partly of deep special fibres that are attached to the margins of the notch, and partly of a superficial bundle from the cotyloid ligament. Beneath it is an aperture by forms a which vessels enter the acetabulum to nourish the synovial ^^J^g^^*^ membrane, and the fat in the bottom of that hollow. The interoHicular or round ligament (ligam. teres) is a Kound slight band connecting the femur with the innominate bone, ^^fe'^'^^^* One extremity is roundish, and is inserted into the pit in the head of the femur. The other is bifid, and is connected is divided to the sides of the notch in the cotyloid cavity, the lowest internally, lip of the notch receiving the strongest band. A synovial membrane lines the capsular ligament, and is Synovial continued along it to the acetabulum and the head of the ^s'^^^'^n^- femur. In the bottom of the cotyloid, cavity it is reflected over the fat in that situation; and it surrounds the iiga- mentum teres. Dissection,—To see the surface of the acetabulum the Detach the lower limb is to be separated from the trunk by dividing the interarticular ligament, and by cutting through any parts that attach it to the rest of the body. Surfaces of hone. —The articular surfaces of the bones are Articular not completely covered with cartilage. In the head of the the bones.^ femur is a pit into which the round ligament is inserted. In the bottom of the acetabulum is a space free from carti- lage, in which a reddish fatty mass is lodged : this is some- synovial times called the synovial gland. Beneath the transverse gl^^^- ligament an artery and a nerve enter the joint to supply the fat. Section IV. THE BACK OF THE LEG. Directions.—Before the dissection of the leg is begun, the Examine student should make himself acquainted, as in the thigh, ^^^^^^^'^^"^ with the prominences of bone and muscle on the surface, and with the markings that lead to the position of the larger vessels.

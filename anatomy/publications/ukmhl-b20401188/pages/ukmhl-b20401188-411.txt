STRUCTURE OF THE LU^TG. 391 lung is about two ounces heavier than the left. In the male the lungs are larger, and slightly heavier than in the female. Dissection. —By tracing the large branches of the bronchi, ^ and the bloodvessels and nerves into the lung, the mode of vessels into branching of the air tubes will be apparent ; and by in- ^^"S- flating a part of the lung, the cellular structure may be seen. But the arrangement of the air cells about their tube, and the disposition of the different vessels, cannot be ascertained without injections and a microscope. Structure of the Lung. ■—The spongy pulmonary tissue outline of consists of minute cells, in which the smallest branches of Ug^^g^of ^.j^^ the air tube terminate ; and the mass of the lung is formed lung, by the collection of the cells into small groups or lobules, and by the aggregation of the lobules into larger masses or lobes. Each lobule is distinct from those surrounding it, and is furnished with its air tube and nerves, and with its own set of vessels concerned in both its function and nutrition. The constituents of the lung are united by a serous cover- Covering; ing, which is prolonged continuously over the surface ; and ^e^ium^"^ by a subserous layer of areolar tissue v/hich penetrates into the interior, subdividing it into jpieces. These several parts are examined more in detail below. Serous and subserous coverings.-—The coat derived from Serous the pleura is thin and transparent, and forms an entire ^^^'^^^^^ capsule for the lung, except at the root where the vessels enter. The subserous areolar layer contains fibres of elastic and areolar tissue, and not only covers the surface, but extends inwards, establishing the division of the mass into lobules : where it separates the lobules it is named interlobular tissue, and is there free from fat. Bronchial branches in the lung.—When a bronchus is Branches of followed into the pulmonary structure, it is found to divide the luug^ generally in a binary order, and to diminish in size at each subdivision, until one terminal offset appertains to a lobule. In the lobule the tube has a diameter of jL. to 3^^- of an inch. When this last degree of diminution is arrived at, ^eiis"^ ^^'^ the tubes give origin to the air cells. The larger bronchial branches have the same COnstixuent Difference in parts as the trachea, with a somev/hat different arrangement; g^||| ^ubes and they are round in the lung, instead of being hemi- in structure spherical as in the trachea. The smallest branches, and the and in form, air cells, want some of the elements found in the larger bronchi ; and those from which the cells spring are irregular

DISSECTIOiT OF THE NECK. 184: scribed else- wliere. Special ligaments between first two vertebrse and occipital bone. Posterior and preparation and description will be found -with the dissection of the ligaments of the spine, at the end of the thorax. But in opening the spinal canal to see the ligaments inside it, the arches of the three highest vertebrae should be left untouched for the present. Special ligaments unite the first two cervical vertebrae to each other and to the occipital bone : some of these are external to, and others within the spinal canal. The ligaments outside the spinal canal are thin fibrous membranes, which connect the bodies and arches of the first two vertebra in front and behind, and join the atlas with the occipital bone at the same aspects. Capsular ligaments surround the articular surfaces of all the bones, but these will be examined more conveniently after the spinal canal has been opened. a. Union of the atlas with the axis.â€”The posterior liga- ment (atlo-axoid) (fig. 25, ^) is a thin loose membrane, which is attached by the one margin to the neural arch of the atlas, and by the other to the corresponding arch of the axis. Fig. 24:/' Below the superficial layer are some deeper and stronger anterior fibres. The second nerve pierces it. The anterior ligament atlo-axoid: ^g^^ ^4, ^) unites the bodies of the first two vertebrae in the same manner as the preceding ligament connects their arches. It is thickest in the middle. * External ligaments in front between the atlas and axis and the occi- pital bone (Bourgery). 1. Sawn basilar process. 2. Anterior occipito- atloid. 3.

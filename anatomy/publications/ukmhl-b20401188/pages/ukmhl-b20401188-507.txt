487 POUPART'S LIGAMENT. Foiiparfs ligament (fig. 73, ^) is the lower border of the Poupait's aponeurosis of the external oblique, which intervenes be- tween the front of the crista ilii and the pubes. Externally it is round and cord-like, and is attached to the anterior superior iliac spine. Internally it widens as it approaches Outer and the pubes, and is inserted into the pubic spine, as well inner at- as into the pectineal line of the hip bone for about three ^''^^^^^^^^ â€¢ quarters of an inch, forming a triangular-looking piece, Qi^|^yj.j-^j^i^,g with its base directed outwards, which is named Gimhernafs ligament. Poupart's ligament is not straight between its outer and its direc- inner attachments, but is curved downwards to the thigh ; and it retains this position as long as the fascia lata remains and parts in uncut. Its outer half is oblique, and is firmly united with ^po^tactwith * Dissection to throw down the tendon of the external obHque, and to show the triangular ligament and internal oblique muscle (Quain's Anatomy). 1. Tendon of external oblique reflected : at its inner attach- ment to the pubes, fibres are directed upwards obliquely to the linea alba ; these form the triangular ligament. 2. Internal oblique. 3.

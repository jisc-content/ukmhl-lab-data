115 GLOSSO-PHARYNGEAL NERYE. in the lower border of tlie temporal bone, and from it arise the branches that unite the glosso-pharyngeal with the other nerves. After the nerve has quitted the foramen, it comes In the neck forwards between the jugular vein and the carotid artery, Fig. 14.* and crossing inwards over the artery, reaches the lower border of the stylo-pharyngeus muscle. At this spot the courses to nerve becomes almost transverse in direction in its course to ^^-P^^^ - and pna- the pharynx; it passes over the stylo-pharyngeus, and forms rynx. an arch across thes ide of the neck (p. 66), above the superior laryngeal nerve. Finally the nerve enters beneath the hyo- glossus muscle, and ends in branches to the pharynx, the tongue, and the tonsil. The branches of the glosso-pharyngeal may be classed into Branches to those connecting it with other nerves at the base of theJ'^^'^ skull, and into those that are distributed in the neck. * Diagram (Bendz) of the eighth nerve, 1.

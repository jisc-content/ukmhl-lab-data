The radial nerve, and a branch of the ulnar nerve, should be traced to the fingers,—the former along the outer, and the latter along the inner border of the hand. Subcuta- neous veins of the fore- arm are Arch on the hand: radial: ulnar; two sets, anterior and poste rior; median. Cutaneous Veins.—The superficial veins are named median, radial, and ulnar, from their position in the limb. They commence in the hand, chiefly at the dorsal aspect where they form an arch, and are continued along the forearm to end in the basilic and cephalic veins of the arm. Superficial arch.—This arch on the back of the hand is more or less perfect, and receives the posterior or superficial digital veins. At the sides the arch terminates in the radial and ulnar veins. The radial vein begins in the outer part of the arch above mentioned, and in some small radicles from the back of the thumb. It is continued along the forearm, at first behind and then on the outer border, as far as the elbow, where it gives rise to the cephalic vein by its union with the outer branch of the median vein (fig. 41). The %ilnar veins are anterior and posterior, and occupy the front and the back of the limb. The anterior arises near the wrist by the junction of small roots from the hand, and runs on the inner part of the forearm to the elbow ; here it unites with the inner branch of the median, and forms the basilic vein (fig. 41). The posterior ulnar vein is situate on the back of the limb. It commences on the hand by a large branch, ''vena salvatella," from the back of the little finger, uniting with the ofi"set of the venous arch ; it is continued along the back of the forearm nearly to the elbow, and bends forwards to open into the anterior ulnar vein. The median vein commences on the front of the arm, near the wrist, by small branches which are derived from the palmar surface of the hand; and it is directed along the centre of the forearm nearly to the elbow. Here the vein divides into external and internal branches (median basilic and median cephalic), which unite, as before seen (fig. 41), with the radial and ulnar veins. At its point of bifurcation the

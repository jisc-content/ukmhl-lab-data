105 MUSCLES OF THE LAEYNX. injuring tlie epiglottis. The parts to be learnt would be much better seen on a fresh larynx. Occupying the middle line of the neck, the larynx is placed in front of the pharynx, and between the carotid tioiis. vessels. It is pyramidal in form. The base is turned upwfirds, and is attached to the hyoid bone ; and to it the epiglottis is connected. Whilst its apex is directed downwards, and is continuous with the trachea. The front is prominent along the middle line of the neck ; and the posterior surface is covered by the mucous membrane of the pharynx. The J^J^^J^J^^^ larynx is very moveable, and during deglutition is elevated and depressed by the different extrinsic muscles which are connected with it and the hj^oid bone. Muscles.—The sj)ecial muscles of the larynx pass from Six special one cartilage to another, and modify by their action the {^^J^yifxf state of the vocal apparatus. Commonly six muscles are described, but the number is stated differently by anatomists. Three are outside the cartilages, and three are more or less concealed by the thyroid cartilage : they are in pairs with one exception, and are alike on the two sides of the body. Directions.—On one side of the larynx, say the right, the muscles may be dissected, and on the opposite side the nerves and vessels ; and those superficial muscles are to be first learnt, which do not require the cartilages to be cut. Dissection.—The larynx should be first extended, and Dissectioi when it has been fastened in that state with pins, the dis- sector may clear away from the os hyoides and the thyroid cartilage the following extrinsic muscles that are inserted into them, viz., the constrictor, sterno-hyoid, sterno-thyroid, and thyro-hyoid. In front, between the thyroid and cricoid ^^^f^^^^^f ^'^^ cartilages, one of the three small external muscles,—crico- muscles, thyroid, will be seen. The other two external muscles are situate at the posterior aspect of the larynx : to denude them it will be necessary to turn over the larynx, and to remove the mucous membrane covering it. On the back of the cricoid cartilage the dissector will find the crico- arytaenoideus posticus muscle ; and above it, on the pos- terior part of the arytsenoid cartilages, the arytsenoid muscle will appear. The cmco-THYKOiDEUS muscle is triangular in form, and p^^^^^^^' is separated by an interval from the one of the opposite side. It arises from the front and the lateral part of the cricoid cartilage, and its fibres ascend, diverging from one another, to be inserted into the lower cornu, and the lower border of is small, the thyroid cartilage as far forvfards as a quarter of an inch

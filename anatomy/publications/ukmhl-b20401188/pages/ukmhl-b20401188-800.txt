774 DISSECTION OF THE FOOT. tensor of tlie toes. A distinct synovial membrane exists in each joint. In the articulation of the great toe there are two sesamoid bones, which are connected with the inferior and lateral liga- ments. All these structures are better seen in the hand, where they are more distinct ; and their anatomy is more fully described with the dissection of that part. (See p. 347.)

The joint betv/een the last two pha- langes is least-distinct; and oftentimes the small bones are immoveably united by osseous substance. Synovialsac. A simple synovial membrane exists in each phalangeal arti- culation. These ligaments receive a more particular notice with the dissection of the hand (p. 348). Synovial sac. See tlie liaud.

FASCIA COVERIJS'G THE MUSCLES. 595 hip joint ; and at the grooved anterior margin of the bone "^.^^^^^ above the joint is a bursa. The inner margin is in contact psoas, with the psoas and the anterior crural nerve. The connections of the united psoas and iliacus below Poupart's ligament are given with the dissection of the thigh. The QUADRATus lumborum: is a short thick muscle Quadratus between the crest of the hip bone and the last rib. About two inches wide inferiorly, it arises from the ilio-vertebral ligament, and from the iliac crest of the hip bone for the same extent as that band but behind it. The fibres ascend to be inserted into the body of the last dorsal vertebra, and the insertion, lower border of the last rib for a variable distance : and by distinct fleshy and tendinous slips into the apices of the transverse processes of the four upper or all the lumbar vertebrae. This muscle is encased in a sheath derived from it is con- the fascia lumborum. Crossing the surface are branches gi^ej^^^^^^ ^ of the lumbar plexus, together with the last dorsal nerve. Beneath the quadratus is the mass of the erector spinse muscle. Occasionally there is an anterior stratum of fibres at the inner oi- upper part, which is attached internally to the tips of the pavt"^^ transverse processes of the three middle lumbar vertebrae, and externally to the lower border of the last rib. Fascia of the quadratus. —Covering the surface of the Fascia of the quadratus is a thin membrane, which is derived from the hinder aponeurosis of the transversalis abdominis (fascia lumborum, p. 420), and passes in front of the quadratus to be fixed to the roots of the transverse processes ; below to the ilio-lumbar ligament; and above to the last rib. This fascia forms the thickened band called ligamentum arcuatum externum. Fascia of the iliacus and psoas.—A fascia covers the two iliac fascia flexor muscles of the hip joint, and extends in diff'erent directions as far as their attachments. Over the iliacus J'^^^^®*^ 1 ,, , . - . , T . . tendon of • muscJe the membrane is thickest; and a strong accession is small psoas ; received from the tendon of the small psoas. Its disposition beiow-"^^^^^^ at Poupart's ligament, and the part that it takes in the for- mation of the crural sheath, have been before explained (p. 509). Traced inwards over the psoas, the membrane will be found to be inserted into the hip bone near the brim of pelvis the pelvis. When followed upwards it will be seen to become thin, and to be fixed on the one side to the lumbar vertebrae and the ligamentum arcuatum internum, but to blend on the other with the fascia on the quadratus.

In the fat of the thigh on the right side the student should 9^ "-''S^P ° . , . . side seeic seek the inferior pudendal nerve, which pierces the fascia inferior lata one inch anterior to the tuber ischii, and about the same nerve!^^^ distance from the margin of the pubic arch; and should trace its junction in the fat with the inferior hsemorrhoidal nerve. Afterwards this nerve is to be followed forwards to where it enters beneath the superficial fascia in the middle line. The superficial fascia of the anterior half of the perinseum Superficial is continuous with that of the adjoining regions ; and its ^^s^^^- depth, and the quantity of fat in it, will vary with the con- itsthick- dition of the body. It resembles the superficial fascia of ^^^^ ^^^i®^ the groin and upper part of the thigh, in being separable into two strata ;— One a subcutaneous fatty layer, continuous mth that in has two other parts of the body, loses its fat towards the scrotum, layers, where it contains involuntary muscular fibres. The other deeper, but more membranous layer, is of Connections limited extent, and is connected with the firm subjacent lay^^.^^ structures. On the outer side it is fixed to the pubic arch of the hip bone, external to the line of the crus penis and its muscle, extending as low as the ischial tuberosity. Posteriorly the stratum bends down to join the triangular ligament of the urethra. But in front it is unattached, and is con- tinued to the scrotum and the penis. By means of similar ^^^^ ^p,^ connections on both sides, a pouch is formed over the ante- in front; rior half of the perinseal space underneath the superficial this divided fascia. From the under surface of this layer of the fascia a septum dips downwards in the middle line, and divides posteriorly the subjacent space into two parts ; but anteriorly this partition is less perfect or dissappears. Air blown beneath the fascia passes only forwards to the Course of scrotum ; and this direction is given to it by the connec- ©ffused tions of the deep layer with the parts around. Should urine urine, be efiused beneath the membranous part of the fascia, the fluid will necessarily be directed forwards, like the air, through the scrotum to the penis and the front of the abdomen. Dissection,—The superficial vessels and nerves are to be Dissection of traced on the right side of the perinseum, by cutting through vessels on the superficial fascia in the same manner as on the left right side, side. One long slender artery is the superficial perinseal, which gives a transverse branch near its commencement; some-

BEAlSrCHES OF THE SUBCLAYIAISr ARTERY. 75 preceding, takes a similar direction, though higher in the neck, and ends beneath the border of the trapezius muscle in the superficial cervical and posterior scapular arteries. (See '' Dissection" of the Back. In its course outwards this artery crosses the anterior scalenus, the phrenic nerve, and the brachial plexus, and lies in the upper part of the space that contains the third part of the subclavian artery. Some small branches are supplied by it to the posterior offsets, triangular space of the neck. Though the transverse cervical artery supplies ordinarily Size and the posterior scapular branch, there are many examples in ^^^^^^^^^^ which, though holding its usual position in the neck, it is too small in size to give origin to so large an offset. In such instances the diminished artery ends in the trapezius muscle, whilst the posterior scapular branch (fig. 10) arises separately from the third, or the second part of the subclavian artery. c. The inferior thyroid hrancJi is the largest offset of the Inferior thy- thyroid axis. Directed inwards to the thyroid body, the ^^^^ branch artery passes beneath the common carotid artery and the accompanying vein and nerves, and in front of the longus colli muscle and the recurrent nerve. In this course the vessel is tortuous. At the lower part of the thyroid body it divides into branches that enter the under surface, whilst others communicate with the superior thyroid, and with the corresponding artery of the opposite side, forming a very free anastomosis between these vessels. Near the larnyx a laryn- gives larjai- geal branch is distributed to that tube, and other offsets are ^^^^ offset, furnished to the trachea. The ascending cervical artery is a branch of the thyroid and ascend- near its commencement ; it is directed upwards between the bilnchl^^^^ scalenus and rectus capitis anticus major, and ends in branches to those muscles and to the posterior triangle of the neck. Some small spinal offsets are conveyed along the spinal nerves to the cord and its membranes. Lowest thyroid.—In connection with the thyroid body a third Accessoiy thyroid artery may be occasionally present, which has been named ^^g^Q^^^? art. thyroidea ima. This offset comes usually from the trunk of thyroid, the innominate artery, but it may spring from the right common carotid, or from the arch of the aorta. Whatever its origin, the small vessel ascends in front of the trachea to the thyroid body, and either takes the place of an absent inferior thyroid artery, or assists a smaller vessel than usual in supplying that body. The veins corresponding with the branches of the thyroid ^^ins cor- axis have the following destination :—those with the supra- to arteries, scapular and transverse cervical arteries open into the

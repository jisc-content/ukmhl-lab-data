MUSCLES OF THE EYELIDS. 23 The facial vessels and their branches will come into view Facial as the parts are cleaned ; but the nerves may be disregarded ^^^^eis on this side. Near the ear is the parotid gland, whose duct is to be and parotid preserved ; this is on a level with the meatus auditorius, 8^^^^^- and pierces the middle of the cheek. Muscles of the Face.—The superficial muscles of the inthefoce face are gathered around the apertures of the eye, nose, and surr™md^^ mouth. An orbicular or sphincter muscle surrounds the the apertures of both the eye and mouth ; and other muscles are ^P®^^^^®^- blended with each to enlarge the opening in the centre of the fibres. There are three distinct groups of muscles : one of the opening of the eyelids ; another of the nostril ; and a third of the aperture of the mouth. One of the muscles of mastication, viz. the masseter, is also now seen, but it will be afterwards examined. Muscles of the Eyelids. —The m.uscles of the eyelids Four mus- are four in number, viz. orbicularis palpebrarum, corrugator ^ll^ supercilii, levator palpebrfB superioris, and tensor tarsi.'"' The two latter are dissected in the orbit, and will be described with that part. The ORBICULAIIIS PALPEBRARUM is the sphincter muscle Orbicularis closing the elliptical opening between the eyelids. It is a rum^^^^ flat and thin layer, which extends from the margin of the lids beyond the circumference of the orbit. From a dif- Division ference in the characters of the fibres, a division has been p^rts^^*^ made of them into two parts—outer and inner. The external fibres (orbital part), the best marked, are Orbital or fixed only at one point, viz. the inner angle of the orbit. This attachment (origin) is connected with the surface attached and borders of the small tendo palpebrarum or tarsal liga- i^^®^^^^^^- ment ; above that tendon with the nasal process of the upper maxillary bone, and the internal angular process of the frontal bone ; and below the tendon with the superior maxillary bone, and the inner part of the margin of the orbit. From this origin the fibres are directed outwards, giving rise to ovals, which lie side by side, and increase in size towards the outer margin of the muscle, where they project beyond the margin of the orbit. The internal fibres (palpebral part), paler and finer than internal or * The tensor tarsi muscle (p. 51) is sometimes described as part of the orbicularis.

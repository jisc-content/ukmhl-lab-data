345 LIGAMENTS OF THE METACARPUS. the carpus, the membrane sends upwards and downwards prolongations between the individual bones. The offsets upwards are two, and they sometimes join the synovial membrane of the wrist joint ; but the offsets in the opposite and four n 1 1* 1 J. n 1 inner me direction are three, and may be continued to all, or only carpal, some of the articulations between the four inner metacarpal with their carpal bones. Fig. 53.* Union- of the Metacarpal Bones (fig. 53).—The meta- Metacai-pal carpal bones of the four fingers are connected at their bases j'^i^ed^y by the following ligaments :—A superficial dorsal and palmar their bases fasciculus of fibres passes transversely from one bone to the next ; and the bands in the palm are the strongest (fig. 51). Besides there is a short interosseous ligament between the contiguous rough surfaces of the bones. Lateral union.—Where the metacarpal bones touch they by side are covered by articular cartilage, and the surfaces are fur- nished with prolongations of the synovial membrane serving for their articulation with the carpus. At their anterior extremities the metacarpal bones are and by their bound together by the transverse ligament, which has been examined in the dissection of the hand (p. 327). * Posterior ligaments of the wrist, and the carpal and metacarpal bones (Bourgery and Jacob). 1.

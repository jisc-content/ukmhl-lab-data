The costo-vertehral ligament, which is also named stellate ^^fj'^J^- from its form (fig. 58, ^), is composed of radiating fibres, stellate. Fig. 58.* Where the ribs touch two vertebrae it consists of three sets of fibres :—The upper set, the largest, ascends to the body of the vertebra above the head of the rib ; the lower set descends to the vertebra below the head; and the central part is united with the fibro-cartilage between the vertebrae. Where the rib is in contact with the body of only one vertebra, as in the first, eleventh, and twelfth, the ligament differs in has but two sets of fibres. The chief fibres are fixed into the vertebra ; whilst an ascending band is attached to the body of the vertebra immediately above, and that from the first rib is continued to the last cervical vertebra. The interarticular ligament will be seen when the stellate inter- ligament is divided. It is a short thin band of fibro-car- articular, * Ligaments of the ribs and vertebrse (Bourgery).—1.

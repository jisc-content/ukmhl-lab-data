DISSECTION OF THE BACK. 438 other elevator muscles. Outer intercostal muscle. Dissection. Dorsal nerve has posterior and anterior branch. Intercostal artery. In some of the four lower muscles a few fibres are con- tinued beyond one rib to that next succeeding. These longer slips have been named hvatores longiores costarum. ^ The external intercostal muscle is continued backwards along the ribs as far as the tubercle, and is overlaid by the elevator muscle. Beneath the muscle are the intercostal nerve and artery. Dissection.â€”To trace the anterior and posterior primary branches of the dorsal nerves to their common trunk, the elevator of the rib and the external intercostal muscle are to be cut through in one or more spaces. The intercostal artery with its posterior branch is laid bare at the same time. The dorsal nerves can be now seen to split in the inter- vertebral foramina into anterior and posterior primary branches. * The posterior branches are directed backwards, internal to the anterior costo-transverse ligament, and have been already examined (p. 430). The anterior is named intercostal, and is continued between the ribs to the front of the chest. Its anatomy is learnt in the dissection of the thorax (p. 403). The intercostal artery has an almost exact corre- spondence with the dorsal nerve in its branching and distribution.

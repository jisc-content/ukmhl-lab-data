Fosition. —During the dissection of the front of the thigh the body shoukl lie on the back, with a block of a suitable size beneath the loins, and the lower limbs should hang over the end of the dissecting table. The limb is to be rotated outwards, so as to make evident a hollow at the upper part of the thigh ; and it is to be supported in a half bent posi- tion by means of a stool beneath the foot. Surface marking.—Before any of the integument is re- moved from the limb, the student is to observe the chief markings and eminences on the surface of the thigh. The limit between the thigh and the abdomen is marked in front by the firm band of Poupart's ligament intervening between the crest of the hip bone and the pubes. On the outer side the separation is indicated by the convexity of the iliac crest of the hip bone, which subsides behind in the sa- crum and coccyx. On the inner side is the projection of the pubes, from which a line of bone (pubic arch) may be traced backwards along the inner and iipper part of the limb to the ischial tuberosity. On the anterior aspect of the thigh, and close to Poupart's ligament, is a slight hollow, corresponding with the trian- gular space of Scarpa, in which the larger vessels of the limb are contained ; and extending thence obliquely along the inner side of the limb, is a slight depression marking the situation of the femoral artery beneath. The position of the arterial trunk may be ascertained by a line on the surface from the centre of the interval between the symphysis pubis and the crest of the hip bone, to the inner condyle of the

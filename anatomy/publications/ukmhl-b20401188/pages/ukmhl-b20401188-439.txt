THE FASCIA LUMBOEUM. 419 iliac crest; and by three or four fleshy processes from as many of the lower ribs, which digitate with pieces of the external oblique muscle of the abdomen. And between the outer and inner attachments it is inseparably blended below with the subjacent tendon of the multifidus spinse. All the fibres converge to the inferior angle of the scapula, and after insertion crossing that point of bone are continued forwards to be i^^gj-^g mserted, by means of a tendon, into the bottom of the bicipital groove of the humerus (p. 27V). The muscle is subcutaneous, except a small part of the Connec- upper border which is covered by the trapezius ; near the scapula there is a space between the two muscles, in which the ribs and the intercostal and rhomboid muscles are seen. The lower or anterior border overlays the edge of the external oblique abdominal muscle in the interval between the last rib and the iliac crest, except a small part below. Frequently the latissimus has a distinct fleshy slij) from the inferior angle of the scapula. * Dissection.—The latissimus is to be divided about mid- Dissection way between the spines of the vertebrae and the angle of i^Jg^g^^^us. the scapula, and the pieces are to be reflected inwards and outwards. In raising the inner part of the muscle, care must be taken not to destroy the thin lower serratus with which it is united, and the aponeurosis continued upwards from the serratus. In the interval between the last rib and the iliac crest the latissimus is adherent to the aponeurosis of the transversalis abdominis muscle, and should not be detached from it. * Farts covered by the latissimus.—The latissimus dorsi ^^J^^^^^ muscle lies on the erector spinse, on the serratus posticus by the inferior, and on the lower ribs with their intercostal muscles, l^^tissimus. As it rests on the angle of the scapula, it conceals the teres major, and a part of the rhomboid muscle. Its relation to the teres is worthy of note :—at the angle of the scapula it is in contact with the posterior surface of the teres, bufc nearer the humerus it turns round, and is inserted in front of that muscle. Between the angle of the scapula and the Forms humerus the latissimus forms part of the posterior boundary Sl*^^^ of the axilla. Dissection. —After the latissimus dorsi has been reflected, ^/|^g^-.^°^^ the dissector of the abdomen can look to the disposition of lumborum; the posterior tendon of the transversalis abdominis (fascia lumborum) between the last rib and the innominate bone. In the spot referred to are portions of the muscles left in the dissection of the wall of the abdomen. Firstly, a piece E E 2

Some areolar tissue must be taken away. Tendons of the flexor profundus. —At the lower border of Tendons the annular ligament the tendinous mass of the flexor pro- fle^^r^ fundus is divided into four pieces ; whilst in the forearm only the tendon of the fore finger is distinct from the rest. From the ligament the four tendons are directed through the cross the hand to the fingers. At the root of the fingers each enters ^^^^ the digital sheath with a tendon of the flexor sublimis (fig. 46, and having passed through that tendon, is inserted to their into the base of the last phalanx. insertion. Between both flexor tendons and the bones are small siiort folds membranous folds (ligamenta brevia), one for each. By flexor^en- means of this fold each tendon is connected with the fore ^^o^is. part of the phalanx, and the capsule of the joint, imme- diately behind the bone into which it is inserted."^ The lumbricales muscles (fig. 46,are four small fleshy Lumbrical slips that are connected with the tendons of the deep flexor, attached to They arise from the side of the tendons near the annular ^^^P flexor, ligament, and are directed to the radial side of the fingers, one for each, to be inserted into an aponeurotic expansion on the dorsal aspect of the first or metacarpal phalanx.

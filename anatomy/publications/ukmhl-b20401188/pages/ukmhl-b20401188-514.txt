DISSECTIOIT OF THE ABDOMEK 494 issues the front of the iliac crest, where it is connected with the riiig"^^^ preceding. The nerve afterwards pierces the internal oblique, to which it supplies branches, and coursing over that muscle, reaches the surface of the thigh through the external abdo- minal ring (p. 479). May be very This nerve may be so small as to end by joining the ilio- small. hypogastric branch. In such cases the ilio-hypogastric fur- nishes an offset which takes the usual place of the ilio- inguinal nerve, and corresponds in distribution with it. Dissection JJissection.—For the purpose of seeing the transversalis salis fascia, fascia, it will be necessary to raise, on the right side, the low^er part of the transversalis muscle by two incisions ;— one of these is to be carried through the fibres attached to Poupart's ligament ; the other, across the muscle from the front of the hip bone to the margin of the rectus. With a little care the muscle may be separated easily from the thin fascia beneath. Fascia The fascia transversalis is a thin fibrous layer between the ransversa is transversalis muscle and the peritoneum, which has been so is best named by Sir A. Cooper. In the groin or inguinal region the'^groinl^ (fig. 75, ), where it is unsupported by muscles, the fascia is considerably stronger than elsewhere, and is joined by fibres of the aponeurosis of the transversalis muscle ; but farther from the pelvis it gradually decreases in strength, until at the thorax it becomes an unimportant thin membrane. JSTearPou- In the part of the fascia now laid bare is an opening— mentisthe "^^^ internal abdominal ring, which gives passage to the ^ bd ^^^^ c 1 ^P®^^^^^^ cord, or the round ligament, according to the sex. Ting, ' On the inner side of that opening the fascia is thinner than on the outer side, and is fixed internally into the pubes and the pectineal line of the hip bone, behind the conjoined tendon with which it is united.

Situation of Internal abdominal ring (fig. 75).—The opening called abdominal internal abdominal ring is situate midway between the symphysis pubis and the anterior superior iliac spine, and half an inch above Poupart's ligament. From its margin a thin tubular prolongation of the fascia is continued around the cord.

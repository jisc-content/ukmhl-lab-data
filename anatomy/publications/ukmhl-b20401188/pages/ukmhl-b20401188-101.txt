BRANCHES OF THE CAROTID ARTERY. 85 which it makes a remarkable sigmoid turn. Its disposition supplies in the face has been examined (p. 28). The cervical part ^^^^^^ of the artery gives branches to the pharynx, and to the structures below the jaw, viz. :— a. The inferior palatine hranch ascends to the pharynx to the beneath the jaw, passing between the stylo-glossus and i^^^^^®' stylo-pharyngeus muscles; furnishing a branch to the tonsil, it is distributed to the soft palate. This branch frequently arises from the ascending pharyngeal artery. h. The tonsillar branch is smaller than the preceding, tonsil, and ascends between the internal pterygoid and stylo-glossus muscles. Opposite the tonsil it perforates the constrictor muscle, and ends in offsets to that body. c. Glandular branches are supplied to the submaxillary submaxii- gland from the part of the artery in contact with it. ^^^"^ giaud, d. The submental branch arises near the inferior maxilla, and mylo- and passes forwards on the mylo-hyoideus to the anterior ^y^^^ ■'^ . . . . muscle, belly of the digastric muscle, where it ends in branches : some of these turn over the jaw to the chin and lower lip ; and the rest supply the muscles between the jaw and the hyoid bone, one or two perforating the mylo-hyoideus and anastomosing with the sublingual artery. The facial vein (p. 29) joins the internal jugular vein. In Facial vein, the cervical part of its course it receives branches correspond- ing with the offsets of the artery. It often throws itself into the temporo-maxillary trunk. The occipital artery is of considerable size, and is destined Occipital for the back of the head. It arises from the carotid ^^^^^^ opposite the facial branch, and near the lower border of the digastric muscle. From this spot the artery ascends to the inner part of the mastoid process of the temporal bone ; next it turns horizontally backwards on the occipital bone, ends on passing above the transverse process of the atlas; and ^^^^^^^^^' finally becomes cutaneous near the middle line (p. 6). In in neck has the neck this artery passes beneath the digastric muscle and a part of the parotid gland ; and crosses over the internal carotid artery, the jugular vein, and the spinal accessory and hypoglossal nerves. The only offset from the artery in the front of the neck is the dura a small posterior meningeal branch to the dura mater in the posterior fossa of the base of the skull. This ascends along the internal jugular vein, and enters the skull by the foramen jugulare (p. 17). The branches at the back of the neck will be afterwards seen. The occipital vein begins at the back of the head (p. 6), Occipital

88 DISSECTION OF THE PTERYGOID REGIOK facial vessels and the facial nerve. The anterior border pro- jects over the buccinator muscle, and a quantity of fat lies on the resembling that in the orbit is found beneath it. The muscle ^^^* covers the ramus of the jaw, and the masseteric branches of nerve and artery entering it at the under surface. To see sur- Dissection. —To lay bare the temporal muscle to its inser- pOTaf^ ^^on, the following dissection may be made :—The temporal muscle. fascia is to be detached from the upper border of the zygo- matic arch, and removed from the surface of the muscle. Next, the arch is to be sawn through in front and behind, so as to include its whole length ; and to be thrown down (without being cut off) with the masseter muscle still attached to it, by separating the fibres of that muscle from the upper part of the ramus of the jaw. In detaching the masseter Fig, 11.^'' muscle, the nerve and artery to it, which appear through the sigmoid notch, will be found. The surface and insertion of the temporal muscle may be then cleaned. * Dissection of the pterygoid region (from Quain's Arteries). 1. Temporal muscle. 2. External pterygoid. 3. Internal pterygoid. 4. Buccinator. 5. Digastric and stylo-hyoid muscles cut and thrown back. 6. Common carotid dividing into external and internal trunks. 8. Internal maxillary artery (beneath the pterygoid) and its branches.

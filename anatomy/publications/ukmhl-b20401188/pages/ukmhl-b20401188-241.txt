225 mTERIOE OF THE CEREBRUM. wliicli has been cut through above the level of the convolu- ovale minus tion of the corpus callosum, the surface displays a white sphere, central mass of an oval shape, the centrum ovale minus, which sends processes into the several convolutions. In a fresh brain this surface is studded with drops of blood which escape from the divided vessels. When the hemispheres have been sliced off to the level of ^^^^^g^-^g the corpus callosum a much larger white surface comes into is^deeperl^^ view, which has been named larger oval centre—centrum ovale, Vieussens. The white mass in each hemisphere may be further seen to be continuous across the middle line of the brain, where it is connected by a narrowed part,—the corpus callosum. The corpus callosum reaches from the one half of the ^^J^^^ cerebrum to the other, and forms the roof of a space (lateral ventricle) in each hemisphere ; but between the halves of the brain, where it occupies the longitudinal fissure, this body is of less extent. Here it is about four inches in Situation length, and somewhat arched from before backwards ; it is and form, also narrower in front than behind, and extends nearer to the anterior than the posterior part of the cerebrum. On the upper surface the fibres are directed from the Upper sur- hemispheres to the middle line,—the middle ones being transverse, but those from the anterior and posterior parts oblique. Along the centre is a mark or raphe, and close ^^^g^^^^J to it are two or more longitudinal white lines (nerves of longitudinal Lancisi). Still further out may be seen other longitudinal ^^^e-^- lines (covered band, p. 223) beneath the convolution resting on the lateral part of the corpus callosum. The longitudinal fibres in the middle line are continued downwards in front, and joining a prolongation from the covered band or fillet on the side, are continued to the anterior perforated spot. In front the corpus callosum is bent to the base of the p^*®^^^^jg brain (fig. 37, a), as before described (p. 221) ; and behind down, it ends in a thick roll (6), which is connected with the sub- jacent fornix (/). Dissection.—In order to see the thickness of the corpus Dissection, callosum, and to bring into view the parts in contact with its under surface, the cut already made through that body into the ventricle is to be extended forwards and backwards on the left side, as far as the limits of the cavity. Whilst cutting through the corpus callosum, the student may ob- serve that a thin membraniform structure lines its under surface. The corpus callosum is thicker at each end than at the is thickest at each end. Q

705 CTJTAITEOtJS NERVES. From the posterior hrmicJies of the lumbar and sacral From lum- nerves.—The offsets of the posterior primary branches of the lumbar nerves are two or three in number, and cross the crest of the hip bone near the anterior edge of the erector spinse : they ramify in the integuments covering the gluteus muscle, and some branches may be traced nearly to the tro- chanter major. The branches of the sacral nerves perforate the gluteus and sacral maximus near the origin, and are then directed outwards for a short distance in the integuments over the muscle. These offsets are usually three in number; the largest is opposite the lower end of the sacrum, another is near the iliac crest, and the other by the side of the coccyx. Nerves from the lumbar plexus.'—Parts of two nerves from From lum- the lumbar plexus, viz. ilio-hypogastric and external cuta- ^^r plexus, neous, are spent in the integuments of this region. a. The iliac branch of the ilio-hypogastric nerve crosses ^JjJ^-^^p^ the iliac crest in front of the branches from the lumbar gastric, and nerves, and extends only a short distance below the crest : this branch is very variable in size, or it may be wanting. b. Offsets of the external cutaneous nerve of the thigh ^^J^^^^J^g bend backwards to the integuments above the great tro- chanter, and cross the ramifications of the branch of the last dorsal nerve. Nerves from the sacral lolexus.—Only one nerve of the From sacral plexus, viz. the small sciatic, sends superficial branches to the ^^^^^^^^ buttock. Its cutaneous offsets appear along the lower border small^ of the gluteus maximus, and are accompanied by superficial branches of the sciatic artery ; two or three ascend round the edge of the muscle, and are lost in the integuments over the lower part; the remaining branches descend to the thigh, and will be afterwards noticed on it. The last dorsal nerve supplies the buttock by means of its From last lateral cutaneous branch (p. 479). This offset perforates the ^q^^^I muscles of the abdomen, and crosses the anterior part of the ihac crest to be distributed over the fore part of the gluteal region, as low as the great trochanter. Dissection.—In the examination of this region the thin Clean and unimportant deep fascia may be disregarded, in order maximus. that the great gluteal muscle, which is the most difficult in the body to make clean, may be well displayed. Supposing the student desirous to lay bare the muscle at once, let him turn aside the cutaneous nerves, and draw away and rotate inwards the limb to make tense the muscular fibres.

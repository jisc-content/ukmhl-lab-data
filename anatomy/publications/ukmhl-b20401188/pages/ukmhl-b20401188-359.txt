The internal lateral ligament is smaller than the external, internal but is longer than it. It is attached by one end to the sty- lateral, loid process of the ulna, and by the other to the rough, * Front view of the articulations of the wrist joint, and of the carpal and metacarpal bones (Bourgery and Jacob).—1.

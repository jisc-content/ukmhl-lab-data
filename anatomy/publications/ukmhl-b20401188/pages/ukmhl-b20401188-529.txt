509 FEMOKAL HERNIA. Poupart's ligament, with, the sheath to which they give origin ; and lastly, the crural ring, or the space through which the hernia leaves the abdomen. The subperitoneal fat extends as a continuous layer be- Subperi- neath the peritoneum, but it is thickest and most fibrous at the lower part of the abdomen where the vessels pass under Poupart's ligament. At that spot it extends over the upper opening of the sheath of the vessels, instead of descending in it around the vessels ; and internal to the vein, it covers a space named crural ring, as well as a lymph- atic gland which occupies that space. The piece of the forms sep- layer that stretches over the crural ring is named by crural M. Cloquet septum crurale; and it is described by him as being concave towards the abdomen, and convex towards the thigh. An inguinal gland is generally attached to its under surface. The fascia transversalis (fig. 76, has been before Fascia described (p. 494).

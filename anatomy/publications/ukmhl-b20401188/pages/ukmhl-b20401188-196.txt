Directions. —On the part of the spinal column that was laid aside after the separation of the pharynx from it, the student is to dissect the deep muscles on the front of the vertebrge. Dissection.—To dissect the prevertebral muscles, it will be necessary to remove the areolar tissue. The muscles are three in number on each side, and are easily distinguished. The largest one, nearest the middle line, is the longus colli ; the muscle external to this, which reaches to the head, is the rectus capitis anticus major ; and the small muscle, external to the last and close to the skull, the rectus capitis anticus minor. The smaller rectus muscle is often injured in cutting through the basilar process of the occipital bone. The LOJ^GUS COLLI MUSCLE (fig. 23, ^ and') is situate on the bodies of the cervical and upper dorsal vertebrse, and is pointed above, but larger Fig, SS."' below. It consists of two parts—internal and exter- nal, the former being ver- tical, and the latter oblique in direction. The internal part, 7, arises by fleshy and tendinous processes from the bodies of the two upper dorsal, and two lower cer- vical vertebrse; and the ex- ternal piece, 6, takes origin from the upper border of the anterior transverse pro- cesses (parapophyses) of four cervical vertebrse (sixth, fifth, fourth, and third). Both parts of the muscle are blended above, and the whole is inserted by four slips into the lower border of the bodies of the four upper cervical vertebrse.

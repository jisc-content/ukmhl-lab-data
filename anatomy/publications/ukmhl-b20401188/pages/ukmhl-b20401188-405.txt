PNEUMO-GASTRIC NERYE. 385 clavian artery and the right innominate vein, and sends backwards a recurrent branch round the former. At first it is directed obliquely backwards, over the side of the trachea, to the interval between that tube and the oesophagus; and thus supported, the nerve reaches the posterior aspect of the root of the lung, where it forms the posterior pulmonary plexus. From the plexus two large offsets are continued to ^ack^of t^e the oesophagus, and unite into one near the diaphragm: the oesophagus trunk thus reconstituted, lies behind the gullet, and passes along it to the posterior surface of the stomach. The left nerve enters the thorax behind the left innominate Left nervo vein, and to the outer side of the left common carotid artery. rooTo/the Lying between the left subclavian and common carotid lung, arteries, the nerve courses over the arch of the aorta, then beneath the root of the lung, and forms there a larger plexus than on the right side. From the pulmonic plexus one or J^'^^^ ^^^^^^jf^ two branches pass to the front of the oesophagus, and join oesophagus, with corresponding branches of the right nerve in a plexus on that tube. Finally, the divisions of the nerve are col- lected into one trunk, which is continued on the front of the oesophagus to the anterior part of the stomach. Tlje branches of the pneumo-gastric nerve in the thorax Branches are the following:— 1. The recurrent or inferior laryngeal nerve is the first recurrent branch in the thorax. Arising on the right side on a level inTh^^"^ with the subclavian artery, and on the left at the lower t^^^'^^- border of the arch of the aorta, the nerve bends backwards to the trachea, along which it ascends to the larynx. On each side this branch is freely connected with the cervical cardiac branches of the sympathetic nerve, especially on the left side beneath the arch of the aorta. 2. Cardiac branches (thoracic). — Besides the cardiac Cardiac branches furnished by the vagus in the neck, there are other the^horax* ofisets in front of the trachea to communicate with the cardiac plexus. These branches come from the trunk and the recurrent branch of the nerve on the right side, but they are supplied by the recurrent nerve alone on the left side. The termination of the lower cervical cardiac branch of lower car- each vagus nerve (p. 118) may be now seen. The branch orthe^'^^^^ of the right vagus lies by the side of the innominate artery, and joins a cardiac nerve of the sympathetic from the neck; whilst the branch of the left vagus crosses over the arch of the aorta, and ends in the superficial cardiac plexus. 3. Pulmonary branches. —There are two sets of branches Pulmonary „ „ branches.

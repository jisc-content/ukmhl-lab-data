367 CAVITY OF THE RIGHT YENTRICLE. superior cava, flows downwards in front of the other to the right ventricle. Dissection.—Seizing the loose part of the right ventricle, Toopen the student should pass the scalpel through it below the ^^^.^^.^^1^ opening from the auricle, and cutting downwards bring it out inferiorly near the apex of the heart without injuring the septum ventriculorum. A flap is thus formed, like the letter Y, of the anterior part of the ventricle. In the examination of the cavity of the right ventricle, both the flap and the apex of the heart should be raised with hooks, so that the space may be looked into from below. The CAVITY OF THE RIGHT VENTRICLE is triangular in form, Cavity of and has the base turned upwards to the auricle of the same v^tricle. side. On a cross section the cavity would appear semilunar in shape, with the septum between the ventricles convex towards the cavity. The apex of the cavity reaches the right border of the Apex, heart at a little distance from the tip. The base of the Base and its ventricle is sloped, and is perforated by two apertures ; one '^P^^^^^®- of these, on the right, leading into the auricle, is the right auriculo-ventricular opening ; the other on the left, and much higher, is the mouth of the pulmonary artery. The part of the cavity which compaunicates with the pulmonary artery is funnel-shaped, and is named infundibulum, or conus arteriosus. The anterior wall, or the loose part of the ventricle, is Anterior comparatively thin, and forms most of the anterior surface of the ventricular portion of the heart. The posterior vjall posterior corresponds in greatest part with the septum between the ventricles, and is of considerable thickness. Over the greater part of the cavity the surface is irregular, and is marked by projecting fleshy bands of muscular fibres, unevenl*^ the columnse carneae, but near the aperture of the pulmonary artery the wall becomes smooth. The fleshy columns are of various sizes, and of three dijfferent kinds. Some form On it there merely a prominence in the ventricle, as on the septum, sets*^'^*^^ Others are attached at each.end, but free in the ^of^^^s (trabeculse carneae). And a third set, which are fewer in number and much the largest, project into the cavity, and form rounded bundles, named musculi papillares; these give attachment by their free ends to the little tendinous cords of the valve of the auriculo-ventricular opening. The auriculo-ventricular orifice is situate in the base of Opening the ventricle, near the right or free border of the heart, and aurTcle^-^ is opposite the centre of the sternum, between the third

The ilio-hypogastric branch (fig. 91, ^) is derived from the first nerve, and appears at the outer border of the psoas muscle, near the upper part : it and the following branch are cutaneous nerves of the buttock and lower part of the trunk. The nerve is directed over the quadratus lumborum to the iliac crest, and enters the wall of the abdomen by penetrating \'h.e transversalis abdominis. Its termination in the integuments of the buttock and ab- domen, by means of an iliac and hypo- gastric branch, has been already men- tioned (p. 479). The ilio-inguinal branch (") arises with the preceding from the first nerve, and issues from the psoas nearly at the same spot. Of smaller size than the ilio-hy- pogastric, this branch courses outwards over the quadratus and iliacus muscles to- wards the front of the crest of the hip bone, where it pierces the transversalis ab- dominis. The farther course of the nerve in the abdominal wall, and its distri- bution over the scro- tum and the groia, are before noticed (pp. 479, 493). The size of this nerve depends upon that of the ilio- hypogastric branch ; and the nerve may be absent if the latter is large. * The lumbar plexus and branches (Schmidt).â€”a. Twelfth rib. 5.

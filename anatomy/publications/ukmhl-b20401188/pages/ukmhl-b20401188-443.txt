423 THIRD LAYER OF MUSCLES. Tlie veins have tlie same names and course as the arteries Accompany- above described ; they open into the external jugular vein near its junction with the subclavian vein. Nerve to the rhomhoid muscles.—This slender nerve of the Nerve of brachial plexus (p. 77) takes the course of the preceding muscle?*^ artery beneath the elevator of the angle of the scapula. Before its termination it supplies one or two twigs to the elevator of the scapula ; it is lost in the rhomboidei, on the under surface. Dissection.—By reflecting the rhomboidei muscles Dissection, towards the spinous processes, and removing the loose areolar tissue, the thin upper serratus muscle which is beneath them will be laid bare. Third Layer .—In this stratum are the following Third layer ^ ,^ , . 1 ' o ' -.1 of muscles. muscles :—the serratus posticus superior and inferior, with the splenius. ''^ The SERRATi muscles are very thin, and receive their p^^'^^^^i '^^^ ' . two lU name from their toothed attachment to the ribs. They are number, two in number, superior and inferior, and have aponeurotic origins from the spines of the vertebrae. The serratus posticus superior arises from the ligamentum Smaller one nuchse, and from the spinous processes of the last cervical, part^of the and two or three upper dorsal vertebrae. The fleshy fibres thorax, are inclined downwards, and are attached by slips to the second, third, and fourth ribs, external to their angles. The muscle rests on the splenius. The serratus posticus inferior (fig. 66, ^) occupies the Larger lumbar region, and is wider than the preceding muscle. Its JJ^er part aponeurosis of origin is inseparably united with that of the of thorax, latissimus dorsi and the fascia lumborum, and is connected to the spinous processes of the last two dorsal and first three lumbar vertebrae. The fleshy fibres ascend to be inserted by oflsets into the last four ribs in front of their angles, each successive process extending further forwards than the one below. This muscle lies on the mass of the erector spinse, ^^^JJg^°' and with it the vertebral aponeurosis is united. The vertebral aponeurosis is a fibrous expansion, which Vertebral is spread over the fourth layer of muscles, and confines the ^p^^®^'^^^^^' erector spinse in the hollow by the side of the spinous pro- ^g^^ts?" cesses. Inferiorly it is thickened by the tendons of the latissimus and lower serratus ; but it is continued above beneath the splenius, without joining the upper serratus, and blends with the deep fascia of the neck. Internally it is attached to the spinous processes. Externally it is con- nected to the posterior tliird of the iliac crest, blending with

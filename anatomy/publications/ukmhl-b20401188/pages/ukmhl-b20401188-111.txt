INFERIOR MAXILLARY NERYE. 95 to the buccinator muscle and the side of the face, on which it joins the branches of the facial artery. 6. The pterygoid branches are uncertain in their position ; to pterygoid whether derived from the trunk or some of the branches of ^^^scies. the internal maxillary, they enter the pterygoid muscles. Of the branches that arise from the artery when it is Branches of about to enter, or has entered the spheno-maxillary fossa, oniy^one^ only one, the superior dental, will be now described. The i^ow seen, remainder will be examined with the superior maxillary nerve and Meckel's ganglion ; they are infraorbital (p. 108), and superior palatine, ^Dterygo-palatine, spheno-palatine, and vidian, (Section 14). 7. The superior or posterior dental branch arises near the Superior upper maxillary bone, and descends to the teeth with a tortuous course on the outer surface of that bone, along with a small branch of the superior maxillary nerve. For the most part its offsets enter the foramina in the bone, and supply the upper molar and bicuspid teeth, but some are furnished to the gums. A few branches reach the lining membrane of the antrum. The INTERNAL MAXILLARY VEIN receives the veins that internal accompany the branches of the artery in the first two parts ^^J^^^^^^ of its course. The veins of this region form a plexus— begins in pterygoid, between the two pterygoid muscles, and in part rygoid)/^^^* between the temporal and external pterygoid muscles. This plexus communicates with the alveolar plexus and the facial vein by a large branch (anterior internal maxillary) ; and with the cavernous sinus in the interior of the skull, by means of branches that pass through apertures in the base of the cranium. Escaping from the plexus, the vein accom- and ends in panics the artery to the parotid gland, and there joins the J^g^J^r ^ superficial temporal vein,—the union of the two giving rise to a vessel that enters either the external or the internal jugular vein (p. 31). The INFERIOR MAXILLARY NERVE is the largest of the inferior three trunks arising from the Gasserian ganglion (p. 19), ^^rve^^^^ and resembles a spinal nerve in possessing fibrils that confer both motory and sensory properties on the parts to which they are distributed. The nerve leaves the skull by the consists of a foramen ovale in the sphenoid bone, and divides into two ™nsory^^ chief pieces beneath the external pterygoid muscle ; viz. an P^^^*. anterior, small, or muscular part; and a large, posterior, or sensory part.

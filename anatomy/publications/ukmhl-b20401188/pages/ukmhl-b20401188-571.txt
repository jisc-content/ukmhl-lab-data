GLANDS OF THE SMALL INTESTINE. 551 A patcli, when examined by the microscope, appears to Composition be but a collection of the solitary glands, for it consists of a ^^^^^^"^^^ Fi?. 8-2.* number of small flattened vesicles or sacs, which are round or oval in form, and are covered by the mucous membrane. Like the glands referred to, the vesicles contain a whitish ^f^^ ^® f^^^ ° ' of the soli- consistent fluid, and are commonly without any aperture, tary glands, though they have been found with openings into the intes- tine (Thomson). Around the vesicles is a ring of apertures of the crypts before described. The mucous membrane over them is a little hollowed, and may in some instances be furnished with villi. Between the vesicles the lining membrane of the bowel lias the same appearance as in other parts. Glands of Brunner.—Directions have been already given Compound how to display these glands (p. 548). They are small com- Bmnner's; pound glands, similar to the buccal and labial glands of the mouth, which exist only in the duodenum. Near the pylorus they are most numerous, and there they are visible without a lens, being nearly as large as hemp seed. When examined compo- more minutely the glands are found to consist of lobules, with appertaining little excretory tubes ; and each ends on ^^^^^F^^ the surface of the mucous membrane by a duct, whose aper- ducts. ^ * A magnified view of a piece of mucous membrane covered with its villi and tubules (Boehm). On the left hand is a piece of one of Peyer's patches or glands, representing the vesicles of tlie glands, each having a ring of tubes at its circumference, and being destitute of villi.

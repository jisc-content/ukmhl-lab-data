SCALEXI MUSCLES. 69 Directions.—The remaining parts included in this section are the scaleni muscles and the subclavian blood-vessels, with the cervical nerves and the carotid blood-vessels. The student may examine them in the order here given. Dissection.—Supposing the sterno-mastoid to be cut, the Dissection fat and fascia are to be taken away from the lower part of ^fj^^;^^^^^^^^' the neck, so as to prepare the scaleni muscles with the artery subclavian vessels and their branches. By means of a little dissection the anterior scalenus muscle will be seen ascending from the first rib to the neck, having the phrenic nerve and subclavian vein in front of it, the latter crossing it near the rib. The part of the subclavian artery that is on the inner side of the scalenus is then to be cleaned, care being taken not only of its branches, but of the branches of the sympa- thetic nerve which course from the neck to the chest. This dissection will be facilitated by the removal of a part or the whole of the clavicle. All the branches of the artery are in and general easily found, except the superior intercostal, which ^^^^^^iies. is to be sought in the thorax in front of the neck of the first rib. On the branch (inferior thyroid) ascending to the thyroid body, or near it, is the middle cervical ganglion of the sympathetic, and the dissector should follow downwards from it the small nerves to the thorax. Only the origin and first part of the course of the arterial branches can be now seen ; their termination is met with in other stages of this dissection, or in the dissection of the other parts of the body. In this stage the student should seek the small right lymphatic duct that opens into the subclavian vein Of lympha- near its junction with the jugular. A notice of it will be given with the lymphatics of the thorax. The outer part of the subclavian artery having been Dissection already prepared, let the dissector remove more completely piex^^s^^^^^ the fibrous tissue from the nerves of the cervical and brachial plexuses. From the brachial plexus trace the small branch to the subclavius muscle, and the branches to the rhomboid and serratus muscles which pierce the middle scalenus. If it is thought necessary, the anterior scalenus may be cut through after the artery has been studied. From the cervical plexus, besides muscular branches, the Dissection student should seek small twigs to join the descendens noni; piel^s^^^^ and should define the roots of the phrenic nerve. Lastly, let the surface of the middle scalenus muscle be cleaned, as it lies beneath the cervical nerves. The SCALENI muscles are usually described as three in Number of number, and are named from their relative position, anterior, mus^c^es.

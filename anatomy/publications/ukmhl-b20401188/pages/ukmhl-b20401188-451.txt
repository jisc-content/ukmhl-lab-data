431 VESSELS m THE BACK. The internal branches decrease in size from above down- luner wards. The upper six are directed inwards between the ^^Tpefslx*^^ semispinalis dorsi and multifidus spinse muscles, and become iiave cuta- cutaneous along the side of the spinous processes by per- sets?^ forating the rhomboideus and trapezius muscles. Offsets are supplied to the muscles between which they are placed. The lower six are small in size, and end in the multifidus Lower six spinae muscle. ■^^ In the loins.—The posterior primary branches of the Lumbar lumbar nerves are five in number, and appear between the ^f^^g^^j^^^^-^j erector and multifidus spinse. In their mode of dividing two. and general arrangement they resemble the dorsal nerves. Cutaneous offsets are furnished only by the external set of branches. The external branches enter the fibres of the erector External spinse, and supply it and the small intertransverse muscles. ^[^e^cJfta- The first three pierce the erector spinse, and become cuta- neous from neous after perforating the aponeurosis of the latissimus. The outer branch of the last nerve is connected with the corresponding part of the first sacral nerve by an offset which lies near the bones. * The internal branches are supplied to the multifidus internal spinse muscle. Near their origin they are difficult to find, endTn the in consequence of being contained in grooves close to the muscles, articular processes of the neural arches. Vessels m the back. —The vessels now dissected are The vessels the occipital and the deep cervical artery ; part of the ver- tebral artery ; and the posterior branches of the intercostal and lumbar arteries of the aorta. Veins accompany the arteries for the most part. In the neck.—The vessels in the neck are the occipital, in the neck, the vertebral, and the deep cervical. The occipital artery courses along the occipital bone. Ap- Part of the pearing from beneath the digastric muscle, the vessel is artery directed backwards beneath the sterno-mastoideus, the sple- nius, and sometimes the trachelo-mastoideus, but over the obliquus superior and complexus muscles. jN"ear the middle line of the body it perforates the trapezius and ascends to the occiput, on which it is distributed (p. 6). It sup- phes the surrounding muscles, and furnishes the following which branch to the neck :— ^^^"'^ a. The cervical branch (r. princeps cervicalis) distributes cervical twigs to the under part of the trapezius, and passing beneath ^^^'^^^h.

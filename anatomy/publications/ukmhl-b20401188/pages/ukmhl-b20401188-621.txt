601 LUMBAR ARTERIES AND VEINS. and a cutaneous branch (p. 479). Near the spine it fur- nishes a, small branch to the quadratus muscle ; and it may communicate by means of this with the first lumbar nerve. An offset from the first lumbar artery accompanies the nerve. The LUMBAR ARTERIES are parietal branches of the aorta Lumbar (p. 589), and are furnished to the spinal canal and the wall lve in num- of the abdomen : they resemble the aortic intercostals in ^^^^^^ their course and distribution. Commonly four in number on each side, these arteries arise opposite the centre of the vertebrse, and the vessels of opposite sides are sometimes joined in a common trunk ; they then pass backwards along Course the fore part of the vertebrse, beneath the pillar of the diaphragm and the psoas, to reach the intervals between the and termi- transverse processes, where each ends in an abdominal and a ^^^^^^ dorsal branch. The arteries of the right side lie beneath the vena cava. a. The dorsal hranch continues onwards to the back J'^]^^^^^^ between the transverse processes, and supplies an offset to ' the spinal canal. The distribution of the artery is described with the vessels of the back and spinal cord (pp. 432, 446). h. The abdominal branches are directed outwards beneath ^^^^^^^^^ the quadratus lumborum, the first being the largest, and the wall of enter the posterior part of the abdominal wall, where they ^g^f anastomose with the lower intercostal, the circumflex iliac, and the ilio-lumbar arteries : these branches supply the psoas and quadratus muscles. The branch of the first, and sometimes of the last artery, is superficial to the quadratus ; and the size of the last two varies with that of the ilio- lumbar offset of the internal iliac artery. The LUMBAR VEINS are the same in number, and have The veins re- the same course as the arteries. Commencing by the union arteries^^^ of a dorsal and an abdominal branch at the root of the transverse process, the trunk of the vein is directed forwards with the artery to the vena cava. They open into the pos- terior part of the cava, either singly, or conjointly with cava; those of the opposite side. On the left side the veins are left longest, longer than on the right, and pass beneath the aorta. Around the transverse processes, and beneath the psoas ^^^^^^^^^^^ muscle, the lumbar veins communicate freely with one transverse another, with the ilio-lumbar, and sometimes with the com- Processes, mon iliac, so as to form a plexus of veins. Issuing from the plexus on each side is a venous trunk, the ascending lumbar vein, which joins the azygos vein of the correspond- ing half of the body.

239 FIBRES OF THE CEREBKUM. under part of the optic thalamus, though some pass through both corpus striatum and optic thalamus. In those two ganglionic bodies the fibres are greatly increased in number; and in the optic thalamus, they receive accessory bundles their acces- from the superior peduncle of the cerebellum (p. 245), from sory bands. the fillet of the olivary body, from the pair of the corpora Fig. 38.* quadrigemina on the same side, and from the corpora geniculata. On escaping from the striate body and the thalamus the in the hemi- fibres radiate into the anterior, middle, and posterior parts gj^endto^^ of the cerebral hemisphere, forming the corona radiata. In convolu- the hemisphere the fibres are continued to the convolutions, but before reaching the circumference of the brain they decussate with the converging fibres of the corpus callosum. Their expansion in the hemisphere resembles a fan bent * Upper view of the peduncular fibres (Arnold), a. Fasciculus teres. h.

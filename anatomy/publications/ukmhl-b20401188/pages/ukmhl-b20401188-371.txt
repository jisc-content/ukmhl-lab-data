CHAPTEE IV. DISSECTION OF THE THORAX. Section I. CAVITY OF THE THORAX. The cavity of tlie thorax is the space included by the spinal Definition, column, the ribs, and the sternum, and by certain muscles in the intervals between the pieces of the bony framework. In it the organs of respiration, and the heart with its great Contents, vessels are lodged ; and through it the gullet, and some vessels and nerves are transmitted. Dissection.—When the parts covering in front the bony Dissection to parietes of the thorax have been examined and taken away, open thorax, the cavity is to be opened by removing a part of the anterior boundary. To make a sufficient opening into the thorax, the sternum is to be sawn through opposite the interval between the first two ribs, and again between the inser- tion of the cartilages of the fifth and sixth ribs. After detaching the lining membrane (pleura) from the inner sur- face of the chest, the student is to cut through all the true ribs, except the first and seventh"^, as far back as he can conveniently reach. The loose sternum and the ribs can be removed by dividing the intercostal muscles in the first and sixth spaces. The internal mammary artery may be cut across, and the bag of the pleura opened : when this has been done the cavity with its contents will be ready for examination. The sternum and the cartilages of the ribs will be required hereafter for the dissection of the ligaments. Form.—The cavity is of the same general form as the Form in thorax, that is to say, irregularly conical, with the apex ^ * The student must be mindful to leave those ribs uncut. The divi- sion of them will not be advantageous to his own part, and will injure the dissection of the neck and abdomen.

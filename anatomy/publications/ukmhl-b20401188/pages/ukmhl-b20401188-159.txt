MEATUSES OF THE ITOSE. 143 about half way from roof to floor, whilst the others extend the whole depth. Altogether in front of the bones, the lateral cartilages may be said to construct part of this boun- dary. On this wall are three convoluted osseous pieces, is irregular named spongy or turbinate hones (fig. 15), which project into ^^^.^^^^^^^' the cavity :â€”the two upper, 5 and 6, are processes of the spongy ^ ethmoid, but the lower one is a separate bone, viz. the ^^nes; inferior spongy. The spongy bones are confined to a certain portion of the outer wall, and their extent would be limited by a line continued nearly vertically upwards to the roof of the cavity from both the front and back of the floor. Be- presents tween each turbinate bone and the wall of the nose is a follows. Fig. 1 longitudinal hollow or meatus ; and into these hollows the nasal duct and the sinuses of the surrounding bones open. The meatuses are the spaces arched over by the spongy Meatuses, bones ; and as the bones are limited to a certain part of the outer wall, so are the spaces determined by them. The upper one (fig. 15) is the smallest and straightest of Upper the three meatuses, and equals in length about the posterior ^^^el^j^J^s two thirds of the space included by the vertical lines before * Spongy "bones and meatuses of the nasal cavity. 5. Upper spongy bone. 6. Middle spongy bone. 7. Inferior spongy bone. The three meatuses are the spaces beneath the spongy bones. Above the upper spongy bone is the fourth or rudimentary meatus. 8. Opening of the Eustachian tube. The woodcut shows also the glands of the nose.

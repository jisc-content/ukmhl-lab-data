DISSECTIOISr OF THE LAKYra. acting on the ligaments, and thereby elongating and shorten- ing the sides. The base is enlarged, and the interval rendered triangular by the posterior crico-arytsenoid ; and is diminished by the arytsenoid, and the lateral crico- arytsenoid. And the ligamentous sides are elongated and made tense by the crico-thyroid, but are shortened by the thyro-arytsenoid. In inspiration the fissure is slightly larger than in expiration. The 'ventricle of the larynx (fig. 22, v) is the oval hollow, on each side, between the vocal cords. The upper margin Fig. 22.* of the opening is semilunar, and the lower is straight. On the outer surface are the fibres of the thyro-arytsenoid muscle, and in the anterior part is the aperture into the laryngeal pouch. * Interior of the larynx with the vocal cords (Hilton), e, epiglottis; a, arytsenoid cartilage ; thyroid, and c, crycoid cartilage : h, de- pressor of the epiglottis; r, lower or true vocal cord ; ventricle of the larynx, with the false vocal cord above it; s, laryngeal pouch.

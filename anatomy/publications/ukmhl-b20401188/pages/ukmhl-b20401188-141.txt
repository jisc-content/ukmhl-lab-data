LEFT SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY. 125 thence over the first rib in its course to the upper limb. With this difference on the two sides in the origin of the differs much subclavian,—the one vessel beginning opposite the sterno- g^^t^ci^^f^n clavicular articulation, the other in the thorax,—it is evident that the length and connections of the part of the artery on the inner side of the scalenus must vary much on opposite sides. First part—The part of the artery internal to the ante- in the first rior scalenus is much longer on the left than the right side, ^^^^^^ and is almost vertical in direction, instead of being horizon- tal like its fellow. Moreover, after it leaves the chest it is deeply placed in the neck, near the spine and the oesophagus, and does not rise so high above the first rib as the right subclavian. Between the artery and the surface are the Connections same parts as are superficial to the right vessel, viz. the rounding common teguments and deep fascia, with the sterno-mastoid, P^-^ts. hyoid, and thyroid muscles. Behind the vessel is the longus colli muscle, with the inferior ganglion of the sym- pathetic. To the inner side are the oesophagus and the thoracic duct; and the pleura is in contact with the anterior and outer parts. Its connections lower in the chest are described in the dissection of the thorax. The pneumo-gastric nerve is in connection with this part Position of of the artery, but its position is parallel to the vessel instead ^^^^^ of across it as on the right side. The internal jugular vein, and internal in like manner, is parallel to the artery for a short distance, {o^t^^'^ and superficial to it. Accompanying also the subclavian artery are the cardiac branches of the sympathetic, which course along the side of the vessel to the chest. The second and third parts of the artery, viz. beneath and Rest of the beyond the scalenus, are nearly the same as on the right side ; but the student must note for himself the variations that may exist in the connections. The branches of this artery resemble so closely those of Branches the right trunk, that one description will serve for both, ^ho^e^of^ It may be remarked, that the superior intercostal of the left ligiit vessel, side is usually internal to, instead of beneath the scalenus ; in other words, this branch arises sooner (see p. 73). The thoracic duct conveys the chyle and lymph of Thoracic the greater part of the body into the venous circulation. ^^^^ Escaping from the thorax between the subclavian artery and comes from the oesophagus, the duct ascends in the neck as high as the ^^^^^^^ seventh or sixth cervical vertebra. At the spot mentioned as its highest extent, the duct arches outwards above the subclavian artery, and in front of the scalenus muscle and

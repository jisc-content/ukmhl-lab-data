DISSECTION OF THE THORAX. 398 and beneath tlie arch. At tlie upper part of tlie thorax the oesophagus ^' will be found to rest on the longus colli muscle and the vertebrae ; but below the arch of the aorta it is separated from the spine by the intercostal vessels ; and lastly it lies on the aorta. Below the situation of the bronchus the pneumo-gastric nerves surround the oesophagus with their branches, and above the same spot the thoracic duct will be found on its left. Three coats Structure.—If a piece of the middle of the gullet be are m it. removed and distended with cotton wool, it will be found to consist of a muscular, a fibrous, and a mucous coat. A muscular The muscular coat is thick and strong, and consists of coat of j^^Q layers of fibres ; of which the external is longitudinal, and the internal circular in direction, like the muscular tunic of the other parts of the alimentary tube. In the upper third of the oesophagus the fibres are red, and have voluntary the striated or voluntary muscular fibres mixed with the tary fibres, involuntary ; but below this the striated fibres gradually disappear, the colour becoming paler with their absence, and only involuntary muscular fibres remain. k>n*ltudinal external layer is formed of parallel longitudinal fibres, which form an entire covering, and end below on the stomach. The fibres begin by longitudinal bands opposite the cricoid cartilage Cp. 138) ; and at intervals varying from half an inch to an inch and a half, they are connected with tendinous points (-^th to -YQth. of an inch long, and y-'^th wide) like the fibres of the rectus abdominis muscle, circuia?™^^ interna? layer of circular fibres is continuous above fibres. with the fibres of the pharynx ; they are more oblique at the middle than at either end of the oesophagus. coat°^^^ The fibrous layer is between the muscular and mucous coats, and attaches the one to the other loosely. Mucous The mucous coat or lining will be seen on cutting open coat. ^-j^^ tube to be reddish in colour above bu.t pale below, and to have some thickness. It is very loosely connected with the muscular coat, and is thrown into longitudinal folds Epithelium "^-^^^ oesophagus is contracted. Lining the interior is and papillae, a thick layer of scaly epithelium ; and the surface is studded with minute papillae. Some Some compound glands (oesophageal) are scattered along glands. ^1^^ ^^-^^ . ^-^^ lower part of the gullet they form a ring (cardiac glands) close to the stomach. In the Lymphatics of the Thorax.—In the thorax are the thorax, i • i lymphatic lymphatic vessels of both the wall and the viscera, which

DISSECTION OF THE UPPER LIMB. 282 part of the clavicle. A capsular ligament, connecting the outer end of the clavicle with the acromion, will be seen by taking away the fibres of the trapezius and deltoid and scapula, muscles. Another strong band (coraco-acromial) passes transversely between the acromion and the coracoid pro- cess ; and lastly a small fasciculus (posterior proper ligament) is placed over the notch in the superior costa. Union of the LiGAMENTS OF THE ClAVICLE A^D SoAPULA. The clavicle scapula.is connected to the scapula by a distinct joint with the acromion, and by a strong ligament (coraco-clavicular) between it and the coracoid process. Fig. 40.^' Coraco-cla- CLAVICULAR LiGAMENTS.â€”The coraco-claviculaT ligament vicular has consists of two parts, each having a different direction and designation. a conical The posterior piece (fig. 40, called conoid from its shape, is fixed by its apex to the posterior and inner part of the coracoid process ; and by its base to the tubercle and the contiguous part of the under surface of the clavicle, at the junction of the outer with the middle third of the bone. * Ligaments of the clavicle and scapula and of the shoulder joint (altered from Bourgery and Jacob). 1. Conoid ligament. 2. Trape- zoid ligament. 3. Anterior ligament of the scapula. 4. Posterior scapular ligament. 5. Capsule of the shoulder joint. 6. Tendon of the long head of the biceps entering the joint. 7. Tendon of the sub- scapularis muscle. 8. Coraco-humeral ligament.

503 COURSE OF EXTERNAL HERNIA. The internal abdominal ring (fig. 75, is an aperture in Internal tlie fascia transversalis, which is situate mid-way between ring. ^ the symphysis pubis and the iliac crest, and half an inch situation, above Poupart's ligament. Arching above and on the inner Upper and side of the aperture, is the lower border of the transversalis muscle ; this is fleshy at the outer, but tendinous at the inner half. On the inner side of the opening lie the epi- inner gastric vessels. It is oval in form, the extremities of the ^^^^^^^J'- oval being directed upwards and downwards, and the fascia ^o^m and at its outer and lower parts is stronger than at the opposite side. This opening in the fascia transversalis is the inlet to the Parts trans- inguinal canal, and through it the cord, or the round liga- J^ro^ugh it ment, passes into the wall of the abdomen. The external hernia leaves likewise the abdomen at the same spot. All the protruding parts receive as a covering the prolongation from the margin of the opening. The external abdominal ring (fig. 73) is the outlet of the External inguinal canal, and through it the cord, or the inguinal ring, hernia, reaches the surface of the body. This aperture is Situation, placed in the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle, near the crest of the pubes ; and from the margin a prolongation is sent on the parts passing through it (see p. 485). Course and coverings of the hernia.—A piece of intestine Theintes- leaving the abdomen with the cord, and passing through the jig^the^^'^^ inguinal canal to the surface of the body, will obtain the course of same coverings as the cord, viz., one from every structure in the lateral part of the wall of the abdomen, except from the transversalis muscle. It receives its investments in this order :—As the intestine has cover- is first thrust outwards, it carries before it the peritoneum peritoneum and the subperitoneal fat, and enters the tube of the fascia and fat, transversalis (infundibuliform fascia) around the cord. Still verTalisI^^^^" increasing in size the piece of gut is forced downwards to the lower border of the internal oblique muscle, where it will have the cremasteric fascia or covering applied to it. cremaster, The intestine is afterwards directed along the front of the cord to the external abdominal ring, and in passing through that opening receives the investment of the intercolumnar f^s^c^^^*^^ or spermatic fascia. Lastly, as the hernia descends towards superficial the scrotum, it has the additional coverings of the superficial ' fascia and the skin. So that in a hernia which has passed the external abdominal ring, the coverings from without inwards are the following :—the skin and the superficial fascia, the spermatic and cremasteric fascise, the fascia trans-

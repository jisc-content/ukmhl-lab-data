DISSECTION OF THE THORAX. 370 cave upwards, which is the edge of the structure or valve that closed the opening in the fetus. This impression in the left auricle is above the fossa ovalis in the right cavity, Fig. 55.* Openings: four pul- monary veins. One into ventricle. Current of blood in adult; in fetus. because the aperture of communication between the two in the fetus was an oblique canal through the septum. The apertures in this auricle are those of the four pulmo- nary veins, two on each side, together with the opening of communication with the left ventricle. The mouths of each pair of pulmonary veins are close to one another ; thos from the right lung open into the extreme right of th auricle near the septum, and those from the left lung enter the opposite part of the cavity, near the auricula. Thes veins are not provided with valves. The aperture into th ventricle will be seen afterwards to have a large and com- plicated valve, as on the right side, to guard it. In the adult the blood enters this cavity from the lungs by the pulmonary veins, and passes to the left ventricle by the large inferior opening between the two. In the fetus, however, the lungs are impervious to the air and the mass * Left auricle and ventricle laid open (Quain's Anatomy). In the left auricle :—a. The septum auricularum. c. Four pulmo nary veins, e. Fossa on the septum—the remains of the foramen ovale. In the left ventricle :—i. Posterior flap of the mitral valve, n. The bundles of the musculi papillares. o. Thick wall of the ventricle.

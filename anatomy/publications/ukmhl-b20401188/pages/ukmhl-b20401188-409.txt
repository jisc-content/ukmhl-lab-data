389 THE TRACHEA AND BRONCHI. chial glands, the nerves, and the fibrous tissue from the part of the trachea in the thorax, and from the branches into which it bifurcates. The TRACHEA, or the air tube, reaches from the larynx to Trachea the lungs, and lies on the front of the spinal column. The neck^ ^^^^ tube begins at the lower part of the larynx, opposite the fifth cervical vertebra ; and it ends at the third dorsal ver- and in the tebra,^ by dividing into two pieces (bronchi), one for each where^lt lung, ends in Its connections in the neck are described at p. 127, and its structure at p. 178. The part in the thorax remains to be studied. In the thorax the trachea is situate with the great vessels Its connec- in the space between the pleural bags. Here it is covered thorax? by the arch of the aorta, by the innominate and left carotid arteries, and by the cardiac plexus of nerves ; and superficial to the arteries is the left innominate vein. Behind the air tube is the oesophagus, which is slightly inclined to the left near the arch of the aorta. On the right side are the vagus, and the innominate artery for a short distance after this has passed over the trachea ; and on the left side is the vagus with its recurrent branch. The bronchi, or the branches of the air tube, are contained Bronchi lie in the root of the lung, where they are surrounded by vessels, ^^g^^^gf. glands, and nerves. Near the lung each is divided into as many primary pieces as there are lobes to that viscus. In their structure and form the bronchi resemble the windpipe, are like the for they are round and cartilaginous in front, but flat, and fo^m.^^ muscular and membranous behind. Their position behind the other pulmonary vessels has been described at page 357; but the characters of each are now to be noticed. The right branch is about an inch in length, and is larger r^j^g ^ight than the left ; it passes outwards on a level with the fourth ^^^^'^ ^^^^^ dorsal vertebra, and is placed above the right pulmonary artery : the vena azygos arches over it. The left branch is about two inches long. It is directed left branch, obliquely downwards through the arch of the aorta, and joins the root of the left lung a vertebra lower than on the opposite side. In this course the tubes lie on the oesopha- course and gus and the thoracic duct, and on the descending aorta ; connections, it is at first below the level of the corresponding pulmonary artery. * The place of its bifurcation is sometimes opposite the fifth dorsal vertebra.

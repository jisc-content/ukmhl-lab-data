This muscle is partly covered by the ^^^^^^^ •,. deltoid ; and it rests on the long head of the triceps and the shoulder joint. Underneath it the dorsal branch of the subscapular artery turns. The TERES MAJOR musclc is extended from the inferior J^^^^^^^g^^^^^^ angle of the scapula to the humerus. Its origin is from lower angle the rough surface on the dorsum of the scapula at the in- of scapula ferior angle ; from the inferior costa of the bone within an inch of the long head of the triceps ; and from the fascia covering the teres minor. The fibres end in a tendon which to the hume- is inserted partly into, and partly behind the inner edge of the bicipital groove of the humerus. This muscle assists in forming the posterior fold of the Adjacent axilla ; and is situate beneath the axillary vessels and nerves near the humerus. At its origin it is covered by the latissi- mus dorsi. The upper border is contiguous to the sub- scapularis muscle, and the lower is received into a hollow formed by the fibres of the latissimus dorsi. At the I humerus the tendon of the muscle is one inch and a half to two inches wide, and is placed behind that of the latissi- Tendon and mus : the two are separated above by an interval and a bursa ; but they are united below, and an expansion is sent from them to the fascia of the arm. A second bursa is beneath the tendon between it and the bone. Below the scapula (inferior costa), where the teres muscles J'^^g^^^^^i^^ separate from one another, is a triangular interval, which is teres and bounded in front by the shaft of the humerus, and above triceps^ and below by the teres muscles. This space is divided into two by the long head of the triceps. Through the anterior p^g^g^^k)!'^^^ part, which is of a quadrilateral shape, the posterior cir- cumflex vessels and the circumflex nerve pass to the outer side of the limb ; and through the posterior smaller and triangular space, the dorsal branch of the subscapular artery turns to be distributed. Dissection.—In order that the acromion process may be Dissection sawn through to expose the supraspinatus muscle, the liga- ments of the scapula and clavicle, which would be injured by such a proceeding, should be next dissected. These ligaments will be recognised by removing the of ligaments fibrous tissue at the spots specified. One ligament (coraco- ^le*^^ clavicular) passes from the coracoid process to the under

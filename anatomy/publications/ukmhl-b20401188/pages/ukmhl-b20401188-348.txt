830 DISSECTION OF THE FOREAEM. Section VI. THE BACK OF THE rOREARM. Take away the super- ficial vessels and the fascia. Annular ligament be- hind the wrist. Two layers of muscles. Superficial has seven muscles, viz Supinator longus arises from humerus, Fosition.—During the dissection of the back of the fore- arm the limb lies with the fore part undermost, and a small block is to be placed beneath the wrist for the purpose of stretching the tendons. Dissection.—The fascia with the cutaneous nerves and vessels is to be reflected from the muscles of the forearm, and from the tendons on the back of the hand ; but a thick- ened band of it (posterior annular ligament), opposite the carpus, is to be left. If the integument has not been taken from the fingers, let the dissector proceed to remove it, in order that the tendons may be traced to the ends of the digits. The several muscles should be separated from one another up to their origin, especially the two radial extensors of the wrist. The posterior annular ligament consists of the special aponeurosis of the limb, thickened by the addition of some transverse fibres, and is situate opposite the lower ends of the bones of the forearm. This ligamentous band is con- nected at the outer part to the radius, and at the inner to the cuneiform and pisiform bones. It confines the extensor tendons, sending downwards processes which form sheaths for them, and are fixed to the bones beneath. The ligament v/ill be subsequently examined more in detail. Muscles on the back of the forearm.—The muscles are arranged in a superficial and a deep layer, as thej'' are on the front of the forearm. The superficial layer is composed of seven muscles, which arise mostly by a common tendon from the outer condyle of the humerus, and have the under- mentioned position one to another. Proceeding from without inwards the student will find in succession the long supinator, the two radial extensors of the wrist (long and short), the common extensor of the fingers, the extensor of the little finger, and lastly the ulnar extensor of the wrist. There is one other small muscle near the elbow, the anconeus. The SUPINATOR RADII LONGUS (fig. 45, ^) is contained partly in the arm and partly in the forearm, and limits ou the outer side the hollow in front of the elbow. The muscle arises from the upper two thirds of the outer condyloid ridge of the humerus, and from the front of the external inter- muscular septum. The fleshy fibres end above the middle of

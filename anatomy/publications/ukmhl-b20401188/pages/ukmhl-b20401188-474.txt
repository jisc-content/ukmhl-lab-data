CHAPTER VII. DISSECTION OF THE PERINiEUM. Section I. PERINEUM OF THE MALE. Before the dissection pass cathe- ter. Place the body in position, and fasten upwards the The surface, limits. The anus. Directions,—The perin^eum may be allotted with greatest advantage to the dissector of the abdomen. Its examina- tion should be made before that of the abdomen, as the distinctness of many of the parts is destroyed soon after death. Before the body is placed in the position suited for the dissection, the student may practise passing the catheter along the urethra. Fosition of the body.—Whilst the body lies on the back it is to be drawn to the end of the dissecting table, till the buttocks project slightly over the edge ; and a moderately- sized block is to be placed beneath the pelvis, to raise the perinseum to a convenient height. The legs are to be raised and kept out of the way by the following means :—After the knees have been bent, and the thighs bent upon the trunk, the limbs are to be fastened with a cord in their raised position. For this purpose make one or two turns of the cord round one bent knee (say the right), carry the cord beneath the table, and, encircling the opposite limb in the same manner, fasten it finally round the right knee. When the position has been arranged, let the student raise the scrotum, and place a small bit of cotton wool or tow within the anus, but let him avoid distending the rectum. Superficial limits, mid marking of the surface.—The perinseal space in the male is limited, on the surface of the body, by the scrotum in front, and by the thighs and buttocks on the sides and behind. This region is of a dark colour, and is covered with hairs. About its centre is the aperture of the anus, which is pos- terior to a line extended from the anterior part of the one ischial tuberosity to the other. In front of the anus the

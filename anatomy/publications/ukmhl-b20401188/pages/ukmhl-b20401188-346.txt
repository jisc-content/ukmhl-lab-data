The dorsal interossei (fig. 48) extend farther back than the palmar set, and arise by a two- fold attachment to the lateral surfaces of the metacarpal bones between which they lie. The dorsal muscles are thus allotted to the digits :—two belong to the middle finger, one is con- nected with the radial side of the fore, and one with the ulnar side of the ring finger. They may be considered abductors from the middle line of the second finger : thus the muscles attached to the fore and Fig. 48.t Common in- sertion of both sets. First dorsal interosseous ring fingers will draw those digits from the middle one ; and the two muscles of the middle finger will carry this digit to the right and left of a line passing through its centre. The first or external muscle of this set is noticed separately below under the name abductor indicis. Both sets of muscles have a similar termination (fig. 46, ^') : —the fibres end in a tendon, which is inserted into the side of the first or metacarpal phalanx, and sends an expansion to join the aponeurotic covering on the dorsum of the bone. The abductor indicis, or the first dorsal interosseous muscle, arises from nearly the whole * The three palmar interosseous muscles : they are named nume rically from the outer side. + Dorsal interosseous muscles of the hand, which are numbered like the palmar set, from the outer to the inner side.

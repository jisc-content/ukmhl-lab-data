531 COOTECTIOITS OF THE AORTA AND CAYA. on each side of the aorta, which is connected with the solar and renal plexuses. The spermatic plexus is formed by roots from both the Spermatic aortic and the renal plexus. The nerves from it run on the P^®^^^- spermatic artery to the testicle ; and in the cord they join other filaments on the vas deferens. In the female, the nerves on the ovarian (spermatic) artery In female, are supplied to the ovary and the uterus. The inferior mese^iteric plexus surrounds the trunk and inferior branches of the artery of the same name, and supplies the ^gxus!^^^^ same part of the intestinal tube as the artery. This plexus is furnished from the left part of the aortic plexus ; and the nerves composing it are whiter and larger than in either of the preceding offsets of the sympathetic. Near the Nerves join intestine (sigmoid flexure) the branching of the nerves, and y^g^sels^ the union of contiguous twigs, are well marked. Branches.—The following secondary plexuses are named Secondary from the arteries they accompany, and are distributed like P^^^^^^s. them to the intestine, viz., the left colic, the sigmoid, and the superior haemorhoidal ^dIcxus. On the intestinal tube the nerves of one plexus join those Union of the of another. Thus the superior mesenteric joins by one end the^ntesti- the nerves to the duodenum, and by the other the nerves to nai tube, the large intestine from the inferior mesenteric plexus. And the inferior mesenteric nerves communicate below with branches to the rectum from the pelvic plexus. The hypogastric plexus, or the large prevertebral centre Hypogastric for the supply of sympathetic nerves to the viscera of the pie^^s. pelvis, is situate in front of the upper part of the sacrum and beneath the peritoneum. It is developed more on each situation, side than in the centre ; and the nerves, v»rhich are large and flat, have a plexiform arrangement, but without any ganglionic masses on them. By its upper part the plexus in it aortic receives on each side the termination of the aortic plexus ; eids^ and it is joined by some filaments from one or two of the "upper sacral ganglia. Inferiorly the plexus ends in two and from it parts, right and left, the last being the largest, which are gfnfto pel- continued forwards with the branches of the internal iliac vie viscera, artery to the pelvic plexuses and the viscera. Connections of the Aorta and Yen a Cava.—The Parts connections of the abdominal aorta and of the vena cava and^cava^^^^ may be next looked to, before the viscera are removed from the body.

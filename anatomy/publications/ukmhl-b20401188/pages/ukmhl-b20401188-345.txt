827 EADIAL AETERY AND BRANCHES. Branches of the radial artery. —As soon as the radial ^^5^^^^^'^^^^ artery enters the hand, it gives oJff the large artery of the radial, thumb, and the digital branch of the index finger :— 1. The large artery of the thumb (art. princeps pollicis) runs Digital along the first metacarpal bone, between the abductor indicis th? thumb, and the flexor brevis pollicis, to reach the interval between the heads of the last muscle, where it divides into the two collateral branches of the thumb : these are distributed like the arteries of the superficial arch. 2. The digital branch of the index finger (art. radialis Digital indicis) is directed over the abductor indicis, and beneath to^erl^^ the short flexor and the adductor pollicis, to the radial side of the fore finger. At the free or anterior border of the abductor indicis this branch is connected by an ofiset with the superficial palmar arch ; and at the end of the finger it unites with the digital branch furnished to the opposite side by the ulnar artery. The deep branch of the ulnar nerve accompanies the deep Deep branch palmar arch of the radial artery as far as the muscles of the ^erve^^ thumb, and terminates in branches to the adductor pollicis, the inner head of the short flexor, and the abductor indicis. Branches.—Near its origin the nerve furnishes branches Muscular off- to the muscles of the little finger. In the palm it gives an^®^^* ofi'set to each palmar and dorsal interosseous muscle, and to each of the inner two lumbrical muscles, besides the terminal branches to the muscles before mentioned. The transverse metacarpal ligament connects together the Ligament of heads of the metarcarpal bones. Its cutaneous surface is metacarpal hollowed where the flexor tendons cross it ; and beneath it bones, the interossei muscles pass to their insertion. To the poste- rior border the fascia covering the interossei muscles is united. This ligament should be taken away to see the interossei muscles. The INTEROSSEI MUS(JLES are so named from their position Seven inter- between the metacarpal bones, and are seven in number. ^J®^ Two muscles occupy each space, except in the first where there is only one, and they are inserted into the first phalanx of the fingers. They are divided into palmar and dorsal divided into interossei; but all the small muscles are evident in the palm "^^^i of the hand, though some project more than the others. The val mar muscles (fig. 47) are three in number, and are Number and smaller than the dorsal set, although they are most promi- p^^^jP^ nent in the palm of the hand. Undivided at the posterior part, they arise from the palmar surface of the metacarpal bones of the fingers on which they act, viz. those of the fore,

529 INFERIOR MESENTERIC VESSELS. from it, and the branches should be traced outwards to the remaining half of the large intestine : a part of the artery enters the pelvis, but this will be dissected afterwards. On the artery and its branches is the inferior mesenteric plexus of nerves. The mesenteric vein is to be followed upwards to its junction with the splenic, or with the superior mesen- teric vein. On the aorta the dissector will meet with a plexus of nerves which is to be left uninjured. The inferior mesenteric artery (fig. 78, supplies branches inferior to the part of the large intestine beyond the transverse colon, ^^tery.*^^^Â° and communicating with the superior mesenteric, assists to maintain the chain of anastomosis along the intestinal tube. This vessel is of smaller size than the superior mesenteric, and arises from the aorta from one to two inches above the bifurcation. At first the vessel descends on the aorta, and Place of crosses the left common iliac artery in its course to the pelvis, where it ends in branches to the rectum (superior heemo- Course rhoidal).

The inferior mesenteric vein (fig. 79, d) begins in the part inferior of the great intestine to which its companion artery is dis- tributed, and ascends along the psoas muscle, away from the artery, to open into the splenic vein beneath the pancreas. Occasionally it joins the superior mesenteric vein.

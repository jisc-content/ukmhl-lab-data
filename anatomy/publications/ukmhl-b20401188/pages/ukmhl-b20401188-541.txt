FOLDS OF THE PERITONEUM. 521 Lastly, tlie serous membrane is continued to tlie inguinal ^^^^^^"1^ region, where it presents the pouches before alluded to (p. 507) ; and it can be traced upwards on the wall of the abdomen and over the diaphragm and liver to the under surface of that viscus in front of the vessels. Folds of the peritoneum,—After tracing the continuity of ^^^^^^^^^'^^^ the serous sac over the viscera, the student is to learn the peritoneum, chief folds or processes of the membrane in connection with the alimentary tube. The pieces of the peritoneum fixing the liver will be examined afterwards : and the folds on the viscera of the pelvis will be seen with the dissection of that cavity. Folds on the stomach.—The processes of the serous mem- Onthe brane connected with the stomach are named omenta, ^^^^t? They are three in number :—one, small omentum, is at- tached to the upper curve ; another, great omentum, to the lower curve; and the third, splenic omentum, is fixed to the great end of the viscus. The sm.all or gastro-hepatic omentum is stretched between Small the under surface of the liver and the upper border of the stomach, and contains the vessels and nerves of the liver. It is formed by two pieces of peritoneum^ as before explained, Situation, and presents a free border on the right side. Behind it is the space called foramen of Winslow. Its lower border is Attacii- fixed to the small curve of the stomach ; whilst its upper ""-^^^s- border is attached to the transverse fissure, as v/ell as to the posterior half of the longitudinal fissure of the liver, blending with the left lateral ligament of the viscus. The gastro-colic or great omentum is the largest fold of Great the peritoneum, and consists of two pieces, which are con- tinuous with the membrane on the front and back of the attach- ments. stomach. It is attached above to the spleen and the lower border of the stomach, and descends in front of the intestine, but lower on the left than the right side of the body. At the lower part of the abdomen the fold is bent backwards. Forms a fold and returns towards the spine, the pieces of which it is small intes- composed separating and enclosing the transverse colon as before seen. Between its layers are contained some fat, [^°o^iayei°s! and some vessels and nerves ; and the power of separating the one layer from the other diminishes with the increase of the distance from the stomach, until at last they are not to be separated, and the membrane they form is thin and net-like. The anterior part of the omental fold is separated from

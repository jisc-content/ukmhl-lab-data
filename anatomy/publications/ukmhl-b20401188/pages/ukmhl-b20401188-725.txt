OBTURATOR l^ERYE. 699 (p. 599), and supplies the adductor muscles of the thigh, as well as the hip and knee joints. The nerve issues from the pelvis through the aperture in the upper part of the thyroid foramen ; and it divides in that opening into two parts, is divided which are named superficial and deep from their position ^^^^ with respect to the adductor brevis muscle. The anterior or superficial part of the nerve joins the The super- plexus of the internal cutaneous and saphenous nerves at the ^^^^^^ ^^^^ inner aspect of the thigh (p. 694). The nerve is directed over the adductor brevis, but beneath the pectineus and the adductor longus. At the lower border of the last muscle it joins plexus furnishes an offset to join in the interlacement of the nerves, the thigh, but the remainder of it is continued to the femoral artery, ends on on which it is distributed. In addition to the branches before mentioned, the nerve supplies the hip joint and some of the surrounding muscles, and receives (sometimes) the communicating twig from its accessory branch. a. Near the pelvis or in the aperture of exit, the nerve ^^^^^J^J^^p sends outwards an articular twig to the hip joint, with the joint, artery to the same part. h. Muscular branches are furnished to the adductor longus. Muscular to the adductor brevis, and the gracilis. adductors. Unusual condition of the nerve.—In some bodies this super- This part ficial part of the nerve is of large size, and extends beyond i^^^^ the plexus in the middle of the thigh. In such instances it joins freely in the plexus, and gives cutaneous offsets to the integuments of the thigh ; it is continued afterwards along the inner border of the sartorius to the side of the knee, and extend where it perforates the fascia to end in the integuments. It ^ has a distribution similar to that of the inner branch of the internal cutaneous nerve (p. 694), whose place it takes. The posterior or deep part of the obturator nerve pierces i>eep part of the fibres of the external obturator muscle, and is continued beneath the adductor brevis to be distributed chiefly in the adductor magnus. Offsets are given from it to the contiguous muscles, and one to supply the knee joint. a. Muscular branches enter the obturator externus as the ^^^^^^q^. nerve pierces it ; others are furnished to the large, and maguus, sometimes also to the short adductor. h. A slender articular branch enters the fibres of the and gives adductor magnus towards the lower part, and passes through knee joint. it near the linea aspera to reach the popliteal artery, by which it is conducted to the back of the knee joint : its termination is seen in the dissection of the popliteal space.

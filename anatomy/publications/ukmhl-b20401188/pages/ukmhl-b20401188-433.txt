LIGAMENTS OF THE YERTEBE.E. 413 of the muscles. The band called ligamentum michse, wMcli is composed of fibrous tissue, takes its place in the neck. Along the spinal column there are also thin and somewhat and be- membranous inters]oi7ioiis ligaments (fig. 58, which reach Fig. 65.* from the root to the tip of the spinous processes. The strength of these bands is dependent upon the interval they have to fill; they are more marked in the lumbar than in the other vertebrae, and they are least strong in the cervical region. Ligaments of the transverse processes.—In the loins the Those of the intertransverse ligaments are thin membranous bands in the processes^ intervals between the processes. In the dorsal vertebrae they are round bundles of fibres (fig. 65, ^). And in the neck the fibres exist only at the apex of the processes, or they may be wanting here and there. * Ligaments of tlie processes of the vertebrae, and of the ribs. (Bourgery.)—1. Supraspinous band of ligament. 2. Ligamentum sub- flavum. 3. Posterior costo-transverse ligament: on the opposite side the band has been removed and the joint opened. 4. Intertransverse ligament.

DISSECTIOIT OF THE PELYIS. 652 Open the uterus. Its thick- ness. In the interior the peritoneum are attached ;—viz., the Fallopian tube at the top (s), the round ligament rather below and before it, and the ovary (o), and its ligament (p) below and behind the others. Dissection.—To examine the interior of the uterus, a cut is to be made along the anterior wall from the fundus to the OS uteri ; and then some of the tissue is to be taken away on each side of the middle line to show the contained cavity. The thickness of the uterine wall is greatest opposite the middle of the body. It is greater at the centre than at the angles of the fundus (fig. 99), the wall becoming thinner towards the attachment of the Fallopian tubes. Interior of the uterus (fig. 99).—Within the uterus is a Fig. 99.* small space, which is divided artificially into two—one of the body, another of the neck of the organ, isatrian- The space occupvinof the body of the viscus is triansfular gular space j- x»/ o «/ <-> in the body, in form, and is larger than the other. Its base is at the fundus of the uterus, where it is convex towards the cavity, and the angles are prolonged towards the Fallopian tubes. The apex is directed downwards, and joins the cavity in the cervix by a narrowed circular part, isthmus (os uteri inter- num), which may be narrower than the opening of the uterus into the vagina. which is narrowed below; * Cavity of the uterus aind vagina shown, with a posterior view of the broad ligament.—a.

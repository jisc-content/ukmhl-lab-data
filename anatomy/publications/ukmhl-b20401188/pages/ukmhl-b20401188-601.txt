581 EPIDIDYMIS AND VAS DEFERENS. to eight inches long ; and they join the excretory duct at intervals of about three inches. The EXCRETORY DUCT of the testis receives the vasa elFe- Excretory rentia from the upper part of the gland, and extends thence ^^^^ to the urethra. Its first part, which is in contact with the testis, is very flexuous, and forms the epididymis : but the remainder is straight, and is named vas deferens. The epididymis extends in the form of an arch, along the is bent on outer side of the testis, from the upper to the lower end, formhig^^*^ and receives its name from its situation. Opposite the upper epididymis, part of the testicle it presents an enlarged portion or head, the globus major ; and at the lower part of that organ it becomes more pointed or tail-like—globus minor^ before its parts, ending in the vas deferens. The intervening narrow part of the epididymis is called the body. Its head is attached to the testis by the vasa elFerentia ; and its tail or lower part is fixed to the tunica albuginea by some fibrous tissue, and by the reflection of the tunica vaginalis. After the removal is but a of the serous membrane and some fibrous tissue, the epidi- ^^^S"^® ^^^be; dymis may be seen to be formed of a single tube, bent into a zigzag form, whose bends are united into one mass by fibrous tissue. This part of the tube, when uncoiled, mea- leng-th and sures twenty feet in length. The diameter of its canal is about y^th of an inch ; but there is a slight diminution in size towards the globus minor. The vas deferens begins opposite the lower end of the where it is testis, at the termination of the globus minor of the epidi- fg^J-^^f ^^^^ dymis. At first this part of the excretory duct is slightly deferens; wavy, but afterwards it becomes for the most part a firm round tube. In its course to the urethra, it ascends on the inner side of the testicle and along the bloodvessels of the spermatic cord, with which it enters the internal abdominal ring ; it is then directed over the side of the bladder, and this opens through the prostate to open on the inner surface of the latter (p. 612). The length of this part of the excretory length and duct is about two feet, and the width of its canal about ^^^th ^i^®- of an inch. isTear its termination the vas deferens becomes enlarged and tortuous ; but this condition will be referred to with the viscera of the pelvis. Opening sometimes into the vas deferens, at the angle Vasaben-ans of union with the epididymis, is a small narrow csecal preseirTf^^^ appendage, the vas aberrans of Haller. It is convoluted, situation and projects upwards for two or three inches amongst the vessels of the cord. Like the epididymis, it is much longer when it is unravelled, measuring sometimes fourteen inches ; and size.

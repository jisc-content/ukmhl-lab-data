659 INTERNAL PELVIC MUSCLES. sharp pulley-like surface at the back of tlie hip bone corre- over the spending with the small sacro-sciatic notch. Outside the ^^P^^^®- pelvis the tendons blend into one, which is inserted into the insertion, great trochanter. The pelvic portion of the muscle is in contact by one sur- ^^[^^^^ face with the wall of the pelvis and the obturator membrane ; in pelvic and by the other surface with the fascia lining the pelvic ^^^^^y> wall, and towards its lower border with the pudic vessels and nerve. Above the level of the levator ani, viz. a line from the lower part of the symphysis pubis to the ischial perineal spine, the muscle corresponds with the cavity of the pelvis, space, but below that line, with the ischio-rectal fossa. CoccYGEUS Muscle.—The position and the connections of Coccygeus this muscle may be now studied in the interior of the pelvis. The muscle is described at p. 605. The several bones of the pelvis have the following articu- Outline of lations with one another. The sacrum is joined by its base laUo^us^^^ to the last lumbar vertebra, and by its apex to the coccyx. Laterally this central bone is united with the two innomi- nate bones. And the innominate bones are connected together in front, as well as to the sacrum and the spinal column posteriorly. Sack,o-VERTEBRAL Aeticulation".—The base of the sacrum union of is articulated with the last lumbar vertebra by ligaments sacmm with , H.\ ^^^^ verte- similar to those unitmg one vertebra to another (p. 407) ; bra. and by one special ligament—the sacro-vertebral. Dissection.—For the best manner of bringing these dif- Dissection, ferent ligaments into view, the dissector must consult the directions already given for the dissection of the ligaments of the vertebrjB (p. 408). The common ligaments between the bodies of the two Byliga- bones are an anterior and a posterior, with an intervening ^jQ^^erte-^^ fibro-cartilaginous substance. Between the neural arches brse, are the ligamenta subflava ; between the spines, the supra and interspinous bands; and between the articular processes are capsular ligaments and synovial membranes. The sacro-vertehral or intertransverse ligament (fisj. 100^) and by special IS a strong bundle of fibres, which reaches from the under band, sacro- surface of the tip of the trains verse process of the last lumbar "vertebral, vertebra to the lateral part of the base of the sacrum (trans- verse process). Widening as it descends, the ligament joins the fibres in front of the lateral articulation between the sacrum and the innominate bone. Saoro-coccygeal Articulation-. —The bodies of the Union of sacrum and coccyx are united by a fibro-cartilage, and by coccyx. '^^^ u u 2

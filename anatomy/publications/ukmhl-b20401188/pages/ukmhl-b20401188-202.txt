Between a. Union of the occipital hone with the axis.'—The central ax?sisa ligament (occipito-axoidean) (fig. 26, ^) is a strong, thick tralband' which is connected with the posterior ligament of the bodies of the vertebrse, and is rather pyramidal in form with the base uppermost. Above it is attached to the basilar pro- Fig. 26.* cess on the cranial aspect and near the margin of the foramen magnum, extending as far on each side as the insertion of the check ligaments. From this spot it descends over the odontoid process, and, becoming narrower, is inserted into the body of the axis. Occasionally a bursa is found between the transverse ligament of the atlas and the superficial fibres of this occipito-axoidean ligament which are continued to the second vertebra. Dissection. Dissection.—After the removal of the occipito-axoidean ligament, the student should define a strong band, the trans- verse ligament, which crosses the root of the odontoid pro- cess, and sends upwards and downwards a process to the occipital bone and the axis. The upper ofi'set from the transverse ligament may be cut through afterwards for the * Internal ligament between occipital bone and axis (Bourgery). 1 and 2.

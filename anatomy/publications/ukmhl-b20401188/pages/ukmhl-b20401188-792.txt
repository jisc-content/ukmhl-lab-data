radiate to their insertion below in this manner ;—The pos- terior (') are directed to the hinder part of the inner surface of the astragalus ; the middle (^) pass vertically to the side of the sustentaculum tali of the os calcis; and the anterior (^), which are thin and oblique, join the inferior calcaneo- scaphoid ligament and the inner side of the scaphoid bone. The tendons of the tibialis posticus and flexor longus digi- torum are in contact with this ligament. External The external lateral ligament (fig. 114) consists of three parts^^^^ separate pieces, anterior, middle, and posterior: two of these (anterior and posterior) are attached to the astragalus, and anterior, the other to the OS calcis. The anterior piece Q) is a short flat band, which is directed from the fore part of the mal- leolus to the part of the astragalus in front of the lateral middle, articular surface. The middle portion (^) is flattened, and descends from the tip of the malleolus to the outer surface andpos- of the OS calcis, about the middle. T\\q posterior part (^) is the strongest, and is almost horizontal in direction ; it is * Internal lateral ligament of tlie ankle (altered from Bourgeiy). —1. Posterior piece. 2. Middle piece, 3. Anterior piece of the inner ligament, 4. Inferior calcaneo-Ecaphoid ligament.

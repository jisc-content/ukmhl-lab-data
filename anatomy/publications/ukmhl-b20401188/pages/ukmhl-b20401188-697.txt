SUPERFICIAL VESSELS. .671 inner side of the saphenous vein, and close to the pubes ; and one of the branches of the genito-crural nerve may be found a little outside the vein. Superficial Vessels. —The small cutaneous arteries at The arteries the top of the thigh are the highest branches of the femoral fe^ral. artery, and are furnished by that trunk as soon as it enters the thigh. They pierce the deep fascia of the limb (fascia lata), and are distributed in the integuments and the glands of the groin. A vein accompanies each artery, having the same name Veins join as its companion vessel, and ends in the upper part of the ^ous^^^^ saphenous vein ; but the description of these veins will be given in a subsequent page (673). The external pudic artery (superior) crosses the spermatic cord in its course inwards, and ends in the integuments of artery*^^^ the penis and scrotum, where it anastomoses with offsets of the internal pudic artery. Another external pudic branch another be- (inferior) pierces the fascia lata at the inner border of the fascia. ^ thigh, and ramifies also in the scrotum. In the female these branches supply the labium pudendi. The superficial epigastric artery passes over Poupart's Superficial ligament to the lower part of the abdomen (p. 480), and epigastric, communicates with branches of the deep epigastric artery. The superficial circumfiex iliac artery is the smallest of Superficial the three branches ; and appearing on the outer border of the thigh near the iliac crest, is distributed in the integu- ments. The superficial inguinal glands are arranged in two lines, ^^^^^^f^ One set lies across the thigh, near Poupart's ligament; and two sets, the other is situate along the side of the saphenous vein. In the lower or longitudinal collection the glands are larger which re- than in the upper, and the lymphatic vessels from the y^jj^iyj^®' surface of the lower limb enter them ; whilst the upper or phatics. transverse set are joined by the lymphatics of the penis, and by those of the lower part of the abdomen and the buttocks. The glands vary much in number and size, and not unfre- quently those by the side of the vein are united together. Dissection. —The deeper layer of the superficial fascia is to Raise the be detached from the subjacent fascia lata, by means of^^^^^f^^^ incisions similar to those for reflecting the subcutaneous superficial stratum, except that the lower cut across the thigh is not to be made so far down. The handle of the scalpel is to be employed in the separation, and the dissector is to endeavour to avoid cutting the nerves and vessels. Internal to the saphenous vein a thin membrane can be easily raised, but

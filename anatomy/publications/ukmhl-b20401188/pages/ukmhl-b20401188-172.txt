DISSECTIOISr OF THE HEAD. 156 goid muscle. By its inner surface the ganglion is in contact with the Eustachian tube, and at a little distance behind is Structure, the middle meningeal artery. In this ganglion, as in the others above referred to, filaments from motor, sensory, and sympathetic nerves are blended. Some twigs are furnished by it to muscles. Fig. 20.^' Branches a. Connecting branches—roots. —The ganglion is joined by imh^*^^^^^ a fasciculus from the motor part of the inferior maxillary nerve, and is closely united with the branch of that nerve to the internal pterygoid muscle, thus receiving two of its sympathetic roots, motor and sensory, from the fifth nerve. Its connec- tion with the sympathetic is established by a twig that is received from the plexus on the middle meningeal artery. Further, the ganglion is connected with the tympanic nerve by means of the small superficial petrosal nerve, 6, which joins the posterior part. ^ 6. Branches to muscles.—Two muscles receive their nerves from the otic ganglion, viz. tensor tympani and circumflexus palati. The nerve to the tensor tympani (fig. 20) is directed backwards, and enters the bony canal that contains that muscle. The branch for the circum- and tyiH' panic nerves. Other branches enter muscles. * Inner view of the otic ganglion (Arnold), a. Internal pterygoid muscle with its nerve entering it. h. External carotid artery with the sympathetic on it. 1.

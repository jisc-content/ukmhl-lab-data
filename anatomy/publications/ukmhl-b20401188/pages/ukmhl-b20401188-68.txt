52 DISSECTIO^T OF THE ORBIT. Apertures in eyelids. Canals for the tears. Difference in the two lids. Receptacle of the tears. Situation of the sac, or dilated part. Canal lead- tion from the tendo palpebrarum over the sac should likewise be prepared. The puncta lachrymalia are two small apertures, one for each lid, by which the tears enter the lachrymal canals. Each is situate in the free margin of the lid, about a quarter of an inch from the inner canthus, and in Fig. 7.* the elevation of the papilla lachrymalis. The lachrymal ca- nals (fig. 7, ^) are two small tubes that come from the puncta, and convey the tears to the lachrymal sac ; their situation is marked by the bristles that have been inserted in them. In their course in- wards the canals lie along the tendo-palpe- brarum, one above and the other below it, and they are somewhat arched with the concavity towards the tendon. Internally, they open near together into the lachrymal sac rather above its middle. The canal in the upper eyelid is longer and more arched than that in the lower lid. The lachrymal sac and duct (fig. 7) extend from the inner part of the orbit to the nose, and convey the tears into the latter cavity. They form one tube, of which the upper dilated part is the sac, and the lower constricted end the duct. The sac, 2, is situate in the hollow formed by the os unguis and nasal process of the superior maxillary bone. Externally it is crossed by the ligament or tendon of the eyelids, and is covered by an expansion, derived from that tendon, which is fixed to the margins of the bony groove. If the aponeurotic covering be removed, the mucous mem- brane lining the interior will be seen. Into the outer side of the sac the lachrymal canals open. The duct, 3 (ductus ad nasum), is the narrowed part of the * The eyelids and lachrymal apparatus. 1. Lachrymal canals. 2. Lachrymal sac. 3. Lachrymal duct. 4. Plica semilunaris. 5.

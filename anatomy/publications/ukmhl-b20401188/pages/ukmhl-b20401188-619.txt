599 BEAlSrCHES OF THE LUMBAR PLEXUS. The genito-criiral nerve ('') is distributed, as the name ex- Genito- presses, to the genital organs and the limb. It arises from the second .lumbar nerve, and from the connecting loop between the first two ; it pierces the fibres of the psoas, and pierces descending on the surface of the muscle divides into a ofenital and a crural branch. Sometimes the nerve is divides ^ , mto divided in the psoas, and the branches perforate separately the muscle. a. The genital branch descends on the external iliac artery, genital and and furnishes ofl*sets around it ; it passes from the abdomen with th@ spermatic vessels, and is distributed in the cre- master muscle. In the female the nerve is lost in the round ligament. b. The crural branch issues beneath Poupart's ligament ^^^^^^ to supply the integument of the thigh. (See Cutaneous jN'erves of the Thigh.) The external cutaneous nerve of the thigh (^) arises from Course of the second nerve of the plexus, or from the loop between it cutaneous and the third, and appears about the middle of the outer border of the psoas. The nerve then takes an oblique course across the iliacus to the interval between the anterior to reach the iliac spinous processes, and leaves the abdomen beneath Poupart's ligament to be distributed on the outer aspect of the limb. The anterior crural nerve ('^) is the largest ofi"set of the ^^^j^j.^^^^ plexus, and supplies branches to the extensor muscles of the crural knee joint, and the front of the thigh. Taking origin from the third and fourth nerves, and receiving a fasciculus also from the second, this large nerve appears towards the lower part of the psoas, and lies between that muscle and ^l^^'j^^jj^"^ the iliacus. It passes from the abdomen beneath Poupart's men; ligament ; but before its final branching in the thigh, the its branches nerve furnishes the following twigs :— a. Some small branches are given to the iliacus from the to iliacus, outer side of the nerve. b. A branch to the femoral artery, whose place of origin varies much, is distributed around the upper part of that vessel. The obturator nerve (^) appertains to the adductor muscles Obturator of the thigh. Derived from the third and fourth nerves in abdomen; ^ Ilio-ingmnal branch. 3. External cutaneous branch. 4. Anterior crural nerve. 5. Accessory branch to the obturator. 6. Obturator nerve. 7. Genito-crural nerve—its two offsets coming separately from the plexus.' 8. Lumbar part of the gangliated cord of the sympathetic nerve.

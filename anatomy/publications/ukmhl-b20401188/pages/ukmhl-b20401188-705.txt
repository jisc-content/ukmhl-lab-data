CRURAL ARCH AND SHEATH. 679 bone is closed by the parts passing from the abdomen to ^'f^^ the thigh, and is larger in the female than in the male. The outer half of the interval is filled by the fleshy psoas and iliacus muscles, to which the arch is closely bound by fascia; and the inner half of the space is occupied by the femoral vessels and their sheath. Gimhernafs ligament—The structure named Gimbernat's f^J.^^^^^^^'^ ligament, is the part of the tendon of the external oblique muscle of the abdomen that is inserted into the pectineal line of the hip bone (p. 487). Viewing it as a separate ^oj^^^j^^^j^*^^^' structure, it is about one inch in length and triangular in conuections. shape. Its apex is at the pubic spine ; whilst its base is in contact with the crural sheath, and is blended with the fascia lata,—the part that forms the outer side of the saphenous opening. By one margin (anterior) it is continuous with the crural arch, and by the opposite it is fixed to the pectineal line. In the erect position of the body the ligament is almost horizontal, and one surface is directed upwards to the abdominal cavity, whilst the other is turned towards the thigh. On forcibly raising the crural arch, the continuity poJip^^'g. of Gimbernat's ligament with that band will plainly appear. The crural sheath (fig. 75, ^) is a loose tube of membrane Crural around the femoral vessels. It has the form of a funnel sloped unequally on the sides. The wide part or base of ^^^P® the tube is upwards ; and the narrow part ceases about connec- two inches below Poupart's ligament by blending with the common areolar sheath of the bloodvessels. Its outer border is nearly straight, and is perforated by the genito-crural nerve. Its inner border is oblique, and is pierced by the lymphatics and the saphenous vein ; this part of the sheath appears in the saphenous opening, and is connected to the falciform margin and the superficial fascia. In front of the crural sheath and behind it is the fascia lata of the thigh. The sheath is continuous with the fasciae lining the abdomen How in this way;—the anterior part is prolonged beneath Poupart's ligament into the fascia transversalis, and the posterior half is continued into ihe fascia iliaca (p. 510). Crossing the front of the crural sheath below the arch of '^^^^^f Poupart's ligament, is a thickened fibrous band, which has been named the deep crural arch. A notice of it is given with the description of the fascia transversalis (p. 497). This band is supposed to occasion sometimes the stricture of the subjacent intestine in a femoral hernia. Dissection.—The student is to open the sheath by an Open tbo incision across the front, and to raise the loose anterior part H^^^^^

DISSECTIOIT OF THE THIGH. in the contiguous part of the thigh internal to the saphe- nous vein. Genito-crural.—The crural branch of this nerve (p. 599) pierces the fascia lata near Poupart's ligament (fig. 102, rather external to the line of the Fig. 102.^' femoral artery. After the nerve has become superficial it communicates I \ with the middle cutaneous nerve, and extends on the anterior aspect of the thigh as far as midway between the knee and the pelvis. Occasion- ^ ally this branch is of large size, and takes the place of branches of the external cutaneous nerve on the outer side of the limb. The external cutaneous nerve (p. 599) is distributed on the outer aspect of the limb (fig. 102, =^). At first it is contained in a prominent ridge of the fascia lata on the outer margin of the thigh, where it divides into an anterior and a posterior branch. a. The posterior branch is soon subdivided into two or three others, which arch backwards, supplying the integuments of the outer part of the ^ thigh as low as the middle ; and the || highest offsets are crossed by branches of the last dorsal nerve. h. The anterior branch extends to the lower half of the thigh. It ap- pears on the surface of the fascia lata, about four inches from Poupart's ligament; and, continued to the knee, , it distributes branches laterally, but those towards the outer i, and posterior surfaces are the most numerous, and the , laro-est in size. Near the knee it communicates sometimes with the branch of the great saphenous nerve. Middle cutaneous (fig. 102 ^).—The nerve for the centre [ of the thigh in front is a cutaneous offset from the anterior ' * Cutaneous nerves on the fore part of the thigh.—1. Ilio-hypogas- tric branch on the belly. 2. Ilio-inguinal nerve. 3. 3. External cutaneous—the two parts. 4. Middle cutaneous. 5. 5. Internal ; cutaneous: the lower figure marks the anterior branch of the nerve. 6. Saphenous nerve. 7. Crural branch of the genito-crural nerve.

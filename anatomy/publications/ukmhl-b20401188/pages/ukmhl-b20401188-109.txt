93 INTERIN^AL MAXILLAEY ARTERY. of the auriculo-temporal nerve close beneath. On drawing forwards the pterygoid muscle, and removing some fat, the dissector will find the trunk and branches of the inferior maxillary nerve. All the four small muscular branches of the nerve should be traced to the trunk in the foramen ovale of the sphenoid bone ; its auriculo-temporal branch should be followed backwards with care behind the articulation ; and the small chorda tympani should be found joining the posterior part of the gustatory nerve near the skull. The middle meningeal artery is to be sought beneath the external pterygoid ; and oftentimes the trunk of the internal maxillary artery will be found beneath that muscle. The INTERNAL MAXILLARY ARTERY (fig. 11, is OUe of Internal the terminal branches of the external carotid, and takes a ^J^yf^ winding course beneath the lower jaw and the temporal muscle to the spheno-maxillary fossa, where it ends in branches for the face, the interior of the nose, and the palate and pharynx. At first the artery is directed inwards beneath the jaw, Course and between that bone and the internal lateral ligament of the ^o^^^^^^^"^- joint, and crosses the dental nerve. ISText, the vessel winds over the external pterygoid muscle, being placed between it and the temporal muscle. And lastly, the artery enters the spheno-maxillary fossa between the processes of origin of the external pterygoid muscle. The trunk of the artery may be divided into three parts : one beneath the jaw, a second between the muscles, and a third in the spheno- maxillary fossa. The course of the artery is sometimes Varies in its beneath, instead of over the external pterygoid muscle : P'^^^^^^^- in such instances the artery gains the spheno-maxillary fossa by coming upwards through the origin of the muscle covering it. The branches of this artery are very numerous, and are Branches classed into three sets, corresponding with the divisions sets!^^^^ made in the trunk of the artery : thus one set arises beneath the jaw, another beneath the temporal muscle, and another in the spheno-maxillary fossa. Two branches, viz. the inferior dental and middle menin- Those be- geal, leave the internal maxillary artery whilst it is ^^athjaw, connection with the ramus of the jaw. 1. The inferior dental branch descends between the inferior dental * mternal lateral ligament and the jaw, and enters the foramen * on the inner surface of the ramus, along with the dental nerve, to supply the teeth.

527 MESENTERIC AETERY AND VEm. destination. About two inches from their origin or sooner Number and the branches bifurcate, and the resulting pieces unite with mentin similar offsets from the collateral arteries so as to form a arches, series of arches. From the convexity of the arches other branches take origin, which divide and unite in the same way. This process is repeated four or five times between the origin and the distribution of the arteries, but at each branching the size of the vessels diminishes. From the last o^^th^g^t" set of arches twigs are sent to the intestine on both aspects of the tube, and anastomose round it supplying the structure. The branches io the large intestine are three in number, ileo- ^j^gg^g^t^^ colic, right colic, and middle colic arteries. a. The ileo-colic artery (6) arises from the right side of lieo-colic the mesenteric trunk. It descends to the caecum, and divides ^^'^^^^ into branches that encircle the head of the colon, as in the small intestine. A descending offset is distributed to the ^^^^ lower part of the ileum, the csecum, and the vermiform appendix ; whilst an ascending offset supplies the beginning of the ascending colon, and anastomoses with the right colic artery. h. The right colic artery (c) is commonly an offset of the ^^^^^j^g^^° preceding, instead of a separate branch from the trunk. Its pUes ascend- course is to the right or ascending colon. Near the intestine "^^ it divides into an ascending and a descending piece, and anastomoses with the ileo-colic artery on the one side, and the middle colic on the other. This artery gives ramifica- tions to the ascending colon. c. The middle colic branch (d) arises from the upper part of the superior mesenteric artery, opposite the transverse passes to meso-colon. Entering between the layers of that fold of transverse ... . . colou. the peritoneum, the vessel divides into two large diverging branches :—the right branch anastomoses with the artery to the ascending colon, and the left inosculates on the descend- ing colon with a branch (left colic (e)) of the iuferior mesen- teric artery. The intestinal twigs to the transverse colon are They form supplied from the two terminal pieces, but before entering the gut they are united in arches like those to the small intestine. The superior mesenteric vein (fig. 79, e) commences in that Superior part of the intestinal tube to which the artery is distributed, ^q^^^ and its radicles unite into one trunk. Thus formed, the vein accompanies the artery beneath the pancreas, and there joins the splenic vein to form the vena portoe. The mesenteric lymphatic glands are numerous between g{^^^g*®^^°

Stretched across the cavity is the fascia lata. Forming the deep boundary, or the floor, are the following parts, —the lower end of the pos- terior surface of the femur included between the lines to the condyles, the posterior ligament of the knee joint, and the popliteus muscle with the upper end of the tibia. The popliteal space is widest opposite the knee joint, where the muscles are most drawn to the sides, and is deepest above the articular end of the femur. In it are contained the popliteal vessels and their branches, and the ending of the external saphenous vein ; the popliteal divisions of the great sciatic nerve, and some of their branches ; together with lymphatic glands, and a large quantity of fat. The small sciatic nerve lies over fche space ; and a branch of the obturator is on the artery in the bottom of the hollow. The POPLITEAL ARTERY (fig. 104, ^) is the continuation of Popliteal the femoral trunk. It reaches from the opening in the adductor magnus to the lower border of the popliteus muscle ; and at this spot it terminates by bifurcating into Contents. * View of the popliteal space (from Quain's Arteries). 1.

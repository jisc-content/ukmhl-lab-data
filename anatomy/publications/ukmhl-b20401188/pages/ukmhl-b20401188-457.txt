437 SACRAL NERYES AND VESSELS. The first three nerves are covered by the multifidus First three spinse, and divide regularly. The inner branches of the nerves are distributed to the inner and multifidus ; and the last is very fine. The outer branches are larger in size, and have communi- outer eating oflsets from one to another on the back of the sacrum. > The outer branch of the first nerve is connected further with the corresponding part of the last lumbar ; and that of the third nerve joins in a similar manner the sacral nerve next below. After this looping the nerves pass outwards to the the last surface of the great sacro-sciatic ligament, where they join a second time, and then become cutaneous.—(See DissECTioisr offsets. OF THE Buttock.) Last two nerves.—These nerves, which are below the ■'^^^^ ^j^^^^^'*^ multifidus, are much smaller than the preceding, and want the regular branching of the others : they are connected by loops with each other, and with the coccygeal nerve, on the back of the sacrum. A few filaments are distributed to the back of the sacrum and the coccyx. The coccygeal nerve issues through the lower aperture Coccygeal of the spinal canal, and may be recognised with care by the side of the coccyx. It is joined by a loop from the last sacral nerve, and ends on the posterior surface of the coccyx. ^ Small Sacral Arteries leave the spinal canal with the Small sacral sacral nerves ; they supply the muscular mass of the erector spinse, and the structures on the back of the sacrum. Ana- stomoses take place between these vessels and the branches on the back of the sacrum from the gluteal and sciatic arteries. Dissection.—The examination of the posterior part of Dissection the wall of the thorax may be made before the body is again Muscles, turned. By the removal of the ilio-costalis and longissimus dorsi, opposite the ribs, the small levatores costarum will be uncovered. The hinder part of the external intercostal muscle will be denuded at the same time. The LEVATORES COSTARUM are twelve small fan-shaped Levatores muscles, which are connected with the hinder part of the extend from ribs. Each, except the first, arises from the apex and ^^^^^gg^g®^^ lower border of the transverse process of a dorsal vertebra ; S^!^^^^^ and is inserted, the fibres spreading out, into the upper border of the rib beneath from the tubercle to the angle. The muscles increase in size from above down, and their fibres have the same direction as the external intercostal layer. The first is fixed above to the transverse process of The first, the last cervical vertebra, and below to the outer surface of the first rib.

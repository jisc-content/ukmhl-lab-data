COmECTIONS OF THE BLADDER. 611 of tlie intestine is very much enlarged, especially in women Sometimes and old men ; and in that condition it rises up on each side, ' ^ and surrounds in the male the prostate, except above. The URINARY BLADDER (vesica urinaria) is situate in the Bladder is m pelvis (fig. 92, a), and is the receptacle for the fluid secreted by empty^^^^^ the kidneys. When the bladder is contracted it is of a triangular form, and lies within the pelvis against the an- terior wall of the cavity. But when distended it becomes of J^^^^^'^^f^g^^ a conical shape, with the larger part directed towards the full, rectum, and the apex to the abdominal wall; and it is slightly curved over the anterior part of the pelvis as it pro- jects beyond the bone. If a line through its centre were prolonged, it would touch the abdominal wall somewhere (according to the distension) betv/een the umbilicus and the pubes in the one direction, and the end of the coccyx in the other direction. The organ is maintained in its position by the recto-vesical fascia and the peritoneum, which form its ligaments (pp. 607, 609). For the purpose of studying its connections the bladder Divisions, is divided into the following parts :—a summit and base, and a body and neck. The summit or apex of the bladder is rounded, and from Apex has its anterior part three ligamentous cords are prolonged to ^^^^^^ the umbilicus; the central one of these is the remnant of the urachus ; and the two lateral are formed by the oblite- rated hypogastric arteries. If the bladder is full the apex is above, but otherwise below the pubes. All the surface behind the obliterated vessels is covered by peritoneum. The base (fundus) is large, and rests on the middle piece Base of the rectum. In the state of emptiness of the bladder the base is scarcely prominent; but in distension of the viscus, gj^^ape;^ this part extends lower, and becomes widened. Connected • . . loarts ill With the under part of the bladder are the vesiculse semi- contact with nales and the vasa deferentia ; and between these is a triangular space, from which the peritoneum is absent. Surfaces of the body.—The anterior part of the bladder surfaces; is in contact with the po^iterior surface of the symphysis ^i^tenor pubis, and with the lower part of the abdominal wall if it is distended, and is altogether free from peritoneum ; whilst the posterior surface is entirely covered by the serous and pos- membrane. terior. Extending along the upper part of each lateral region is Lateral the obliterated hypogastric vessel, and crossing it lower down is the vas deferens ; near the under part is the entrance of the ureter into the bladder.

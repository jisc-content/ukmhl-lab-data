THE PANCREAS. 557 surface, and the excretory duct contained in its substance be traced posteriorly from right to left. The duct will be recognised by its white colour. Structure.—The pancreas is a compound gland, and IS It is a provided with a special duct. Ifc is destitute of a <iistinct ^J^^^^^^'J^ capsule : but it is surrounded by areolar tissue, which pro- out a' ^ ' J r distinct capsule. jects into the interior, and connects together the lobules. The fluid secreted by it assists in the digestion of the ali- ment. The glandular structure is soft and loose in texture, and Texture and is of a reddish, or grayish white colour. It consists of ♦ lobules, which are united into larger masses by areolar tissue, vessels, and ducts. In analysincj a lobule it will be found constitution like the to consist ultimately, as in the parotid, of the branchings of salivary the excretory duct, which end in closed vesicular extremities, S^^^^^s. and are surrounded by a plexus of vessels. In the cells the epithelium is flattened. The duct of the pancreas (canal of Wirsung) extends the The ^^^^ entire length of the gland, and is somewhat nearer the lower ' than the upper border. It begins in the tail of the pancreas, extent; where it presents a bifurcated extremity ; as it continues * This cut shows the liver and gall bladder, the stomach raised, and the duodenum, pancreas, and spleen (Tiedemann).

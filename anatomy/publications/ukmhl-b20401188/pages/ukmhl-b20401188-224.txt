208 DISSECTIOIsr OF THE BKAIK cerebellum. Its fibres are white and longitudinal, and are collected into a bundle of a prismatic form. Superiorly most of the fibres enter the pons (fig. 32), to reach the cerebrum, but two offsets proceed from the outer side :— One is very small and superficial, and is directed below the Fig. 32.* corpus olivare to the restiform body and the cerebellum (fig. 31,/); the other blends with the fibres of the lateral tract, and invests the olivary body so as to be thickest on the sides, and enters the pons as the olivary fasciculus, or the fillet.

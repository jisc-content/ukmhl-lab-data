641 STRTJCTUEE OF THE PENIS. be made up of two masses of spongy and vascular tissue in" cased in fibrous coverings—one constituting the corpora cavernosa, the other the corpus spongiosum urethrse. Corpora cavernosa. —Each of the two corpora cavernosa is constructed of a fibrous tunic, which encloses a cavernous or trabecular structure with vessels in the intervals of the spongy mass. An incomplete median septum exists along the body of the penis between the corpora cavernosa. The fibrous case of the corpus cavernosum is a white, strong, elastic covering, from half a line to a line in thick- ness. Along the middle line of the penis a septal process is sent inwards from it ; and numerous other finer bands or trabeculse of the spongy structure are connected with its inner surface. It is formed of white shining fibres that are disposed in two layers, outer and inner. The outer stratum (fig. 95, h) is formed of longitudinal fibres with close meshes, arranged like involuntary muscular tissue.

The pectiniform septum. fThe existence of two strata—one longitudinal, the other ch'cular— is mentioned by Dr. James Wilson, in 1821, in his Lectures on the Genital and Urinary Organs. The fact has been overlooked by anato- mists since that time. T T

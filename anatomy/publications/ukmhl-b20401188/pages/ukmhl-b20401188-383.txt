363 VESSELS OF THE HEART. The veins of the substance of the heart (cardiac) are not Veins of the the same in number, nor have they the same arrangement as the arteries. There may be said to be three sets, but for the most part they are united into one large trunk, the coronary sinus, which opens into the right auricle. The corollary sinus (fig. 54, e), will be seen on raising the Coronary heart to be apparently the dilated ending of the great ^^^^^; Fig. 54.* coronary vein. The points in its anatomy will be better seen if it is opened with a scissors. About an inch usually extent; in extent, it is limited on the one side by two valves at the opening of the great coronary vein into it; and on the other side by a large valve (Thebesian), where it opens into the right auricle. It is crossed by the muscular fibres of the left structure; auricle. Inferiorly and at its inner termination it receives some branches from the back of the ventricles, whose openings are guarded by valves ; and nearly at its outer termination is another vein without a valve,â€”the oblique veins join- vein of Mr. Marshall, whicl^ ascends along the back of the left auricle. a.

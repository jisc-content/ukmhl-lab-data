The posterior aponeurosis of the transversalis, or the fascia Posterior ^ lumborum, is described in the dissection of the back, p. 420. '^P^^®^^'^^^^* Connections of the muscle.—Superficial to the transversalis Connections are the two muscles before examined ; and beneath it is the salismulcie. thin fascia transversalis, which separates it from the perito- neum. Its fleshy attachments to the ribs digitate with like processes of the diaphragm. The lower border is fleshy in the outer, but tendinous in the inner half, and is arched above the internal abdominal ring. Occasionally the muscle arises from Poupart's ligament as low down as the internal oblique, with which, and with the cremaster, it is then in- separably united. Dissection.—To remove the aponeurotic layer from the Expose ^ rectus muscle of the right side, make a longitudinal incision pyramidaiis. through the tendinous sheath, and turn it to each side. When the fascia is reflected, a small muscle, the pyramid?Jis, will be exposed near the pubes. The dissector should take care of the nerves entering the outer border of the rectus. On the left side of the body the rectus should not be laid Leave the bare below the umbilicus, for the sake of the hernia to be seen on this side. The RECTUS MUSCLE (fig. 72, ^'^) extends along the front ^^^^^J^ of the abdomen from the pelvis to the chest. The muscle is narrowest inferiorly, and is attached to the pubes by two Attach- tendinous processes ;—one. internal to the other and the pubest smallest, arises from the front of the symphysis, where it

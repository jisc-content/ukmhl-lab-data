DISSECTION" OF THE THOEAX. 410 has the width of the bones, and gives some curves to the spine. Constituent parts; the outer formed of lamiuse; how arranged; vertebrae, and it forms an almost circular disc between the bones. It is connected in front and behind witli the an- terior and posterior common ligaments, and on the sides with the stellate ligaments of the heads of the ribs. These masses are thicker between the lumbar and cervical, than between the upper dorsal vertebrae ; and where the spinal column is arched forwards, as in the loins and neck, they are deepest at the anterior edge. By means of the dissections before made, the interverte- bral substance may be observed to consist of two distinct parts ; an external, firm and laminar, and an internal, soft and elastic (fig. 63). The outer laminar part (fig. 63, ^) forms more than half of the disc, and is composed of a series of pieces of fibro- cartilage, alternating with layers of fibrous tissue. All the strata are arranged one within another, like the scales of an onion, and are connected by their edges to the bodies of the Fig. 62.* not vertical; vertebrae ; but all have not a vertical position, for the outer pieces are bent, so that their convexity is towards the surface (fig. 62, ^), and the inner are convex towards the centre of the disc (^). The laminae of the fibro-cartilage form com- plete rings less frequently than the layers of fibrous tissue. Each layer is constructed of oblique fibres ; and the fibres of one layer are directed across those of another like the parts of the letter X (fig. 61). This disposition of the fibres will be best seen on the discs between the lumbar vertebrae ; and it may be rendered evident by dissecting layer after layer. their fibres cross. * Vertical section of the intervertebral substance, showing the bent condition of the external layers.â€”1.

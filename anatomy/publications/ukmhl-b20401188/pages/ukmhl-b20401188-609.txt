589 COMMOIS; ILIAC ARTERY. remarkable for its small size in proportion to its length ; for J^^^^^^^^^^ leaving the cavity of the abdomen ; and for having the part in the abdomen straight, but that in the cord tortuous. From its origin below the renal, the vessel passes downwards ^j^^^^^^^^l^ along the posterior wall of the abdomen to the internal abdominal ring, where it enters the spermatic cord, as before described (p. 496). In its course beneath the peritoneum the vessel passes first along the front of the psoas, crossing over the ureter ; and as it leaves the abdomen it turns round the epigastric artery, but is separated from that vessel by the vas deferens. On the right side the artery crosses the vena cava. It is accompanied by the spermatic vein, and the spermatic plexus of nerves. In the fetus before the testicle leaves the abdomen the ^^^J^Jj^g^ spermatic artery is very short, but the vessel becomes elon- gated in proportion as the part supplied is removed from its former site. In the female the corresponding artery (ovarian) descends ^^^^^^ into the pelvis to the ovary and the uterus. B. The parietal branches of the aorta are the diaphragmatic, ^aif^oJ^aMo- lumbar, and the middle sacral arteries. men. The diaphragmatic or inferior phrenic arteries are directed Inferior upwards and outwards along the under surface of the diaphragm near the posterior part, and end in anastomotic and muscular branches. The left artery passes behind the f^JJ^and ^ oesophageal opening, and the right behind the vena cava, right. Each ends in two branches :—One (internal) j)asses onwards Distribu- towards the fore part of the diaphragm, and anastomoses with its fellow, and with the branches (musculo and superior phrenic) supplied to the diaphragm from the internal mam- mary (p. 274). The other (external) is larger, and is directed outwards to the side of the muscle, where it meets with the intercostal arteries. Branches.—Small offsets supplied to the suprarenal body Small off- by the external division of this artery are named superior capsular. Some twigs are given by the leff artery to the oesophagus, and by the right to the vena cava. The other parietal branches, viz., lumbar and middle sacral, are not learnt in this stage : the former will be seen after the lumbar plexus (p. 601), and the latter in the pelvis. The COMMON ILIAC ARTERY is directed outwards from the Common bifurcation of the aorta, and divides into two large trunks extent and opposite the fibro-cartilage between the base of the sacrum termina- and the last lumbar vertebra :—one of these supplies the

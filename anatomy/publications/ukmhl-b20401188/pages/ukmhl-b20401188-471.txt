ORIGIF OF THE NERVES. 451 Largest in the upper part of the dorsal region, the tract Size and ceases in the cervical enlargement of the cord. Above that ^^'^^^s- spot there is a collection of cells in a line with it, and seem- , . . T,.,. T,', AccessorjT ing to continue it upwards, which is traversed by the roots part, of the spinal accessory and the spinal nerves. h. The wliite substance of the cord is composed chiefly of ^^^^^ ^ ^ nerve fibres disposed longitudinally in bundles, so as to give the half of passage to intermediate vessels. By the projection of the cornua of the gray crescent towards the surface, each half of the cord is separated more or less completely into three parts—anterior, middle, and posterior, corresponding with the columns of the cord ; but the anterior and middle por- tions are united because the anterior cornu does not reach the surface. Modifications in the gray and ivhitc substance.—The white Gray and substance is most abundant in the neck and back; and the ^ance^vary. gray substance is more abundant in proportion to the white in the lumbar region. The cornua of the gray crescents decrease in length from Crescents above down, especially the posterior, and towards the end g^ape*^^^'^ of the cord they blend in one indented or cruciform mass. Origin of the Nerves. —The deep origin of the spinal Deep origin nerves is uncertain, like that of the cranial nerves, but the SnceSu. fibrils in each root enter the gray matter of the cord. "^^ The anterior root traverses the longitudinal fibres of the Anterior antero-lateral column in distinct bundles ; and entering the anterior cornu of the gray crescent, it is resolved into ^g^^'^^j^^^^" three sets of fibres, external, internal, and middle. ends in The outer set penetrate into the anterior and lateral ^0*^^^^ columns. The inner set pass through the anterior column to the anterior ° . column of anterior median fissure, and cross to the opposite half of other side,, tlfe cord, decussating with like fibres of the opposite side. The middle set enter the substance of the crescent, and and the are lost in it and the cells of the intermediate tract (fig. 69, % The posterior root pierces chiefly the posterior column of Posterior the cord, its fibres interlacing therein, and enters the pos- terior cornu of the crescent; but a few fibres penetrate by the enters lateral fissure. It terminates in two bundles of fibres, which crescent, are specially connected with the vesicular column. One bundle courses round the outer side of the vesi-and joins by * The description of the origin of the nerves embodies the opinions of Mr. Clarke.

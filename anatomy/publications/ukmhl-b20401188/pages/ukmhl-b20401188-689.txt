663 PUBIC SYMPHYSIS, there are a few scattered fibro-cartilaginous fibres, as in front, in contact with tlie cartilage. The superior ligamentous fibres are placed as their name Upper band, expresses. The subpubic ligament (ligam. arcnatum) is a strong tri- Subpubic angularly-shaped band below the symphysis (fig. 100, '•^), and ^^S"'^'^^^^- occupies the upper part of the pubic arch. Its fibres curve downwards, and are attached on each side to the bone. The apex of the ligament touches the articular cartilage, and the base is turned towards the membranous part of the urethra and the muscle around it. Cartilage.—This structure will be best seen by opening Cartilage, the articulation behind. A transverse section will also show ^^'"^ ^^^^^' the disposition of the anterior ligament of the articulation. The cartilage joins the bones in front, and is firmly fixed disposition to the ridged bony surfaces of the symphysis. It is larger pj^ygfs^"^"^" above than below, and is generally as thick again before as behind. Variations in size depend on the shape of the bones, and not on difierence in sex. Towards the posterior part of the cartilaginous mass a Hollow in hollow or narrow fissure is excavated with uneven walls and a synovial-looking fluid ;^ and a fibrous structure with large interspersed compound cells is to be recognised in its wall. This space varies in size. It extends usually the Variations in whole depth of the cartilage. In some bodies it reaches through the whole thickness from before back so as to divide the mass into two collateral pieces ; in others it projects through only a half or a third of the cartilage. * This hollow is said to increase in pregnancy.

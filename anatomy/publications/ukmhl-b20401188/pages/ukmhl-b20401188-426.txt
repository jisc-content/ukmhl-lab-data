Middle tilage, wMcli is attached on one side to the ridge separating the articular surfaces on the head of the rib, and on the other to the fibro-cartilaginous substance between the ver- tebrse. In the first, eleventh, and twelfth ribs it is absent. Synovial sacs. —There are two sacs in the articulation, one on each side of the interarticular ligament, except in the three ribs before mentioned, where there is but one. B. Ligaments from the neck and tubercle of the rib.— Three ligaments (costo-transverse) pass from the neck and tubercle of the rib to the transverse processes. And there is one synovial sac between the rib and its transverse process. The anterior costo-transverse ligament (fig. 58, ^) is larger and longer than the others. It ascends from the upper border of the neck of the rib to the lower edge of the transverse process of the upper of the two vertebrae with which the head of the rib is connected : it is wanting in the first rib. Between this ligament and the vertebrae the posterior branches of the intercostal artery and dorsal nerve pass backwards ; and by the outer edge it is continuous with the fibrous mem- brane between the strata of the intercostal muscles. The posterior costo-transverse (fig. 65, ^) is placed at the posterior aspect of the rib. It is a short band of fibres between the tip of the transverse process and the rough part of the tubercle of the rib. This band is longest on the lowest two ribs. The middle or interosseous costo-transverse is placed hori- Fig. 59.* costo-trans- zontally between the neck of the rib and the transverse verse. process with which the tubercle articulates (fig. 59, I * The body of a dorsal vertebra and the inner end of a rib sa through horizontally, to show the uniting ligaments.—1.

EXTHmSIC LmGUAL MUSCLES. IGl Only the two parts of the hyo-glossas (basio and cerato- Ofhyo- glossus, p. 102), which arise from the body and great wing of the hyoid bone, are referred to above. To lay bare its third part, or the chondro-glossus, the other two portions of the nmscle must be cut through with the lingual vessels, and raised and shown entering the tongue. The origin of this small muscular slip, two or three lines in width, can be now seen close to the small cornu of the os hyoides, but it is con- cealed farther by some fibres of the genio-hyo-glossus that ascend to the upper constrictor ; and its radiation, near the upper surface of the tongue, will be prepared by taking the mucous membrane and the thin underlying muscular stratum from the remaining third of the dorsum. The part of the constrictor muscle that is attached to the Of constric- tongue, and the ending of the genio-hyo-glossus, come into ^^^^ ^' view through the division of the hyo-glossus. The potato and stylo-glossus are partly combined at their Combined attachment to the lateral jDart of the tongue, and form, styfo?'^^^ tocjether with the folio win muscle, an expansion that covers giossus; 11 •r.n ^ii 1 11 position aud the three anterior fourths of the dorsum beneath the super- extent. ficial lingualis. In this muscular stratum the fibres radiate Fibres, from the point of contact of the muscles with the tongue— some passing almost horizontally inwards to the centre, and others obliquely forwards to the tip of the organ. A great portion of the stylo-glossus is directed along the Rest of side of the tongue, and some fibres are inclined to the under gus^^"^^^^" surface in front of the hyo-glossus, to join those of the oppo- joins fellow, site muscle beneath the tip. Hyo-glossus.—The two superficial parts of the muscle Hyo-gios- (basio and cerato-glossus, p. 102) enter the under surface of the tongue, between the stylo-glossus and the lingualis. ^^^^^^^J?*^^'^^ After entering that surface by separate bundles, they are bent round the margin of the tongue, and form, with the two preceding muscles, a stratum on the dorsum, whose disposition and extent have been before stated. The third part of the muscle, or the chondro-glossus, is Deeper part distinct from the rest at its origin, and is separated from giossus, them higher up by a slip of the genio-hyo-glossus, and by the lingual vessels. About two or three lines wide at its origin from the root of the small cornu, and from part of the origin, body of the os hyoides, the muscle is directed upwards and connections forwards to the root of the tongue beneath the hinder fibres of the genio-hyo-glossus. In entering the tongue the fibres ending in spread out beneath the upper lingualis, passing obliquely in- ^0^8^^- wards and forwards over the posterior third of the dorsum, M

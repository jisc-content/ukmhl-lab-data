CILIARY VESSELS AND JSTERYES. 789 branches, but some come from the vessels of the ciliary pro- cesses. On arriving at the ciliary muscle the long ciliary arteries form a circle around the margin of the iris ; from this loop other anastomotic branches are dii ected towards and looped, the pupil, near which they terminate in a second arterial circle, and end in small veins. The nerves of the iris divide into branches, which com- Nerves of ^municate and extend towards the pupil; they are v/ithout dark outline, and their ending is not known. Membrane of the pupil.-—In the fetus before the seventh Membrane month the aperture of the pupil is closed by a "vascular ?^ P^^^^^^ transparent membrane. This structure is attached to the anterior surface of the iris, over the situation of the inner Situation; vascular circle, and divides into two distinct chambers the space in which the iris is suspended. Yessels shoot into it from the circle before referred to, and communicate across the middle line ; but at about the eighth month the vessels time of dis- become impervious, and at the time of birth only fragments ^ppearanco. of the membrane remain. Ciliary Yessels and Nerves.—The ciliary arteries are Arteries of offsets of the ophthalmic (p. 48), and supply the choroid coat, the ciliary processes, and the iris. They are classed into posterior and anterior ; and two of the iirst set are named long ciliary ; but they will not be seen without a special injection of the vessels of the eye. The posterior (short) ciliary branches (fig. 121) pierce the posterior at sclerotic coat around and close to the optic nerve, and run- ' ning on the surface of the choroid membrane enter its sub- stance. Two of this set (long ciliary) are directed forvv^ards two of them to the ciliary ligament, one on each side of the eyeball, and ciiSry.^^^^^ form a circle around the iris in the ciliary muscle, as before explained, before being distributed in it. In the eye the outer one lies rather above, and the inner rather below the level of the middle of the ball The anterior ciliary arteries are smaller than the posterior, Anterior and arise at the front of the orbit, chiefly from muscular thg^f^p^ branches ; they pierce the sclerotic coat about a line behind the cornea, and join the arterial circle of the long ciliary vessels before they end in the iris. In inflammation of the iris these vessels are enlarged, and form a ring around the cornea. The veins leaving the choroid coat are commonly four in Veins end in number, and the branches entering these trunks form arches ^^^®^^^P^^^^^^" (vasa vorticosa) on the surface (fig. 121,/): they perforate the sclerotic layer at separate points, midway between the

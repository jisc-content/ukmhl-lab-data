THE UTERUS. 651 Glands of Bartholine.â€”On the outer part of the vagina, Two glands near the aperture at the lower end, are two small yellowish bowper's. glandular bodies, one on each side, which represent Cowper's glands in the male. Each is a branched mucous gland, about as large as a small bean. Its duct is directed forwards to open on the inner aspect of the nympha of the same side. The duct resembles that of Cowper's gland in its ramifica- tions and structure (p 468). THE UTEEUS. The uterus or womb is formed chiefly of unstriped mus- Uterus, cular fibres. Its ofiice is to receive the ovum and retain for a fixed period the developing fetus. This viscus in the virgin state is pear-shaped, or rather Form ; triangular in consequence of the body being flattened (fig. 99), and presents inferiorly a rounded narrow part or neck. Deviations from the standard shape are seen in the infant, how where the neck is larger than the body ; and in the aged female, in whom there is little separation between the same two parts. Commonly the uterus measures about three inches in Dimensions, length, two in breadth at the upper part, and an inch in greatest thickness. Its weight varies from an ounce to an ounce and a half. But after gestation its size and volume exceed always the measurement here given.

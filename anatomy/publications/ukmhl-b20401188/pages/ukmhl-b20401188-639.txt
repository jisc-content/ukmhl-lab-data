VESSELS AND ISTERYES OF THE PELVIS. 619 and in tlie virgin state of the part, the external aperture is Lower end closed by the hymen. The vagina is surrounded by a large dosed, plexus of veins. The Bladder is placed at the anterior part of the pelvis, Bladder above the vagina and in contact with the back of the pubes. Its form, position, and connections so closely resemble those of the bladder in the male body, as to render unnecessary resembles any repetition (see p. 611). The chief differences in the maie°*^^^ bladder of the two sexes are the following :— In the female the bladder is larger than in the male, and P^^j^^'®^^^^ its transverse exceeds its vertical measurement. The base is sexes, of less extent; it is in contact with the vagina and the lower part of the uterus; and it does not project below the level of the urethra, so as to form a pouch as in the male. On the side of the viscus there is not any vas deferens ; and the prostate does not project around the neck. The ureter has a longer course in the pelvis of the female Course of than in that of the male before it reaches the bladder. After ^^'^ crossing the internal iliac vessels, it passes by the neck of the uterus ere it arrives at its destination. The urethra is a small narrow tube about one inch and a Urethra ; half long, which curves slightly below the symphysis pubis, form^ ^^^^ the concavity being upwards. Its situation is above the vagina, and its external opening is placed within the vulva. In its course to the surface it is imbedded in the tissue of ^°th^parts^ the vaginal wall, and perforates the triangular ligament of around, the perinyeum ; but it is surrounded by the muscular fibres of the constrictor and orbicularis urethree (p. 474). A plexus of veins surrounds the urethra as well as the vagina. Section IV. VESSELS AND NERVES OF THE PELVIS. This section is to be used by the dissectors of both the male and female pelvis. In the pelvis are the internal iliac vessels, and their Vessels am nerves oi branches to the viscera ; the sacral plexus and its nerves ; the pelvis, and the sympathetic nerve, consisting of both a gangliated cord and offsets of the hypogastric plexus. Directions.—The internal iliac vessels are to be dissected on the right side. But the air should be previously let out

VALVULE COmiYENTES. 549 velvet. Occupying the substance of the mucous coat are and villous numerous glands ; and covering the whole is a columnar epithelium. The vahulce conniventes (valves of Kerkring) are perma- Folds or nent folds of the mucous membrane, which are arranged arrange- circularly along the intestine, and project into the alimen- tary mass. Crescentic in form, they extend round the length, intestine for half or two-thirds of its circle, and some end in bifurcated extremities. Larger and smaller folds are met size and with, sometimes alternating; and the larger are about ' two inches long, with one-third of an inch in depth towards the centre. Each valve is formed of a doubling of the how mucous membrane, which encloses vessels between the layers. ^ The little valves begin in the duodenum, about one or ^Jl^^^^^^^g^^ two inches beyond the pylorus, and are continued in regular tine, succession to the middle of the jejunum ; but beyond that pqint they become smaller and more distant from one another, and finally disappear about the middle of the ileum, having previously become irregular and rudimentary. The valvulse are largest and most regular beyond, and not far from the opening of the bile duct. The aperture of the common bile and pancreatic ducts is a ^.y®^"^^?^ narrow orifice, from three to four inches from the pylorus, and is situate in a small prominence on the mucous mem- sitlTafe. brane at the inner and posterior part of the duodenum. A probe passed into the bile duct will show the oblique or valvular course (half an inch) through the wall of the intestine. Sometimes the pancreatic duct opens by a dis- tinct orifice. Microscopic structure of the mucous membrane,—With, ^^^^^^p"^^ ■'■ . . c f 1 ' ' learnt m the the use of the microscope, and with pieces of fresh intestine, intestine, the student will be able to make out the nature of the villi, the glandular bodies, and the epithelium. Villi.—When a piece of the lower part of the duodenum, The villi from which the mucus is washed away, is examined in surface ;^ water, the mucous membrane will be found studded over very thickly with small projections, like those on velvet. Existing along the whole of the small intestine, both on the valves and between them (fia:. 82), these bodies are irregular their shape, . „ \ & /? _ T f • 1 and size, m lorm, some being triangular, others conical or cylindrical with a large end. Their length is from J^th to -^^^th of an inch. They are best marked where the valvulse conniventes are largest ; and in the duodenum their number is estimated ^^^^^^^ at 50 to 90 in a square line, but in the lower end of the ileum at only 40 to 70 over the same surface.—Krause.

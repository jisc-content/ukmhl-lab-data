EXTEH^TAL MUSCLES OF TIJE LEG. 757 The anterior tibial nerve (interosseous) is directed inwards Anterior beneath the extensor longus digitorum (fig. 109) and reaches the artery?^ the tibial artery about the middle of the leg. From this spot it takes the course of the vessel along the foot to the first interosseous space, in which it ends on the surface (p. 749). In the leg it crosses the anterior tibial artery once or more, but its position on the foot is generally external to the dorsal artery. Branches. — In the leg the nerve supplies the anterior Branches to tibial muscle and the extensors of the toes. On the dorsum ^^^^cles. of the foot it gives a considerable branch to the short ex- tensor ; this becomes enlarged, and gives oflfsets to the articulations of the foot. Muscles on the outer part of the leg. —Only two External muscles are found in this situation; they are named peronei tue^ieg^ from their attachment to the fibula, and are distinguished by terms (longus and brevis) expressive of their relative length. Intermuscular processes of fascia, which are attached to the fibula, isolate these muscles from others, viz., from the soleus and flexor poUicis behind, and from the extensor longus digitorum in front. The PERONEUS LOKGUS is the more superficial of the tw^o Peroneus muscles, and passes into the sole of the foot round the outer border to end in the cuneiform and metatarsal bones. It ^'"^^^^ ^[°'? arises from the head of the fibula ; from the outer surface of ' the shaft of the bone for about two thirds of its length, but still farther from the posterior border ; and from the fascia and the intermuscular septa. Inferiorly it ends in a tendon which is contained, v/ith that of the peroneus brevis, in the groove at the back of the external malleolus, and in the sheath of the external annular ligament. Afterwards the tendon is continued in a separate sheath, below the peroneus brevis, along the side of the os calcis and through the groove in the outer border of the cuboid bone, to the sole of the foot. Its position in the foot, and its insertion into the l^^^^^^^j^^g tarsal and the metatarsal bones, are described before (p. 747). Jf the foot. In the leg the muscle is immediately beneath the fascia, Position in and lies on the peroneus brevis. Beneath the annular liga- ment it is placed over the middle piece of the external lateral ligament of the ankle with the peroneus brevis, and is surrounded by a single synovial membrane common to both. The extensor longus digitorum and the soleus muscles are fixed to the fibula laterally with respect to it, one being on each side. The PERONEUS BREVIS rcaches the outer side of the foot^ Peroneus

171 yOCAL CORDS OF THE LAEYI^X. The laryngeal pouch (sacciilus laryngis) (fig. 22, s) will Poucii of be best seen by removing, still on the right side, the thyro- '^^^^^* arytsenoid muscle, and some fibrous tissue that covers it. Form and It is a small membranous sac, half an inch deep and cylin-1^^^^^^^"- drical in form, which projects upwards between the thyro- arytsenoid muscle and the upper vocal cord, and reaches sometimes as high as the upper border of the thyroid carti- lage. Its cavity communicates with the front of the ventricle by a narrow aperture, provided mostly with two folds of mucous membrane. On the outer surface are numerous Surrounding small glands, whose ducts are transmitted through the coats P^^*^- of the sac to the inside. Numerous nerves are distributed over the sac. Its upper part is covered by the muscular slip before referred to (p. 168). Dissection.—The mucous membrane should be removed Dissection, on the right side from the two whitish bands of the vocal cords (thyro-arytsenoid ligaments), which bound the ventricle of the larynx above and below. Then the lateral crico- arytoenoid muscle, and any fibres that may remain of the thyro-arytaenoideus should be taken away. The thyro-arytoinoid ligaments, or the vocal cords (fig. 22), Thyro-ary- are two bands on each side, which are extended from the meuts^ angle of the thyroid to the arytsenoid cartilage,—one form- ing the upper, the other the lower margin of the ventricle ; they are about seven lines long in man, and two less in the woman. a. The inferior ligament (chorda vocalis) (fig. 22, r), is Inferior or the upper free edge of the crico-thyroid ligament : it is ^^^^ composed of fine elastic tissue, and is almost transverse in direction. Attached in front to the angle of the thyroid cartilage, about half way down below the notch, the fibres of the ligament are directed backwards parallel to one another, and are inserted into the anterior prominence at the base of the arytsenoid cartilage. Internally this band has these is covered only by thin mucous membrane, and projects connections, towards its fellow into the cavity of the larynx, the interval between it and the opposite one being the glottis ; externally it is connected with the thyro-arytaenoid muscle ; and in- feriorly it is continuous with the crico-thyroid ligament. The edge that bounds the ventricle is straight and well defined, and vibrates to produce sounds. h. The upper ligament (false vocal cord) (fig. 22) is semi- Upper liga- lunar in form, and is much weaker than the preceding one. ^^^^ It is fixed in front to the angle of the thyroid cartilage, near the attachment of the epiglottis ; and behind to the

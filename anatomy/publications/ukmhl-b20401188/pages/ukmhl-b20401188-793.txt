ARTICULATIOISr OF THE ANKLE. 767 connected externally to the pit on the inner surface of the malleolus, and is inserted into the posterior part of the Fig. 114.* astragalus behind the articular surface, extending to the groove for the flexor proprius pollicis tendon. The posterior and middle fasciculi are in contact with the Connec- peronei muscles. The middle part is but slightly in contact above with the synovial membrane of the ankle joint ; and both it and the posterior piece touch the synovial membrane between the astragalus and the os calcis. Dissection.—Dividing the ligaments of the ankle joint. Open the separate the astragalus from the bones of the leg, to see the ^'^"^^^ j^^^*- osseous surfaces entering into the joint. Articular surfaces.—On the tibia there are two articular Surfaces of faces, one of which corresponds with the end of its shaft, and the other with the malleolus ; but on the fibula only the surface of the malleolus which is turned to the astragalus, is tipped with cartilage. The astragalus has a central articular surface, v/hich touches the end of the tibia : and on the sides are articular impressions for contact with the malleoli, but the outer one is the largest. in tlie joint. * External lateral ligament of the ankle (altered from Bourgery). —1. Anterior part. 2. Posterior part. 3. Middle part of the outer ligament. 4. Interosseous of astragalus and os calcis. 5. Extercal calcaneo-scaphoid ligament.

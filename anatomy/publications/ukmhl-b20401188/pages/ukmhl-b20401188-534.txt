DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN. 514 Parts in Contents and their loosition.—The alimentary tube and its cavity. accessory parts, the liver, pancreas, and spleen, occupy the upper division of the cavity of the abdomen. The kidney is situate also in the same part of the abdominal space. General The alimentary tube presents differences in form, and is aiimeut'iry ^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^ stomacli, small intestine, and large intestine ; tube. and each of these portions is further subdivided as it will afterwards appear. The several viscera have the following general position :— Position of The small intestine is much coiled, and occupies the parts^^^^ greater part of the cavity ; whilst the great intestine arches around it. Both are fixed in position by folds of the serous lining. Above the arch of the great intestine are situate the stomach, the liver, the s^jleen, and the pancreas ; and below it is the convoluted small gut. Behind the large in- of kidney, testine on each side is the kidney with its excretory tube. Parts of Superficial view of the contents.—On first opening the | wiThout^^^^ abdomen the following viscera appear :—On the right side I displace- Is the liver, which is partly concealed by the ribs. On the [ ment. ^^^q ^ ^^j,^ q£ stomach is visible ; but this viscus I lies for the most part beneath the ribs, and is somewhat i overlaid by the liver. Descending from the stomach is a fold of peritoneum (the large omentum), which reaches to • the pelvis, and conceals the intestine. In some bodies the \ omentum is raised into the left hypochondriac region, and i leaves the small intestine uncovered. If the bladder is i distended, a small part of it may come into view just above | the pelvis. Connections Before the natural position of the viscera is disturbed, to be seen "tl^^ir connections with the surrounding parts, and their situation in the different regions of the abdomen should be examined. CONNECTIONS OF THE VISCEKA. Position of The stomach (fig. 83).—The stomach intervenes between the gullet and the small intestine, and is retained in position partly by folds of the serous membrane. It is somewhat of a conical form, with the larger end to the left side ; and it occupies the left hypochondriac, the epigastric, and part of the right hypochondriac region. Extremities, At the left end it receives the oesophagus (fig. 83, ^) by large which it is firmly fixed to the diaphragm. Its large end lies beneath the ribs, and is in contact with the spleen, to which it is connected by a fold of peritoneum (splenic omentum) : when this part of the stomach is distended it

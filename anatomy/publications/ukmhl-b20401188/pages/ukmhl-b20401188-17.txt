DEMONSTEATIONS OF ANATOMY. CHAPTEE I. DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. Section I. EXTERNAL PARTS OF THE HEAD. Directions.—In the dissection of the head and neck, the Parts to be student should endeavour to learn the anatomy of the parts thTbody is described in the first sixty pages before the first position of turned, the body is changed ; but should want of time necessitate an omission of some part, the examination of the facial nerve (p. 38) can be best deferred till a subsequent stage. The orbit on one side, and the posterior triangular space on both sides of the neck, as well as the objects on the exterior and interior of the head, should be examined whilst the body lies on the back in its first position. Fosition.—The student may begin with the dissection of Position of the scalp and the muscles of the ear. To obtain the best position, raise the head to a suitable height, and turn it to the right side. On the left side the muscles are to be seen, and on the opposite half the vessels and nerves are to be displayed. Extrinsic muscles of the Ear.—Three muscles attach Muscles of the outer ear to the side of the head. Two are above it, ^^^* one elevating, the other drawing it forwards ; and the third, a retrahent muscle, is behind the ear. There are other special or intrinsic muscles of the cartilage of the ear, which will be afterwards described.

553 FORM OF THE LARGE mTESTlNE. five or six feet,—one fifth of the whole extent of the intes- tinal tube. The diameter of the colon is largest at the com- size, mencement in the ctecum, and gradually decreases from that part as far as the rectum, where there is, however, a dilata- tion near the end. When compared with the small intestine, the colon is Compared found to be distinguished by the following characters :—it ^^^^^ is of greater capacity, being in some parts as large again, larger; and is more fixed in its position. The large intestine is also "^^^'^ > . ^ • 1 1 P • ^ot coiled, free from convolutions, except m the left mac lossa where it forms the sigmoid flexure. Instead of being a smooth cylin- drical tube, the colon is sacculated ; and it is marked by Sacculated three longitudinal muscular bands, which alternate with as ^^^^ bands, many rows of dilatations. Attached to the surface at inter- Append- vals, especially along the transverse colon, are processes of peritoneum containing fat,—the appendices epiploica?. In the rectum, or the lower part of the large intestine, the Tn t^e surface is smooth, and the longitudinal bands have disappeared. Dissectiofi. —For the purpose of examining the large intes- Take pieces tine the student should select and blow up the CJecum, with intestine.^ part of the ileum entering it ; he should prepare also in a similar way a piece of the transverse colon, and a piece of the sigmoid flexure (about four inches of each). The areolar tissue and the fat are to be removed with care from each, after it has been inflated. The OJSCUM, or the head of the colon (caput caecum coli) Defmitiou of is the rounded part of the large intestine which projects, in the form of a pouch, below the junction of the ileum with it. It measures about two inches and a half in length, and ^J^^^.^.^^^ though gradually narrowing inferiorly, the csecum is the widest part of the colon,—hence the name caput coli. At its inner side it is joined by the small intestine ; and still receives ^ lower there is a small worm-like projection—the vermiform appendix, appendix. Appendix vermiformis.—This little convoluted projection Vermiform is attached to the lower and hinder part of the caecum, of attSi^^^ which it was a prolongation at one period in the growth of » the embryo. From three to six inches in length, the appen- dimensions, dix is rather larger than a goose-quill, and is connected to the inner part of the csecum by a fold of peritoneum. It is hollow, and has an aperture of communication with the It is hollow, intestine. In structure it resembles the rest of the colon. Dissection.—To study the interior of the caecum, and the Dry the valve between it and the small intestine, the specimen now opc^Tt to^^ under examination should be dried. After the caecum has

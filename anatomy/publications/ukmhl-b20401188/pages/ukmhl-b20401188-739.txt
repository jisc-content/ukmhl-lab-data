713 EXTERNAL ROTATOR MUSCLES. Dissection.—To see the remaining small rotator muscles. Clean lota- liook aside the great sciatic nerve, and take away the branches °^ ^^^^^^ of the sciatic artery if it is necessary. In cleaning these muscles the limb should be rotated inwards. The gemelli are to be tui'ned aside from the tendon of the obturator internus. The SUPERIOR GEMELLUS is the highest of the two mUS- Superior cular slips along the sides of the tendon of the obturator muscle. Internally it is attached to the outer and lower part of the ischial spine, and externally it is inserted with the ob- turator into the great trochanter. Oftentimes this muscle is absent. The INFERIOR GEMELLUS is larger and more constant than inferior its fellow. Its origin is connected with the upper and hinder part of the ischial tuberosity along the lower edge or lip of the hollow for the obturator internus muscle, and its insertion inserted is the same as that of the obtiirator tendon. This muscle is ^^^^ rator. placed between the obturator internus and quadratus muscles, but near the femur the tendon of the obturator externus comes into contact with its lower border. The OBTURATOR INTERNUS ariscs inside the pelvis (p. 658), Obturator and passes to the exterior through the small sacro-sciatic p^i^uSSde^^ notch. Escaped from the pelvis, the muscle is directed out- wards over the articulation of the hip, and is inserted by a tendon with the gemelli into the upper part of the great and part trochanter, in front of the pyriformis, as well as into the peMg f contiguous portion of the neck of the femur. Outside the pelvis the obturator is mostly tendinous, and latter part is embraced by the gemelli muscles ; beneath it is a synovial joint, sac. Crossing the muscle are the large and small sciatic nerves, and the sciatic vessels ; and covering the whole is the gluteus maximus. On cutting through the tendon and ^^^^^^^^^^ raising the inner end, it will be found divided into four or on the edge five pieces as it turns over the margin of the pelvis : at this ^l^^^ spot the pelvis is marked by ridges of fibro-cartilage, that correspond with the intervals between the tendons, and the whole is lubricated by a synovial membrane. The QUADRATUS FEMORis has the form expressed by its Quadratus name, and is situate between the inferior gemellus and the ^ ' adductor magnus. Internally it arises from the outer border of the tuber ischii, along the side of the origin of the semi- origin; membranosus and adductor magnus ; externally it is inserted insertion; into the linea quadrati of the upper end of the femur, above the attachment of the great adductor to the same line. By one surface it is in contact with the sciatic vessels and parts above

CUTANEOUS NERVES. 305 median receives a communicating brancli from a vein accom- panying the artery beneath the fascia. Cutaneous Nerves.—The superficial nerves of the fore- Superficial arm are continued from those of the arm, viz. on the inner forearm side from the large internal cutaneous nerve ; and on the outer side from the two external cutaneous nerves derived from the musculo-spiral, and from the musculo-cutaneous. Occasionally there is a small ofiset of the ulnar nerve to the integument of the fore part of the limb. On the back of and back of the hand is the termination of the radial nerve, together with a branch of the ulnar nerve. The internal cutaneous nerve was seen in a previous dis- internal section to be divided into two parts. The anterior branch (Fig.43, ^) extends on the front of the forearm as far as the wrist, and supplies the integuments on the inner half of the anterior surface. Near the wrist it communicates sometimes with a cutaneous olfset from the ulnar nerve. The posterior branch (Fig. 42, ^) continues along the back of the forearm (ulnar side) to rather below the middle. The cutaneous part of the musculo-cutaneous nerve (Fig, musculo or 43, is continued from the arm along the radial border of the cutaneous • limb to the ball of the thumb, on which it terminates in cutaneous offsets. Near the wrist the nerve is placed over the radial artery, and some twigs pierce the fascia to ramify on the vessel. A little above the middle of the forearm the nerve sends backwards a branch in the integuments of the posterior aspect nearly to the wrist, and communicates with the radial nerve as well as with the following cutaneous nerve. The external cutaneous branch of the musculo-spiral nerve external (Fig. 42, ^^), after passing the elbow, turns to the hinder part muscuio^^^^ of the forearm, and reaches as far as the wrist. Near its spiral, termination it joins the preceding cutaneous nerve. The radial nerve ramifies in the integument of the back of ^'^^^^^•^f the hand (Fig. 42, ^), and in that of the thumb and the next nerve two fingers. It becomes cutaneous at the outer border of the forearm in the lower third, and after giving backwards some filaments to the posterior aspect of the limb, divides into two branches a. One (external) is joined by the musculo-cutaneous by external nerve, and is distributed to the radial border and the ball of the thumb. 5, The other branch (internal) supplies the remaining side {JJ^^^j^^^ of the thumb, both sides of the next two digits, and half the ^^"^^ '

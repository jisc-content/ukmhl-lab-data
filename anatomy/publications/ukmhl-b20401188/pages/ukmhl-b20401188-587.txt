The next sized branches formed by the sublobular twigs, and ceasing to receive any intralobular veins, merely unite with neighbouring branches to produce larger trunks. Finally, the hepatic veins are directed from begin in the before backwards to the vena cava inferior, into which they ^^^^^es, open by large orifices. The vena3 cavse hepaticse may be and end in said to be without a sheath, for this is very slight only in ^^^a^^^^^^ the larger trunks: so that when they are cut across the ends remain patent in consequence of their close connection with the hepatic structure. Hepatic duct (fig. 86, d).—The duct commences within Biie duct, the lobules by radicles corresponding with the spaces between the rows of cells. On leaving the lobules the ducts com- municate here and there between them; and the small ducts soon unite into larger vaginal branches, which lie in the portal canals with the other vessels. Lastly, the ducts are collected into a right and a left trunk, and leave the liver at the transverse fissure as before described. Som.e ducts exist between the pieces of the peritoneum in Aberrant the left lateral ligament of the liver, and in a few other spots ; they anastomose together, and are accompanied by branches of the vessels of the liver, viz., vena portse, hepatic artery, and hepatic vein. structure.—The larger hepatic ducts consist of a fibrous coat lined by a mucous layer with cylindrical epithelium and branched glands ; and some of the glands are arranged in a row on each side. In the smallest ducts the epithelium becomes flattened. THE GALL BLADDEE. The gall-bladder (fig. 84, g) is the receptacle of the bile. Use and It is situate in a depression on the under surface of the right ^^^^^^^^^^ lobe of the liver, and to the right of the square lobe. Conical in form, or pear-shaped, its larger end {fundus) is ^"^'^' directed forwards beyond the margin of the liver ; whilst the smaller end, or the neck, is turned in the opposite direction, and bends downwards to end in the cystic duct by a zigzag part. In length the gall-bladder measures three size; or four inches, and in breadth rather more than an inch at the fundus or the widest part. It holds rather more than an ounce. By one surface the sac is in contact counec- with the liver, and on the opposite it is covered by peritoneum. The larger end touches the abdominal wall

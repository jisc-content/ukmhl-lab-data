The chief bond of union between the bones is a strong fibro- cartilage ; but a kind of capsule consisting of scattered fibres, capsule surrounds loosely the end of the ulna.

Dissection.—The articulation of the carpal bones will be J^^^J^^^^^j^^ prepared by taking away all the tendons from the hand, and cleaning carefully the surface of the connecting ligamen- tous bands between the several bones. To the pisiform bone there are distinct ligaments. At the same time the ligamentous bands uniting the meta- carpal with the carpal bones and with one another should be joints, dissected.

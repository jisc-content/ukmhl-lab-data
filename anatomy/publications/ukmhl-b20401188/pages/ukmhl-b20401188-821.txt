At the bottom of the eyeball, opposite the optic nerve, the mem- Process brane is also closely connected to the parts around. At "jfreous this spot in the fetus it was reflected inwards, through the mass, centre of the vitreous mass, along the bloodvessels supplying the back of the lens. This membrane and the vitreous mass are extra-vascular, How and receive their nutritive material from the vessels of the ^o^^^^^^^- ciliary processes and retina. Suspensory ligament of tJie lens (Retzius). —This is a Suspensory transparent membranous structure (fig. 117, placed around l^^^"^®^*- the lens at the front of the hyaloid membrane, and between Extent; the anterior termination (ora serrata) of the retina and the lens capsule. After the ciliary processes of the choroid coat are detached from it, dark lines of pigment cover the sur- marked face ; and when these are washed away plaits or folds, ^7 ^^^^^ ciliary processes, come into view, which resemble the processes called ciliary of the choroid coat, but are less prominent and longer. The P^^'^®^^®^- two sets of folds are dovetailed together, the prominences of one membrane being received into hollows on the other; and thus the membrane gains a fixed point for supporting the Nature and lens. In this membrane are stifi" longitudinal and elastic fibres. Canal of Petit.—Around the margin of the lens is a small Canal of canal (fig. 117, ^) about one tenth of an inch across, which has received the above name. Ifc is situate between the situation, plaited part of the suspensory ligament and the front of the hyaloid membrane—being the interval of separation between the two. When the canal has been opened and distended Anterior with air, it is sacculated at regular intervals, like the large f^^^^^^^*^*^^^ intestine, in consequence of the inflation of the plaits of the anterior boundary. The margin of the capsule of the lens projects into the space. Crystalline lens and its capsule.—The crystalline lens Lensof tiie is situate behind the pupil of the eye (fig. 117, l), and acts ^y^^^^^- in bringing to a focus on the retina the rays of light passing through that aperture. The capsule is a firm and very elastic transparent case, Capsule of which is permeable to fluid, and closely surrounds the lens. It is seated in a hollow on the front of the vitreous body. Situation The anterior part projects towards the iris and the pupil ; tions^^^^^^*^ whilst the posterior is received in the vitreous body, to which it is inseparably united. The circumference of the case corresponds with the canal of Petit. Its anterior surface (fig. 117, ^) is free in the posterior Its anterior

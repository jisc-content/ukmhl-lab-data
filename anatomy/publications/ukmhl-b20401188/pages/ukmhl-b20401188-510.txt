Its depth will be indicated by a fatty layer between it and the transversalis. In raising the muscle towards the edge of the rectus, the student must separate with great care the lower fibres from those of the transversalis, with which they are often conjoined ; and must dissect out the trunks of the intercostal nerves and arteries, the last dorsal nerve, and the two branches of the lumbar plexus (ilio-hypogastric and ilio-inguinal) near the front of the crest of the hip bone.

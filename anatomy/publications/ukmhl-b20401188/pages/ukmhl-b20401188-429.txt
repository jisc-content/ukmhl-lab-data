409 LIGAMENTS OF THE YEKTEBR^. Fig. 60.* downwards, just the opposite of the anterior. In the neck it is loose, and extends all across the bodies of the vertebrae, whilst in the loins it is only a thin narrow band. Opposite the dorsal and lumbar intervertebral substance it is wider than at the bodies of the vertebrae ; and it sends off on each side a pointed process to be attached to the pedicle of the neural arch; so that the margins are zigzag or f/'|||,j|||lfW| attachment dentate in those regions of the spine. Its J^iliillllllllitS i and fibres are superficial and deep as in the anterior ligament, and are more closely united with the intervertebral substance than with the bone. One surface of the ligament is in contact with the dura mater ; and between the opposite surface and the vertebrae are large intraspinal veins. Dissection.—To see the intervertebral substance, the anterior and posterior common ligaments To see the must be taken away. One vertebra should be detached from vertebral the intervening fibro-cartilage to obtain a horizontal view of substance, this structure ; and two other vertebrae should be sawn vertically to see the difference in the consistence, and the arrangement of the laminae. The intervertebral substance (fig. 61, ^) is placed between inter- Fig. 61.t the contiguous surfaces of the bodies of the vertebrae, from vertebral the axis to the sacrum. Its width is determined by the substance * LumlDar vertebrae, with the posterior common ligament of the todies. f Intervertebral substance of the lumbar region.—1. A superficial lamina. 2. A deeper layen The difference in the direction of the fibres of the layers is seen.

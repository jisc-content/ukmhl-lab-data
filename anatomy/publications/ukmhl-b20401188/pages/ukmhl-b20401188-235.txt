219 BASE OF THE CEREBHUM. The jissure of Sylvius (s, s') is directed outwards between tlie Fissure of anterior and middle lobes, and branches externally into two ^y^'^^^^ parts, one of which passes before, and the other behind some small convolutions, to which the term island of Reil has been applied. At the inner extremity of the fissure is a narrowed part, where there is a subjacent band of white fibres (fasci- culus uncinatus) that connects the two lobes. Surrounding the cleft is the convolution of the Sylvian is sur- Jissure (f,f'), which is much bent as it makes the circuit ; it is a^^mro^i^^ joined internally by the convolutions in the fissure, and ^i°^> externally by convolutions on the outer surface of the hemi- sphere of the cerebrum. The island of JReil consists of five or six small, short con- and con- volutions, which lie in the Sylvian fissure, and are concealed convolu-^^ by the anterior and middle lobes in the natural condition of tions. the parts. These convolutions blend with the large convo- lution around the fissure. Fedunde of the cerebrum (crus cerebri, d).—This is a Cms cerebri large, white, stalk-like body, which reaches from the upper the under border of the pons to the under part of the cerebral hemi- part of sphere of the same side near the inner margin. Each is sphere, about three quarters of an inch long, and widens as it ap- proaches the cerebrum. Crossing its outer surface is the optic tract; and between the crura of opposite sides is the interpeduncular space, which contains the locus perforatus, the corpora albicantia, and the tuber cinereum. Structure,—The peduncle may be said to be formed by a Formed of continuation upwards of the longitudinal fibres of the pons J^^iJ^reg*^^^"'^^ (fig. 33), which enclose here a mass of gray matter between them. Dissection.—For the purpose of showing the structure of Dissection, the crus, say on the left side, the fibres continuous with the anterior pyramid should be cut across in the pons, and should be raised and carried forwards into the crus as far as the optic tract. In this proceeding the mass of gray matter (locus niger) will appear, and beneath it will be seen a second or deeper set of longitudinal fibres. The superficial fibres^ which form the under or free part I^^^^Y^fibres of the crus, are continued from the anterior pyramidal body. They are longitudinal in direction, and coarse in texture, and are directed upwards radiating to the cerebrum. The surface of the peduncle, which is composed of these fibres, form crust; is called the fasciculated portion, or the crust. The deeper fibres are also prolonged to the cerebrum, tieep fibres They are derived chiefly from the lateral and posterior

807 MUSCLES AND VESSELS OF THE TYMPANUM. In the recent bone the thin mucous membrane closes the Membrane interval between the crura of the stapes, and is attached to of stapes, the groove on their inner aspect. Muscles of the ossicles. — Three muscles which possess Three ^ ^ transversely striated fibres are in connection with the chain the ossicles, of bones; two of these are attached to the malleus, the other to the stapes. The tensor tympani (internal muscle of the malleus) is Tensor tym- contained in a special bony canal, which must be laid open a bouy^^ to see it completely. It is the largest and most distinct of <^anai. the muscles of the tympanum, and takes the shape of the containing tube. The muscle arises from the surface of its Origin, bony canal, also slightly in front from the cartilage of the Eustachian tube. Posteriorly it ends in a tendon which, contained in a sheath, is reflected over the end of the cocli- leariform process as over a pulley, and is inserted into the Insertion inner border of the handle of the malleus, near its base. It receives a special nerve from the otic ganglion. The stapedius is lodged in the canal hollowed in the inte- fjj^^^g^^^^^^.^® rior of the pyramid. Arising from the circumference of mid ^ ^^^^ the tube, the muscle ends superiorly in a small tendon; this issues from the pyramid, and, encased in a sheath, is inserted attached to into the neck of the stapes at the posterior part. stapes. Laxator tympani (external muscle of the malleus).—It is Laxator_ connected externally with the spinous process of the sphenoid bone; and its tendon, passing through the Glasserian fissure, is Origin, attached to the neck of the malleus above the processus gracilis. Iiisertion. Mucous membrane of the tympanum.—The mucous lining Lining of of the tympanic cavity adheres closely to the wail, and is ^^^r^^^"^* continuous with that of the pharynx through the Eustachian tube. It assists to form part of the membrana tympani, and of the secondary membrane in the fenestra rotunda, and is continued moreover into the mastoid cells through the aperture leading into them ; it is reflected also over the chain of bones and the muscles and ligaments. Its surface is covered with a ciliated epithelium. A layer of epithelium Epithelium, can be detached from the inner surface of the membrana tympani, in the same manner as a cuticular stratum may be separated on the outer side. Bloodvessels. —The arteries of the tympanum are fur- ^^tenes are -"^ branches or nished from the following branches of the external carotid, carotid, viz., internal maxillary, posterior auricular, ascending pha- ryngeal ; and some offsets come also from the internal carotid in the temporal bone. The veifis join the middle meningeal Veins, and pharyngeal trunks.

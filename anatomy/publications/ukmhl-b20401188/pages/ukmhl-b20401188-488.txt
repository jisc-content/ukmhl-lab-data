DISSECTION" OF THE PEKIN^UM. 468 Involuntary circular fibres surround the urethra from the bulb to the prostate within the constrictor muscle, and form a layer about -j^Qth. of an inch thick ; they are not fixed to bone, and are continuous behind with the circular fibres of Fig. 71.* from the the prostate and bladder. This layer is described com buib!^*^ monly as part of the constrictor, but its fibres are nofc trans versely striated as in that muscle. It is only a portion o the large involuntary orbicular muscle, of which the prostat is part, surrounding the beginning of the urethra, f Cowper's The glands of Cowper will be found by cutting throug the transverse muscle. They are situate belov/ the mem branous part of the urethra, one on each side of the middl line, and close behind the bulb. Situation, Each gland is about the size of a pea, and is made up o structure, many lobules ; and the lobules are composed of smal vesicles, which are lined by flattened epithelium. Con Length and nected with each is a minute duct, nearly an inch in lensrth termination .

744 DISSECTION OF THE FOOT. Connec- The cutaneous surface is covered by the tendons, and the vessels and nerves of the toes ; and the opposite surface is in contact with the interossei muscles. Flexor The FLEXOR BREVIS MINIMI DIGITI is a Small naiTOW dig^tris like ^^^^-^^ j metatarsal bone of the little toe, and an inter- resembles one of the interossei. Attached to the metatarsal osseous. "bone, and to the sheath of the peroneus longus behind, it blends with the inferior ligament of the metatarso-phalangeal articulation, and is inserted with it into the base of the meta- tarsal phalanx of the toe. Dissect the Dissectio7i. —In order that the deep vessels and nerves may seis^and^' ^® seen, the flexor brevis and adductor poUicis are to be cut nerves. through at the posterior part, and thrown towards the toes; but the nerves supplying them are to be preserved. Beneath the adductor is the plantar arch, and the external plantar nerve, with their branches ; and in the first interosseous space is the part of the dorsal artery of the foot that enters the sole. All these vessels and nerves require careful clean- ing. The muscles projecting between the metatarsal bones are the interossei. plantar The PLANTAR ARCH is the part of the external plantar artery. artery tha,t reaches from the base of the metatarsal bone of the little toe to the back of the first interosseous space (p. 739): internally the arch is completed by a communi- cating branch from the dorsal artery of the foot.

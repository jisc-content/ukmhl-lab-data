THE IRIS. 787 inch thick, surrounds the iris, and is situate in the ball of the eye nearly opposite the junction of the cornea with the sclerotic tunic. It may serve the purpose of supporting the other coats at the fore part of the eye. Externally it is connections connected with the sclerotic, but a small interval the si7iics "^^^^ ^^^-^^^ ■' . parts. circidaris iridis exists between the two. Its fibres are cir- fibres, cular; they are stiff, and resemble those of elastic tissue in their properties. The ciliary muscle (^g. 121, 6) consists of unstriated fibres, ciliary mus- and forms a grayish layer, about -j'q th of an inch wide, on the surface of the choroid coat, close to the ciliary ligament. It is connected in front with the sclerotic coat, and the Attach- radiating fibres of the posterior elastic layer of the cornea ; meats, its fibres are directed backwards and inwards, and end on the choroid coat. At its origin the muscle conceals the cihary ligament. The nerves to the iris pierce its fibres.

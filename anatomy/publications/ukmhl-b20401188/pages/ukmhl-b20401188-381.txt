COMPOSITIOlSr OF THE HEART. 861 Component parts.—The heart is a double organ, and is ^^^^^^^^J^^ made up of two similar halves, right and left. In each half are two hollow portions, an auricle and a ventricle ; these communicate, and are provided with vessels for the entrance and exit of the blood. The right half receives black blood ^,?,f^ngln by the systemic veins, and sends the same to the lungs by aui icie and means of the pulmonary artery ; but the left half is supplied ^ with red blood from the lungs by the pulmonary veins, and distributes it over the body through the aorta. On the surface of the heart are certain grooves indicatory Grooves of this composition. Thus passing circularly round the pos^^^JJfof heart, nearer the base than the apex, is a groove which cuts off, as it were, the thin auricular, from the fleshy ventricular part. The auricular portion is placed at the base of the ^^^i^les organ, and is subdivided into two halves (right and left) by a median partition. In like manner the ventricular portion J^cies^" is parted into right and left ventricles by a septum. The situation of the median partition between the ventricles is recognised by a longitudinal sulcus on each surface : this tion be^^^" sulcus does not occupy the mid space either on the anterior tween or the posterior aspect, but is nearer the left border of the heart in front, and the right border behind ; so that most of the anterior surface is formed by the right, and the greater right most part of the posterior surface by the left ventricle. The auricles are two (right and left), as before said, and ^^^^^^J'^^ are placed so deeply at the base of the heart, behind the aorta tion of the and the pulmonary artery, that only the tip of the right one ^^"c^®^- comes forwards to the sternum. They receive their appella- tion from the resemblance that the tips or appendices, which project forw^ards on the sides of the arteries, bear to the dog's ears. The auricles are much thinner than the ven- ^^^J.^*'^^^ tricles, and are recipients of blood from large veins. Of the ties, two, the right is rather the larger and the more anterior ; Right, it is joined by the upper and the lower cava, and by veins from the substance of the heart. The left auricle receives i^®^^- the two pulmonary veins of each side. The ventricles constitute the fleshy part of the heart, and The ven- are thicker than the auricles, below which they lie. Two in municate number, like the auricles, each has an opening into the auricle ^|^gg^^" of its own side, by which it receives blood ; and another opening into an artery, by which the blood is transmitted from the cavity. Their unequal extent on the aspects of the heart has been before alluded to :—thus the right ven- "^^^ tricle forms the thin right border and the greater part of the anterior surface, and is prolonged upwards on the left

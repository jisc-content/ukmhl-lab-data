The stroma or web formed by the outrunners of the cells is very fine at the inner part of the choroid, and the pigment cells are absent from it. ciiiary^pro-^ ciliary processes there is also a texture of ramified cesses. bloodvessels though with larger capillary meshes ; and the intermixed pigment cells lose their colouring matter towards the tips of the folds, kyerform^ ^he pigmentary membrane (choroidal epithelium).—On the of cells Ciliary liga- ment. Situation. inner surface of the choroid coat and ciliary processes is a pigmentary lining. This struc- ture is easily detached. It consists ^ in great part of a single stratum of six-sided nucleated cells with granular contents (fig. 120, b), which are applied to each other by their edges. It has this constitu- tion as far forwards as the ciliary processes, but in front of that line it is several layers deep, and the cells are rounded. This dark layer absorbs the superabundant rays of light entering the eyeball. In the eye of the ox the colouring matter is absent from the cells in the bottom of the eye, and allows some fibrous tissue of the choroid {tapdum) to shine through it ; and in the albino the pigment is altogether deficient in the cells, so that the vessels give a red appearance to the interior of the eye. Ciliary ligament and muscle.—In the eye from which the sclerotic coat has been removed, the white band of the ciliary ligament, with the muscle close behind it {annulus albidus), may be seen in its natural position outside the front of the choroid coat.

SUPERFICIAL FLEXOR MUSCLES. 309 Fig. 45. f longus pollicis,â€”a muscle of the deep layer. As low as tlie middle of the forearm the muscle corresponds externally with the pronator teres, and below that point with the radial artery to which its tendon is taken as the guide. The ulnar border is at first in contact with the palmaris longus muscle, and then with the median nerve about two inches above the wrist. The PALMARIS LONGUS (fig. 45, ^) is often absent : or it may present great irregularity in the proportion between the fleshy and tendinous parts. Its origin is connected, like that of the preceding muscle, with the common ten- don, the fascia, and the intermuscular septa. Its long thin tendon is con- tinued along the centre of the forearm, and over the annular ligament, to end in the palmar fascia, but it gives a tendinous slip to join the short mus- cles of the thumb. The palmaris is situate between the flexor radialis and flexor carpi ulnaris muscles, and rests on the flexor sublimis digitorum. The FLEXOR CARPI ULN^ARIS (Fig. 45,'') has an aponeurotic attachment to the inner condyle of the humerus ; to the inner side of the olecranon ; and to the ridge of the ulna between the internal and posterior surfaces, for three fourths of its length. Most of the fibres are continued vertically downwards, but others obliquely for- wards to a tendon on the anterior part of the muscle in the lower half, some joining it as low as the wrist; and the tendon is inserted into the pisiform bone, while an offset is sent to the annular ligament and the muscles of the little finger. One surface of the muscle is in contact with the fascia ; * In the dissection of the body of a woman which was well developed, the muscle was found to be absent on both sides. + Superficial view of the forearm (from Quain's Arteries). 1.

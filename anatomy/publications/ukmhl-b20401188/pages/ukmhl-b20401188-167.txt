151 SPHENO-PALATINE GANGLIOK Fallopii, to join the gangliform enlargement on tlie facial nerve. "Whilst in the temporal bone, the vidian receives a twig from the tympanic nerve. The vidian nerve may be considered to consist of motor vidian a and sympathetic fibres in the same sheath, these being ^e^yg^^^"^ combined here in the same manner as in the connecting branches between the sympathetic and spinal nerves. Directions.—The student may now direct his attention to the remaining nerves and vessels in the nasal cavity. Dissection.—The nasal nerve is to be sought in the nose ^^^^^g^^^^^^ behind the nasal bone, by gently detaching the lining mem- vessels of brane, after having cut off the projecting bone. A branch is given from the nerve to the septum nasi, but probably this and the trunk of the nerve will be seen but imperfectly in the present condition of the part. The terminal branches of the internal maxillary artery in the spheno-maxillary fossa with its veins are to be completely traced out. The nasal nerve (of the ophthalmic) (fig. 18,") has been Xasal nerve already seen in the orbit and skull, and at its termination in the face (p. 47) ; and the part that connects the two through the nose is now to be learned. Entering the nasal nes beneath fossa by an aperture at the front of the ethmoid bone, the ^^^^^ ' , gives nerve gives a branch to the membrane of the septum of the nose, and is then continued in a groove behind the os nasi to the lower margin of this bone, where it escapes to the surface of the nose. Branches.—a. The branch to the septum divides into fila- branch to ments that ramify on the anterior part of that partition, and ^®P^^^ reach nearly to the lower border. h. One or two filaments are likewise furnished by the and to nerve to the mucous membrane of the fore part of the outer wall of the nasal fossa ; these extend as low as the inferior spongy bone. Terminal branches of the internal maxillary artery.—The Branches of branches of the artery in the spheno-maxillary fossa, which maxillary have not been hitherto seen, are the following:—superior artery are palatine, naso-palatine, pterygo-palatine, and vidian. 1. The superior or descending palatine is the largest palatine branch of the artery in the fossa, and accompanies the large ^^^i^"^^* palatine nerve in its canal. Arrived at the palate, the vessel is directed forwards in the roof of the mouth, and anastomoses behind the incisor teeth with the artery of the opposite side, and with a branch that descends from the nose through the incisor foramen. In its course the artery supplies branches to the other palatine canals, which pass

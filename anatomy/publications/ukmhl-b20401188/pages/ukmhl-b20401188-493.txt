SPHI^TCTER YAGm^. 473 same in both sexes, and the same description will serve, generally, for the perinseum of both the male and the female. First, the dissection of the ischio-rectal fossa is to be made ; Take first and afterwards the muscles, vessels, and nerves of the pos- foggr^^'^^^^ terior half of the perinseal space are to be examined. (See description of the male perinsenm, p. 455.) I^ext the skin is to be taken from the anterior half of the Then ex- perinseal space, as in the male ; and the transverse incision rior^aff'of' in front is to be made at the anterior part of the vulva, perinseum. The attachments of the superficial fascia are then to be looked to, and the cutaneous vessels and nerves are to be traced beneath it (p. 460). Superficial fascia.—The description of this fascia in the Superficial male will serve for the like part in the female with these modifications ; that in the female it is less perfect and of less extent, in consequence of the aperture of the vulva ; and that it is continued forwards through the labia majora (the representative of the scrotum) to the inguinal region. Dissection.—The labia and the superficial fascia are to be ^/^^^^^^^^ removed, to follow the sphincter muscle around the opening muscles, of the vagina. The two other muscles that are exposed at the same time (transversalis perinfei and erector clitoridis) resemble those in the male. The SPHINCTER VAGINA is an orbicular muscle around the Sphincter orifice of the vagina, and corresponds with the ejaculator urinse in the male. Posteriorly it is attached to the central Origin, point of the perinseum, where it mixes with the sphincter ani and transversalis muscles ; and its fibres are directed forwards on each side of the vagina, to be inserted into the insertion, body of the clitoris. The ERECTOR CLTTORiDis rosemblcs the erector of the penis ^rector , . _ clitoridis. m the male, though it is much smaller. The TRANSVERSALIS is similar to the muscle of the same ^^^^g^^^^" name in the male. The one description will suffice for it in both sexes (p. 465).- Dissection.—To see the triangular ligament of the urethra. To expose the erector and the crus clitoridis are to be detached from ngar^ent. the bone, and the outer fibres of the sphincter vaginae are to be removed. The triangular ligament transmits the urethra, but is not ^ig^^^t^ quite so strongly marked as in the male ; its extent is partly interrupted behind by the large aperture of the vagina. Dissection.—By cutting through the superficial layer of To see

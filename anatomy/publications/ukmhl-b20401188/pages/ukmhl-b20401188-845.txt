819 ENDmG OF THE AUDITOEY NERYE. On the membranous sacs the nerve divides, and its fila- Termination ments separate ; some fibrils passing through the otolith and others outside it. Those which pass outside the calcareous matter, spread out on the inner surface ; and meeting with the lining of nucleated cells, the tubules lose the white sub- they lose stance of Schwann, and end probably in a '^fibrous film," ^anc\^^^ like that of the inner stratum of the nervous layer of the retina (Todd and Bowman). The same authors state that and end in the tubules surrounded by the otolith appear to terminate in ^^^'^^ mside. free points, without losing their white substance. In the ampullary enlargement of the tubes of the semi- in the tubes circular canals the nerve enters the concave side, where it 5^^^ ' projections, forms a forked eminence (Steifensand), corresponding with the projection in the interior. The nerve is confined to the swelling, and it divides at first into two chief parts, which are directed to the sides. From these primary branches are and, branch- given fine fibrils, which communicate, and, piercing the mem- jnfide!^^ branous coat of the tube, seem to end as in the larger sacs, according to recent observations. 3 G 2

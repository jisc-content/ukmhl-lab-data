CEEMASTER MUSCLE. 489 downwards and inwards (from Poupart's ligament) over tlie except low- i//> ^^ A\ 1 i -n • est fibres. spermatic cord (fig. 74), and end m the aponeurosis near the pubes. The intervening fibres pass obliquely to the aponeurosis. The aponeurosis of the muscle covers the fore part of the abdomen from the pelvis to the chest, and blends with its muscle, fellow along the middle line. For the most part it incases Divides to the rectus ; but midway between the umbilicus and the rectus, pubes it is undivided, and lies in front of that muscle. Superiorly it is attached to the thorax after the following Attach- manner : The stratum superficial to the rectus is fixed to m®^^*^ . . ciiest, the ninth rib, and blends with the aponeurosis of the external oblique ; and the stratum beneath the muscle joins the car- tilages of the seventh and eighth ribs and the ensiform cartilage. Inferiorly its fibres become more distinct and and the separate, as in the external oblique, and are inserted into the front of the pubes, and into the pectineal line for half an inch, behind the attachment of Poupart's liga- ment. Connections of internal oblique.—The internal is covered Parts in by the external oblique muscle. It is attached on all sides, oblique.^^'^^^ except between Poupart's ligament and the pubes where it arches over the cord, and has the cremaster muscle con- tiguous to it. The parts covered by the internal oblique cannot be seen till the muscle is reflected. The CREMASTER MUSCLE (fig. 72, '^) is a fasciculus of fibres, Cremaster which lies along the lower border • of the internal oblique muscle, and is named from suspending the testicle. The muscle has attachments above, at the inner and outer sides, similar to those of the' internal oblique. Externally it is fleshy, and is attached to Poupart's ligament below, and in part beneath the internal oblique, with which some of the external fibres are connected ; and it may also join the transversalis. ^^^shy,. Internally it is small and pointed, and is fixed by tendon to j.^^^^J'^^^^^.^g. the front of the pubes and the sheath of the rectus. Between ^^^.^^ i^^^l. the two points of attachment the fibres descend on the front over the and sides of the cord, forming loops with the convexity ' downwards which reach to the tunica vaginalis testis. The muscular fibres are united by areolar tissue so as to give rise giving rise to a covering on the front of the cord, which is named fascia teric fascia. cremasterica. Occasionally the fibres may be behind as well as on the sides and front of the cord.

559 STRUCTURE OF THE SPLEEIT. may be many more. In one instance they exceeded even a score. Structure.—Enveloping the spleen are two coverings. Two coats a serous and a fibrous. The mass of the spleen is formed ^it^enal^hi by a network of fibrous or trabecular tissue, which con- the spleen, tains in its meshes the proper splenic substance, with the Malpighian corpuscles. Throughout the mass the blood- vessels and the nerves ramify. No duct exists in connection with this organ. The serous or joeritoneal coat incases the spleen, and Serous coat covers the surface except at the hilus and the posterior complete border. It is closely connected to the subjacent fibrous coat. The fibrous coat (tunica albuginea) gives strength to the Fibrous coat spleen, and forms a complete case for it. At the fissure on ^^jl^g^pro- the inner surface this investment passes into the interior cesses, with the vessels, to which it furnishes sheaths ; and if an attempt is made to detach this coat, numerous fibrous pro- cesses will be seen to be connected with the inner surface. Its colour is whitish ; and its structure is made up of areolar ^^j^®^^^^^^ and elastic tissues. In certain animals muscular fibres are said to be present in it. Dissection.—The spongy or trabecular structure will come interior of into view, by washing and squeezing a piece of fresh (bullock's) spleen under water, so as to remove the grumous looking material. The trabecular tissue forms a network through the whole and dispo- interior of the spleen, similar to that of a sponge, which is fibrous joined on the one hand to the external casing and on the tissue in it. other to sheaths around the vessels. Its processes or threads To form an are white, flattened or cylindrical, and average from y^o^th s[i^uc^^^i,e to -g-^Qth of an inch : they consist of fibrous and elastic tissues. In animals muscular fibres are described as existing in the processes (Kolliker). The interstices between the fibres communicate freely together, and contain the proper substance of the spleen, and the vessels. Microscopic appearances. —The characters of the substance of the spleen and of the Malpighian bodies must be made out with the aid of the microscope. The splenic pulp is a soft semi-fluid red-brown mass, which ^ ^^^^^^^^. fills the areolae of the white trabecular structure. Under colour, and the microscope this material is composed of very fine fibres ^^0^^°^^" and bloodvessels, with special cells, and small masses of blood undergoing transformation into pigment granule cells (Kolliker).

695 ANTERIOR CRURAL NERVE. tinned along the outer side of that vessel, beneath the apo- neurosis covering the same, as far as the opening in the adductor magnus muscle. At that spot the nerve passes from beneath the aponeurosis, and is continued under the becomes cu^ sartorius muscle to the upper part of the leg, to become tile knee; cutaneous as before said. It supplies two offsets whilst it is contained in the thigh beneath the fascia. a. The communicating branch arises about the middle of hasacom- the thigh, and crosses inwards beneath the sartorius to join ^^"^^^^^^^^S" the internal cutaneous and the obturator in the plexus : this branch is sometimes absent. h. The patellar branch springs from the nerve near the and a pa- knee joint, and perforating the sartorius muscle and the fascia lata, ends in the integument over the knee (p. 675). B. The deep or muscular part of the anterior crural nerve From the gives branches to all the muscles of the front of the thigh, ^^^^^P P^^^^ except the tensor vaginse femoris ; and it supplies also an offset to one of the adductor muscles, viz., the pectineus. Two slender nerves cross beneath the femoral artery, and branches to J. XI j_ • i? J? J.1 ±' pectiueus: enter the anterior surface of the pectineus. Branches to the sartorius are furnished by the middle or sartorius; by the internal cutaneous nerve, whilst it is in contact with that muscle. A nerve enters the under surface of the rectus muscle at rectus; the upper part, and divides into branches as it is about to penetrate the fibres. The fierve to the vastus externus separates into two or more vastus ex- branches as it enters the muscle. From one of these an knee ioint • articular filament is continued downwards to the knee joint, which it enters on the anterior aspect. The 7ierve to the vastus internus is nearly as large in size f^i-g^^^^^^g^^^ as the internal saphenous, in common with which it often arises. To the upper part of the muscle it furnishes one or more branches, and is then continued as far as the centre of the thigh, where it ends in offsets to the muscle and the knee joint. a. The articular branch is prolonged to the inner side of Articular the knee joint on or in the vastus, and on the tendon of the to knee, adductor magnus ; and it is distributed over the synovial membrane of the front of the articulation. This small nerve accompanies the deep branch of the anastomotic artery. A branch of nerve to the tensor vagince femoris is derived Nerve of from the superior gluteal (p. 709), and enters the under sur- l^crluli. face of the muscle. In the fibres it extends nearly to the lower end.

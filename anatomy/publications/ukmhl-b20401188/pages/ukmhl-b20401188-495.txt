CHAPTER VIII. DISSECTIOlSr OF THE ABDOMEK Section I. WALL OF TPIE ABDOMEN. The dissector may be reminded that the peringeum is Directions allotted to him with the abdomen. And he is to keep in dissection mind that he has not only to examine that region, but to proceed as far in the description of the abdomen as the end of Section III. before the body is turned for the dissection of the back. Fosition.—The body will be sufficiently raised by the Position of blocks placed beneath the thorax and head according to the directions given in the dissection of the uj)per limbs and neck, but the dissector should see that the chest is higher than the pelvis. After the abdomen has been inflated by an aperture through the umbilicus, let the markings on the surface be first attended to. Surface-marhing.—On its anterior aspect the abdomen is Appear- for the most part convex, especially in fat bodies ; whilst fj^^^^Q^^^he^ on the sides, between the ribs and the crista ilii, the surface abdomen, is somewhat depressed. Along the middle line is a slight groove over the linea alba, which presents about its centre the excavation of the umbilicus. Inferiorly the groove ceases a little above -the pelvis in the prominence of the pubes ; and superiorly it subsides below the ensiform carti- lage in a hollow named the epigastric fossa. On each side of the middle line is the projection of the rectus muscle, and this is intersected in young and well-formed bodies by two or three transverse depressions. Underneath the eminence of the pubes the student will Projection be able to recognise with his finger the symphysis pubis, and P^bes to trace outwards from it the contiguous pubic crest of bone which leads to the pubic spinous process. If the finger is part's liga- carried still outwards to the crest of the innominate bone,

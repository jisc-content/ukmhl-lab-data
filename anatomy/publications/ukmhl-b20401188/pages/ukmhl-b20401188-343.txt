MUSCLES OF THE LITTLE FINGER. 325 opponens from about the outer two thirds of the annular ligament, at the lowest part, and from the os magnum. The inner head has a wide origin from the os trapezoides inner head, and OS magnum, from the sheath of the flexor carpi radialis, and from the bases of the second and third metacarpal bones. The heads are soon blended in one mass ; and this is g^j^^e^^^y inserted by two parts into the sides of the base of the first two parts, phalanx of the thumb,—the inner piece being united with the adductor, and the outer with the abductor poUicis. A sesamoid bone is connected with each lateral piece at its in- sertion. The tendon of the long flexor lies on this muscle, it is deep in and afterwards occupies the interval between the processes i^^nd. of insertion ; and the deep palmar arch of the radial artery- comes from beneath the inner head. The ADDUCTOR POLLicis is pointed at the thumb, and wide Adductor at the opposite end. Its origin is fixed to the anterior or from third lower two thirds of the metacarpal bone of the middle finger, ^^^^^^^^^ on the palmar aspect ; and its insertion is attached, with that of the short flexor, to the inner side of the first phalanx j^-^^g gj^^^,^ of the thumb. The cutaneous surface is in contact with the flexor, tendons of the flexor profundus and their lumbrical muscles ; and the deep surface lies over (in this position) the abductor indicis in the first interosseous space, and the second and third metacarpal bones and the intervening muscles. Short Muscles of the Little Finger.—There are com- Two or three monly two muscles in the ball of the little finger,—an ab- ifttTe finger ductor and an adductor. Sometimes there is a short flexor muscle between the other two. The ABDUCTOR MINIMI DIGITI is the most internal of the Abductor short muscles. It arises from the pisiform bone and the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris, and is inserted into the jg ^i^q most ulnar side of the base of the first phalanx of the little finger ; internal. an ofi'set is sent from it to the extensor tendon on the back of the phalanx. The palmaris brevis partly conceals the muscle. The FLEXOR BREVIS MINIMI DIGITI appears to be a part Flexor of the abductor. Placed at the radial border of the pre- often absent ceding muscle, it takes origin from the fcip of the process of the unciform bone, and slightly from the annular ligament; Is on the it h inserted with the abductor into the first phalanx. It ^g^eding.^' lies on the adductor: and near its origin it is separated from the abductor muscle by the deep branches of the ulnar artery and nerve. The ADDUCTOR vel opponens minimi DIGITI resembles the Opponens opponens pollicis in being attached to the body of the meta-

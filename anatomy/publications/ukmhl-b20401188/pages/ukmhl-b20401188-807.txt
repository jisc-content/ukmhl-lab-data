STRUCTURE OF THE CORNEA. 781 with the position of the primitive formative cells. Though interlaced with one another (fig. 117, c), the fibres have rather a longitudinal direction towards the back of the ball, and a transverse one at the outer surface near the cornea. Only a few vessels ramify in the membrane. The existence Vessels and of nerves in it is doubtful. uewes. Cornea.—This firm transparent membrane (cornea pellu- cornea: cida) fits into the front of the eyeball, of which it forms about one sixth. Its shape is circular, though, when viewed extent and in front, particularly in the ox, it appears largest in the °^^^* transverse direction in consequence of the opaque sclerotic structure reaching further on it above and below than on the sides. It is smooth and soft to the touch, is convex ante- Curve, riorly, but concave posteriorly, and is of equal thickness throughout. Its anterior is of rather less extent than its surface, posterior surface. At the circumference it is blended v/ith the sclerotic coat by continuity of tissue ; and it measures size, about half an inch transversely, but rather less from above down. This clear and diaphanous structure, resembling in appear- Situation m ance the glass of a watch, bounds the anterior chamber of scierotiV^^ the eyeball, and gives passage to the rays of light entering the organ. When the cornea is supported by the aqueous its action on humour, it deflects the rays of light transmitted to the eye, {^g^^'"^-'^ and thus influences by its greater or smaller convexity the different degrees of sight at a distance. After death it be- comes flaccid from the transudation of the aqueous humour; or if it is immersed in water it is rendered opaque by infil- tration of the tissue by that fluid. Structure (fig. 118, a).—The cornea is laminar in texture. Composedo± It is constructed of a special, thick part called cornea proper: ^^y®^'^- in front of this is a thin elastic layer with an epithelial stratum ; and behind it is another fine elastic membrane covered by an epithelium. The two structures in front of the proper cornea constitute the conjunctiva : and the two behind form the membrane of Demours.

The cornea proper (lamellated cornea) is made up of a Cornea series of superposed layers, about sixty in number in a fo^^^g^^^^f ♦ section at a given spot, which join one another at numerous layers, points, and cannot therefore be detached for any distance.^" * The facts stated in the description in this and in many other places,

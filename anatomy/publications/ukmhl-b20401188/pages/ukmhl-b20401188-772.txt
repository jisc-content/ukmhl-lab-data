746 DISSECTIOIT OF THE FOOT. layer of of the foot are contained the interossei muscles, and the ten- dons of the tibialis posticus and peroneus longus muscles. Interossei, The INTEROSSEI MUSCLES are situate in the intervals be- '"^^^ tween the metatarsal bones. They consist of two sets, plantar and dorsal, like the interossei in the hand. Seven plantar and in number, there are three plantar and four dorsal; and two dorsal. found in each space, except in the innermost. Fig. 106.* Fig. lOT.f The plantar interossei belong to the three outer metatarsal bones. They arise from the under and inner surfaces of the bones, and are inserted into the tibial side of the base of the metatarsal phalanx of the same toes ; and an expansion is continued from each to the extensor tendon on the dorsum of the phalanx. These muscles are smaller than the dorsal, and are placed more in the sole of the foot. By their action they would approximate the three outer toes to the middle one. The dorsal interossei, one in each space, arise from the Tliree plan- tar for three outer toes. Action.

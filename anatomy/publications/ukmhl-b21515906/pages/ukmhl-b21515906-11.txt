The scarcity of ' bodies ' in the winter, and exclusion from the dissecting-room during the summer session, oblige the student in part to study Anatomy from books, and here his chief difficulty is the want of good practical illustrations. If he relies upon the text alone, he finds it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to retain the matter that he reads until he has the opportunity of verifying it in the dissecting-room.

PREFACE. vi determine to which part they individually belong, and having done this he must wade through a complicated reference foot-note for information as to the name of the structure. In order to supply the wants of the student, ' The Descriptive Atlas of Anatomy ' has been prepared, with a view to correctness, clear- ness, simplicity, and completeness. The parts have been copiously named and described in situ, and the arteries and veins have been COLOURED. Every figure has been carefully revised by a Metropolitan Hospital Surgeon and a successful teacher of Anatomy in one of the chief London Medical Schools. Since Latin ceased to be the only language used in Medicine, there has existed a curious combination of Latin and English in the descrip- tion of Anatomical Structures. In the commencement of the preparation of this work, it had been intended to use Latin terms only, but it has been found undesirable to adhere to this system, so that although many more Latin names and terms are employed here than in other English works upon Anatomy, much of the usual hybrid mode of description has been adopted. The abbreviations are very simple, and most of them are already well known to students. A. V. and N. represent Artery, Vein, and Nerve. The borders or surfaces of bones which articulate with others are indicated by dotted lines with the names of the articulating bone in juxta-position: thus at the anterior border of the Parietal bone appears 'Artie. Os. Front,' meaning that as far as the dotted line indicates this bone articulates with the Frontal bone.

In the winter of 1746 he was en- gaged by a society of navy surgeons to give a few lectures on the operations of surgery, and the structure of the parts more imme- diately concerned in them. Upon this trial he met with such general approbation, that he was encouraged to take up anatomy the ensuing winter on an extended scale. What has been his success, and what his reputation, you need not be told. No one ever pos- sessed more enthusiasm for the art, more persevering industry, more acuteness of in- vestigation, more perspicuity of expression, or indeed a greater share of natural elo- quence. He was uncommonly ready in his apprehensions, and singularly happy in mak- ing others understand what he knew himself. His arrangement of any subject was clear and judicious ; he knew how far the attention would reach, and when it was beginning to decline; and he had a most happy talent of introducing anecdotes which might excite, amuse, and instruct.

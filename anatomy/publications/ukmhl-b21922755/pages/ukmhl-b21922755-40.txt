30 the chief active power of its propulsion; the arteries being the tubes conveying the blood from the heart to every part of the body, and the veins being the tubes conducting the blood back to the heart to renew its circula- tion. The whole forms one great system complete in itself, the separate parts being dependent on each other. In order, how- ever, to understand the progress of this dis- covery, it will be necessary to describe a little more particularly the apparatus, and the course of circulation in the human body. The human heart consists of four cavities, two of which have been named auricles, and two ventricles. The right auricle communi- cates, by a large opening, with the right ven- tricle ; and the left auricle communicates, by a similar opening, with the left ventricle; but the auricle and ventricle on the one side are generally entirely separate from those on the other. The veins open into the auricles, by which blood is poured into the heart; and the arteries pass out of the ventricles, con- veying the blood to the lungs, where it un- dergoes some change, and distributing it over the whole body. This forms what has been

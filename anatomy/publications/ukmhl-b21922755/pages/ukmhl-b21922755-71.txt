61 siderably improved microscopical instruments by being extremely careful in polishing the glass, and giving them an increased magni- fying power. He was thence enabled to ex- amine parts with the utmost minuteness; and the calculations he has formed often astonish, and almost stagger the belief. This kind of observation became at length very generally diffused among anatomists, so that they were rather too much attached to it, for the mind is naturally pleased with wonder. In their enthusiasm, however, they made many real and useful discoveries. The com- ponent parts of the blood, of milk, of oil, and of other fluids, were detected; the circulation of the blood was brought under the exami- nation of the eye, in the transparent mem- branes of animals; and the structure of many of the solid parts of the body was much better ascertained. The same kind of investigation has been continued among succeeding ana- tomists, so that every part of the body has been minutely examined ; but they have used more caution, as they have been more aware of the fallacies and errors which attend very minute microscopical observations.

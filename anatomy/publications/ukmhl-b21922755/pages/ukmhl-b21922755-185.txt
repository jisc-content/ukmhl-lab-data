175 importance. It is usual to endeavour through- out the course of it to prevent suppuration from taking place, by the repeated application of leeches under the angles of the lower jaw. It is certainly very desirable that suppu- ration should be prevented, and that in- flammation of the tonsils should gradually subside by resolution. I have found, how- ever, by experience, that suppuration is by such means very often not prevented, but only that inflammation proceeds more slowly to this issue. Hence the patient suffers for a considerably longer time; and the suffering in this disease is often very great. If, there- fore, one or two applications of leeches do not lessen materially the inflammation of the tonsils and velum pendulum palati, I should recommend the progress of the inflammation to be encouraged by the inhaling of warm vapour into the mouth, and the application of poultices to the external fauces. In this way the disease will go through its progress more quickly, and the patient will suffer much less.

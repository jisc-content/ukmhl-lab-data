118 consisted principally of the cortical, the ves- sels to be seen on the pia mater would have been both larger and more numerous. Small processes of membrane pass into the sub- stance of the medulla spinalis from the pia mater; but these do not put on any regular form, as in the cerebrum or cerebellum. Upon each side, the external surface of the pia mater is joined to the inner lamina of the dura mater, at regular distances, by short processes from a small firm tendinous sub- stance. This has been named the ligamen- turn denticulatum, and is peculiar to the co- verings of the spinal marrow, there being no such junction between the dura mater and pia mater of any part of the brain. The arteries of the spinal marrow are small, and are derived chiefly from the upper ex- tremities of the two vertebral. From the mode of their origin, the blood must circu- late in them with very little impetus, which corresponds with the general plan of the ar- terial system in the brain. In some places small branches pass in by the lateral foramina of the spine, from the intercostal and lumbar arteries. The veins of the pia mater open

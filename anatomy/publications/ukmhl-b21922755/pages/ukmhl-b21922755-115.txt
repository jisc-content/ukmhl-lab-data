105 from it with some difficulty, and is so very fine and transparent as to escape observation. In some places, as under the junction of the optic nerves, or between the lobes of the ce- rebellum behind, it may be seen separate, and then it appears to be a membrane with- out any vessels large enough to admit the globules of the blood. When a fluid resem- bling thin jelly is thrown out under this mem- brane, as frequently happens during fevers, it may be seen in many parts separated from the pia mater, and is then somewhat thick- ened. It also attends the medulla spinalis through the canal of the spine; but of its use no satisfactory opinion has hitherto been formed. The pia mater lies in immediate contact with the substance of the brain. It is a very fine transparent membrane, upon which are spread a great number of arteries and veins. These contain partly a florid and partly a dark-coloured blood, so as to produce a va- ried appearance ; and there are few objects more beautiful than the pia mater crowded with blood-vessels. In most parts there is no adhesion between the pia mater and the

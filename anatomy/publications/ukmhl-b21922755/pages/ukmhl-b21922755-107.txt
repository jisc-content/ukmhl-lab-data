97 system bears a very different proportion to the general mass of the body. In quadrupeds the brain is larger in proportion to the size of the body than in any other class, man only excepted. In amphibious animals, fishes, and insects, it is proportionably much smaller; and some tribes of animals are so simple in their organization, as apparently to be with- out nerves and a brain altogether. Of this kind is the hydatid in sheep, which is an ex- ample of the most simple kind of animal. In these we may either suppose that the ner- vous fibrils diffused through the body are so small, as not to be capable of detection; or we may suppose that nervous matter is so blended with the general structure of the body, as not really to form a distinct orga- nization. In animals of so simple a structure, which of these two conjectures is true it is perhaps impossible to ascertain, but Mr. Hun- ter was inclined to believe the latter. In man the relative proportion of the size of the brain to the whole body is greater than in any other animal; and in comparing the human brain with that of the common quadrupeds of a much larger size than man, H

129 the origin of the nerves along which the im- pression had been conveyed, or whether it is a change diffused over the whole mass of the brain. We may be said, if possible, to know less of the various changes produced by va- rious modes of impression, from whence the great variety of sensations, of which the body is capable, is derived. Notwithstanding the state of our ignorance upon this subject, we know by experience that several circum- stances may take place in the brain, by which it may either be unfitted to receive impres- sions at all, or will receive them very imper- fectly. These circumstances are commonly various causes of pressure applied to the brain, of which the principal are the accu- mulation of water, and the extravasation of blood. The first produces its effect more slowly, and most frequently happens at an early age. The other produces its effect suddenly, and hardly ever happens but at the middle, or more advanced periods of life. Tu- mours of different kinds growing in the brain itself, or in its neighbourhood, occasionally produce the same effect; but these happen rarely in comparison with the two former K

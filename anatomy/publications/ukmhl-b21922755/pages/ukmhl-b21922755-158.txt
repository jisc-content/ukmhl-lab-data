Internal impressions in some parts of the body are a cause of muscular action. Thus the application of the blood to the internal surface of the cavities of the heart, appears to be the cause which excites it to contract. Although the small nervous fibrils of the heart have perhaps never been distinctly traced to its cavities, yet there can be little doubt of their reaching them; and the im- pression made upon their extremities is com- municated to the other branches, so that those exert their influence also in exciting muscular action.

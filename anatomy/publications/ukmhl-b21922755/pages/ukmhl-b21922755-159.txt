149 muscles of the body, but through the inter- vention of blood-vessels. This is to bestow upon blood-vessels an office which one would not be willing to admit but upon the most unequivocal evidence. In the intestinal canal, the peristaltic mo- tion is excited by the impression of the con- tents of the intestines upon the very fine nerves which reach the villi of the inner membrane. These are branches of the same nerves which supply the muscular coat of the intestines, and the impression is communi- cated from the former to the latter. The peristaltic motion is therefore produced with- out any impression being immediately ap- plied to the proper nerves of that motion, but by a principle which has been established in the animal oeconomy,â€”that impressions ap- plied to the nerves of the villous are capable of exciting the nerves of the muscular coat. Over these actions volition has no power, and we are not conscious of their taking place: they go on entirely without our knowledge. Nerves may be excited by external stimuli so as to produce the action of muscles. If a

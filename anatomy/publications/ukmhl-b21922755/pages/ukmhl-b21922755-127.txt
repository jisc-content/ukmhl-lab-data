117 appearance as within the cavity of the cra- nium, but does not adhere firmly to the bones of the spine. Upon each side, in the dura mater, there is a chain of small irregular ca- vities between its outer and inner laminae, into which the veins of the spinal marrow pour their blood. These are of the same kind, and formed with the same view, as the sinuses of the dura mater within the cranium. The dura mater attending the spinal marrow is perforated on each side by foramina, for the passage of lateral nerves. The tunica arachnoides is continued along the spinal marrow from that membrane within the cranium. Within the canal of the spine it is but loosely applied to the pia mater, so that it can easily be separated by inflation; and it then appears to be a very distinct membrane. The spinal marrow is, last of all, covered by the pia mater; but this appears to be a less vascular membrane than where it covers the brain. This no doubt arises from the less quantity of blood, in proportion, which is wanted for the medulla spinalis, which con- sists chiefly of medullary substance. Had it

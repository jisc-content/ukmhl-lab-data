It is in this point of view that anatomy and physiology become so very im- portant, as affording the most likely means of relieving the body when suffering under disease. When the structure and natural action of any part is understood, it will best assist us in discovering what causes may influ- ence the action which produces a morbid change, and how the application of other influences may probably counteract these causes, so as to protect the body from them. It will still go further ; for when the causes have been applied so as to produce their ef- fects, it will be most likely to point out what may be serviceable in bringing back the parts to a natural mode of action. The symptoms of a disease are appearances which take place while the body is under a diseased action, and depend on something more secluded from observation.

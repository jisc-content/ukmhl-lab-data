104 to be capable of contraction like a muscle, and to act upon the brain for the expulsion of a nervous fluid ; but it is now well known to be perfectly inactive. It consists of a structure, having the same essential properties as ligament and tendon, and is totally in- capable of any contraction ; it is also insen- . sible when in its healthy state. Indeed it is wonderful how this opinion could ever have been formed, when it is considered that the dura mater adheres closely to every part of the cranium, and therefore could not exert any power of contraction were it possessed of such a power, and when it is considered that the brain could not sustain the pressure which must necessarily arise from this con- traction.. The dura mater accompanies the spinal marrow through the whole of its course; but this will be afterwards more particularly noticed. The next membrane which surrounds the brain is called the tunica arachnoides. This is a very fine transparent membrane, inter- posed between the dura mater and the pia mater. It is in most places applied very closely to the pia mater, so as to be separated

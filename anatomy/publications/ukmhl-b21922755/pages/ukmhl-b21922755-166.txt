Others have supposed that the mobility of the nervous influence was much diminished, and that during sleep this property was gra- dually recovered to its full extent. It is ob- vious, however, that all opinions upon this subject must rest merely upon conjecture. We do not know the state of the nervous i system during the full activity of its func- tions, and therefore we must be little able to discover what is its state when many of these functions are suspended.

137 may be made by a certain education in dis- criminating the sensations derived from every organ of sense. This education merely con- sists in a very close attention to sensations when produced, and in their being frequently subjected to this attention. Thus we can ar- rive at a great degree of accuracy in discri- minating between different sensations of taste, or of smell, or of hearing, which are separated from each other by such nice shades of dis- tinction, that they would be confounded by persons who had not paid attention to this particular species of education. Habit has considerable influence in regu- lating our sensations, as well as many other functions of the body. In general it dimi- nishes the force of sensations according to the degree of habit, or the frequency of their being excited. It connects sensations with objects with which they are not naturally associated. It can even change the nature of sensations, rendering those which were ori- ginally agreeable indifferent, or perhaps even disagreeable; and, on the contrary, rendering those at length pleasant which were originally disagreeable to us.

INTRODUCTORY LECTURE. PART II. We have now traced the progress of ana- tomy to the discovery of one of the most im- portant functions in an animal body,â€”the mode of conveying the materials for its pre- servation and support. These materials are, however, always exhausting, so as to require a system of supply. This is accomplished by a certain order of vessels called lacteals, which arise from the inner surface of the in- testines, and which, after having passed through a number of glands, terminate in a considerable duct, opening into a large vein near the heart. These vessels absorb the chyle from the intestinal canal, and convey it into the general mass of circulating blood,

ducing Epilepsy are various; but I believe that in this disease there is commonly a ten- dency to a greater accumulation of blood than is natural in the vessels of the brain. THE TIC DOULOUREUX. The Tic Douloureux seems to me likewise to have become more common of late years, and I think it is more frequent among men than women. I do not recollect to have seen any instance in which it has been perma- nently cured, either by internal medicines or by an operation. I have known some instances of its being cured for a time (that is, for several months or even a year) by me- dicines ; and those which have appeared to me of most use are Peruvian bark and ar- senic. The operation of dividing the nerve has in some instances prevented a return of the disease for one or two years, but has not, as far as I know, prevented it permanently. The courage and patience under suffering in this complaint, displayed by some individuals, have been truly astonishing.

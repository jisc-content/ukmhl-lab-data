Under such circum- stances it was likely that many anatomists should arise of distinguished reputation ; but many we shall be obliged to omit, as it is our present object to give only the history of great improvements. The proper method of studying anatomy was now introduced and practised, so that every day was adding some discovery : but in a short history it can only be allowed to trace the most considerable, a longer account being left to the gratification of a more prepared and opportune curiosity. The greater discoveries and improvements in anatomy must comprehend either the ex- planation of a general system, or the inven- tion of the means to investigate more accu- rately the structure of an animal body. The one really adds to physiology, and the other produces a more intimate acquaintance with the minuter structure of parts, which furnishes the materials for physiology. The greater discoveries in anatomy may be confined to the doctrines of the circula- tion and absorption; and the application of microscopes, together with the invention of injections, may be considered as the chief

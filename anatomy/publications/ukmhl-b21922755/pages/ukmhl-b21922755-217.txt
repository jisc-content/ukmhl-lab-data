OF SOME DISEASES OF THE PANCREAS. The pancreas is upon the whole less liable to disease than any other important gland in the body. I do not recollect that in private practice I have met with one case in which there was satisfactory evidence of the pan- creas being diseased ; and I have only known of a solitary example of it during the thirteen years in which I was a physician of St. George’s Hospital. This case was under the care of another physician*, and the pancreas was not known to be diseased till the patient’s body was examined after death. The pain in the epigastric region, sickness, uneasiness or pain in the loins, which belong to inflam- mation and enlargement of the pancreas, be- long also to other diseases, and therefore do not particularly indicate a disease in this im- portant viscus. Were the enlargement so great that it could be ascertained by an at- # Dr. Heberden, junior.

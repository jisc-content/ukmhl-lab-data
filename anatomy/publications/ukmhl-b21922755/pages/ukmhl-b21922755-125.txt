115 within the cranium, at its basis. He has not, however, traced them, by injection, into ab- sorbent glands ; and other anatomists have not been able hitherto to detect the same ap- pearances. There is every reason, however, to suppose that the brain has absorbent ves- sels as well as arteries and veins; but they cannot be very obvious, or they must have been long ago ascertained. The nature of the substance of the brain must add very much to the difficulty of their detection; but time, perseverance, and favourable opportu- nities will at length overcome every difficulty, and the absorbent vessels of the brain will be as certainly known to anatomists as those of other parts. Many circumstances show that absorption takes place in the brain, and it cannot be believed that it is carried on by a different apparatus, or on different principles, than in other parts of the body. The medulla oblongata and medulla spinalis may be considered as an elongation of the brain, being formed by the junction be- tween the cerebrum and cerebellum. The medulla spinalis is merely the continuation of the medulla oblongata passing into a canal of i 2

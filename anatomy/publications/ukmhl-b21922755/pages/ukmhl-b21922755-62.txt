52 of Veslingius, which came into his hands, and were afterwards published by him. Bar- tholin speaks as if he were sore about the dis- covery, a circumstance always of suspicion. 44 We envy ‚Äù says he, 44 no one's reputation ; let the palm of fame lie open to all; only let i the honour of the invention be left to us, as we trust we deserve it." The same discovery has also been attri- buted to an English physician, named Jo- liffe. This rests upon the authority of Glis- son, who has stated that in June 1653, when Dr. Joliffe was taking his degree at Cambridge, he mentioned to him that he had observed in various parts of different animals, as in the limbs, testicles, womb, &c., vessels filled with a watery fluid, which was directed in its course towards the root of the mesen- tery. It is very possible that Joliffe* may have remarked these vessels without any hint from others, because it is very possible for different persons engaged in the same pur- suits to make the same discovery : yet as Rudbeck has fixed on a particular date, # Joliffe himself has not written any thing upon this subject.

It is for this reason that lectures by them- selves never did make, nor ever can make a good anatomist. Too many objects pass be- fore the eye in a short time to produce a proper impression. The practice of anatomy or dissection must be added, without which a man can only attain a wavering knowledge. But it ought to be our aim to have our know- ledge certain and ready, resembling as much as possible original impressions, upon which we may be able immediately to judge and act. Without this, relief will sometimes be withheld till the opportunity of affording it is past; and it is always a pitiful business to hunt for knowledge as circumstances offer. There should be at all times a considerable fund ready to satisfy demands. Anatomy cannot be learnt without the em- ployment of the knife upon the dead body, that great basis on which we are to build the

58 extended and facilitated, are so important with respect to the functions of the animal economy, that an inquiry into their invention is very closely connected with even a general view of the progress of this branch of know- ledge. It does not confine itself within nar- row limits, but reaches to the very foundation of anatomy and physiology. The utmost perfection of examination into animal structure appears to be, that the parts should be rendered exceedingly distinct to the senses. This can only be managed in two ways; viz. by making the senses more acute, and the parts themselves more distinct. On these two circumstances must rest all the improvements which can be made in exami- ning the structure of an animal body. We are therefore to look for improvements in the examination of animal structure to the in- vention of magnifying-glasses, and to the arts of preparation, particularly of injection. The first step in the progress of anatomy is to observe large and obvious parts. These would for some time sufficiently occupy the mind, and it would not occur that any thing further could be done.

51 the liver, and concluded immediately that they were not lacteals, but a new set of ves- sels hitherto unknown; and he called them, from the sort of fluid which they carried, vasa serosa. In the year 1652, in the months of February and March, he discovered the same sort of vessels passing to the glands of the groin, and traced them on to the thoracic duct. These circumstances were sufficient to se- cure the discovery to Rudbeck, if he were not anticipated by any other anatomist. Thomas Bartholin, a Dane*, has laid claim to the discovery ; but by his own account he was not acquainted with the lymphatic ves- sels till the month of December 1651, and had not traced them on to the thoracic duct like Rudbeck. Indeed there is great reason to suspect that Bartholin has been uncandid upon this subject. It is more than likely that he had heard something of Rudbeck's discovery, from some inadvertent expressions in his own work; and it is probable that a hint had been given him from the manuscripts * Born at Copenhagen in l6l6.

The nerve itself, how- ever, remains perfectly still; nor does it ap- pear to undergo any change whatever. In the same manner, whether the influence of volition, or of excitements of the mind, or influence of any other kind be conveyed along nerves to muscles, the nerves them- selves seem to undergo no change, however great may be the effect produced on the mus- cles in which they terminate. Mechanical or chemical stimuli, applied immediately to muscles themselves, will ex- cite them to contraction. This probably depends upon the very minute fibrils of the nerves being impressed, which are distri- buted through muscles in great numbers, al- though they are too small for observation ; and therefore in this case the impression is pro- bably still conveyed from nerves to muscles. In animals of so simple an organization that nerves have not yet been discovered in

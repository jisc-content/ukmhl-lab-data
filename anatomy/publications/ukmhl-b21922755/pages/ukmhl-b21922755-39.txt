29 means to develope the minuter structure of an animal body. Before entering upon the history of the circulation, it will be necessary, in order to render it intelligible, to explain what the dis- covery is : but this shall be done very briefly. By the circulation is meant the distribution of the blood through the body, and its return again to a certain point, in order to undergo a succeeding distribution. This is a very important function in the animal economy, for by it every part of the body is nourished and preserved; is increased in growth, or is sup- plied when deficient.

119 into the chain of small sinuses in the dura mater, and from thence the blood is conveyed by short communicating branches to the in- tercostal and lumbar veins. The absorbent i '0 vessels of the spinal marrow have not as yet been discovered, but still there can be no reasonable doubt of their existence. There are a number of cords passing from the brain, or its appendages, to different parts of the body, which have been named nerves. Those within the cranium arise partly from particular structures in the brain itself, as the corpora striata, thalami nervorum opti- corum, and partly from a substance formed by the junction of the cerebrum and cerebel- lum. A great number arise from each side of the medulla spinalis. None can be said to arise out of the common mass of the brain. Nerves at their origin are either formed of one cord, as the optic nerve, or are composed of a single plane of fibrils, which afterwards unite together, as the eighth and ninth pairs of nerves ; or they are made up by the union of a double plane of fibrils, as the nerves de- rived from the spinal marrow. Some of the nerves are composed of pure

Under such circumstances he had much opportunity of observation, which he was not disposed to neglect; for he has raised to himself a name admired by some succeeding anatomists even to a degree of servility.

One of the sinuses of the brain he has called torcular, and it is known at present by the name of the Torcular of Herophilus.

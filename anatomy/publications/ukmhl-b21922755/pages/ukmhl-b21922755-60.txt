50 discoverer of the lymphatic vessels. They had first, indeed, according to Haller's ac- count, been seen by Veslingius, going from the spleen along the pancreas; but he had not established by experiments their parti- cular nature. This discovery is therefore to be considered as Rudbeck's, who so examined them, as clearly to distinguish that they were a peculiar set of vessels, which had hitherto escaped the observation of anatomists. The account he has given of his discovery is very clear and natural. He says that in the months of October and November of the year 1650, and in the months of January, February, March, April, September, October, and No- vember of the year 1651, he made many dis- sections in order to ascertain whether the lacteals accompany the vena port arum, and terminate in the porta of the liver, as was the common opinion among anatomists.

33 by the power of heat, is of a yellow colour, and has the quality of fire; so that it may be considered as an exhaling vapour from the purer blood, containing water, air, and fire. It is produced by a mixture taking place in the lungs, of the inspired air with the elabo- rated subtile blood, which the right ventricle of the heart communicates to the left. This communication, however, does not happen through the septum of the heart, as is the common opinion; but by a wonderful con- trivance the subtile blood is agitated in a long passage through the lungs, from the right ventricle of the heart, and is poured from the arterious vein into the veinous artery. In the veinous artery it is mixed with the inspired air, and becomes purified by expiration. Thus at length the mixture is attracted from the left ventricle of the heart by diastole, being a fit material for the for- mation of vital spirit. That there is such a communication through the lungs is proved by the various union and anastomosis of the arterious vein and veinous artery in the lungs. There is an additional proof from the bulk of the arterious vein, which would neither be of D

66 If a vessel be distended with air, and is after- wards to be dissected, when the least punc- ture is made through its coats, all the air escapes, the vessel collapses, and returns to its former obscurity. It affords, however, a ready means,of showing the course, number, and size of vessels, which in that state may not be intended to be traced more accurately by dissection. When fluids, such as milk, ink, and solu- tions of metals are employed for injection, although they render the vessels much more distinct to the eye, yet they will not allow any accurate tracing by dissection; for punc- tures must occasionally be made, and the fluid will escape. It is probable too, that even when no puncture has been made, the fluid would gradually evaporate, or transude through the vessels, so as to leave them empty. For these reasons it became necessary that other materials of injection should be dis- covered, such as would not escape by punc- tures, nor leave the vessels dry by evapora- tion. When this difficulty was overcome, a contrivance was still wanting to apply a force capable of propelling the materials of injec-

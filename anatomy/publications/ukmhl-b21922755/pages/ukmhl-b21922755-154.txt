Of this kind are such muscles as are employed in carry- ing on a vital function, but which are also employed for purposes that only occasionally take place, and are to be regulated by vo- lition. Thus the muscles of respiration may be said, with regard to their common func- tion, to be involuntary muscles. They are as invariable in carrying on respiration as the heart is in carrying on the circulation, and are as little dependent upon the atten- tion of the mind. They are not, however, purely involuntary muscles; for respiration can be varied by volition, both in the quan- tity of air taken into, and thrown out from the lungs, and in the frequency of inspiration and expiration in a given time. It was con- venient, and often necessary, that this ope- ration should in some measure be under the regulation of our will. The muscles subser- vient to respiration are also capable of pro- ducing certain effects upon some of the ab- dominal viscera, assisting them to expel what they may contain; and this was to be in some degree regulated by our volition.

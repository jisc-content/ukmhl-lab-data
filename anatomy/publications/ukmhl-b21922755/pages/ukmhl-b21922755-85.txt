75 He had first been intended for surgery, but he very much disliked all operations which might give pain. He was therefore easily induced to quit it, and to follow mid- wifery, for which he was singularly calculated by the delicacy of his manners, and a very quick perception of the caprices of the world. Not long after this change in the line of his profession, when his reputation was rising high, the University of Glasgow was proud to recollect him among her offspring, and to show a testimony of their respect by con- ferring on him the degree of Doctor in Physic. At a very early period, having foreseen that he would soon be so much distracted by the multiplicity of business, as to prevent him from carrying on anatomy on the extended scale he wished to do, he sent for his brother, John Hunter, to assist him in these pursuits. What judgement he has shown in this choice the distinguished reputation of the latter has long ago determined. He was afterwards assisted also by Mr. Hewson and Mr. Cruik- shank, whose merits as anatomists have been deservedly honoured by an ample testimony of the public good opinion.

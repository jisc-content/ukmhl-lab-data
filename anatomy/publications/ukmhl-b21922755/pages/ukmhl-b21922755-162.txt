152 If a nerve be divided, or a portion be cut out, it is rendered for a time incapable of conveying volition, or any other mode of im- pression, to muscles. At length, however, the divided ends of the nerve will be united, or a new portion of nerve will be formed to supply what had been removed, and the power of exciting muscles to action will be recovered. If strong pressure be made upon any nerve, whether by a ligature, or by a tumour, or some other external cause, its power of ex- citing muscles to action is very much im- paired, and on some occasions may be lost. It will, however, be recovered after the pres- sure has been removed, but more or less slowly, according to the degree of injury which the nerve had sustained. The most common cause which impairs in nerves the power of exciting muscles to action, is that change which is called para- lysis. This sometimes originates in some pressure upon the brain, but very often it belongs merely to the nerves themselves. Sometimes there are only a very few nerves affected with this morbid change, but it very

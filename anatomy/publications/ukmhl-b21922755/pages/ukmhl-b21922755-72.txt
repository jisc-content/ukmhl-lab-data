62 It is not, however, sufficient for the purpose of examining into animal structure, that the vision should be more acute, but further that the parts should be so developed as to be more fitted for observation. This comprehends the art of preparation, which was not at all known among the early anatomists. Such an art would arise gradually, beginning with what was least artificial, and what might be observed in natural processes. The skeleton would therefore be the first sort of prepara- tion, being suggested by the frequent expo- sure of the carcases of animals, where the flesh has been dissolved away by putrefaction and the bones have been left bare. This would soon be followed by the preservation of some of the soft parts. It must have been observed that the flesh of animals, when not very bulky and free from fat, became upon exposure to the air so thoroughly dry as not afterwards to imbibe moisture, and could then be preserved for any length of time. The power of certain anti- septic substances must have been known; and anatomists must have heard something of the mode of embalming among the Egyp-

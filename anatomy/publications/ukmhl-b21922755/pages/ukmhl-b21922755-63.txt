53 prior to that mentioned by Glisson, he must still remain in possession of the honour. Although the lymphatic vessels were now certainly discovered, yet anatomists were en- tirely ignorant of their use, and their relation to the absorbent system. They considered them as appendages to the arteries, and sup- posed that they served the purpose of carry- ing back the watery part of the blood. There was, therefore, still room for a most important discovery in the physiology of these vessels. This was reserved for Dr. Hunter, who taught, so early as the year 1747, that the lymphatic vessels were not continuations of arteries, but were the real absorbents, arising from every surface and interstice of the body, and that they were a part of the same system of vessels with the lacteals, forming together one general system of absorbent vessels. This he proved by the strongest arguments, drawn as well from the minute injection of blood vessels, while the absorbents were not filled, as from the resemblance of the lymphatic to lacteal vessels, and their termination in the same common trunk. This discovery has been claimed by a celebrated professor of anatomy in Edinburgh; but I shall avoid entering

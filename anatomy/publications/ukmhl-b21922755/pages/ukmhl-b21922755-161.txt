151 them, the application of stimuli is known to be capable of exciting them to motion. Thus, if an hydatid from the liver of a sheep be put into water heated to the decree of heat of the human body, motion will be excited in it. This may be supposed either to depend upon fibrils so very minute as to elude ob- servation, which are impressed by the con- tact of the heated water; or it may be sup- posed that a nervous matter is mixed through its whole substance, without any nerves being formed, which nervous matter receives the same impression, and communicates it to the muscular structure. It is perhaps im- possible to ascertain this point anatomically, and therefore every thing which can be said concerning it must be considered as merely conjectural. These are the principal impressions which are known to be conveyed along nerves, and to excite muscles to contraction. They may be interrupted by a variety of accidents, which are of the same kind as those which sometimes interrupt the progress of impres- sions to the brain, and thereby prevent the different sensations from taking place.

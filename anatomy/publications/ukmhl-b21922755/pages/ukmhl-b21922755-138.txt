128 respect like healthy nerves. They would seem only to have lost the power of taking on that state which is necessary for convey- ing impressions to the brain; but as we cannot tell what that state really is, we must be unable to discover what is the particular de- fect in the nerves which are so incapacitated. We know from experience that nerves re- cover themselves very slowly from this state, and in most instances very imperfectly. Changes are occasionally observed in the structure of nerves which are incapable of conveying impressions. I recollect a re- markable instance of this in one of the optic nerves, which was of a much smaller size than usual, and had entirely lost the common medullary appearance, being converted into a blueish, half-transparent matter. Under such circumstances of change it is probable that nerves will never recover their power of conveying impressions. When an impression is carried along nerves to the brain, we are totally unacquainted with the change produced there, in order that sensation may take place. We cannot tell whether it is a change produced only at

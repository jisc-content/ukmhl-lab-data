These are employed in carrying on functions which are intimately connected with life, and where there would have been a great disadvantage if they had been at all dependent on volition. Of this kind is the muscular structure of the heart and blood-vessels; and of the same kind, likewise, is the muscular structure of the stomach and bowels. The first of these structures is employed in the distribution of blood over the body; and the other in pre- paring a fluid capable of being converted into blood, which is intended to supply its waste, besides expelling the excrementitious matter. Had either of these operations been dependent on volition, they would have re- quired constant attention in order to be car- ried on, and therefore the mind could not have emplo}red itself in other pursuits ; they would frequently have been managed very imperfectly, and would have run much risk of being altogether stopt.

64 of the body, of clearing vessels from fat and parenchyma, of filling cavities with air, and, what was still more wonderful, of drying in the air moist bodies ; and he was very liberal in permitting his preparations to be seen/' By this quotation from Swammerdam we see the state of the art of making prepara- tions before that of injection had been dis- covered, and it is obvious how imperfect it was. Parts are in some measure confounded together and shrunk by being dried, so as to show nothing of structure; and this method can be used only in preserving whole parts, which are better examined and understood by fresh dissection. The art of separating by maceration in water would teach more; but it requires great care that the parts be properly unravelled, and that nothing be lost. This is therefore liable to considerable diffi- culties, and can at best only reach to a cer- tain degree of accuracy. It cannot show the distinction between small empty vessels and fibres, so as to reach to the very minute structure of parts; and we must therefore look to the discovery of other means more adequate to this end. Such means are af-

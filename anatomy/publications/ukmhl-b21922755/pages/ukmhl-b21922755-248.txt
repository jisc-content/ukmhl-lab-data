23 8 symptoms which denote a local affection of a vital organ, but very frequently there are symptoms which indicate an inflammatory action of some of the viscera in the chest or belly, or of the brain. In these fevers I have met with no reme- dies which possess any specific powers of cure, or which are capable of shortening in any material degree their duration. Before they are fully formed they are sometimes cut short by an emetic, by active purgatives, by profuse perspiration, or by cold affusion ; but when they are quite established, I do not re- collect that I have seen any instance in which they have been shortened by these means. The most successful method of treating these fevers, as far as I have seen, is to remove or mitigate the symptoms as they arise. The symptoms denoting an affection of the brain should be relieved as speedily as possible by cupping, leeches, and the application of cold to the head. Cloths dipped in iced water, and kept almost constantly applied to the shaved scalp, have appeared to me more ef- fectual in removing delirium than any other remedy.

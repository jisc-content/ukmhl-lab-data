91 And success as well as character depends on attention to education. It is an ill-founded notion, arising from deserved disappointment, to say that merit is neglected. It is some- times joined with circumstances that may have some influence in counteracting it, as for instance an unfortunate temper, or a dis- agreeable manner; but generally it meets with its due reward. The world does not often judge erroneously; persons of merit have at least the best chance of success ; and who would be ambitious of the public appro- bation, if it had not the power of discrimi- nating ? Thus you see, Gentlemen, that you are at present in a very critical situation, and that almost every thing depends upon your own exertions. A teacher can do little more than point out the proper road to improve- ment. I trust you will not be backward in doing justice to yourselves, and I hope you will not find here any want of attention, or even of enthusiasm in your service.

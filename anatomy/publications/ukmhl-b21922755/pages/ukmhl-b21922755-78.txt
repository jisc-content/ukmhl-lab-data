Not long after this period injections were much employed by some anatomists; and Ruysch*, especially, carried this art to a very high degree of perfection. He exhibited to the world the specimens of his skill, but he could not prevail on himself to be so liberal as to discover the secret. A writer of his life, speaking of the perfection of his art, has said, “ Tali arte conclita cadavera per plurimos servabat annos, at dormire potius quarn mortua viderentur.” While the injection remains surrounded by a quantity of fleshy substance, although it may give an idea of general vascularity, yet it is obvious that the course and number of single vessels must be obscured. This disadvantage would be most striking in fleshy and very vascular parts, such as the glands of the body; and it suggested another im- provement,—that of destroying the flesh which surrounded the injection, so as to leave it # Ruysch was born at Haye in 1638.

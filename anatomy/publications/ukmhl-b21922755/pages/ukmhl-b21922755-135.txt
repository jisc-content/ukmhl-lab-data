Whatever be the variety in the modes of impression, the same general rule is still applicable, and the impression must be made in some form or other. Secondly, a communication by nerves must exist between the brain and that part of the body where the impression is made. There is no other medium through which an impression can be communicated; and it may be interrupted by a variety of causes, which will be very soon explained. It is very na- tural to inquire whether there be any change produced in a nerve when conveying im- pressions? In answer to this we may say, that there is no change whatever produced in the external appearance of a nerve during this part of its function; but what change may take place in its very minute structure, is probably much too subtile to be detected. The particular state of nerve which takes place while it is conveying impressions to the brain, may be interrupted or destroyed by various causes.

Others have supposed that it was a glan- dular substance. There is no satisfactory evidence, however, in support of this opi- nion ; and if we consider the analogy between it and the structures in the body which we know to be glandular, we shall be led to the belief that this opinion also is ill-founded. Some modern anatomists and naturalists have examined the cortical substance with microscopes of very great magnifying powers, but the result of their observations has been different,â€”a strong proof that much depen- dence is not to be placed on their accuracy.

With regard to myself, I cannot trust my own accuracy in making very minute microscopical observations; and

109 where they seem from their outside to be formed of medullary matter only, upon cut- ting into them they are found to have a mix- ture of the cortical. The cortical is some- times in a large proportion, as in the thalami nervorum opticorum, and pedes hippocampi; and sometimes it is in a smaller proportion, as in the tuberculum annulare, and the crura of the cerebrum. I hardly think that there is any particular structure of the brain com- posed purely of the one kind of substance or of the other, although the proportions of each in the various parts may be venf different. Of the intimate structure of the cortical substance I believe very little is satisfactorily known. Some have thought it to consist of nothing else than a congeries of very fine blood-vessels. It is evident, however, that no mere collection of vessels could be made to resemble the cortical substance. The pul- piness so remarkable in that substance could not be produced by a simple collection of vessels, however minute; nor can one ima- gine a collection of vessels to have the same properties with any part of the brain. When a part of the cortical substance is injected

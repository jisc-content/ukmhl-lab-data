112 parated from each other by a thin medullary septum. It has been thought by a distin- guished modern anatomist, that there is a re- gular aperture of communication between them, under the anterior extremity of the fornix; but other anatomists have been un- successful in detecting this direct mode of communication. The other cavities, called the third and fourth ventricles, are much smaller than the former, and communicate together by a small short canal. Connected with the brain, or its mem- branes, there are some small bodies of a pecu- liar structure. These are the pineal gland, the pituitary gland with its infundibulum, and some small white bodies adhering to the pia mater and the dura mater, which have been named the glands of Pacchionus. Of their minute structure, or their use, nothing is di- stinctly known. The brain is very plentifully supplied with blood, but this is not carried in an equal pro- portion to every part of its structure. The cortical substance has a much greater pro- portion carried to it than the medullary; and indeed blood-vessels seem to pass only

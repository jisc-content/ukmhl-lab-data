LECTURE II. HAVING given in the former lecture a very general view of the anatomy of the nervous system, we now come to the explanation of the purposes to which it is subservient. There is hardly any part of physiology at- tended with more difficulties in its investi- gation, or more imperfectly known, than that of the nervous system. We may be said to be entirely ignorant of the uses of particular modes of structure, both in the brain and nerves. The distinct use of the cortical and medullary substances in the brain has not been hitherto discovered. We are, if possible, less acquainted with the uses of their particular modifications and mixtures in the different parts of the brain. Why they are formed, for instance, into con- volutions upon the surface of the cerebrum, and into concentric laminae upon the surface

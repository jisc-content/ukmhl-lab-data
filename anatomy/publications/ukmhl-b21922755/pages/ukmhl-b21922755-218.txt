208 tentive examination of the living body, no difficulty would remain in ascertaining the disease. This, however, will very seldom happen; for I have not found a single in- stance in all the dead bodies which I have examined, of the pancreas being so large that it could have been ascertained by the most careful examination in the living body. If the pancreas were to be much increased in size, and the patient much emaciated, so as to ascertain this disease while the patient was alive, it would probably be in general too late to receive any substantial benefit from medicine. Calculi formed in the ducts of the pancreas constitute a still rarer disease than the inflam- mation or enlargement of this gland. I have not myself met with any instance of it in the living body, nor do I remember to have heard any physician say that he has seen this disease. While the calculi remain within the ducts of the pancreas, it is evident that no solvent could reach them ; and if they should be discharged into the duodenum, there would be a cessation of the disease for a time.

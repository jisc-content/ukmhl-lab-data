Ill I frankly own that 1 am totally unacquainted with the minute structure of this substance. The structure of the medullary substance is rather better known. In some parts of the brain, as the pons varolii, crura cerebri, &c., it appears evidently fibrous; and therefore in other parts, where the fibrous texture can hardly be detected, it is very probable that there is the same kind of structure. The fibres may be so small, and so uniformly ap- plied to each other, as to escape observation. With regard to the minuter structure of the medullary substance, I believe that nothing satisfactory is known. By some modern ob- servers its minute structure has been thought to be the same with that of the cortical. In the brain there are four cavities of a considerable size, which are called ventricles. These are surrounded by distinct and peculiar structures of the brain, and contain a little water. This water is more limpid than what is found in the other cavities of the body, and very little or no coagulable matter is dissolved in it. The two largest of these cavities have been called the lateral ventricles, and they are se-

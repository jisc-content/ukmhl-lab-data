37 ment from the valves formed at its origin. “ Membranis quibusdam ad ostia vasorum ap- positis, ut impediant retrocession ” Still, how- ever, he was entirely ignorant of the con- nexion between the arteries and the veins, and that the blood passes from the one to the other on its return to the heart. We have here a difficulty striking only an observing mind ; and many ages might have elapsed without the discovery of the circu- lation, if there had not arisen some pene- trating genius, such as that of Harvey. Before we come to speak of the complete discovery of the circulation, it will be neces- sary to mention the discovery of the valves of the veins, which so much tended to facili- tate it. In the cavities of veins are placed little processes, which are so contrived as to allow the blood to pass readily from every part of the body towards the heart, but most effectually prevent an opposite course. These processes consist of very fine membranes, which, when the veins are empty, fall col- lapsed upon their coats, so as easily to es- cape observation. This will account for their not being known to the very early anatomists,

49 sorbents, had been noticed by anatomists. Eustachius had many years before seen it in the chest of a horse, and had called it vena alba thoracis. It remained still, however, to make the same progress in the human subject. Veslingius is said to have observed in the year 1634 the lacteal vessels in man, and in the year 1649 the thoracic duct. This duct was afterwards brought to the general knowledge of anatomists by Peirish and Van Horne, and the lacteals were soon traced to their termination in it. The whole route of the chyle was in this manner completed in the human subject, which entirely overthrew the ancient idea, that the liver was employed in forming blood. The lacteals, however, form only a small part of the absorbent system ; it extends over the whole body, absorbent vessels taking their origin from all cavities, and surfaces, and interstices. Much, therefore, still re- mained to be discovered ; and Olaus Rud- beck, a Swede*, has the honour of being the # Olaus Rudbeck, born at Arosa in 16S0. E

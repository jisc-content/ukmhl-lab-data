236 worth while to make a trial of this remedy. When the Dropsy of the ovarium is composed of several cysts, the disease may be partially relieved by tapping; but it almost con- stantly returns, and after a certain time very rapidly, so that there is only a short in- terval between the operations. Still, how- ever, some relief is afforded by each opera- tion ; and patients will be ready to undergo the operation for this relief every two or three months for several years. A firm swelling, about the size of the fist or a large orange, is sometimes to be felt in the situation of the ovarium, either upon the right or the left side of the abdomen. It will sometimes remain stationary, will sometimes go on enlarging to a much greater size, and is not, as far as I have seen, suppressed by any remedy. This solid structure of the ovarium is found not uncommonly blended with the dropsical cysts which have been lately mentioned.

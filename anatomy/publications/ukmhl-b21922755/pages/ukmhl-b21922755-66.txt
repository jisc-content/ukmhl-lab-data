56 different orders of animals, very much con- firming the idea that it was sufficient of itself to carry on the purposes of absorption in the body. These ideas of the absorbent system began very soon, at least in this country, to be generally adopted, though it was still be- lieved to be confined in its action to the absorption of fluids. Mr. John Hunter ex- tended the influence of its action to the solids, which he deduced from the various changes in the growth of the body, and the different effects that take place in many dis- eases of the solids. This opinion is beginning at present to be generally received; and the merit of having first formed it has been claimed by the same distinguished professor before alluded to, but no sufficient evidence has been offered in support of this claim. In viewing the present state of our know- ledge concerning the absorbent system, it appears that the phamomena of its action are tolerably well understood; but the course of particular vessels has not been traced in every part of the body. This is a work of much patience and of considerable difficulty;

LECTURE III. THE nerves are not only employed in con- veying impressions to the mind, so as to pro- duce sensations, but also in conveying the influence of the brain to the different parts of the body which are capable of being ex- cited into motion. These parts of the body are called muscular, and have a peculiar or- ganization, which it would be foreign to our present purpose to explain. The nerves are capable of being variously impressed, so as to excite muscles into motion. The most common influence which is con- veyed along nerves to excite the action of muscles is volition. We do not understand what is the particular state, either of the brain while volition is exerted, or of the nerve while an influence is conveyed along it to muscles ; and both of these subjects are perhaps be- yond the boundary of human investigation.

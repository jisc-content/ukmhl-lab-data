by exposing all of them together; and a wound that penetrated into the brain, or into the chest or belly, would give some general knowledge of internal parts. A more extensive source, however, of ana- tomical knowledge, would be derived from the more common and domestic animals. When animals were killed for food, they would aft'ord a considerable opportunity of anato- mical observation ; and men would naturally transfer the anatomy of such animals to the human subject, being led by a strong ana- logy from circumstances of general resem- blance. The custom of sacrificing to the gods, and particularly that of examining the viscera of animals in order to form a presage of future events, would add considerably to the stock of anatomical knowledge. By this time men had emerged from the rudest state of barba- rism, had acquired some degree of civiliza- tion, and had become more curious, as well as better fitted, to observe what might come before them. The custom itself obliged them to attend more closely to appearances, and to observe varieties, which would give a consi-

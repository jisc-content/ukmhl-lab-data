55 the absorption of the body, forcibly struck the mind of Mr. John Hunter, and he im- mediately instituted experiments to confirm or overthrow it. For this purpose he made many experiments on living animals, by throwing different fluids into the intestines for absorption; and found that the lacteals al- ways became filled with the fluid, but never the veins. The same opinion he confirmed also by injections, so as to establish it be- yond a doubt. All the observations and experiments re- lating to absorbent vessels had been hitherto confined to quadrupeds ; and although it was natural to conclude that they likewise be- longed to the other orders of animals, yet the subject was incomplete till this point was determined. Examinations were accordingly made for the purpose. Mr. John Hunter discovered absorbent vessels in birds and in amphibious animals; and these discoveries were extended by the late Mr. John Hewson, who was the first to ascertain the existence of absorbent vessels in fishes. In this manner were enlarged the views of the absorbent system, by showing that it belonged to all the

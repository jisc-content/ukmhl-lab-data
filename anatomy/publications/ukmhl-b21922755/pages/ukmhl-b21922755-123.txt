113 through the latter to get at the former. There is no reason to suppose that the blood carried to the brain is different from the blood of the rest of the body, although this has been the opinion of some physiologists; but it is here conducted with more contrivance than any where else, in order to diminish its momentum. . * / The blood of the brain is conveyed to it by four arteries of a large size ; these are the two internal carotid, and the two vertebral arteries. The blood in all of these is much checked in its impetus as it is about to pass into the cranium. The horizontal and varied channel of the canalis caroticus must exceed- ingly diminish the momentum of the blood in the branches of the internal carotid ar- teries ; and the winding course of the ver- tebral arteries between the atlas and the cra- nium, before they enter at the foramen mag- num occipitale, must have the same effect upon the current of blood passing through the branches of these vessels. The junction, too, of the internal carotid arteries, and the basilary round the sella turcica, must be sub- servient to the same purpose. It may be i

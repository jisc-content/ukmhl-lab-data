When the urine has been evacuated, and has been allowed to rest in a vessel for a little time, the purulent mucus subsides from the urine, and often adheres with considerable tenacity to the sides of the vessel. This mucus is often formed, without there being any morbid structure in the bladder, or any substance contained in the bladder which produces irritation; but it almost constantly attends more or less the presence of a calculus there.

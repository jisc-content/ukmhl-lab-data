63 tians. Some art, upon the same principle, would naturally be transferred to the pre- servation of parts for anatomical purposes. Many of the soft parts too, when left acci- dentally in water for a considerable time, would be found to separate, and their minuter structure to be evolved; and this would na- turally suggest the employment of similar means for the more accurate examination of structure. Such modes of preparation re- quired little art, and were pressed upon the attention from many common occurrences; and we find, accordingly, that this was the state of progress in preparations among the early anatomists, even a long time after they had been accustomed to dissections. Swammerdam, in speaking of the advance of this branch of anatomy, has said, â€œ that in the art of preserving parts, Van Horne ex- celled all other anatomists ; and that next to him was De Bils, who showed his industry by drying the muscles of the whole body, and covering them with balsam. Hallpert Vander Wiel succeeded him, the scholar of Van Horne, and much superior both to him and De Bils. He knew the art of varnishing over the parts

99 early period different from what it is when the child has made a further progress, and especially when it has arrived at the adult state. In a child before birth, and even for some time afterwards, the brain is capable of sustaining a great degree of pressure without injury; and indeed this was necessary on ac- count of the compression to which it was to be exposed in passing through the pelvis; but the adult brain can hardly bear the smallest pressure without mischief. The brain in the human subject, as well as in many other orders of animals, is inclosed in a bony case, called the cranium, which is intended for its protection. The degree of protection depends upon the thickness of the bones, and this thickness becomes greater as the protection becomes more necessary. It is very obvious that an animal can hardly be constructed so as to be protected against all degrees of violence. The thickness of the bones of the cranium is therefore suited to the degrees of violence which generally occur. Where the bones of the cranium are most exposed to injury from external violence, with fewer means of natural defence, there n 2

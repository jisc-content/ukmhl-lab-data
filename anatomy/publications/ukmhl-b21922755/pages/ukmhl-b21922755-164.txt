154 body are thrown into strong and repeated contractions, or may be continued in a state of permanent contraction. In neither of these cases are the muscles at all influenced by volition ; and however strongly it may be exerted to moderate the contractions, the ef- fort is attended with no effect. On many occasions the cause of these complaints can- not be ascertained, although it is generally supposed to be some strong excitement ap- plied to the brain. In some cases it has been found by examination after death to be a mechanical stimulus applied,â€”as for in- stance, a little bony process growing from the dura mater, and irritating the brain; and in cases of permanent contraction, it is al- most constantly found to be an irritation of some nerve, occasioned by a wound. Where the disease consists in a repetition of con- tractions, it is frequently in time removed, and therefore in such cases can hardly be supposed to depend upon any mechanical irritation applied to the brain. Where it consists in a permanent contraction, and where the cause is ascertained, the disease is most frequently fatal.

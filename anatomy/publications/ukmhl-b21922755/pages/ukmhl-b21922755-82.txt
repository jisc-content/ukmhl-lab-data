72 tended originally for the Scotch church; but disliking many circumstances in that profession, he was easily persuaded by his friend Dr. Cullen to turn his attention to the study of physic. He began his medical education under the direction of Dr. Cullen, at that time settled in Hamilton, with whom he lived some years; and he afterwards stu- died both in Edinburgh and London. It was intended that he should return to Dr. Cullen and take a share of his business; the one to practise surgery, and the other medicine : but Dr. Cullen very generously gave up the sidered by Dr. Hunter as the cleverest of the family; and I have heard him say that if James had lived, he thought nothing could have prevented him from being the first phy- sician in London. It would have been very remarkable to have seen at the same time three brothers at the head of the three departments of physic. James at the head of medicine, William of midwifery, and John of surgery. Dr. Hunterâ€™s father was occasionally obliged to sell portions of his estate, to meet the necessary expenses of so large a family, though managed with great frugality. This increased the constitu- tional anxiety of his mind; and he was often kept awake in the night by thinking on the difficulties of his situation. Those portions of the estate which had been sold were many years afterwards repurchased by Dr. Hunter, when he had acquired some fortune from the exercise of his profession.

In the present times they have risen to the notice which they de- serve, since they are employed for as impor- tant purposes as any in the animal economy. The principles of their action are probably as well understood as that of the blood-ves- sels, but their particular anatomy is more imperfectly known. It appears clearly from the testimony of Galen that white vessels had been seen by Erasistratus on the mesentery of kids. This, however, was not a discovery, for he did not distinguish them from veins; he had only observed what was presented to his eyes, without making any conjecture; and it was very long indeed after his time before they were known as a separate order of vessels.

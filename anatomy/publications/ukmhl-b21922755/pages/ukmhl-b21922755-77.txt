67 tion uniformly through the minuter branches of a vessel. These two requisites were soon supplied by the ingenuity of two different persons. De Graaf*, a Dutch anatomist, about the middle of the seventeenth century invented the syringe, by which the force em- ployed to throw the injection into vessels can be applied in a sufficient degree, and pro- perly regulated. This very much resembles the syringe at present used; but the pipe he employed was curved and was much longer. The proper materials of injection were dis- covered by Swammerdam-)' a little after this period; for De Graaf recommends the use of metallic solutions. In his Miraculum Naturee, Swammerdam has mentioned the composition of his injec- tion, which is as follows : â€œ Take of white wax what is sufficient; melt it, and mix with it when melted a red, yellow, green, or any other colour which may be reckoned most suitable; draw up the in- jection with a syringe, and inject it into an * De Graaf was born at Schoonhaven in Holland in 1641. i* Swammerdam was born at Amsterdam in 1637.

130 causes, and generally make a slow progress. It is also not improbable that changes may take place throughout the general structure of the brain, by which it may be unfitted to receive impressions from the nerves, or will receive them very imperfectly. We know that the brain is frequently changed from its healthy structure, so as to receive false im- pressions, as in many instances of mania; and therefore we may suppose that there are certain changes by which it may be incapa- citated from receiving impressions distinctly, or perhaps from receiving them at all. If, however, there be such changes, they are, I believe, at present not well ascertained. Most parts of the body are only capable of conveying different impressions which produce sensations of pain. These are very different in the same parts, according to the degree or the mode of the impression,â€”so that sensations of pain vary a good deal. There are some parts of the body where the sensations of pain may be said to be pecu- liar, as for example that of the testicle upon pressure. Were patients in general capable of comparing accurately these sensations,

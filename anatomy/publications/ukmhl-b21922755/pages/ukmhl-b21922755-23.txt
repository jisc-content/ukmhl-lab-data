His great thirst after knowledge, and his extraordinary opportunities, could not fail of procuring him a most distinguished repu- tation ; so that he became a guide and autho- rity to future anatomists, as may be gathered from what remains of his observations in the works of Galen. It would appear that he had seen on the mesentery of kids some lacteal vessels filled with chyle, which he has described with great exactness, although shortly, and without form- ing any conjecture about their real use.

100 they are thicker. Where they are protected by a thick application of muscles, or by the instinctive defence of the arms, they are thinner. Accordingly, at the posterior pro- jecting part of the cranium the bones are thicker than any where else. Nature is will- ing to do enough; but wherever the for- mation of bony matter may be safely spared, it does not take place. There is a long process derived from the brain, consisting of the same matter with the brain itself, and requiring the same protec- tion, viz. the medulla oblongata and spinalis. The first is inclosed in the bones of the era- nium, along with the brain ; and the other is lodged in a canal surrounded with bone, so as to be equally protected. This canal is situated in the spine, and the bones compo- sing it are so firmly connected together, as hardly to be liable to any risk either of dislo- cation or of compression from angles being formed by the motion of the bones upon each other. Although the general amount of the motion of the spine is very consi- derable, yet the motion allowed between any two contiguous bones is very small.

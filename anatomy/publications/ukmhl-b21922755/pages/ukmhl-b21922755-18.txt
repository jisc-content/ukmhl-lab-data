Men had not then learned that it required a full investigation of facts before opinions could be justly formed, and princi- ples established; a circumstance too often overlooked even in modern times. Under such circumstances, it was impos- sible that the knowledge of anatomy should rapidly advance. It made a part only of na- tural history, claiming the attention of philo- sophers generally amidst other objects, but had not yet been detached, becoming a sepa- rate branch of inquiry. This is an improve- ment which cannot be made till knowledge has considerably advanced. The little that is known at first of the different branches of science does not require division and ar- rangement ; and it is only the accumulation of facts that can point out their utility. This improvement in physic happened in the time of Hippocrates; and anatomy there- fore began naturally about this period to be cultivated by a particular class of men. We are then to consider this era as remarkable in the history of anatomy and physic; for it laid the foundation of their more rapid progress

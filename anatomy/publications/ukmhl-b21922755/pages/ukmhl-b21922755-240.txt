In this disease no permanent advantage is gained by medicine. The strength of the constitution may be a little kept up by tonic and astringent medicines, and the profuse discharges of mucus and blood may be moderated by the application of cold and astringent fluids; but the disease can only be removed by an operation, which consists in tying the neck of the polypus by a liga- ture. This can be done safely, and with great dexterity by many practitioners in mid- wifery. In a few days after the operation, the polypus drops off, and the patient gra- dually recovers her usual health. In many instances the polypus does not return ; but a new polypus is occasionally formed, which in due time may be removed by a similar ope- ration.

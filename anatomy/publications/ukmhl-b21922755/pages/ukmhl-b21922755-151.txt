141 We know that to the eye there is no ap- parent change in a nerve when conducting volition, and it is probable that there is also none in the brain while this power of the mind is exercised. The change, therefore, must take place in the very minute structure of the parts, which cannot be an object of examination. It is remarkable, that although the effect of volition upon muscles, when con- veyed along nerves to them, is that of their being put into motion; yet the volition is never exerted towards the muscles them- selves, but towards that change which is in- tended to be produced by their action. One might naturally be inclined to think that the volition would be directed to the muscles themselves which are called into action.

Were volition to be directed towards the muscles themselves, it would be necessary to understand what muscles ought to be called into action, in order to produce every variety of change in the motions of the body of which it may be capable. This, however, would be totally impossible in an infant, and indeed

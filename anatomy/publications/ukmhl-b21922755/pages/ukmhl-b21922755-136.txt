126 the matter of the nerve between the seat of the impression and the brain. Hence, if a portion of a nerve be cut out, it becomes unfit for conveying impressions ; and even if it be merely divided, the same incapacity takes place. The application of the divided parts to each other, so as to be closely in contact, will produce no change in the effect, for the impression will not pass from the one to the other. Some persons have supposed that when a portion of any nerve was divided, it not only lost its power of conveying im- pressions, but never recovered it. This opi- nion is, however, ill-founded; there can be no doubt of the real matter of nerve being re- generated; and there have been well-marked instances of nerves, after being divided, reco- vering their capability of conveying impres- sions, although they recover it very slowly. When a ligature is made upon any nerve, it is also rendered incapable of conveying impressions to the brain. That particular state of nerve which takes place while it is performing this function is prevented by the ligature from being propagated to the brain, so that this organ receives no impression.

102 The dura mater consists of fasciculi of white fibres compacted into a firm membrane. These are more readily observable upon the outside of the dura mater than on its inside, because there they are coarser. The internal surface of the dura mater is finer and of a more shining colour than the external; and here the fibrous structure is less observable, except in particular situations, where coarse fasciculi are interwoven with the membrane, in order to give it greater strength. The dura mater may in some degree be consi- dered as consisting of two laminae,â€”a coarser upon the outside, and a finer upon the in- side ; but these cannot be separated from each other, so as to leave natural surfaces. A number of fibres are always seen passing between the one and the other, by which they are united. The dura mater in its use is partly to be referred to the cranium itself, and partly to the brain which it envelopes. It is the prin- cipal source of nourishment to the cranium ; and in separating the dura mater from the bone, a prodigious number of fine vessels are ruptured, which pass from the one to

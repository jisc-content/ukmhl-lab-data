108 is sometimes distinctly marked and some- times obscurely, and has, I believe, been very little, if at all, observed by authors. The concentric laminae upon the surface of the cerebellum are composed also of cortical and medullary matter. By this contrivance the quantity of cortical substance, as well as the extent of its surface upon the outer part of the brain, is very much increased, but with what view has not been hitherto dis- covered. When the cerebrum is divided at the lower surface of the hemispheres, and upon a level with what is commonly called the corpus cal- losum, there is seen a large oval plane of me- dullary substance, which is skirted on the outside by the convoluted cortical substance. A little deeper than this plane, where you come to cavities of a considerable size, and bodies of regular but various shapes, there are many different mixtures of the cortical and medullary matter. Where bodies seem from their outside to be formed of cortical sub- stance only, upon cutting into them there appears to be a considerable mixture of me- dullary matter, as in the corpora striata; and

This passage in Servetus seems, however, to have been overlooked by anatomists in general; and from most of their writings it would appear that no hint had yet been caught about the true circulation. Not long afterwards, Columbus also made out the lesser circulation through the lungs. He was professor of anatomy at Padua, and had been a scholar of Vesalius. It is impos- sible to determine whether he might not have been acquainted with the opinion of Servetus; but we have the testimony of himself for its being a discovery of his own, which we ought not to refuse. In a part of his works he has said, 66 There is a septum between the ventricles of the heart, through which every person thinks there is a passage to the blood from the right to the left ventricle.

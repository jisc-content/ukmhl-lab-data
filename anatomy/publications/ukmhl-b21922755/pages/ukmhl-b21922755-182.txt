OF SOME DISEASES OF THE NECK. The most common disease in the neck is the swelling of one or more lymphatic glands. This is most apt to take place in young per- sons who have fair complexions and delicate constitutions. It is always a very tedious disease, and is seldom much benefited by medicine. The remedies which I have found of most use have been sarsaparilla com- bined with soda, Peruvian bark combined with soda, and some form of steel. These medicines will, however, often have but a very imperfect influence upon the complaint. Sea air and tepid sea-water bathing are often be- neficial ; but I think that the air and waters of Malvern are more useful than any other remedy. I have known a good many cases which had been but little improved by the com- mon remedies, and by a residence upon the sea coast with all its advantages, which have afterwards got quite well by the patients re- siding three or four months at Malvern. o

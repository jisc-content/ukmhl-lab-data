101 W hen the bones of the cranium are at any part removed, the brain does not come im- mediately into view, but there is a series of membranes which surround it. The most external has been named the dura mater. This is a membrane of great firmness, of a white colour, and with a few branches of ves- sels on each side ramifying upon it. It ad- heres very firmly to the cranium at every part, so as to require considerable force to separate it. This adhesion is chiefly by the medium of small branches of arteries, which pass from the membrane into the sub- stance of the bones of the cranium. The ad- hesion is likewise very much strengthened by the close application of the membrane itself to the inside of the bones, and especially by the membrane running into the foramina of the bones at the lower part of the cranium. The adhesion is always so firm, as to keep the dura mater closely applied to the inside of every part of the cranium; but sometimes it is praeternaturally strong. In this case it is impossible perfectly to separate the dura mater from the bone, and portions of the membrane will be left adhering to it.

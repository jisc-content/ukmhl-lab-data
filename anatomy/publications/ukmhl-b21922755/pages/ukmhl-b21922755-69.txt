59 would appear to be confined to what is readily observable. When the mind had, however, advanced further, and been enlight- ened by the general principles of natural philosophy, showing the infinite divisibility of matter, it would immediately occur that there was a large field of discovery, beyond what had formerly even been imagined, and a terra incognita lying open for research. This would appear the more important, as it must have occurred, whenever men were dis- posed to reason on the subject, that the ac- tions of an animal body are not to be referred to the larger parts, but to the smaller, of which these are composed. Hence the ex- amination of minute structure is evidently more connected with physiology ; and if ever the latter is to be known at all, it must be through the medium of the former. Anatomy was so far advanced as readily to receive these improvements about the time of Malpighi, an Italian anatomist, born near Bologna in the year 1638. In the early part of his life, before he cultivated medicine, he was singularly fond of philosophy, and it was probably this which led him to the application of the microscope to anatomical purposes.

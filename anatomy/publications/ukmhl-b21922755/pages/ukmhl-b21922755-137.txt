Every person has frequently experienced a temporary external pressure upon a particular nerve, when im- pressions have been conveyed imperfectly to the brain, in consequence of which there has been indistinct sensation. Tumours growing in the neighbourhood of nerves, especially hard tumours, occasionally produce the same effect. If such a nerve, or nerves, be near a bone, they may be so squeezed between the tumour and the bone as to convey im- pressions either very indistinctly, or entirely to lose this power. The causes just now enumerated as inter- rupting or destroying the power of nerves to convey impressions may be said to be ex- ternal, and exist where there is supposed to be no fault in the nerves themselves. There are changes also taking place in nerves, which produce the same incapacity. One of these changes is when the nerves of any part become paralytic. When this is the case, there is usually no alteration produced in their appearance, but they look in every

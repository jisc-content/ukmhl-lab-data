121 The organs of sense and of motion are the most plentifully supplied with nerves; the glands of the body, in many instances, spa- ringly; and tendons, ligaments, bones, &c., either not at all, or the nerves which reach them are so small as to prevent their being distinctly traced. In some parts of the body little swellings are occasionally formed in the nerves, which have been called ganglions. These have a very different appearance from a common portion of a nerve, being somewhat of a red- dish-brown colour, and having a minute fibrous texture. Some nerves in the body form an intimate junction with each other, which has been called a plexus. This is re- markably the case with the nerves of the upper and lower extremities, and also with the nerves which supply the abdominal vis- cera. To enter into a minute account either of the ganglions or plexuses of nerves, would carry us much beyond the limits of such a lecture ; and this inquiry would be the less satisfactory, as much upon both of these sub- jects is to be considered only as conjecture.

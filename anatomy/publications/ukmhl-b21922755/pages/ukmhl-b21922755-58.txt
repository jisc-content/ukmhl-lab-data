48 Although he had clearly distinguished the lacteals to be a particular system of vessels, yet he was mistaken about their termination; for he believed that they ended in the liver, the trunk of the absorbents being still unknown. Attention to this subject was now, however, awakened among anatomists, and the error of Asellius was soon corrected. Picquet traced the lacteals into the receptaculum chyli; and he has mentioned this subject very clearly, and with singular modesty. 66 It is to be at- tributed," says he, 46 to ill fortune rather than want of attention that anatomists should not know the chyle is neither carried to the liver, nor the vena porta, nor the vena cava, near the emulgents, as is the general opinion : but any one by dissection may perceive, as clearly as sunshine, that the lacteal vessels pass from the intestines to a certain receptacle, which, in brutes at least, occupies the space between the \pocci.‚Äù From the receptaculum chyli he traced the trunks of the absorbents to their termination in veins, so as to discover the whole route of the chyle. This, however, was only in brutes; nor was it the first time that the thoracic duct, or trunk of the ab-

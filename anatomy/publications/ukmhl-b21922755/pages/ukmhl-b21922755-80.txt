70 fection. Every part of the body large enough to be examined by the naked eye has been often noted and described, and magnifying- glasses have been for a long time employed to develope the minuter structure. Much, however, still remains to be done in physi- ology. There is scarcely a great function going on in the human body which is clearly understood. The uses of respiration, the change of the food into chyle, and of the chyle into blood, the impregnation of the female, the mode of action in the nervous system, the mode of action in muscles, are all as yet very imperfectly known. These functions go on apart from observation, and depend upon the action of the minutest parts of the body. What still remains to be known can only be accomplished by a long chain of ju- dicious experiments; and probably some of them will baffle the utmost efforts of human ingenuity. It is our duty, however, to go on. Experiments are every day affording new light, and enlarging the bounds of knowledge. Anatomy has of late years been much more cultivated in this island than formerly. This has been very much owing to Dr. Hunter,

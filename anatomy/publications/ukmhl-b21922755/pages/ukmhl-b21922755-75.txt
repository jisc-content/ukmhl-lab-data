65 forded by the art of injection. In its be- ginning this was very rude and imperfect; but it has gradually advanced to very great perfection, and has become the chief means of developing the smaller component parts of an animal body. Indeed, the advantages arising from the invention of the art of in- jection are almost incredible. It has shown the course of the smaller branches of vessels, and the comparative vascularity of parts; has displayed the structure of many glands; has confirmed the doctrine of the circulation; has discovered the mode of union between the vessels of the mother and the child during pregnancy; and has assisted in disproving the connexion between absorbents and blood- vessels. This invention becomes therefore an object of considerable magnitude, even in a very general history of the progress of anatomy. Very simple and imperfect means of in- jecting vessels were at first employed. Air was inflated to distend them, or some co- loured fluid was thrown in ; as milk, quick- silver, ink, and solutions of metals. Such means were liable to many inconveniences. F

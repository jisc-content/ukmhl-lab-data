116 the spine, and forming a convenient source for the nerves of the trunk and the extremi- ties. It consists of a conical flattened mass, terminating in a point at the upper end of the loins, and gives off a great number of nerves upon each side, at regular distances from each other. The nerves which arise from its lower extremity are very large, and consist of fibres but loosely connected to- gether, so as to bear some resemblance to a horseâ€™s tail; and from thence they have been called the cauda equina. The medulla spinalis, as well as the me- didla oblongata, consists of the same kind of substance with the brain itself, but differently arranged. The medullary substance is placed upon the outside, and the cortical within; and the proportion of the former to the latter is evidently greater than either in the cere- brum or the cerebellum. The medulla oblongata, lying within the cavity of the cranium, has of course the same coverings with the brain itself; and they are continued into the canal of the spine, accom- panying the spinal marrow. The dura mater in the canal of the spine has exactly the same

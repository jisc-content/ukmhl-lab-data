60 He was the first who pointed out a new field in anatomy, by the application of an instru- ment, which must however, at that time, have been employed for many purposes of natural philosophy. It had been invented about the beginning of the seventeenth century by a Dutchman*, and was probably coming into considerable use. As soon as the microscope was employed, it must have furnished new lights to anatomy. Malpighi accordingly made many new ob- servations. He examined the minute struc- ture of the parts most essential to life, espe- cially the organs of secretion, and gave a new opinion about their structure. This ex- ample excited other anatomists to pursue the same plan, till at length microscopical obser- vation went hand in hand with the larger and more palpable anatomy. Leeuwenhoeck, a Dutch anatomist f, who lived soon after the period of Malpighi, con- # Dribbel, a Dutchman, is said to have invented the mi- croscope in 1621. This invention is also claimed by Fon- tana, a Neapolitan. Malpighi used it for anatomical pur- poses about the year l66l. T Leeuwenhoeck was bom at Delft. He began his mi- croscopical observations in anatomy about the year 1680.

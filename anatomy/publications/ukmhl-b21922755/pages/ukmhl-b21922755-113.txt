103 the other. With regard to the brain, the dura mater seems to have two uses. The one is that of forming septa between different parts of the brain, so that one part shall not press too much upon another; and this is particularly observable in the septum, which divides the posterior part of the cerebrum from the cerebellum. The other use is that of forming considerable canals for carrying back the blood towards the heart. The dura mater consists of materials very well adapted for the formation of large channels in the neighbourhood of a substance so little able O to sustain pressure as the brain. These channels or sinuses are not capable of being- distended by blood in the same manner as %* common veins, and therefore there is no risk of any considerable pressure upon this im- portant organ. The brain can bear the pres- sure produced by the accumulation of blood in the small veins of the pia mater, when it is not carried to an extreme degree; but it could not bear the pressure arising from the dis- tension of veins of the same size as the larger sinuses of the dura mater. The dura mater was at one time supposed

This may perhaps be intended with the same general view, viz. that they may have little power to act upon the blood which they contain, so that it shall be propelled almost entirely by the force of the heart, which has already been very much moderated by the contrivances formerly men- tioned. The veins of the brain terminate in the different sinuses of the dura mater, the use of which particular structure we have already endeavoured to explain.

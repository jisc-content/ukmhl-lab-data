The vessels appear very numerous upon a successful injection, or when a part of the cortical substance is inflamed. The brain consists of the cerebrum and the cerebellum, and is formed of two kinds of substance, the cortical and the medullary substance. The first is of a cineritious, and the second of a pure white colour. There is a layer of the cortical substance placed on the outside of the brain: this does not form a smooth uniform plane, but in the cerebrum is moulded into convolutions, a good deal re- sembling the convolutions of the intestines; and in the cerebellum it is formed into con- centric laminae. The convolutions are of a considerable depth; and if any of them be cut through, it is seen to consist both of cor- tical and medullary substance. The cortical forms a layer of considerable thickness ; and if you look attentively upon its divided edge, there will be seen passing through it, and following it through all its windings, a very narrow lamina of medullary substance.

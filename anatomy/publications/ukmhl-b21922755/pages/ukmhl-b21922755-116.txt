106 1 dura mater; but in some they are connected, as in the neighbourhood of the larger sinuses of the dura mater, into which the veins of the pia mater pour their contents. To the in- ternal surface of the pia mater there are at- tached a great number of processes, which consist of a shaggy membrane crowded with very fine vessels. The vessels do not indis- criminately enter every part of the sub- stance of the brain ; but in the cerebrum they enter between its foldings, which have been named convolutions; and in the cere- bellum they enter between its concentric la- minae. Neither do they pass in an equal number to every part of the brain; but they chiefly carry their blood to the cortical sub- stance, and rather seem to pass through the medullary substance, in order to reach any cortical which may lie within it, than to ter- minate in the medullary substance itself. In cutting through a portion of the medullary substance, a great number of very fine ves- sels are divided; but these seem to be pass- ing through that substance, and not ramifying in it. When a portion of the cortical sub- stance is cut, there is no appearance of ves-

179 this conjecture, if well founded, may ex- plain the cause of there being such a variety of opinions upon the subject. A patient should, if possible, spend two or three suc- cessive winters abroad, in order to give the best chance of the disposition to the disease being subdued. When no active inflammation is going on in the chest in phthisis, I have sometimes found advantage from patients being allowed to take a little white fish or light animal food at dinner. In a very few instances I have found benefit derived from their taking one, or even two glasses of wine diluted with water, after dinner; but wine is generally improper. I have known of no medicine which has been of permanent and substantial use in phthisis ; but I have sometimes found a good deal of temporary advantage derived from myrrh, from ammonia, and from light bitters united to the acetic acid. The frequent re- petition of blisters, or a seton inserted under the skin in some part of the chest, are oc- casionally of considerable use. n 2

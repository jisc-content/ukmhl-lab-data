Thus, if the hand is put into water either hot or cold, the sensation re-, mains for some time after it has been taken out. This depends on the nerves continuing for some time in that particular state into which they had been thrown; and this state of nerve is conveyed to the brain, which pro- duces the continuance of sensation. Sensations are much varied in their de- gree of intensity by the sensations which im- mediately precede them, and in many in- stances are altogether changed.

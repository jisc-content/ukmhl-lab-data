214 their general health. The disease will return either from imprudence in diet or exercise, or without any known cause, and the patient will become as ill as ever. It very rarely happens that a patient permanently recovers from this disease, and I do not at present re- collect an instance of it. Medicines, as far as my experience has reached, do not pro- duce any great or permanent good effect. A seton inserted in the loins, or in the flank of that side where the diseased kidney is si- tuated, is sometimes of considerable use. The uva ursi, and the tinctura benzoes com- posita, have sometimes been serviceable as internal medicines. The same observations may extend to cooling and mucilaginous re- medies. Great quiet of body and uniform temperate living are useful in mitigating symptoms, and retarding the progress of the disease. A patient labouring under this complaint should live almost entirely upon vegetable food, and should abstain from wine and other fermented liquors.

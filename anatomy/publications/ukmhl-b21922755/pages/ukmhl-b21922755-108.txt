98 as the horse, the ox, &c., the difference is very striking. The brain does not bear the same relative proportion to the size of the body in the very early periods of growth, and in the adult state. In a child at birth the brain is much larger in proportion to the size of the body, than when the growth is completed ; and in the early months of preg- nancv this difference is still more remarkable. V In proportion as the body more completely evolves itself, the relative size becomes less, the other parts of the body having then a quicker growth than the brain; and it is a very considerable length of time after birth before the brain and the other parts of the body acquire their proper balance. The brain at an early period of existence is also a good deal different in its structure from what it is afterwards. It is much softer; and in proportion as the child advances in growth it is found to be more and more firm. The difference between the appearance of the cor- tical and medullary substance, is at a very early period of life less strongly marked than it afterwards becomes. The power, too, of the brain to sustain pressure, is at this very

120 medullary matter, as the optic nerve ; but in the greater number this matter is so enve- loped in a tough cellular membrane, as to render its appearance less distinct. In the olfactory nerves there is an evident junction of the cortical with the medullary matter, but in some of the others there is clearly no- thing but medullary matter; and it is ex- tremely doubtful whether in the nerves ge- nerally, of the body, there be any mixture at all of the cortical. The nerves appear to consist of little cylin- drical masses of medullary substance inclosed in a tough cellular membrane. In this cel- lular membrane there are distributed a num- ber of small blood-vessels ; but I have never been able to observe any distinct coverings of the dura mater and the pia mater, as many anatomists have supposed. With regard to the minute structure of the ultimate fibrils, I believe that nothing satisfactory is known; and it would exceed the limits of this lecture to enter into an examination of the opinions upon this subject. The nerves are distributed to different parts of the body in very different proportions.

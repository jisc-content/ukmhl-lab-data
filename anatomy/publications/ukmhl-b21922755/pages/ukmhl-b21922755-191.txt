181 symptoms were repeatedly removed by the same means in the same patient. Where the difficulty of breathing has been very great, and the legs and thighs have been much swelled from anasarca, I have known much relief afforded by a scarificator and small cupping-glass being applied above the inner and outer ankle of each leg; and I do not remember any mortification at- tacking these small sores. The difficulty of breathing in such cases probably depended in part upon the water accumulated in the cellular membrane of some parts within the chest, and this was gradually emptied through the small openings made in the skin of the legs.

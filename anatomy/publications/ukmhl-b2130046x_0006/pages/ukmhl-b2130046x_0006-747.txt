UTERUS—(Development). 655 Uterine cavity, but the lower forms an attached base of greater or less breadth, which is conti- nuous in its entire circumference with the parietal decidua. The two chambers are totally distinct, and have no communication ■with each other. In aborted specimens, an aperture may be sometimes seen in the base or outer surface of the fcetal chamber, or that part which has been torn away from the ute- rine substance. In a very early specimen in my possession, and also in another which I have examined, one or more points are dis- tinguishable also upon the upper or northern pole of the little spherical chamber, which have the appearance of apertures recently closed. Coste, in his beautiful series of illus- trations*, directs attention, in several figures, to a similar spot in the same situation, having the a|)pearance of a recently closed aperture, or umbilicus. These traces of openings in both the upper and lower poles of the s|)here, are of consequence, in reference to the expla- nation which will be presently offered of the mode of formation of the decidua reflexa and fcetal chamber. The outer surface of this chamber is nearly Fig. 453.

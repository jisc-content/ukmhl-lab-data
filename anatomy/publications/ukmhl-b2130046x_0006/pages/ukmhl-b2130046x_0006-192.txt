Their data, therefore, are all taken from the secretion as they found it in the horse. Tiedemaim and Ginelinlj: obtained the pan- creatic fluid from the dog, the sheep, and the horse — that is, from one carnivorous and two herbivorous animals ; and their results present the most striking discrepancies with those of the contemporaneous experiments of Lenret and Lassaigne. In the dog this fluid, which was obtained abundantly, was limpid, with a faint blueish, opalescent cast, and a mucilaginous feeling like the white of egg diluted with water, a slight but sensibly saline taste, the first por- tion faintly acid, the portion last secreted slightly alkaline, and so abundantly albumi- nous as to be rendered semi-solid by heat nitric acid, &c.

The secretion in the horse resem- bled in all its reactions that of the sheep, except that the albumen was not so abundant. The sunnriary conclusions at which these authors arrive, are that the pancreatic fluid contains — 1. In solids, in the dog 8-72, in the sheep 5 per cent. 2. The solids consist of — a. A large amount of albumen, about half of the dry residuum. b. Osmazome. c. A substance reddened by chlorine, found only in the dog. d. A caseous substance, probably allied to salivary matter. e. A small amount of free acid, probably acetic, present in all these specimens. It is worthy of remark, that that por- tion of the pancreatic fluid which was secreted last was slightly alkaline : this change probably depended on the enfeeblement of the nervous influence resulting from the operation. f. The ash consisted of alkaline carbo- nate, chloride, phosphate, and sulphate, and carbonate and phosphate of lime. g. The alkaline sulpho-cyanide is not met with in the pancreatic secretion. h. Tiie alkali consists of a large qiiantUi/ of -potash, and a very sraall portion of soda salts. If we compare the composinon of the pan- creatic secretion in the dog and the sheep with that of the saliva, we find the following difllerences;— 1. The solid residue of the saliva does not equal half that of the pancreas. 2. The saliva contains mucus and a peculiar animal (salivary) matter. If it contains al- bunnnous or caseous matter, these subtances are, in every case, in very small quantit}'. On the contrary, the pancreatic fluiil contains an abundance of albumen and caseous matter, but not a trace of mucus, and true salivary matter, if it exists, is in very small quantity. 3. The saliva is neutral, or contains a little alkaline carbonate. The pancreatic secretion contains a little free acid. 4. The saliva contains sulpho-cyanide of potassium; in the pancreatic fluid there is none. 3. The other salts are nearly the same. C. It results, therefore, that those physio- logists who think the pancreatic secretion identical with saliva are in error. There is, then, an entire discrepancy be- tween these two authorities with regard to the pancreatic secretion—its physical quali- ties, reaction, amount of solids, chemical con- stitution, the conclusions they infer, &c.

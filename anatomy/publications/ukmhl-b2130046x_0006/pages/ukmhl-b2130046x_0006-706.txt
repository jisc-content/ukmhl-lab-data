In older female embryos the Fallopian tubes, now more completely formed, are thicker and exhibit a somewhat imdiilating outline. The Fig. 417. Internal generative organs of a fcetal deer.

Wolffian bodies, much reduced in size, may be found lying in a duplicature of peritoneum, between the ovaries and the oviducts. The inferior portion of the latter becomes wi- dened, and the division between the tubes and the horns, or cornua, of the uterus is established ; although the tube still remains relatively very broad, even up to its abdomi- nal end. In the human subject the opportunities for observation upon very early embryos being of not very frequent occurrence, the foregoing changes have not been so accurately traced in the first stages as in the embryos of birds and mammals ; but all the examina- tions which have yet been made lead to the conclusion that the Fallopian tube has {After J. origin in a duct similar to that already described. This, with the rest of the in- ternal organs, is sufficiently developed by the third month of utero-gestation to leave no longer any doubt as to the sex. By this period the oviducts have nearly acquired that horizontal position which, from the fourth month onwards, becomes a more marked cha- racteristic. In embryos of the fourth month the tubes run parallel with the now horizon- tally placed ovaries, whose elongated form corresponds vs-ith the tube in the greater por- tion of its length. By the end of this month the abdominal end of the tube is seen to be wide open, and traces of the fimbriEe are dis- coverable in its already fringed margin. The lower ends of the tubes are still not so com- pletely united but that an indentation is per- ceptible at their point of junction, giving evidence of the still bi-corned condition of the uterus. From this period onwards the proper structure of the tube wall appears to grow with greater rapidity than the fold of peritoneum by which it is invested ; so that in advanced embryos, and in the foetus at term, the ovi- duct is usually found of a tortuous or serpentine form, its windings being easily dis- tinguishable through the peritoneal sheath. The tube now much exceeds the ovary in length, and its infundibulur end is beautifully margined with delicate fimbriae (/%. 418.).

In the Badger the ilia and ischia are large, expanded, and curved outwards at their free extremities. The iliac shaft is prismatic, with an ilio-lumhar angle of 140째. The pubcs are rather long, with an elongated symph^ sis, and form an angle with the ilia of about 130째. Tlie same general conformation is evident in tlie Racoons and Coatis, tlie ilio-ischial angle being, however, somewhat better marked, anil the ilio- pubic about 145째. The Coatis have but one sacral vertebra. In the Ilytena, also, the iliac wings are considerably spread, with a very pointed anterior spine. In the Dingo the isckio-puhic element is very short, the anterior outlet and obturator foramina small, but the posterior outlet larger. The Weasel has a very small pelvis, with but two sacral vertebrae, one only ai ticulating with upper extremities of the long iliac shafts. In the Phoca: the sacriun has four vertebrce, the first only articulating with ilia, and much wider in its transverse processes than the rest ; the ilia arc extremely short, thick, and curved outwards, with very small external fossa?; the ischia are long and slender, with small tuberosi- ties almost touching the second coccygeal ver- tebra, with long rami not forming a symphysis, but directed backward to meet the pubis. The jmhes are very long, slender, and oblique, with a siiort symphysis, and including a very large, oval obturator foramen. The pelvis altogether somewhat resembles that of the Badger, with the superior opening much elongated antero- posteriorly, and triangular in shape, with the base at the sacrum. The shortness of the ilia alone indicates the great contraction of the posterior extremities for their swimming re- quirements. Dr. Knox has observed, in a pregnant female Seal, a separation of the symphysis pubis, and elongation of its liga- ments to the extent of nearly 2 inches, such as Le Gallois has described in the Guinea-pig. He found, moreover, that such a separation of the bones produced much more enlarge- ment of diameters in these elongated trian- gular pelves than in the transverse oval form of the human female. In the order of pelvic development, the Paclnjdermata occupy a very high place, being characterised by great massiveness, propor- tionate shallowness, and perpendicularity of pelvis, and large and overhanging acetabula, the better to support the immense weight of these animals, thrown more on the liinder ex- tremities than in the Carnivora, from their bulky dorsal structures and abdominal vis- cera. The ischial spinous ridges and anterior inferior iliac spines are faintly marked or wanting, the sacral spines are coalesced into a continuous crest, and there is little or no sacral promontory. The sacrum of the Elephant (7%. 95.) is comparatively very narrow, flat, and short, and placed on the spine at an angle almost imperceptible; the number of vertebrae being four only, according to Cuvier. The coccygeal vertebree are numerous. The ilia are short, broad, massy, fan- shaped, and much expanded, with a large concavity or iliac fossa directed forwards and downwards, the dorsum being alter- nately concave and convex. The iliac crest (c) is large and flat-arched, with the anterior su- perior spine (rt) hooked suddenly downwards, and the posterior inferior directed backward from the sacro-iliac joint, to alFortl leverage to the powerful sacro-iliac ligament. There are no well-marked iliac ribs, except the cotylo- sacral (rf), which is very strong and massy. The ischia are moderately short, and form an ilio-ischial angle about 145째, presenting no spine, and having the tuberosities (c) directed Fig. 95: Pelvis of the Elephant, front view. dorsally, and the rami (/) vertically towards the abdominal surfoce. The puhcs are short, and directed almost horizontally inwards, with a well-marked ilio-pectineal spine (/;). The symphysis (g) is parallel to the vertebra', and very long, including the whole of the short ischial rami as far as the rough por- tion forming the tuberosity, so that the ischio-pubic symphysis extends as far back- wards as the tuberosities. The sciatic notches are wide and open, but the obturator foramina are smaller than the cotyloid fossae, which are very large and overhang much at the superior or ilorsal part.

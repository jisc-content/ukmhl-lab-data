Vertebra; are unequal quantities, iv, 624. II. even the one vertebra is not of equal quan- tity in all individuals of the same species, iv. 625. III. all vertebriE contain a greater or less an-iount of known elemental pieces, iv. 625. IV. the dorsal vertebra of human anatomy is an artificial figure, iv, 625. V. the cervical vertebra rievelopcs the costal ajipendages also, iv. 626. VI. all the cervical vertebrce develope costal appendages, iv. 627, Vll. the lumbar vertebra developes the- costal appendage, iv. 627. VIII. all the lumbar vertebree develope costal appendages, iv, 628, IX. the sacral vertebias develope costal apjien- dages, iv, 628, X. the coccygeal vertebrie are deprived of their costal appendages, iv. 629. XI. the first seven thoracic costo-vertebral figures are whole or plus quantiiies, iv. 629. XII. the five asternal cn?to-vertebral forms are proportionals nietamorphosetl from five sternal costo-vertcbral plus quantities, iv. 630. XIII. the five lumbar vertebrje are proportionals metamorphosed from five sternal costo- vertebral archetypes, iv. 630 XIV. the sacro-coccygcal series of vertcbrjB are proport.on.als degraded from sternal costo-vcrtebral circles, iv. 631. XV. the seven ceivical vertebras are propor- tionals degraded from seven slerno-costo- vertebral uhcle quantities, iv, 631, XVI. the mammalian spinal axis consists of a series of segmental quantities, whose only variety or specific 'distinction depends upon proportioning from whole thoracic quantities, iv, 631, XVII. unilormity of structure is a condition proper to the jilus thoracic originals of the spinal axis of the mammalian body, iv. 632. XVIII. every spinal Fegment which is lesser refers to every spinal segment v/liicli is greater ; and all lesser segme^nts refer to that which is greatest, iv. 633. XIX, .structural uniformity cannot characterise such spinal segments as are proportionally or quantitatively various, iv. 6.^3. XX. specific variety is none oilier than propor- tional variety, iv. 633, XXI. the knowledge of the difi^rential quantity between all spin.il segments, renders them exactly uniform in idea, iv, 633, XXII. witiiout knowing the full dimensions of whole or uniform quantities, we can never rightly understand the real charac. ter of lesser and special forms, and there- fore can never otherwise understand the law of formation, iv, 634, XX III. the mammalian cervix is not limited to the fixed number of seven cervical vertebrie, iv. 634, XXIV. the number of cervical vertebra; in the mammal cervix depends upon the num- ber of archetypal costo-vertebral figures which have sufr'ered metamorphosis, iv, 635. XXV. the presence of cervical ribs subtracts from the number of ce: vical vertebra;, and ad(Js to the number of thoracic archetypes, iv. 636. XXVI. the length of the thorax depends upon the number of persistent costo-vertebral ar- chetypes, iv, 636, XXVII, the numerical length of the lumbar spinal region dejiends upon the number of ar- chetypes subjected to metamorphosis, iv. 637, XXVIII, the numerical length of the sacral and coccygeal scries is not fixed, and this is owing to the same fact of archetypes un- dergoing metamorphosis, iv. 637, XXIX. a comparison of the same numerical verte- bra in all human spinal axes will prove the truth of tlie present interpretation of the law which governs the developmeiit of all vertebral forms, not only in the same spine, but all other .'■pines, iv. 637. XXX. the anomaly is a link in the chain of Ibrm, iv. 638. XXXI. all the spinal segments of all classes and species of vertebrated animals are only as

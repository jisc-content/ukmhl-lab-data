It appears, liowever, to con- sist of a very small quantity of indistinctly fibrous tissue; which encloses some capillaries. and is covered by the ordinary layer of co- lumnar epithelium. The frequent rupture of the follicle in this situation lias led many to regard it as either possessing a permanent orifice here, or ac- quiring one by a kind of natural deliiscence. But later researches seem to show that this open state is quite exceptional and accidental; being due to disease, putrefaction, or mechanical violence. The author can at least express his own conviction that—as Boehm long ago stated, — the agminate follicles are closed sacs. This conclusion is much confirmed by the fact, that the follicles of some animals are altogether beneath the mucous membrane and the tubes, and quite distinct from both of them ; so as to lie wholly in the sub-mucous areolar tissue.* While the vascular arrange- ments which we are about to describe seem equally incompatible with any theory of their normal dehiscence. Each of these follicles essentially consists of a capsule, enclosing a number of delicate capillaries, the interstices of which are occu- pied by a cell-growth consisting of various forms. The capsule is a structure which, though analogous to a basement membrane, differs from such a delicate homogeneous lamina, both in being much thicker, and in offering an in- distinctly fibrous texture. Its smooth outer surface contains elastic fibres, and is attached by loose areolar tissue to the surrounding sub-mucous structures. The vessels of the follicle offer a very peculiar arrangement. The small arteries in the sub-mucous areolar tissue give off" branches that ramify amongst the several follicles of each " patch ;" and thus form a network of Fig. 271.

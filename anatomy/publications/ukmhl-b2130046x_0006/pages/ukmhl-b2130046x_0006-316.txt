The white substance which occupies the original cavities of the tuber, is formed of closed tubes, which are given off in great numbers from the surfaces of the laniintE. These tubes, which are the terminations of the filaments of which the laminie are com- posed, are of two kinds. Some are of equal diameter throughout, and divided at intervals by septa; others, much shorter, are dilated at their extremities, and contain spores (thecae). Each theca is an obovate vesicle, and con- tains two, three, or more spores, never more than eight. Each spore is invested with a beau- tifully reticulate, or sometimes warty epispore, within which may be distinguished a smooth inner membrane, immediately enclosing the oleaginous contents.f * Vittadini, Monog.

Theascophorous Fungi are represented in their simplest form by the Uredinete, a family which has been studied by numerous observers on account of the destructive pro- perties of the plants belonging to it. The mass which is formed by the growth of the reproductive organs of Uredo under the epi- dermis of the leaves of the [)lants upon which it grows parasitically, may be aptly compared to a pustule, a grumous-looking substance, occupying, as it were, the place of the pus. On more minute examination of the cavity, we find tliat it is bounded by a kind of irre- gular wall or lining of pyriform cells, the smaller ends of which rest upon a reticular cushion of mycelium. These are probably the enlarged extremities of the mycelium filaments, with which many of them can be distinctly traced to be connected. Towards the base of the cavity other cells are developed, resem- bling those first mentioned in their general form, as well as in their relation to the myce- lium. In these, however, the membrane is produced inferiorly, so as to form a tubular pedicle; while in the club-shaped upper ex- tremity it is lined by a considerable deposit of granular protoplasma, so that here the central cavity is very much smaller than that of the external membrane. It is in this cavity that the spore is formed, at first not exceeding it in size, but afterwards increasing at the ex- pense of the protoplasma, so as almost to fill the theca. In other genera, as in Phragmidiura, there are pedicled cells of a similar form, and originating in a similar manner, which, how- ever, instead of one spore, develop a number in their interior; these spores are arranged in linear series, and are formed in the same manner. The protoplasma, however, never disappears completely, but remains as a more or less consistent membrane, glueing the ripe spore to the spore-case which encloses it. Some of the UredineiE possess a cyst which re- minds us of the perithecium of the Sphceriaceae, to which they are evidently closely related. The cyst is formed (CEcidium) of a single layer of roundish cells.* 38. From the Uredineae we pass by a natural transition to the Discomycetes and Pyreno- mycetes. These plants have been investi- gated with much success by MM. Tulasne, who have shown that they possess the closest relationship not only to the Lichens, but to the most simple thread Fungi. The very remarkable facts which these observers have discovered, render the study of these plants more satisfactory and instructive than that of any other family of the class. The Pyrenomycetes are represented by Sphosria, the receptacle of which consists, as is well known, of a spherical cyst, which is open above. Its wall is frequently prolonged up- wards into a tubular beak, which projects beyond the surflice of the bark or wood in which the whole plant is embedded. The membrane of the cyst (perithecium) is usually * L. R. Tulasne, Recherches sur les Uredin&s &c. Ann. des Sc. Nat. 3me. S. t. vii. p. 12.

An inspection of the foregoing table will at once show this in the pelvic diameters. It will be seen that the antero-posterior dia- meters in the Chimpanzee, Uran-utan, and Gibbon prevail greatly over the transverse; that the depth both of the whole and the true pelvis is nnich greater than in the human pelvis ; and that the sacrum is much narrower, espe- cially in the Chimpanzee, and the ischial spines more closely approximated. The. sacro-ver- tehral angle, too, is remarkably increased, es- pecially in the Chimpanzee (1G0°), the sacrum being placed much more nearly in the direc- tion of the whole spinal cohunn, and having a less vertical, as well as a much less horizontal curvature, with no sacral promontory in the Chimpanzee, and little in the Uran ; while the coccyx is straighter, and placed more in the line of the spinal column, and its tip is ele- vated above the level of the upper border of the symphysis pubis, so that the whole of the sacrum and coccyx is seen in front view. {See fiS- 92-) ... This high position of the coccyx is owing partly to the shortness of the sacrum, which is composed of three large fiat vertebrae, all entering'] into the formation of the sacro-iliac joint, and united by ankylosis to two of the four coccygeal pieces in the Uran, and to one only in the Gibbons. In the Chimpanzee, however, there are four sacral vertebrae, all articulating laterally with the ilia, and the anterior sacral foramina are very small. The cocri/.v is composed of five vertebra;. The ilia are much longer, thicker, more massive, and narrower, and present no central transparent portion nor internal fossa, being flat anteriorly antl concave posteriorly, there- verse of the human ilia, and looking almost directly backwards and forwards, and very little inwards and upwards ; so that, in these animals, there cannot be said to be any false pelvic cavity. In the Uran of the Hunterian IVIu- seum they are two thirds of the femurs in length, and measure 6 inches, and in the Chimpanzee 7 inches, reaching as high as the third lumbar vertebra.

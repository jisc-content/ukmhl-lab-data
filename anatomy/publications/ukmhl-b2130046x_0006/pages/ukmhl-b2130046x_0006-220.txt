PELVIS. 130 raarkable, as constituting the different pelvic properties of certain classes of animals. It will also be observed that the transverse diameter of the brim is the greatest in the dry bones, but this is so diniinisiied by the presence of the iliac and psoas muscles and fascia, that, in the living female subject, the oblique is generally the best adapted to receive the long diameter of the foetal skull. The soft structures diminish the antero- posterior diameters of the brim by about a quarter of an inch, and the transverse, by half an inch; the diameters of the cavitT/heing lessened about a quarter of an inch ; a fact which it is necessary to bear in mind in estimating the width in the living subject. The measure- ments in the third double column were taken from fourteen male and eighteen female sub- jects in the dissecting room of King's College, London, and are compared in the first column with the contrasted measure- ments of the male and female pelvis given by Meckel, and quoted by most English writers on the subject; and in the second column with those given by John James Watt, in his work on the pelvis.

The circumferential measurement of the briiii in well-formed males gave in my own mea- surements 2 inches to each of the ilia, 3 inches to each of the pubes, and 4i to the sacrum, which, allowin;; J inch to each of the sacro- iliac cartilages and \ inch to the pubic, gives ii total circumference of 15^ ineiies. In the well-made female the ilia were found to be each 2i, the pubes each 3^, and the sacrum 5 inches, giving, with the same allowance for tlie sacro'-iliac cartilages and J- inch for the pubic, a total of 17^ inches. Thus the suiierior size of the brim in the female seems to depend more upon the ilia than upon the pubes, although the direct distance betvyeen the ilio-pectineal eminence and the sacro-iliac joint differs little in the sexes, because of the greater curve made by the female ilia. The circumferential extent of the borders, at the plane of the inferior outlet in a female pelvis of average diameters, and dried with the sacro- sciatic ligaments attached, was 14-inches. In the fresh state it generally amounts to 15, as the ligaments shrink by drying, and would be extended to 16 inches, or more, by the ex- tension of the coccyx and the elasticity of the ligamentous portions.* * The circumferential measurement appears to be one not generally estimated as much as its utility in detecting variations of size depending upon shape would seem to call for, in the female pelvis.

UTERUS — (Normal Anatomy). 627 the substance of the organ. No just concep- observed to diverge slightly, so as to leave a tion, however, of the real form or capacity of spindle-shaped canal traversing the whole this interspace can be obtained by examniing it vrith the aid of sections made in one direc- tion only- In order to obtain a correct notion of the form and extent of this cavity, it is desirable first to make a longitudinal section through the centre of the entire organ parallel with its lateral borders. The cavity or interspace is then indicated by a line rimning from below upwards, and terminating within half an inch of the fundus {fig. 426.). The upper half of this line indicates the cavity of the tderus; the lower half, that of the cervix. The latter alone exhibits a true cavity; for here the parietes of the cervix are F'm. 427. length of the uterine neck {fig. 431. cc). A second view is obtained by cutting com- pletely through the uterus in the direction of its transverse diameter, and parallel with its extremities. If the entire organ be cut up into many such segments {fig. 427—430.), itis then seen, from the length of the central line, that the cavity varies in breadth, its widest part being in the segment which includes the ex- tremities of the Fallopian tubes ; whilst from this point downwards the line diminishes in length, until at the narrowest portion of the uterus, or that representing the commence- ment of the cervix, it measures only — 3'" in diameter. But the most complete vicvsr of the interior of the uterus is obtained by a section carried through the centre of the organ, dividing it midway between its anterior and posterior walls. The entire cavity which is thus ex- hibited at one view is seen to be of a trian- gular form; its boundaries being formed superiorly by the fundus, and on either side by the two lateral borders, whilst in each angle is observed an aperture. The two su- perior openings are the lower orifices of the Fallopian tubes. The inferior opening lead- ing to the cervical canal constitutes the os uteri internum {fig. 431. i).

(^Ad Nat.) Since the cavity in the interior of the uterine body has a triangular form, whilst externally the shape of the organ is more or less pyriform, it is evident that the parietes of this " hollow muscle" cannot have every- where an equal thickness, for otherwise the form of the cavity would correspond with

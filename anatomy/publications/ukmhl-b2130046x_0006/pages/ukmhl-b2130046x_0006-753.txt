UTERUS — (Development). 661 u L 3 form. He rather conceives that a reduction in old age. — Whether the uterus has been so takes place, that either the contents of the employed, in its ultimate office, in the pro- nerve fibre are partly or entirely removed by cess of reproduction, viz. that of gestation, or resorption, so that there remains, according whether it has proceeded only so far towards to circumstances, a partly or entirely empty this as to have been limited to the repetition, sheath ; or that the contents of the fibre are in unvarying succession, of that preparatory transformed in the same manner that Giinther stage which is expressed by the minor func- and Schdn (Henle, Allgemeine Anat. p. 771.) observed in divided nerves; viz. that the contents of the tubules become coagulated, as after death, and are then subject to resorption: the fibre appearing then to be perishing, and ribbon-like, and the contents to be disappear- ing. Regarding the human uterus, he thinks it in the highest degree probable, that the nerve fibre is included in the energetic resorp- tion process that affects the puerperal uterus generally ; that a reduction of the fibre fol- lows ; and that, in the next pregnancy, it again becomes developed pari passu with the development of the other tissues. tion of menstruation, in either case the period equally arrives at which the activity of the organ passes away. Ova are no longer dis- charged from the ovaries. These cease to be creative or developing organs ; and with this cessation of the proper function of the ovary, there comes also a corresponding diminution, and finally a termination of the correlative offices of the uterus. It is now interesting to observe how the uterus gratlually resumes some of the pecu- liar features which it exhibited at an earlier period of life. It may be said to fall back again into its infantine condition. For with f. The uterus after the menstrtial epoch, and the shrivelling of the ovaries, and their reduc- Fis. 45G.

This part be- comes atrophied more than the rest ; its walls become thinner, partly from diminished circulation in them, and partly from atrophy of the component tissues, which appear pale and nearly bloodless. Thus it happens that, in advanced life, the walls of the uterine body, no longer possessing that fulness which at an earlier period caused them to encroach upon thecavity, and toexhibitthat incurvation of the sides and fundus which has been described as characteristic of the mature organ, again re- turn to the straight and more attenuated con- dition which they had in early life. We may often observe, therefore, in the uterus of aged persons, a nearer approach to the form of the equilateral triangle, caused by the short- ening of the body and the straightening of its walls, than is seen in the uterine cavity of mid- life ; and it is this return to the form of the foetal cavity, together with the now prepon- derating size of the cervix, which remains Fig. 4.37.

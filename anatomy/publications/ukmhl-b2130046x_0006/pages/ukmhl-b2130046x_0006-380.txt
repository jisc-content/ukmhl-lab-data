288 RESPIRATION. of the body receives blood directlij from the cardiac ventricle. The carotids, the homo- logues of the subclavian, the hyo-opercular and orbito-nasal arteries proceed from the abdominal aorta at the point of confluence of the branchial veins. In these vessels, there- fore, the blood is arterialised, while its move- ment is im|)ulsatile or venous. The pro- pulsive agents, under the form of diminutive lymphatic hearts, which Dr. M. Hall*, M, Fohmanf, and J. MiillerJ have shown to guard the several points of communication between the absorbent and venous systems, probably renders as great assistance in cir- culating the contents of the latter as those of the former orders of vessels. In the white- bait {Clupea alba of Yarrell) these micro- scopic hearts can be most perfectly observed. From a consideration of the preceding traits distinctive of the circulation of fishes, it will be afterwards shown that the laws of aquatic respiration are destined to receive new eluci- dation. Minute Circidalion of the Branch'uE. â€” Tiie branchial arteries proceed on either side, symmetricaly, from the aorta, and travel through a groove along the convex border of the branchial arches, the veins lying to the outside of the artery, that is, next to the [lec- tinated fringes of the gills. The cartilage system of the arches and that of the penknite- shai)ed processes (bearing the ultimate bron- chial leaflets) are quite distinct and uncon- nected save by fibrous structure. It is in the in- tervals between tiiese solid parts that the trunks of the vessels are disposed. As the pectinated processes {a, Jig. 235.) arise, when biserial, alternately from the arch, the arterial branches leading to them observe a similar arrange- ment. The arteries carrying venous blood invariably run along the thick border or outer margin of each process, the vein occupying the innermost edge. A branchial process, attached at right angles to the convex border of the arch, resembles a penknife, the back of which corresponds with the thick and outermost borders, and the edge of the blade with the thin or acute siile of the process. A string carried from base to point would mark the position of the branchial artery convey- ing venous blood : brought back along the acute edge, it would denote the line of the branchial vein bearing arterial blood. In the marsnpio-branchii (as the myxine, lam- prey, &c.), in which the gills are fixeil and inoperculate, this is also the virtual arrange- ment of the secondary trunks. In the lopho- branchii (sea-horse, pipe-fish, &c.), in which the branchiae are tufted, the disposition of the minute vessels is not dissimilar. The JIat surfaces of the penknife-shaped process are gorgeously festooned by foliaceous multi- plications of the membrane (Jig. 235, i). In the annexed illustration, 07ie of these leaflets has been shown.

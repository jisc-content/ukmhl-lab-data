453 SYMPATHETIC NERVE. G G 3 g-^'o^th of an inch in diameter, and presenting a slightly granular surface (most of tlieui are round ; others have more or less an oval shape); 2nd, distinct cells measuring from the ioVutli to the t^W*'^ of meter : they contain a finely molecular fluid, and also a nucleus. The latter, which is fre- quently situated towards one side of the cell, is round and granular, and generally contains a nucleolus. With the exception of their smaller size, they resemble ordinary ganglionic cor- puscles. The nerves in the ganglion present the aspect of flattened bantls of blastema, consisting almost entirely of corpuscles re- sembling those first described, arranged close together in linear series in a somewhat gra- nular matrix. They vary in breadth consi- derably. The ganglia on the posterior roots of the spinal nerves present the same struc- ture. The sympathetic ganglia appear to be en- tirely composed of sti'uctures similar to those first described, imbedded in a more or less granular transparent blastema. In embryos of 6 to 8 inches in length, the sympathetic ganglia still contain a large num- Fig. 299.

There are also present a number of bodies larger than these, and consisting of a distinct cell-wall inclosing, besides a nucleus, a finely-granular fluid. They are connnonly ronntl ; some are more or less e;;g-shapeti. The nucleus in the latter is generally situated towarils the wider extremity of the eel', while its narrow end is prolonged into a delicate, granular process about the -joVoth o'' inch in breadth. The nerves in the gan- glia do not difliir much in appearance from those in the Gasserian ganglion of the embryo of \}i inches in length. The sympathetic cord and branches present the same structure. In the ganglia of the cerebro-spinal nerves, the ganglionic corpuscles are larger and moi'e dis- tinctly formed than in the sympathetic ganglia. Many of the cells have processes similar to those above described; and in several of these, at a short distance from the corpuscle, there is a small oval nucleus such as Kolliker describes in the hmnan embryo of 16 inches. The nerves belonging to the cerebro-spinal system are also much further developed than those in the sympathetic. Those in the bra- chial plexus present the appearance of being composed of a slightly-granular transparent blastema, marked by longitudinal strias, and containing embedded in it oval gi-anular nuclei. The stricE are arranged parallel to one ano- ther, and evitiently correspond to the margins of the nerve-fibres. The nuclei are arranged at intervals, and occupy the entire breadth of the fibres. There is no trace of the white substance of Schwann. Fig. 300.

In the sympathetic ganglia of embryos measuring 18 or 19 inches in length, there are still present a considerable number of granular corpuscles measuring from the 4â€žVot'^ the ^^--t\\ of an inch in diameter, similar to those already described. They are chiefly com- ])osed, however, of cells resembling those in the ganglia after birth, only smaller and more delicate. The nerve-filn-es in the ganglia have much the same appearance as those already described in the brachial plexus of embryos from 6 to 8 inches in length. In the ganglia occurring on the posterior roots of the spinal nerves, the (iasserian ganglion, and the gan- glion on the trunk of the pncumo-gastric, the ganglionic corpuscles differ from those in the perlect animal only in point of size. Most of the nerve-fibres connected with the ganglia present the same tubular character as the perfect nerve-fibre. The nerve-fibres in the roots of all the cranial nerves present the dis=

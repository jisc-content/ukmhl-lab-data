And in the London Medical and Physical Journal (Aug. 1815) the particulars of a case are given in which the right ovary weighed nearly 52 lbs. But these are moderate examples compared with some of still larger growth. Camper* relates a case in which about 80 lbs. of serum were contained in the left ovary ; and Douglas also one in which the left ovary held 70 lbs., besides a considerable collection of fluid in the pleura and pericardium, f These enormous collections of fluid are ge- nerally limited to the ovary of one side, though both organs may be coincidently affected, as in the example given by W. E, L. MLiller J, who found in the body of a woman, ageil 36, in the two ovaries together 140 lbs. of fluid. In what proportion either or both of the ova- ries are affected by ovarian dropsy may be seen by reference to the tables of Saffbrd Lee and Chereau. The former shows the right ovary affected 50 times, the left 35, and both together 8 times. The latter gives 10!> ex- amples of the right, 78 of the left, and 28 of both sides. Notwithstanding the large amount of fluid which may collect within the distended ovary as shown in the foregoing examples, these yet serve to give but a feeble notion of the enor- mous quantities which may be effused from the walls of an ovarian cyst in the course of a lifetime, or even of a few years, when the contents are removed from time to time, and are allowed to re-accumulate. Pagenstecher^J removed, in 35 operations, 1132 lbs. of fluid, without reckoning what escaped by allowing the canula to remain. Dr. Mead's patient was tapped G7 limes in five and a half years, and lost 1920 pints. Ford || punctiu-ed the ovary 49 times, and removed in all 278G pints ORMAL Anatomy). 583 of fluid. Heidrich* in eight years punctured 299 times, and removed 3289 Berlin quarts (Berl. Maass), equal to 9867 ined. pounds, the death of the woman occurring at the age of 43. And in the celebrated case of Mr. Martineau, of Norwich, in the course of twenty-five years the patient lost by tapping, in 80 operations, 6031 pints, equal to 1.3 hogsheads of fluid. Composition of the Fluids contained in Ovarian Cijsts.—Although these fluids usually coagu- late freely in a greater or less degree on the addition of heat or nitric acid, the proportion of free albumen which they contain is usually considerably less than is found in the serum of blood; they contain, however, a larger quantity in combination with soda than is found in that fluid. According to the analysis of Dr. Owen Rees, who has examined several specimens of ovarian fluids, their chief characteristics are, a considerable excess of water and of extrac- tives, and a deficiency of albumen as compared with the serum of blood. To the presence of a large quantity of extractives, particularly the albumen combined with soda, Dr. Rees attri- butes that peculiar tenacious mucoid character which these fluids so commonly possess. This is always in relation to the nature of the solid ingretlients, and is quite independent of any peculiar proportions of water, to which at first it might be su[)posed to be due. Again, the alkaline salts obtained from ovarian fluids dif- fer from those of blood in not containing any phosphate which can be recognised even as a trace, unless experiments be made upon large quantities for the express purpose of detect- ing that substance. The foliov/ing table by Dr. O. Rees, gives the results of the analysis of four fluids drawn from seGonda?y cysts of an ovarian tumour, compared with an analysis of the serum of blood. No. \. No. 2.

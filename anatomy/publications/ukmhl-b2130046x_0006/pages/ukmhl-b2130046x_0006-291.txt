A remarkable peculiarity of this deformity is, that, with the exception of the difference in the side where the ank3 losis had taken place, the pelves affected with it were extremely like each other. The strength, texture, and ap- pearance of the bones were perfectly healthy ; there was no limping gait observed in the patients affected with it; nor any history of accident, rickets, or malacosteon. Examples. — Naegele collected, with incre- dible industry, notes of thirty-five examples of this disease in female pelves, and two in male pelves. Of these, two (one male and the other female) were in the collection of Pro- fessor Montgomery, of Dublin, and the others in the various collections of France, Germany, and Italy. In one case, which was observed during life by the author himself, he observed a slight halt in the gait of the patient, who otherwise was ap[)arently well-built, healthy, and active. In her first labour, at the age of eighteen years, the fuetal head in the early stage was found placed vei'y high, and easily moveable, and the sacral promontory could not be reached by the finger. The patient was delivered, on the third day, with extreme difficulty by the aid of the forceps, and died fifteen days afterwards from puer()eral fever. The pelvis was found affected with the oblique deibrmity, but in strength, weight, and texture perfectly healthy (fg. 123.}. The sacrum was Fig. 123. Pelvis olliqiie ovata. {After Naegele ) composed of four pieces only, and measured in length 2 inches 11 lines. The coccyx had six pieces, and measured 1 inch 10 lines. The left sacro-iliac joint was ankylosed, and the same side of the sacrum was shrunk and con- tracted, so as to measure from the sacral pro- montory to the usual position of the sacro- iliac joint, only 1 inch 4 lines ; whereas the same measurement on the right side amounted to 2 inches 2 lines. Th.e length of the left iliac crest was 3 lines less than tinit of the right. From the sacral promontory to the left superior anterior iliac spine measured only 3 inches 11-^ lines. The same measure- ment on the right ^ide amounted to 3 inches 4 lines. At the hrhn of the pelvis the mea- surements were: — in. lines.

In the same pelvis, the right sacro-cot3'loid measured only 1 inch 8 lines ; raul the left 3 inches 1 line. In one case, the left, and, in another, the right sacro-cot3'loid diameter, was as low as 1 inch 6 lines. In one instance, the distance between the ti|) of the coccyx and the tuber ischii of the ank3!oid side, was only 1 inch. The left sitle was the one most frequently affected b\' the ank3 losis, but the right side was also found affected in many of the specimens, and, among others, in the pelvis of an Egyptian female mummy. In addition to the foregoing, three female pelves are described by the same autlioi-, in which the oblique deformity was present, but the diminution of the diameters not so great as to produce any great obstacle to parturition. One of these is in the Museum of St. Bar- tholomew's Hospital, and is rather above the medium size. The right side of thesacrum is imperfectly developed. The left oblique dia- meter is nearly 11 lines less than the right ; and tlie right sacro-cotyloid tlistance, lOilines less than the left. A line drawn directly for- ward from the sacral promontory cuts the right pubis 1 inch external to the centre of the.sym- physis ; and the distance from the sacral pro- montory to the symphysis is 4 inches 10^ lines. One of them, in Naegele'sown collection has six instead of five sacral pieces. Li none of these three pelves, however, is there ankylosis of either of the sacro-iliac joints, although the imperfect develojiment of one side of the sacrum is evident. In a male pelvis, on the contrary, there was

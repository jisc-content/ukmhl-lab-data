IV. Connexion between vitality and organisation, iii. 148. probability that the properties which give rise to vital action exist in all forms of matter, or at lea't in all of those forms of it cap.ible of be- coming organised, iii. 148. total change effected in the properties of ceitain forms of matter by their entrance into new combinations due to the act of combination, as analogous to vital properties being due to the act of organisation, iii. 149. no property distinct from the matter which ex- hibits it, or capable ot being superadded to it or abstracted from it, analogy of the magnetic properties of iron to vitality considered, iii. 149. evidence of vitality being due to the properties of matter in the condition of organised tissues, to be found in the vital actions themselves, iii. 149. the assertion that the existence of organisation implies a previous existence of life, considered, iii. 150. many actions performed by living beings common to them and inorganic matter, iii. 1.50. preparation of materials for organization, iii. 150.

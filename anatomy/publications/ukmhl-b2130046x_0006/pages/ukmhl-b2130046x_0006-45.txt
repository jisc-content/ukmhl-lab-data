The subsequent change of each of these polypoids is remarkable. It has been described by Sars and Dalyell as follows : â€” The body undergoing some elongation be- comes partially divided by transverse grooves, into a range or column of imperfect Meduste, attached still to each other l)y their adjacent surfaces, but presenting at their borders, in various degrees of advancement, the division into rays or lobes which belong to the Me- dusa; the upper or terminal one having deve- loped upon it a set of radiated processes dis- tinct from the tentacles of the Polype and much longer than those of the rest. These 3'oung Medusas are successively separated from the stock by the deepening of the transverse clefts between them. They then move about as independent animals, anti proceed in their farther growth and development to sexual and other con)pleteness. These bodies, therefore, arc subject to two kinds of multiplication, which are ver}'difierent: i)y simjile gemma- tion a number or a colony of Strobiltc may be produceil, and by transverse fission and deve- lopment a number of Medusas may be thrown off' from each Strobila. A considerable number of the Medusa pro- geny having been separated, the Strobila stock generally returns to its polypoid condition, 17.

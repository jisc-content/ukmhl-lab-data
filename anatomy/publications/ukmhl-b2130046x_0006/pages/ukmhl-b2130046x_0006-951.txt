859 GENERAL INDEX. 3 K 2 Skeleton — conlfnucd. the variable proportionals of sterno- co^to-vertebral archetypes, iv. 638. XXXII. the liyoid apparatus occurs ojiposite to the cervical spinal region, where we know costal quantity to be lost; the hyoid ap- jiaratus refers to the cervical vertebr;r, and consists of their ribs metamorphosed, iv. fi-lO. XXXIII. the ventral apparatus occurs opposite to the lumbar spinal region, where we under- stand that costal quantity is lost; the ventral apparatus refers to the lumbar vertebra;, and consists of their ribs meta- morphosed, iv. 643. XXXIV. clavicles, coracoid bones, and ribs are iden- tical parts of the costo-vertel)ral whole quantities or archetypes, iv. till-. XXXV. marsuj)ial bones, pubic and ischiadic bones and ribs, are identical parts of the costo- vertebral wliole quantities or archetypes, iv. 618. XXXVI. chevron bones and ribs are identical parts of the costo-vertebral whole quantities or archetypes, iv. 6j0. XXXVII. the sternal median line ranges from the maxilla to the pubic bones of the abstract archetypal skeletal fabric, iv. 6.)1. X.XXVIII. every fossil skeletal species of extinct animals, as well as every recent existing species of skeleton, is a form created of the archetypal skeleton, iv. 6^5. XXXIX. the cranio-facia! apparatus consists, like the thoracic apparatus, of variable propor- tionals of the sterno-costo vertebral quan- tities, iv. 655. XL. the scapulary or fore limbs of all the verte- brated animals are homologous to one another; the variety among these or- gans occurs by a metamorphosis or omis- sion of elementary quantity, iv. 661. XLT. the scapulary and pelvic members are ho- mologous, iv. 664. XLIl. the sterno-costo-vertebral quantity is a pro- portional of the dorso-ventral quantity, iv. 667. XLIII. the scapulary and pelvic pairs of limbs are proportional quantities metamorphosed fnun the dorso-ventral archetypes, iv. 669. XLIV. the cranio-facial apparatus of segments are liroportionals ol the dorso-ventral arche- types, iv. 673. XLV. the cranio-facial apparatus is the origin of the dorso-ventral archetypal series, and the caudal apparatus is its termination, iv. 673. XLVI. the uniform archetypal scries undergoes a grariuated metamor]ihosis of its quanti- ties for the production of all varieties of skeletal species, iv. 674.

EXTERNAL ORGANS OF GENERATION. 709 z z 3 becomes covered with hair. Along the line of apposition of the two labia, where the rima is formed, the hair and integument cease, and the nuicoiis membrane conmion to the rest of the generative canal commences. From this point inwards the surface of the labium is smooth, of a reddish or pink colour, and is here fui nisheti with numerous muciparous and sebaceous follicles, which beilevv the parts with an odorous secretion, and preserve their constant moisture. Tiie labia are united above by a slight frenulum, termed the ante- }-io?- com miss lire, while below they are con- iiectetl, at the anterior margin of the perineimt, by a broader posterior cummissure. When the parts are here drawn asunder, a second fold appears within the former, just below the entrance of the vagina. The transverse boat- shaped furrow between these constitutes the fossa nav'iciilaris. Beneath the cutaneous and nmcous covering of the labia is found a layer of dartoid tissue, the rest of their substance being formed of loose^6/ o«.s and adipose tissue. The labia represent the scrotum, which in the early fcetus is divided into two halves. A raphe indicates in the male the line of their subsequent confluence. In the female the two halves remain permanently separate. The normal descent of the testis into the scrotum in the male, about the seventh month of intra-uterine life, is represented by the ab- normal descent of the ovary into the labia of the female which constitutes ovarian ingui- nal hernia. (See p. 574.) When the labia are drawn asunder, the clitoris, the vestibule, nymphas, and vaginal orifice are brought into view. The Clitoris (figs. 481. and 482.), in general form and composition, resembles, oh a diminutive scale, the penis, but it is deficient in some of the parts which compose the latter organ. The clitoris lies in the upper part of the vulvar fissure, concealed between the labia, and encased in a fold of mucous mem- brane, the lower border of which forms a hood or prepuce {prepiiHiim cliforidis) (fig- 480,^;f), that terminates just above the superior com- missure of the nynipha?, and allows the ex- tremity only of the organ to appear. When this covering is removed, the clitoris is seen to consist of the following parts : viz. a suiall im[)erforate glans (fig. 481. c), com- posed of spongy erectile tissue, and covered by a highly sensitive mucous membrane, which is abundantly supplied with nerves; this terminates the free extremity of the organ : a bodt/ (fig. 481. 6), consisting of two cor- pora cavernosa, united along the median line, and invested by a fibrous tunic. The body extends upwards and backwards to a [)oint a little above the centre of the pubic arch. Here it makes a sudden downward curve, and, after dividing into two crura, is attached by these beneath the iscio-pubic rami of either side. Opposite the point of curvature, a flat- tened siispensori/ ligament attaches the body of the clitoris to the pubic symphysis. Two ischio-cavernous muscles (crcctores chtorides), composed of striped muscular fibre, are in- serted into the crura. They have the same relations, and, accoriling to Kobelt, are billy as long as in the male (fig. 483. «).

Fi'oin the cavernous bodies the blood is also collected by a series of vascular canals, of which an account will be presently given. Nerves.— The clitoris is richly endowed with nerves, ii, which are relatiieli/ three or four times larger than those of the penis. They pass along the sides of the clitoris, each dividing usually into three branches, the ulti- mate ramifications of which lose themselves

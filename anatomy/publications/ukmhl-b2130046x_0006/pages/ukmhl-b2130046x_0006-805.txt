713 EXTERNAL ORGANS OF GENERATION. ciilar structure (/f:. 483. b and c), which has been usually regarded as the constrictor of the vaginal orifice, but which Kobelt considers to be more particularly employed as a com- pressor of the parts j\ist named. This muscle takes its origin in a broad flattened base {h") from the perineal fascia midway between the anus and tuber ischii. The inner fibres inter- lace with those of the sphincter ani, while the outer ones reach to the corresponding ascend- ing ischial ramus. Thence the muscle be- comes gradually smaller as it ascends, and after embracing the entire length and breadth of the vestibular bulb, it converges forwards to meet its fellow at the clitoris, where it termi- nates in two little flattened portions of which the posterior passes as a narrow tendon {Jig. 483. d) to unite with its fellow between the upper end of the bulb and the root of the clitoris, while the anterior looser portion (f) mounts over the dorsum of the clitoris, form- ing the musculus attruhcns clitoridis. This serves to depress the organ and com[)ress the dorsal vein, at the same time that the lower portion of the same muscle, by com- pressing the rest of the vascular a|)[)aratus, forces the blood out of the vestibular bulb and pars intermedia upwards into the body of the clitoris, and thus aids in producing congestion and erection of all these parts during coition.

S/ovd-vessch vf the external organs. — The arteries are supplied by the terminal branches of the internal pndics and from branches of the femoral. The pudic sends off two branches : the first, or lower (jtiperjicial perineal branch), terminates in the labium after supplying the sphincter vaginae and some of the jierineal muscles. The second, or superior, mounting along the ischio-pubic rami to the tlivision of the crura clitoriilis, sends off a branch {artery (if the bulb) to the bulbus vestibuli, and then separates into two terminal twigs, the one {profunda branch) entering the cavernous sub- stance of the clitoris, while the other forms the dorsal artcrij of that body {Jig. 48 i. h). The femoral supplies the external])udics, two in number on each side, which arise by a common trunk or singly from the inner side of that vessel. The superior of these branches {superior pudenda exter)ia) arises near the cru- ral arch and, passing inwards, sends off two branches, one to the mons veneris and lower |)art of the abdominal integuments, the other, terminating in the labium, sends also twigs to the nympha and preputium clitoridis. The inferior branch {inferior pudenda externa), arising a little below the former, or from the profnntla, passes obliquely towards the labium in which it terminates, anastomosing also with the snperfu'ial perineal branch of the pudic.

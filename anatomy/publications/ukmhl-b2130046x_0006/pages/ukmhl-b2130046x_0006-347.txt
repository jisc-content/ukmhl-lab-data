REPRODUCTION, VEGETABLE (Vegetable Ovum). 2.57 ■ Zoosporous Unicellular Alga. Conjugating Unicellular Alga. Protozoon.* Production of a series of Zoospores. Cessation of motion.

Conjugation followed by Cessation of growth. * In the zoosporous Algfc, constantly recurring series of unisexual generations are produced indefinitelj^ 111 Vorticella the production of Monads may also recur repeatedly, without the intervention of any sexual stage. So long as this is the case the two developments correspond completely. Here it maj' be observed that in the stage of cessation of growth, which, in the Pro- tozoon, as well as in the Protophyton, follows the act of conjugation, we have a condition which corresponds to that of the ovum of the higher animals. The ovum after passing through a period of repose, resembling that which presents itself in Podophrya, exhibits a series of transformations, which correspond to the later steps of the developments under our consideration. This correspondence is, as might be expected, more distinctly seen in the lower than in the higher animals. Thus for example, in the development of a Trema- tode Worm (Distomum pacificum), the mass of the yolk is transformed into a locomo- tive rudiment resembling an infusory animal. Within this originates an asexual, but fertile nurse, the homologue of the Vorticella, in the interior of which is formed a second and numerous generation of animals endowed with locomotion (Cercariffi). In these, after a time, the locomotive power is lost, and each finally becomes a sexual Distomum.* Although the foregoing homologies are founded on observations the details of which are as yet imperfectly worked out (on which account it may seem somewhat premature to draw attention to them), they are not open to the objections which may be urged to homo- logies supposed to exist between the highest members of the two series. There, the con- necting links are wanting; here, we pass through closely related intermediate forms, from the Alga to the Protozoon, and from the Protozoon to the Trematode Worm. Hence, while we are not justified in applying the term ovum to the generative product of the phanerogamous plant, the present state of our knowletige allows us with propriety to compare with the ovum the result of con- jugation as it occurs among the Algje. The differences in chemical composition which exist between the Algae and the Pro- tozoa will not serve as a ground of distinc- tion. Euglena is invested during its period of repose with a cellulose membrane and contains granules of chlorophylle. In Poly- toma uvella we find, on the one hand, the contractile vesicles of the infusory animal, on the other, starch in the granular form, so characteristic of the plant."]" (.7.

290 RESPIRATION. gill-bearing arches are not composed of single undivided curved bones, but of several ele- ments, adjusted with express reference to the elasticity and flexibility of the whole. Six of these arches are primarily developed, and five permanently retained. Tiie first four support gills, the fifth is beset with teeth which guard the opening of the gullet: this latter is termed the pharyngeal arch; the rest the branchial arches. From the convex side of the branchial arches a double series of interlocking; penknife-shaped processes radiate. On the flat surfoces of these pro- cesses a gorgeous arrangement of mem- branous leaflets is disposed in a transverse manner, each leaflet standing, as already de- scribed, on its edge(^g. 237.). This rich foliage, bea>-ing the complex web of the res()iratory capillaries, is itself sustained by a machinery of elastic solid parts, hitherto unknown in comparative anatomy. The series of curvilinear bones denomin- nated the arches of the branchise, and exhi- bited in section at a, fig 237., are inferiorly attached to the sternal chain of bones, pro- ceeding upwards and backwards, and describ- ing a curve, which in different genera varies in degrees of sharpness, and which finally affix themselves by means of ligaments to the base of the cranial bones. These curved bones are constructed of several separable pieces, adjusted with artful reference to the resilient properties of the curvilinear figure. The act of opening the month in the fish deter- mines a consecutive series of movements, which end in the preparation of the gills to be traversed by the branchial current. By an appropriate intervening mechanism the move- ments of protruding and retracting the mouth occasion irrespectively the approximation and separation of the branchial processes, acconi- panied by an alternate increase and decrease of the curvature of the sustaining arch. The straight penknife-shaped processes (1, 2. jig. 239. .r.), as stated, diverge from the convex- ities of the branchial arches. In nearly ail the osseous fishes, these processes form a double series, the gills being accordingly dis- tinguished as b'lserial. In those genera in which these processes form a single line the gills are said to be unisenal. In the genera coitus (bull-heads), lahroida; (rock-fish or wrasses), sebastes, (Norway haddock), scorpajnidiE (hog-fish), Teidas (John Dory, &c.), the nilotic-fishes, polipterui;, gobroidae (blennies and gobies), le'padogaslidix, a genus of small sucker-fishes), and the cyclopteridas or lump-fishes, may be ranged under one great group, characterised by three biserial and one uniserial gill.

Skeleton, by Mr. Maclise. I wish only here to observe, that the branchial arches appertain to the apparatus of the visceral skeleton, and in antero- posterior order succeed the hyoid arch, on the key- stone of which tlie}' are more or less dependant, and the altered configuration of which they more or less follow. the diodons (commonly called the sea porcu- pines), and that curious genus of monop- terus found on the seas of the MoUuccas, the gill opening in which is united by transverse partitions of membrane, are characterised by three symmetrical biserial gills. Other le^s regular genera present other diversities in the disposition of the branchial processes * The penknife-sha[)ed processes (^fig. 237.), which radiate from the convexities of the branchial arches are bony in the osseous fishes; but only that part of the solid basis of the process is bony which corresponds with and forms the substance of its blunt or thick margin. In the cartilaginous orders this por- tion is composed of cartilage, the component cells as well as the outline of which are very dissimilar to those of the former class. As in- dicated in the above illustration, that piece in the skeleton of the branchial process which forms the obtuse border exhihiis a groove seen sectionaliy at (6, fig. 237.), serving for the lodgenjent of the processal branch (g) of the branchial artery. The internal edge of this bony piece is dentated by |)ro- jecting spines, adapted perfectly to support Fig. 238.

The 'pt-nis is long and usually bent upon itself, in the form of the letter s a little anterior to the bulb. In some genera the glans is apparently very small in con- sequence of its attenuation, as in the bull. In all cases the canal of the urethra ends in front by an extremely narrow whip-like process of the corpus spongiosum, remind- ing us of the modifications of this organ in certain mollusks. The prejiuce is prolonged forward in the form of an elastic sheath, which in the Girafte is so closely adherent to the bulbous root of the glans, as to be with difficulty separated ; by putting the parts a little on the stretch, we have found the re- flection fully two inches posterior to the glans. Preputial follicles abound in the An- telopes and Cervidae, and in the Musk-deer there is a special glandular pouch commu- nicating with the cavity of the prepuce by a single duct; it is from this structure that the substance musk is derived. Female organs. — Generally speaking the ovaria (k,Jig. 366.) and fallopian tubes (k) have the same relation to each other as in other mammifera, but differences exist in regard to the connection of these parts with Fis. the broad ligaments in the cameline and horned ruminants severally. They have been indicated by Prof. Owen as follows * — " In the Camel the greater part of the capsula ovarii is formed by the expanded fimbriated aperture of the oviduct itself, which is of very large size, and which encloses the ovarium. In Deer, Antelopes, and Cows, theovari' n is lodged in a depression or sacculus of the broad ligament, which is more or less deep, and has its apertures more or less contracted in different speciesl In the Giraffe thejom- toncal sacculus of the ovary, formed by an expansion of the broad ligament of the uterus, is wide and deep, and encloses almost the whole of the ovary. The fimbriated ex- tremity of each oviduct, or fallopian tube, is expanded upon the outer margin of the ova- rian capsule. The inner surface of the pa- vilion is beset with very numerous and fine oblique strice, and is further increased by narrow folds of lamincB converging towards the contracted opening duct. The oviduct forms three or four wavy folds, and is then continued along the walls of the wide ovaria?i capsule to the extremity of the uterine horn, which makes an abrupt curve to meet it." In all ruminants, as in Solipeda and several other mammalian orders, the cavity of the uterus (a, fg. 366.) is prolonged superiorly 366.

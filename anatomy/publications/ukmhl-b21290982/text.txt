GORDON iBEODIE, F.R.C.S. LATE SENIOB DEMONSTRATOR OP ANATOMY, MIDDLESEX HOSPITAL MEDICAL BCUOOX< ASSISTANT SURGEON NORTH-WEST LONDON HOSPITAL WITH PLATES DKAWN AND LITHOGRAPHED BY PEECY HIGHLEY IN SEVENTY-THEEE COLOUEED PLATE3 (FIVE FULL SIZE, THE BEST TWO-THIRDS NATURAL SIZE) AND THIRTY-SEVEN DIAGRAMS WHITTAKEE & CO. LOiNDON AND NEW YORKI'RINTED BY SPOTTISWOODE AND CO. LTD., LONDON COLCHESTER AND ETONPEEFACE In designing these plates the author has had in his nxind the valuable assistance rendered to him in the first years of his curriculum by the magnificent plates of Professor Ellis, which, however useful they may be, are too large to be portable, and too expensive for the majority of students to obtain. In order to get over this difficulty, the plates, with the exception of five, instead of being life-size, are reducsd by one-third, thiis making a convenient and portable book; and it is hoped that the price will place these ' dissections ' within the reach of all those who care for a graphic representation of anatomy. A picture or diagram of anatomy is far more useful in fixing the position of parts than a mere written de- scription, and impresses them on the memory in such a manner, that they are easily recalled when engaged in surgical or medical work. The best illustration is the body itself, and it is here that the student must lay, hy careful dissection, a good and sound foundation of his anatomical work. The author ventures to place these plates before the student as portraying the different structures in their normal positions, which he Has to search for and display during his dissections. Thus they will serve as models and, further, will recall the work already done when revising his anatomy previous to an examination. And when, in after years, he has settled down into the staid and prosperous practitioner, the author hopes that, should any anatomical difficulty arise when there is no subject to refer to, these plates may serve to fill a gap by showing the relations of the different structures to one another, and thus recall work long since relegated to the background. The dissections only aim at showing the ordinary details which any careful worker can dissect out for himself, and not unnecessary minutiee. The various structures have been kept as closely as possible in their normal relations to each other. Finding it impossible in some of theiv PEEFACE dissections on the head and neck to crowd all the necessary detail into plates only two-thirds the natural size, full-size ones were substituted, and in order to give a good view of the anterior wall of the abdomen two double plates have been introduced. The diagrams, upon which much time has been spent, are mostly from original work done by the author during his demonstratorship at the Middlesex Hospital Medical School; those in the First Part—the upper limb—being found too small, the rest have been drawn upon a larger scale and in a bolder method. And here I must express my gratitude to Professoe Cunningham and Dr. Eolleston for kindly giving me leave to reproduce diagrams in the ' abdomen ' (Part IV.), which I hope wiR prove useful to a better understanding of its anatomy. To Mr. Percy Highley great credit is due for the masterly way in which he has both drawn from nature and placed the plates on stone, and for rapidly grasping and representing artistically the intentions of the author. All the bony outlines of the cuts have been drawn from the skeleton, and in introducing the outline of the bones—a new feature —the relative positions of the bony landmarks to the cutaneous tissues have been shown. To Mr. Pobbin and Mr. A. G. Noble the author returns sincere thanks for their help in making some of the dissections, the former chiefly in Parts I. and II., and the latter especially in the last Part, where his name will be found conjoined with that of the author. To Mr. E. T. Kent, F.E.C.S., the Dean of the St. Mungo School of Medicine at Glasgow, the author is much indebted for kindly placing at his disposal the necessary material for the dissection of Plate 73. The author returns his sincere thanks to Dr. Guthrie, who kindly read through and criticised the letterpress of the last two Parts and made many valuable suggestions as to its revision. Nor would this Preface be complete without a reference to the great kindness with which the author was treated by his old teacher and friend —the late Mr. Arthur Hensman—both in the granting of material upon whi(;h to make the dissections, and in the kindly criticism of the First Part. 0.

THE AXILLA, SUPERFICIAL VIEW. The cutaneous nerves which supply the front of thorax and upper arm are indicated by black hues in the accompanying diagram, viz. :— (a) Sternal, (b) clavicular, (c) acromial branches from the cervical plexus (3 and 4 c) ; {d) anterior, and (e) lateral cutaneous branches of the inter- costals; (/) branches from circumflex ; (g) upper branches of the internal cutaneous. The position of the bones is shown in faint outline. The AXILLA is a pyramidal space with the base directed downwards and outwards, and covered in by dense fascia ; and the apex directed upwards and inwards between the clavicle and first rib. The boundaries are :— In front: Pectoralis major and minor, costo-coracoid membrane, and subclavius muscle. Behind: Subscapularis, latissimus dorsi, and teres major muscles. Externally : Coraco-brachialis and biceps muscles, and humerus. Internally : About five ribs, their intercostals, and five serrations of serratug magnus. It contains the axillary vessels and brachial plexus of nerves running along its outer wall, with their branches. Lymphatic glands : one set along the line of the vessels receiving the lymph from the arm; another along the edge of the pectoralis major, receiving the lymph from the breast and front of thorax ; and a third set along the line of the subscapular vessels, receiving the lymph from the back of thorax. There are also latei'al branches of the intercostal nerves, and the space is filled with a packing of fat. The intercosto-liuvieral nerve, the lateral cutaneous branch of the second inter- costal nerve, usually sends a branch to join the nerve of Wrisberg ; but if the latter is larger than usual, it will in turn give off one to join the iutercosto-hurneral, as in the plate. The first intercostal nerve usually sends no lateral cutaneous branch, but it is occasionally present {vide Plate III.) and then generally joins the nerve of Wrisberg, giving a twig to join the intercosto-humeral. The nerve-twig marked (7) is a special branch of the musculo-spiral to the lower fibres of the internal head of the triceps, and from its course parallel to, and being sometimes bound up with, the ulnar nerve, it is called the ulnar collateral. The ])osterior or long thoracic is also known as the external respiratory nerve of Bell. 132 ft o 'G CO <0 ^ o c3 2 a CD o a> ft o 03 O . o •G g .3 -S S M a -c^ w to to V-l o o ^; c6 ctf O CD be in o ^ «.s o3 O S3 0 S o3 _S ^ o 1 ft"^ P-i D O S CO <» a; r3 CD CO rH a:) CO ft ft tic oT ft C ■ 2 CD ft. 03 o CO o3 CO CO <D 3 .rH <U O J° cs S s-i o H &^ U LU u- CD ni CO CQ CQ 1 i so c3 .2 i 03 O S3 '3 2 '-' o o =2 CO o ft o3 C3 S c3 03 <1> O !^ _ o O (D CD \3 •> >-^ i-^ ?H CD m 00 o S i-q o o 1—I d CO c3 3 >> ft 2 S3 s 5 g .2 cn d CO 0) H 2 EP ^ 0 03;^ P ^ g CD o 0) ^ -.si o 2 s g Sb.2 g| 2 ft 03 =3 O O -3 QJ CP OJ 3 f-, Oh CC <« QQ o O . 3 3 fl g k . g CO >1 O ft ^ s- r; ce :2 S ^ ?1 r=; rz: 7; ^1 o 3 => ^ <: piH :/2 <3 o 'vS 43 fcC ^ o CO ^/^ — CD ^ ti> ^ 1-^ CM CO p; o ft 3 ft O O m "3 .2 S a >,-^ - ~ o3 60 03 ^ _, to o: 03 03 c^JPLATE II THE AXILLA, DEEP VIEW. The pectoralis major has been cut across about its centre, and the ends turned inwards and outwards in order to expose the pectoralis minor and the deeper parts of the axilla. The costo-coracoid membrane was extremely thin, and was removed with the fibro-areolar tissue lying between its lower edge and the upper border of the pectoralis minor ; the sheath of the vessels was also removed. It is a deeper dissection of the same axilla, as m Plate I. The plate shows well the doubling up of the fibres of the pectoralis major at their insertion, the inferior fibres of origin being folded up so as to lie beneath the upper ones, thus havmg a higher msertion into the humerus along the outer border of the bicipital groove. It also shows a fibrous intersection, not uncommonly found running between tlie pectoralis minor and the coraco-brachialis muscles from the tip of the coracoid process. In this body the intercosto-humeral, instead of giving a branch to join the nerve of Wrisberg (6), receives one from it (16), the nerve of Wrisberg bemg much larger than usual. The costo-coracoid membrane is a fibrous structure, varying much in thickness in different subjects, which is attached above to the borders of the inferior surface of the clavicle, thus enclosing the subclavius muscle. Its lower border is condensed into a fibrous band, the costo-coracoid ligament, which stretches between the cartilage of the first rib and the coracoid process. The membrane is stronger externally, forming a fairly strong band between the clavicle and the coracoid process. Its deep surface is blended with the sheath of the axillary vessels. Tliis latter is funnel-shaped and derived from the deep cervical fascia covering the scaleni muscles. The costo-coracoid ligament is a representative of the prolonged coracoid element seen in monotremes, etc. ; it frequently contains cartilage nodules.

THE BRACHIAL PLEXUS. This plate illustrates a deep dissection of the axilla and the lower part of the posterior triangle of the neck. The middle third of the clavicle has been removed and the subclavius muscle divided; the weight of the limb has carried it backwards, exposing and tensing the cords of the brachial plexus. The posterior scapular artery arises in this instance from the third part of the subclavian artery : this happens in about 40 per cent, of the bodies examined, and thus may be given as one of its normal modes of origin ; otherwise, it is usually said to arise from the transversalis colli branch of the thyroid axis. The brachial plexus in the plate differs a little from that usually taught, for the anterior branch of the seventh cervical sends a twig to the inner cord of the plexus ; this can be traced almost entirely into the median nerve, of which it is really an aberrant root; while the remainder, instead of joining the outer cord, received a communicating branch from it, and ran on by itself to join the median. The external anterior thoracic arose from the sixth and seventh cervical by two distinct roots, and not from the outer cord as is usually given. Note on the Limb Plexuses.—A few words may be necessary to explain the terms anterior and posterior divisions used in the description of the limb plexuses. Each spinal nerve as it exits from the canal divides into two primary divisions, a dorsal or posterior primary division which supplies the tissues of the back, and an anterior or ventral division which supplies those in the front. It is the anterior (inferior of quadrupeds) primary division that alone enters into the limb plexuses. To go back to the development of the limb, in its primitive state as it buds out from the trunk it has two surfaces, a ventral and dorsal, each of which has its own nerve supply, and thus the anterior primary division splits at once into two trunks, an anterior or ventral, and a posterior or dorsal, for the supply of the respective surfaces. This simple arrangement is well seen in the Amphioxus lanceolatus. In the embryo rat the same thing occurs, all the nerves dividing in this manner, but in the adult rat this arrangement is masked, as development proceeds the embryonic nerves becoming differentiated and complicated in their arrangement pari passu with the develoxDment of the muscular system, and the changes to the adult condition. In all mammalian limb plexuses it will be found that: 1. The inferior (anterior) primary divisions of the spinal nerves entering the plexus divide into anterior and posterior trunks. 2. That dorsal trunks always unite with dorsal, and ventral with ventral, to form the nerves of distribution. 3. The essential constitution of a nerve of distribution never varies, i.e. a nei've coming from a dorsal trunk in one animal never comes from a ventral trunk in another.' Birmingham considers that the lesser internal cutaneous (N. of Wrisberg) is the posterior or dorsal division of the first dorsal nerve, because when the nerve is absent its place is taken by a lateral cutaneous from first dorsal, the portion of the first dorsal which passes up over the first rib to join the brachial plexus then passing at once into the anterior (ventral) division of the nerves ; also the first intercostal does not fully represent the ventral element of fiist dorsal, because it usually gives no anterior \;utaneous branch.^ ' Dr. Patterson, Journal of Anatomy and Physiology, vol. xxi. p.

In this plate is delineated the arrangement of the superficial veins and cutaneous nerves at the bend of the elbow; the basilic vein has been afterwards traced up to the, point where it pierces the deep fascia to join the ven^e comites of the brachial artery. The common arrangement of these veins is as follows :—the vieclian vein (a), which begins in radicals over the ball of the thumb, runs up the middle of the forearm, and divides into two about the lower border of the bicipital fascia—an inner branch, the median basilic (e), and an outer, the viedian cephalic [h)—giving off a branch {k) which pierces the deep fascia of the arm to join the deep veins. The median cephalic is joined just above the outer condyle by the radial vein (c), which begins in radicals upon the dorsal aspect of the first interosseous space, and runs up the outer side of the forearm pos- teriorly, turnmg forwards at the elbow to join the median cephalic. The conjoined vein is then termed cephalic (d); it runs up along the outer side of the biceps, piercing the fascia opposite the insertion of the deltoid, and, coursing up between this muscle and the pectoralis major, it pierces the sheath of the axillary vessels, and opens into the third portion of the axillary vein. It may communicate with the external jugular by means of a branch passing over the clavicle. The median basilic—the inner and usually the larger branch—is joined by the anterior (h) and posterior ulnar veins ((/), either separately or conjointly, opposite the internal condyle ; it is then called the basilic vein, and, running up the inner side of the arm, pierces the fascia about the middle, joining the venas comites of the brachial to form the axillary vein. The anterior ulnar vein begins in radicals over the hypothenar eminence (the ball of the little finger), while the posterior begins in radicals upon the dorsal aspect of the fourth interosseous space, receiving the vein of the little finger (vena salvatella). The arrangement of these veins may be likened to an ornamental M, but this is not always well marked. c8 PLATE IV. MUSCLES riacecl on the deep fascia of the arm over the biceps muscle.

It may be taken as a general rule that the external cutaneous nerve passes beneath the median cephalic vein, and that one or two branches of the internal cutaneous nerve usually pass over the median basilic, while the others pass beneath it. It is important to remember that the median basilic vein is only separated by the bicipital fascia from the brachial artery which lies beneath it; and thus, in the olden days when bleeding was the fashion, the artery was frequently injured, and arterio-venous aneurisms were not uncommon. Supra-condyloid lymphatic gland.-—This, the lowest lymphatic gland (or glands) in the arm, is placed about an inch above the internal condyle, along the course of the basilic vein ; it receives all tlie lymphatics from the ulnar side of the forearm and fingers, and most of those from the radial; some lymphatics from the latter, however, running up along the cephalic vein to reach the glands in the axillary space.EHigWeylilh Dissected byC.G, Brodie Hanhart impPLATE Y THE INNER VIEW OF ARM AND BRACHIAL ARTERY. The cutaneous nerves of the front of the arm are (a) circum- flex ; (b) intercosto-humeral, just along the anterior fold of the axilla; (c) the internal cutaneous, a branch of which pierces the fascia above the main nerve ; {d) the upper external cutaneous branch of the musculo-spiral; (e) the lesser internal cutaneous ; (/) the external cutaneous. The inferior profunda artery is occasionally absent, and is also very variable in size and origin, and may arise in conjunction with the superior profunda, then running down with the ulnar nerve. In the plate it is shown arising by two trunks, one which has been called the inferior profunda (/) (firstly because it arises icom about the normal place of origin, and secondly because it pierces the internal intermuscular septum), the other which is called an accessory branch (c), and arises from the superior profunda. Another branch of the brachial, the vas aberrans, ' usually present, but often as a minute vessel, not admitting complete injection, arises close to or with the superior profunda, and descends over the median nerve supplying the biceps. Its downward continuation, when present, joins either the radial artery, or more rarely the ulnar, and may be minute, moderate or large enough to replace, or simulate the brachial, which then appears to overlie the median nerve. When of moderate size, it may replace the brachial origin of the radial (rarely the ulnar), giving rise to the common condition called high bifurcation of the brachial.' (Macalister.) Note on the Coraco-brachialis.—Professor Wood' has shown that in mammals this muscle consists of three portions :—1. The coraco-brachialis brevis, represented in man by a fibrous arch, rarely by muscle, arising from the coracoid process and inserted into the humerus just below the subscapularis. 2. The coraco-brachialis medius, or the coraco- brachialis of man. 3. The coraco-brachialis longus arises with the medius, being connected at its origin with the pectoralis minor, and passes down internal to it to join the internal intermuscular septum, in which it is usually traceable as far as the internal condyle. It is usually represented in man by a fibrous band passing from the lower part of the muscle to the intermuscular septum. The coraco-brachial apparatus is found best developed in those animals ' which use the fore limbs for prehension, climbing, swimming, digging, etc., and appears to refer more to the wants and habits, than the pedigree or relationship of the animal.' The musculo-cutaneous nerve may either pierce the medius, or more usually it passes between the medius and longus. * Journ. of Anat. and Phijs. vol. i.10 2 a -I 5§ S c6 O c3 « P-i pq h^l — :^ _i X .2-S- O .S3 ^ 2 m 3 .-S 2 o g <a 1-5 o p g =2 m o a> ^ '-I C30 O !h rd .

This is a superficial dissection of the muscles on the front of the forearm. The bicipital fascia was left to show how it braces the muscles together, and in a muscular subject has a constricting influence upon the contour of the inner side of the forearm. The external cutaneous nerve was not cleared away with the other sub- cutaneous structures, in order to show its communication with the radial; but it must be remembered that, although it appears to lie upon the muscles, yet it is separated from them by the deep fascia of the forearm which has been removed. The accompanying sketch shows the cutaneous nerve-supply of the anterior surface of the forearm and hand : (a) Internal cutaneous ; {b) posterior branch of external cutaneous; (c) external cutaneous ; (d) palmar cutaneous of the median; (e) palmar cutaneous of the ■ulnar; (/) digital branches of the median; {h) digital branches of the ulnar. The palmaris longus is one of the most variable muscles in the body, and may be absent, being then replaced by a fibrous band which occupies the normal position of the muscle.7 Uhiar. 12 PLATE VI.

The flexor sublimis digitorum has been cut away from its radial origin, and its origin from the internal condyle, internal lateral ligament, and coronoid process turned inwards; its tendons have been cut short at the wrist, showing the order in which they pass under the annular ligament. The ulnar artery is thus also exposed with the deep layer of muscles. The relation of the median nerve to the ulnar artery is well shown as the nerve passes between the two heads of the pronator radii teres. If a comparison be made between the radial artery in Plate VII. and the ulnar in this plate, it will be clearly seen how superficial the radial lies and how easily it is reached by merely turning back the edge of the supinator longus, whilst the ulnar is placed deeply and is not nearly so accessible, lying as it does beneath the pronator and the flexor muscles arising from the internal condyle of the humerus. Look out carefully for an occasional fusiform slip of origin of the flexor longus poUicis, which arises from the ulna just below the deep origin of the pronator radii teres, and runs down to join the ulnar border of the long flexor of the thumb. This is, according to Professor Macalister, the remains of the obsolete superficial flexor of the thumb. After finishing this layer of muscles, cut away the flexores profundus digitorum and longus poUicis, and examine the pronator quadratus which lies beneath them covered in by a special fascia of transverse fibres, in which, towards the radial side, are usually to be seen a number of glis'jening longitudinal ones ; they are the degenerate remains of a muscle called the flexor carpi radialis brevior (Wood), which in its fully developed state arises from the radius just above the pronator, and, passing down, is inserted into the second or third metacarpal bone, or, aborting, is attached to one of the carpal bones or fibrous tissue in front of the carpus.IG PLATE VI11.

Tliis plate shows a superficial dissection of the lower part of the forearm, and palm of the hand. The tendon of the palmaris longus after perforating the deep fascia of the forearm is continued into the palmar fascia, which may he spoken of as an expansion of its tendon. The palmaris brevis which arises from its inner border is the remnant of the large muscular palmaris longus which exists in the armadillo, etc., and is there muscular in the whole of its extent.' The palmar fascia with the palmaris brevis is easily reflected from the underlying structures on the dinar side of the hand, but on the radial side the fascia is bound down to the annular ligament at the point where it blends with the origin of the abductor and outer head of the flexor brevis pollicis. The palmar fascia, as seen in the plate, is strong and triangular, being composed chiefly of longitudinal fibres, continuous above with those of the tendon of the palmaris longus, while below they divide into four digital slips which pass along the middle line of the finger, and are closely connected with the skin over the first phalanx. The four digital slips are tied together by transverse fibres, which are collected, opposite the metacarpo-phalangeal joint, into a well-marked bundle called the superficial transverse ligament; each slip also gives off from its deep surface two prolongations which descend on either side of the flexor tendons to be attached to the glenoid plates and edges of the metacarpal bone. An arch is thus formed through which the flexor tendons pass, while between the arches the digital nerves and arteries, and the lumbricals pass to their destination. ' It is the degenerate perforated flexor of the first phalanges.' (Macalititier.) ' For further information, see the Morphology of Ligaments by Mr. J. Eland Sutton.18 PLATE IX.

In this dissection the palmaris brevis and the greater portion of the pahnar fascia have been removed, leaving only the outer edge of the fascia to show where it blends with the origin of the abductor poUicis, and outer head of the flexor brevis poUicis. The superficial 'palmar arch may be completed m three ways: (1) most commonly by the mosculation of the superficial branch of the ulnar with the radialis indicis of the radial; or (2) by inosculation with the superficialis vote; occa- sionally (3) by both. The position of the superficial arch may be marked on the palm, by extending the thumb and drawing a line a b from its web across the palm : this will indicate the summit of the arch. The deep palmar arch is generally about a finger's breadth higher up. (In the outline the artist has not carried the superficial arch quite low enough down.) (c) radial artery; (d) ulnar artery; (e) superficialis vote ; (/) radialis indicis. The diagram also shows in shaded lines the common arrangement of the synovial sheaths of the tendons in the palm, and it will be seen that while the sheaths of the index, middle, and ring fingers are shut off from the common synovial membrane of the flexor tendons at the wrist, about the level of the metacarpo-phalangeal joint, that of the little finger is continuous with it; the flexor tendon of the thumb has, as a rule, a sheath to itself running down under the annular ligament, but in some cases communicating with the other sheath at the wrist. Thus inflammation in the sheath of either the thumb or little finger has a clear path to spread down under the annular ligament, and may do a considerable amount of damage.20 PLATE X.

In this dissection of the pahn, the superficial arch, median nerve, flexor tendons, and hmibricales have been removed in order to show the deep arch. The annular ligament has also been di\dded, and the tendons cut off and left to show their relative position whilst passing mider it. Note on the Short Muscles of the Thumb.—The so-called inner head of the flexor brevis pollicis—at least, the part visible in the plate—is better named the adductor obliquus, because Von Bischoff has shown that the true inner head of this muscle is a small slip which arises from the base of the first metacarpal bone, and passes to be inserted into the ulnar sesamoid bone of the thumb ; whereas the rest of the mass, which usually is known as the inner head of the flexor brevis, is in reality an oblique adductor, while the so-called adductor of Gray, etc., should be called the adductor transversus. A table can thus be established, comparing the muscles of the thumb with those of the great toe:—- Abductor pollicis with the abductor hallucis. Adductor transversus pollicis with the adductor transversus hallucis (transversus pedis). Adductor obliquus pollicis with the adductor obliquus hallucis (the ordinary adductor). Flexor brevis pollicis with the flexor brevis hallucis. a Eadial head. a Tibial head, b Interosseus primus volaris. b Fibular head. The flexor ossis metacarpi (opponens) pollicis has no homologue in the human foot; it is really a segmentation of the outer head of the flexor brevis pollicis ; but in the orang an opponens hallucis, which is closely connected with the flexor brevis hallucis, has been described. The interosseus primus volaris is the true ulnar head of the flexor brevis pollicis. This classification is taken from a paper by Dr. Cunningham in the ' Report of the Challenger Expedition,' vol. v. p. 1S7, to which the reader must be referred for more information, as well as to an excellent paper by Dr. St. John Brooks in the Journal of Anatomy and Physiologrj, vol. xxii.22 PLATE XI MUSCLES A Abductor minimi digiti.

This plate shows a superficial dissection of the muscles at the back of the shoulder, and also the nerves and vessels of the arm from behind, the arm having been strongly rotated inwards. The cutaneous nerves which supply this region are :—(a) Acromial branches of the third and fourth cervical nerves; (6) cutaneous branches of the poste- rior primary divisions of the spinal nerves ; (c) poste- rior twigs of the lateral branches of the intercostals ; (d) circumflex; (e) internal cutaneous branch of mus- culo-spiral; (/) intercosto-humeral. The internal cutaneous branch of the musculo-spiral, as shown in the plate, was smaller than usual, and only supplied the skin about half-way down the back of the arm instead of nearly reaching the olecranon, as generally described. The branches of the intercosto-humeral, on the other hand, were large, and supplied the skin nearly down to the olecranon. The usual branch of communication between the intercosto- humeral and internal cutaneous of the musculo-spiral could not be found. There is generally a fibrous band uniting the tendon of the latissimus dorsi and the scapular head of origin of the triceps, which is the remains of a muscle—the dorsi- epitrochlearis.

In this dissection the attachment of the deltoid to the spine of the scapula has been cut through and the spine sawn across at its junction with the acromion process; the whole muscle and bone were then turned outwards, to expose the circumflex nerve and posterior circumflex artery. When viewed from the back, with the arm abducted from the side, the quadrilateral space or scapular quadrilateral is formed by the bone above, the long head of the triceps below, externally by the teres major, and the teres minor internally ; but seen from the front, the teres minor is replaced by the axillary border of the subscapularis. Coming through the space are the posterior circumflex vessels and circumflex nerve. The branch of the circumflex artery marked (g) passes down to anastomose with one from the superior profunda, and it is this branch that usually enlarges and takes the place of the circumflex when, in abnormal conditions, that artery is not given off from the axillary, or vice versa. The circumflex nerve is a good illustration of Hilton's law, that the main nerve to a joint not .only supplies it, but also some of the muscles which act on the joint, as well as the skin over those muscles, thus securing during movement the true balance of force and friction. The fibres of origin of the infra-spinatuS from the spine of the scapula overlap the upper portion of the origin from the infra-spinous fossa.26 02 O m ^ s CO :^ O tiC O -+3 S3 -ill to O r3 o ^ O CM > X ;^ M QJ to ■ CO "o u 2 a ■ri E"" ^ H fi H H X — s<: _j S z 02 CQ {> pi O oj Oh -t^ c 2 u o CD o 03 02 o Si) CO o o O CO "to a to o P^ to O C g g cc Kl CO O fcC ^ 3 a> <1> CO - '-3 3 a: a; W3 cc 0 o 1 i p> o o . „ « ffi ,q H H •< 03 O O LU U- S g 03 t> Q) O) 3 g g SB .2 ° -2 <u Ol ^ -is ^ JO CO a! -H O O O Ph ^ P 1-1 to ° q 2 ^ 9 oPLATE XIV, THE BACK OF THE ARM AND MUSCULO-SPIRAL NERVE. This plate shows a dissection to expose the muscnlo-spiral nerve as it lies in the musculo-spiral groove. The long and external heads of the triceps have been detached from the common tendon below, and turned outwards ; the fascial expansion, which comes off from the lower and external part of the triceps, and covers the anconeus, has been partly reflected to expose that muscle. The nerve to the anconeus has been traced through the fibres of the internal head of the triceps. The cutaneous nerve-supply of the back of the arm is sho-mi in the adjoining diagram:—(a) Acromial branches of cervical nerves ; (b) cutaneous branches from circumflex ; (c) upper, and {d) lower external cutaneous branches of the musculo-spiral; (e) internal cutaneous branch of the musculo-spiral ; (/) intercosto- humeral; (g) nerve of Wrisberg; (h) posterior branch of the internal cutaneous. The close proximity of the musculo-spiral nerve to the bone, as it lies in the musculo-spiral groove, should be noted, as it is thus rendered liable to pressure- injuries : e.g. pressure of a badly-made crutch may produce paralysis, the so-called ' crutch-palsy.' During the dissection of this region, do not forget to examine the course of the ulnar nerve behind the internal condyle, which it grooves, lying against the internal lateral ligament before it passes into the forearm between the two heads of the flexor carpi ulnaris. Whilst in the groove it is covered by a band of fibrous tissue which passes across from the back of the condyle to the olecranon : this is the degenerate remains of a muscle, the epitrochleo-anconeus, which exists pretty constantly in the lower mammals, including a few of the primates, but is not seen in the anthropoid apes. It is also important to remember the relation of the ulnar nerve to the joint in excising the elbow, lest it should be damaged during the operation.28 o P H 6C CO o ^ c 3 c3 O c:i ^ CD ^ g Qj CO H PL, H c« O CO I— >- X M o • rH CO i-H .2 m o c3 3 o O '3 CD ^ O J _^ CO 2 " § P ^ t- 00 C5 m o to .y o o ™ cS o 'I ° r—I O CO -tJ 3 CD TO g O o II CD ^3 -5 o to g 2 .2 s pq c/2 pel CD o o ^ o ft ft 3 > CO P <-i P 2 g .2 ^ o ^ u .§ ^ .2 o M Q 1^ c3 ft o CO $ s S __ O 43 CS (D rH C3 S S ^ O <U ft •? ft ^ 1-^ <D ,^ CD 6c ft S QJ 5*: _1 S Z O Q_ DC ID to o r3 c3 ft CD O ft jl^ 2 .2 .§•§■■ S ^ O g c3 c^ C-j V} CO c^ s-* <D <D a> rt o ^ ,. ■ . <GQoOllJU.CDX !3 ft ^ CS !-< CI ^ a> 03 -rH ft X 3 pq <1 C/2 2 u cd ,5 a . § CO g g ^ » o) s 4:5i tPLATE XV. THE SUPERFICIAL DISSECTION OF THE BACK OF THE FOREARM. This plate shows a superficial dissection of the muscles on the hack of the forearm. The cutaneous nerves are shown in the sketch plan :—(a) External cutaneous of the musculo-spiral; {b) nerve of Wrisberg; (c) posterior branch of external cutaneous ; (d) posterior branches of internal cutaneous ; (e) dorsal branch of the ulnar ; (/) radial; (g) twigs from the digital branches of the median ; {h) twigs from the palmar digital branches of the ulnar, supplying the lateral aspect of the fingers. The diagram Plate XVII. shows more clearly the nerve-supply to dorsum of hand and fingers. Note on the Anconeics.—This muscle is usually supposed to be a segmentation of the lower part of the triceps, both on account of its nerve-supply from the musculo-spiral, and also the con- tinuity of the lower fibres of the triceps with it; but, on the other hand, in some lizards the anconeus is separate from the triceps, forming a portion of the extensor carpi ulnaris, and its nerve (a branch of the musculo-spiral) supplied also the supinator brevis, afterwards joining the posterior interosseous, and helping to supply the extensors of the fingers. In the alligator, the extensor carpi ulnaris is absent, a large anconeus doing its work, having a double nerve-supply, viz. from the musculo-spiral and posterior interosseous ; this has been noted by Luschka as occurring in man. It may be concluded, therefore, that this muscle is more allied to the extensor carpi ulnaris than the triceps, and that its nerve originally took a larger share in the supply of the muscles on the extensor aspect of the forearm.' It may also be added that the extensor carpi ulnaris arises from the fascia covering the anconeus for a short distance. » The President: Proc. Boy. Acad.

In this dissection the extensores communis digitorum, minimi digiti, and carpi uhiaris have been cut away to expose the deep layer of muscles in the forearm, and the posterior interosseous artery and nerve. Note on the Extensor niedius.—A separate tendon to the middle finger is not uncommon ; it usually arises by a muscular belly attached to the posterior surface of the ulna below the extensor indicis ; its tendon runs down through the same com- partment of the annular ligament as the extensor communis digitorum, but deep to it, and joins the common extensor tendon of the middle finger in the same way as the extensor indicis joins with that of the index finger. Thus the extensor tendons may be divided into two sets—a common set, which is superficial (the extensor communis digitorum); and a special set, of which the extensor minimi digiti is superficial and constant, the extensor indicis deep and constant, the extensor medius deep and fairly frequent; the only one missing being the extensor annularis, which is very rare; but, as Mr. Sutton has pointed out, if the fascia of the forearm be carefully examined, a thin glistening band of tendinous fibres will be seen lying in it, in the intermuscular septum between the extensor carpi ulnaris and the extensor minimi digiti, arising in common with the latter, and passing down to become lost in the fibrous tissue at the back of the wrist. This, in Mr. Sutton's opinion, is probably the degenerate remains of the extensor annularis, which in process of shifting its origin from the condyle of the humerus to the ulna has become lost. This opinion is strengthened by the fact that the extensor minimi digiti does not arise by muscular fibres from the condyle, but takes its origin from the intermuscular septum between the extensor carpi ulnaris and the extensor communis digitorum, as though this muscle also was in process of descendmg from its condylar to some lower attachment. The so-called ganglion on the posterior interosseous nerve is only a thickening of its perineurium.32 PLATE XVI. MUSCLES A Triceps. B Biceps. C Brachialis anticus. D Anconeus. E Supinator longus.

In order to show more clearly the nerve-supply on tlie back of the hand and fingers, the following diagram has been introduced :—(e) dorsal branch of ulnar; (/) radial nerve; (g) twigs fi'om the digital branches of the median supplying the dorsal aspect of the phalanges ; (/;-) twigs from the palmar digital branches of the ulnar which supply chiefly the lateral aspects of the little and half the ring finger. Those twigs on the ulnar side of the little finger could not be shown for want of space. The six different compartments of the posterior annular ligament are, starting from the radial side :— I. For the extensor ossis metacarpi and primi interncdii poUicis. II. For the extensor carpi radialis longior and brevior. III. For the extensor secundi internodii poUicis. IV. For the extensor communis digitorum and extensor indicia. V. For the extensor minimi digiti. YI. For the extensor carpi ulnaris.

In this dissection the superficial fascia and the cribriform fascia have been entirely removed in order to show the saphenous opening in the fascia lata. The cutaneous nerve supply to the front of the thigh is shown in the annexed diagram : (a) external cutaneous branch [2 and 3 L]; (6) the gluteal branch of the external cutaneous pass- ing backwards; (c) middle cutaneous branch of the anterior crural; (d) crural branch of the genito-crural [1 and 2 L] ; (e) ilio-inguinal nerve [1 L]; (/) small upper cutaneous twigs from the internal cutaneous; (g) internal cutaneous piercing fascia lata in two branches ; (h) patellar branch of the long saphenous ; (k) long saphenous. The position of Poupart's liga- ment is indicated by a thick dotted line. The saphenous opening is an oval opening in the fascia lata formed by the difference in level of the outer or iliac and the inner or pubic portions. The iliac portion is attached to the whole length of Poupart's ligament as far as the pubic spine; from this point its inner edge curves outwards and downwards superficial to the femoral vessels, exposing the inner part of their sheath, forming a sickle-like edge—the falciform edge of the saphenous opening ; it then passes under the long saphenous vein to join the inner or pectineal portion. The pectineal portion of the fascia lata passes over the pectineus muscle, being attached above to the ilio-pec- tineal line and Gimbernat's ligament; and, passing behind the sheath of the femoral vessels, with which it is blended, is continued into the fascia covering the psoas muscle. The superficial or iliac portion of the fascia lata, although attached to the front of the sheath of the femoral vessels, can easily be separated by using the handle of the scalpel. Thus the saphenous opening is bounded externally and in front by the falciform edge of the iliac portion of the fascia lata, and internally and behind by the pectineal portion. Stretching across from one side to the other is a thin plane of areolar tissue which is perforated by the various vessels, and hence has been called the cribriform fascia; it is a most indefinite structure, which is attached to the falciform process externally, and joins the superficial fascia internally, and until it is cleared away the falciform edge cannot be well seen. This opening is important surgically on account of its allowing a femoral hernia to exit when it becomes complete : it gives passage to the lymphatics entering the crural canal to join the deep inguinal glandS; the superficial veins, and pudic aad epigastric arteries.36 PLATE XVI IT.

Lymphatic Glands.—These are usually divided into two sets, the inguinal, placed along the line of Poupart's ligament, and the femoral, placed along the saphenous vein. The femoral glands receive the lymph from the dorsum of the foot, the inner side, and front of the legs and thigh. The inguinal maybe subdivided into three groups, an inner, which receives the lymph from the skin of penis, scrotum or labia, anus, and ischio- rectal fossa ; a middle, which receives the lymph from the lower part of the front of the abdomen; and an external, which receives the lymph from the buttock and flank. The femoral sheath is a funnel-shaped structure, which is derived from the trans- versalis fascia in front and the iliac fascia behind as the artery passes under Poupart's ligament; it is divided into three compartments by means of fibrous septa, an outer one for the femoral artery, a middle for the femoral vein, and an inner one, which is very short, containing the lymphatics which pass from the glands in the groin to the deep inguinal lymphatic glands. It is called the crural canal, and through it a femoral hernia passes when present. This canal is bounded above by Poupart's ligament; below by the pectineus muscle covered by the pectineal portion of the fascia lata, and the ramus of the pubes ; internally by Gimbernat's ligament ; and externally by the middle com- partment of the femoral sheath containing the femoral vein. A hernia passing down the canal is thus covered by (1) peritoneum ; (2) septum crurale, which is continuous with the subperitoneal tissue ; (3) fascia transversalis ; (4) cribriform fascia ; (5) super- ficial fascia and skin.2-""=^ EDITICIT .

This plate shows a superficial dissection of the front of the thigh, the fascia lata and the sheath of the femoral vessels having been removed. If the line of Poupart's ligament be compared with that in Plate XVIII., it will be noticed that the ligament is bowed down towards the thigh when the fascia lata is intact; but when this is removed the line of the ligament becomes nearly straight, retracting sufficiently to allow the origin of the deep epigastric or circumflex iliac from the external iliac artery to be seen. Scarpa's Triangle.—This triangle is situated in the front of the thigh, with the base upwards and apex downwards. Its boundaries are:— Base: Poupart's ligament. Inside : Inner edge of the adductor longus. Outside: Inner edge of the sartorius. Floor is formed from within outwards by the adductor longus, pectineus, psoas, and iliacus muscles. Sometimes the adductor brevis is seen between the adductor longus and pectineus : this chiefly occurs in thin and weak subjects. Contents : It contains the common, superficial, and deep femoral arteries and veins and their branches; the anterior crural nerve with its branches; the crural branch of the genito-crural nerve and the external cutaneous nerve. The nerve to the sartorius is usually bound up with the middle cutaneous nerve, but it may occasionally run with the internal cutaneous. In the dissection represented the nerve came off direct from the anterior crural above Poupart's ligament. The genito-crural nerve is not uncommonly united with the middle cutaneous branch of the anterior crural before piercing the fascia. (Macalister.)88 PLATE XTX. MUSCLES A Sartorius. B Iliacas.

THE FRONT OF THIGH WITH THE SARTORIUS CUT. In this dissection the sartorius has been cut through and removed, as well as the fibrous tissue which forms the covering of Hunter's canal, exposing the femoral artery and long saphenous nerve. Hunter's Canal.—After the femoral artery leaves Scarpa's triangle and gets under the cover of the sartorius it lies in a groove between the vastus internus externally and the adductor longus and magnus internally and behind. Here it is covered over by a layer of fibrous tissue, which stretches across from the adductor to the vastus ; thus it lies in a musculo-aponeurotic canal, called Hunter's canal, which extends from near the apex of Scarpa's triangle to the opening under adductor magnus. The canal contains the femoral artery and vein and the long saphenous nerve ; the latter may occasionally run in the fibrous tissue forming the roof. The plate also shows well the relation of the long saphenous nerve to the nerve to the vastus internus. The nerve (11), which is a branch of the superficial division of the obturator, should be carefully traced down from its exit between the adductor longus and magnus; it will be found to send a small twig to the femoral artery and then to pass on, com- municating near the edge of the sartorius with a branch from the internal cutaneous and one from the long saphenous, thus forming an intercommunication, which has been called the obturator plexus (subsartorial), and from which branches are distributed to the skin on the inner side of the knee and hamstrings. It is impoi'tant clinically to remember this in connection with hip-joint disease, for one of the early signs commonly present is pain over the inner side of the knee-joint, and it must be remembered that the same division of the obturator sends a branch to the hip-joint, and this being irritated the pain is referred to the skin supplied by its cutaneous branch.40 PLATE XX.

Highley Uth.1PLATE XXI. DEEP VIEW OF THE FRONT OF THE THIGH. In this plate a dissection of the deeper parts of Scarpa's triangle and front of thigh is shown. The adductor longus has been cut and the middle part removed ; the pectineus has also been divided and the ends turned back, exposing the obturator externus and its fascia and the obturator nerve. The rectus muscle has also been divided : this muscle has two heads of origin from the ilium, a straight head arising from the inferior spinous process and a reflected head arising just above the acetabulum: the latter is the original head of origin in early foetal life, the straight head being a later development, appearing about the third month as a thickening in its sheath. This double origin allows the muscle to act forcibly as an extensor in the different positions of the limb, for in the extended position the straight head will give the point d'appui, while the reflected will act best in the flexed position of the limb. Professor Cleland states that the presence of the straight head of the rectus probably saves that muscle at least half an inch more contractile muscular substance, and is thus an economy to the body. The deep prolongation of the fascia lata beneath the tensor vagin£e femoris is also well shown : it is usually a well-marked and powerful band, and is attached above to the ilium, just below the origin of the tensor. The profunda femoris is usually described as having four perforating branches, one given off above the level of the adductor brevis and piercing the magnus to get to the back of the leg, another piercing both these muscles, and two given off below the level of the brevis and piercing the magnus alone. Very often, however, the first and second are conjoined, and pierce the brevis and magnus ; sometimes there are two branches, and then it is usually the rule for them both to pierce the brevis as well as the magnus. Nerve Supply of Pectineus.—The pectineus of man is usually considered to be a dorsal muscle, and as such would be supplied by a dorsal nerve—the anterior crural. In about 8 per cent, of cases it also gets a branch from the obturator ; when this happens it is probably because the muscle then consists of two separate elements: a dorsal one supplied by the anterior crural, a dorsal nerve, and the other a ventral by the obturator, a ventral nerve. In the horse it consists of two layers, a superficial, supplied by the anterior crural and resembling the pectineus of man, and a deep layer supplied by the obturator and seeming to belong to the adductors, the two being separated by the pubo-femoral ligament. In reptiles this double nerve supply is frequently seen. The muscle is occasionally divided into two parts in man. The accessory obturator nerve which sometimes supplies it would be better named accessory anterior crural, because (1) its origin is more closely allied to the anterior crural than obturator; (2) if it rung with obturator it courses over the pubic ramus; (3) it supplies a portion of the pectineus in place of the anterior crural.^ Mr. Sutton ^ thinks that the ligamentum teres of the hip joint is the lost tendon of the pectineus muscle, for he finds that (1) in the lizard (Sphenodon) the tendon of the ambiens (pectineus) passes inside the capsule to the head of the femur ; (2) in the ostrich (Struthio Camelus) the ligament is continuous with the ambiens across the cotyloid cavity by means of fibrous tissue; (3) in the horse (Equus) the ligamentum teres is in two parts, one being hidden within the joint, the cotyloid portion, and one being attached to the pubes, the pubo-femoral portion—from this band the pectineus partly arises ; (4) in man the hgamentum teres is a fibrous band carrying blood vessels to the head of the femur.

This plate shows a dissection to expose the popliteal space from the inner side, and also exposing the insertion of the gracilis, sartorius, and semitendinosus. A window has been cut in Hunter's canal to show the femoral artery, and also the long saphenous nerve. The origin of the lower fibres of the vastus internus from the tendinous insertion of the adductor magnus is well seen. While dissecting this region compare the difference in level between the origin of the muscular fibres of the quadriceps extensor on the inside and outside, and it will be found that the inner ones arise from the insertion of the adductor magnus nearly down to the condyle, while the external cease much higher up; thus the external are inserted more obliquely than the internal. Bearing in mind that the patella rests more on the outer condyle of the femur than the inner, is not this lower origin of the inner portion of the quadriceps to act as a brace on the patella and counteract the tendency for it to slip still further outwards ? The close connection of the insertion of the adductor magnus into the internal condyle, and the origin of the internal lateral ligament just below it, suggests that these two structures might be related, and in a human foetus of the fourth month the adductor magnus will be observed to be inserted into the head of the tibia, while in the young orang it is directly continuous with the ligament, so that there are reasons for considering this ligament as a divorced part of the adductor magnus.^ The wide aponeurotic insertion of the sartorius is well known, and in dissecting it the lower part sends a strongish slip into the fascia of the leg, the fibres of which can be traced down nearly as far as the ankle: this may possibly be adduced as the reason why the long saphenous nerve has such an extensive skin supply, reaching as far as the ball of the great toe, thus following the law, that a nerve supplying a muscle sup- plies also the skin over the area of its muscular action. A similar instance occurs in the arm where the biceps is inserted through the bicipital fascia into the fascia of the arm : it is supplied by the musculo-cutaneous nerve, which also supplies the skin over the fascia acted on by the biceps as far down as the wrist.

THE FRONT OF THE LEG AND ANTERIOR TIBIAL ARTERY. Two dissections are represented in this plate, a superficial one showing the extensor and peronei muscles in situ, and a second in which the extensors have been separated from the tibialis anticus, and pulled out to expose the anterior tibial artery and nerve. The peroneus longus has also been cut into, showing the course through it of the anterior tibial and musculo-cutaneous nerves. The intermuscular septum between the peronei and ex- tensor muscles can often be observed as a whitish line in the deep fascia of the leg : this is a point to be avoided in ligaturing the anterior tibial artery in its upper third: there is no such white line between the tibialis anticus and extensor longus digi- torum, and the division of these two muscles is often hard to determine owing to the fact that both arise from the fascia of the leg, and that the upper part of the extensor tends to overlie somewhat the tibialis anticus. The division between these two muscles is about half an inch inside the septum between the peronei and extensors. The skin supply of the front of the leg and dorsum of the foot is shown in the accompanying diagram :—[a) Long or internal saphenous, (b) cutaneous twigs from the external popliteal, (c) the two branches of the musculo-cutaneous usually piercing the fascia separately, (e) external or short saphenous, (/) anterior tibial. The nerve supply to the dorsum of the foot varies some- what, but by far the most common arrangement is that shown in the diagram. Sometimes, however, the external saphenous supplies a branch to the inner side of the little and outer side of the fourth, replacing a branch of the musculo cutaneous, and thus supplying one and a half toes. Occasionally in the same way, but more frequently, it may replace the two outer branches of the musculo- cutaneous, and thus supply two and a half toes. The peroneus tertius is not met with except in man, and is a specialised sHp of the extensor longus digitorum, whose use is to raise the outer border of the foot in walking.

' This nerve usually pierces the fascia in two branches instead of one as in this dissection.)PLATE XXIV. THE DORSUM OF THE FOOT. The anterior annular ligament is divisible into two portions, an upper vertical, which stretches across from the tibia to the fibula, and is merely a thickening in the deep fascia ; and a lower or Iwrizontal, which starts from the anterior rough upper surface of the OS calcis, and, passing as a strong band over the tendons of the extensor longus digitorum and peroneus tertius, sends a strong slip behind them to reach the starting- point at the OS calcis : thus these tendons are enclosed in a pulley-like band. The rest of the ligament is not so clearly defined, and consists of two parts, one of which passes up over the extensor longus hallucis and then splits to enclose the tendon of the tibialis anticus before its insertion into the tibia, while the other passes over both the extensor longus hallucis and tibialis anticus to lose itself in the fascia over the inner side of the foot. The pulley-like portion of the ligament is the only part of the lower band which is repeated in most animals, and plays the same part there as in man. The extensor brevis digitorum is an interesting example of a migrating muscle, shifting its attachment. This has been traced by Dr. Euge.' In monotremes the muscle arises entirely from the fibula, the belly for the tendon to the fifth toe being easily separable from the rest, and having a higher attachment to the bone. In thylacine mar- supials the whole muscle arises from the fibula, the tendons passing behind the external malleolus, whereas in Didelphys cancrivora the belly for the great toe has descended to take a pedal attachment from the os calcis, giving a small muscular slip to the short extensor tendon of the second toe, which has its chief origin with the third and fourth from the fibula, the fifth still being highest in origin and separated from the rest. In cuscus and koala two bellies are pedal (2 and 3), and two fibular in origin—the fourth and fifth—which still pass behind the malleolus to reach the foot. In carnivora both the lion and the cat have three muscular bellies pedal in attachment springing from the OS calcis and annular ligament of the long extensor, the inner belly again splitting, while the fifth still arises from a muscular belly high up on the fibula, and passes behind the external malleolus to its insertion. In the monkeys, Ateles and Macacus rhoesus, the fifth tendon is still arising from the fibula and passing down behind the external malleolus in close proximity to the peroneus brevis, while the rest of the muscle is pedal. In man there is a pedal extensor brevis sending tendons to the four inner toes, there being no extensor (as such) to the fifth, but the peroneus brevis always sends forwards a slip to join the extensor longus of the fifth digit, which it joins on its outer side; this is probably the fifth tendon of the extensor brevis which in migrating has lost its muscular mass, and whose sole remains is the tendinous slip blended with the peroneus brevis; it also throws light upon that muscular anomaly known as the peroneus quinti digiti, which is probably a retrogression to the original condition. Dr. Ruge con- siders that the outgrowth of the external malleolus in monkeys and man stops the further distal migration of this muscle, which either perishes, as in the orang, or the belly of its muscle becomes partially adherent with the peroneus brevis (as in cebus), or wholly adherent, as in the chimpanzee, gorilla, and man. > Mo?-]}h.

THE BUTTOCK (GLUTEUS MAXIMUS). This dissection is to show the gluteus maximus : the superficial layer of the fascia lata which covers it has been removed and cut short along the outer edge of the muscle. The cutaneous nerve supply of this region is indicated by the accompanying dia- gram : (a) Gluteal recurrent branch of the external cutaneous [2 and 3 L]. [a') Branches from the external cuta- neous supplying the outer side of the thigh, (b) Lateral branch of the last dorsal nerve, (c) Iliac branch of the ilio-hypogastric. Both these two are derived from the anterior primary divisions of the spinal nerves, (d) Ex- ternal branches of the posterior primary divisions of the first and second lumbar nerves, (e) External branches of the posterior divisions of the sacral nerves. (/) Perforating cutaneous nerve from the third and fourth anterior divisions of the sacral nerves, (g) Gluteal branches of the small sciatic, {h, i) Internal and external cutaneous branches of the small sciatic to back of thigh, (k) Terminal branch of small sciatic which pierces the fascia at the upper part of the popliteal space, and supplies the skin as far as middle of calf. (Z) Inferior pudendal or nerve of Som- mering. (m) Cutaneous branch of the obturator, (n) Pos- terior branch of the internal cutaneous. The other side of the diagram shows Lizars's lines, which are the guides for finding the position of the gluteal and sciatic arteries at the point of their emergence from the pelvis. For the gluteal, bisect the line A B drawn between the tuber ischii and great trochanter at C, and draw a line from this point to the posterior superior spine of the ilium ; trisect this line G E, and the upper point of trisection will be about the point at which the artery emerges. For the sciatic trisect the line A B and join the inner trisection with the posterior superior spine ; this line bisected will indicate about the spot where it emerges from the pelvis. Nor should Nelaton's line be forgotten, as it is important clinically: it is marked out by joining the anterior superior iliac spine with the anterior part of the tuber ischii; it just crosses the top of the great trochanter, and affords a ready means of recognising displacemenfs from dislocations or fractures of the neck of the femur. The fold of the buttock has nothing to do with the edge of the gluteus maximus ; it is below the edge of the muscle at the inner part of the thigh, crossing it externally, and being best marked just below the ischial tuberosity. It is due to the relaxation of the skin in the erect position, and is lost when the thigh is flexed.^ The subcutaneous tissue of this region in many of the negro races is an extremely thick layer, forming a regular pad or cushion. The large size of the gluteus maximus is characteristic of man, its chief use being to extend the thigh, and thus maintain the body in the erect position; even in the anthropoid apes it is not nearly so well developed, and is less again in mammals. The part arising from the coccyx and sacrum may be separated, thus representing the agitator caudse of animals. It has the coarsest fascicles of any muscle in the body.

THE BUTTOCK, GLUTEUS MINIMUS, &c. In this dissection the gluteus maximus has been entirely removed from its origin from the sacro-sciatic ligament, &c., in order to show the plexiform arrangement of the posterior primary branches of the sacral nerves, which He in the ligament covered over by its superficial fibres. The gluteus medius has also been divided and the ends turned aside in order to expose the minimus and the tensor vaginae femoris, the gluteal nerve and deep part of the gluteal artery. Some little difficulty will be experienced in separat- ing the anterior fibres of the medius from those ol the minimus in front and below, owing to their being blended. The superior and inferior gemelli are shown as one continuous muscular gheet lying under the obturator internus tendon, and arising from the edge of the cartilage-covered surface over which the tendon glides : this is the more usual condition in muscular subjects, but often the muscle sub- stance is absent in the centre, and then the muscles have been rightly described as two—superior and inferior gemellus. The dissector should also note that the tendon of the obturator lies on its deep surface next the bone, which is here grooved and covered by cartilage. The accompanying diagram shows mosouier •• more clearly than a description the dis- ttrng^ifidLs Cutaneous tribution and plexiform arra.ngement of ^VAW Cufar.oous the posterior primary divisions of the sacral nerves. As a rule, the three first external branches only become cutane- ous, but the fourth may do so ; the inter- nal branches of the first three supply the multifidus spinae. The fourth usually joins the fifth and the coccygeal to form a nerve twig, which is lost in the tissue at the back of the coccyx. Note on the Crucial Anastomosis.— At the back of the thigh in the neigh- bourhood of the quadratus femoris there is usually described a cruciform anastomosis, composed of the sciatic from above, the internal circumflex from in front, the first perforating from below and the external circumflex coming round below the trochanter through the fibres of the vastus externus ; as thus described it is not often seen. There are generally two large anastomoses at the back of the thigh, one between the sciatic, gluteal, and internal circumflex in the digital fossa, and another usually just beneath the edge of the hamstrings formed of the sciatic first perforating and internal circumflex. The first perforating sends a branch through the gluteus maximus into the vastus externus, and this anastomoses with the external circumflex ; but the latter does not usually come round to the back of the thish. cutaneous from Sk ♦ S anterior primary bnanQhes54 PLATE XXVIL MUSCLES A Gluteus meclius.

In some cases it will be found that the small sacro-sciatic ligament is entirely or partly replaced by fibres of the coccygeus muscle, of which it appears to be a fibrous retrogression ; in the armadillo this is again replaced by bone. ' The muscle substance was very thiu in this body, and there was complete absence of the gemellus superior.PLATE XXIX. THE BACK OF THE THIGH, HAMSTRINGS, AND SMALL SCIATIC NERVE. The dissection of the back of the thigh shows the small sciatic and hamstrings. It is a little less than two-thirds natural size. The gluteus maximus has been drawn slightly upwards in order to expose the origin of the hamstrings from the tuber ischii. When the origin of the biceps from the tuberosity is examined, it will be noticed that a large number of the tendinous fibres of origin are continuous with those of the great sacro-sciatic ligament. In ruminants this ligament is replaced by a thick strong tendon, and it may be taken that the ligament is mainly the continuation of the tendon to a higher origin, which has been cut off by the outgrowth of the tuber ischii. In some of the marsupials the biceps has two origins—a tendinous origin from the tuber with the semitendinosus and another muscular slip which springs from the second and third caudal vertebrae under cover of the agitator caudcs (posterior part of gluteus maximus), and passes down superficial to, and a little to the outer edge of, the tuber, and then joins the main mass of the muscle at its insertion. The use of the second origin is to associate the movements of the hind limb with a heavy tail. The hamstrings are good examples of long muscles passing over more than one joint acting on both, and so tending to co-ordinate their movements, and enabling them to be produced with the least expenditure of power. They are also too short to allow complete flexion of the hip when the knee is extended: this may be tested by noticing the strain required to touch the toes with the fingers when the knee is straight; again the gastrocnemius is too short to allow complete flexion of the ankle when the knee is extended; also the flexors of the fingers are too short to permit full extension of the fingers when the wrist is over-extended. If the muscles be measured in these different positions, the length will not be found to alter, the varying positions of the joints being due to a slight advance of one and retreat of the other; hence, in walking, the rectus, gastrocnemius, and hamstrings are not alternately con- tracted and stretched, but remain equal in length, the advance of one joint compensating for the retreat of the other. Eeplace these muscles by ligaments and see what would occur. Suppose the thigh bent by he ilio-psoas; the hamstrings ligament would at once flex the knee, being too short to allow its remaining extended. Now suppose the limb bent at the ankle by the weight of the body producing flexion ; the gastrocnemius ligament would at once slightly flex the knee, and this would also tend to bring the centre of gravity back to a more stable condition. Thus muscles passing over more than one joint partake of the nature of elastic ligaments ; but being built up of contractile substance, if this contracts at the same time they would act far more effectually than ligaments could do ; and when acting in this fashion as ligaments they are combiners and diffusers, not producers of the movement, the short muscles producing and the long diffusing it: thus they give the short muscles ' an indirect action on the joints over which they do not pass,' and so increasing their range of action. Being also elastic, they give when taxed beyond their strength, instead of rupturing as ligaments would do.' ' Professor Cleland, Journal of Anat. and Phys. vol. i. p. 85.58 PLATE XXIX.

In this dissection the hamstring muscles have been cut away from their origin from the tuber ischii and removed to show the adductor magnus, great sciatic nerve, and the deep portion of the popHteal space. The adductor magnus may usually be divided into two parts :— 1. A posterior portion which arises from the tuber ischii and a little of the ramus of the ischium and passes to be inserted into nearly the whole length of the linea aspera, the more posterior portion of its origin from the tuber running dii'ectly down to be inserted into the adductor tubercle of the femur. 2. An anterior portion, which is somewhat triangular in shape, arising from the rami of the ischium and pubes and passing out to be inserted into the upper half of the linea aspera. It is the upper part of this portion which brings the edge of the adductor magnus up to that of the quadratus femoris, and continues the insertion of the adductor magnus up to the linea quadrati. It is some- times called the adductor quartus or minimus. The nerve supply to the adductor magnus is from the sciatic, which chiefly supplies the posterior portion, and the deep branch of the obturator, which supplies the whole of the anterior and also sends branches into the posterior. Prof. Wilson has noticed on the other hand a tendency for the sciatic nerve filaments to usurp a portion of the muscle usually supplied by the obturator. In the chimpanzee the ischial portion (1) is quite separate from the rest, and is inserted into the adductor tubercle, supplied by a branch of the sciatic nerve, and is altogether more hke an additional hamstring than an adductor. The deep or anterior portion (2) had its lower fibres spread out over and inserted into the greater part of the popliteal surface of the femur, extending as low down as the posterior ligament of the knee-joint; this portion was innervated by the obturator nerve ; and there is thus no difficulty in understanding the channel through which the nerve reaches the posterior aspect of the knee-joint, and when the muscle retires the nerve still persists. Of this fact there are other examples. In the iguana the muscle is supplied from the sacral plexus only."^ The adductor magnus is pierced by five arteries, which come through from the front, viz. three perforating arteries from the profunda femoris, as well as its terminal branch, and the femoral artery.

In this plate the fascia over the popliteal space has been removed and the space cleaned of all the fatty packing material, with which the lymphatic glands have also been removed. (See Plate XXXII for diagram of cutaneous nerve supply.) The popliteal space extends over the lower third of the posterior aspect of the femur, which is included in the bifurcation of the linea aspera, and about the upper sixth of the tibia. It is a lozenge-shaped space whose boundaries are— Externally.—Biceps, outer head of gastrocnemius, and plantaris. Internally.—Semitendinosus, semimembranosus, gracilis, sartorius, and adductor magnus, inner head of gastrocnemius. The Floor.— Femur, posterior ligament of the knee, popliteal notch of the tibia, popliteal fascia covering over the popliteus muscle. The whole is covered with the deep fascia of the leg, which is very strong, and has in addition to the longitudinal fibres some strong transverse fibres bracing the tendons together. The contents of the space are— Popliteal artery—its articular and muscular branches. Popliteal vein and short saphenous vein. Internal and external popliteal nerves, their articular and muscular branches, and in the upper part of the space the small sciatic, which pierces the fascia to become cutaneous about midway down, and deep down the articular branch of the ohturator nerve to the knee.

THE SECOND VIEW OF THE CALF, SOLEUS, PLANTARIS, AND DEEP VIEW OF THE POPLITEAL SPACE. In this plate the gastrocnemius has been removed, having been cut through near its origin and also near its junction with, the soleus to form the tendo Achillis. The aponeurosis of insertion of the sartorius has been turned forwards to show the way in which the tendons of the gracilis and semitendinosus lie on its deep aspect, being incorporated with it. The fibres of these two last muscles can be traced separately into the bone only by cutting them out of the sartorius aponeurosis, a thin layer of which comes down on their deep aspect. The lower portion of the aponeurosis is continued into the deep fascia of the leg, the fibres being traceable nearly as far as the ankle. The semitendinosus and gracilis also send slips to join the fascia. The cutaneous nerve supply of the back of the leg is shown in the annexed diagram : (a) Termination of small sciatic; (b) lower branch of internal cutaneous ; (c) cutaneous twigs from the long saphenous ; (d) cutaneous branches from external popliteal; (e) communicans peronei; (/) communi- cans tibialis (under fascia), the junction of these two (e and/) forming the short or external saphenous. Hhe plantaris muscle bears the same relation to the plantar fascia that the palmaris longus does to the palmar fascia, but it has been cut off entirely from the remainder of its tendon by the outgrowth of the heel. In most mammals this muscle supplies the perforated flexor tendons to the toes, and is far better developed than in man, where it is functionless save that it may feebly assist the action of the tendo Achillis. The tibial origin of the soleus is secondary to the fibular origin, and is only found in man and one or two of the anthropoid apes. (Macalister.)64 PLATE XXXII. MUSCLES A Gastrocnemius. B Plantaris.

DEEP VIEW OF THE CALF, LONG FLEXORS, &c. In this plate the muscles of the calf have been removed, the tendo Achillis having been divided just above its insertion into the os calcis, the plantaris and gastrocnemius entirely removed, while the soleus has been cut away from its fibular origin, leaving the origin from the oblique line and the inner border of the tibia. Lastly, the deep tibial fascia has been removed in order to expose the long flexor muscles and posterior tibial vessels and nerve which lie under it. It is important to bear in mind this deep tibial fascia when ligaturing the posterior tibial artery, for unless this be incised much time will be lost in searching for the artery in the space between the fascia and soleus muscle. The fascia stretches across from the tibia to the fibula, being thin above, where it joins the arch of the soleus over the vessels, and gradually thickens as it descends, joining the internal and external annular ligaments respectively. It will be noticed, on reference to the plate, that very little of the tibialis posticus is seen, it being to a great extent under cover of an aponeurosis, which gives the flexor longus digitorum an origin from the fibula on its postero-internal border; from the lower part of the aponeurosis some of the fibres of the flexor longus hallucis arise. This aponeurosis has been named the deep intermuscular septum, and in well-marked muscular subjects is occasionally replaced by muscle fibres which belong chiefly to the origin of the flexor longus digitorum. The long flexor muscles are repeated in most mammalian orders, forming there as in man the deep layer, the flexor longus hallucis having as its homologue the flexor fibularis, and the flexor longus digitorum the flexor tibialis, the tibialis posticus remaining the same. But while the flexor fibularis exists in all species with but little variation, the flexor tibialis and tibialis posticus may vary greatly in size, and in some varieties of marsupials (Macropodidae) both the latter muscles are either rudimentary or wanting, the flexor fibularis alone remaining. In some of the bats the conditions are reversed, the flexor tibialis being the larger and displacing the flexor fibularis.' In order to render the deep view complete a separate sketch has been added showing the popliteus muscle, and also the lower posterior nerve supply of the joint; the origin of the popliteus from the posterior ligament of the knee, as well as its tendinous origin from the femur, is well shown. This deep view also shows how closely the fibres of the peroneus longus are connected at their origin with the external lateral ligament ol the knee-joint, in fact some of the fibres often arise from its base. In the opossum, ox, and gibbon the peroneus longus arises directly from the external condyle of the femur and replaces the ligament, the tendon having no attachment to the fibula, and thus permitting free rotation. In the human foetus as late as the fourth month the ligament and peroneus longus are in direct continuity, the muscle having but a slight attachment to the fibula. Thus the external lateral ligament is probably the lost tendon of the peroneus longus.- ' Dobson, Journal Anat. and Phijs. vol. xvii. p. 142.

N.B.—The nerve to the popliteus comes off from the internal popliteal, and running down posteriorly to the muscle turns under its lower border and enters its anterior surface; the upper twig of the nerve in the small plate went direct to the superior tibio-fibular articulation.PLATE XXXIV. SUPERFICIAL VIEW OF THE SOLE. FIRST LAYER OF MUSCLES. In this plate the first layer of muscles of the sole is shown, the skin having been reflected. The thick tough subcutaneous tissue which lies beneath it has been removed, and the central portion of the plantar fascia divided ; the posterior portion, from which the flexor brevis digitorum arises, has been left in situ, while the anterior portion has been reflected. The plantar fascia, like the palmar, is divided into three portions, two lateral, which are thin and cover the abductores hallucis and minimi digiti respectively, and a central one, which is very thick and strong, extending from the os caleis behind to the toes in front, and sending down two intermuscular septa which completely shut ofi' the flexor brevis from the abductors of the hallux and little toe. In front this central portion divides into five slips, and after sending a few median fibres along each toe to join the superficial fascia, each slip splits opposite the metatarsophalangeal joint into two, which pass down to be inserted on either side of the corresponding flexor tendons into the glenoid plates and deep transverse ligament. Each slip is thus perforated by the flexor tendons, while between the slips the digital nerves and artery pass to the respective toes. The fascia was originally the expansion of the tendon of the plantaris, which is very large in many mammals, and supplies the perforated flexor tendons to the toes, in some species even running on past the first phalanx to be connected to the second. Owing, however, to the outgrowth of the heel and the pressure upon it, the two parts have become entirely separated, differing in this respect from the palmaris longus, which is still connected with its expansion—the palmar fascia. The first layer of muscles consists of three:—1. Abductor hallucis ; 2. Flexor brevis digitorum ; 3. Abductor minimi digiti. To these is sometimes added another, ■which is called the abductor ossis metatarsi quinti, or Wood's muscle. It is not always present, but when absent as a muscle it is represented by a band of fibrous tissue passing from the tubercle of the fifth metatarsal bone to the outer tubercle of the os calcis. The flexor brevis digitorum is represented in the plate as having only three tendons. This is a common condition, but it more often has a fourth tendon to the little toe ; and when this exists it is slender and weak. In some cases the superficial digital branch of the internal plantar artery (c) anastomoses with a branch from the external, and thus forms a superficial plantar arch ; while the twigs given off from it pass towards the cleft of the toes, and anastomose with the digital branches of the deep arch. Thus it is analogous to the superficial palmar arch. ii68 PLATE XXXIV. MUSCLES A Flexor brevis digitorura.

In this dissection the flexor brevis digitorum has been cut away close to its origin from the os calcis, and the tendons severed from the belly of the muscle and turned forwards; the abductor minimi digiti has been turned outwards after being cut away from its origin; and the origin of the abductor hallucis partially severed, to show more completely the structures which enter the sole of the foot under cover of its origin from the internal annular ligament. The large origin of the abductor minimi digiti from both tubercles of the os calcis and the space of bone between them, compared with the small pointed origin of the flexor brevis digitorum from the inner tubercle, is well shown. The fibrous band marked S is called the ligament of the fifth metatarsal, and occupies the position of Wood's muscle, of which it is a fibrous retrogression. The second layer of muscles in the sole comprises— 1. Flexor accessorius. 2. Tendon of flexor longus digitorum and lumbricales. 3. Tendon of flexor longus hallucis. The tendon of the flexor longus hallucis is connected with the upper surface of the flexor longus digitorum, as they cross the sole, by a strong fibrous slip, which is chiefly traceable into the tendons of the second and third toes. In dealing with the back of the leg it was pointed out that the flexor fibularis (flexor longus hallucis) is very constant in mammals, and in most is of far greater importance as a flexor of the digits than the flexor tibialis (flexor longus digitorum). In a great number of instances it sends slips to all the toes, especially those which are functionally the most powerful; while, with the exception of the bat tribe, the tibialis is a much weaker muscle. In other cases both tendons join, and conjointly form the perforating tendons of the toes. Hence the slip which connects the flexor longus hallucis with the flexor longus digitorum is really the remains of its insertion into the other toes. Conversely the flexor digitorum sometimes sends a slip to the hallucis, but it is very rare to find the two tendons entirely separate: this last arrangement is one which belongs chiefly to the lower mammalian orders. The flexor accessorius is nothing more than a tarsal slip of the long flexors ; it is extremely useful in correcting the otherwise oblique pull of the long flexor, the resultant of the two being a nearly direct pull backwards upon the digits. The nerve supply to the lumbricales is given in most textbooks as the two inner from the internal plantar, the two external from the external plantar, but more usually the three external are supplied by the external plantar, and only the inner by the internal, showing that possibly on account of pressure the nerve supply is removing to the deep surface of the muscle.

In this dissection the long flexor tendons have been cut, and the flexor accessorius divided in order to expose more fully the next layer of muscles, which comprises— 1.

This arch corresponds to the deep palmar arch in the hand, and the communicating artery from the dorsalis pedis will be analogous to the radial.72 PLATE XXXVI. MUSCLES A Abductor minimi digiti.

THE FOURTH LAYER OF MUSCLES IN THE SOLE, DEEP PLANTAR ARCH, &c. In this plate the origin of the adductor hallucis from the heads of the second, third, and fourth metatarsal bones has been removed, and its origin from the long plantar ligament severed. The flexor brevis hallucis and transversus pedis have also been removed from their origin. The fourth layer of muscles comprises— 1. Three plantar interossei. 3. Tendon of the peroneus longus. 2. Four dorsal interossei. 4. Tendon of the tibialis posticus. The two last are sometimes included in a distinct fifth layer. The arrangement of the intrinsic muscles of the human hand and foot is merely a modification of a simple type such as is well seen in marsupials. (By ' intrinsic ' is meant those muscles which do not belong to the long flexor system which includes flexor brevis digitorum, accessorius, and lumbricales.) This is— 1. A plantar layer of adductors to each toe. 2. An intermediate layer of paired y?exores to each toe. 3. A dorsal layer of adductors to each toe. In all cases the marginal muscles, abductor hallucis and minimi digiti, tend to reach backwards and to take an origin from the os calcis. Should the hallux or little toe be absent, the dorsal interossei tend to do the same, provided there is no rudimentary metatarsal bone to confine them. Starting from the monotremes (Echidna), where there are a full number (five) of adductors, the tendency is for the centre ones to get suppressed until only the adductor hallucis and minimi digiti remain, and then the latter disappears, leaving the adductor hallucis remaining alone. It may also be taken as a rule that the adductors lie above, and the flexores below the external plantar nerve, and that in most mammals the ad- ductors tend to place themselves obliquely or transversely in order to get a greater pull. Now, in the human foot or hand the arrangement of the muscles may be taken in a similar manner, viz.— 1. A plantar or palmar set of adductors, of which the adductor hallucis and trans- versus pedis alone remain in the foot, and the adductor pollicis in the hand. 2. An intermediate set of flexores breves represented by the flexor brevis hallucis for pollicis), the flexor brevis minimi digiti, and three plantar interossei. 3. A dorsal set, abductor hallucis (or pollicis) and minimi digiti, and the four dorsal interossei; the abductors reaching back to the os calcis in the foot or carpus in the hand. The flexor brevis hallucis is a paired flexor, the flexor brevis minimi digiti and third plantar interosseus forming a second pair, the third and fourth toes in the foot and second and fourth fingers in the hand only getting one, and the second in the foot and third in the hand losing its flexor entirely. In the human fcetal foot and hand the whole of the muscles are plantar or palmar, but as development proceeds the metatarsal or -carpal bones widen out, and the dorsal inter- ossei get pressed between them. In most animals the adult stage is similar to that of the human embryo, the muscles being entirely plantar, the bones being too closely compressed to allow room for the dorsal position ; in others, where the bones are close behind but open in front, the edge of the dorsal muscles gets squeezed up between them. In the anthropoid apes they are getting more dorsal, and in man they are dorsal by developmental changes. In most animals, as in the human embryo, the dorsal muscles are single-headed but in adult man they have become double-headed, and taken an attachment to the next metacarpal or metatarsal bone. In speaking of the adductors it was noticed that they tend to disappear from the centre, it being most common to find an adductor hallucis, next the adductor minimi digiti, then come the adductor indicis and annularis ; it is very rare to find the add. medius. The line of centre to and from which the muscles act is drawn through the third toe in most animals as in the hand, so that an adductor medius is not wanted ; but in man, the gorilla, and tamandus, the line is drawn through the second toe.^ ' I am indebted to Professor Cuningham's ' Keport on the Manus and Pes, Challenger Expedition, Zoology, vol. v., for the above information.74 PLATE XXXVIL MUSCLES A Abductor minimi digiti.

THE POSTERIOR TRIANGLE. This plate shows a dissection of the posterioi* triangle of the neck after removal of the cervical fascia which roofs it in, and the dense fibro-fatty tissue it contains. The upper portion of the triangle is that which needs most care, as the connective tissue is extremely tough and fibrous. The Posterior triangle is bounded— In front.—By the posterior edge of the sterno-mastoid. Behind.—By the anterior edge of the trapezius. Below.—By the middle third of the clavicle. The Floor is formed from above downward by the splenius, levator anguli scapulae, scalenus medius and posticus, and the first serration of the serratus magnus appears in the lower and outer portion of the triangle when the arm is strongly depressed. It is divided into two tri- angles by the omo hyoid muscle, which crosses its lower part obliquely, an upper and larger, the occipital, and a lower and smaller—the subclavian, the size of which varies as the omo-hyoid crosses higher or lower above the clavicle. The Occipital triangle contains—- The cervical plexus, and its small occipital, great auri- cular, superficial cervical, de- scending or supra-clavicular branches, muscular branches to the levator anguli scapulte, communicating branches to the spinal accessory (those from the third and fourth also supplying the trapezius), the spinal accessory, upper cords of the brachial plexus, nerve to the rhomboids, and nerve to the subclavius, the supra-scapular and origin of the posterior thoracic. The transverse cervical, superficial ascending cervical and posterior scapular artery and veins, posterior jugular vein. The glandulse concatenatae along the posterior edge of sterno-mastoid.

In this plate great care was taken to keep the anterior edge of the sterno-mastoid as nearly in its normal position as it was possible. To mark out the course of the external jugular vein draw a line from the angle of the jaw to the middle of the clavicle; the vein runs deep to and parallel with the tibres of the platysma muscle, thus in venesection the incision must be made transversely to the course of the vein, so that the muscle fibres may gape and expose it. The posterior external jugular, very variable in size, is the remains of an im- portant fcetal vein which di'ained the blood from the lateral sinus through the post-glenoid foramen. This persists in the adult as the mastoid vem which communicates with the lateral sinus and empties externally into the posterior external jugular. (Professor Macalister considers this the true external jugular.) The anterior jugular is very variable in size, and its communication across the front of the neck with the one on the opposite side must be borne in mind during tracheotomy, as it is often much congested. In the lower part of its course under the sterno-mastoid it runs parallel to the clavicle, and in tenotomy of the muscle for torticoUis this sliould be remembered.Dissected by C,G.

Ill this dissection the trapezius was completely removed on the right side to expose the complexus and splenius, on the left the splenius was cut away from its origin from the ligamentum nuchse and supraspinous ligament and turned outwards, showing its division into splenius colli and capitis. The complexus was then divided about its centre, and the ends turned up and down to expose the suboccipital triangle which lies beneath it. The suboccipital triangle corresponds to the space between the inferior curved line of the occiput and the level of the spine of the axis, and is bounded Internally.—By the rectus capitis posticus major and minor. Externally.—By the superior oblique. Below.—By the inferior oblique. Floor.—Formed by the posterior occipito-atlantal ligament and the posterior arch of the atlas. Contents.—Suboccipital nerve and its branches to the recti postici, obliques, and complexus ; vertebral artery with some muscular branches and the commencement of the vertebral vein. The following diagram shows the arrangement of the posterior primary branches of the upper cervical nerves. It may be remembered as a general rule that all the internal branches of the posterior divisions of the spinal nerves as far as the sixth dorsal (thoracic) give off cutaneous branches, while the external supply muscles. Below, this arrangement is reversed, the outer branches giving off the cutaneous twigs, and the internal, muscular ; the exceptions being the first cervical, which does not split, and the first two lumbar, which supply no skin branches at all.

This dissection shows as far as pofsible the structures of the face; no attempt was made to dissect out the small muscles of the nose, but the rest of the structures are well shown. The accompanying diagram shows the cutaneous nerves of the head and neck. (a) supra-clavicular (3 + 4 C); (b) super- ficialis colli (2 + 3C); (c) great auricular (2 + 30); (d) small oc- cipital (2 C); (e) great occipital (posterior division of 2 + 3 C); (f) auriculo-temporal (3rd division of 5th); (g) temporal twig of temporo-malar (2nd division of 5th); (h) supra-orbital; (i) la- chrymal ; (k) frontal; (l) twigs from infra- trochlear loop (all from 1st division of 5th) ; (m) infra-orbital (2nd division of 5th); (n) malar branch of temporo-malar (2nd di- vision of 5th); (o) nasal nerve (1st division of 5th); (p) mental branch of inferior dental (3rd division of 5th). There was no divi- sion of the zygomatic muscle into major and minor; in fact the latter is but a slip of the major which has rsniained separate from its anterior edge. Nor is there any sepa- ration, as a rule, between the adjacent edges of the levator labii superioris and the levator labii superioris aleeque nasi, and but a faint attempt at divi- sion ; in fact the whole should be called the levator labii superioris, some of whose inner fibres get an insertion into the alae of the nose. In the chimpanzee these four muscles, the two zygomatic! and the two levators, are united to form one broad muscle which arises round the circumference of the orbit and runs down to be inserted into the upper lip.86 PLATE XLITL MUSCLES A Anterior muscular portion of occipito- frontalis.

FIRST VIEW OF THE PTERYGOID REGION WITH THE MASSETER MUSCLE REMOVED. In this dissection the zygomatic arch was sawn through in front of the external lateral ligament of the jaw and just behind the attachment of the zygomaticus major to the malar bone, and both arch and masseter muscle turned down. The sterno-mastoid and splenius capitis were cut close to their insertion into the mastoid process, and part of the skull on either side of the superior curved line sawn away to expose the lateral sinus. A probe has been introduced into the front of the sinus to show how it dips down- wards, grooving the mastoid process in the fossa sigmoidea. The external auditory meatus is the remnant of the visceral cleft between the mandibular and hyoid arches. The lateral sinus varies considerably in its course, but, roughly speaking, it runs down on the mastoid, opposite the line of reflection of the skin, on to the pinna posteriorly. The ac- companying diagram shows the usual course of the lateral sinus (a) upon the exterior of the skull, and the position of a trephine hole (b) to expose it, the point of a |-inch trephine being placed 1^ inch behind the meatus, and on a level with its upper border, i.e. J inch above the centre of the meatus. Its course, however, varies extremely in its position and extent, but generally it lies ^ inch behind the external auditory meatus; hence in tapping the antrum mastoidea place the drill (c), which should be ^ inch diameter, as near as possible to the posterior edge of the meatus on a level with its upper limit; do not penetrate more than | inch, or the risk will be run of injuring the external semicircular canal; the cells are usually opened at a depth of f inch. If the drill is placed more posteriorly, risk is run of perforating the lateral sinus. The line marked (d) in diagram is Eeed's base line, which is drawn from the lower margin of orbit through centre of meatus, and usually touches the external occipital protuberance or falls a little below it.88 PLATE XLIV, MUSCLES A Temporal.

This plate shows a deeper dissection of the same subject as the previous drawing. The coronoid process has been cut through at its base and turned upwards with the temporal muscle, and the ramus of the jaw sawn through just below the pterygoid fossa and above the inferior dental foramen and removed, exposing the first and second portions of the internal maxillary artery. The first portion of the artery passes between the ramus of the jaw and the so-oalled long internal lateral ligament; it is generally described as giving olf four branches, but it is much more usual to find only two, viz., the inferior dental and middle meningeal, the latter giving the tympanic and small middle meningeal. All these four arteries pass through bony foramina. The second portion of the artery varies in its course, being sometimes superficial and sometimes deep to the external pterygoid muscle, the proportion given on the conjoint investigation of the Anatomical Committee being 54 per cent, above, and 44 per cent, below; this portion of the artery gives off four sets of muscular branches—buccal, pterygoids, temporal, and masseteric, and one arterial comes to the lingual nerve. The third portion of the artery lies in the spheno-maxillary fossa, and gives six branches which all pass through bony foramina alveolar, infra-orbital, posterior pharyngeal, Vidian, posterior palatine, naso-palatine. The long internal lateral or spheno-mandibular ligament is a thin loose band of fibrous tissue which stretches across from the spinous process of the sphenoid to the inner edge of the inferior dental foramen. It is too lax to be of much use as a ligament, and is really the fibrous remains of a part of the Meckelian bar of cartilage.90 PLATE XLV, MUSCLES A Temporal. B Masseter. C Buccinator.

In the dissection represented in this plate the capsule of the temporo-mandibular joint has been cut, and the condyle of the jaw, its interarticular cartilage, and the external pterygoid have been pulled forwards to expose the third division of the fifth nerve which lies behind it. Two saw cuts have been made through the outer wall of the orbit parallel to the floor and roof, and the outer wall partly cut away and partly turned forwards. In chipping away the posterior part to allow a better view, the dura mater of the middle fossa of the skull has been exposed. In the plate the stylo-mastoid artery is shown as a branch from the occipital; this is not unfrequently the case when the vessel is not given off by the post-auricular.

Natural Size. INTERIOR OF SKULL, TENTORIUM, CIRCLE OF WILLIS, FIRST VIEW OF ORBITS. In tins plate the calvarium has been removed in the usual way by a horizontal saw cut, and the brain carefully removed so as to leave intact the arteries composing the circle of Willis in their normal positions with relation to the nerves. The best way of doing this in the ordinary dissecting-room subject is to use a stream of water either from a syringe or tap and allow it to wash away the brain. On the left side the attached edge of the tentorium has been cut into to expose the lateral sinus. The orbits were then opened in the usual manner, but if the dissector wishes to preserve the pulley of the superior oblique in situ, it will be best to place the tip of a finger in the inner corner of the orbit and saw through directly external to it. The arteries comprising the circle of Willis are, the basilar behind dividing into the posterior cerebrals ; the internal carotids on either side in front giving off the anterior cerebrals, which are joined in front by a short trunk of somewhat variable size, the anterior communicating, and the middle cerebrals which are connected by means of the posterior communicating with the posterior cerebrals ; the posterior communicating are very variable in size and may not be of the same calibre on both sides of the body. Thus is established a great circle of anastomosis at the base of the brain.9G PLATE XLVIIL Natural Size. MUSCLES A Tentorium cerebelli.

On the right side the floor and side of the middle fossa has been cut away to expose the external pterygoid muscle from above with the course of the masseteric and deep temporal nerves. The lateral sinuses, if examined, will be found to be unequal in size, the right being usually the larger; it generally receives the blood from the superior longitudinal sinus, i.e. the chief part of the blood from the surface of the brain, while the left and smaller usually receives the straight sinus, which again takes the blood from the central ganglia. In the early foetal condition the lateral sinuses empty chiefly into the external jugular through the mastoid foramen, but as development proceeds this gradually lessens, the internal jugular becoming developed as the chief means of exit. The Emissary veins are those which communicate through apertures in the skull both with the veins within and those without. The chief are: 1. Through the foramen caecum between the superior longitudinal sinus and veins of the nose ; this is often obliterated in adults. 2. Through the parietal foramen between the superior longitudinal sinus and veins of the scalp. 3. Through the occipital protuberance between the Torcular Herophili and the occipital vein. 4. Through the mastoid foramen between the lateral sinus and posterior external jugular. 5. Through the posterior condyloid between the lateral sinus and posterior vertebral vein. 6. Through the anterior condyloid between the occipital sinus and the deep veins of the neck. 7. Through foramen Vesalii or foramen ovale, between the cavernous sinus and the veins of the pterygoid plexus. 8. Through small veins around the carotid artery the cavernous plexus communi- cates with the internal jugular. 9. Although hardly an emissary vein, a communication exists between the ophthalmic vein and the angular, thus connecting the cavernous sinus with the facial vein. 10. A communication exists between the occipital sinus and the posterior spinal veins ; this again is barely an emissary vein in the correct sense of the term. 11. A communication exists between the cavernous sinus and the veins outside the base of the skull through the foramen lacerum medium. 12. A pair of veins usually pass through the foramen spinosum to communicate between the meningeal veins and the veins of the exterior. 13. There is sometimes a vein passing through the foramen rotundum.98 PLATE XLIX. MUSCLES AND FASCIA A Cut edge of tentorium. B Cut edge of falx cerebri. C Falx cerebelli.

In this dissection the constrictor muscles were divided along the median raphe and the pharyngeal aponeurosis partly detached from its upper attachment; the mucous membrane was carefully removed from the soft palate and pharynx. On the left side the posterior layer of the palato-pharyngeus was partially turned back, while on the right it was completely removed. The right levator palati was also divided, and the pharyngeal aponeurosis removed from the border of the pterygoid process, in order to expose the tensor palati. The position of the tensor and levator palati muscles should be carefully studied, as they have to be divided in operations for cleft palate, because they are concerned in drawing apart the edges of the cleft; thus causing tension on the stitches when the edges are sutured together. The enervation of the levator palati has given rise to much discussion, but Horsley and Beevor have discovered that stimulation of the facial within the skull produces no effect on the palate, while as soon as the eleventh nerve was stimulated, that side of the soft palate was at once raised. The nerve supply probably reaches it through the pharyngeal plexus. In the early foetus the anterior pillar of the fauces is a sharp fold bounding a deep recess which was the lower part of the second post-oral cleft; the tonsil is a mass of adenoid tissue developed in the cleft, and above it there is often a fossa—the supra- tonsillar fossa which is a permanent remains of the cleft. The posterior pillars of the fauces are developed later, and divide this pouch into the supra-tonsillar fos«a and the lateral recess of the pharynx.102 PLATE LI. MUSCLES A Superior constrictor. !

Fig. I. shows a posterior view with the mucous membrane removed, to show the nerves and muscles ; Fig. II. a side view, with the posterior part of the right side of the thyroid removed ; and Fig. III. a deeper view of the same, to show the deep portion of the thyro-arytenoid muscle and its connection with the true vocal cords. Morphology of the Vocal Cords.^—Mr. Sutton has pointed out that the false vocal cords of man are connected in front with the inner surface of the thyroid cartilage, and also the base of the epiglottis ; embedded in their substance are the cuneiform cartilagea, and on tracing the false cords backwards to their attachment to the arytenoids, accessory slips will be found connecting them with the cornicula laryngis. In the porpoise there is an azygous epiglottis and an enormously prolonged cornicula laryngis which, though separate, are bound together by dense fibrous tissue. From the base of the epiglottis a process of cartilage projects which is joined by fibrous tissue with a style-like process of cartilage projecting from the cornicula laryngis; and in this fibrous tissue are nodules of cartilage. In the ant-eater there is a well-developed epiglottis, and directly continuous with its body is a process of cartilage which, passing backwards, becomes continuous with that overtopping the arytenoids; this body causes a projection in the mucous membrane and forms the false vocal cord. In the horse there is a thick bar of cartilage continuous with the base of the epiglottis projecting backwards into the false vocal cords. Thus, in man the false vocal cords with the cuneiform cartilages are the degenerate representatives of the piece of cartilage by means of which the cornicula laryngis and the epiglottis were originally united, and, with the cornicula, must be regarded as vestigial structures. The True Cords may be considered as the tendinous part of the thyro-arytenoid muscle, which is intimately connected with it. The Hyo-epiglottic Ligament,—In the horse a muscle replaces this ligament, which has occasionally even in man been seen to be muscular. It attains its greatest development in those animals with an intra-narial epiglottis. ' Bland Sutton, Journal of Anat. and Phys, vol. xxiii. p. 256,104 PLATE LIL Fig. I. MUSCLES, &c.

The lateral recesses of the pharynx, I, are the remains of the dorsal end of the second post-oral visceral pouches which never perforate in the normal human embryo. The dissection illustrated in this plate is one which Mr. Sutton made without freezing for the Middlesex Hospital Museum; several were cut before as good a one as this resulted.

FIRST ANTERIOR VIEW OF THE THORAX. This plate sliows the thorax, with the sternum, costal cartilages, and the anterior extremity of the ribs removed. Great care wa« taken not to open the pleural sacs and to preserve them in their normal position. The sternum and ribs were drawn first before removal, and the outline has been traced in white lines over the plate so as to show at a glance the relations of the various structures to the anterior wall of the thorax. The following diagram has been introduced to show the surface marking of the viscera. Note on the Pleura.—Luschka states that the inner edgft of the left pleura diverges normally from the sternum opposite the upper border of the fifth cartilage and at the level of the sternal end of the fifth rib is about half an inch from the edge of the sternum, while at the level of the sternal end of the seventh rib it has receded nearly one and a half inches from the edge of the sternum. St. John Brooks, on the other hand, after a careful investigation, has shown that this is not the case, but that both pleursB descend under the cover of the sternum as far as the seventh costal cartilage, and thus in some cases of paracentesis of the pericardium the pleura may be perforated, though in others probably the distension of the pericardium has pushed away the pleura from its loose attachment to the anterior walls.108 PLATE LIV.

I Mr. Tredgold draws the following^ conclusions from a close investigation of the ribs of ten genera of primates : (1) that there is a gradual but marked reduction in the total number as we rise in the scale ; (2) that there is a coincident and proportionate reduction m the number of the sternal ribs, and (3) that the 8th rib tends to change from a sternal to a costal one, and consequently (4) the thoracic cavity is shortened, but the capacity is compensated by an increase in breadth.^ ' Journal of Anatomy and Physiology, vol. xxx. p. 289.PL , LIV. 2^*^ EDITIOIT P.HiqhleyKth. Dissected by C.G.Brodie Haiitiart impPLATE LV. SECOND ANTERIOR VIEW OF THORAX. In this plate the lungs have been drawn aside to uncover the pericardium; this has been opened to show the position of the heart and great vessels. Aeby ' opposes the idea that the bronchi divide dichotomously as they pass into the lungs, and states that each tube passes in as an axial stem in the lung substance, giving off branches in definite directions. These branches can be divided into primary, and secondary or accessory branches which are probably only subdivisions of the primary that have become implanted on the axial trunks. The primary branches are in two sets : those given off in front of the pulmonary artery—eparterial; and those given off behind—hyparterial, the latter arise from the outer surface of the stem bronchus and pass in two directions, some ventrally and some dorsally. The pulmonary artery as it passes backwards lies on the outer surface of the axial bronchus, between the two sets. Small and more irregular branches arise on the inner surface of the axial bronchus; these are the accessory bronchi. Thus the arrangement is more bipinnate than dichotomous. If the human bronchi be examined it will be seen that the right one gives off a branch above ^ the place where the pulmonary artery crosses it, this is not represented on the left side, it is the eparterial bronchus : and thus Aeby supposes that the lobe of the lung to which it is distributed is also absent on the left side, and that the middle lobe of the right lung represents the whole of the upper lobe on the left; for all the rest of the bronchi come off below the crossing of the pulmonary artery, and hence are hyparterial. His has shown that in the development of the human lung, the right bronchus possesses at first only two buds which correspond to the eparterial and first ventral hyparterial bronchi; while the left bronchus has but one such bud, which corresponds to the first ventral hyparterial bronchus. The branching on the left side is more profuse than on the right, an especially strong dorsal branch being given off which runs upwards. ' This is unrepresented on the right side and compensates for the loss of the eparterial bronchus. In the sheep and ox the eparterial bronchus of the right upper lobe springs from the trachea, and this condition has been met with in the human subject. In some animals eparterial branches spring from both bronchi and supply corresponding lobes in the two lungs. ' Aeby, Der Bronchialhaum der Sdngeihiere unci des Menschen. Leipzig, 1887.

THE POSTERIOR VIEW OF THORAX. In this dissection the whole of the vertebrae were removed, also the ribs as far as their angles. The body had not been dissected from the front of the thorax, so that everything is nearly in its normal position ; save that, owing to the removal of the con- necting vertebrae, the space has been elongated by the weight of the abdomen and head and neck dragging in opposite directions over the blocks on which the trunk was supported. The obliquity of the higher aortic intercostals is also well shown ; these in the early foetus come off at right angles to the aorta, and it is only after the first year of birth that the obliquity makes its appearance. The posterior mediastinum includes that portion of the interpleural space behind the pericardium and below the level of the fourth dorsal vertebra.

In this plate the anterior view of a nearly full-term foetus is shown. The front of the thorax was removed to show the relations of the thymus gland, and the position of the lungs when not expanded. The ligament of the thymus gland, which was described by the late Mr. Arthur Hensman in Morris's ' Anatomy,' is only present on one side, but it shows in its centre a shght bulging which encloses a small isolated mass of gland structure, such as is often found in it. Very often the hgament is present on both sides, the thymus gland being thus tied up to the lower border of the thyroid gland. The thjmus is developed in the foetus as a bilateral tubular prolongation of the third visceral cleft, which grows down along the side and front of the trachea to join the fellow of the opposite side and so form a median organ. It also receives a portion of the epithelium from the fourth visceral cleft. The thyroid gland is developed from two sources, the lateral lobes as diverticula from the fourth visceral clefts, while the median lobe or isthmus is a median diverticulum from the pharyngeal hypoblast opposite the second visceral arch, which grows down the front of the trachea and unites with the lateral lobes. This remains in the foetus for some time as the thyreoglossal duct, opening on the surface of the tongue in the foramen cascum. If, as occasionally happens, the upper part remains pervious, it is called the lingual duct. In the lower part the pyramidal middle portion or isthmus of the gland is developed, which is usually attached by a fibrous cord to the thyroid cartilage or thyro-hyoid ligament, and is called the ligament of the thyroid gland. This plate shows the relatively small space occupied by the lungs in the foetal chest before inflation. In this condition they are of a uniform, firm texture throughout, and resemble in colour and structure the adult liver; pieces cut off and thrown into water sink. When, however, the lungs are inflated, either artificially or by the efforts of a newly born child to respire, they become inflated with air and are then buoyant in water ; this is taken advantage of in medico-legal cases as a test to find out whether the child has breathed or not.11-1 PLATE LVIL MUSCLES A Thymus gland.

In this dissection the skin and superficial fascia have been removed, and the fossa emptied of its fat. On the right side, the fasciae bounding it deeply have been left intact; while on the left side the anal fascia has been removed to expose the levator ani, and the obturator fascia cut into to show Alcock's canal, which contains the internal pudic vessels and nerve. The deep layer of the superficial perineal fascia (CoUes's fascia) hag been left tc show how it covers the superficial perineal muscles, turning round the trans- versus perinei to form the anterior boundary of the ischio-rectal fossa, and to join the anterior layer of the triangular ligament. Late- rally it is attached to the lower border of the pubic and ischial rami as far as the tuber, and in front passes into the dartoid tissue of the scrotum, becoming continuous with the fascia of Scarpa. In the middle line a vertical septum descends to the bulb, completely dividing the space into two be- hind, but incomplete in front: hence in rupture of the urethra the urine must pass forwards towards the scrotum in order to gain the opposite side ; it cannot pass back into the ischio-rectal fossa because the fascia of Colles joins the an- terior layer of the triangular ligament. If the internal surface of the rami of the ischium and pubes be examined, it will be seen that the inner edge of their lower border turns somewhat in- ward, forming the inner margin of the tuber ischii; this is joined by another faint line which runs along the inner surface of the bone from the bottom of the symphysis pubis. The fascia of Colles (e) is attached to the former, while the latter receives the attachment of the anterior Inneb View of Pubes and Ischium.

THE SECOND VIEW OF THE PERINEUM. In tliis dissection the deep layer of the superficial fascia (CoUes's) has been 13- moved to expose the structures lying between it and the anterior layer of the triangular ligament, while on the left side the crus and erector penis muscles have been cut through to expose completely the anterior layer of the ligament. Between the fascia of CoUes and the anterior layer of the triangular ligament the following structures are contained: the transversus perinei muscles behind; the crura and erector muscles along the rami; in the middle line the accelerator urinae covering the bulbous portion of the corpus spongiosum ; and the superficial perineal vessels and nerves. The central fixed point of the perineum is situated about an inch in front of the anus, and is the meeting-place of the following structures : the transversus perinei, levator ani, accelerator urinae, and sphincter ani muscles ; the latter is the most super- ficial, and is attached about this point to the fascia of Colles and the subcutaneous tissue. This central point is important clinically, for a knife sunk in the centre line and carried a little backwards and upwards would open up the membranous urethra, and it is just behind this point that the knife is entered in perineal lithotomy. The levator ani was primarily a depressor of the tail, but atrophy of that organ and the enlargement of the pelvic outlet have modified the muscle. Its hinder part, attached to the coccyx, is the coccygeus muscle, while the rest forms a diaphragm for the pelvic outlet. The superficial sphincter is also a subcaudal slip segmented from the levator (Macalister).7 Perineal branch of the fourth sacral. 4 Muscular branch from superficial peri- 118 PLATE LIX.

In this view of the perineum the accelerator urinte has been divided along its central raphi and turned aside to expose the bulbous portion of the corpus spongiosum, Tiie levator ani has been severed beliind the central fixed point of the perineum, and the rectum pulled back to expose the prostate and base of bladder, with the vesicular seminales. The anterior layer of the triangular ligament was removed on the left side, to show the internal pudic artery and dorsal nerve of the penis. The following structures are contained between the two layers of the triangular ligament:— 1. Dorsal nerve of penis, and twig to the bulb. 2. Internal pudic arteries, and arteries to the bulb. 3.

This plate shows a dissection of the front of the abdomen : the left side after removal of the subcutaneous tissue; and the right with the external oblique divided longitudinally near the junction of muscle and aponeurosis, and the ends reflected to show the internal oblique. It also shows well the way in which the external oblique muscle arises from the ribs by means of serrations. The deep layer of the super- ficial fascia is thin and membranous, re- quiring great care in dissection to preserve it. It is called the fascia of Scarpa, and unlike the superficial layer, which is con- tinuous with that of the limbs, it is bound down to the fascia lata along the line of Poupart's ligament, passing centrally into the dartoid tissue of the scrotum, becoming inseparable from it, and thence is continued into the deep layer of the superficial perineal fascia. Thus extravasation of urine can pass freely from the perineum into the scrotum and on to the abdomen, but is prevented from creeping down the legs. The external abdominal ring is a triangular interval left between the fibres of the aponeurosis of the external oblique. The upper edge or pillar is shaxp, and passes to its insertion in front of the body of the pubes ; while the lower edge or pillar is rounded (it is the inner end of Poupart's hgament), and is attachcjd to the spine of the pubes. The base of the triangle is formed by the outur part of the pubic crest. Through the ring issues the cord in the male, and the round ligament in the female. The two pillars are bound together by the intercolumnar fascia, v/hich also forms a covering to the cord and testis under the name of the external spermatic fascia. Note.—In this diagram the artist has carried the outline of the splenic flexure too much to the left. On reference to the section given on page 126, it will be seen that the summit of the splenic flexure has been cut by the mid-Poupart perpendicular line.0 <C ,.0 ^ a> M 1X1 122 I ft. o <^ O m TO C O e o3 .

On the right side, the internal oblique has been divided external to the linea semilunaris to expose the transversalis; while on the left the anterior portion of the sheath of the rectus has been stripped off to expose it and the pyramidalis, the oblique and transversalis muscles being cut away to expose the fascia transversalis. The pyramidalis is specially developed in those animals which possess a marsupial bone. It will be noticed that the arching fibres of the transversalis springing from Poupart'g ligament and passing inwards to join those of the internal oblique (forming the con- joined tendon), leave an oval space which is guarded only by the transversalis fascia. This space is crossed by the deep epigastric artery, and thus divided into two—(i) an external part, the internal abdominal ring; and (ii) an internal, the lower portion of Hesselbach's triangle: the latter is again crossed and strengthened by the obliterated hypogastric artery. Through the internal ring the cord or round ligament passes, and the oblique form of inguinal hernia descends when present, following the course of the cord along the inguinal canal, and issuing at the external abdominal ring. It would thus have the following coverings:—1. Peritoneum and subperitoneal tissue ; 2. In- fundibuliform process of the fascia transversalis; 3. Cremasteric fascia; 4. Inter- columnar fascia; 5. Subcutaneous tissue and skin. It must be remembered that the testicle in its descent pushes before it a process of peritoneum, the lower part of which remains as the tunica vaginalis, while the upper portion usually becomes obliterated. Should the whole of this process remain unobliterated so that the tunica vaginalis communicates with the peritoneal cavity, the bowel may have to overcome only a slight constriction at the internal ring to at once slip into the canal and descend into the tunica vaginalis, lying in front of the testis—a congenital hernia; or should the opening be so small that only the peritonejil fluid can drain into it, this fluid collects in the tunica vaginalis and forms a congenital hydrocele. Again, the tunica vaginalis may be cut off from the upper part of the process, and this process remain unobliterated : then the gut may descend into it and form a hernia into the funicular pouch of the peritoneum, or an infantile hernia. When the gut descends through the lower part of Hesselbach's triangle—the direct form—it may pass on either side of the obliterated hypogastric. If to the outer side—tha most common form between it and the deep epigastric artery—it would receive the same coverings as in the oblique form, save that it would push the main part of the fascia transversalis as a covering in front of it instead of entering the infundibuliform pro- longation of that fascia through the internal ring. The rarer form is when the gut comes through to the inner side of the obliterated hypogastric artery, and has to push before it or separate the fibres of the conjoined tendon which here strengthens the wall. It thus breaks through the wall opposite the external ring out of which it passes, and it has as coverings: 1. Peritoneum and subperitoneal tissue; 2. Fascia transversalis; 8. Conjoined tendon ; 4. Intercolumnar fascia ; 5. Skin and subcutaneous tissue. a124 I m o m C "-I ft 08 o 2 .1 o OJ 0( to <o n ft ft 3 CO ft 05 ft c3 1/3 S « lis - 1 ft =5 o .3 I—( f-H C3 03 w w CQ O a.

SUPERFICIAL VIEW OF VISCERA WITH THE ABDOMINAL PARIETES REMOVED. In the dissection here represented, the abdomen was opened by a longitudinal incision along the linea alba, and a transverse one opposite the umbilicus, taking care to preserve the falciform ligament of the liver when turning back the upper right flap. For convenience of description the abdomen is usually divided into nine regions by two horizontal lines—one drawn across the abdomen at the level of the ninth rib, and another drawn across at the level of the highest point of the iliac ci:est—and by two vertical lines which are drawn upwards perpendicularly to the middle of Poupart's ligament, striking the costal arch about the tip of the eighth rib. Professor Cunningham, in dealing with the delimitation of the regions of the abdomen, suggests that, while keeping the mid-Poupart perpendicular lines, the t\ o horizontal should be drawn at somewhat different levels than they are at present. Taking into consideration the natural division of the abdomen into (1) the part under cover of the ribs, (2) that in front of the iliac bones, and (3) the narrow portion between them devoid of skeletal support, he draws the upper or subcostal line at a level coinciding with the lowest point of the tenth costal arch—the lowest point of the fixed ribs which is situated in front of the lateral line of the trunk, and is easily ascertained. This plane passes through the upper part of the body of the third lumbar. The lower or intertubercular line passes through the level of the highest point of the iliac crest seen from the front—that is, between the prominent tubercles which exist at the upper end of the strong bars of bone running from the crest down to the acetabulum on either side. These tubercles are better marked than the anterior superior spines. The only objection to this plane is that it cuts off the upper 1} inch of the iliac fossa and gives it to the lumbar region ; it passes through the middle of the body of the fifth lumbar vertebra. The line passing through the anterior superior spines is avoided, because the plane drawn through them would cut the sacrum and thus place the upper part of the pelvis and the greater portion of the iliac fossa in the umbilical zone. The accompanying diagrams show the viscera cut in making a frozen section through the right and left mid-Poupart lines, and are copied from Professor Cunning- ham's paper.' (See next page.)

THE FOURTH VIEW OF THE ABDOMINAL VISCERA— PORTAL VEIN, PANCREAS AND SPLEEN, &c. In tliis dissection the stomach, duodenum, and transverse colon were removed, and the liver stitched to the anterior wall to display the contents of the lesser omentuir —■ viz. the common bile-duct, formed by the junction of the hepatic and cystic ducts, lying in front and to the right, the hepatic artery to the left and on a plane sUghtly posterior, the portal vein being seen behind and between the other two. The spleen has been left resting on the costo-colic ligament, a process of peritoneum which extends from the splenic flexure of the colon to the tenth and eleventh ribs. The portal vein is about three inches long, and usually commences at the upper border of the pancreas by the junction of the superior mesenteric and splenic veins. In 66 per cent, of cases the inferior mesenteric joins the splenic, and in 33 per cent, it joins the superior mesenteric, while in the remaining 1 per cent, it runs into the junction of the two veins. The ending of the inferior mesenteric vein in the splenic appears to be a feature in the higher development of animals, as in all mammalia below monkeys it opens into the superior (Treves). The portal system has no valves, and communicates with the systemic venous system at 1. The rectum (superior with middle and inferior hsemorrhoidal). 2. The oesophagus (gastric with the oesophageal). 3. Small veins of duodenum and pancreas with the left renal. 4. The superficial portal capillaries and the capillaries in the falciform ligament of the liver with the phrenic veins. 5. Along the round ligament there are often one or more small veins which form a communication with the epigastric veins, and in certain diseased states of the liver are often much dilated. They are called the parumbilical veins, ' and may represent the anterior abdominal vein or suprahepatic termination of the hypoblastic vein ' (Macalister).

This plate is taken from the same hody as the preceding. The pancreas, ascending and descending colon, sigmoid flexure, and the liver, excepting a small portion sur- rounding the vena cava, have been removed. Thus the kidneys, almost the entire length of the vena cava, and most of the branches of the abdominal aorta have been exposed. The following diagram shows the anterior relations of the kidneys, but it should be borne in mind that these necessarily alter somewhat with each individual, according to the height of the kidney above the iliac crest, and therefore can only be taken as a mean. The height of the lower edge of the kidneys above the iliac crest varies very con- sideiably, but on the whole the left is usually placed a little higher than the right.

This dissection is a continuation of same subject as in the last plate. The inferior vena cava and the remains of the liver have been removed, exposing the right splanchnic nerve, semilunar ganglion, and crus of diaphragm; the lumbar arteries are seen coming off from the aorta. The kidney, psoas parvus, and magnus have been removed on the left side to allow the lumbar plexus to be dissected out. The communications with the sympathetic are well seen. The ilio-lumbar artery is given off from the common iliac instead of the posterior trunk of the internal iliac, and this mode of origin is by no means uncommon. On the left side the body of the pubes has been removed to expose the internal iliac vessels and their branches. The following diagram shows a scheme of the lumbar plexus; the posterior divisions of the nerves have been shaded. The so-called accessory obturator would be better named ' accessory anterior crural,' (1) because in its origin it is more nearly allied to that nerve; (2) because of its course over the pubic ramus ; (3) because it supplies a portion of the pectineus muscle in place of the anterior crural.

FIRST SIDE VIEW OF A MALE PELVIS. In the dissection represented in the plate the right innominate bone was sa^ra through the body of the pubis at the inner end of the thyroid foramen in order to save the attachment of the pelvic fascia. The bone Avas then disarticulated from the sacrum, the spine of the ischium being first severed at its base, and hooked up int) position. Thus the attachments of the coccygeus and levator ani are preserved iu their normal positions. The ischio-rectal fossa was then dissected from the side, and a part of the lateral wall of the bladder cleared to show the muscular coat. The so-called white line of the pelvic fascia is not clearly shown. It extends from the spine of the ischium to the body of the pubes, and is supposed to mark the limit of origin of the levator ani; but the fibres of this muscle often separate the obturator from the recto-vesical fascia higher than this line. The plate also shows how, by distending the rectum and then inflating the bladder, the anterior non-peritoneal surface of the latter is brought into contact with the abdominal wall, and the peritoneum carried upwards. This fact is taken advantage of in doing a suprapubic lithotomy. The tissue between the bladder and posterior surface of the pubes is very lax, and can be easily broken down by the finger, leaving a cavity, the space of Eetzius. According to Braune, the transversalis fascia splits at the umbilicus, one layer following the urachus down to the bladder, and the other passing over the abdominal wall to the back of the pubes ; and it is the interval between these layers that forms the space above mentioned, and it is into this space that the bladder rises when distended. In the fcetus the bladder lies against the abdominal wall, and 'in the deficient wall of the rectal sheath we have a trace of the original situation of the viscus, the upper border of which is marked by the semilunar line of Douglas ' (Macalister). In a male child at birth the urethra enters the bladder opposite the upper border of the symphysis, and the bladder occupies the lower two-thirds of the space between umbilicus and pubes. The peritoneum extends far more to the base of the bladder than in tlie adult, and this may account for the fact that in children the main cause of death after perineal lithotomy is due to injury of this membrane.138 PLATE LXXl.

In this dissection, which is a continuation of that represented in the previous plate, the spine of the ischium has been turned down witii the coccygeus muscle, and the levator ani separated from the spine and also turned down, beiug cut away from its attachment to the pubes. The capsule of the prostate has been opened to expose the gland. Fig. II. shows a side view of the levator am muscle. The accompanying diagram has been introduced to show the reflections of the pelvic fascia. The plane of section passes from the anterior superior iliac spine through the anus. The so-called white Lne in the diagram has been shown as the point of splitting of the obtui'ator from the recto-vesical fascia, although the levator ani often by its higher origin splits the two fasciae farther up. It also shows clearly how the ischio- rectal fossa is bounded on the sides by the obturator and anal fascite. Dr. Symington,' in making frozen sections of the pelvis, has proved that the usual description of the last part of the rectum is incorrect. He finds, 1st, that the second portion of the rectum is sacculated, and not a cylinder—the valves of Houston being situated between the sacculi—and that there is a shght cul-de-sac in the rectum just as it turns down to the anus, even when empty. 2nd (Third portion).—The anus or anal passage is one inch in length, and has its lateral walls in contact save during deftecation; it is, in fact, an antero-posterior slit.

The left os innominatum was disarticulated from the sacrum and sawn through the body in front just internal to the obturator foramen ; the spine of the ischium having been first removed to preserve the coccygeus muscle. The levator ani and coccygeus muscles were then turned down, and the recto-vesical fascia partly dissected away to expose the rectum and vagina.

PLATE LXYIII. THE FOURTH VIEW OF THE ABDOMINAL VISCERA— PORTAL VEIN, PANCREAS AND SPLEEN, &c. In tliis dissection the stomach, duodenum, and transverse colon were removed, and the liver stitched to the anterior wall to display the contents of the lesser omentuir —■ viz. the common bile-duct, formed by the junction of the hepatic and cystic ducts, lying in front and to the right, the hepatic artery to the left and on a plane sUghtly posterior, the portal vein being seen behind and between the other two. The spleen has been left resting on the costo-colic ligament, a process of peritoneum which extends from the splenic flexure of the colon to the tenth and eleventh ribs. The portal vein is about three inches long, and usually commences at the upper border of the pancreas by the junction of the superior mesenteric and splenic veins. In 66 per cent, of cases the inferior mesenteric joins the splenic, and in 33 per cent, it joins the superior mesenteric, while in the remaining 1 per cent, it runs into the junction of the two veins. The ending of the inferior mesenteric vein in the splenic appears to be a feature in the higher development of animals, as in all mammalia below monkeys it opens into the superior (Treves). The portal system has no valves, and communicates with the systemic venous system at 1. The rectum (superior with middle and inferior hsemorrhoidal). 2. The oesophagus (gastric with the oesophageal). 3. Small veins of duodenum and pancreas with the left renal. 4. The superficial portal capillaries and the capillaries in the falciform ligament of the liver with the phrenic veins. 5. Along the round ligament there are often one or more small veins which form a communication with the epigastric veins, and in certain diseased states of the liver are often much dilated. They are called the parumbilical veins, ' and may represent the anterior abdominal vein or suprahepatic termination of the hypoblastic vein ' (Macalister). T

X Position of the lowest superficial lymphatic gland in upper limb. VESSELS a Median vein, b Median cephalic. c Radial vein. d Cephalic vein. c Median basiHc. / Ulnar veins, common trunk. g Posterior ulnar veins, h Anterior ulnar vein. k Communication of median with deep veins. I Basilic vein. NERVES 1 Internal cutaneous, anterior division. 2 Internal cutaneous, posterior division. 3 External cutaneous. 4 Posterior branch of external cutaneous. Upper external cutaneous branch of musculo-spiral. A twig from the internal cutaneous, supplying the skin in front of biceps. 7 Nerve of Wrisberg. It may be taken as a general rule that the external cutaneous nerve passes beneath the median cephalic vein, and that one or two branches of the internal cutaneous nerve usually pass over the median basilic, while the others pass beneath it. It is important to remember that the median basilic vein is only separated by the bicipital fascia from the brachial artery which lies beneath it; and thus, in the olden days when bleeding was the fashion, the artery was frequently injured, and arterio-venous aneurisms were not uncommon. Supra-condyloid lymphatic gland.-â€”This, the lowest lymphatic gland (or glands) in the arm, is placed about an inch above the internal condyle, along the course of the basilic vein ; it receives all tlie lymphatics from the ulnar side of the forearm and fingers, and most of those from the radial; some lymphatics from the latter, however, running up along the cephalic vein to reach the glands in the axillary space.

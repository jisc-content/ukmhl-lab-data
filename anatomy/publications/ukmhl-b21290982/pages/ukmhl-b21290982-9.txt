PEEFACE In designing these plates the author has had in his nxind the valuable assistance rendered to him in the first years of his curriculum by the magnificent plates of Professor Ellis, which, however useful they may be, are too large to be portable, and too expensive for the majority of students to obtain. In order to get over this difficulty, the plates, with the exception of five, instead of being life-size, are reducsd by one-third, thiis making a convenient and portable book; and it is hoped that the price will place these ' dissections ' within the reach of all those who care for a graphic representation of anatomy. A picture or diagram of anatomy is far more useful in fixing the position of parts than a mere written de- scription, and impresses them on the memory in such a manner, that they are easily recalled when engaged in surgical or medical work. The best illustration is the body itself, and it is here that the student must lay, hy careful dissection, a good and sound foundation of his anatomical work. The author ventures to place these plates before the student as portraying the different structures in their normal positions, which he Has to search for and display during his dissections. Thus they will serve as models and, further, will recall the work already done when revising his anatomy previous to an examination. And when, in after years, he has settled down into the staid and prosperous practitioner, the author hopes that, should any anatomical difficulty arise when there is no subject to refer to, these plates may serve to fill a gap by showing the relations of the different structures to one another, and thus recall work long since relegated to the background. The dissections only aim at showing the ordinary details which any careful worker can dissect out for himself, and not unnecessary minutiee. The various structures have been kept as closely as possible in their normal relations to each other. Finding it impossible in some of the

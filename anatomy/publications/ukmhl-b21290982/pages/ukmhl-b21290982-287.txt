PLATE LXX. POSTERIOR WALL OF ABDOMEN—LUMBAR PLEXUS. This dissection is a continuation of same subject as in the last plate. The inferior vena cava and the remains of the liver have been removed, exposing the right splanchnic nerve, semilunar ganglion, and crus of diaphragm; the lumbar arteries are seen coming off from the aorta. The kidney, psoas parvus, and magnus have been removed on the left side to allow the lumbar plexus to be dissected out. The communications with the sympathetic are well seen. The ilio-lumbar artery is given off from the common iliac instead of the posterior trunk of the internal iliac, and this mode of origin is by no means uncommon. On the left side the body of the pubes has been removed to expose the internal iliac vessels and their branches. The following diagram shows a scheme of the lumbar plexus; the posterior divisions of the nerves have been shaded. The so-called accessory obturator would be better named ' accessory anterior crural,' (1) because in its origin it is more nearly allied to that nerve; (2) because of its course over the pubic ramus ; (3) because it supplies a portion of the pectineus muscle in place of the anterior crural.

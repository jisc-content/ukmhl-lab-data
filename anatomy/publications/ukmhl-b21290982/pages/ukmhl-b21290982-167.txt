PLATE XXXIX. ANTERIOR TRIANGLE, SUPERFICIAL VIEW. In this dissection, after the skin was removed, the plafcysma was cut across, and its upper portion turned over the jaw. The cervical fascia and the superficial lymphatic glands lying in the submaxillary triangle were removed and the space cleaned of fat. The following diagram has been introduced to show a plan of the superficial veins of the neck : (a) Temporal; (b) internal maxillary; (c) posterior auricular ; (d) anterior branch of temporo-maxillary going to join the facial; (e) external jugular formed by the junction of the posterior auricular and posterior branch of the tempoio- maxillary ; (/) posterior external jugular, which usually receives the mastoid vein from the lateral sinus ; (g) placed between the transverse cervical and the supra-scapular veins ; (h) facial ; (i) submental; (k) anterior jugular ; (/) hngual; (m) superior thyroid ; Oi) middle thyroid ; (o) internal jugular ; (p) subclavian ; (r) jugulo-cephahc ; (s) deep facial which communicates with the pterygoid plexus, this plexus receives a vein through the foramen Vesalii from the cavernous sinus; (t) communication between the angular vein and the ophthalmic (which flows into the cavernous sinus).

PLATE XXXII. THE SECOND VIEW OF THE CALF, SOLEUS, PLANTARIS, AND DEEP VIEW OF THE POPLITEAL SPACE. In this plate the gastrocnemius has been removed, having been cut through near its origin and also near its junction with, the soleus to form the tendo Achillis. The aponeurosis of insertion of the sartorius has been turned forwards to show the way in which the tendons of the gracilis and semitendinosus lie on its deep aspect, being incorporated with it. The fibres of these two last muscles can be traced separately into the bone only by cutting them out of the sartorius aponeurosis, a thin layer of which comes down on their deep aspect. The lower portion of the aponeurosis is continued into the deep fascia of the leg, the fibres being traceable nearly as far as the ankle. The semitendinosus and gracilis also send slips to join the fascia. The cutaneous nerve supply of the back of the leg is shown in the annexed diagram : (a) Termination of small sciatic; (b) lower branch of internal cutaneous ; (c) cutaneous twigs from the long saphenous ; (d) cutaneous branches from external popliteal; (e) communicans peronei; (/) communi- cans tibialis (under fascia), the junction of these two (e and/) forming the short or external saphenous. Hhe plantaris muscle bears the same relation to the plantar fascia that the palmaris longus does to the palmar fascia, but it has been cut off entirely from the remainder of its tendon by the outgrowth of the heel. In most mammals this muscle supplies the perforated flexor tendons to the toes, and is far better developed than in man, where it is functionless save that it may feebly assist the action of the tendo Achillis. The tibial origin of the soleus is secondary to the fibular origin, and is only found in man and one or two of the anthropoid apes. (Macalister.)

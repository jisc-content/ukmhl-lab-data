PLATE YII. FRONT OF FOREARM, SECOND VIEW. This is a deeper view of Plate VI. from the same arm. The palmaris longus and flexor carpi radialis have been cut away to show the flexor sublimis digitorum; and the inner edge of the supinator longus pulled a little outwards in order to expose the radial artery in the whole of its course in the forearm, and also the extensor carpi radialis longior which lies beneath it.

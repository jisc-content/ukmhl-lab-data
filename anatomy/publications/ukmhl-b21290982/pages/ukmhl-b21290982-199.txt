PLATE XLVII. DEEP VIEW OF THE PTERYGOID REGION AND SIDE OF NECK, GASSERIAN GANGLION, MUSCLES OF TONGUE. This dissection is a continuation of the one in Plate XLVI.; the left side of the jaw having been completely removed to near the symphysis ; the tongue was drawn out and fastened by a stitch to the tip of the nose, while the great wing of the sphenoid was chiselled away to expose the Gasserian ganglion. The styloid process was next cut off to expose more completely the structures lying deep to it. Between the tensor and levator palati muscles is a whitish band; this is the car- tilaginous portion of the Eustachian tube, which was left unlettered from want of space. PLATE XLVII.

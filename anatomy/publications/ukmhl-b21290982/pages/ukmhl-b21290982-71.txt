PLATE XV. THE SUPERFICIAL DISSECTION OF THE BACK OF THE FOREARM. This plate shows a superficial dissection of the muscles on the hack of the forearm. The cutaneous nerves are shown in the sketch plan :—(a) External cutaneous of the musculo-spiral; {b) nerve of Wrisberg; (c) posterior branch of external cutaneous ; (d) posterior branches of internal cutaneous ; (e) dorsal branch of the ulnar ; (/) radial; (g) twigs from the digital branches of the median ; {h) twigs from the palmar digital branches of the ulnar, supplying the lateral aspect of the fingers. The diagram Plate XVII. shows more clearly the nerve-supply to dorsum of hand and fingers. Note on the Anconeics.—This muscle is usually supposed to be a segmentation of the lower part of the triceps, both on account of its nerve-supply from the musculo-spiral, and also the con- tinuity of the lower fibres of the triceps with it; but, on the other hand, in some lizards the anconeus is separate from the triceps, forming a portion of the extensor carpi ulnaris, and its nerve (a branch of the musculo-spiral) supplied also the supinator brevis, afterwards joining the posterior interosseous, and helping to supply the extensors of the fingers. In the alligator, the extensor carpi ulnaris is absent, a large anconeus doing its work, having a double nerve-supply, viz. from the musculo-spiral and posterior interosseous ; this has been noted by Luschka as occurring in man. It may be concluded, therefore, that this muscle is more allied to the extensor carpi ulnaris than the triceps, and that its nerve originally took a larger share in the supply of the muscles on the extensor aspect of the forearm.' It may also be added that the extensor carpi ulnaris arises from the fascia covering the anconeus for a short distance. » The President: Proc. Boy. Acad. Med. in Ireland, Lancet report.

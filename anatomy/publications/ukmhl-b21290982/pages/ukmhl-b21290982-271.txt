PLATE LXVL SECOND VIEW OF THE ABDOMINAL VISCERA- MESENTERY, SUPERIOR MESENfERIC ARTERIES, &c. In this view the transverse colon has been turned upwards with the omentum and fastened to the wall of the thorax. The anterior layer of mesentery was then dissected away to expose more fully the superior mesenteric vessels which lay between its folds, and the posterior layer of the transverse meso-colon also partially removed to expose the colica media artery and the lower edge of the pancreas. The morphological ending of the superior mesenteric artery is opposite the vitello- intestinal duct (Meckel's diverticulum), to which it is always directed. The following diagrams are sections of the abdomen and pelvis in the central line of the body, showing the reflections of the peritoneum, the cavity of tlie lesser sao being shaded.

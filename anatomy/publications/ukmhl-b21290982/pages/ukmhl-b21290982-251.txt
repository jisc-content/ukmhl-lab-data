PLATE LX. THE THIRD VIEW OF THE PERINEUM-PROSTATE AND VESICUL^ SEMINALES. In this view of the perineum the accelerator urinte has been divided along its central raphi and turned aside to expose the bulbous portion of the corpus spongiosum, Tiie levator ani has been severed beliind the central fixed point of the perineum, and the rectum pulled back to expose the prostate and base of bladder, with the vesicular seminales. The anterior layer of the triangular ligament was removed on the left side, to show the internal pudic artery and dorsal nerve of the penis. The following structures are contained between the two layers of the triangular ligament:— 1. Dorsal nerve of penis, and twig to the bulb. 2. Internal pudic arteries, and arteries to the bulb. 3. Plexus of veins. 4. Deep transverse muscle. 5. Cowper's glands. 6. Membranous urethra. 7. Compressor urethra. 8. Dorsal vein of penis. 9. Subpubic ligament. Thus, in the dissection of the perineum the following alternating layers have been seen and divided :— 1. Fascia of Colles, or deep layer of the superficial fascia. I Erector penis. 2. Superficial perineal muscles \ Accelerator urinae. i Transversus perinei. 3. Anterior layer of triangular ligament. 4. Compressor urethrse and deep transversus muscle. 5. Posterior layer of iiie triangular ligament. G. Levator ani. 7. Capsule of prostate.

(The long subscapular nerve may derive fibres from the 8 C, and the middle from the 7 C. The nerve to the coraco-brachialis came from the 6 C instead of the 7 C, its usual origin.) Both median and ulnar nerves send branches to the metacarpo-phalangeal and phalangeal joints uf their respective fingers. Underneath each nerve is written the numbers of the spinal nerves from which its fibrils are normally derived. Also the chief distribution to muscles, joints and skin.

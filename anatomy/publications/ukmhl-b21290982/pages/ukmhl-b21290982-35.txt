PLATE VI THE FRONT OF THE FOREARM, FIRST VIEW. This is a superficial dissection of the muscles on the front of the forearm. The bicipital fascia was left to show how it braces the muscles together, and in a muscular subject has a constricting influence upon the contour of the inner side of the forearm. The external cutaneous nerve was not cleared away with the other sub- cutaneous structures, in order to show its communication with the radial; but it must be remembered that, although it appears to lie upon the muscles, yet it is separated from them by the deep fascia of the forearm which has been removed. The accompanying sketch shows the cutaneous nerve-supply of the anterior surface of the forearm and hand : (a) Internal cutaneous ; {b) posterior branch of external cutaneous; (c) external cutaneous ; (d) palmar cutaneous of the median; (e) palmar cutaneous of the â– ulnar; (/) digital branches of the median; {h) digital branches of the ulnar. The palmaris longus is one of the most variable muscles in the body, and may be absent, being then replaced by a fibrous band which occupies the normal position of the muscle.

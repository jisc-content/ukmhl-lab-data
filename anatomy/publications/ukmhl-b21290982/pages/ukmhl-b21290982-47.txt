PLATE IX, THE PALMAR FASCIA. Tliis plate shows a superficial dissection of the lower part of the forearm, and palm of the hand. The tendon of the palmaris longus after perforating the deep fascia of the forearm is continued into the palmar fascia, which may he spoken of as an expansion of its tendon. The palmaris brevis which arises from its inner border is the remnant of the large muscular palmaris longus which exists in the armadillo, etc., and is there muscular in the whole of its extent.' The palmar fascia with the palmaris brevis is easily reflected from the underlying structures on the dinar side of the hand, but on the radial side the fascia is bound down to the annular ligament at the point where it blends with the origin of the abductor and outer head of the flexor brevis pollicis. The palmar fascia, as seen in the plate, is strong and triangular, being composed chiefly of longitudinal fibres, continuous above with those of the tendon of the palmaris longus, while below they divide into four digital slips which pass along the middle line of the finger, and are closely connected with the skin over the first phalanx. The four digital slips are tied together by transverse fibres, which are collected, opposite the metacarpo-phalangeal joint, into a well-marked bundle called the superficial transverse ligament; each slip also gives off from its deep surface two prolongations which descend on either side of the flexor tendons to be attached to the glenoid plates and edges of the metacarpal bone. An arch is thus formed through which the flexor tendons pass, while between the arches the digital nerves and arteries, and the lumbricals pass to their destination. ' It is the degenerate perforated flexor of the first phalanges.' (Macalititier.) ' For further information, see the Morphology of Ligaments by Mr. J. Eland Sutton.

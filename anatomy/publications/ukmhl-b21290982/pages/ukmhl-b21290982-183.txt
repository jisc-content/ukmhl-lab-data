PLATE XLIII. THE FACE. This dissection shows as far as pofsible the structures of the face; no attempt was made to dissect out the small muscles of the nose, but the rest of the structures are well shown. The accompanying diagram shows the cutaneous nerves of the head and neck. (a) supra-clavicular (3 + 4 C); (b) super- ficialis colli (2 + 3C); (c) great auricular (2 + 30); (d) small oc- cipital (2 C); (e) great occipital (posterior division of 2 + 3 C); (f) auriculo-temporal (3rd division of 5th); (g) temporal twig of temporo-malar (2nd division of 5th); (h) supra-orbital; (i) la- chrymal ; (k) frontal; (l) twigs from infra- trochlear loop (all from 1st division of 5th) ; (m) infra-orbital (2nd division of 5th); (n) malar branch of temporo-malar (2nd di- vision of 5th); (o) nasal nerve (1st division of 5th); (p) mental branch of inferior dental (3rd division of 5th). There was no divi- sion of the zygomatic muscle into major and minor; in fact the latter is but a slip of the major which has rsniained separate from its anterior edge. Nor is there any sepa- ration, as a rule, between the adjacent edges of the levator labii superioris and the levator labii superioris aleeque nasi, and but a faint attempt at divi- sion ; in fact the whole should be called the levator labii superioris, some of whose inner fibres get an insertion into the alae of the nose. In the chimpanzee these four muscles, the two zygomatic! and the two levators, are united to form one broad muscle which arises round the circumference of the orbit and runs down to be inserted into the upper lip.

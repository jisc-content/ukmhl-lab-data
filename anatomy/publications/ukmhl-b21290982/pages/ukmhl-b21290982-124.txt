In some cases it will be found that the small sacro-sciatic ligament is entirely or partly replaced by fibres of the coccygeus muscle, of which it appears to be a fibrous retrogression ; in the armadillo this is again replaced by bone. ' The muscle substance was very thiu in this body, and there was complete absence of the gemellus superior.

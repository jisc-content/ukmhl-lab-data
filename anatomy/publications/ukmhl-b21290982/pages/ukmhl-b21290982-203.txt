PLATE XLYIII. Natural Size. INTERIOR OF SKULL, TENTORIUM, CIRCLE OF WILLIS, FIRST VIEW OF ORBITS. In tins plate the calvarium has been removed in the usual way by a horizontal saw cut, and the brain carefully removed so as to leave intact the arteries composing the circle of Willis in their normal positions with relation to the nerves. The best way of doing this in the ordinary dissecting-room subject is to use a stream of water either from a syringe or tap and allow it to wash away the brain. On the left side the attached edge of the tentorium has been cut into to expose the lateral sinus. The orbits were then opened in the usual manner, but if the dissector wishes to preserve the pulley of the superior oblique in situ, it will be best to place the tip of a finger in the inner corner of the orbit and saw through directly external to it. The arteries comprising the circle of Willis are, the basilar behind dividing into the posterior cerebrals ; the internal carotids on either side in front giving off the anterior cerebrals, which are joined in front by a short trunk of somewhat variable size, the anterior communicating, and the middle cerebrals which are connected by means of the posterior communicating with the posterior cerebrals ; the posterior communicating are very variable in size and may not be of the same calibre on both sides of the body. Thus is established a great circle of anastomosis at the base of the brain.

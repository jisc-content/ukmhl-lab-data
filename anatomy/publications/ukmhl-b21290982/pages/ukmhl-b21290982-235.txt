PLATE LVI. THE POSTERIOR VIEW OF THORAX. In this dissection the whole of the vertebrae were removed, also the ribs as far as their angles. The body had not been dissected from the front of the thorax, so that everything is nearly in its normal position ; save that, owing to the removal of the con- necting vertebrae, the space has been elongated by the weight of the abdomen and head and neck dragging in opposite directions over the blocks on which the trunk was supported. The obliquity of the higher aortic intercostals is also well shown ; these in the early foetus come off at right angles to the aorta, and it is only after the first year of birth that the obliquity makes its appearance. The posterior mediastinum includes that portion of the interpleural space behind the pericardium and below the level of the fourth dorsal vertebra. It is bounded In front, by the pericardium ; Behind, by the bodies of the vertebrse ; and Above, by a plane passing through the joint of the manubrium and gladiolus sterni and the lower part of fourth dorsal vertebra. Beloio, by the diaphragm. Ccnients.â€”Desceniing part of aortic arch and thoracic aorta ; origin of the aortic intercostals ; azygos major, minor, and left upper azygos veins. CEsophagus and thoracic duct. Posterior mediastinal glands. Vagi and plexus gulte. Professor Macalister limits the term ' aortic arch' to the transverse portion of the aorta as the ascending portion belongs to the ventral, and the descending portion to the dorsal or thoracic aorta.

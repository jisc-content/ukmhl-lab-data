PLATE X. SUPERFICIAL PALMAR ARCH, ETC. In this dissection the palmaris brevis and the greater portion of the pahnar fascia have been removed, leaving only the outer edge of the fascia to show where it blends with the origin of the abductor poUicis, and outer head of the flexor brevis poUicis. The superficial 'palmar arch may be completed m three ways: (1) most commonly by the mosculation of the superficial branch of the ulnar with the radialis indicis of the radial; or (2) by inosculation with the superficialis vote; occa- sionally (3) by both. The position of the superficial arch may be marked on the palm, by extending the thumb and drawing a line a b from its web across the palm : this will indicate the summit of the arch. The deep palmar arch is generally about a finger's breadth higher up. (In the outline the artist has not carried the superficial arch quite low enough down.) (c) radial artery; (d) ulnar artery; (e) superficialis vote ; (/) radialis indicis. The diagram also shows in shaded lines the common arrangement of the synovial sheaths of the tendons in the palm, and it will be seen that while the sheaths of the index, middle, and ring fingers are shut off from the common synovial membrane of the flexor tendons at the wrist, about the level of the metacarpo-phalangeal joint, that of the little finger is continuous with it; the flexor tendon of the thumb has, as a rule, a sheath to itself running down under the annular ligament, but in some cases communicating with the other sheath at the wrist. Thus inflammation in the sheath of either the thumb or little finger has a clear path to spread down under the annular ligament, and may do a considerable amount of damage.

PLATE LXXII SECOND SIDE VIEW OF A MALE PELVIS. In this dissection, which is a continuation of that represented in the previous plate, the spine of the ischium has been turned down witii the coccygeus muscle, and the levator ani separated from the spine and also turned down, beiug cut away from its attachment to the pubes. The capsule of the prostate has been opened to expose the gland. Fig. II. shows a side view of the levator am muscle. The accompanying diagram has been introduced to show the reflections of the pelvic fascia. The plane of section passes from the anterior superior iliac spine through the anus. The so-called white Lne in the diagram has been shown as the point of splitting of the obtui'ator from the recto-vesical fascia, although the levator ani often by its higher origin splits the two fasciae farther up. It also shows clearly how the ischio- rectal fossa is bounded on the sides by the obturator and anal fascite. Dr. Symington,' in making frozen sections of the pelvis, has proved that the usual description of the last part of the rectum is incorrect. He finds, 1st, that the second portion of the rectum is sacculated, and not a cylinder—the valves of Houston being situated between the sacculi—and that there is a shght cul-de-sac in the rectum just as it turns down to the anus, even when empty. 2nd (Third portion).—The anus or anal passage is one inch in length, and has its lateral walls in contact save during deftecation; it is, in fact, an antero-posterior slit.

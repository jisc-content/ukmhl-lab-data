3 i898] The Teaching of Anatomy aid in the teaching of human anatomy was recognized, and during the past eight years systematic efforts have resulted in the production of an equipment which is increasing in value yearly with the further development of the Museum of Human and Comparative Anatomy. It is not our desire to debate the question whether comparative anatomy should find a place as a permanent and separate study in the medical curriculum, nor can we consider in detail the value of pre- liminary biological work to the student intending to follow medicine as a profession. We are rather brought face to face with the situation which confronts us at all our great medical centres, where annually a large number of students, differing widely in kind and degree of preliminary training, are brought together and enter at once upon the study of human anatomy. The very wealth of our knowledge here proves a source of embarrassment. The current text-books deal with a superabundance of minute detail, the smallest arterial twig and the most insignificant process of bone re- ceiving the same amount of space and attention as the more important and cardinal structures. The student is apt to find himself at a loss and over- whelmed, and it is difficult for him to follow the guiding lines in his anatomical studiesâ€”lines dealing primarily with the main structural facts of the different systems and capable of subsequent enlargement to include secondary details. The study of anatomy is, after all, the study of a mechanism, complicated and interdependent in its different parts, and adapted to perform certain functions. In teaching these facts comparison with other scientific mechanical studies may be permitted. It would universally be regarded as a faulty sys- tem, if a student of mechanical engineering were called upon at the outset of his course to consider the complicated mech- anism of a modern locomotive, or the expansion engines of an ocean steamer, before he had become familiar with the simple principles of the cylinder, piston, and boiler in struc- ture and action, or if a course in applied electricity began with the dynamo before considering the properties of the

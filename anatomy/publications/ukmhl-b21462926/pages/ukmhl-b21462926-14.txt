IO Columbia University Bulletin [June the opportunity of obtaining systematic instruction in this branch, to combine the scattered and fragmentary teaching of the different departments in a regulated course. The course should be designed with especial reference to the requirements of the medical student, and combine from the outset the study of the processes of development in the vertebrate embryo with the consideration of the clinical re- sults of the arrest of development at different stages in man. In this respect the Museum of Human and Comparative Anatomy and the Pathological Museum offer invaluable op- portunities for increasing the scope and pertinence of the in- struction. Laboratory work in practical embryology should be associated with the study of serial preparations of the lower vertebrates, presenting permanently conditions which are temporary embryonal stages in the higher forms. Com- bined with this should be the study of the congenital malfor- mations and of the pathological conditions exhibited in man as a result of arrest of development or deviation from the nor- mal type. In like manner, the clinical aspects of pregnancy, parturition, and involution should receive most important eluci- dation through the opportunities which the course would offer to study practically the normal and abnormal morphological conditions of uterus and placenta during and after gestation. The value of such a course would be great, both in the gen- eral scientific education of the medical student and for the acquisition of sound and detailed knowledge of important practical facts. When we look back over the material advances which the medical school has made as part of a great university system, fostered by a broad and liberal adminstration, and favored by the public-spirited generosity to which we owe our pres- ent magnificent equipment, it cannot be doubted that the near future will see our projected improvements accomplished facts.

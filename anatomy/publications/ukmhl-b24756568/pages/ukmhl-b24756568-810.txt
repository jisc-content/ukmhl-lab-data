DISSECTION OF THE EYE. 794 ftuterior eyeball. When viewed ou the eye in which tlie ciliary muscle is termination, gjj^.jj,(,^ appears to terminate there; but it may be seen in the other dissections to pass inwards behind the muscle, and to end in a series of projections (ciliary processes) at the back of the iris, i-fiiriiioiis of This covering is rather thiclier and stronger behind than in snrfacp, front. Its outer surface is for the most part only slightly attached to the sclerotic by delicate bands of areolar tissue, and has a floccu- lent appearance when detached ; but in front the ciliary muscle unites the two coats more firmly: on this surface may be seen small veins arranged in arches, and the ciliary arteries and nerves of innor; (fig, 289). The inner sitrface is smooth, and is lined by the thin npeninK behinil. Ciliniy jn'ocessos nrrangi!- nicnt; Fig. 28P.—View of the Front of the Choroid Coat and Iris—External SuRFACF, (Zinn). a.

Tosteriorly it is pierced by a round aperture for the ]iassage of the optic nerve ; and anteriorly it joins the iris. The ciliary processes (fig. 290, h) are solid projections on the inner surface of the choroid coat, disposed radially, and forming a circle lieneath the ciliary muscle and tlie outer margin of the iri.'s. About .seventy in number, they compri.se larger and smaller two kinds; eminence.":, the former being the more uumerons, and having a lengtli of al)out one-tenth of an inch. They increa.se in depth from wiUiout inwards; and at their inner ends they are united by transverse ridges.

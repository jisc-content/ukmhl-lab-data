While cutting through the corpus callosum, the student may observe that a thin membraniforiu structure (epeiulyma) lines its under surface.

The pia mater and velum the united teg- interpositum are removed, the tloor of the cerebrum in those positions ; and the posterior i)art is the thickest undor of all. Connected with its under surface along the middle at the fore part is the .septum lucidum or partition between the ventricles (fig. 274), and behind is the fornix. This is the chief comnii.ssural body of the halves of the cerebrum, and its fibres pass laterally into the medullary centre of the hemi- sphere, in which they radiate to the convolutions. Dissection.

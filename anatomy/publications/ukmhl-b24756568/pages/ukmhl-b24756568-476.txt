DISSECTION OF THE THORAX. 400 Base and its a short distance from the tip. The base of the ventricle is sloped, (>|iciiiii(,'s. .^ji,^ |g perforated by two apertures ; one of these, to the riglit and 1>elovv, leading into the auricle, is the right auriculo-ventricular opening ; the other, on the left and much higher, Ls the mouth of the pulmonary artery. The part of tlie cavity leading up to the jjulmonary artery is funnel-shaped, and is named the infundibulum or the cotius artcrioms. Anterioraiul The anterior wall, or the loose part of the ventricle, is comx)ara- tively thin, and forms most of the anterior surface of the ventricular posterior portion of the heart. The fosterior wall corresponds with the septum between the ventricles, and is much thicker. Probe in the infundibu- lum passing out of the pulmonary artery. Septal cusp. Fig. 169.—The Intbuior of the Right Ventricle (from the Fkokt ; THE Heart being held so that the Apbx is Lowest Down). Interior of Over the greater part of the ca\dty the surface is marked by pro- I'J'Iln.'.v'^,^- iectins muscular bands, the columnm camem ; but near the aperture on it tiier(! of the pulmonary artery the wall becomes smooth. 1 he llesliy sets'of fiosi. • f^olumns are of various sizes, and of tliree difl'erent kinds. Some coinmn.s!*'form merely a iiromineiice in the ventricle, especially ou the .«e])tum. Others are attaclied at each end, but free in the middle {trabcculcc carnece). And a third set, which are fewer in number and much the largest project into the cavity, and form rounded bundles.

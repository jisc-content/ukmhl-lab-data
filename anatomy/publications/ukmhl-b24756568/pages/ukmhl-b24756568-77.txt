When the radius is fixed, the muscle raises tliat bone towards the luuuerus, bending the ami elbow, elbow-joint. The FLEXOU CARPI RADIALIS (fig. 24, ■") takes its origin from the Uadiai conmion tendon, from the aponeurosis of the limb, and from the f]^p°I],°st intermuscular septum on each side of it. The tendon of the muscle, becoming free from fleshy fibres about the middle of the forearm, pa.sses through a groove in the trapezium, in a special sheath at the outer side of the anterior annular ligament, to be inserted mainly Triceps.

The muscle rests chiefly on the flexor sublimis digitorum ; but The muscle near the wrist it lies over the flexor longus pollicis,—a muscle of liVkir'^' the deep gi-oup. As low as the middle of the forearm the flexor carpi radialis corresponds externally with the pronator teres, and below that with the radial artery, to which its tendon is tjiken as the guide. The ulnar border is in contact at first with the palmaris ^ ridtai''^'' longus muscle, and for about two inches above the wrist with the artery, median nerve. Action.

THE HIP-JOINT. 169 Section III. THE HIP-JOINT. Dissection. The cajisiile of the hip-joiut should now be cleaned. Cut through the iliacus and psoas below Poupart's ligament, and turn them down. In doing so a large bursa will be opened which Biu-sa under facilitates the movement of these muscles over the front of the joint. Sometimes it will be found that this bursa communicates with the joint cavity through a thin part in the front of the capsule (fig. 63). The rectus femoris, the sartorius, the tensor fascire femoris, and the gluteus minimus should be cleared from the joint, and the front, outer, and inner parts of the capsule cleaned, as has already been done at the back. The intimate connection of the reflected Pnbo-femor.il ligament. Origin of lectus femoris. Tliin part of capsule, .sometimes pev- forated. Upper portion of ilio- femoral ligament. Intermediate portion of capsule, some- times thin. Lower portion of ilio-femoral liga- ment.

This articulation is a ball and socket joint, the Hip-joint, head of the femur being received into the acetabulum of the hip- bone. Connecting the bones are the following ligaments :—one to "ea- deepen the receiving cavity, which is named cotyloid; another between the articular surfaces of the bones—the inUrarticular; and a capsule around all. In the capsule itself the student has to define a wide thick part Define its in front, and a transverse baud near the neck of the femur behind, Ubres.

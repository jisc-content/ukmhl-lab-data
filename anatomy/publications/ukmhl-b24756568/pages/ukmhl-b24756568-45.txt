SCAPULAR MUSCLES. 29 Between the larger rhomboid muscle ami the serratus magnus, at the base, or vertebral border, of the scapula, run the posterior scapular artery and vein, the ramifications of which are to be traced. To the borders and the angles of the scapula the following Muscles muscles are connected:— «ttache<i From the upper margin of the scapula arises one muscle, the to uiiiicr omohyoid (fig. 11, e). About half an inch wide at its origin, the "h" scapfua, muscle is attached to the edge of the bone behind the notch, and sometimes to the ligament which bridges over the notch. Along the cuillarij maryin arise the long head of the triceps to "xiiiaiy (fig. 22, A, p. .'iCL), and tlie teres minor (h) and major (g) muscles ; Trapezius. Deltoi Supraspinatus. Biceps (sliorL head) and coraco-brachialis. Pecloralis minor. Glenoid ligament. Triceps (long head). Fig. 10.—The Scapula from the Front. but these attachments will be ascertained in the progress of the dissection. The vertebral border of the bone has four muscles inserted into it. and to base • Between the superior angle and tlie spine is the levator anguli scapulfe (figs. 12 and 13, h) ; opposite the spine the rhomboideus minor (j) is attached ; and between the spine and the inferior angle the rhomboideus major (k) is inserted : the upper fibres of the last muscle often end in an aponeurotic arch, which is fixed to the Ijoue above and below. In front of these muscles, and inserted into the base of the scapula along its whole length, is the serratus magnus muscle (figs. 10 and 11, d), the upper and lower parts of which are much thickened, and occupy special surfaces on the ventral aspect of the corresponding angles of the bone.

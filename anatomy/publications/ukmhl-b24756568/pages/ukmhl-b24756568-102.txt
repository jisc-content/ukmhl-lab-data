DISSECTION OF THE BACK OF THE FOREARM. 86 on elbow The digits being straightened, it will jtssist the other muscles in and wrist, extending the wrist and the elbow. Extensor of The EXTENSOR MINIMI DIGITI (e) is the niost slender muscle on little Hnger: ^hg back of the forearm, and ajDpears to be but a part of the common oriRin; extensor. Its origin is in common with that of the extensor com- munis, but it passes through a distinct sheath of the annular liga- tfii-raination; nient. Beyond the ligament the tendon splits into two, and the outer part is joined by the fourth tendon of the common extensor : Knally, both parts enter the common expansion on the first phalanx of the little finger.

As the inner piece of the split tendon is not united 1 j with the common extensor, it can straighten the digit during flexion 1 \ of the other fingers. Extensor The EXTENSOR CARPi' ULNARIS MUSCLE (f) arises from the com- carpi ulna- ^^^^ tendon, the aponeurosis of the forearm, and an intermuscular septum on its outer side ; it is also fixed by fa.scia to the middle third of the posterior liorder of the ulna below the anconeus oriRin; muscle (fig. 36). Its tendon becomes free from Heshy filires near the annular ligament, and passes through a separate sheath in that insertion ; structure to be ivscried into the tuberosity at the base of the metacarpal bone of the little finger.

277 SPERMATIC CORD. Tlie round ligament, or the suspensory cord of the uterus, occupies i;i^fe;jnj'i;_ the inguinal canal in the female, and ends in the integuments ot the ,„entisrn groin." Its coverings are similar to those of the spermatic cord pl««^ of the male except that it wants the cremaster. THE SPERMATIC CORD AND THE TESTIS. Dissection. The constituents of the cord will now be displayed by Dissection, cutting them through longitudinally, as far as the scrotum, and turn- ing aside the different surrounding layers, and removing the areolar tissue. The dissector should trace branches of the genito-crural nerve and deep epigastric artery into the cremasteric covering, and note the passage of the spermatic vessels between the abdomen and the cord at the internal abdominal ring, and define the vas clcfGrBTis. Vessels and nerves of the cord. In the cord are collected together Constiti.-^ the spermatic artery and veins, which convey the blood to and from ^ord. the testicle, the nerves and lymphatics of the testicle, and the vas deferens or the efferent duct. In the female ft branch from the ovarian artery enters the round J^^^^^^^^"" ligament. The vas deferens reaches from the testicle to the urethra, and is Vas^'}^''^- placed behind the other constituents of the cord ; it will be recog- nised by its resemblance in feel to a piece of whipcord, when it is taken between the finger and the thumb. As it enters the abdomen situ-ation through the opening in the transversalis fascia (internal ring), it lies and course, on the inner side of the vessels of the testicle, and, at the same place, winds behind the epigastric artery. A small artery {the artery of the vas) will be seen running along it. It is derived either from the superior or inferior vesical arteries. Cremasteric artery and nerve. The cremasteric covering of the cord j^^^'^'^^j-^.jml^ has a separate artery and nerve. The artery is derived from the coverings of deep epigastric, and is distributed to the coverings of the cord. The <^°''^ • genital branch of the genito-crural nerve enters the cord by the internal abdominal ring, and ends in the cremaster muscle. Cutaneous vessels and nerves are supplied to the integuments '^^ij^™'*' covering the cord from the .superficial external pudic artery and the ilio-inguinal nerve. Dissection. The spermatic cord and all its coverings should now be cut through at the external abdominal ring and, with the right lialf of the scrotum and the enclosed testis, removed for examina- tion. The parts should be pinned out on a leaded piece of cork and dissected under water; the different layers being divided by a longitudinal incision and pinned out laterally as they are reflected. In the meantime the anterior abdominal wall should be carefully covered with cloths soaked in preservative. The TESTICLES (testes) are the glandular organs for the secretion of "^^^^^^^ .^^ the semen. Each is suspended in the scrotum by the spermatic cord scrotum, and its coverings, but the left is usually lower than the right ; and

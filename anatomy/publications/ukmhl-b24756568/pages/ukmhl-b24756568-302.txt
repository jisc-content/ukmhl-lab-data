DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN. 286 tlie abdominal wall Ijetween the epigastric arterj' and the edf{e of Two kinds: the rectus muscle. These two kinds of hernia are distinguished by the names external and internal, from their position to the deep external or epigastric artery ; or they are called oblique and direct, from the ° '"i"'-'^ direction they take through the abdominal wall. Thus, the hernia protruding through the internal abdominal ring with the cord is called external from being outside the artery, and oblique from its slanting course ; while the hernia between the edge of the rectus Posterior layer of sheath of rectus.

Inguinal canal : and the deep epigastric artery is named internal from being inside the artery, and direct from its straight course. External or Oblique Inguinal Hernia leaves the cavity of the abdomen with the spermatic cord, and traversing the inguinal canal, makes its exit from that passage by the external abdominal ring. Anatomy of external hernia. To understand the anatomy of this form of hernia, it will be necessary to study the passage which it occupies in its course through the abdominal wall (inguinal cjinal), the apertures by which it enters and leaves the wall (abdominal rings), and the coverings it receives in its progress. The inguinal canal (figs. 105 and 106) is the interval between the flat muscles of the abdominal wall, which contains the spermatic cord in the male, and the round ligament of the uterus in the female.

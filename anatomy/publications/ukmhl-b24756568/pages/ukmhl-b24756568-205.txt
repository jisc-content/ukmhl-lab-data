SUPERFICIAL GROUP OF MUSCLES. 189 relations : luuseles, gastrocnenuus, soleus, aud plantaris, which extend the ankle. The first two are large, giving rise to the prominence on the surface, and end below by a common tendon; but the last is inconsiderable in size, and chiefly tendinous. The GASTROCNEMIUS (fig. 71, a), the most superficial muscle, has two distinct pieces or heads, which arise from the lower end of the femur (fig. 61, p. 158). The inner lieacl of origin is attached by a large tendon to an impression at the upper aspect of the inner condyle, behind the insertion of the adductor magnus; and by short tendinous fibres to the line above the condyle. The outer head is attached by tendon to a int on the outer surface of the corre- sponding condyle, above the attach- ment of the popliteus muscle, and to the posterior surface of the bone immediately above the condyle. The fleshy fibres of the two heads are united along the middle line by a narrow thin aponeurosis, and termi- nate below with the soleus in the common tendon of insertion. One surface is covered by the fascia. The other is in contact with the soleus and plantaris, and with the popliteal vessels and the internal popliteal nerve. The heads, by which the muscle arises, assist to form the lateral boundaries of the popliteal space, and are crossed by the tendons of the hamstrings. The inner head is larger, and descends lower than the Gastrocne- miu.s: Fia. 72.â€”Second View Muscles : A. Gastrocnemius, cut. B. Soleus. c. Plantaris. D. Semimembranosus. E. Semitendinosua. F.

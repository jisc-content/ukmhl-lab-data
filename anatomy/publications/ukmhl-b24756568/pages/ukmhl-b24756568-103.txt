DEEP MUSCLES. 87 Beneath this extensor are some of the muscles of the deep layer, relations; with part of the ulna. On the outer side is the extensor of the little linger, with the posterior interpssp.nna vea.sels. Action. The ulnar extensor straightens the wrist, and inclines the nnd use. hand towards the ulnar side : it can then extend the elbow-joint. The ANCONEns (g) is a small triangular muscle near the elbow. Anconeus It arms from the outer condyle of the humerus by a tendon distinct origin; from, and nri 'f1i?-rrtn7rr-HT7^Trnrthe common tendon of the foregoing muscles. From this origin the fibres diverge to their insertion into insertion ; the outer side of the olecranon, and into the impre.ssion on the upper third of the posterior surface of the ulna (fig. .36). The upper fibres are nearly transverse, and are contiguous to the touches the lowest of the triceps muscle. Beneath the anconeus lie the supinator '''"'''P^: brevis muscle, imd_ tlie-mterpasaous recurrent vessels. Action. It assists the triceps in extending the elbow. "se. Dissection, (fig. 37). For the display of the deep muscles of Dissection tlie back of the forearm, and of the posterior interosseous vessels and of mu'rciesr nerve, three of the superficial muscles, viz., extensor communis digitorum, extensor minimi digiti, and extensor carpi ulnaris, are to be di\dded above and turned aside ; and tlie small branches of the nerve and artery entering these muscles may be cut. The loose tissue and fat are then to lie removed from the muscles, and from the ramifications of the artery and nerve ; and a slender and interos- part of the nerve, which sinks beneath the extensor of the second f^J'nprve^ phalanx of the thumb about the middle of the forearm, should be \ i traced beyond the wrist.^>V/^.'s Tlw^'V oJl aafT'^W <pniftc/\ f-^ The deep muscles sliould be carefully separated, since the outer two of the thumb are not always very distinct from each other. Deep Layer of Mu.scIjES (fig. 37). In this layer there are five J|^'™^j^^ muscles, viz., one supinator of the Ibrearm, and four special extensor the deep muscles of the thumb and index finger. The highest muscle, partly '"^y"''- surrounding the upper third of the radius, is the supinator brevis (d). Below this arc the three muscles of the thumb in the following order :—the extensor of the metacarpal bone (e), the extensor of the first (f), and that of the second phalanx (g). On the ulna the indicator muscle (h) is placed. The EXTENSOR OSSIS IIETACARPI POLLICIS (E, fig. 37, also Extensor fig. 3G) is the largest and highest of the extensor muscles of ni^t^carpi the thumb, and is sometimes united with the supinator brevis. It pollicis: arises from the posterior surface of the radius in its middle third, origin: below the supinator brevis, from a special narrow impression on the itlna, occupying the upper third of the outer division of the posterior surface, and from the intervening interosseous membrane. The tendon is directed outwards over the radial extensors of the wrist, and through the annular ligament, to be inserted into the insertion; base of the metacarpal bone of the thumb, and by a slip into the trapezium : another slip is frequently continued to the abductor poUicis. The muscle is concealed at first by the common extensor of the muscle the fingers ; but it becomes superficial in the lower third of the '^^^^^ "^^^^

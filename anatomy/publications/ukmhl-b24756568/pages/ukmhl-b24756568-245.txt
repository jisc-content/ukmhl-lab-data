AETICULATION OF THE CUNEIFORM BONES. 229 and froni their synovial cavity offsets are sent forwards between the "'t^" 'ZZncalar and cuboid hones there is an f^i-^^'sal tuee^^ baud of fibres (fig. 87, h) ; a transverse idantar band fig. 89, rt) which is concealed by the tendon of the tib.aUs postR.us ; and a stron'^ interosseous ligament. , . , i ■ , ' When the bones touch, the surfaces are tipped with car ilage, and «ynovai a process of the naviculo-cuneiform synovial cavity extends between "'articulation^ of the cuneiform bone.. These bones are uni.^^^^^^^^ united to one another by cross bands ; and the external one articu- . lates with the cuboid after a similar manner. , , , The three cuneiform hones are connected together by short trans- onew.th verse dorsal bands (fig. 87, n) between the upper surfaces, and mter- osseous ligammts between the rough parts of the contiguous sides ot the bones. Laterally there are articular sv^rfaces between the Ijones, with oflsets of the common synovial cavity. • Where the external cuneiform touches the cuboid bone, the sur- <^^:^;^.^^ faces are covered with cartilage. A dorsal ligament (fig. 8,, n) bone: passes transversely between the two ; and a plantar ligament (fig. 89, (j) takes a similar direction. Between the liones there is also an interosseous ligament. .... Tliis joint is furnished either with a distinct synovial sni', or with Nynovmi a prolongation of the common synovial cavity. _ The synovial cavUy of the articulations of the cuneiform Ijones is Comnvon .•ommon to many of the bones of the tarsus. Placed between the sac navicular and the three cuneiforms, it sends one prolongation for- wards betNveen the inner and middle cuneiform to the joints with the second and third metatarsal bones, another between the middle and outer cuneiform bones, a tliird outwards to the articulation of the navicular with the cuboid bone (when present), and sometnnes a fourth to the joint between tlie external cuneiform and the cuboid. Articular surfaces. On the navicular are three articular facets, .Surfaces of the inner being rounded, and the other two Hattened. The three cuneiforms unite in a shallow elliptical hollow, which is most excavated internallv. Movement. The cuneiform bones glide up and out on the navicular ^^^^J^ in inversion of the foot, and down and in in eversion ; and the inner ,i,„i e;er- one moves more than tlie others in consec|uence of the shape of the • articular surfaces, and the attachment to it of the tibialis anticus. . When the bones pass down the dorsal ligaments are made tight: and as they rise the interoaseous bands will keep them united. In standing these bones are separated .somewhat from each other llj!;!;!™'^^;" with diminution of the arch of the foot, and strelching of the trans- verse ligaments which connect them. Articulation of the metatarsal bones. Tlie bases of the four outer metatarsal bones are connected together by dorsal, plantar, tarsus by and interosseous ligaments ; and where their lateral parts touch, they are covered with cartilage, and have offsets of a synovial sac. The dorsal ligaments (fig. 90) are small transverse bands from 'lorsai.

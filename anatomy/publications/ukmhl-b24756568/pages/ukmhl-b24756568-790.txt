In this region they are reinforced liy tlie superior peduncles of the cerebellum, and by fibres derived from the cor])ora quadrigemina, as well as Ijy others springing from tlie grey nuclei of the crura. Fibres of Tlie fibres of the crusta enter the internal capsule ; and while some crustii, (including tbe pyramidal tract) are coutinued without interruption tlirough this into the niedidlary centi'e of the bemisphere, others pass into the lenticular and caudate nuclei, and fresh fil)re8 are and of added from those bodies.

Dis.sectioii Dissection. A complete systematic view of the ascending fibres of them cannot now be obtained on the imperfect brain. At this stage the chief purpose is to show the pa.ssage of the radiating fibres from the cms through the large cerebral ganglia, in tlie corpus To trace the ascending fibres through the corpus striatum, the .striatum. ca^idats nucleus of this body should be scraped away (fig. 282); and the dissection should be made on the lelt side, on which the striate Ijody and the oplic thalamus remain uncut. In this pro- ceeding the internal capsule comes into view, consisting of white fibres with intervening grey matter of the corpus striatum, gi\ ing the appearance of the teeth of a comb (pecten of Reil). On taking away completely the hinder part of the caudate nucleus, others of the same set of til.ires will lie seen issuing from the outer side of the optic thalamus, and radiating to the posterior and inferior portions of the hemisphere. Ascending Arranqeweiit of the ascending fibres. The fibres of the internal out hi'^'""^ capsule diverge as they pass through the grey matter of the corpus hemisphere, striatum, and at the outer margin of that body they enter the medullary centre of the hemisphere, where they decussate with the transverse fibres of the corpus callosum, and radiate to all parts of the liemisphere. The ascending fibres thus form in the hemisphere formin.' a part of a hollow cone, named the corona radiata, the apex of corona" ^^^^^^^^i is towards the crus cerebri, and the concavity turned down- wards. The base of the cone is at the surface of the hemisphere, where the fibres pass into the grey cortex of the convolutions. From the foregoing description it will be evident that the fibres constituting the corona radiata are of two kinds viz., those extend- in.' without interruption from the cortex to the crus cerebri, and tliose uniting tbe cortex with the corpus striatum and optic thalannis. Transverse The tramvcrsc or commissural fibres connect the hemispheres of the cerebrum across the median plane. They give rise to tlie great commissure of the corpus callosum, and to the anterior commissure. Tliese bodies have already been examined. ,„.,«itu. Lo„!,itudinal ov collateral fibres.

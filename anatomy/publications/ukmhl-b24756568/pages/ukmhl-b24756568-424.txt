Tlie longitudinal fibres, placed cbieliy on the sides of the vesiculjB, are continued forwards with the common seminal ducts to the urethra CRov Med. Chir. Trans. 1856.) ' ^' The mucous viembrane is thrown into ridges by the bending of the tube, and presents an alveolar or honeycomb appearance ; it is provided with tubular glands, as in the vas deferens.

Opposite the vesicula the vas deferens is enlarged, and is rather sacculated like the contiguous vesicle ; but before it joins the tube of that body to form the common .seminal duct, it diminishes in size, and becomes straight. In the mucous lining are numerous tubular glands (Henle). Common ejaculutory duds (Kg. 151, g, and fig. 153, /, p. 412). These tubes (right and left) are formed by the junction of the narrowed part or duct of the vesicula seminalis with the vas deferens of the same side. They begin opposite the lifise of the prostate, and are directed downwards and forwards through an aperture in the transverse prostatic fibres, and along the sides of the uterus masculinus

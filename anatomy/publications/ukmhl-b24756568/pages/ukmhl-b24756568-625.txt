609 DISSECTION OF THE PTBRYGOIU RKGION. Dissection. For the display of tlie pterygoid i.uiscles (tig. 218), 'rodM it will be necessary to remove a pieoe of the ramus of the jaw. ,„„scle8, But the greater part of the temporal muscle is to he lirst detached from the subjacent bone with the handle of the scalpel, and the deep temporal \-essels and nerves are to be sought in its fibres.

After the loose piece of bone has been removed, and the sub- t^^i^j" jacent parts freed from fat, the pterygoid muscles will appear, — the external {■) being directed backwards and outward.s to the condyle, while the internal ("), which is somewhat parallel in dii-ec- tion to the masseter, descends to the angle of the jaw. In removing the abundant fatty tissue, the student must be careful not to take away the thin internal lateral ligament, which lies on the internal pterygoid muscle beneath the ramus.

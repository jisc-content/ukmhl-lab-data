On tlie inner surface, towards the lower part, is a lon^ri- tudinal ridge both in front and behind, named columm oftlie vagina Before tlie tissue of the vagina has been distended, otlier transverse ridges or rugse pass between the columns. The wall of the vagina IS thicker in front round the uretlira than at any other part of the canal. Structure. The vaginal wall has a muscular coat, composed of un- striped fibres both longitudinal and circular, which is thin above, and increases in thickness below. It is lined internally by mucous membrane, and covered externally by a layer of connective ti.ssue containing a dense network of veins. The prominence of the columns is mainly due to a coUection of vascular cavernous tissue between the mucous and muscular layers. The mucous membrane is continued through the lower aperture to join the integument on the labia majora, and through the os uteri, at the opposite end, to the interior of the uterus. Many mucous glands open on the surface, especially at the upper part. Blood-vessels and nerves. The arteries are derived from the vaginal and uterine branches of the internal iliac. The veim form a pfexus around the vagina, as well as in the genital organs, and open into the internal iliac vein. The nerves are derived from the pehdc plexuses, as described on page 404. ^ The hjmphatics accompany the blood-vessels to the glands by the side of the internal iliac artery.

Its weight varies from an ounce to an ounce and a half.

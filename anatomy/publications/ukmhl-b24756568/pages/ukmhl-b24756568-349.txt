333 CffiLIAC ARTERY AND BRANCHES. The right gastro-epiploi'c artery (fig. 124 h) is the continuation of the stomach, gastro-duodenal trunk, and runs from right to left along the great curvature of the stomach. It gives offsets upwards to the surface of the stomach, and downwards to the great omentum, and ends by inosculating with the left gastro-epiploic artery. The superior pancreatico-duodenal artery (i) is of small size, and diiociemmi descends between the duodenum and pancreas to join the inferior pancreas, pancreatico-duodenal branch of the sujoerior mesenteric. Ofl'sets are given to both the viscera ; and on their posterior aspect is another Fia. 124.—View op the C(eliao Axis, and op the Visceua to WHICH ITS Branches are supplied (Tiedemann). A. Liver. B.

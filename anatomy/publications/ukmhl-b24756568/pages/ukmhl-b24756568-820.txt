DTS.SRCTION OF THK EAR. 804 inner end. attachment to the cartilage of the pinna. The inner end i.s .smaller, and is marked in the dry bone, e.\ce])t at the upper part where there is a notch in the osseous margin, hy a groove for the insertion of the membrane of the tympanum ; it is so sloped that the anterior * wall and the floor extend inwards beyond the hinder wall and the roof for nearly a quarter of an inch. Condition in In the fostus the osseous part of the meatus is very imperfect, the fcetus. ^^^^ ^^^^ anterior wall being composed of fibrous tissue. After birth the osseous wall is completed by an outgrowth from the ring (tympanic bone) which supports the membrana tympani. Fio. 295.—Veutical Section of tue Meatus Aoditorics and Tympanum (Scarpa). a. Cartilaginous part of the meatus. 6. Osseous portion. c. Membrana tympani. d. Cavity of the tympanum. e. Eustachian tube. Lining of the meatus. A prolongation of the integument lines the auditory pa.ssage, and is united more closely to the osseous than to the cartilaginous portion ; it is continued over the membrane ot the tympnnum in the form of a thin pellicle. At the entrance of the meatus are a few hairs. In the subcutaneous tissue over the Ceruminou. cartilage of the meatus lie some ceruminous glands of a yellow- s'^'""- brown colour, resembling in form and arrangement the sweat-glands of the skin ; these secrete the ear-wax, and open on the surface by separate orifices ; they are absent in the osseous jiart, and are most abundant in that small portion of the tube which is formed by fibrous tissue. . . ■ e Vessels and nerves. The meatus receives ite aHencs from the posterior auricular, the internal maxillary, and the superhcml Lining membrane of the skin Vassels.

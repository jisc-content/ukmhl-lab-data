294 DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN. Ci'ural ving size and boTindaries by the vessels, for n space (crural canal) exists on the inner side of the vein, through which the intestine descends in femoral hernia. The aperture leading into the crural canal is called the crural ring. The crural ring (fig. 107) is an interval at the base of the sheath, to the inner side of the femoral vein, and is about half an inch wide, being filled liy a lymj^hatic gland. Bounding it internally ai-e Gimbernat's ligament and the conjoined tendon ; and limiting it externally is the femoral vein (6). In front is Pouijart's ligament, with the deep crural arch ; and beliind is the pubis, covered by the pectineus muscle and the pubic portion of the fascia lata. Crossing the front of the space, but at some little distance from it, is the spermatic cord in the male, and the round Gimbernat's ligament.

Two of tlie boundaries, anterior and inner, are firm and sharp- edged, though their c(mdition varies with the position of the limb ; for if the thigh is raised and ajiproximated to its fellow, those bounding parts will be relaxed.

In front is a small branch (pubic) from the epigastric artery to the back of the pubis ; and the vessels of the spermatic cord may be said to be i)laced along the anterior aspect of the ring.

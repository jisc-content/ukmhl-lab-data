65 ULNAR ARTERY. Veins. Two vein.s ac- comiiany tlie artery, and are united across it at intervals. Nerves. The median nerve Q-) lies to the inner side of the vessel for aljont an inch, but then crosses over it to gain the outer side, the cnronoid head of the pronator teres being placed between the two. Rather above the middle of the forearm the ulnar nerve reaches the artery, and continues thence on the inner side ; and a small branch (»), sending twigs arouiul the arteiy, courses on it to the palm of the hand. On the annular liga- ment the artery has passed through the fascia, and lies close to the pisiform bone. The idnar nerve, with its palmar branch, still accompanies the ves- sel on the inner side. Branches. The greater number of the ofl'sets of the artery are distributed to the muscles. Its named branches are the follow- ing :— a. The anterior ulnar recurrent branch fre- Fio. 26.—Dissection of the Deep THE Vessels and Nerves bet (Illustrations of Dissections). Muscles: Pronator teres. Flexor longus pollicis.

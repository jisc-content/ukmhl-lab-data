DISSECTION OF THE BRAIN. 776 Preparo cerebellum. Parts to be separated Section V. THE CEKEBELLUM. Dissection. The cerebellum is to be separated from the remains of the cerebrum by carrying the knife through tlie optic thalamus, so that the small brain, the corpora quadrigemina, the crura cerebri, the pons, and the medulla oblongata may remain imited together. Any remaining pia mater is to be carefully removed from the Pons. Oulmen. Teguieula cut. Lobus centralis. Declive Post ceutral sulcus. Pre-clival sulcus. Post- , clival / sulcus. from one another.

Tlie chief sulci are represented by thick lines. median groove ou the under surface ; and the differeut bodies in that hollow are to be separated from one another. Lastly, the handle of the scalpel should be passed along a deep sulcus (the horizontal fissure) at the circumference of the cerebellum, between the upper and under surfaces. The CEREBELLUJI or small brain (figs. 284 and 285) is oval in sliape, and flattened from above down. Its longest diameter, which is directed transversely, measures about four inches. This part of the encephalon is situate in the posterior fossa of the base of the skull, beneath the tentorium cerebelli. Like the cerebrum, it is incompletely divided into two hemispheres ; the division being marked by a wide median groove along the under surface, and by a notch at the posterior border into which the falx cerebelli pro- jects. The narrower part along the middle line uniting the two hemispheres is known as the worm (vermis).

In ;-r|«t o,, front of the crest is a circular depression, fovea hemisplierica (a), ^itii fossa' which is pierced hy minute apertures for nerves and vessels, and f™"'. corresponds with the bottom of the internal auditory meatus. Behind the crest of bone, near the common opening of two of the semicircular canals, is the aperture of the aqueduct of the vestibule (c), and ai|iii>- a narrow canal which ends on the posterior surface of the petrous ''"cii"''""' portion of the temporal bone : it contains a process of the mem- branous labyrinth called the ductus endolyin.pliaticus, and a small vein.

These small canals will be brought into view bv preparation the removal of the surrounding bone! by means of a file or bone " ' forceps. Two may be seen opening near the aperture made in the vestibule, and may be followed thence ; but the third is altogether towards the posterior aspect of the petrous portion of the temporal bone. The canals are unequal in length, and each forms more than half'ont'th; an ellipse. They communicate at each end with the vestibule, but

268 DISSECTION OF THE PERINEUM. Triangular ligament. To see deep muscle. Deep transverse muscle. The TRIANGULAR LIGAMENT transmits the urethra, hut is not so strongly marked as in the male (see p. 248) ; it is interrupted to a large extent in the middle line by the apertui-e of the vagina. Dissection. By cutting througli the superficial layer''of the liga- ment in the same way as in the male (p. 249), the deep muscle, with the pudic vessels and their branches, and the dorsal nerve of the clitoris, will be arrived at. The TRANSVERSDS PERiNEi PHOFDNDUS is the representative of the constrictor urethras of the male (p. 249). It arises on each side from the pubic and ischial rami; and the fibres are directed inwards to be inserted mainly into the side of the vagina. The hindmost ones join Fio. 96.â€”The Clitoris. a.

Glands of Bartholin : shape and size; duct. the central point of the perineum ; and anteriorly some are con- tinued across from side to side in front of the urethra. Beneath the last is a circular layer of involuntary fibres, as in the other sex. Glands of Bartholin. At the hinder part of the entrance to the vagina on each side is a yellowish glandular body, whieli corresponds to Cowper's gland in the male (p. 250). It lias the sliape and size generaUy of a small bean, its greatest length, which is directed from before backwards, measuring about half an inch. It lies close to the hinder end of tlie bulb of the vestibule, and is covered by the fibres of the sphincter vagiufG. The duct is directed forwards and down- wards lor about three-quarters of an inch, to open on the inner aspect of the nynipha of the .same side, immediately below the hymen or its remains.

32 DISSECTION OP THE UPPER LIMB, and from the outer half or third of the front of the clavicle (fig. 5). Its ftlu'cs converge to a tendon which is inserted into the rough triangular impression on the outer surface of the humerus, aliove the middle (tig. 17, p. 44). Wi/I\ The anterior border is contiguou.s/TO the pectoralis major muscle ; and the ]3osterior rests on the infraspinatus, teres, and triceps muscles. The origin of the niuscle from the l)ones of the shoulder corresponds with the insertion of the trapezius. At its in.sertion the tendon of the deltoid is united with that of the pectoralis major ; and a fasciculus of the brachialis anticus is attached to the humerus on each side of it. The middle or acromial portion of the deltoid is thicker than the rest, and its filjres form large bundles which run obliquely Short head of biceps and coraco-brachiali.s. Rhomboideus mnior.

The anterior or clavicular and posterior or spimxis portions are somewhat separate from the foregoing, and their fibres converge to the anterior and posterior edges respectively of the lower tendon. which lla^■e Action.

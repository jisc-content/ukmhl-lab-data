This Vein lies near the middle line of the neck, and its size is dependent upon the degree of develop- ment of the external jugular. Beginning in some small branche.s l)eIow the chm, the vein descends to the sternum, and then bends outwards beneath the sterno-niastoid muscle, to open into the external jugular, or into the subclavian vein.' In the neck the joins anterior and external jugular veins communicate. There are two Jugular. anterior jugular vein.s, one for each side, though one is u.sually larger than the other ; and at the bottom of the neck they are joined by a transverse branch (tig. 171, p. 467). In many sulijects the lower jjart of the anterior jugular ^'ein is joined Ly a considerable branch which runs downwards, along the anterior border of the sterno-mastoid muscle, from the facial vein. masTokl a ^^^^ STERNO-CLEIDO-MASTOID MUSCLE (tig. 211,') forms the SUpei- muscie fi'-'ial prominence of the side of the neck. It is narrower in the centre than at the ends, and arises below by two heads of origin oriai.''ai ''^'^"^^ '■'^''^ separated by an elongated inten-al. The inner,°or stenuiijianri eternal, head is fixed by a narrow tendon to the anterior surface of cia;icie, the first^ piece of the sternum ; and the outer, or clavicular, has a wide fleshy attachment to the inner third of the clavicle. From this origin the heads are directed upwards, the sternal 2)ass- ing backwards, and the clavicular almost \-ertically, and join about tionar"'^' "'iddle of the neck in a flattened belly. Near the skull the skull: muscle ends in a broad tendon, which is inserted into the mastoid process at its outer aapect from tip to base, and by a thin aponeu- rosis into a rough surface behind that jnocess, and into the outer part of the upper curved line of the occipital bone, position to The muscle divides the lateral surface of the neck into the other i«rts; two main triangular spaces. On its cutaiK-ous a.spect it is covered by the integuments, the platysma, and the dee]) fascia, and is crossed by the external jugular vein, and by the great

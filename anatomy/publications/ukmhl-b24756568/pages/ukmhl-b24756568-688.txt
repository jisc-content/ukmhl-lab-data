672 DISSECTION OF THE NOSE. Respiratory region. Olfactory region. the vestibule lias the character.^ of the outer skin, being furnished with papillffi and hairs (vibrissse), and lined by a stratified scaly epithelium. The respiratorij region is the part below the level of the middle turbinate bone. Its mucous membrane is thick, of a red colour, very vascular, and has numerous mucous glands, the openings of which are readily seen on the surface. The glands are largest and most abundant on the inferior turbinate bone, and at the lower and back part of the cavity. The epithelium of this region is columnar and ciliated. The olfactory region is the narrowed upper part of the nasal fossa, which is enclosed by the ethmoid bone. It comprises the part of the Fig. 238.—Neeves of the Septum of the Nosb. 1 Olfactory bulb and inner set of 3. Naso - palatine nerve from olfactory nerves. Meckel's ganglion (too large in the 2. Nasal nerve nf the ophthalmic figure), trunk. roof formed bv the cribriform plate, the part of the septum (about one-third) formed by the perpendicular plate of tlie ethmoid, ami, on the outer wall, the upper and middle turbinate bones, together with the flat surface of the lateral mass of the ethmoid in front ol tlie former. Over this region the olfactory nerves are distributed, d it is, therefore, the seat of the sen,«e of smell. The olfactory mucous membrane is thinner, softer, and le.ss va.scular than that in the respiratory region, and it has in the fresh state a yellowish colour. Its epithelium is .•olnmnar, but not ciliated ; and il is thickly beset with siiuide tubular glands. , , j In the sinuses the mucous lining is thin and pale, and its glands MUCOUK irZu™"" fire few and small.

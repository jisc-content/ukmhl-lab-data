44 DISSECTION OF THE ARM. origin from scapiila. The short head ia the innermost, and urises from the the scapula; |.jp q£ (.j^g coracoid process in common with the coraco-brachialis miiscle (fig. 10, p. 29) ; and the longhead is attached just above the glenoid fossa of the scapuhi, within the capsule of the .shoulder-joint and is connecte(l with the glenoid ligament on either side of the fo.s8a. Muscular fibres spring from each tendinous head, and meet to form a fleshy belly, which is somewhat flattened from before back. Inferiorly the biceps ends in a tendon, which is inseHed into the tuberosity of the radius (fig. 25, p. 61), having previously given ofl' a slip to the fascia in front of the elbow. insertion into radiu.s Hupraspinatus. Pectoralis major. Supinator longus. Ext. carpi radialis longior. Common origin of extensors. Inner head of triceps. Coraco hrachialis. Pronator teres. Common origin of llexors. Fio. 17.—This Hdmerds from thk Front. parts The muscle is superficial except at the extremities. At the covering upper part it is concealed by the pectoralis major and deltoid muscles ; and at tlie lower end the tendon dips into the hollow in and beneath front of tlie elbow. Beneath the biceps are the musculo-cutaneou.s if. nerve, the upper part of the humerus, and the brachiali.* anticns inner border uuiscle. Its inner border is the guide to tlie brachial artery beh.w is guide to ^j^g middle of the humerus, but above that spot the coraco-bracliialis the artery , ^^^^^^^^^ intervenes between them. The connection of the long head of the biceps with the shoulder-joint and the insertion of the muscle into the radius will be afterwards learnt, use on Action. It bends the elbow-joint, and acts powerfully m rndina,

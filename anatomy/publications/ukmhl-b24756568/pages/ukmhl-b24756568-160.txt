DISSECTION OF THE THIGH. 144 parts closiiiR hollow beneath. The sjDace between the criu'cil arcli and the hip-bone is Lii'ger in the female than in the male, and is closed liy parts passing from tlie abdomen to the thigh. The outer half of the inter\al is filled by the ]2^3wi^ auclj]iaci^miiscles, bet^^^^ is the anterior crural nerve, while the external cutaneous ner\-e lies on the iliacus near the anterior sujieriotiliac spine : in this part Poupart's liga- ment is closely bound down to the nuiscle by its attachment to the iliac fascia. The iimer half is occupied by the femoral vessels and Fig. 56.â€”Disseotiun op the Crdral Sheath (iLLnsTRAiioNS of Dissections). A. Iliac part of the fascia lata, reflected. B.

Giiuberimt's Gimbcmat^s ligament, or the piece of the tendon of the external ligament: oij^jq^ie muscle which is inserted into the pectineal line, is about tliree-fourths of an inch in length, and is triangular in shape (fig. 97). Its apex is at the pubic spine : while its base is in contivcl with the crural sheath, and is joined by the faleifonn ligament of the fascia latfi. By one margin (anterior) it is continuous with the crural form and relations.

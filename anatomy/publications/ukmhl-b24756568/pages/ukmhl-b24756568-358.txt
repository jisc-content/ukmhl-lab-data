3i2 DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN. Trace out the duct. It is a compound gland, wiiliout a distinct capsule. the pylorus, and there they are visible without a lens, being nearly as large as henip-seed and appear lost after removal of the muscular coat. Dissection. The pancreas should now be placed on its anterior surface, and the excretory duet traced from the head to the tail by cutting away the substance of the gland. The duct will be recognised by its whiteness. Structure. The pancreas resembles the parotid gland in struc- ture, consisting of separate lobules, each of which is provided with a special duct. It is destitute of a distinct capsule; but it is surrounded by areolar tissue, which projects into the interior, and connects together its smaller pieces. The lobules are soft and loose, and of a Fig. 128.â€”A Small Piece op the Duodendm opened, with a pakt op THE Pancreas, showing the Temunation of the Bile and Pancreatic Duots (Henlk). a.

The duct of the gland: extent; branches; size and structure. greyish white colour, and are united into larger masses by areolar tissue, vessels, and ducts. The dud of the pancreas (canal of Wirsung ; fig. 128, d) extends the whole length of the gland, and is somewhat nearer the lower than the upper border. It begins in the tail of the pancreas, where it presents a bifurcated extremity ; and as it continues onwards to the head, it receives many branches. It is readily recognised from its whiteness on dividing the gland longitudinally. Of the tributiiry branches, the largest is derived from the lower part of the head of the pancreas. An accessory dmt is often found a short distance above the main one. The duct measures from i^th to '^^th of an inch in diameter near the duodenum. It is foruied of a fibrous coat with a very smooth mucous lining.

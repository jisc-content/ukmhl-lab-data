The TENSOR or circdmflexos palati {fig. 233, b ; 234 -) is a thin Tensor flattened muscle, lyini; immediately beliind the internal pterygoid jilate. About an inch wide at its origin, it is attached to the scaphoid fossa at the root of the internal pterygoid plate, to the arises outer side of the Eustachian tube, and to the spinous process of ; the sphenoid. The fleshy fibres end below in a tendon, which turns round the hamular process, and is inserted into a ridge close inserted into to the posterior border of tlie hard palate, and blends inferiorly o'/soft with the aponeurosis of the velum. palate; The fleshy part of the tensor palati is placed between the internal relaiiojis; Era. 234. 1.

The tendon enters the pharynx between the attachments of the buccinator muscle, and is thrown into folds as it winds round the hamular process, a bursa being placed between the two. In the soft palate it lies between the palato-pharyngeus and palato-glossus. Action. Acting from the skull the muscle will tix and make nse on tense the soft palate ; but its movements will be very limited, seeing that the tendon is inserted partly into the palate bone. The soft palate being fixed by its depressor muscles, the tensor, on tube, taking its fixed point below, opens the Eustachian tube in swallowing. The I'ALATO-GLOHSUS jiusci.E (constrictor isthmi I'aucium) is a ralato- small, pale band of fibres, which is contained in the anterior pillar (fig. 233, i) of the soft palate.

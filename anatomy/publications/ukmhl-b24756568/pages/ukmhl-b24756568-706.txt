The muscle rests on the ciico-thyroid membrane, and is concealed by the sterno-thyroid muscle. Action. It draws the cricoid cartilage upwards and backwards, so as to increase the distance between the thyroid and the arytenoid cartilages, and thus tighten the vocal cords. The POSTERIOR cRico-ARYTENOiD MUSCLE (fig. 244, c) aHscs from arytenoid is t^i^ depression by the side of the vertical ridge at the back of the on back of cricoid cartilage. From this origin the fibres are directed outwards cartilage: and upwards, converging to their insertion into the muscular process at the outer side of the base of the arytenoid cartikge.

It draws the arytenoid cartilage downwards and outwai-ds to a slight extent, separating this from the one of the opposite side ; but its principal action is to rotate the cartilage, turning outwards the vocal process, and thus dilating the glottis. Kerato-cricoid mmcle (Merkel). This is a small fleshy slip which is occasionally seen at the lower border of the preceding muscle. It arises from the cricoid cartilage, and is inserted into the back ol the lower cornu of the thyroid cartilage. The ARYTENOID MUSCLE (fig. 244, b) is single, and extends across the middle Une, closing the interval between the arytenoid cartilages behind Its transverse fibres are attached on each side to the outer

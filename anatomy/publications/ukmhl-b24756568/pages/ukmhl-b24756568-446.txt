Ugament" "^'^^^ subpubic licja-ment (ligamentum arcuatum ; fig. 159, d) is a strong triangular band occupying the angular interval between the pubic rami at the lower part of the symphysis. Its apex is continuous with the fibrous portion of tlie interpubic disc ; its base is free and concave, and forms the summit of the subpubic arch. Sow disc.

Interpubic The inicrpubic disc consists of a layer of cartilage on each side, which is firmly adherent to the ridged surface of the bone, and a fibrous portion in the middle.

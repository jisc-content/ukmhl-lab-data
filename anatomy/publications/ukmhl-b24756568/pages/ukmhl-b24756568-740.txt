724 DISSECTION OF THE BRAIN. cortical distribution of tlie anterior cerebral branch of the inteiUal carotid is mainly on the mesial, whilst that of the middle cerebral is on the outer surface of the cerebral hemisphere. AuUTior The anterior choroid artery (fig. 257," and fig. 258), is small, and arte™'.'' ai 'ses either from the trunk of Ihe carotid, or from the middle cerebral artery : it passes backwards on the outer side of the posterior com- municating artery, and makes its way between the hemisphere and the cms cerebri into the dentate fissure, at the bottom of which it enters the choroid ])lexus of the lateral ventricle. Circle of Circle of Willis (fig. 257). The arteries at the under part of = the brain are united freely both on their own side and across the middle line in an anastomotic ring—the circle of Willis. On each vessels that side this ring is formed by the trunk of the internal carotid giraig form it. ■ forwards the anterior cerebral, and backwards the posterior com- municating artery. In front it is constructed by the converging anterior cerebrals, and the anterior communicating artery. And behind is the bifurcation of the basilar trunk into tlie posterior cerebrals which receive the posterior communicating. In the area of the circle lie several parts of the brain corresponding with the floor of the third ventricle.

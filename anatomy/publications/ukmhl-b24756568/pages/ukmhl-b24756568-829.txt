In this cavity the nerve supplies filaments to the lining ,„embrane, membrane, to the fenestra rotunda and fenestra ovalis, and to the Eustachian tube ; and it terminates in the three under-mentioned and^other branches, which are contained in grooves on tlie promontory, and connect this nerve with others. , , , , i n„P to svm- Bmnches.

The second C) is the small (kep petrosal nerve, which i.s directed ^'J.'^J^'^P forwards through a canal beneath the cochleariiorm process, to join „erve, the carotid plexus of the symjiatlietic (sometimes also the large superficial petrosal nerve) in the foramen lacerum. And the third C) has the following course :—It ascends in front and small of the fenestra ovalis, and near the gangliform enlargement on tne ^01^3^1 facial nerve, to which it is connected by filaments. Beyond the union with the facial, the nerve is named small superficial petrosal, and is continued forwards through the substance of the temporal

THE PANCREAS. 32n The peritoneal relations of the duodenum have heen noticed at p. 301. Pancreas (fig. 122 and fig. 123, p. 331). The pancreas is situate Pancreas: behind the stomach, extending from the duodenum to the spleen, andtom; and occupying parts of the right umbilical, the epigastric, and the left hypochondriac regions. In form it is elongated, witli its right ])ortion much expanded from above down, con.stituting the head ; this part lies in front of the first and second lumbar vertebras, tlie great vessels and muscles intervening. The gland has a massive head embraced by the duodenum, a neck or iieail, Anterior border of pancreas. / Spleen. A.scending colon. Superior mesenteric vessels.

(From a specimen in the Charing Cross Hospital Museum.) slight constriction near the middle line, usually above the conver- gence of the mesenteric vessels, and a body extending across to the body left as far as the spleen. The left extremity of the body is commonly spoken of as the tail, but the gland is often not at all tapering in tail, this part. The BODY has usually somewhat of a twist upon it as it passes to Surfaces: the left (fig. 123) ; and it presents an anterior or gastric surface, au inferior or jejunal surface, and a poslerior. These surfaces are separated by upper, anterior, and lower borders. The transverse meso-colon springs from its anterior border; the upper layer of the peritoneum jjasses upwards over the gastric surface, and the lower layer is directed bacliwards across the inferior surface.

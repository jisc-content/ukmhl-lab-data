640 THE SPINAL CORD AND ITS MEMBRANES. small terminal fibrous cord before referred to ; but the membrane is to be raised while it is being cut through, so that the loose arach- noid on the cord may not be injured. After its division, fa.sten back the dura mater to a long cork strip with pins. Deop.s,L,faco The inner surface of the dura mater is n„w seen to be smooth mater. Fig. 194. —Lower end op THE Dura Mater with ITS Central and Lateral Processes. a. Sheatli of dura mater. b. Central tibroiis baml fi.\- ing it to the coccyx. The lateral offsets encasing the Jast two lumhar, the five sacral, and the coccygeal nerves are also shown. Each nerve is marked by the numeral, and the first letter of its name. FiQ. 195.—Membranes of the Spinal Cord. a. Dura mater cut open and reflected. h. Small part of the translucent arachnoid. h. Pia mater, closely investing the spinal cord. c. Ligamentura denticulatum on the side of the cord, shown by cutting through the anterior roots of the ner\'es. d. Processes joining it to the dura mater. c. Anterior roots of (he nerves, cut; and /, posterior roots, each entering a separate hole in the dura mater. g. Linea splendens. Subdural space. Arachnoid niemhranf! is loos(\ and shining, and everywhere free except at the sijols along each side where it is perforated by the nerves, and where it gives att^achnient to the processes of the ligamenlum denticulatum. The cavity between the dura mater and the arachnoid is named the subdtiral space. The ARACHNOID (fig. 105, b) is the tiiiu translucent covering of the cord immediately beneath the dura mater. It surrounds the

49 NERVES OF THE ARM. The ULNAR NERVE ( ^), derived from the inner cord of the brachial Ulnar nerve plexus, lies close to the inner side at first of the axillary, and then of the brachial artery as far as the insertion of the coraco-brachialis ; then leaving the blood-vessel, it is directed backwards through the inner intermuscular septum to the interval between the olecranon and the internal condyle, being surrounded by the liiuscular fibres is without of the triceps. There is not any branch from the nerve till it fa"aftiie reaches the elbow-joint. elbow. The INTERNAL CUTANEODS (2) is mainly distributed in the fore- internal arm. Arising from the inner cord of the plexus, it is at first fiei^e'be"-^ superficial to the brachial artery as far as the middle of the arm, ' fascia. 20.—DrssEOTiON of thk Inner Side op the Arm (Illusirations OP Dissections).

Near the axilla it furnishes a small oflset to the skin of the front of the arm. The NERVE OF Wrisberg (small internal cutaneous») arises verve of with the preceding. Concealed at first by the axillary vein, it is Wrisbe« directed inwards beneath (but sometimes through) that vein, and joins with the intercosto-humeral nerve. Afterwards it lies along the inner part of the arm as far as the middle, where it perforates ttie lascia to end in the integument. D.A.

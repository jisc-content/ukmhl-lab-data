822 DTSSROTION OF TF^R RAH. cochlear nervB has a spiral ganglion, and ends in organ of Oorti. Vessels of labyrinth. Auditor.v artery from basilar, has a vestibular. and a cochlear branch. Veins to petrosal .sinuses and internal jugular. The cochlear nerves traver.se the canals of the modiolus, and bend outwards in the passages of the lamina spiralis (fig. 304, As they enter the latter, they join a ganglion (yanglion spirale) which occupies a winding canal at the junction of the liimina spiralis with the modiolu.s ; and from thi.s they are continued a.s fine branches, forming a close plexus, to the organ of Corti. Blood Vessels. The membranes of the labyrinth are suijplied by an artery which enters the internal auditory meatus with the auditory nerve. The veins are more numerous. The INTERNAL AUDITORY ARTERY arises from the basilar trunk within the skull, and divides in the internal auditory meatus into two branches,â€”one for tlie vestibule, and the other for the cochlea. The vestibular artery subdivides into small offsets which enter the cavity with the branches of the auditory nerve, and ramify over the sacs and the semicircular canals. The cochlear branch breaks up into numerous fine twigs which enter the modiolus and the canals in the lamina spiralis. Ofifsets supply the nerve and the parts in the neighbourhood of the limbus laminse spiralis, and others ramify in the periosteal lining of the scales ; but there are no \'essels in the outer part of the membrana hasilaris. Veins. The internal auditory vein accompanies the artery, and ends in the inferior petrosal sinus in the base of the skull. The vein of the aqueduct of the cochlea joins the internal jugular ; and the vein of the aqueduct of the vestibule opens into the superior petrosal sinus.

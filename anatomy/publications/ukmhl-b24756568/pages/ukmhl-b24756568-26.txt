10 DISSECTION OF THE BACK. Norve of rhomboid muscles. Serratus inagmis muscle. Nerve to the rhomboid muscles. Tliis sleuder offset of the brachial plexus (fig. 8, p. 26) courses beneath the elevator of the augle of the scapula, and is distributed to the rhoniboidei on their deejj surface. Before its termination it supplies one or two twigs to the elevator of the scapula. Dissection. The levator anguli scapulaj and the rhomboid muscles are now to be divided about half-way between their origin and insertion, and the parts turned inwards and outwards. The small nerve to the rhomboids will be found running down to the deep surface of the muscles about an inch to the inner side of the upper angle of the scapiila, and the posterior scapular artery running close to the vertebral border of the scapula beneath the rhomboid attachment will be traced out. Finally, the vertebral border of the scapula will be drawn outwards, the loose connective tissue space between it and the chest-wall will be opened up, and the inner surface of the serratus magnus muscle, which is in.serted into the whole length of the inner surface of this border of the Ijone, will be cleaned.

RELATIONS OF LUNGS. 447 The posterior border is half as long a"ain as the anterior, and Posterior . . . eil^fi is projects inferiorly between the lower ribs and the diaphragm ; it is thfck. thick and vertical, and is received into the hollow by the side of the spinal column. The outer surface of the lune is conve.x, and is in contact with External the wall of the thorax : a large cleft, known as the great fissure, divides it into two parts, and on the right side there is an additional smaller fissure. The inner surface is Hat when compared with the internal outer : at the fore part is a large hollow which lodges the heart and great vessels, and is most marked on the left lung ; and behind '^'^''^'J^""^'^" this ia a depression about three inches long, Mhm pulmonis, which root.

In the hardened specimen well-marked grooves are seen upon the lung for the reception of the great vessels with which it is in contact, and on the left lung is a specially deep groove in its inner surface formed by the arch of the aorta, and by the descending thoracic aorta (fig. 163, p. 448). Each lung (fig. 161) is divided into twolobes by great fisswre, Division which, running obliquely downwards and forwards, begins at the posterior border near the apex, and ends at the fore part of the base, and the lower lobe of the lung is larger than the upper. In the a.rK\\,\\ii right lung a second horizonlal fissure is directed forwards from the ""'ght middle of the oblique one to the anterior border, and cuts off a small into lobes. Left ha.'i two,

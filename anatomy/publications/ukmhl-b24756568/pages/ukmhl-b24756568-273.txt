THE CLITORIS. ^57 each side of the vagina, to be inserted into the body of the clitoris insertion; The muscle covers the bulb of the vestibule and the gland of relations; Bartholin by the side of the entrance to the vagina. Action. Like the other orbicular muscles, the sphincter diminishes and use. that part of the vagina which it encircles ; and it assists in fixing the central point of the perineum. ^ „ . The ERECTOE CLiTORiDis (ischio-caveniosus) resembles the erector Erector ^ of the penis in the male, though it is much smaller (see p. 246). The TKANSVERSus PERiNEi is similar to the muscle of the same Sj'per^c^al name in the male. The one description will suffice for the muscle in both sexes (see p. 247). Dissection. The sphincter vagina should now be caret uliy removed from the subjacent bulb of the vestibule, and the erector muscles from the crura of the clitoris. The BDLB OP THE VESTIBULE (semi-bulb, Taylor, fig. 95, «) is an Butbsrf _ elongi ited and flattened mass of cavernous or erectile tissue, which is enclosed in a thin fibrous coat. It lies by the side of the vestibule and the entrance to the vagina, above (deeper than) the nympha, situation; resting against the lower surface of the triangular ligament, and relations; being"covered by the sphincter vaginte nmscle (a). Each is about an inch and a half long, and is larger at its hinder end, where it size; measures about half an inch in depth. By their narrow anterior ends the two bulbs are united in front of the urethra by a small con- necting venous plexus—the pars intermedia; and they are joined by connected_ a venous plexus to the small glaus of the cUtoris. These bodies answer to the divided bulb of the corpus spongiosum urethrie in the male. The CLITORIS (fig. 96, b. p. 258) is a small erectile body, and is the '^^^^^.^^^ representative of the penis. It has the same composition as the penis, except that the urethra is not continued along it. Its anterior extremity is terminated by a rounded part orglans(c),and is covered by a fold of the mucous membrane corresponding to the prepuce of hasa^glans the male. . P""; In its structure this organ resembles the penis in the following coniposi- particulars : —It consists of corpora cavernosa, which are attached by crura (one on each side, a) to the ischio-pubic rami, and are blended ^;P°™3^_ in the body. A small suspensory ligament descends to it from the superficial fascia of the mons Veneris; and along the middle is an imperfect i)ectiniforin septum. Moreover, it possesses a portion of corpus spongiosum, but this structure is limited to the glans coi-pus^_ clitoridis (c). (The penis is described on p. 253.) sum Structure. The outer fibrous casing and the septum are alike in ^d^erectiie both penis and clitoris; and in the interior of the clitoris is an erectile tis.«ue, like that in the male organ. The blood-vessels of the clitoris are like those of the penis, and the glans receives the dorsal artery (p. 253). Dissection. To see the triangular ligament of the urethra, the J^.^^^^^^^^^ erector and the criis clitoridis are to be detached from the bone on ligament, the left side. D.A. S

192 DISSECTION OF THE LEG. Deep part tlie fascia the leir. Clean the deep muscles; dissect peroneal artery. Fia. 74.- ihv inner aiilde and the heel are to l)e taken away to lay bare the annular ligament, but a cutaneou.s nerve to the sole of the foot, which pierces the ligament, is to be jjreserved. Deep ixirt of the fascia. This inter- muscular piece of the fascia of the leg is fixed to the tibia and fibula, and binds down the flexor muscles of the deep group. In the upper part of the leg it is thin and indis- tinct ; but lower in the limb it is much stronger, and is marked by some transverse fibres near the mal- leoli, which give it the appearance and office of an annular ligament in that situation. Iiiferiorly it joins the internal annular ligament be- tween the heel and the inner ankle. Dissection. The deep layer of muscles, the posterior tibial nerve, and the trunks and oft'sets of the pos- terior tibial vessels will be laid bare by the removal of the fascia and the areolar tissue. A muscle between the bones (tibialis posticus) is partly concealed by an aponeurosis which gives origin to the two lateral muscles (flexor longus digitorum and flexor haUucis); and it will not fully appear until after its membranous covering has been divided longitudinally and reflected to the sides.

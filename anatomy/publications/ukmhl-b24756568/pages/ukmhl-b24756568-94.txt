DISSECTION OF THIC HAND. 78 Flexor brevis pollicis. though it iJrojeots on its outer side. Along its inner liorder is the flexor brevis pollicis. Action. It draws the metacarpal bone inwards over the pains, rotating it at the same#tinie, so as to turn the ball of the thumb towards the fingers, thus producing the movement of opposition. The FLEXOR BREVIS POLLICIS ^ (c) arises from the lower border of the outer part of the annular ligament, and is inserted into the outer margin of the base of the first phalanx of the thumb ; its Flexor carpi radialis.

It lies along the inner border of the opponens pollicis, and i.s .superficial to the tendon of the long flexor. Action. The muscle bends the metacarpo-phalangeal joint, and assists the opponens in drawing the thumb forwards and inwards over the palm. * An inner head of tlic flexor brevis is commonly described as a small slip, which is concealed by the adductor obliquus pollicis, and which will be subsequently seen to piss from the uhiav side of the first metacarpal bone to be inserted Into tlie first phalanx with that muscle. It belongs, however, to the same plaTic of muscles as the rulductore, and will be described with the adductor obliquus pollicis, outer head to external sesamoid bone; relations; use.

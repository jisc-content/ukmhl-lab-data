595 THE SUBCLAVIAN VESSELS. The veins correspoiuling with the branches of the lh> roid axis ^^^^^^^ hiive the following tlestiiiatioii:—those with the sui)niscapular and to ivrtorieh" transverse cervical arteries open into the external jugular vein. But the inferior tliyroid vein, lieginning in the thyroid body, descends on the front of the trachea to the innominate vein. 4. The superior intercostal artery arises from the posterior part of 'jjj'^ljjljl'^^'^,^, the subclavian under cover of the scalenus anticus on the right side and branch, internal to the muscle on the left. It arches over the apex of the lung, and passes downwards in front of the neck of the first rili; its distdbution to the first two intercostal spaces has l)een seen in the thorax (p. 483). Arising in common with this branch is the deep cervical artery, '|™i>^^^ which passes backwards between the transverse process of the last oniiiuh. cervical vertebra and the first rib, lying internal to the two hinder scaleni muscles and the fleshy slips continued upwards from the erector spinee, to end beneath the complexus mu.scle at the posterior part of the neck as already seen (p. 532). A spinal branch is frequently given from the second part of the subclavian artery; its ofl'sets are continued into the spinal canal through the intervertebral foramina. The SUBCLAVIAN VEIN is much shorter than the companion artery, ^^'^'1'^'='''^^"" reaching only from the outer edge of the first rib to the inner border of the anterior scalenus. It is a continuation of the axillary vein, and ends by joining the internal jugular in the innominate trunk. Its course is arched below the level of the artery, from which it is separated by the scalenus anticus. Branches. The suliclavian vein is joined at the outer edge of the {^^.^jj^.j^^.^. anterior scalenus by the external jugular vein, and sometimes also by the anterior jugular. Into the angle of union of the subclavian and internal jugular veins the right lymphatic duct opens (fig. 215,°) ; and at the like spot on the left side, the large lymphatic or thoracic duels.' duct ends (fig. 215, 8). The highest pair of valves in the subclavian Vuives. trunk is placed outside the opening of the external jugular vein. It shoukl be borne in mind that occasionally the vein is as high P'^^^'ij"'^. in the neck as the third part of its companion artery ; and that it ' ' ' has been seen in a few instances with the artery beneath the anterior scalenus. The THORACIC DUCO? conveys the chyle and lymph of the greater JJj°™'='" part of the body into the venons circulation. Escaping from the thorax on the left side of the cesophagus, the duct ascends in the couira fi-om . , 1 » 1 the thorax, neck as high as the seventh cervical vertebra. At the spot men- tioned it issues from beneath the carotid artery and the internal jugular vein, and arches outwards and downwards above or over the subclavian artery, and in front of the anterior scalenus muscle and aiuijoins phrenic nerve, to open into the angle of junction of the subclavian with the internal jugular vein. Double valves, like those of the valves; veins, are present in the interior of the tube ; and a pair guards the opening into the posterior part of the vein. Frequently the f™!™^'^ upper part of the duct is divided ; and there may be separate openings into the large veins corresponding with those divisions. QQ 2

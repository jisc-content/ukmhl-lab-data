DISSECTION OF THE THORAX. state of ligaments. Bending to side : extent; movement ot bones ; state of ligaments. Rotation movement of bones; where present. eacli glide downwards on the upper ones of the next succeeding bone. The condition of the ligaments is the opposite to that in flexion. Thus, the intervertebi-al discs are conipre.ssed behind, and stretched in front ; the spinous and subtiaval ligaments are relaxed ; the anterior common ligament of the bodies is tightened, and the hinder band is slackened. Lateral inclination. The spine can be curved to the right or the left side. Like the last movement, this bend is least in the more fixed upper dorsal vertebrse, and is greatest in the neck. On the concave side of the curve, say the right, the Iwdies are l)rought nearer together ; and they are carried away from each other on the opposite aspect. The right inferior articular surface glides down, and the left up, in the joints with the vertebra beneath. On the right side the ligaments will be relaxed and the iuter- verteljral substance compressed ; and on the left those structures will be tightened so as to check the movement. Eolation is the twisting of the bodies of the vertebrae around a vertical axis through their centres, the fore part being turned to the right or left, while the lower articular jjrocesses glide in the opposite direction over the upper ones of the next bone below. The movement will obviously be checked by the tightening of one set of oblique fi.bres in the intervertebral disc. A pure rotation of this kind, however, takes place only to" a small extent in the upper dorsal region ; but in the neck a greater degree of turning movement is permitted in combination with lateral flexion, owing to the conformation of the articular surfaces. In the loins the articular surfaces are so disposed that rotation is impossible.

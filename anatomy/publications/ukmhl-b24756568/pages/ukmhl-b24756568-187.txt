LIGAMENTS OP HIP-JOINT. 171 Dissection (fig. 65, p. I73). The capsular ligament is now to Cut open Ijii divided over the prominence of the head of the femur, and this •'"I'snie. lionc being disarticulated luit not detached, the cotyloid and inter- articular ligaments inside it will appear. The interarticular or round Defiuoroumi ligament is attached to the acetabuhun by two pieces ; and to bring these into view, the synovial membrane and areolar tissue must be removed. The transverse ligament over the notch is also to be defined. The cotyloid ligament is a narrow band of fibro-cartilage, which is Cotyloid fixed to the margin of the acetabulum, and is prolonged across the "sameut notch below, so as to form part of the transverse ligament. Its fibres are not continued around the acetabulum, but are fi.xed to the attached margin of tlie cavity, and cross one another in the band. It is acetabulum; Fig. 64.—Hinder Paut of the Capsule of the Hip-joint. a. Longitudinal fibres. 4. Zonular baud. c. Thin piece attached to the neck of the femur about half-way down. thickest at its attachment to the bone, and becomes gradually thinner towards the free margin, where it is applied to the head of the femur. This ligament fills up the hollows in the rim of the acetaliulum, use. deepens the socket for the femur, and makes a fle.xible margin to the cavity, which can yield slightly when the neck of the femur is pre.ssed against it. The transverse ligament bridges acrcss the notch in the lower and Transverse inner part of the margin of the acetdjulum. It consists partly of "eament. deep special filjres which are attached to the margins of the notch, and partly of a sujierficial bundle from the cotyloid liga- ment Beneath it is an aperture by which vessels and nerves

Beneath them will appear the second or deep set of transverse filjres of the pons (fig. 204 /, j). 735).

The tru'inneise fibres of the ventral portion of the pons pass into the Trnnsverso middle peduncle of the cerebellum. They are mostly collected into v('''iinu' two layers, superficial and deep (fig. 200), which enclose the loiigi- portion, tudinal libres of the pyramid; but some ti'un.sverse fibres pass between the bundles of the pyramidal ti'act. The superficial fibres are nearly horizontal in the lower part of the pons, but the tipper ones descend to join the cerebellar peduncle, and some are seen on the surface crossing obliquely over the lower fibres. It will be found, however, that the same bundles of transverse fibres cannot be traced across in the pons from one side of the cerebellum to the 3 1! 2

DISSECTION OF THE THORAX. (liiatatioii of corpus ^?'a»fM. In tlie wall of the artery ojjposite each Hap is a •I'teiy. slight hollow—the sinus of Valsalva. Structure of The ^'alve.s are formed of fibrous tissue with a covering of the lining nienihrane. In each flap the fibres have the following arrangement: there is one band along the margin of attacliment; a second runs along the free edge and is connected with the projecting nodule ; and a third set of fibres is directed from the nodule across the flap, so as to leave a semilunar interval named lunula on each side near the free edge. and use. The iise of the valve is obvious, viz., to give free passage to fluid in one direction, and to prevent its return. While the blood is entering the artery the flaps are separated ; Ijut when the elasticity of the vessel acts on the contained blood they are thrown together in the centre of the vessel, and arrest the flow of the fluid into the ventricle. They are concerned in giving rise to the second sound of the heart. To o\icn left Dissectioil. To open the cavity of the left auricle, the apex of auricle. j-j^g i,eart is to be raised, and a cut is to be made across the posterior surface of the auricle from the right to the left pulmonary veins (see fig. 165, p. 453). Another short incision .should be made downwards at right angles to the first. The heart must necessarily be held up during the examination of the cavity. Form of The CAVITY OF THE LEFT AURICLE is Smaller than that of the le^ft'aL^cie ^''S^* ^"^^^^ '^"'^ rather quadrilateral in shape, with its longest diameter directed transversely. It is joined at each side by the two pulmonary veins of that side : and at the lower and fore part it opens into the left ventricle. Appendix In the front wall, at the left extremity, is the opening of the pecti^atr"" appendix, which is longer and narrower than the corresponding part on the right side. Musculi pectinati are also present, but on this side they are usually confined to the appendix. On septum To the right of the opening into the appendix, on the part of the forame°n °^ ^all formed by the septum, is a superficial fossa, the remains of the ovale. oval aperture through that partition ; this is liounded below liy a projecting margin, concave upwards, which is the edge of the valve that closed the opening in the foetus. This impression in the left auricle is above the fossa ovalis of the right cavity, because the apertui e between the two in the foetus was an oblique canal through the septum. Opening.s: The a-pertures in this auricle are those of the four pulmonary four pulino- velus, and the opening into the left ventricle. The mouths of each nary veins, ^j^'^, pulmonary veins are dose together ; those from the right and to lung open into the extreme right of the auricle against the septum, ventricle, ^^^t^ ^^^^^ j^c^ j^^„g ^j^t^, the opposite side of the cavity, near the appendix. Valves. The pulmonary veins have no valves. The aperture into the ventricle will be'subsetiueiitly seen to have a large and complicated valve to guard it, as on the right side.

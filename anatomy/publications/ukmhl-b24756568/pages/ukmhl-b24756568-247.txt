To the bone of the second toe there are two bands, one on each side ;-the inner is strong and is attached to the internal cuneiform ; and the outer is fixed to the external cunei- form bone. The metatarsal bone of the third toe is provided with one lateral slip on its outer side, which is inserted l>ehmd into the p\-tprnal cuneiform bone. ObU,ue plantar ligaments. A fasciculus of fibres extends acros,s oV^.<u.o from the front of the internal cuneiform to the second and third metatarsals ; and from the external cuneiform there is another slip to the metatarsal bone of the little toe. Tine of the Line of the articulation. The line of the articulation between the tarsus and metatarsus is zigzag, in conseciuence of the unequal acvoss the len-ths of the cuneiform bones. To open the articulation, the knite should be carried obliquely forwards from the tuberosity of the fifth to the outer side of the second metatarsal bone; then about two lines farther back for the union of the second metatarsal w-ith the middle cuneiform ; and finally, half an inch m fron of he last articulation, for the joint of the internal cuneiform with the first '""^T^otnovM cavities are present in these tarscmetatarsal articu- Twos>^^o- ''"^^ThCTe is one between the cuboid and the two outer metatarsals, which serves also for the adjacent lateral articular .surfaces of the latter bones, but this is not always separate from the following one. The second is placed in the joint between the external and middle cuneiforms with their metatarsal bones (third and second), and is an oltset of the common synovial cavity belonging to the articulation of the navicular with the cuneiform bones (p. 229) : prolongations from it extend between the lateral articular facets of the second, third, and fourth (inner .side) metatarsals.

COBACO-BKACHIALIS. â€¢15 supinating the radius. When the body is hanging by Uie hands it will apply tlie scapula tirnily to the humerus, and will assist in raising the trunk. With the arm hang- ing and the radius fixed, the long head -mil assist the abductors in removing the limb from the side ; and, after the limb is aliducted, the short head will aid in restoring it to the pendent position. The CORACO-BRACHI- ALis is partly concealed by the biceps, and extends to the middle of the arm. Its m-igin is fleshy from the tip of the coracoid j)ro- cess (fig. 10), and from the tendinous short head of the biceps. Its fibres become tendinous below, and are inserted into a narrow mark on the inner side of the humerus, below the level of the del- toid (fig. 17). Some of the fibres frequently end on an aponeurotic arch, which extends from the upper end of the humerus to the in- sertion of the muscle. The upper half of this muscle is beneath the pectoralis major (fig. 20, p. 49); and its inner part projects beyond the short head branch clo.se below the of the biceps, forming acroinio-lhoracic a prominence in the axilla. Its insertion is covered by the brachial vessels and the median nerve. The coraco-brachialis lies over the subscapular muscle, the and the trunk, oil humerus.

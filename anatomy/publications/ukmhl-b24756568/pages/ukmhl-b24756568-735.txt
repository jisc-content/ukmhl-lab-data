719 THE VKRTEBRAL AND BASILAR ARTERIES. round the medulla oblongata, between tlie pneumo-gastric and spinal accessory nerves,'to the median groove of the cerebellum. Directed onwards in the sulcus between the hemisphere and the inferior vermiform process, the artery readies the hinder margin of the cerebellum, and there anastomoses with the superior cerebellar artery. An ofl'set of this branch ramifies over the under part of the oitscts. cerebellar hemisphere, and ends externally by anastomosing with the artery of the upper surface. As the vessel passes by the side of 1. Internal carotid tniiik. 2. Anterior cerebral. 3. Anterior cominiiiiicating. 4. Middle cerebral. 5. Anterior choroid. 6. Posterior communicating. 7. Posterior cerebral. 8. Superior cerebellar. 9. Auditory. 10. Posterior inferior cerebellar. 11. Basilar. 12. Vertebral. 1-3. Anterior spinal. The anterior inferior cerebellar artery which i)asses outwards from the basilar behind No. 8 is not indicated by a pointer. the fourth ventricle, it gives a small choroid branch to the ple.\us of that cavity. The BASILAR ARTERY ("), formed by the unicm of the two verte- Basilar brals, reaches from the lower to the upper border of the pons, where ■"''"'■y • it ends by dividing into two branches (posterior cerebral) for the cerebrum. The vessel lies in the median groove of the pons, resting sitnniion ; against the body of the sphenoid bone. On each side of, and almo.st parallel to it, is the sixth nerve. Branches. Besides the two posterior cerebral branches, the artery branches ; supplies transverse offsets to the pons and the fore part of the cere- bellum, and a large branch to the upper surface of tlie cerebellum.

THE SPO>TGY BONES AND MEATUSES. ,!(;y angular si.ace in front in the macerated skull is filled in the recent p.iriiy carti- state hy the caHilaije of the septinn, which forms part of the parti- tion between the nostrils, and supports the lateral cartilages. Fi.xed between the vomer, the ethmoid, and the nasal bones, this cartilage rests in front on theinci.sor crest of the superior nia.xiIke, and projects between the cartilages of the nostrils. The septum' nasi is commonly bent to one side. The OUTER WALL has the greatest extent and the most irregular Outer surface. Seven bones enter into its formation, and they conie in the following order from before backwards:—the nasal and superior maxillary ; the small lachrymal bone and the lateral mass Fra. 236.—Outer Wall of the Nasal Cavity. 8.

In front of the bones, the lateral cartilaaes complete this boundary. " From this wall three slightly convoluted os..eous plate.s, named is irroj-uiar turbinate or spovcjy boms (tig. 236j, project into the cavity-—the °" ' upper (') and middle (^) are processes of the ethmoid, but the lower "v" one 0 18 a separate bone.

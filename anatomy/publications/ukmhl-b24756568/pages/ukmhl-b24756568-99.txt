SuPERFiCLVL Layer of Muscles (fig. 35). The muscles of the Superficial back of the forearm are arranged in a superficial and a deep layer, sc-veu'"'*' The superficial layer contains seven muscles, which arise, in part by muscles, a common tendon, from the outer side of the humerus, and are placed in the following order from without inwards :—the long supinator (a), the long and short radial extensors of the wrist (b and 0), the common extensor of the fingers (d), the extensor of the little finger (e), and the ulnar extensor of the wrist (f). There is one other small muscle near the elbow—the anconeus (g). The SUPINATOR RADII LONGUS (a) reaches upwards into the arm, supinator and limits on the outer side the hollow in front of the elbow. It '""S"" = arises from the upper two^-thirds of the external supracondylar ridge ■ of the humerus, and from the front of the external intermuscular^ septum of the arm. The fleshy fibres end about the middle of the forearm in a tendon, which is inserted, into the lower end of the insertion; radius, close above the styloid process.

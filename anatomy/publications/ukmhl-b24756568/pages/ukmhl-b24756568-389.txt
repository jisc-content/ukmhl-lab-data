The crural branch issues beneatli Poupart's ligament to supply the integument of the thigh (p. 140). 4. The external cutaneous nerve of the thigh ai ises from the loop between the second and third nerves, and appears aljout the middle of the outer border of the psoas. The nerve then crosses the iliacus to the interval between tlie anterior iliac sjiinous processes, and leaves the abdomen beneath Poupart's ligament, to be distriljuted on the outer aspect of the limb (p. 140). 5. The antei'ior crural nerve {k) is the largest offset of the plexus, and supplies branches mainly to the extensor muscles of the knee-joint, and to the integuments of the front of the thigh and inner side of the les. Taking origin from the second, third, and fourth nerves, this large trunk Fm appears towards the lower part of the psoas, where it lies between that muscle ^ and the iliacus. It passes ^ from the abdomen beneath Poupart's ligament ; but before the final branching T'le figures 1 to 5 mark the trunks of the in the thigh (p. 160), the nerve sends off the follow- ing twigs:— Some small hranchea to the iliacus ai'e furnished from tlie outer side of the nerve.

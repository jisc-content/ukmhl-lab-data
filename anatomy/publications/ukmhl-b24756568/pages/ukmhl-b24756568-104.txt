DISSECTION OF BACK OF FOKEARM. forearm between tlie last muscle and the radial extensors of the wrist (fig. 35). Opposite the carpus the radial arterj' winds backwards beneath its tendon. Between the contiguous borders of this miiscle and the supinator brevis the posterior intero.sseoiis artery (ft) appears. Action. By this muscle the thumb is carried outwards and backwards from the palm of the hand, and the hand is moved to the radial side. The EXTENSOR BREVIS POLLICIS (ext. primi internodii poll. ; f ; fig. 35,1.) is the smallest muscle of the deep layer, and its tendon ac- companies that of the preceding extensor. Its origin, about one inch in width, is from the radius and the interosseous membrane, close below ^Eeliftachment of "tlie last muscle (fig. 36). The tendon passes through the same space in the annular liga- ment as the extensor of the meta- carpal bone, and is inserted into the base of the first phalanx of the thiunb. With re.S2)ect to sur- rounding parts, this muscle has similar relations to the preceding. Action. It extends first the proximal phalanx and then the metacarpal bone, like its com- panion.

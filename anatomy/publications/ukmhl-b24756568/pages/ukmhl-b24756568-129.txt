THE GLUTEUS MAXIMUS. 113 the perine<al space, and in the rest of its extent lies obliquely across the back of the thigh. The hamstring muscles and the sciatic vessels and nerves issue beneath it. Action. With the femur hanging the muscle extends the hip-joint use on t''^ Â£rrt-_ by pulling back that bone.

When the limb is fixed, and the body is raised from a sitting on poivis, into a standing posture, the gluteus acts as an extensor of the articulation by moving back the pelvis ; and in standing on one leg, the muscle can draw the sacrum towards the femur, so as to turn the face to the opposite side. By tightening the ilio-tibial band (which is attached, below, to and on kne the front of the outer tuberosity of the tibia, to the outer side of the patella and to the fascia over the muscles of the front of the leg), the gluteus maximus also suijports and steadies the knee- joint in the extended position. In this action it is assisted by the" tensor fasciae femons, which corrects the tendency of the gluteus to draw the ilio-tibial band backwards. Dissection (fig. 48).

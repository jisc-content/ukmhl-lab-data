The portion of the muscle furnishing the tendon to the index finger is separated from the rest by a layer of areolar tissue, and arises chiefly from the interosseous membrane, parts Lying over the muscle are the ulnar vessels and nerve, the around it; g^^pgj.flgjfi] flexor of the fingers, and the flexor carpi ulnaris.

The muscle bends the joints of the fingers and the wrist; wrfs't"' but it does not act on the last phalanx till after the second has been moved by the flexor sublimis. How lingers The fingers are usually bent in the following order :â€”fii-stly, the articulation between the first (proximal) and the middle phalanges ; secondly, the last phalangeal joint; and thirdly, the metacarpo- phalangeal. Long flexor The FLEXOR LONGUS POLLicis (fig. 26, b) arises from the anterior surface of the radius below the oblique line (fig. 25), as low as the pronator quadratus, and from the outer part of the interosseous membrane ; it is also joined in most cases by a distinctslip arising in cominon with the flexor sublimis digitorutnjBlLhei' J^OTSJ^hjdultmial '""condyle of till'' bnmems nTlTie" cm'oiioig' process of the ulna.

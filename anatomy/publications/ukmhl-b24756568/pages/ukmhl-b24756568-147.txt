131 THE HAMSTRING MUSCLES. The BICEPS (fig. 53, D) lias two heads of origin, long and short, which are attached to the pelvis and the femur. The long head arises from the lower and inner impression on tTie jschial tuberosity, in com- mon with the semitendi- nosus muscle (fig. 47, p. 113). The short head arises from the femur lielow the gluteus ma.xi- inus ; from the outer lip of the liuea aspera, from the upper three-fourths of the line leading to the outer condyle, as well as from the external intermuscular septum (fig. 61, p. 158). The fibres end below in a tendon, which is inserted into the head of the fibula embracing_ the external Ititeral ligament (fig. 68, p. 179); and a slight piece is prolonged to the head of the tibia. The muscle is super- ficial except at its origin, where it is covered Ijy the gluteus maximus ; it rests on the upper end of the semimembranosus, on the Biccjis arisen by a long iiud a .sliDi't lieail: J is iiist-rted into tlie g tibiilaaiid tibia ; relations; Fig. 53.â€”Dissection of the Back of the Thioh (Illustrations OP Dissections).

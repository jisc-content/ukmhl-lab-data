Glfi DISSECTION OF THE PTERYGOID REGION. of the skull tlirough the foranieu ovale and foramen laceruni From the plexus the large internal maxillary vein leads hackwards and outlets, and another considerahle In-anch, the anterior internal maxillary or deep facial vein, descends to the face to join the facial vein. A IM'olongation of the plexus into the spheno-maxillary fossa is often distinguished as the alveolar plexus. Sary '^^^'^ INFERIOH MAXILLARY NERVE (fig. 222) is the largest of the nerve. tln'ce trunks arising from the Gasserian ganglion. It leaves the Fig. 222.â€”Debp View of the Pterygoid Region (Illustrations of Dissections). Muscles: A. Temporal reflected. B. Condyle of the jaw disarticu- lated forwards, with the external pterygoid attached to it. c. Internal pterygoid. D. Buccinator. F. Masseter thrown down. Nerves : 1. Buccal. 2. Masseteric, cut. 3. Deep temporal. 4. Auriculo-tempnral. 6. Chorda tympani. 7. Inferior dental. 8. Lingual. 10. Internal lateral ligament of the lower jaw. The arteries are not numbered with the exception of the internal maxillary trunk, which is marked with 9. skull by the foramen ovale in the sphenoid bone, and divides immediately below that opening into two principal pieces, viz., an anterior smaller part, which is distributed mainly to muscles, and a larger posterior part, ending in branches which are, with one exception, altogetlier .sensory. In addition to the-se, the nerve of the internal pterygoid muscle arises from the inner side of the primary trunk. Directions. Should the internal maxillary artery obstruct tlie view of the nerve, it may be cut tlirough.

818 DISSECTION OF THE EAR. Tube divided into two. Septum bony and membra- nous. Osseous part In the recent bone the tube is divided into two main passages (scalffi) by the septum (fis. 303). In the dry bone a remnant of this partition is seen in the form of a thin osseous plate—lamina sjnralis, projecting from the axis. Septum of the spiral tube (fig. 304). The partition in the recent state dividing the tube of the cochlea into two passage.s, consists of an osseous and a membranous portion :— The osseous farl ('), formed by the lamina spiralis, extends about half-way across the tube. Inferiorly it begins in the vestibule, ends above in a point over an aperture. Lamina spiralis has limbu.s on upper surface.

The remaining letters refer to parts of the organ of Corti. where it is wide, and is attached to the outer waU so as to shut out the fenestra rotunda from that cavity ; and diminishing in size, it ends above in a point—the hamulus, opposite the hist baU-tuni_^of the cochlea. Between the hamulus and the axis is a space, which is converted by the membranous piece of the septum into a foramen {hiatus, hclicolrema; fig. 303,/), and allows the intercommunication of the two chief passiiges of the cochlear tube. The lamina spiralis is formed by two plates of l)one, which enclose canals for vessels and nerves, and are separated farthest from each other at the axis. The upper surface of the lamina is covered in the outer fourth of its extent by a border or hmbu^ ot

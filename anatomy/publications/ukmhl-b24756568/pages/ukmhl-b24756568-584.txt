568 DISSECTION OP THE FACE. A^iibrous The palpebral fascia is a thin fibrous layer, which is continued troni the margin of the orbit to join the anterior surface of the fibrous tarsal jjlate. At the inner part of the orl^it it is tliiu and loose, but at the outer part it is somewhat thicker and stronger pia"e7onn. , ^^'^ ^^7''' (*^^''')' '^'^'^^ eyelid, are elongated part of the transversely, and give strength to the lids. Each is fi.xed internall/ I'd: and e.Kternally by fibrous bands—the tarsal or palpebral ligaments to the margin of the orbit. The border corresponding with tlie edge of the lid is free, and thicker tlian the rest of the plate. On the deep surface each tarsus is lined by the conjunctiva ttftwoiid" ^""^^^ '^re alike in the two lids. In the upper eyelid, where the filirous plate is larger, it is crescentic in sliape, and Ls nearly half an inch wide in the centre; and to its fore part the tendon of the levator palpebrae is attached. In the lower lid the tarsus is a narrow band, about one-si.xth of an inch broad, with nearly straight borders. Liganients The internal tarsal ligament (tendo palpebrarum) is a small attach tarsal 'i'^^^^ band at the inner side of the orbit, which serves to fix the plates. lids, and is attached to the anterior margin of the lachrymal groove in the upper jaw. It is about a quarter of an inch long, and divides into two processes, which are united with the tarsal plates, one to each. This ligament crosses the lachrymal sac, behind which it sends a fibrous expansion ; and the fleshy fibres of the orbicularis palpebrarum arise from it. The external tarsal ligament is a much weaker band uniting the tarsi to the malar bone. tiibeslnM • '^^^ Meibomian or tarsal glands are embedded in the substance of ^ ' • the tarsal plates, and can be readily seen through the conjunctiva on the posterior surface of the lids. They extend, parallel to one another, from the free towards the opposite margin of the tarsus ; and their number is about thirty in the upper, and twenty in the lower lid. The apertures of the glands open in a line at the free border of the lid near the posterior edge, structure ^^'^^ g^&ndi is a small yellowish tube, closed at one end, and having minute lateral csecal appendages connected with it. The secretion is similar to that of the sebaceous glands of the skin. Tendon of If the palpebral fascia be cut through in the upper lid, the tendon paYpebra. °^ levator palpebne will be seen to be inserted into the fore part of the tarsus by a wide aponeurotic expansion. Mucous The conjunctiva, or mucous membrane, lines (he interior of the lining of liii. 2yg^ froH^ it is reflected to the front of the eyeball. The line of reflection is known as the fornix conjunctivae, and is placed, above and below, some distance beyond the convex margin of the tarsus. Inside the lids the conjunctiva is inseparably united to tlie tarsi, and has numerous fine papillas. At the free margin of the lids it joins the skin, and through the lachrymal canals and na.sal duct it is continuous with the pituitary membrane of the nose. Caruncle Between the eyeball and the inner commissure of the lids is seen a prominent and fleshy-looking body—caruncula laclirymalis (fig. 207, ■'■), which contains a group of glands, and has a few minute hairs on il.s surface. External to .the caruncle is a small

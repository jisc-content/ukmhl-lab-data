DISSECTION OF THE BACK OF THE FOREARM. 84 and use, radius free and fixed. Extensor cirjii radialis longior: origin; the othei-s, with its edges fcjrwards and backwards. JLta anterior border "? touches the biceps and the pro- nator teres,; ^aiid'the posterior is in contact with both radial ex- tensors of the wrist. Near its insertion the supinator is covered by two extensors of the thumb. Beneath the muscle are the bra- chialis anticus and the musculo-^ spiral nerve, the extensors of the ''"fy"^^' ■tt'rist, the radial vessels and nerve, and the radius. Action. The chief use of the supinator longus is to bend the elbow-joint; but if the radius is either forcibly pronated or supi- I nated, the muscle can put the hand into a state intermediate between pronation and supination. If the radius is fixed, as in climbing, the muscle will bring up the humerus, bending the elbow. The EXTENSOR CARPI RADIALIS LONGiOR (b) arises from the lower third of the external supracondylar ridge of the humerus, from the front of the external inter- muscular septum, and from the septum between it and the next muscle. It lies on the short radial extensor, being partly covered by the supinator longus ; and its tendon passes beneath the extensors of the thumb, and the annular Fio. 35.—ScPERPioiAL Dissection of the Back of the FoKEAnM.

About two inches long, it is attached above is infra- to the apex and lower border of the patella; and below to the ["j^j";"' tubercle of the til)ia.

When the anterior portion of the capsule with the patella is thrown down, a fold (mucous ligament) will be .seen extending from the intercondylar fossa of the femur to a mass of fat below the patella. On each side of the patella is another fold (alar ligament) also over some fat.

The synovial membrane (fig. 82) lines the interior of the joint, synovial and is continued to the margins of the articular surfaces of the membrane bones.

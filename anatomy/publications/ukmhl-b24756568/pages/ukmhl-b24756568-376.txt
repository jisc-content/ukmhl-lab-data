360 DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN. as they ascetid to tendon; differences in the pillars. intermixing, but tlie inner fibres of the two crura cross one anotlier in tlie following manner :—Those of the right (e) ascend by the side of the aorta, and pass to the left of the middle line, decussating with the fibres of the opposite crus between that vessel and tlie opening of the oesophagus. The fibres of the other crus {d) may be traced iu the same way, to form the right half of the oesophageal opening. In the decussation the fasciculus of fibres from the right crus is generally larger than, and in front of, that from the left. The pillars difter somewhat on opposite sides. The right (e) ie the larger of the two, and is fixed by tendinous processes to the bodies of the first three lumbar vertebrae, and their intervertebral substances, reaching down to the disc between the third and fourtli vertebrae. The left pillar {d) is situate more on the side of the spine. Fig. 137.—Under Surface of the Diai'Hragii. A. Diaphragm. B. Pso.'us magnus. 0. Quadratus lumborum. a.

The arches (ligamenta arcnata) are two fibrous bands on each side over the quadratus lumborum and psoas muscles, which give origin to fleshy fibres. The arch over the psoas (lig. arcuat. intei-num: f) is the stronger, and is connected by the one end to the tendinous part of the pillar of the diajjliragm, and by the other to the transverse process of the fir.st or second lumbar vertebra.

APONEUROSIS OF THE EXTERNAL OBLIQUE. 267 Its margins are named pillars, and differ in form and strength in.jersu.e o.- The inner one, thin and straight, is attached below to the front of ' ti^^^^y^ pubis, where it decttssates with the corresponding iece of the opposite side. The outer pillar is stronger, and is " ved so as to form a kind of groove ibr the support ol the outer pauu-; snerma'tic cord; it is continuous with Poupart's ligament and is aSeilelow t'o the pubic spine. A thin membrane (intercolumnar fascia), derived from some fibres on the surface of the aponeurosis, margin; covers the oijening. ,. , ,. . The external ring gives passage in the male to the spermatic cord, objecU and in the female to the round ligament; and in each sex the trans- through, mitted part lies on the outer pillar as it passes through, and obtains a coverin.' from the intercolumnar fascia. Tlirongli this aperture an incniinal hernia protrudes from the ^vall of the abdomen The intercolumnar fibres (tig. 97) run transversely on the surface ot nar fibres: the aponeurosis, and bind together its parallel fibres, so as to con- struct a firm membrane. Interiorly, where they are strongest, some attachment weU-marked bundles are connected with the outer third ot Poupart s ligament, and the anterior end of the iliac crest. At the external abdominal ring the fibres stretch from side to side, and close the upper end of tiiat opening ; and as they are prolonged on to the cord from the margin of the ring, they give rise to a membrane named columnar the intercolumnar or spermatic fascia. On the left side, where the fascia is entire, this thin covering will be manifest on the surface ol the cord, or on the round ligament in the female. Dissection. To see the attachments and connections of Poupart s To see^^^ ligament, it will be necessary to reflect, on both sides ot the body, Poupart^ the lower part of the external oblique aponeurosis towards the thigh. For this purpose an incision is to be carried inwards, through the aponeurosis, from the front of the iliac crest to a spot about three inches from the linea alba ; and the tendon is to be throwdown detached from the subjacent parts with the handle of the scalpel, external When the aponeurosis cannot be separated farther from the tendons beneath, near the linea alba, it is to be cut in the direction of a line descending to the symphysis pubis. After the triangular piece of the aponeurosis has been thrown and^^^^^^^^^ towards the thigh, the spermatic cord is to be dislodged from tlie fascia, surface of Poupart's ligament, to see the insertion of the ligament into the pubis, and to lay bare the fibres (triangular fascia) which ascend therefrom to the linea alba. Poupart's ligament (fig. 97) is the lower border of the aponeurosis Pouparj^s of the external oblique, which is thickened and folded backwards, so as to form a slight groove with the concavity upwards. In the hollow of the ligament the lowest fibres of the internal obli(iue and trans- versalis muscles and the cremaster take their origin. Externally it onter and appears round and cord-like, and is attached to the anteri.jr superior J;;;;^';^".^^^'^'^- iliac suine. Internally it widens as it approaches the pubis, and is inserted into the pubic spine and the pectineal line of the hip-bone fn.™«^^_^_^^,^ for about three-quarters of an inch, forming a triangular piece with ngament;

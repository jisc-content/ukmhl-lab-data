It is not com- structure, posed of nervous substance, but consists of small follicles lined by epithelium, and containing minute granular masses of calcareous matter (brain-sand) : similar concretions are often found on its surface, and adhering to its stalk. The AQUEDUCT OF Sylviu.s (iter a tertio ad quartum ventriculum ; A^ufdiict of fig. 274) is a narrow passage, about five-eighths of an inch long, uniting the third and fourth ventricles and passing beneath Fig. 282.â€” Pusteiuor View ov the Conxbotions betwke.n tue Oerebiium, Medulla Oblongata and Cerebellum. 1.

LOBES OP THE LlVEB. 347 {suprarenal imincssion; sr i) into wliicli the right suprarenal body is received. Border. Tlie anterior border is thin, and is marked by two notches ; ^^^^^'^ one is opposite the longitudinal fissure on the under surface before alluded to, and tlie other is over the large end of the gall-bladder. Extremities. The right extremity is thick and rounded ; and the Extremities, left is thin and flattened. Lobes. On the inferior and posterior surfaces the liver is divided Lobes are primarily into two lobes, a right and a left, by the antero-posterior two'largo, or longitudinal fissure ; and occupying part of the right lobe are three others, viz., the quadrate, Spigelian, and caudate lobes. The left lobe is smaller and thinner than the right; on its posterior Left lobe^ aspect is a groove {oesophageal groove; fig. 131, a g) which lodges the by uisopha- lower end of tlie oesophagus, and widens out below into a hollow for the stomach {gastric impression; g i), occupying the greater part of the under surface of the lobe ; but next to the longitudinal fissure is a considerable elevation {omental tuberosity ; o t), which lies against the small omentum and the lesser curvature of the stomach. The right lobe forms the greater part of the liver, and is separated l^^g|^y^°^« from the left by the longitudinal fissure below and behind, and by P'^'*®" the suspensory ligament above. The under surlace has a fossa for fossa for the gall-bladder, and is marked to the right of this by three impres- s^'i-'^''"''!"'' sions;—the one next to the gall-bladder is the duodenal impression impressions, (fig. 131, d i), and corre.sponds to the second part of the duodenum ; d°num,' more externally is the renal impression (r ^ov the right kidney ; kidney, and farther forwards is the colic impression (c i) where the liver rests colon, on the transverse colon. On the posterior surface is the suprarenal ^^'j^J"JP^" impression {sr i) already referred to. The three following so-called "^^"^ ° ^' lobes also are portions of the surface of the right lobe ;— The quadrate lobe {q I) is situate between the gall-bladder and the and three^ longitudinal fissure. It reaches anteriorly to the margin of the ^"^^ ° liver, and posteriorly to the fissure (transverse) by which the vessels quadrate, enter the viscus. It is impressed by the pyloric end of the stomach and the first part of the duodenum. The Spigelian lobe (S I) is the part between the longitudinal fissure Spigelian, and the inferior vena cava, and belongs to the posterior surface of the liver. It forms the bottom of the hollow for the spine, "from which it is separated by the diaphragm and the aorta ; and it appears on the under aspect of the organ as a slight projection behind the transverse fissure. The caudate lobe (c I) is a narrow, elongated eminence, which is and caudate, directed from the Spigelian lobe behind the transverse fissure, so as to form the posterior boundary of that sulcus. Where the fissure terminates this projection subsides in the right lobe. Fissures. ExtendinjT nearly lialfwav across the right part of the Three 1 fissures liver, between the Spigelian and caudate lobes on the one hand, and yjz.^ the quadrate lobe on the other, is the transverse or portal fissure. It is situate much nearer the back than the Iront, and contains the portal vein, hepatic artery, and the nerves, ducts, and lymphatics of transverse,

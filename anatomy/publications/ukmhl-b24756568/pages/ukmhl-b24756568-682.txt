DISSECTION OF THE PHARYNX. 606 Vestibule. Lining of the mouth differs in parts: on roof, molar tootli in the upper jaw, is tlie opening of the parotid duct. The anterior opening of the mouth is hounded by the lips ; and the posterior is the istlinius faucium, leading into the pharynx. The space between the lips and the teeth is distinguished from the rest of the cavity as the vestibule of the mouth. The mucous membrane is less sensitive on the hard than on the soft boundaries of the mouth ; it lines the interior of the cavity, and is reflected over the tongue. lu front it is continuous with the skin, and behind with the lining of the pharynx. The epithelium cover- ing the membrane is scaly and stratified. Between each lip and the front of the corresponding jaw the membrane forms a small fold—frsenulum. Over the bony part of the roof it blends with the dense tissue enclosing the vessels and nerves ; on the soft palate it is smooth, and thinner. Along the middle of the roof is a slightly raised raphe, which ends in front opposite the anterior palatine fossa in a small papilla ; and on each side of this, at the fore part of the hard palate, there are two or three irregular transverse ridges. In the floor of the mouth the membrane forms the frtenum linguae beneath the tip of the tongue, and on each side of the frfenum it is raised into a ridge by the sub- lingual gland, at the fore part of which is a small papilla, perforated by the opening of Wharton's duct. On the interior of the cheek and lips the mucous lining is smooth, and is separated from the muscles by small buccal and labial glands. Over the whole cavity, but especially on the lips and tongue, are papilla3. The CHEEK extends from the commissure of the lips to the ramus of the lower jaw, and is attached above and below to the alveolar process of the jaw on the outer a.spect. The chief constituent of the cheek is the fleshy buccinator muscle ; on the inner surface of this is the mucous membrane ; and on the outer the integuments, with some muscles, vessels, and nerves. The parotid duct perforates the cheek obliquely opposite the second molar tooth of the upper jaw. The LIPS surround the opening of the mouth ; they are formed mainly by the orbicularis oris muscle covered externally by integu- ment and internally by mucous membrane. The lower lip is the larger and more moveable of the two. Between the muscular struc- ture and the mucous covering lie the labial glands; and in the sub- stance of each lip, internal to the muscular structure, and separated from the free edge by the marginal bundle of the orbicularis, is placed the arch of the coronary arteries.

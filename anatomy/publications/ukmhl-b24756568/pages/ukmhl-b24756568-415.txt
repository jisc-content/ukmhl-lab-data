At the l>ack of the pelvis it wiuds over the ischial sjjine of the hi]j-)wue, aud euters the perineal space, wheie it has already been examiued.

Tbe pudic artery is Boiuetiiaes smaller than An acc«ai. u.sual, aud fails ty supply some of its ordinary i>eriiic-al braucbes, especially sory piidic (lie tenuiual oue to the penis. Id those cases the deti.;ient hraiiches are derived froiu au accessory aitery, which takes origin from the internal iliac (mostly from the trunk of the pudic), and courses forwards on the side of the bladdej and the jjroKtate gland, to perforate the triangular ligament. It furniBhes braucljes to tbe jxjuis to supply the place of those tlat are wanting. The uUrim arUry (fig. 147, rf) passes inwaids between the layers b'teriue of the broad ligament to the neck of the uterus, where the vessel ' clianges its dijection, and asoeu<is iu a toi-tuous manner along the side ol' the uterus up to the fundus. Numerous branches enter the sub«un<;e of the utej'us, aud j-aujifying iu it, are remarksible for their U..nuous c<..nditiou. At the neck of the uterus some small oiisei* to twigs are supplied to the ujjptr part of the vagijia and to the ' bladder, wjmmunicating with biauches of the vaginal arterv.

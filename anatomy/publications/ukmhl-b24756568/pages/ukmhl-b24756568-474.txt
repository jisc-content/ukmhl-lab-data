DISSECTION OF THIC THOKAX. 458 1111(1 apex. Interior of appendix. Crista terminalis. apex is prolonged downwards towards the junction of the auricle with the ventricle, and in it is the opening into the right ventricular cavity. The anterior wall is thin and loose. Near the top is an opening leading into the pouch of the appendix, which will admit the tip of the little finger. Near, and in the interior of the appendix, are prominent (ieshy bands, named viusculi 2)eclinati, which run mostly in a transverse direction, and form a network that contrasts with the general smoothness of the auricle. The musculi j)ectinati, end upon a common ridge, the crista terminalis. The.posterior (and itiner) wall corresponds mostly with the septum between the auricles. On it, opposite the opening of the inferior Fossa vena cava below, is a large oval depression, the fossa ovalis, which is the remains of an opening between the auricles in the foetus. A thin semitransparent structure forms the bottom of the fo.ssa; and there is oftentimes a small oblique aperture into the left auricle at its upper part. Around the upper three-fourths of the Anniil.iH fossa is an elevated band of muscular fibres, called anmibts ovalts, which is most iirominent above and on the left side, and gradually subsides below. • f • 'Apertures of At the lower end of the posterior wall, between the interior caval and the auriculo-ventricular orifices, is the aperture of the

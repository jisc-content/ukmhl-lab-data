DISSECTION OF THE HAND. 82 as abductori and adduc- tors. Dissection. Annular ligament of fiont ot wist. The interosseous muscles also separate and approximate the straightened fingers, the palmar set adductiug tlie index, ring and little fingers towards the middle digit; while tlie dor.sal abduct their fingers from the median line of the hand, the two fixed to the middle finger moving it to either side of that line. Dissection. The attachments of the annular ligament to the carpal hones on each side are next to be dissected out by taking away the small muscles of the thimib and little finger. Before reading its description, the ends of the cut ligament may be jjlaced in apposition, and fixed with a stitch. The ANTERiOK ANNULAR LIGAMENT is a broad band, which arches over and binds down the flexor tendons of the fingers. It is Fig. 33.—The Three Palmar Interosseous Muscles. a. Muscle of the little finger. 6. Muscle of the ring finger. c. Muscle of the index finger. Fig. 34.—The Four Dorsal Interosseous Muscles. d. Muscle of the index finger. e and /. Muscles of the middle finger. r/. Muscle of the ring finger. Dissection. Insertion of flexor carpi radiali.s. attached internally to the pisiform and the hook of the unciform, and externally to the tuberosity of the scaphoid and the ridge of the trapezium, as well as by a deeper process to the trapezoid bone on the inner side of the groove for the flexor carpi radialis. By its upper border it is continuous with the aponeurosis of the forearm ; and anteriorly it is joined by the palmar fascia. Over it lie the pahnaris longus tendon and the ulnar vessels and nerve. Dissection. Follow the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis to its insertion into tlie nietacariial bones, by dividing the overlying part of the anterior ligament. The tendon of the flexor carpi radialis, in passing through the hand to its insertion lies in a groove in the trapezium between the

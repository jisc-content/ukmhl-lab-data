(i2(i DISSECTION OF DKKV VKSSELS AND KKltVKS OK NECK. Section IX. DEEP VESSELS AND NERVES OF THE NECK. Parts in tiiis In this SECTION are included the deepest styloid muscle, the section. internal carotid and ascending pharyngeal arteries, and some cranial and sj'mpathetic nerves. Position of Position. The position of the part is to remain as before, viz., the neck is to be fixed over a small block. Dissection Dlssectioil. To see the .stylo-pharyngeus muscle, the posterior pharyngeus, Ijelly of the digastric and the stylo-hyoid muscle .should be detached from their origin and thrown down. The trunk of the external carotid artery is to be removed by cutting it through where the hypoglossal nerve crosses it, and by dividing those branches that have been already examined : any veins accompanying the arteries are to be taken away. While cleaning the surface of the stylo- andgiosso- pharyngeus muscle, the glosso-pharyngeal nerve and its branches, iierve.""'^"' ^nd the stylo-hyoid ligament are also to be prepared. The side of the jaw is to be drawn forwards on the face. Stylo- The sTYLO-PHARYNGEUti MUSCLE (fig. 622,'% p. 622), resembles the piiaryngeus: ij^j^gj^. gtyioi^ muscles in its elongated form.

Action. It raises the pharynx, and tends to dilate the ]>art of the cavity above the hyoid bone. From its attachment to the thyroid cartilage it will assist in elevating and drawing backwards the larynx. Styio-iiyoid The stylo-hyoid lifjament is a slender fibrous band, which extends ligament ^.^^^^ jj^g ^jp t|,g styloid process to the small cornu of the hyoid lies by side bone. Its position is between the stylo-glossus and stylo-pharyngeus of preced- ^,^^^^(.135,^ ^nd over the internal carotid artery ; while the lower end is placed beneath the hyo-glossus muscle. To its posterior border, the middle constrictor muscle is attached below. It is frequently cartilaginous or osseous in part of, or occasionally in all its extent. Sometimes a slip of fleshy fibres is continued along it. mtcrnai The INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY sup])lies the deep parts of the tt?te"'^ head, viz., the brain, the contents of the orbit, and the nose ; and takes a circuitous course through and along the base of the skull before it ends in branches to the cerebrum. Part already The arterial trunk in the cranium has been already learnt, and its ophthalmic ollset will be seen in the dissection of the orbit ; but the

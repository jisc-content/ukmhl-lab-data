This vessel is of smaller size than the superior mesenteric, and arises from the aorta from one to two inches above the bifurcation. It descends, lying at first on, and then close to the left side of the aorta, and, after giving otf branches to the descending, iliac and pelvic colon, terminates as the superior hemorrhoidal artery to the rectum. rt.

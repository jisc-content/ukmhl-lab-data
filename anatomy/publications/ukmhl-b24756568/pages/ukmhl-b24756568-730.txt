Sometimes the ligament is hollow, and contains a synovial bursa. The interarticular fibro-cartilage (fig. 256,') will come into view by cutting the ligaments before described, and raising the clavicle. It isovalish in form and flattened, and is thicker at the cii-cumfereuce than in the centre. Its upper margin is firmly united to the inner end of the clavicle ; and laelow, it is similarly fixed to the cartilage of the first rib. At its circumference it unites with the capsule of the joint. The fibro-cartilage is of considerable strength, and prevents the cla\'icle being displaced upwards or inwards. Two synovial sacs are present in the articulation, one on each side of the fibro-cartilage. The external one is prolonged outwards for a short distance below, between the clavicle and the cartilage of the first rib. Movements. The clavicle can be moved upwards and downwards and forwards and backwards ; but the extent of movement in each direction is very limited, in consec^uence of the shortness of the ligaments surrounding the articulation : the forward and upward niovements are freer than the opposite. In the upward and down- ward movements, the clavicle glides on the interarticular fibro- cartUage ; and when the shoulder is depressed, the inner end of the bone is raised, while elevation of the shoulder is accompanied by a sinkijig of the inner end of the clavicle. In the forward and backward movenients, the fibro-cartilage gUdes in the same direction over the sternal articular surface. Dislocation may take place in any direction, except downwards ; but it is of rare occurrence owing to the strength of the ligaments.

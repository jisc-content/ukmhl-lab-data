After the removcal of the long oocipito-axial Disst-ctiou \ n / _ 1 u ui'trans- ligaiiieut, by cutting through it transversely above, and reHeuting ^^^.^^ it°downwarcls, the student should define a strong band, the trans- verse ligament, which crosses the neck of the odontoid process, and sends upwards and downwards a slip to the occipital bone, and the axis. The upper offset from the transverse ligament may be cut through afterwards for the purpo.se of seeing the odontoid ligaments, which radiate from the process, the central one being a slender band undoaontoid in the middle line, and the lateral, much stronger, pas.sing nearly horizontally outwards. The transverse ligament of the atlas (lig. 254, - and fig. 255, ') is a toIK strong arched band behind the odontoid process, which is attached '^^"^^'^ on each side to a tubercle on the inner surface of the lateral mass is tii» of the atlas, below the fore part of the upper articular process, ine ugameut, ligament is rounded at each end, but flattened aud wider in the middle : and at this spot it has a band of longitudinal fibres con- also named . 1 1 ■ /!■ ^r- • ■>\ i- 1 cruciform, nected with its upper and lower margins (fag. 254, -) so as to produce Fill. 255.—Atlas with the Tbansvekse Ligament. 1.

Towards the spinal canal it is concealed by the long occipito-axial ligament. This ligament forms, with the anterior arch of the atlas, a ring ^o^J^J^^.Jj"' (fig. 255, '■*) which surrounds the neck of the odontoid process of the pi^^asH. axis, and prevents separation of the bones. The lateral udontoiil or check liyavients (fig. 254, ') are two strong Check bundles of fibres, attached by one end to a flat impression on each side of the head of the odontoid process, aud by the other to a rough mark on the inner surface of the condyle of the occipital bone. These ligaments are covered by the long occipito-axial band : their upper fibres are short and nearly horizontal; the lower are longer and oblique. The central odontoid ligament is a small median cord, which Snsponsory passes from the tip of the odontoid process to the anterior margin of '■fe'-'""'^"'- the foramen magnum. When the transverse and odontoid ligaments have been cut Articular ^ through, the odontoid process will be seen to have two cartihige- odoiaoid

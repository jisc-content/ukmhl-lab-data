RELATIONS OF LIVEK. 30 Tlie remaining surface of the liver, the posterior, cannot be seen at present. The left lobe lies in front of the cesophafjus, and is attached to the diaphragm by a triangular fold of peritoneum—the left lateral ligamunt. The two layers of peritoneum fixing the right lobe are for Peritoneal tlie most part widely separated, and constitute the coronary ligament ; "^^tJ,'' but at the right end they come together, and give rise to a small triangular fold which is distinguished as the right lateral ligament LciCeroLl line Mid I Transpuic jlonc ne. ^ ^ The disc beCweerT* che 1^ and a"?

The portion of the surface between the layers of the coronary ligament is adherent directly to the diaphragm by means of areolar tis.sue : in this space also the right suprarenal capsule touches the liver; and the inferior vena cava is embedded in a deep groove in its substance. The liver changes its situation with the ascent and descent of the diaphragm in resjiiration ; for in in.spiration it descends, and in expiration it regains its former level, undergoing a sort of tilting downwards as it rests on the posterior body-wall. In the upright and sitting postures also, it descends lower than in the horizontal D.A. Position ig cliiingod by <lin]>limgni, iin<l liy jicsture of i>0(ly.

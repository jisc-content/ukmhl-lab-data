141 CUTANEOUS NERVES. other; it distributes branches laterally, but those towards the posterior surface are more numerous, and larger. MiDDLK CUTANEOUS (tig. 55, -). The nerve of the centre of the Midriie thigh is a cutaneous oftset of the anterior crural (p. 160), and ''"'•'""^""^ divides into two branches. It is transmitted through the fascia lata about three inches from Poupart's ligament, and its branches reaches tlio are contiimed to the kuee. In the fat this nerve is united with the genito-crural and internal cutaneo\is nerves. IntebnaTj cutaneous. This nerve is derived from the anterior internal crural trunk, and is divided into two branches (anterior and jiosterior) ""'"""o^'s = which perforate the fascia at separate places. The anterior branch becomes cutaneous in the lower third of the the anterior thigh, in the line of the inner intermuscular septum (fig. 55, ■'), along which it is continued to the knee. It is distributed in the extends to lower third of the thigh, as well as over the patella and the inner I (^tj^(y^ side of the knee-joint, and is nnited with the patellar branch of the internal saphenous nerve (fig. 55, »). The jJosterim-branch (fig. 71, ^, p. 188) perforates the fascia on the the posterior inner side of the knee, behind the internal saphenous nerve, with ^^J^f^ which it communicates ; it furnishes offsets to the npper half of V^ ^'(^Ct the leg, on the inner surface. Other small offsets of the nerve supply the inner side of the thigh, other small and appear by the side of the saphenous vein. One or two come {^JJ'j^j^^ ^° "-''^ into view near the top of the vein, and reach as far as the middle of the thigh ; and one, larger than the rest, becomes cutaneous where the others cease, and extends as far as the knee. The INTERNAL SAPHENOUS NERVE (fig. 55, a bl'anch of the internal anterior crural, is continued to the foot, but only a small part of it s.iphenous is now visible. It pierces the fascia close below the knee on the passes to imier side ; and after communicating with the inner branch of the ^^?^^«] y^T-X^^, intemal cutaneous, gives forwards some offsets "over the head of the <? ^ ' ' ' tibia. Finally, it accomi^anies the saphenous vein to the leg and foot. Its patellar branch (fig. 55, 5) appears on the inner side of the a branch on knee above the preceding, and is soon joined by the internal cuta- I'^'eiia neous neiTe. It ends in many branches over the patella ; these coiumunicate with offsets from the middle and internal cutaneons foi-ms a nerves, and form a network (yateUar ylcxus) over the joint. plexus. Dissection. Let the fat and the inguinal glands be now clean the rcmo\-ed from the surface of the fascia lata, the cutaneous nerves ^'^^'^"^ being thrown aside to be traced afterwards to their trunks. At the upper part of the thigh the cribriform fascia is to be and define removed with great care so as to show the saphenous opening, opeldng."*' without injury to the subjacent cmral sheath ; and on the other side of the apert,ure a .semilunar liorder is to l)e defined liy dividing the librous bands that unite it to t,he front of the .sheath. The fascia lata is the deep aponeurosis of the thigh. It is of Fascia lata (I bluish-white colour, and surrounds the limb with a lirm .sheath ; j/^™"'"''* but in fat bodies it is sometimes so slight as to be tiiken away with the subcutaneous fat.

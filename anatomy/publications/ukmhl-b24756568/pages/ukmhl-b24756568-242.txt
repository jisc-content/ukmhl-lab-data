' Astragalus with the navicdlar bone. Tlie head of the astragalus is received into the liollow of the navicular bone, and is united to it by a dorsal ligament ; but the place of plantar and lateral ligaments is supplied by strong bands between the os calcis and the navicular bone. The iistragalo - navicular ligament (fig. 87, cl) is attached to the astra- galus close to the articulation, and to the dorsal surface of the navicular bone : its attachments will be better seen when it is cut through. Dissection. The e.vternal ligament of the articulation may be seen on the dorsum of the foot in the hollow between the os calcis and the navi- cular bone, and if the tendon of the tibialis posticus be removed, the internal ligament will be exposed, covering the head of the astragalus on the inner side and below. The internal or inferior calcaneo- navicular ligament (fig. 89, c, p. 227) is attached behind to the inner and fore parts of the sustentaculum tali of the OS calcis, and in front to the inner extremity and lower border of the navicular bone.

The external calcaneo-navicular ligament (fig. 87, c) is placed outside the head of the astragalus, and is about, three-quarters of an inch deep. Behind, it is fixed to the upper part of the os calcis, between the articular surfaces for tlie cuboid bone and astragalus ; and in front it is iii-serted into the outer side of the navicular"bone. The synovial cavilg of this articulation is continued backwards into the joint between the front of the os calcis and the astragalus. Articular surfaces.

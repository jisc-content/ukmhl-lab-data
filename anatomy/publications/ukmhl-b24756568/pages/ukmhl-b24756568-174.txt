DISSECTION OF THE THIGH. 158 fibres are prolonged over the front of the bone into the ligamentum patellaj below, which forms the continuation of the tendon. Between Sub-crureal the suprapatellar tendon and the femur there is a bursa, which usually opens into the knee-joint. Lay bare Dissectioil.

It extends from the lower margin of the patella to the ' tubercle of the tibia ; and a bur-sa separates it from the bone above its insertion.

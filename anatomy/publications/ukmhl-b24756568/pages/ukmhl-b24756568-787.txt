The CORVORA QUADRIGEKINA (fig. 277) are four jiromiiient bodies, Qimdn- an npper and lower jjaii-, which are separated by a ci-ucial groo\-e. fiol'i'j'l.l,''.'

From the outer side of each ([uadrigeininal body a white band, hrachium Hmcliin.

At the upper edge of the pons the outer part of the fillet becomes superficial, and curving round the ending ..f tegmentmn (fig. 280), passes to the qnadrigeminal bodies, particularly , to the posterior, in which many of the fibres are lost, while others part ,1',',^ 3 D 2

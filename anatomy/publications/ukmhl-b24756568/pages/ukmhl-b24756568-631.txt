BRANCHES OF THE INTERNAL MAXILr,ARY ARTERY. 615 the Iwne, and ramifies in tlie meatus and on the tympanic memhrane. . x.r , , C Tlie SMALL MIDDLE MKNIXOEAL BRANCH V.egUl.S near the to ton skull, and courses througli the foramen ovale with the inferior maxillary nerve : it ramifies in the dura mater in the middle fossa of the skull. Another small branch springs from the dentvU artery or from tlie m-anch witl, internal maxillary trunk, and accompanying the lingual nerve, ends in the cheek and the mucous membrane of the mouth. The branches from the second part of the artery (between the ^^'^^ temporal and external pterygoid muscles) are distnlnited to the temporal, masseter, buccinator, and pterygoid muscles. The DEEP TE.MPORAL ARTERIES are two in number, anterior and to^ji«_..^j posterior, and ascend on the side of the skull beneath the temporal „uiscie'; muscle. The posterior anastomoses with the middle temporal branch of the superficial temporal artery ; the anterior communi- cates, through the malar bone, with branches of the lachrymal artery. The MASSETERIC ARTERY Is directed outwards with the nerve of toUie^^^^^ the same name behind the tendon of the temporal muscle, and passing through the sigmoid notch, enters the deep surface of the masseter muscle. Its liranches anastomose with the other offsets to the muscle from the external carotid trunk. The BUCCAL BRANCH quits the artery near the upper jaw, and ^ tj>|^^_ descends beneath the insertion of the temporal nniscle with its com- panion nerve : it is distributed to the buccinator muscle and other structures of the cheek, joining branches of the facial artery. The PTERYGOID BRANCHES are uncertain in their position and to iiterygoM number ; whether derived from the trunk or some of the branches of the internal maxillarv, thev enter the two pterygoid muscles. Of the branches that'arise from the artery in the third part of its Br;j;;<-J;^^;^°f course, viz. in the sphenn-maxillary fossa, only one, the posterior ^^^^ ^^^^ dental, will be now described. The remainder will be examined „ow seen with the superior maxillary nerve and Meckel's ganglion ; they are infra-orbital, descendvig palatine, spheno-falatim, Vidian, and ptenjgo-palatine. The POSTERIOR DENTAL BRANCH arises as the artery enters the si)heiio-maxillary fossa, and descends with a tortuous cour.-se on the rie„tai. zygomatic surface of the upper jaw, along with a small branch of the superior maxillary nerve. Its branches mostly enter the canals of the bone and supply the upper molar and liicuspid teoth,^ as well as the lining membrane of the antrum ; some external ofisets are furnished to the gum. The INTICRNAL MAXILLARY VEIN is a sliort trunk, often double, J^to™^'^ which leaves the hinder part of the pterygoid plexus, and runs back- vc'ih arises wards, Ijeiieath the jaw with the first jjart of the internal maxillary from artery, to join the superficial temporal vein in the parotid gland. The pterygoid plexus is an extensive network of veins surrounding Pj'^j|:y«':''^ the internal maxillary artery and the pterygoid muscles. Into it ' ' ' ' the veins corresponding to the branches of the artery empty them- selves and it communicates with the cavernous sinus in the interior tribuiarie.s,

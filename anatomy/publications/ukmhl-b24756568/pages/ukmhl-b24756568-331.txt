315 SUPERIOR MESENTERIC ARTERY. (/. The inferior ■panmaUco-(hwdenal artery (6) is small, and Bincn-alico- usually arises in common with tlie first intestinal branch. It is ' directed to the right between tlie pancreas and duodenuui, to both of which it supplies branches, and anastomoses with the superior pancrealico duodenal artery from the hepatic. The inlestiual branches [ov the jejunum and ileum (/) are twelve f™;,'^'/,^^^^;' or more in number, and pass from the left side of the artery between tine: Fio. 116.—SupEKioii Mesenteric Auteuy and its Beanokes (Tieuemann).

About two inches from their origin briincluw tlie branches bifurcate, and the resulting pieces unite with similar offsets from the collateral arteries, so as to form a series of arches. From the convexity of the arches other branches take origin, which divide and unite as before. This process is repeated three or four times between the origin and the distribution, but at each branching the size of the vessels diminishes. From the last set of arches twigs aistiibuUon are sent to the intestine on both aspects of the tube, and anastomose °" round it. a

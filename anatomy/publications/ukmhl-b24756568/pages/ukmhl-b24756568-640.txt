Submaxil- lary ganglion Other Khxiiients are supplied to the mucous membrane of the mouth, the gums, and the sublingual gland. Lastly, the brmichus for the tonijae ascend through the muscular substance, and are distributed to the conical and fungiform papilla;. The SUBMAXILLARY GANGLION (tig. 224, ^) reseuibles the other ganglia connected with the three tru7]ks of the fifth nerve, and communicates with motor, sensory, and sympathetic nerve. It lies on the hyo-glossus muscle immediately above the deep part of the FiQ. 224.—Deep View of the SnsMAXiLLAiiT Region (Illustratioks OF Dissections). Muscles : A. Genio-glossus. B. Genio hyoid, c.

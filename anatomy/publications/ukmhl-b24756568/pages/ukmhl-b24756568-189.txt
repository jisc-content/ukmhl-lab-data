MOVEMENTS OF HIP-JOTNT. Flexion and extension. In the swinging movement flexion is freer Swinging than extension, the tliigh being callable of such elevation as to touch the belly. While swinging, the liead of the femur revolves in the bottom motion of of the acetabulum, rotating around a horizontal axis ; and the femu"^ rapidity and extent of the movements do not endanger the security of the joint, the head of the bone not having any tendency to escape. In extension the strong ilio-femoral ligament (the inner band checks to especially) is tightened, and stops the movement. Flexion is not ™°^""^''"*'' naturally arrested by the ligaments of the joint, but by the meeting of the soft parts of the thigh and abdomen. In ahcluctionAwAacldnctionihe. femnr is removed from, or brought Lateral towards, the middle line of the body, and, of the two, abduction is "'o^''""«nt = the more exten.sive. In both stiites the head moves in the opposite direction to the motion of shaft. Thus, as the femur is abducted, the head descends, and a ''i>«''ead; great part of the articular surface projects below the acetabulum; and when the limb is raised to its utmost, the upper edge of the neck meets the edge of the socket, so as to prevent further motion. As the Innb descends and approaches the other, the head rises in

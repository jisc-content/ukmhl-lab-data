Section II. THE POPLITEAL SPACE AND THE BACK OF THE THIGH. Directions. Directions. The ham or popliteal space should be taken after the buttock, in order that it may be seen in a less disturlied state than if it were dissected after the examination of the muscles at the back of the thigh. When this space has been learnt, the student will return to the dissection of the thigh. Position. Position. The limb should be raised on blocks into the hori- zontal position. Take the Dissection (fig. 51, p. 126). To remove the skin from the overtlie"' popliteal region, let a longitudinal iiui.sion be made behind the knee iiam. from a distance of six inches above to four inche.s below tlie joint. At each e.vtremitj' of this cut make a transverse incision, and raise the skin in two Haps, the one being turned outwards and the other inwards.

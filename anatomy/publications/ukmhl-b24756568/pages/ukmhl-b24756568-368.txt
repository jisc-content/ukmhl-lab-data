This condition will be seen, with the aid of a lens, to be most developed about the centre of the sac, and to diminish towards each extreinity. In the bottom of the larger pits are depressions leading to recesses. Where the gall-bladder ends in the cystic duct (fig. 133) its coats project into the interior, and give rise to ridges resembling those in the sacculated large intestine. The cystic duct (6) joins the hepatic duct at an acute angle, to form the common bile-duct. It is about an inch and a half long, and IS distended and somewhat .sacculated near the gall-bladder.° Anterior border of pancreas. Spleen. Ascending colon. Superior mesenteric vessels. Descending colon. Lower part of the splenic flexure of the colon. Fig. 134.—Deep Viscera op the Abdomen of a Child. (From a specimen in the Charing Cross Hospital Museum.) Mucous coat like a screw. structure. Structure. The coats of the duct are formed like those of the sac from which it leads, but the muscular fibres are very few. The mucous lining is provided with glands, as in the hepatic and common bile-ducts. On opening the duct the mucous membrane may be observed to form about twelve semi-lunar projections (6g. 133, c), which are arranged obliquely around the tube, and increase in size towards the gall-bladder. This structure is best seen on a gall-bladder which has been inflated and dried, as in this state the parts of the duct between the ridges are most stretched. Blood-vessels and nerves. The vessels of (he gall-bladder are named cystic. The artery is a branch of the hepatic; and the cystic vein nerves and opens into the light branch of the vena portse. The nerves are Artery and vein :

734 DISSECTION OF THR BRAIN. taking liold of a bundle of fibres in the forceps or lingers and gently tearing tliem up that thoy will separate in their proper direction. To expose the connectiim of the pyramid with the spinal cord he should take hold of with the forceps and turn outwards on the left side, as in fig. 203, the small part of the anterior cohinin of the cord at the lowest part of the specimen (which will be below the decussation), and the pyramid of the right side will then be seen to divide below into two parts, one passing directly into the anterior column, and the other crossing the median fissure and disappearing in the ojiposite half of the cord.

Fibres of Pyramid and anterior column. The fibres of the pyramid form a the pyramid well-defined and independent bundle (seen in section on fig. 265 a, p. 736) thnnigh the whole e.xtent of the medulla oldongata, and are continued below partly into the antcricn- column of the .sanu' snlc of the cord and partly into the lateral column of the opposite half. The set of fibres kee])ing to the same side forms the outer portion of the pyramid, but in the anterior column of the cord, where it is direct, known as the direct pyramidal tract, it is placed close to tlie anterior How ti) i*xi>ost.i tliu ]iyiaiiiidul liuros,

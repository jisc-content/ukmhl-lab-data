NERVES IK 3ASE OF SKULL. 616 case of the second nerve, terniincates as the nerve enters the dura mater. Some of the nerves in the middle fossa of tlie skull pierce the dura mater before tliey reach the foramina of e.xit. The nerves are arranged in twelve pairs, whicli are enumerated fi'om before backwards in the order in which they perforate the dura mater. Only part of the intracranial course of each nerve will be .seen at this only partly stage ; the rest will be learnt in the dis.section of the liase of the brain.

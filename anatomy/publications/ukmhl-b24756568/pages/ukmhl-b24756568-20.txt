4 DISSECTION OF THE BACK. In the flovsal region. the III tliu loins. Dissection. Trapezius: origin ; umer The student is now concerned with hranches of the dor.sal and limibar nerves. See fig. 2. Dorsal nerves (D. 1—12). These are furnished by both and outer Ijranches—the upper six or seven from the inner, and the lower five or six from the outer. On the surface they are directed outwards in the integument over the trapezius and latissimus dorsi muscle.?. The U2)per nerves perforate the trapezius near the .spines of the vertebra; and the branch of the .second, which is larger than the rest, extends out- wards over the scapula. The loioer nerves pierce the latissimus dorsi mostly in a line Avith the angles of the ribs; the number of the superficial oflsets from these nerves often varies. Lumbar nerves (L. 1—3). In the loins the nerves are derived from the outer branches of the first three lumbar nerve trunks; they perforate the latissimus dorsi muscle at the outer liorder of the erector spinse, and crossing the iliac crest of the hip-bone, are distributed in the integuments of the buttock. First Layer of Muscles (fig. 3). Two muscles, the trapezius and the latissimus dorsi, are included in this layer, and cleaned. Dissection, fatty layer and deep fascia are together from the trapezius and lati.ssimus dorsi in the direction of the fibres of each, viz., from the .shoulder to the spinal column ; and the up])er limb is to be carried backwards or forwards according as it may be necessary to put the diftereut portions of the muscles on the stretch. Some of the cutaneous nerves and vessels may lie_ left in order that they may be afterwards traced through the niu.scles t^ their origin. The TRAPEZIUS MUSCLE (fig. 3, a) is triangular in .shape, with the base towards the spine, but the two nuiscles together have a trapezoid form. The muscle has an extensive ori{/i>i, l«y .short are now to be The superficial the unimportant to be removed Fig. 2.- -CuTANEous Nerves ok THE Back.

THE RECTI MUSCLES. G49 The SIXTH NERVE (tig. 230, -) lies below the other nerves, and Sixth nerve, aliove the ophthalmic veins, in the interval between tlie heads of the external rectu.s. In the orbit it tirst lies against, and then penetrates the inner surface of the external rectus muscle. Recti Muscles. The internal (fig. 230, d), inferior (c), and external Striiiuht rccti{B) are placed with reference to the ej-eball as their nanies "yi^jjjjf'f.''^ express. They anse posteriorly from the circumference of the optic origin. Fiu. 230.â€”Third View op the Ohbit (Illustrations op Dissections) Muscles: A.

Branch rectus. of third to inferior of third to internal foramen by a coniiiion attachment, which partly surrounds the optic nerve. The e.xternal rectus differs from tlie others in having two Extendi heads : the upper one arises on the outer margin of the optic foramen : and joins the superior rectus in the common origin : the lower and larger head blends ou the one side with the inferior rectus in the common origin, and on the other side is attached to a bony point on the lower border of the splienoidal fissure near the irtner end, while some of its muscular fibres are also connected with a tendinous baud

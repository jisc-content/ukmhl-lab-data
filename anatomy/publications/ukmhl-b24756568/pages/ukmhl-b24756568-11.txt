PREFACE. In preparing this edition of Ellis's "Demonstrations of Anatomy," it has been my first care to preserve those features for which the book has been so justly valued in the past, and not to interfere with its general style and character. The advances in the knowledge of anatomy during recent years and the present order of teaching have, however, necessitated many changes. The matter has been altogether re-arranged, and it now follows the ordinary course of dissection as taken by students, beginning with the simpler anatomy of the upper and lower limbs and ending with the more complex parts of the head and neck and the organs contained therein. In some places old matter has been taken away, and in many parts new work has been brought in, especially in those dealing with the different viscera. In this connection I wish to acknowledge the debt I owe to the works, amongst others, of Birmingham, Cunningham, Symington, Keith, Dixon, Elliot Smith, Berry, Jonnesco, Young and Eobinson. Sixty-two illustrations have been added, twenty-seven of them in colours, and amongst the subjects of these latter are those of many of the bones showing the attachments of the muscles. Forty-eight old illustrations have been reproduced in colour, and several of the blocks have been retouched.

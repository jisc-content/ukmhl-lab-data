DISSECTION OF THE EYIC 802 lineH on tlio surruces; atructure is laminar and fibrous, Change in form of lens in colour and con- sistence, with age. from the circumference to the centre ; for while the superficial layers may he ruhbed oft' with the finger, the deeper portion is firm, and is named the nucleus. On eacli surface are three lines diverging from the centre, and reaching towards the margin ; they are the edges of planes or " septa," where the ends of the lens-fibres meet, and are so situate that those on one side are intermediate in position to those on the other. In the human eye they are not distinctly seen, because they bifurcate repeatedly as they extend outwards. Structure. After the lens has been hardened by spirit or by boiling, it may be demonstrated to consi.st of a series of layers (fig. 294) arranged one within another, like those of an onion. The laminse of each surface have their apices in the centre, where the septa meet; they may be detached from one another at that spot, and turned outwards to- wards the equator of the lens. The laminse are composed of fine parallel fibres which run between two septa on opposite aspects of the lens. Ghanges in the lens with age. The form of the lens is nearly spherical in the fojtus ; but its convexity decreases with age, particularly on the anterior surface, until it becomes flattened in the adult. In the foetus it is soft, rather reddish in colour, and not quite transparent; in mature age it is firm and clear ; and in old age it becomes flatter on both surfaces, denser, and of a yellowish colour.

The capsular litjamcnl (fig. 25G, ') is a stout membrane surrounding I'ibious the articular portions of the bones and the fibro-cartilage. Its fibres run obliquely from the clavicle downwards and inwards to the sternum. The stronger parts in front and behind are described as the anterior and posterior sterno-clavicular ligaiiients. The inlerdavicnlar ligament (fig. 256,") extends above the sternum, imcr- betweeii the ends of the clavicles. The fibres dip into the hollow between the collar-bones, and are Cdiinected with the upper edge of the sternum. The ojHto-cluvicidar or rlwvihoid lujament (fig. 2.j6, -) is a short an.l cosio- etrong band of oblique fibres, passing from the upper surface of the t^^l^

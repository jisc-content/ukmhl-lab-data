59 DISSECTION OF FRONT OF FOUEAEM. sides of the Imineru.s. The space shin to disphiy the bnicliial and forearm vessels, the median nerve and branches, the musculo - spiral nerve, and the re- current radial and ulnar arteries. In the lower half of the forearm a large artery, radial, is to he laid bare along the outer side of the tendon of the He.\or carpi radialis ; and at the inner side, close to the annular ligament, the trunk of the ubiar artery will be recognised as it becomes superficial. These vessels and their branches should be carefully cleaned ; and the adjoining muscles may be fixed with stitches to prevent their displacement. The anterior annular ligament of the wrist, which arches over the tendons passing to the hand, is next to be de- fined. This strong band is at some depth from the surface ; and while the student removes the fibrous tissue superficial to it, he must take care of the small branches of the median and ulnar nerves to the jjalni of the hand. The ulnar ve.ssels and nerve (covered by an exj)ansion connected with the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris internal to the pisiform bone) pa.ss over the ligament, and will serve as a guide to its depth.

Lastly, in front of this ridge, and close to the roof of the fore part of the cavity, is the ending of the niul canal of canal for the tensor tym.iMni muscle (cU). The canal is sejiarated from tyniiiaiii. the Eustachian tube (et) below it by a thin plate of bone named tlie cochlear iform process {cp); this becomes expanded on reaching the Fig. 296.â€”Inner Wall op the Left Ttmpandm Natdbal Size.

In most cases the outer wall of the tympanic portion of the canal is partly fonned by fibrous tissue. The aperture by which the tendon of the muscle escapes is placed a little above and in front of the fenestra ovalis. Tlie outer boundary of the cavity is formed by the niembrana tympani (fig. 295, c), and the surrounding bone. Above and in tympani'a'^ul front of tlie membrane is the upper opening of the Glmerian fissure, iiBsure"" which is occupied in the fresli condition by the long process of one of the small hones (malleus) and some fibres of its anterior ligament, On outer bouii'lary, menibrana

DISSECTION OF THE BUAIN. 768 globus luillicUis major uiid iiuiior. Intoriiiil CttpSlllO, imrts, source of fibres ; parts—the globm pallidus major and minor. The three parts are uoiicentrically disposed from without inwards, and faint white lines indicate the separation lietwuen them. The INTERNAL CAPSULE (figs. 278 and 279) is a thick laj'er of white fibres, which is seen in the horizontal section to form a bend, or genu, (fig. 278, icg), opposite the groove between the optic thalamus and the head of the caudate nucleus. The part in front of tlie genu is named the anterior limh (ica), and the longer part behind is the posterior limb (icp) of the cjipsule. The internal capsule is formed in large part by the fibres of the crusla of the crus cerebri coursing upwards to the medullary centre of the hemi- sphere, but many fibres are added from the nuclei on each side. pyramidal tract. corp. call.- lafc. ucnt. st jjt. lu-c. caud. nucl. taenia.aemie. opt. tlial. anb. comm. int. caps, opt. tract.- coi'p.alt cluuatrunv arwif^d. nucl. Fig. 279.—Coronal Section of tde Cerebrum, passing through the Fore Part of the Third Ventricle. The Antebiok Position is Kepre- SBNTED (after MeRKEl). The pyramidal filjres, which have been traced from the medulla oblongata through the pons, and crusta, occupy the anterior two- thirds of the posterior limb. The posterior third of the posterior limb contains a few fil>res that pa.ss directly from the tegmentum, others which pass from the grey matter of the thalamus and, most posteriorly, fibres radiating the optic radiation to the anmilar and cuneate convolutions from the lower visual centres contained in the pulvinar of the optic thalamus, the external geniculate bodv and the anterior corpus (luadrigemmum. The anterior limb contains fibres which are connected with the grey matter of tlie head of the aiudale nucleus and the cortex of the frontal lobe. The fibres of the capsule are collected into

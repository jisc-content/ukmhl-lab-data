THE NASAIi NKKVE. G-15 Lima ciliarii nerves. As the iiaaal crosses llio optic nerve, it Longi-iiuiry ur<iiiclics supplies two or more ciliary branches (lig. 228,') to the eycl)iill. These lie on the inner side (jf the optic nerve, and jiiiii the ciliary branches of the lenticular ganglion. The infratrochlear branch (-) arises as the nasal nerve is "•^""'^ ..^^ to leave the cavity, and is directed forwards below the pulley of the branch! Fig. 228.—Second View of the 0 Muncles: A.

Before this branch leaves the orbit it receives an offset of communication from the supratrochlear nerve. In the nose (fig. 2i59, p. 675). Wliile in the nasal cavity the nerve Nnsni nerve furnishes brandies to the lining membrane of the septum and outer wall; and these will be subsequently referred to with the nerves of the nose (p. 677).

807 MEMBRANE OF THE TYMPANDM. cand l)y tlie anterior tympanic vessels. Crossing tlie membrane towards the upper part is the chorda tympani nerve, which issues through a special aperture close to the Glaseriau fissure. The roof (tegmen tympani ; fig. 296, tt) is a thin plate of bone Jije ™of is separating the tympanic cavity from the cranium. It occasionally perforated, presents one or more apertures, ^^•here the mucous lining of the tympanum comes into contact with the dura mater. " The floor separates the tympanum from the jugular fossa (//), Floor is and is more or less excavated by small cells, which are extensions of the tympanic cavity, and lined by a prolongation of its mucous meml)rane. An anterior wall is present only in the lower half of the .space, in fr|'i'_t is^ which it separates from the carotid canal (fc) ; in the upper half is E'|,''st,".'i°ia„ the tympanic orifice of the Eustachian tube. The fosterior wall is similarly deficient in the upper half, where Beiiind are there is a large aperture leading into a space Ciilled the antrum "^^^^^^ mastoideum (am), from which the mastoid cells are given off'. Below deum this opening, but near the inner wall, and on a level with the narrow part of the promontory, is the small conical projection of the pyramid (ptj). At the summit of the pyramid is a small pyramid, orifice, from which a canal leads backwards and downwards to the aqueduct of Fallopius: the canal lodges the stapedius muscle, witl^canal^ Sometimes there is a slender round bar of bone connecting the ° " pyramid to the promontory. Some objects that have been referred to above, viz., the mem- brana tympani, the Eustachian tube, the mastoid cells, and the secondary tympanic membrane, retjuire separate notice. The MEMBRANA TYMPANI (fig. 297) is a thin tran.sliicent '^^i^'^ ^^^'i^^^'^^^,. between the external auditory canal and the ca\dty of the tym- panum. It is rather elliptical in .shape, and its longest diameter, fo™."'"! which is directed from above down, measures al)out two-fifths of an inch. By its circumference it is attached to a groove at the inner end of the auditory passage. In the foetus it is supported attachment; by a separate osseous ring—the tympanic bone (/). The mem- brane is placed very obliquely, so that it forms an angle of about i>'«itiori ; 45° with both a horizontal and a .sagittal plane, the outer surface looking downwards and forwards. It is concave towards the J.* ^^J,'"" auditory canal, being sloped inwards from the circumference to the simped ; centre; and it projects into the cavity of the tympanum. Theni^neus^^ handle of the malleus (one of the ossicles; 6) is attached to the inner side of the membrane from tlie centre to the upper margin. Slrudure. The meuibraiie is formed of tliree strata,—externiil, internal, It consists and middle. The outer one is continuous with the integuments of the nie.itus [J,,^,,^^,"''''' auditorius ; and the inner is derived from the mucous membrane of the ,i nmc'ous, tympanum. The middle layer is formed of librous tissue, and is fixed to the andalibroua groove in the bone. From its centre, where it is Krmly united to the '">'"'• extremity of the handle of the malleus, fibres radiate towards the circum- ference ; and near the margin, at the inner aspect, lies a band of stronger circular fibres (fig. 297, c), which bridges across the notch at the upper part of the tyrapaDic bone.

Tim decussating fibres are the more numennis, and pass obliquely backwards, across the median fissure and behind the opposite anterior column, to enter the lateral column of the cord, where they constitute the crossed pyramidal trad. Upwards, the fibres of the pyramid are prolonged through the pons to the crusta of the cerebral peduncle (fig. 263, c, d).

The decmsation of tlie pyramids (fig. 263, 6) occupies the anterior lissuie of the medulla oblongata at a distance of three-quarters of an " " inch below the pons. It is about a quarter of an inch in length, and is generally constructed by the crossing of three or four bundles ot fibres from each side, but the proportion of the pyramidal fibres ™™« which decussate in the medulla varies much in difierent individuals.

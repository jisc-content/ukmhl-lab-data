When the radivi.s lias been moved over the ulna in pronation, the .short supinator comes into play to bring that bone again to the outer side of the ulna. The POSTERIOR INTEROS.SEOUS ARTERY (fig. 37, a) is an offset from the common interosseous trunk {-p. 66), and reaches the back of the forearm above the membrane between the bones. Appearing between the contiguous borders of the supinator brevis and extensor ossis metacarpi poUicis, the artery descends at first between the superficial and deep layers of muscles; and afterwards with a superficial position in the lower third of the forearm, along the tendon of the extensor carpi ulnaris as far as the wrist, where it ends by anastomosing with the carpal and anterior intero.sseous arteries. It furnishes muscular offsets to the surrounding muscles, and the following recurrent branch :— The recurrent branch (b) springs from the artery near the beginning, and ascends on or through the fibres of the supinator, but beneath the anconeus, to supply both those muscles and the elbow-joint; it anastomoses with the superior profunda artery and the recurrent radial (fig. 19, p. 46). The POSTERIOR INTEROSSEOUS NERVE (^) is derived from the musculo-spiral trunk (p. 53), and winds backwards through the fibres of the supinator brevis. Issuing from the supinator, the nerve is placed between the superficial and deep layers of muscles as far as the middle of the forearm. Much reduced in size at that spot, it sinks beneath the extensor of the second phalanx of the thumb, and runs on the interosseous membrane to the back of the carpus. Finally, the nerve enlaxges beneath the tendons of the extensor commimis digitorum, and terminates in filaments to the articulations of the carpus. Branches. It furnishes offsets to all the muscles of the deep layer, and to those of the superficial layer with the exception of the three following, viz., anconeus, supinator longus, and extensor carpi radialis longior. Kadial ARTERY AT THE WRIST (fig. 37). The radial artery (rf), with its ven£E comites, winds below the radius to the back of the carpus, and enters the palm of the hand at the first interosseous space, between the heads of the first dorsal interosseous muscle. At first the vessel lies deeply on the external lateral ligament of the wrist-joint, and beneath the tendons of the extensore of the meta- carpal bone and the first phalanx of the thumb ;' but afterwards it is more superficial, iind is cro.ssed by the tendon of the extensor of the second phalanx of the thumb. OflFsets of the musculo-cutaneous nerve entwine around the artery (p. 56), and branches of the radial nerve are superficial to it. Its branches arc numerous but inconsiderable in size :— 1. The dorsal carpal ^irfMir/i. (/) passes transversely lieneath the extensor tendons, and forms an arch {the dorsal, or posttrior, carpal arch), with a corresponding offset of the ulnar arteiy ; this arch is

BOUNDARIES AND SIZE. 437 section, the cavity is seen to be diminished in tlie middle line by the prominent spinal column, on each side of which it projects backwards Boundaries. On the sides are the ribs wit), the intercostal muscles ; Boundaries in tront is the sternum ; and behind is the spine. The base is constructed at the circumference by the last dorsal Th. vertebra behmd, by the end of the sternum in front, and by the ribs '""I'l'mgin. with their cartilages on each side; while the space included by the bones is closed by the diaphragm. The base is wider transversely than from before backwards, and form of tlie diaphragm is convex upwards towards the chest; though at certain spots it projects more than at others. Thus in the centre It is slightly lower than on each side, and is on a level with the base of the ensifonn process. On the right side, forming a dome over the liver, it rises to a level with the upper bonier of the fifth and height: rib near its junction with the cartilage ; and on the left it arches over the stomach to the corresponding part of the upper border of the si.xth rib. From the lateral projections, the diaphragm slopes suddenly towards its attachment to the ribs, but more behind than before, so as to leave an angular interval between it and the wall of the chest. The level of the attachment of the diaphragm will be it. side niarked by an oblique line, over the side of the chest, from the base ot the ens.form process to the eleventh dorsal spine ; but it differs slightly on the two side.s, being rather lower on the left The ape.x of the thoracic cavity is continued higher than the Ape:c osseous boundary, and reaches into the root of the neck Its liicrhest ^'=^'=''«' point is not in the middle line, for there the windpipe, "a3so- phagus blood-vessels and other structures lie, luit it is prolonged on each side for one or two inches above the anterior end of the first nb 80 that the apex may be .said to be bifid.

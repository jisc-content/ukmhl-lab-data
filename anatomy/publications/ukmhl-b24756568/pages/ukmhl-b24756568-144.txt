DISSECTION OF THE POPLITEAL SPACE. 128 The external branch perforates tlie intermuscular septum, and divides in the substance of the crureus. Some of the branches end in that muscle, and anastomose with the external circumflex (of the profunda) ; others descend to the joint and anastomose with the lower external articular artery; and one offset forms an arch across the front with the anastomotic artery. The internal artery, oftentimes very small, winds beneath the Popliteal arteiy Adductor ijiagnus. Upper muscular. Upper muscular. Tendou of adductor Upper internal articular. Azygos. Semimembranosus.

Two 4. The inferior articular arteries lie beneath the gastrocnemius, inferior* . but are not on the same level on opposite sides of the limb ; for the inner one descends below the internal tuberosity of the tibia, while the outer one is jjlaced above the hejvd of the fibula. Each lies beneath the lateral ligament of its own side, external; The external branch supplies the outer side of the knee-joint,

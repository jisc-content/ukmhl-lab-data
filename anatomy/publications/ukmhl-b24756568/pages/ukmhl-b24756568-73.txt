CUTANEOUS NERVES. 57 fascia to ramify on tlie vessel, ami sujiply the carpal articulations. A little above the middle of the forearm the nerve .sends back- wards a branch to the posterior aspect, which reaches nearly to the wrist, and communicates with the radial and the following cutrtneous nerve (fig. 23). The LOWER EXTERNAL CUTANEOUS BRANCH OF THE MUSCULO- external SPIRAL NERVE (p. 42) descends along the hinder part of the fore- cutaneous of spiral ; Supra acromial. Circunillex.

' ® The RADIAL NERVE ramifies in the integument of the back of radial ncrvo, the hand and some of the digits. It becomes cutaneous at the outer border of the forearm in the lower third, and, after gi\'ing some filaments to the posterior a.spect of the limb, divides into two branches (fig. 23) :— One (external) is joined by the musculo-cutaneous nerve, and is ending by distributed on the radial border and the ball of the tliumb. external and The other branch (internal) .supplies the remaining side of the internal branches,

( 41 r 207. A small branch of 206, which descends externally labovc the fifth and sixth pair of cervical nerves, and is finished under the skin, after sending otf some surculi. j 208. Another ramulus of ramus 206', descending behind the fifth and sixthjrair of cervicals, inserted into some of the jugular glands. 209. Second ramus of the exterior ramus, No. 205, which may be called the subcutaneus thoracis. 210. First branch of the subcutaneus thoracis. No. 209, which, in Its descent, anastomoses with No. 185, and is in- jcrted in the branch of the fifth or sixth pair. No. 212, and n part constitutes the rombus mentioned, No. 186. 211. 211. Division of subcutaneous nerves into 3 rami, ■vhich, with many rainuli, the greater part of which run ihovc the pectoral muscle ; the other above part of the del- ;oid under the skin, and supply the skin with many surculi ; ind also the tunica ccllulosa, and above mentioned mus- :les. 212. 212. A branch for the fifth pair of cervicals, running :o the anterior scalene muscle, anastomosing with ramus 186 ind2l0, (and thus that rhombus is formed, in part, which ve have mentioned in No. 186 and 210) running to the sub- ilavian muscloj (removed in this subject.) 213. Fifth pair of cervical nerves. 214. Nervus scapularis of Monro, or supra-scapularis of laller, which in this body arose from the fifth pair only, be- ore its combination with the sixth, otherwise proceeding rom the fifth, sixth, and seventh. 215. 215. Ramulus running from the fifth pair of phrenic lervc. I have sometimes seen the ramus arising a little lower from he conjunction of the fifth and sixth pair, descending ante- iorly and backwards, giving oft' a small branch to the subcla- ian muscle, and at last inserted into the phrenic nerve in the uperior part of the cavity of the thorax. Huber also saw uch an example, (Commentatione de Medulla Spinali, Speci- •tim dc Nervis ab ed provenientibus) Getting. 1741. §. xx. i. 50. 216. Conjunction of the fifth pair with the sixth. 217. 217. Sixth pair of cervical nerves. 218. Raiuus running to the pectoral muscle drawn back 'ards. 219. 219. Seventh pair of cervical nerves. 220. Communication of the seventh pair with the sixth air.

Conjunction of the eighth pair of cervicals with Ike first dorsal. i 225. Ramus ascending from nerve 224 to the nerve of the 'tftb pair. ^226. 226. Another branch of nerve^2?4 running pectoral muscle. * 227. 227. Third ramus of nerve 224, which anastomoses^ with ramus 221, and is then inserted with it into the ser- ratus anticus & serratus magnus. 228. Nervus cutaneus intemus arising from nerve 224. 229- Ramus of nerve 224 ascending obliquely to ramus of the seventh pair, and Aidth it constituting the nervus me- dianus. 230. A tenaculum drawing the trunk of the eighth pair to the right. 231. A branch from the fifth pair, emerging through the interstice of the second and third cauda of the muscle scale- nus with another. 232. Branch from the sixth pair of cervicals going out in a similar manner, but between the first and second cauda of the scalenus, and with the third. 233. Small branch from the sixth pair which runs through the first cauda of the above-mentioned muscle, uniting and forming No. 55, descending to the second lateral ganglion of the neck. No. 54. 234. A small branch running from the common trunk of No. 231, 232, 233, to the longus colli. 235. Capitulum majus of the first rib. 236. of the second rib, 237. Second pair of dorsal nerves. 238. Nervus pharyngeus of the eighth pair of cerebral nerves, sometimes the inferior branch of the glosso-pharyn- gaus nerve. 239. 240. 241. Three of its small branches running into the middle constrictor muscle of the pharynx 242. Its fourth branch inserted in the stylo-pharyngeus muscle. 243. Ninth pair of cerebral nerves, called lingual, 244. A nerve descending from the ninth pair, which meets the nerve descending 245. From the second. No. 156, and third pair of cervicals, and joining with it, forms the ansa communication is No. 244, 245, of the ninth pair of nerves of the cerebral with the second and third pair of cervical nerves. , 246. Left ramus running from the inferior part of the ansa Communications to the superior subutance of the coraco-hyoi- deus muscle. 247. Right branch arising from the inferior part of the ansa communications, and inserted into the interior substance of the coraco-hyoideus muscle: (but this ramus, with the inferior substance, is cut off.) 248 6c 249. Two middle branches soon uniting, and thus forming a triangular space. 250. A branch from the coalesced ramuli, No. 248 & 249, which descending a little (Hi the left, is inserted with many ramuli

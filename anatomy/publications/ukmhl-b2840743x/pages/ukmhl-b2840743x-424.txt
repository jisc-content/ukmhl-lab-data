( ufi ) ) SYSTEM OF THE PULMONARY ARTERIES AND VEINS. The pulmonary artery arises from the right ventricle of the heart, going straight upwards, and, immediately after, passing out of the pericardium, is divided into two branches: 1. The right branch for the right lobe of the lungs. 2. The left branch for the left lobe of the lungs. Both these branches, when in the substance of the lungs, are divided into innumerable small branches, like a net- work, distributed upon the air vesicles, and termi- nating in the pulmonary veins. The pulmonary veins arise from the extremities of the pulmo- nary arteries,’ and finally terminate in four branches, which empty themselves into the left venous sinus of the heart, or left auricle. OF VEINS IN GENERAL. Veins are long membranous canals, which gradually widen, and carry the blood towards the heart; they do not pulsate. THE ORIGIir OF VEINS IS DOUBLE: 1. From the extremities of arteries, by anastamosis. 2. From the external and internal surface of the whole body, by absorbent veins. The termination of veins is into the sinuses of the heart, or 1. The vena cava, terminates in the right. 2. The pulmonary veins terminate in the left sinus of the ^ heart. THE SHAPE OF VEINS Is like that of arteries, dividing into branches. THE SUBSTANCE Of veins consists of three membranes, which arc thinner than the coats of arteries.—Some have tosserled, that they have line muscular tunic. THE VALVES OF VEINS Ave semilunar membranes, which prevent the reflux of of blood into the arteries. USE. ” To return the blood from all parts of the body to the heart: and to convey those subtile fluids from the internal and external surface of the body, w hich are not absorbed by tlie lymphatic absorbent system.—For proofs of which, read Ab. Kaaw, Haller, and ilcckcll. BRANCHES OF THE VENA CAVA. The vena cava gives off the superior and inferior. THE BRANCHES OF THE VENA CAVA, SUPERIOR,^ ARE The subclavian veins, external jugular, internal, vena azygos. THE BRANCHES OF THE EXTERNAL JUGULAR ARE The frontal, angular, temporal, auricular, sublingual, occipital. THE BRANCHES OF THE INTERNAL JUGULAR, ARE The lateraljsinuses of the dura mater, laryngeal, and pharyngeal veins. THE BRANCHES OF THE VENA AZYGOS ARE The vertebral, intercostal, bronchial, diaphragmatic. THE BRANCHES OF THE SUBCLAVIAN ARE I The mammary, axillary. THE BRANCHES OF THE .\X1LLARY ARE The brachial, cephalic, basilic, median, salvatella. cephalica pollicis. digital. THE BRANCHES OF THE INFERIOR VENA CAVA ARE The hepatic, renal. right spermatic, lumbar, sacral, iliac. THE ILIAC VEINS ARE Divided into the internal and external iliac. THE BRANCHES OF THE INTERNAL ARE The obturator, pudendal. external haemorroidal. the

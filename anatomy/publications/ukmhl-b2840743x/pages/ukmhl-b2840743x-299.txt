240. Anastomosis of the posterior superior reiial nerve, with nerve, 262, and nerve, 263.—We shall see this anastomosis better expressed in Plate XXXVII. 241. Anastomosis of nerve, 239, with the inferior posterior renal nerve, 239, coming from nervus anastomosis, .62. 242. 242. Posterior inferior renal nerve, arising from the trunk of the great sympathetic nerve, 62. 243. 243. Ramus anastomoticus of the inferior posterior renal nerve, with nerve 239» 241. 244. Anastomosi.s of the inferior posterior renal nerve with the first renal ganglion, 252. -245. 245. Conjunction of the posterior superior with the posterior inferior renal nerve into one common trunk.— This common trunk is joined with 246. 247; The second renal ganglion, 253, then disperses, 248. 248. Surculi, to the renal artery, in its further progress on the posterior surface of the artery.—^The root is divided into three rami; viz. 249' 250. Two rami anastomotlci with surculi, coming from the renal ganglion; and 251. 251. A third, which is terminated on the posterior sur- face of that renal artery in the muscular membrane. 252. First right renal ganglion. 253. Second. 254. Third. 255. Fourth. 1256. Anastomosing nerve, between the first and second gang- lion. 1257. Anastomosing nerve, between the first and third gang- lion. 259. Anastomosis, between the second and fourth renal ^ ganglion. 260. Anastomosing nerve, between nerve 267, and 258. 261. .Anastomosis of the third with tire fourth renal gang- lion.. 262. Anastomosis of the third renal- ganglion with nerve 240. 263. Anastomosis, between the fourth renal, ganglion, and posterior renal ramus, 240. 264. Anastomosing ramus, between the second right renal ganglion, Plate XXXVII. 253 ; and first coeliac ganglion, Plate XXXVII. 1.—When the second renal ganglion gives the above-mentioned rami, it is changed into n 265. A long, and sufficiently thick renal anterior nerve, from which arises 266. A bifid ramus; of this, 267. One surculus is distributed on the posterior surface of the renal artery, t 268. The other is larger, and anastomosing with nerve 249. —The remaining trunk of the anterior renal nerve gives on the anterior surface of the renal artery. 269. An internal superior spermatic nerve, from which arise three rami,. Is* 270. 270. 270. The first ramus migrates to. the renal artery, and immediately 271. 271. 272. Dividing into two, or other rami, passes to- the posterior surface of the renal capsule, where ' 273. 273. 273. It terminates in the vascular substance of the kidney. ' 274. Second ramus, anastomosing with nerve, 250. 275. &c. &c. Third ramus of the superior spermatic nerve, is spermatic, strictly so called.—This ramus passes as rami^ 273 and 274, before the renal artery, then descending a little is joined with 276. A ramus of the anterior renal nerve, sends 277. to 279- Surculi, which, after having anastomosed with 279> run with the renal arteries to the anterior surface of the capsule.—It also distributes 281. 281.282. Superior ureteric nerves, which are termimated in the internal, or nervous membrane of the ureter.—Now the internal superior spcnnaticus 283. 283. Forms an elegant anastomosis, which running down in a transverse direction, before the vena cava enters- the internal superior spermatic with the first inferior sper * matic : at length the internal superior spermatic nerve, accompanied by the spermatic artery, runs down to the uterus; the further progress of which, on account of its minuteness, could not be represented. 284. 284, 284. Third ramus of the anterior renal nerve, 265, runs down before the renal artery, gives a ramus anas- tomosis with internal superior spermatic nerve, 276,exhibits 285. A surculus to the renal pelvis, and terminates with ra^ muli of the renal artery in the kidney. 286. Fourth ramus of the anterior renal nerve is divided into three. 287. to 289. Rami^ which run with the rami of the renal artery to the kidney ; of which the one that is marked, 288, 290. Anastomoses with 271. 29J. 291. Fourth ramus of the posterior renal nerve, runs down as the others, with the rami of the renal artery. 292. P'irst right spermatic ganglion., 293. Second 294. to 296. Nerve, anastomosing between the first renal ganglion, 252, and first right spermatic ganglion.—On ac- count of the elegant figure of the laqueus, or nervous ansa, which comprehends the right inferior spermatic- artery : it should be called Ansa Spermatica. 297. 297. First anastomosing branch of the great sympathe- tic nerve with the nervus anastomoticus. 29s. 298. Second anastomosing branch, between the greab sympathetic nerve, and ansa spermatica,. 299.. 299.

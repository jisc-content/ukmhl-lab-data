( ) THE ORBITS. SITUATION. Under the forehead, at the sides of the root of the nose. SHAPE, Conoid. DIVISION. Into entrance, and fundus. The entrance is divided into the superior margin. inferior. external angle, and internal, which are likewise called canthi. CAVITIES IN THE ORBIT ARE 1. A fovea for the lachrymal gland, at the external angle. 2. A fovea for the orbital trochlea, at the internal angle. 3. The lachrymal fossa for the lachrymal sac. 4. The nasal canal, which is a continuation of the lachry- mal fossa, going, obliquely, into the nostrils, where it opens under the inferior spongy bone, 5. The superior orbital rima, or rim. 6. inferior. 7. superciliary foramen. 5. infra-orbital canal. 9. optic foramen. THE ORBIT IS FORMED BY SEVEN BONES. 1. By the frontal, at its upper part. 2. maxillary, and jugal, at the inferior part. 3. lachrymal, ethmoid, and palatine inwardly. 4. sphoenoid outwardly, and at its fundus. USE. To contain and defend the eye, and its appendages. .CAVITY OF THE NOSE. SITUATION. Under the fore part of the skull, in the middle of the face. DIVISION. By a bony septum into a right and left cavity. SHAPE. Pyramidal. THE PROTUBERANCES ARE 1. The septum narium, which is formed by the vomei', and a perpendicular lamina of the ethmoid bone. 2. Three pair of .spongy bones; namely, superior, and middle, which are portions of the ethmoid bone j the inferior, which are separate. THE CAVITIES ARE 1. Three pair of pituitary sinuses; namely, The frontal in the frontal bone. The sphoenoid in the sphofenoid bone. The maxillary, which are likewise called HighmoFs Antrum in the maxillary bone. 2. The anterior nasal foramina, formed by the maxillary bones, and the vomer. 3. The posterior nasal foramina, formed by the palatine bones, and vomer. COMPOSITION OF THE NOSE. â€™ It is formed by thirteen bones: 1. By the fr-ontal, 2. two maxillary. 3. tw'o nasal. 4. tw'o lachrymal. 5. tw'o inferior, spongy. 6. the sphoenoid. 7. the vomer. . 8. the ethmoid, g. two palatine. trsE. To form the organ of smell; and pituitary sinus of the nose. CAVITY OF THE MOUTH. SITUATION, Between the superior and inferior maxillary bones. SHAPE. Anteriorly oval; posteriorly transversely semi-oval. DIVISION. Into upper and lower maxillary, or bones. COMPOSITION. It is forrhed from five bones, and thirty-two teeth: by two superior maxillary ; by two palatine; and by the lower jaw. USE. For mastication, and other purposes. THE TEETH. They are small bones, fixed in the alveoli of the maxillary, or jaw-bones. Number, commonly thirty-two are found, sixteen in each jaw. DIVISION INTO THREE SPECIES. The four middle are called incisorcs ; one on each side of these, which are called canini; ten others, the molares, or grinders, which are situated beyond the canini. DIVISION.

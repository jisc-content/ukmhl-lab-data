XXXVI HISTORY OF medicine: bwk Dc Superftttatione, he recommends boiled puppies to be eaten by women, to promote conception. In Lib. dc Intemis Affcctionibvs, he directs the same to be used as food, by dropsical patients, and in an hepatites, alter the disease is brought to a crisis. It may be worthy of observation, that puppies were considered rather as a delicacy in China, Asia, and Africa; and Pliny says, (1) the Romans used them as other aliments. DELIRIUM, CONVULSIONS, AND COMATOSE SYMPTOMS. A CONVULSION and delirium occasioned by too much watching, is bad. (m) Convulsions, and vehement pains about the bowels, in acute fevers, are bad. (n) A difficulty of breathing, and dcliriunt in continual fevers, are mortal, (o) If those that are in health be suddenly taken with the hcad-ach, and thereupon become presently dumb, and snore, (j>} they die within seven days, unless a fever come upon them. We ought likewise to observe, what of the eyes appear in sleep; (q) for if any of the white appear, the eye-lids not being close shut, unless it proceed from a flux of the belly, or ' a purging potion, it is a bad sign, and very pernicious. Deliriums attended with laughter, arc more safe^ (r) but those that come by too much study, are more dangerous. . In the continual fever, if either the eye-brow, or nose, be distorted ; (s) if the sick sec not, or hear not, it any of these ■ symptoms appear, death is approaching. He likewise draws conclusions from expectoration and the foeces, (t) and makes several observations, of slow fevers pro- , ducing pains and sweUings in the joints. (x) INTERMITTENTS. HE observes, that quartan agues are, for the most part, of short duration, in summer; (x) but the autumnal, long; and especially those commencing near the winter. j Those intermittent fevers, are hard to be removed, (y) when the paroxysm returns the next day, at the same time it left J the patient the day before. j The fourth day is the index of the seventh; the eighth the beginning of the week following, (z) But the eleventh day | is to be considered; for that is the fourth day or another seventh, (a) And again, the seventeenth is to be considered, 1 being the fourth from the fourteenth, and the seventh from the eleventh, j In the beginning of diseases, if there should be a cause for removing any thing, move it; (b) but when they are advanced, 1 it is much better to leave them alone. ^ , Those fevers which happen every day, are daily dissolved; (c) but with great difficulty cured, ' In intermitting fevers, if a lip, nose, eye, or eye-brow be distorted; or if the sick cannot hear; if these symptoms appear; then is death approaching. Hippocrates, in his method of curing intermitting fevers, or quartan agues, (d) first purged downward; and if the disorder continued, he bathed them in warm water; and on coming out of the bath, gave his patients the seeds of henbane, and mandrake, the quantity of one grain of millet seed each, lasserpitium and trefoil, each the quantity of three beans steeped in wine. If a fever arose, from the fatigue of a journey, to the robust, and afterwards proved intermittent; he ordered garlic and honey, lentil broth, in which was honey and vinegar. After the sick had taken this moss, he made them vomit; and after having birthed them in a hot bath, when cool, they drank ciccon water, and in the evening, light diet, as much as their stomachs would bear. Afterward, he ordered them to be covered with an abundance of clothes, and by that (i) Lib. 23. (ni) Aph. 18 Sect VII. (0) Aph. 60. Sect. IV. Judicat. VIII. 17. Pra;not IV. 20. XVI. 9. (g) Prsenot.

Here the branch, (No. 40) divides into 4 ramuli, of which 45, 4(J, two run down between the pulmonary artery and trachea, to the left sinus, and even surface of the heart. 47. The third small branch of No. 40, runs above the right pulmonary artery, and then divides into the third ramuli. 48. The internal ramulus of branch 47, forming the third surculi, going to the right auricle. 49. 49. The middle ramulus of No. 47, which, after giving a surculus to the right auricle, ascends to the lateral internal, and then external surface of the vena cava: inflecting a little forwards (Vieussens, plate 23, No. 12. 12. 12) has delineated a small ring, formed by the par vagum surrounding the vena cava where, the rami vieussenii are joined to the branch 49, this subject only. It 50. The third and external small branch of No, 47, distri- 11 buted on the surface of the right pulmonary artery. 51. 51. The fourth branch of No, 40, which, soon after its !( origin, divides into two, and runs down with 44, 45, 46', be- lt tween the pulmonary artery and trachea, to the left sinus. 52. The superficial ramus, from the inferior cervical gan- n|glion, (No. 33) which running above the subclavian artery, surrounds it, and re-ascending behind No. 57, where it is in- ,;j serterl into the first dorsal ganglion, (No. 6'C.) This in its course forms the ansa, as described by Vieussens, ji 53. 54. A deep-seated branch from the inferior cervfcal .’I gitnglion to the first dorsal, or the trunk of the cervical in- tcrcostal nerve, going towards the outside, and. backwards . from the inferior cervical ganglion, under the vertebral artery Jto the first dorsal ganglion; in this subject it consisted of two very evident ganglia. 53 and 54; this trunk, with the ibranches 52, 56', forms those ansa;, including the subclavian artery. 55. A branch formed from ramuli of the fifth pair of cer- Ifccals, No. 231; and of the sixth. No. 232, 233, which descends above the vertebral artery to the seconu lateral ganglion, No. 54, and is inserted into it. ■ 55. A branch from the second" lateral ganglion. No. 54, de- scending above the subclavian artery, and carried round it is inserted into the posterior surface of the second branch 52) thus the second ansa of Vieussens was found in this body. 57. The conjunction of the branches 52 and 56, consti- tuting a common part of both ansae. 58. Another small branch running from the second lateral ganglion, No. 54, going to the smallest scalenus muscle, in this subject concealed under the letters e e. 59. Another small branch of the second lateral ganglion, (No. 54) descending to the ganglion. No, 88, behind the sub- clavian artery. 60. The first, or great dorsal ganglion, called by some the superior thoracic ganglion. 61. 61. A thicker branch, which arises from the sixth pair of cervicals emerging from between the scaleni muscles, and goes to the first dorsal ganglion. 62. 63. Two branches from the eighth pair of cervicals, de- scending between the scalenus minimus aeidjongus colli to the superior thoracic ganglion. 64. A branch from the first pair of dorsal nerves ascending to the superior thoracic ganglion, (or, rice versa) descending from the thoracic ganglion to the first pair of dorsal nerves, 65. 65. A branch running down from the first dorsal gan- glion to the truncus anonymus, wliere it is joined with branch No. 25. 66. 66. 66. A very thick branch, twice the diameter of the former, descending from the first dorsal ganglion to the cardiac plexus, forming, in this cadaver, the principal nerve of that plexus: first, it descends as a companion of 65, but at some distance from the arteria innoininaia, inflects a little, but above the trachea it passes in a straight direction, and at last subdivides into three branches, No. 69. 73. 85 ; but it must be observed, that the superior part-of this nerve, on account of the arch of the aorta and trachea being drawn to the left, is very much distended, and removed from its natural situation. 67. 67. A small branch going from the second lateral gan- glion, (No. 54) to the ramus. No. 66, in its descent. 68. The insertion of a thick branch. No. 141, from |he re- current of. the. eighth pair into the principal cardiac’nerve,. (No. 66.) 69. 69. Internal ramus- of nerve, No. 66, which’, running down on the loft side, enters the branch, No. 131 & No. 129,' and afterwards, in part, carried backwards round these bran- ches, it ascends, principally, to the posterior surface of the arch of the aorta, dispersing into several surculi. 70. 70. 70. 70. Surculi of ramus 69, conspicuous in tho posterior surface of the arch of the aorta. 71. A ramulus of the branch 69, distributed in. the inter-- nal lateral surface of the arch of the aorta. 72. Another ramulus of branch 69, running between the aorta and right pulmonary artery, then dividing into two parts, extends to the left amide below the common triurk of tho pul- monary artery. 73. Middle, branch of the principal cardiac nerve, (No. 66) which running a little lower, divides into two small branches,- viz. No. 74 & 79* U 74. Left

The causes of nervous sympathy are rendered manifest liow one ramification, or filament, may affect another, and convey sensations grateful'or ungrateful to the brain, and int< lectual powers. Tife cannot exist without the nerves influencing the heart, lungs, and diaphragm—to perform their involtt tary actions, in conjunction with air, the muscles of the chest, &c. The nervous powers proceeding to those vital parts br“ totally impeded—death must immediately ensue. •>'V - Tivr’ '1

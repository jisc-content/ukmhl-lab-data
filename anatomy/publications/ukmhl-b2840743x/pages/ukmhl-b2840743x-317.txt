Nerves, arising from the second right sperma- tic ganglion, 126, and third, 140, are those which contri- bute to compose the inferior mesenteric plexus of the great sympathetic nerve on the left side, 173. to 174. Rami hypogastrici, arising from the second left ^ spermatic ganglion, 126, 175. Nervus hypogastricus, for the most part composed of rami, 315, 352, 166. 176. Nervus hypogastricus, arising from rami of the inferior mesenteric plexus, J78, to 182. Rami hypogastrici of the inferior mesenteric plexus. Thus, from rami of the great sympathetic nerve of the right and left side, this is from nerves 322, 337, 329, 175, 176, 17s, 179> 181, 182, the rami hypogastrici are com- posed, which, by various anastomoses, like net-work, at length, dividing into two fasciculi, they, by the following. 183, 184, to 187, are carried to the right side of the lowest part of the colon and rectum, to meet rami coming from the hypogastric plexus, o, 8, Plate XXXVI.

Are those rami which run to the left side of the lowest part of the colon and rectum, as in a similar man- ner with the right rami, they contribute to form the plexus hypogastricus. From all, and almost every single spermatic ganglion of the right and leftside, a reticular nervous structure is formed. S. S. The inferior mesenteric plexus, the elegance of which cannot be described: it is an immense number of neiwes, which 198. to 201. Arise from the rete nervosum, which continu- ally surrounds the continued trunk of the inferior mesente- ric artery. 202. to '205. Elegant nerves follow, and in a kind of space between two branches of the inferior mesenteric artery. 206. to 212. The nerves are placed very numerous, which, at length, from 213, to 276, are carried, in general, to the colon.—Hence, it is evident, how much nervous influence is possessed by the colon. Among the other nerves sent from the inferior mesenteric plexus, the following 277. to 28. Branches should be mentioned : the nerves which anastomosing w'ith the superior mesenteric surculi, contri- bute to form the celebrated superior mesenteric plexus. How wonderful is the structure of tlie Nervous System 1 !-^How satisfactory do the various minute ramifications, anastomising connections, account for the diversity and extent of all the symptoms of disease, that afiiict human beings! Without this Science, it would be impossible to conceive the prototype form of symptoms; without knowing that all the trunks, branches, minute ramifications, and minutest surculi, or nervous twigs, communicate with one another: and, lastly, with the sensorium commune, from which all sensations originate—we could neither feci, the pain of disease, not could we have sense to seek for remedies. . - } '>..1 11 0 S' 1 ? \

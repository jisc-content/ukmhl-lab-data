xllv HISTORY OF MEDICINE. COUGHS, CONSUMPTIONS, AND OTHER DISEASES OF THE THORAX, TO young people, happen spitting of blood; foj consumptions; acute fevers; the falling sickness; and ofher disorder# but these of the lungs in particular, (p) Those w'ho have passed their youtli, are subject to asthmas, (q) pleurisies, inflammations of the lungs, lethargies, phrenzies, burning fevers, &c. and a consumption most commonly happens, between the age of eighteen, and thirty-five, (s} Those who cough up frothy blood, bring it from the lungs. (t) After vomiting blood follows a consumption and a throwing up of corrupted matter. (uj Those things that dispose a man naturally to a consumption are all violent, fx) But that succeeds very well, which throws a patient into a sickness, (y) at a. time when the very season itself is a remedy, to a particular sickness ; as the summer to a burning fever, and the winter to a dropsy, (z) For that which arises from nature always prevails, though low spirited persons are more terrified by it. (a) In consump- tive persons, if, what they cough up, on being thrown into the fire it smells very foetid, (b) and at the same time, if there should be a falling off of tlie hair, the disorder will prove fatal; (c) and if a diarrhoea happens to consumptive persons, who have their hair falling off, it is mortal. (dj Spitting of corrupt matter, after spitting of blood, is bad ; fej for after spitting of corruption, follows a consumption, and diarrhoea; and when the discharge upwards, or the expectoration ceases, the patient dies, (fj Those who have a pleurisy, unless the matter is evacuated upwards, within fourteen days, will have their disease terminate in an abscess. Cg) Those who have got an abscess, f/ij or imposthume, by a pleurisy, if the matter is evacuated upwards in forty days, after the bursting of the abscess, they will be cured ; otherwise they will fall into a consumption. After a pleurisy, an inflammation of the lungs is bad ; (ij and a phrenzy succeeding an inflammation of the lungs is very unfavourable. In the peripneumony, he ordered an electuary of pine apples, galbanum, and attic honey and ptisan, (h) In the consumption, Hippocrates purged with the berries of thymelaea or sparge, and afterward recommended asses milk, â– whey, or milk of cows, goals, marcs, and a little salt was added to make the milk prove gently laxative. He likewise burnt the patients in the back and breast, and several other parts, and kept the ulcers open for some time. He gave the squils likewise, but would not permit vomits to be taken in a consumption. As diet he recommended goats flesh, pork, and to pro- mote expectoration, fat meats, in order to discharge the purulent matter. Besides these he ordered moderate exercise, air, and walking. The general methods of treating the peripneumonies pleurisy, and other acute diseases, have been already treated of. OF THE DIARRHCEA, DYSENTERY, AND REMARKS OF THE APPEARANCE OF THE FCECES. In evacuations, by the intestines, (1) changes of the excrements are good; unless they change for the worse. If a diarrheea happen to those, who, (m) before have had their hair falling off, by a consumption, it is a mortal sign, (n) And an immediat# (o) Coac. III. 260. Aph. 29. Sect. III.

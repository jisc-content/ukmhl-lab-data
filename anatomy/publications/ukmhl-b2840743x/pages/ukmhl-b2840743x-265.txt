I ( 39 J 120. 120. Fourth ratuiilus, from ramus 94, which extends on the left towards the trachea, running on its posterior surface. 121. 121. Fifth ramulus of ramus 9^, proceeding behind the trachea to the oesophagus. 122. A branch' from the par vagum, running to form ra- : mus No. 121. ! 123. Last ramulus of ramus 9-l> which is inserted into the par vagum. 124. A ramulus, arising from the par vagum, which Soon subdivides into 3 ramuli, and is inserted into the posterior surface of the trachea. 125. Another ramus from the par vagum, inserted into the oesophagus behind the trachea. 126 & 127. Two rami from the par vagum, (a little below the origin of the recurrent) before inserted into the oesopha- gus ; but arc here represented cut off, on account of the par vagum being drawn to the right side. 128. A ramus, running from the inferior cervical ganglion of the left side, which descends behind the subclavian artery and arch of the aorta. 129. 129- Its ramus, which after running on the right, spreads between the aorta and right pulmonary artery, and at length is inserted into No. 84. In other bodies I have always observed a different distribu- tion of the branch 128, other courses of the ramuli; and, lastly, another anastomosis with those of the right side. 130. 130. Another ramulus of No. 128, which bends round the left side of the aorta between it and the pulmonary artery. Tunning towards the anterior part of the aorta. 131. Ramulus, running from the recurrent nerve of the left side, and stretching between the arch of the aorta, and the right pulmonary artery forms, 132. Which proceeds above the right pulmonary artery, in- serted into it by 3 surculi. 133. But another ramus of branch 131, descends a little, and towards the end is divided into a ramulus. 134. Which is united with a surculus of No. 80. 135. Another small branch from 133, which, with the sur- culus of No. 80, descends to the left sinus. Yet I have fre- quently been unable to find No. 133, 134, 135, after very mi- nute investigations. 136’. A ramus which I found in this body only, running near the left side of the aorta, between that and the trunk of the pulmonary artery from the left cardiac (and even from a branch of the superior cervical ganglion) to this great plexus : but first it forms 137. A smalt branch, accompanying No. 72, to the left sinus. Then, No. 136, proceeding further on the right, sends off another ramulus, 138. Which is inserted into No. 112- 139. 139. Lastly, the third ramulus, descending with No. Ill, and No. 48, to the light ear. 140. 140. A branch arising from the left cardiac, accom- panying ramus 78, with which it descends under the arch of the aorta to the left sinus. 141. Third branch arising (fora the recurrent nerve of the eighth pair. No. 93, which, under No. 66, is insertedintq the principal cardiac nerve. No. 66, arising from the first thoracic ganglion. . / 142. Fourth descending branch from the recurrent, anas- tomosing with No. 99* < 143- A branch ascending from the recurrent. . ' 144. 145. Two of pts surculi inserted in the sterno-thyrold muscle, lit. T. 146. A third small branch of 143 ascending towards the larynx. 147. Another branch from the recurrent, which ascends under the same to the larynx. 148. 148. The accessory nerve of Willis, or superior re- current nerve of the 8th pair, perforating the sterno and cleido-mastoid muscles. 149. 149. The same nerve again emerging from the stemo and cleido-mastoid muscles, and descending further to the cucullaris muscle. » 150. Ramulus, which recedes in the sterno and cleido- mastoid muscles, from the trunk of the accessory nerve, and. after branching out several ramuli into these muscles, again emerges separately, and is ultimately connected with the ac- cessory nerve. 151. Anterior branch of the first pair of cervical nerves, which, after sending off ramulus, No. 2, to the great cervical ganglion, communicates with the second pair. Its inferior part is thinner than usual- 152. 152. Anterior ramus of the second pair, which de- scends with two ramuli. No. 4 and 5, inserted into the great cervical ganglion. , 153. Its first ramulus, which gives 154. A surculus to the rectus anticus-major muscle of the head, let. d ; then descending lower is 155. Inserted wdth its small trunk into the third pair of cervical nerves. 156. Second ramulus of the nerve 152, running to the ansa of communication between the cervical nerves with the ninth pair of nerves of the cerebrum. 157. Third ramulus of nerve 152, inserted into the formed s, trunk of the third pair. 158. Fourth ramulus of nerve 152, communicating with No. 183 of the third pair, 159. Fifth ramulus of nerve 152, passing to the posterior- auricular nerve, No. 189- 160. Sixth ramulus of nerve 152, which forms 161. A surculus to the great posterior auricular nerve, No. 189; hut by 162. Its remaining part is inserted into the accessory nerve of Willis. 163. Seventh ramulus of nerve 152, also inserted into the accessory nerve. 164. Lastly, the eighth branch joined to the same accessory nerve, but a little higher. 165. Trunk of the third-pair of cervical nerves, or its first branch.—For the proportion of the former branch of the third

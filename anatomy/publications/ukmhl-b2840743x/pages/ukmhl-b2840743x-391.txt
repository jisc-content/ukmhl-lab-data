G g a ■ SHAPE. ( »^3 ) DIVISION. Into internal and external surface, body, and four apophyses. THE PROTUBERANCES ARE 1. The frontal apophysis, which is connected to the frontal bone at the external angle of the orbit. 2. The orbital apophysis, forming a part of the orbit. 3. The cheek apophi/sis, which is near the maxillary bone. The zygomatic apophyses, which are connected to the zygoma- tlcprocess of the temporal bone, and forms the zygoma. TUE CAVITIES ARE / 1. The zygomatic cavity behind. CONNECTION WITH FOUR BONES; NAMELY, 1. With the frontal. 2. maxillary, 3. sphenoid. 4. temporal. BONES OF THE NOSE. SITUATION. In the superior part, and middle of the nose. SHAPE. Oblong square. DIVISION. Into external, and internal surtace, and four margins ; 1. Superior, near the frontal bone. 2. Inferior, connected with the cartilage of the nose. 3. Internal, by which it is united to its companion; and below, it rests upon the perpendicular apophysis of the ethmoid bone. 4. External, meets the nasal apophysis of the maxillary bone. CONNECTION WITH FOUR BONES. 1. With its associate. 2. the froiital. 3. maxillary. 4. ethmoid. USE. To form the nose, and to defend and cover the organ of smelling. LACHRYMAL BONES. SITUATION. In the internal corner of the orbit, SHAPE. Almost square, DIVISION. Into external and internal surface, and four margins; 1. The superior, connected with the frontal bone. 2. The inferior, joined to the maxillary. 3. The internal, joined to the papyraceous apophysis of the ethmoid bone. 4. The external, joined to the nasal apophysis of the max- illary bone. CAVITY. A middle furrow at the external margin, which, in con- junction with the middle groove of the nasal apophysis of the maxillary bone, forms the lachrymal fossa. CONNECTION WITH FOUR BONES. 1. With the frontal. 2. maxillaiy. 3. ethmoid. , 4. inferior, spongy. USE. Forms part of the orbit of the lachrymal duct, and defends the organ of hearing. SOSA SPONGIOSA INFERIORA, or INFERIOR SPONGY BONES. SITUATION. At the side, and inferior part of the nose. SHAPE. Spiral. DIVISION. Into external surface, which is depressed towards the max- illary sinus. The interna! surface is convex, towards the nose. Two margins; the superior adheres to the transverse eminence of the maxillary bone. The inferior hangs un- connected in the cavity of the nose, and has an anterior and posterior extremity. connection with three bones, bt harmony; NAMELY, 1. With the maxillary bone. 2. palatine. 3. lachrymal. USE. To extend the surface of the organ of smelling, and diminish the extent of Highnior’s antrum. PALATINE BONES. situation. In the posterior part of the nose, and extend literally as for as the orbit.

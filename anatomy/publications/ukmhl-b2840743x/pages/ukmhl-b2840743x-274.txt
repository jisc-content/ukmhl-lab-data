( 46 ) 93- 93. 9^- Four small branches of the nervus pharjm- jeus, dispersed in the middle constrictor muscle of the pharynx, and in the stylo-phuryngeus. 97. Fifth ramulus of the pharyngciis, inserted into the aervus mollis^ accompanying the labial artery. 98« ninth pair, or lingual nerves. 99- A small branch of the anterior branch of the first pair, joined to it by anastomosis.—(Vide No. 5.) 100. Descending branch of the ninth, forming two ansae, with the cervical nerves in this body. 101. Branch of the ninth running down to the hyo-thryoid muscle. 102. 102. Two small branches of the ninth pair, proceed- ing to the cerato-glossus. 103. 104. 105. Three small branches interwoven with the basio-glossus muscle by many filaments. 106. 107. Two small branches of the ninth, terminated in the genio-glossus. lOS. A small branch of the same ninth, which forms ana- stomosis, after giving off" the filamentum basio-glossum, with the ramulus of the third lingual branch of the fifth pair. 109. A branch running to the genio-glossus. 110. Another, forming an anastomosis with the lingual nerve. 111. The remainder of the ninth pair under the sublingual gland, partly communicating with the lingual of the fifth, partly distributed in the genio-glossus muscle. 112. A small part of the par vagum; the larger part is removed. 113. A branch of it going to the anterior ramus of the second pair of ccrvicals. 114. The laryngcal nerve of the eighth pair. 115. A branch of the same, running to the nerve. No. 124.—(Vide No. 125.) 116. 117. 11s. 11.0- 120. 121. Separation of the same into two larger, and four smaller ramifications. 116. The lowest and largest branch of the nervus laryn- gcus, or the trunk, which descends urwler the hyo-thyroid muscle a little before the superior process of the thyroid car- tilage, to the interior part of the laryiux, anteriorly. 117- Superior branch, thicker tlian tlie others, which sends off many surculi under the hyo-thyroid muscle, above the in- ternal surface of the meiiibrana-crassa of Morgagni, (ex- ■panding between the os-hyoides, and thyroid cartilage) but the other part rises under the right cornu of that bone. 118. 119- 120. 121. Four intermediate smaller branches diffused under the hyo-thyroid muscle in the exterior surface of the membrane of Morgagni. 122- A ramification from the anterior branch of the great cervical ganglion, running backwards almost in a direct line, which, with 123. The fourth anterior branch of the same ganglion, forms 124. 124. A ramification, rather reddish, running ob- liquely, and anteriorly behind the carotid arteries. 125. Combination of the same with No. 115; and again, its seperation into two. No. 141 and 147- 126. Anterior branch, which running farther in the di- rection of No. 139, passes under the coraco-hyoid, or sterno- thynoid muscles, to the crico-thyroid. 127. A surculus of the same, migrating to the thyroid gland. This surculus, like No. 128, 129, 130, 131, is^ marked by a dot. 128. A ramification of nerve. No. 126, entering the lar} nx under the inferior margin of the thyroid cartilage, to be distributed on its internal surface. 129. 130. 131. Three other surculi that supply the crico- thyroidcus. 132. Posterior branch of conjunction. No. 125, which 133. Gives a surculus to the inferior constrictor muscle, and to a part of the same, arising from the cricoid carti- lage. 134. The remaining part, No. 132, descending under the common carotid artery, from which also a surculus runs to the thyroid gland. 135. The reddish gangliform ramification, which arises from No. 124, behind the external carotid artery, and directs its course on the anterior side of this artery to the e-\ternal surface. ' 136. Here the same nerve, after taking up ramulus, No, 78, and 84, from the glosso-pharyngeus, (Vide Fig. II. Num. 4, 5, and No. 3, lit. k.) again seperutes into four ramifica- tions. 137. First, running anteriorly from nerve. No. 136, which is carried obliquely under the ninth pair to the lingual artery, and gives oft' 138. A ramification, united by anastomosis to No. 140; for this runs backwards above the common trunk of the lingual and labial arteries, and incurvating about its inferior surface, again runs upwards behind it, and is received by No. 141, and No. 140. 139. A branch, connected with the cerato-glossus muscle by two surculi. 140. Second ramification, in like manner anterior. No. 1S6, which runs a little above the former, and almost transversely to the labial artery of Haller, and accom- panies this artery, receives No. 97, of the pharyngeus muscle. 141. The reception of No. 13S, into the branch. No. 140. 142. Third posterior ramulus. No. 136, which, after as- cending obliquely, the external carotid artery is joined with 143. Another gangliform, and reddish branch of No. 124, ascending behind the external carotid, and then on its posterior side.—(Its origin is seen. Fig. II. lit. s.) 144. Ramulus, arising from the united ramuli. No. 142, 143, ascending behind the commencement of the occipital artery, and further in the posterior lateral surface of the ex- ternal carotid, until it enters the small ganglion. No. 148. 145.

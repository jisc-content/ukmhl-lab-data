Tlie great utility of these, and other minute anatomical demonstrations of the organ of vision, will appear to those who study the diseases of the eye, many of which disorders would be incomprehensible without such previous knowledge. In the third volume of the Rational Practice of Physic^ after a short introduction on the doctrine of vision, and the defective modes of treating eye diseases : I have demonstrated, that there are ii8 diseases of the eyes, eye-lids, &cz. and it is hoped, many important improvements will be found in that work, worthy of the serious attention of Surgeons, ^nd Practitioners of Medicine, in general.

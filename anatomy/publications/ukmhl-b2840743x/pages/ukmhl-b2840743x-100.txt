Iviii HISTORY OF^MEDICINE. OF TIIK SIGNS OF CONCEPTION, BARRENNESS, &;c. IF a woman does not conceive, (g) and you wish to discover whether she be fruitful, or whether she shall conceive at all, let her be wraj ped about with cloaths, and make a fumigation under her; and if the smell be perceived to pass through her nostrils and mouth, y'ou may conclude that it is not her fault that she becomes not pregnant, (h) If a woman’s menses be suppressed, and she have neither shivering cold nor fever come upon her, and if she loath her meat, you may conclude she has conceived, (i) A woman, during pregnancy, is all over of greenish, palid colour, because her pure blood is daily drawn from her, and descends to the nourishment of the foetus, (k) Those women who have their womb cold and dense, do not ’ conceive, nor those who have it over moist, for the semen in them is extinguished; (1) neither they who have over dry, or hot wombs, for the semen corrupts for want of nourishment, (m) But they are most fertile who are of a moderate temperature. Women who arc prctcrnaturally fat and gross, do not conceive; because the orifice of their womb is compressed by the epiploon, neither will they ever be pregnant, till they become less corpulent, (n) If you would know whether a woman has conceived or not, give her honey and water, mixed together, when she goes to sleep, and if she have twistings and gripings in the belly, she has conceived, otherwise she has not. (o) \i a. woman be pregnant with a male, she is better ; coloured than if she has conceived of a female; (p) and if a woman that neither is, nor ever was with child, has milk in her j breasts, her monthly evacuations are lessened, (q) When blood is gathered together in women’s breasts, it signifies madness, (rj Women conceived, have the orifice of the uterus close contracted, (s) Males generally lie more on the right side, females on the left side of the matrix, (t) Plenty of milk, issuing from the breasts of women who are pregnant, i argues a weak child; (u) but if the breasts be solid and hard, it signifies a stronger child, (x) If the orifice of the j womb be hard, and solid, it must of consequence be closely shut, (y) | • > ABORTION. ' 3 IF the menstrual discharge continues, at the usual time, in a woman who is pregnant, it is impossible that the infant | should be well, (z) Women who have conceived, and are very thin, contrary to nature, suffer abortion till they grow | fatter, (a) But those women who are moderately corpulent, and who suffer abortion the second, or third month, without j any manifest cause, have the aceta bula, or glands of the uterus, filled with mucosities, and slime; which, therefore, cannot ij contain the foetus, by reason of its gravity, but are broken off. (b) If the breasts of a woman, pregnant, become slender, she is in danger of abortion, (c) If one breast grows slender, she will suffer abortion with one of her children, and if it be I the right that grows slender, she will miscarry of a male child; if the left, of a female. (d) If pregnant women fall into a fever, or become very lean, without any manifest cause, they have hard or dangerous labours; or are in danger of abor-4 tion. (e) In women pregnant, bleeding causes abortion; and that the sooner, the nearer the child is to its full time, (f) * A great purging, in pregnant women, is dangerous; for it may cause a miscarriage, (g) In V .y (g) Nat. raul.

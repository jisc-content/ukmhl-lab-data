Num. 2.) whence, 18. First ramulus, inserted into the rectus lateralis, and rectus anticus major of the head, by many surculi. —(Vide Fig. I. No. 3.) 19- Second ramulus, descending behind the par vagum to the great cervical ganglion.—(Vide Fig. I. Num. 4.) 20. Third, ascending to the anterior minor rectus-muscle of the head.—(Vide Fig. I. Num. 5.) 21. Fourth ramus, going to the ninth pair, here cut off.— (Vide Fig. I. Num. 6.) 22. Anterior ramus of the second pair of cervical nerves, and its communication with the anterior ramus of the first pair.—(Vide Fig. I. Num. 7.) 23. Ramus, proceeding from the above communication to the rectus anticus major muscle of the head.—(Vide Fig. I. Num. 8.) 24. Another ramulus of the same branch, inserted into the same muscle by two surculi. 25. 26. Two ramuli, of the anterior ramus of the second pair, which converging, unite; and, afterwards, by two ramuli, are inserted into the great cervical gang* Hon.—(Vide Fig. I. Num. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.) 27. Third ramus of the anterior ramus of the second pair, descending to the ganglion just mentioned.— (Vide Fig. I. Num. l6.) 28. Ramus, of the third pair of cervicals, united with ramus. No. 27-—(Vide Fig. I. Num. 24.) 29. Fourth ramus, running to the descendens of the ninth pair.—(Vide Fig. I. Num. 18.) 30.

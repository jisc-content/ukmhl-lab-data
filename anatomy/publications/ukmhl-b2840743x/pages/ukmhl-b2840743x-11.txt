INTRODUCTION TO SCHOLA MEDICINiE; OR, THE UNIVERSAL SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, &c. ^JL O obviate some defects in medical education, to promote the acquisition of medical science with greater facility, to render the principles and practice of medicine less conjectural, and to dif- fuse its excellent and humane benefits through all the earth, on improved principles, were the ex- citing motives, that strenuously impelled the author to write Schola Medicince Universalis Nova in Latin. ' â–  The principal impediments to useful medical studies, it appeared from close inspection and much reflection, were the multiplicity of authors, the variety of dubious systems, and the contrariety of opinions with which medicine superabounded. Professors formerly made a great display of appa- rent erudition by diffusive lectures, redundant in w^ords and speculations, parsimonious in matters of fact and absolute truths. This conduct in the teachers bewildered the understandings of the scho- lars; the former taught, and the latter imbibed prejudices from which they could never emancipate themselves through life: the destruction, instead of the preservation of the human species, have fre- quently been the consequence. Medicine, that divinest of arts! under such circumstances, became often a dangerous scourge instead of a blessing to human society, and yet, whoever dared to at- tempt improvement, or laudably endeavoured to produce a reformation, was certain of inevitable ruin for his temerity: for every innovator, however meritorious, was accounted rash; but every assentor to opinions, and supporter of common doctrines, was considered prudent, wise, and learned. The examples of punishment for the greatest exertions of human skill and industry have deterred many excellent men from delivering to society the honest fruits of their labours, and man- kind, by these means, have been deprived of several useful discoveries. It requires Herculea-H spirit to cleanse the Augeean stable of the accumulation of ages: sed nil desperandum: led by sacred truth, error, and fallacy must vanish, however supported. The introduction of an immense number of volumes is frequently supposed an indubitable speci- men of profound learning, and juvenile vanity is pleasingly gratified by a free access to large libraries ; but extensive libraries are, to many, great evils: for they oftener confound than instruct students, by overwhelming the memory, without informing and elevating the judgment a * Tlie

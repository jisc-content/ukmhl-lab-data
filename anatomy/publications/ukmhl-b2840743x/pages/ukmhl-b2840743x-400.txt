( ) THE FEMUR, ou THIGH BONE. SITUATION^. Between the pelvis and tibia. SHAPE. Is long. .. DIVISIOX. Into body, and two extremities; one superior; the other inferior. PROJECTIONS AT THE SUPERIOR EXTREMITY ARE 1. Hie head, which is semi-circular. 2. The neck, which goes obliquely from the head to the trochanters. 3. The great trochanter, which is an external tuberosity. 4. The little trochanter, situated inwardly, and lower. PROJECTIONS AT THE INFERIOR EXTREMITY ARE 5. The external condyle. 6. internal, which is rather larger. CAVITIES AT THE SUPERIOR EXTREMITY. 1. A fovea at the head for the liganientum teres. CAVITIES AT THE INFERIOR EXTREMITY. 2. Sinus of the patella, between the condyles to receive the patella. 3. Posterior groove of the condyles, which contains the popliteal vessels. CONNECTION WITH THREE BONES. 1. With the acetabulum, by anarthrosis. 2. head of the tibia; and 3. patella, by ginglymus. SUBSTANCE. Compact in the body; spongy at each extremity; reticular internally. USE. To form part of the lower extremity. THE TIBIA. SITUATION. At the inner part of the leg between the thigh and jnsfep. / SHAPE. Longitudinal. DIVISION. Into body, upper and lower extremities. ITS PROMINENCES ARE X. The head of the tibia, which is formed into two articu- lating sinuses. 2. The spine of the tibia, to w-hich the ligament of the patella, and common tendon of the exteiisor muscles of the tibia adhere. 3. The crista of the tibia is a sharp anteri r margin, de- scending from the spine. 4. The malleolus internus, or internal ankle, which is an inferior process of the tibia. THE CAVITIES ARE Two articulating sinuses at the head of the tibia, in which the condyles of the femur are situated. An articiriating cavity at the inferior extremity for articu- lation with the astragalus. CONNECTION WITH FOUR BONES. 1. With the condyles of the femur, by ginglymus. 2. patella, I , 3. fibula, jbysyneurosis. 4. astragalus, by arthrodia. USE. To support the leg, and perform the flexion of the inferior extremity. THE FIBULA. SITUATION. At the exterior part of the leg, near the tibia. SHAPE. Longitudinal. DIVISION, Into body, superior and inferior extremities. ITS PROMINENCES ARE 1. The head of the tibia, which is at its superior extremity, 2. The malleolus e.xternus, or outer ankle, at the inferior extremity. CONNECTION WITH TWO BONES. The astragalus, and tibia. USE. To support the tibia, and assist in forming the leg. THE PATELLA. SITUATION. In the sinus, between the condyles of the femur, and above the tibia. SHAPE. Like a heart. DIVISION. Into external and internal surface; into base, appx, and sides. CONNECTION

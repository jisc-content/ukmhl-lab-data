( »54 ) In putiirt fever and scnrvy, liulc was discovered. In the diabetes, wlicieiu, according to the ingenious Doctors Kollo and Dobson, sugar is present in the urine, the serum of blood is like tvhey. DISSOLUTION OF BLOOD. In the very vehement yellow, and other highly putrid fevers, of hot di-nates, I have seen the putrid dissolved blood, lorced by arterial action through the ealuilent arteiics on the surface of the skin, in the form of a putrid sanies, horrid in odour. Similar appearances of broken down blood from the mouth, gnms, and other parts, I have seen, in inveterate scurvy, from long voy- ages, salt diet, confined air, and tlte absence of land air, fresh diet and vegetables, &C. 1.

Resembles spermaceti. 2. Is inspissated bile. 3. Is a mixture of the two first. These are s«liible in alcalirs. The fourth species, according to Haller apd Dr. Saunders, are insoluble in alchoL, or spirits of turpentine. THE CERUMEN, OR WAX OF THE EAR, - IS COMPOSED OF 1. Albumen. 4. Soda. S.

MUCUS OF CAVITIES Contains more mucilage, but less water ; otherwise, as far as experiments have been made, is similar to tears. SINOVIA OF CAPSULAR, LIGAMENT, &c.

Urat of ammonia. and ammonia. 7. An animal malterl 3. Phosphat of lime. 5. Oxalat of lime. But a more particular analysis, according to Fourcroy and Vaquelin, who e.xamined more than six hnndred calculi, and divided them iuto three genera, and twelve species, are as follows : GENUS I. Calculi, composed of one ingredient. SpF.. 1. Uric acid.—Colour of wood, yellow, red. - 2. Urat of ammonia.—Brownish white. 3. Oxalat of lime,—Colour soot brown. GENUS II. Composed of two ingredients. SpE. 1. Uric acid, and the phosphats in laj’ers.—Like chalk. 2. Ditto, mixed together.—Varies in appearance. 3 Urat of ammonia, and phosphat in layers. —— 4. Ditto, mixed together —Botli similar. • 5. The phosphats, mixed in layers.—Like chalk. 6. Oxalat of lime, and uric acid in layers. — 7. Oxalat of lime, and phosphats in layers. \ GENUS III. Containing more than three ingredients. SpE. 1. Urat of ammonia, or uric acid, the phosphats, and oxalat of lime. I 2. Uric, acid, urat of ammonia, the phosphats, silica. As far as solvents are concerned, the calculi may be reduced to three heads : 1. Uric acid, f SOLVENTS. and am- "S-A. pure weak solution of potass and soda, which can be inonia. ( held in the mouth. 2. The phos- f Quickly dissolved by nitric acid so weak, that it may phats of < be swallowed without inconvenience, and pos- Jime, ( sessed of no greater acridity than urine itself. (’Ey nitric acid, or by carbonat of potass or soda, 3. Oxalat of j weak enougli not to irritate the bladder j but lime. } the action of these substances are sloiv, and ( scarcely complete. These weak solutions, a little warm, are injected into the bladder, after being emptied of urine, and suflTered to remain in contact «itb the calculus, or stone, as long as bearable, without irritation or pain. It is difficult to ascertain, however, what species of stone may be in the bladder. The composition of the tube, through which the liquid is introduced, should be well considered.—It appears to me, that the tubes, composed of elastic gum, are most proper; because, little or no effect is produced on that substance, either by acids or alcalies, which I demonstrated above thirty years ago. Tlie body might be supersaturated with those solutions, skilfully ap- plied, in conjunction with an appropriate regimen: but, under such courses, extreme caution should be used, lest, instead of relief, mischief might ensue. These various facts shew, what a complicated machine the Art of Medicine has to act on, in the different aberrations and muta- tions of tlie constituent principles, under a state of disease. These compositions of inanimate matter, after death, and, in general, disease, might not have existed in animated nature: some are creatures of the fire ; others of acids, alcalie.s &c. therefore great caution is necessary in their application, during life, either in health, or disease. niYSlOLOGV,

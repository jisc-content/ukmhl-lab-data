The abdomen is divided into the anterior region. posterior ditto, called the loins, and lateral regions. The anterior region of the abdomen is subdivided into 'Jâ€™be epigastric region, the sides of which, under the libs, are called the hypocondriac regions. 2, The umbilical region, the sides of which are called the lumbar regions. 3, The hypogastric region, the sides of which arc called iliac, or inguinal regions.

T internal surface, which is mucous : this is called the mal- pighian mucus, or rete mucosum. CONNECTION. The epidermis is connected with the skin by means of this mucus. !" Thickness of the epidermis, on the face, is very inconsider- able; in the palm of the hand, and some part of the sole of the loot, it is much thicker. COLOUR. i Depends on the malpighian mucus, which, in Europeans, is white. | Ethiopians, black. | Spaniards, yellow. USE.

PARTICULAR DIVISION! CONNECTION OF THE STERNUM. Of each rib into body and extremities ; anterior and poste- rior, into external: and internal surface; superior and inferior margins. THE EMINENCES ARE 1. The greater head, which is connected to the articulating fovea of the dorsal vertebra. 2. The neck,' which is that part adhering between the two heads. 3. The smaller head, which adheres to the transverse apo- physes of the dorsal vertebra. 4f. The angle, which is the posterior, and most convex part of the rib. CAVITIES IN EACH ARE \ 1. The longitudinal furrow, at the inferior margin, which receives the intercostal artery: always to be re- membered in the operation for the empyema. SUBSTANCE. The anterior part is cartilaginous; the posterior, and every other portion is bony and compact. CONNECTION. The anterior extremity of each true rib is connected with the sternum, by synchondrosis. ^ The posterior extremities of all the ribs, true, and false, are connected by ginglymus to the dorsal vertebra, by means of the greater and smaller heads. USE OF THE RIBS Is to form the thorax, or chest; to assist respiration; defend the vital viscera; and give adhesion to the breasts, and muscles. THE STERNUM. ^ SITUATION. At the anterior part of the pelvis, between the true ribs. SHAPE. Like a stilleto, or dagger, . DIVISION, Into internal and external surface; superior and inferior extremities; lateral margins; superior and inferior portions ; appendix of the inferior part, called en- siform cartilage. CAVITIES ARE 1. Jugular sinus, which is near the upper and middle part of the trachea. 2. Two clavicular sinuses at th* sides of the upper part, to which the clavicles are joined. 3. Seven costal fovea; at the lateral margins for the ribs. 1. With each clavicle, by arthrodia. 2. cartilages of the seven true ribs, by synchon-*--' drosis. \' SUBSTANCE. Is rather spongy. - '^1'' USE. Jy To form the thorax ; and to give adhesion to the anterior ■ mediastinum. CAVITY OF THE PELVIS. SITUATION. In the lower region of the trunk. SHAPE. Greatly resembles a barber’s bason. DIVISION. Into wings, and cavity. I^THE CAVITY Is sub-divided into entrance, and termination. COMPOSITION. It consists of four bones: two ossa innominata; the os j sacrum ; and the os coccygis. CONNECTION. The bones, forming the pelvis, are connected by synchond/osis. USE. i To contain the organs of generation; the bladder; the intestine, called rectum; and to support the spine. OSSA INNOMINATA. SITUATION. At the sides of the pelvis. SHAPE. I Is irregular. DIVISION OF EACH IN THE FOETUS INTO THREE X PORTIONS; NAMELY, 1. Into the os ilei, forming the upper part. 2. os ichii, lower part. 3. os pubis, supejior and fore part. DIVISION Of the bone into external and internal surface, THE H 'I

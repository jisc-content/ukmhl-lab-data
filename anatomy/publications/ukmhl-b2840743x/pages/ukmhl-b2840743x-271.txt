( 43 ) PLATE XXXrV. \ Figure I. ’ - Also delineates the nerves running to the heart fiom the right side of the human body, and the branches lying over the arteria florta. Thus, this is represented with the subcla- vian, connnm, and internal carotid arteries, in as natural a situation as could be preserved: the more considerable nerves funning behind these vessels are only marked by points. The whole neck, for the same reason, is extended as in the first plate, viz. by putting under it a wooden cylinder. But of 1 those parts which the preceding plate represents, the following are cut away: external ear, sterna, and cleido-mastoideus mus- cles, biventer rnaxillee inferioris, sti/lo-kj/oideus, with the mi/lo- hyoideus muscles, and also the maxillary gland, and processus i stylo-hyoideus. f ^ A. Musculus bii'cnter cervicis, whose tendinous extremity, * affixed to the os accipitis, with a certain part of the flesh is perceived. I B. M\x%c\x\ms splenius capitis, and its tendinous extremity, in- serted in the occipital bone, maxillary bone, and proccssui cognomini. ; C. Musculus levator scapula. D. scalenus lateralis. £ £ E.

' N, Superior venter of the musculus coraco-hyoideus. O. Musculus sterno-hyoideus. ^ ' P. sterno-thyroideus. Q. cerato-glossus, proceeding from the cornu of the hyoid bone to the tongue. R. basio-glossiis, arising, some part of it from the horn of the os hyoidis, but the greater part from its basis. S. genia-hyoideus. T. genio-glossus. V. i ■ -.1 longus colli, visible in part, I W. Part of the superior constrictor muscle of the pharynx. %. Musculus of the left side, r. Occipital bone. * A. Mammillary process of the temporal bone, B. Meatus gudUorius externus, ,as yet covered with skin on its inferior surface. At the same time a particle of the carti- lage adheres to it. - A. Styloid process is removed with a part of the temporal bone, from whidh it was taken. E. Capifulum maxillce inferioris, s, processus condyloideus. The ligament covering it is dissected. II. Angle of the maxilla inferior. E. Sublingual gland, in a part prouunent. <1>. Basis of the hyoid bone. y. A situation where the cornu of the os-hyoides lies concealed, SI. Thyroid cartilage. a. Common trunk of the carotid arteries. b. Its cerebral ramus, called internal carotid. c. Its flexure, called flexura Cowperiana, always present be- yond the canal of the carotid; in this body it verges so much out as to cover, in a part, the internal jugular vein. d. External ramus of the carotid, called externa carotis. But it must be observed, that the common carotid artery» lit. a. internal, lit. b. and external, lit. c. in this figure aie re- moved a little forward. For in its natural situation, the caro- tis communis and interna lay near to that very long ganglion, Num. l68, 169, 170, even somewhat cover it. g. Common trunk of the lingual labial artery. h. Lingual artery, under the cerato-glossus. i. Labial artery of Haller, the rami of which are omitted ; it is called by others angularis, or facialis. k. Trunk of the external carotid artery rising towards the temples. l. Occipital artery, which ascends obliquely above the mter- nal jugular vein. m. The auricularis posterior artery is cut off" in this body more lemarkable than usual. • - n. Artery running to themasseter muscle. 0. parotid gland. p- maxillaris interna. q. . .! temporalis.

Third, and anterior branch of ganglion. No. 241, which soon after dividing into two, sends off 247. The left branch, forming a surculus farther in its course, 248.

Right ramulus. No. 250, running above the subclavian J artery, then inserted behind it into another ramus of the first thoracic ganglion, and makes another ansa, inclosing the sub- clavian artery. 253. Nerve, which arises from the conflux of cervical nerves, No. 67, 68, 69, and passes into fJie superior thoracic ganglion, behind the inferior thyroid, (marked here with dots.) 254. Inferior part of the eighth pair.—For w'e have thought proper not to delineate its cervical trunk to shew the other parts better. 255. Its recurrent branch carried upwards to the larynx. 256. First branch of the recurrent nerve, which is given off at its commencement. ! t 257. Superior ramification of the same, augmenting the cardiac nerve of the first thoracic ganglion. 258. Another and inferior branch, which proceeding to- wards the cardiac ple.xus, receives 259. A ramification of the second recurrent branch* 260. A branch arising from the combination of No. 258,. and 259, which, after proceeding farther, gives off 261. A surculus to the trachea; and 262. Another surculus to the bronchial gland, adhering to- the vena cava. I 263, 264. Third and fourth surculus of the cardiac branch, :No. 258, dispersed above the trachea. 26.5. The remainder of nerve, No. 258, migrating to the cardiac plexus. 266. Second branch of the recurrent, which, aftersend- ing oft a ramulus, No. 259> to the first of the recurrents, gives off another. 267. A ramification to the superficial nerve, No. 197-— (Its third ramulus inserted into the cardiac nerve of the su- perior thoracic ganglion, is covered by the arteiia innomi- nata.) 268. A branch descending from the par vagum a little be- low the origin of the recurrent nerve. 269. Conjunction of this branch with No. I92. 270. 271. First and second surculus of nerve, No. 268, turning to the trachea. 272. Insertion of the second branch of the par vagum. No. 278, into its first part. No. 268. 273. Connection of the third branch of the eighth pair with the first Num. 26'8. 274. Third surculus of No. 26s, which, dividing in two parts, H terminated above the asperu arteria, ox trachea. 275. 276. 277. Three ramifications'of No. 268, running to the cardiac plexus. 278. Second branch of the eighth pair. 279- Third branch of the eighth, which exhibits the fol;* lowing—marked, • 230. Running to the first part of the eighth pair. ' 281. Surculus of the third branch of the par vagum run- ning to the vena cava. 282. Another small branch running to the cardiac plexus. 283. Third ramification distributed on the lungs. 284. Descent of the fifth pair of cervicals, or the first of the brachial nerves. 285. The sixth pair of ce'rvicals, or second of Brachial nerves. 286. Conjunction of the first and second brachials. 287. Nerve from the divided combination of the first and second, to be joined with the third, fourth, and fifth. 288. The supra-scapular nerve. 289- A nerve, arising-from the connection of the first, as •well as second : also, from the third pf the brachials, passing forwards with No.. 290, 2Q2, 2Q3. 290* Its* ramification migrating to the super-scapulary nerve. No. 288. 291. Conjunction of No. 289 with the fourth aud fifth. 292. Origin of the median nerve. 293. The muscular cutaneous nerve, or cutaneous ex- ternus. 294. Third of the brachial, or seventh pair of cervicals. 295. Nerve, composed of the fourth and fifth of the bra- chials, or eighth pair of cervicals, and first of dorsals, 296. Conjunction of the same with a part of the third of brachials; and also 297. With apart of the first and second. O 298. t

SEMIOTICA, OR DOCTRINE of the SIGNS OF DISEASES. A sign is a phaenomenon, or appearance, by which we know the state of a present, past, or future disease. The signs of diseases are divided, into, 1. Diagnostic, which denote the present state of the disease. 2. Anamnestic, shewing the preceding state of the disease. 3. Prognostic, which denote the future state of the disease. The diagnostic signs are subdivided into projjer, common, and cpigenomena. The prognostic signs are subdivided into good, equivocal, and bad. THE DIAGNOSTIC OF DISEASES. This is a science, explaining the signs, by which a present disease may be known, and distinguished from ano- ther ; thus the signs of a present disease, are found out by the assistance of the external senses, soun4 judgment, and analogy, by anatomy, &c, 1. By the touch, with the finger, or instruments, as a ca- theter, or probe, by which we know the extent or di- rection of wounds, or ulcers, the presence of a cal- culus in the bladder, fracture, or luxation of a bone, f hardness,

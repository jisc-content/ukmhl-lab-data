They run to the anterior surface of the labia majora pudendoruni, to the nymphae, external aperture of the urethra, where the anterior myrtiform-caruiicles are placed, and to the inferior part of the mons veneris.— After sending out these rami, the nervus clytoridcus, with all its five rami, 530. Runs into one nerve, which passes to the clytoric glans, prepuce of the clytoris, upper part of the nymphse, an'd to the mons veneris. 531. Trunk of the internal haemorrhoidal nerves, arising from the third sacra! nerve,, and 532. to 534. Dividing into three rami.—The first ramus of * the hasinorrhoidal nerve, 531, is divided into five surculi k^Diinores, viz. 535. 535. 535. 536. ^ose marked 535, 536, 537, are rather superficial, and are terminated in the musculus sphincter externus, sphinc- ter internus, and cutis of the orifice of the anus.—The remaining rami, distinguished by'the figures, are deeper, and distributed on the external sphincter muscle of the amis, internal and e.xternal, or nervous coat of the intesti- n^nn rectum. Second ramus of the haemorrhoidal nerve, 531, divides into two rami: of these, 540. &c. The-first is that which is terminated in the internal sphincter ani, and cutis of the anus. 541. 541. The other ramifications of nerve, 533.—This ira- •^^mediatcly divides into two cutaneous rami. 542. 542. 542. The cutaneous nerve of the perineum, and 543. 543. 543. Into the nervus cutaneus of the anus, which terminates in the cutis, a little more remote from the ori- fice of anus.—Third ramus, 534, of the haemorrhoidal nerve, 531, is divided into three ramuli. 1544. &c. &c. The first ramus of the cutaneous, 534, nerve of the anus, and perinaeum. fit )545. &c. &c. Second nerve, 534, is terminated in the skin of the perinaeum. |546. &c. Third of nerve, 534, divaricates into two surculi. 1547. 547. Cutaneous ramulus, which disappears in the lowest part of the labia majora pudendorum. 1543. &c. Another surculus oi^nerve, 546, immediately di- vides into II549. 549. 549. Several surculi, which disappear in the up- per part of the labia majora pudendorum j )50. But the last ramus, 548, ascends into the mons veneris. Nervus ligamentosus, disappearing in the ligamentmxLtu- beroso'sacrum.. Besides tlvc ramificatiojw just mentioned, they run from thei" third pair of sacral nerves, 551. to 553. Nervi pudendales: when the pndendalis, 551, unites with nervus pudendalis, 553, then 555. Is terminated in the lowest extremity of the labia pu- dendorum.—Nervus pudendalis, 552, dividing into , 556. to 557. Many ramuli, disappear in the lateral part of the cutis perinxi, and lowest region of the labia pudendo- rum. 558. &c. &CC. Is the first cutaneous ramus, or branch of the perinmum, and labia pudendorum of nerve, 553. 559. 559. Second cutaneofis ramus of the perinaeum, and pudenda externa of nerve, 553, which 560. 560. Are lost in minute branches on the lateral part of the skin of the nates, towards the pudenda. 561. to 565. The other cutaneous surculus of ramus, 559, is that of the anus, perinaeum, and circumference of the pudenda. 566. Ramulus, anastomosing with nerve, 558, 567. Surculus, anastomosing with ramus, 587, 568. &c. &c. Third ramus of nerve, 553, whi(^ is termi- nated in the lowest and lateral part of the skin ol the nates, where it continues towards the anus. 569. 569. Anastomosis of, the trunk of the third sacral nerve with nerve, 558, 570. Inferior longus pudendalis, 571. to 573- Arising by three radices from the origin, of the ischiatic nerve. 574. &c. &c. Rami of the nervus pudendalis longus, termi- nating in the cutis of the nates, and region of the anus. 575. Second ramus of nerve, 570, which 576. to 583. Arc distributed by surculi, on the cutis of the anus, perinaeum, and lateral part of the labia pudendo- rum. 584. Third ramus of nerve, 570, which runs into two ra- muli. 585. A cutaneous nerve of the anus, and 586. Ramulus, which again is divided into three surculi: of these, the first 587. Is muscular, which is terminated in the levator of the ^corpus cavjernosum of the clitoris. 588. to 590. Second cutaneous surculus, extending towards the lowest part of the cutis of the labia pudendorum. 591. to 597. Third ramus is of nerve, 586, which is lost m the skin of the middle and superior part of the labia pu- dendorum. 598. to 60s. Fourth ramus of the nervus pudendalis inferior, distributed on the cutis of the anus, and perinaeum. 609. Fifth ramus of nerve, 5/0, which divides into tvro rami, 610. 611. 611. 612. 613. 614. Which terminate in the lowest and interior cutis of the nates,. T Figure I

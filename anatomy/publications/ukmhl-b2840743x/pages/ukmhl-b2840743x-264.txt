( 38 ) L«rft ramulus of lljo73 Tamas. 75. A ramuhis, soon at’ter the commencement of tlie 74th branch drawn on the right haiul from it, running in two sur- ■culi between (ho trachea and arteria pulmoiiaiis to the left sinus and smooth surface of the heart. 76'. Trunk of the 74th branch, which, after advancing fur- tlior on the left, divides into 2 rainuli. 77. 77. 77. Throe ramuli of ramus, of the superior nerve 70', descending between the pulmonary artery and aorta, emerging with many surculi in the interior surface of the pulmonary artery, (which in this plate is not seen.) 78. The other and inferior small branch of nerve. No. 76, under the aorta, descending with ramulus. No. 140, between it and tire pulmonary artery to the left sinus. 7.9. The right ramulus of the middle branch 73, running almost in a direct line between the arcli of the aorta and right pulmonary artery, and there distribute into the third rami SO, 81 and 84* 80. 80. Left ramulus of branch 79> descending under the arch of the aorta and right pulmonary artery to the left sinus by two surculi, 81. 81. Middle small branch, ramus 79> which proceeding a little between the arch of the aorta and right pulmonary ar- tery, bends round the ramus. No. 86, and ascends to the pos- terior surface of the arch of the aorta. 82. 83. Two ramuli, arising from ramulus 81, which sur- rounding the aorta coming from the right, the ventricle on the right side, there disperse many surculi, and at length accom- panies the right coronary artery in the anterior surface of the ' heart. 84. 84. Right branch of 79> which, after receiving No. 229 and 113, runs between the aorta and pulmonary artery, and at length extend under the right pulmonary artery in two surculi to the left sinus, in the same manner as ramulus 80. 85. 85. External ramus of the nerve 66, descending be- tween the right pulmonary artery and aorta, and uniting two ramuli num. 86. 87. Which accompany the left coronary artery. 88. A small ganglion, which forms as it were an appendix to the great thoracic ganglion, (No. 6'0) situated on its supe- rior part between the first and second rib, but on the inferior side, placed on the second rib.—(It may be called Dorsale Secundum; which, however, is seldom found in this place.) 89- A branch running from the first dorsal nerve to this ganglion. 90. Ganglion dorsale tertium, (in other bodies the second) situated between the second and third rib. 91. A ramulus, running from the second dorsal nerve to the ganglion, No. 90. 92. 92. 92. The trunk of the eighth pair, called Vagum, descending in the neck, drawn on the right side below by an hamulus, belter to elucidate the recurrent with its ramifica- tions ; whence, its former situation, on the superior side, could not be preserved. 93. 93. Recurrent nerve of the par vagum, which bending about the subclavian artery, ascends to the larynx.—It is evident that this must be drawn out of its natural situation. 94. First ramus of the recurrent nerre soon after its rise giving off. 95. A small branch, which running a little on the left* is united with 96. The second branch of the recurrent nerve. 97. Another ramulus of the first recurrent branch, which 1 also is inserted into the united ramuli 95 and 96. 98. A ramus, from tlie combination of the 95, 96, and 97th rami, which running on the left, is divided into two, 99 a>‘d 102. 99’ 99- A small branch arising from a division of the branch 98, which ascends towards the trachea, and after taking up the fourth ramus of the recurrent, (No. 142) is dis- tributed into the third rami, of which 100. 100. The second superior are inserted in the inus- cuius sterno-hyoideus. 101. But the third is distributed on the right lateral surface of the trachea. 102. Another small branch, arising from a division of the 98th, proceeding together to the trachea, and ascending on it. 103. Conjunction of the ramus 102, with Num. II6 ramus. 104. Three surculi of ramus 102, dispersed in the anterior surface of the aspera arteria. 105. Two nerves, formed by the coalescing rami $5, 96, 97, descending to the cardiac plexus : in its passage forming an anastomosis. No. 43 with branch No, 40. 106. 106, Three of its ramuli, extending behind the right pulmonary artery to the left sinus, and plain surface of the heart.—Vide Halleri’s Elem. Physiol, §. I. p, 360. 107. Fourth ramulus of 105, running on the left above the right pulmonary artery, also forming in part No. 81 and 84. 108. Surculus, distributed in the right pulmonary artery.* 109. Fifth and middle ramulus of the ramus 105, in like manner ascending on the right pulmonary artery, which gives* 110. A surculus to the above artery ; and 111. Another ramulus to the right ear; and also 112. A third ramulus, accompanying the right coronary artery : but before it gives off the surculus. 113. Anastomosing with ramulus 84. 114. Third branch of 94, which running on the left, is di- vided into 115 and II9. 115. A branch ascending a little towards the trachea, or aspera arteria; but before it arrives there is divided intp three ramuli, of which the superior 116. Runs between the aspera arteria and cesophagus ; but prior to that, by means of ramulus, No, 103, it anastomosti with ramus. No. 102 ; but the 117. Middle 118. Inferior ramus ascend the aspera arteria, and there separate into several surculi. 119- Another ramus, arising from a division of the ram# 114, which descending, is joined to the ramus 39, and withl| forms a ramus, No. 40, running to the cardiac plexus. ! ,'i I i't' Ui [fc tie jtm fie r I, 1 |ti:’ Ui i 1. jni \i 120.

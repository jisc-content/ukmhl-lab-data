HISTORY OF MEDICINE. ciii Nor can ftll human actions be explained by these demonstrative principles, but those only, which arise from the mere struc- ture of the body, as the vital and natural, but not the animal functions; for these are neither dependant on the body or mind only, but proceed from an intimate connexion of both. Since, therefore, these actions are not totally corporeal, they cannot be explained, much less demonstrated by principles peculiar to corporeal bodies only. Some philosophers have existed, who, according to the system of Epicuhus, and Lucretius, derived the actions of the human body entirely from corporeal aflections; and others, on the contrary, denied the existence of bodies, and endeavoured to deduce all phenomena from a spiritual principle only. Those of the former sect were called and those of the latter both were hj'po- thotical enthusiasts.

HISTORY OF MEDICINE XXXIV coniing upon one who' has a burning fever, dissolves it; (t) and rigors of the nerves succeeding convulsions removea them. (u) Those fevers which have cold fits every day, (x) are daily dissolved ; and tremblings, or convulsions succeeding sleep, are very bad signs, (y) Tremblings in fevers are frequently removed by a delirium, (x) t, ’ - swE.vrs. ' SWEATS, if they begin upon the third, fifth, seventh, ninth, eleventh, fourteenth, seventeenth, twenty-first, twenty-seventh, thirtieth, or thirty-fourth days, are beneficial; ("a) for those sweats determine the disease, (bj But when sweats happen otherwise, it is an indication of a troublesome and lingering disease. It is an argument of much moisture ; f'ej it fever is prolonged, if sweats happen, which do not remove the feverish heat. Cold sweats, in acute fevers, signify death ; but in more mild diseases the continuance of tlie distemper, fdj After a sweat; a shivering is bad. Vehement and sudden sweats, on critical days, are dangerous; ('ej and so arc such as the forehead sends out like drops, and springing water, and likewise those that are cold, and in great plenty ; for sweats of this kind, cannot be sent forth with- out violence, and excessive labour, nor till after d. long time. He observes, if a yellowness appear all over the body on the seventh, ninth, eleventh, or fourteenth day, (f) it is good, unless the right hypochondrium be hard, for then it is bad. (g) But if a yellowness appears before the seventh day, it is bad, (h) unless the humours are carried off by the intestines. A tough and viscous moisture hangs about the teeth of those who have very fierce and vehement fevers, (i) Fevers, un- less they leave persons on odd days, are apt to return. fArJ BREATH. THE breath not keeping its due course in fevers is bad ; for it signifies a convulsion. URINE. THE urines in fevers are advantageous that are thick, and curdled, and little in quantity; especially if they be such as have a sediment at the first, or not long after they are evacuated. Those who have their urine foul, like that of cat- tle, are, or will be troubled with the head ach. If a crisis happen upon the seventh day, then the urine has a small red cloud in it upon the fourth day. (in) Urines thqt are pellucid and white, are bad ; but these generally appear in phrenetic persons, (n) ^ DIET, &c. • PEOPLE of an extreme fulness of body, are in a state of danger, for they cannot continue in the same state, nor change into a better: it remains, therefore, that they must decline into a worse. Wherefore an over full habit of body, should be speedily removed, to the end that it may take a beginning to new nourishment. Neither are we to evacuate, the vessels to an extremity, (t) Predicat.

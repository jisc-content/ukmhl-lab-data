(oj- So extreme evacuations arc dan- gerous, as likewise an extreme repletion. In lingering diseases, a slender diet is always dangerous; ('p) and in acute diseases likewise, where it is not convenient. And again, diet reduced to extreme slenderness, is as full of danger, as extreme repletion, (q) The sick may offend in a slender diet, and thereby grow worse; for every error, in this case, is more dangerous, than in a more plentiful diet. For the same reason, a very slender and too precise a diet, (r) is somewhat dangerous to sound and healthful bodies; (s) because they endure the errors of it with more difficulty; and therefore, a thin and exquisite sparing diet, (t) is more dangerous than that which is somewhat plentiful. When the disease is very sharp or acute, and is immediately attended with dangerous symptoms, we must use a most exqui- sitely tender diet; but when it is not so,, (v) we may use a fuller diet; and as the disease declines, we may gradually and proportionably increase the diet. When the force of the disease is the greatest, (u) the most sparing diet must be observed : but the patient should be coasidered, whether he has strength to bear the prescribed diet: (x) for even in the height of the disease,, if the diet be not sufficient, the patient will grow faint, and sink under the distemper. In diseases which come instantly to their height, (y) we must instantly administer slender diet; but in tliosc that have not yet come to their height, we may allow a fuller diet at first, to preserve the patient's strength, and afterwards gradu- ally diminish it. In paroxysms, or sharp fits of intermitting diseases, wc must take away meat; for to allow it then, would be injurious, (z) The same abstinence is to be observed, in fits that are heightened in their periodical returns. Old men easily endure fasting, those who are middle aged, not so well \ (a) young men worse again than them, and chil- dren worst of all; especially those that are of a more lively spirit. Those bodies that grow, (b) have much more natural heat, therefore they require great store of food, or else the body consumes. But old men have little heat in them, therefore they require but little food. And this is the reason that old men have not very acute fevers; (c) because their bodies are cold. The belly is naturally hottest in winter, and the spring, and most addicted to rest; consequently, in those seasons, a greater proportion of food is to be allowed; (d) because the in- ward heat is stronger, which is the reason that a more plentiful food is necessary. This difference may be seen in such as are old; and in such as are lusty, and well grown bodies. Moist diet is good for all who arc inclinable to fevers, but especially for children, (e) and others who are accustomed to such diet. ^ We ought to consider, to whom it may be convenient to feed once or twice in the day, more and less, by little and little. Wc must attribute something, also, to custom, (f) season, country, and age. In the, summer, and autumn, (g) sick peo- ple can hardly digest any meat at all; but more easily in spring; and easiest of all, in ^he winter. ,(h) No food ought to ] be given, or forced upon such as have fits returning periodically. But food ought to be rather diminished, (i) before ma- nifest tokens appear, to form a proper judgment of a disease. ‘ ■ ) 1 In his book, De Dimla, he says, that the flesh of dogs is heating, drying, and of a corrdborating (k) nature, but does ! not easily pass through tlie intestines, whereas that of whelps is of a moistening, lubricating quality,’ and is easily discharged I that v/ay.

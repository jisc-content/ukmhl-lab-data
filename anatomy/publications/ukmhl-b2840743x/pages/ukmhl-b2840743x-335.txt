The right hepatic plexus, formed by ganglions of the right and left side; from this the liver, gall-bladder, stomach duodenum, and pancreas, receive nerves. The duodenal nerves of the pancreas, and stomach, are des- cending rami of the hepatic jilexus ; the hepatic nerves, and those of the gall-bladder, are ascending rami. 117. 117.

Fourth hepatic nerve, Plate XXXVII. arising be- tween the aorta and vena cava, a little from the left by the vena cava, it is covered, then ascending, it so proceeds to the liver, that, after uniting with the hepatic ramus, composed of the 55, and 57 ramus, it is terminated in the hepatic plexus. From this hepatic plexus the nerves arise,, which migrate to the ductus choledochus, to the ductus cysticus, to the gall- bladder, to the hepatic ductus, and even to the liver itself. 155. 155. 155.

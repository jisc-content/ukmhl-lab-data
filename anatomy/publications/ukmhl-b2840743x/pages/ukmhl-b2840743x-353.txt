Interior lamina of the vagina of the optic nerve; d. Pia mater of the optic nerve, e. Central artery, f. Part of the cribrous lamina, through which the medullary substance of the optic nerve passes, g. The Rclefotica posteriorly thick, where it is connected with the vagina of the nerve, it. A circle, surrounding the cribrous lamina, whence the pia mater of the optic nerve is reflected ; and i. goes into the interior lamina of the sclerotica, k. Parallel arteries, apparent in the internal surface of choroides. 1. Vascular reticulum, obscurely visible; by which the arte- ries of the choroides are covered, w. White folds of the ciliary processes, n. Iris. o. Connection of the sclerotica with the cornea. Figure II. reticulum laid over the choroides only VI- ' SIBLE BY A VERY POWERFUL MICROSCOPE. a. Arteriolas of the internal surface of the choroides. b. Vascular reticulum. t. Natural magnitude of this portion of the choroides, of which this is the resemblance. Figure III. ANNULUS OF THE CILIARY PROCESSES, OBSCURELY SEEN A LITTLE ENLARGED. a. Part of the sclerotica. b. Part of the choroides.' c. Ora serrata, which distinguishes the annulus from the remaining choroides. d: Posterior part of the serrated an- nulus. e. Anterior p'art, composed of the folds of the crliar processes, Anterior, broad, eminent part of the folds. g. g. Some folds terminated, in the extreme, bifid. k. Posterior part of the fold formed by many radiculae. i. Posterior view of the iris, called Uvea, striated, k. Pupilla. Figure IV. .,, THREE FOLDS OF THE CILIARY' PROCESSES, "WTIOSE vascular fabric is oeseRv.vble by a good MICROSCOPE. «. Innumerable parallel arteriolie. conspicuous in the internal surface of the choroides. 1. Vasculum majusculum, running in the eminent margin, c. The arch, through which the vascula in the apex of the plica are joined together. d. Reticulum vasculosum. e. Posterior appearance of the iris. y. Natural magnitude of this portion, which is drawn a little increased. Figure V. A PORTION OF THE SMALLER RING OF THE IRIS, SEEN AND DELINEATED BY MEANS OF A MICRO- SCOPE. a. a. The arch, which the arteriolas of the iris form round the lesser annulus, designed in the preceding figure, tid. m.m,. b. b. Ramuli, running from those arches towards the pupil. c. c. Ramuli, running transversely in the annulus minor of> tlie iris, and led parallel with the ora pupillae, which some seem to Lave taken for orbicular fibres. . > Figure yi. VEINS OF THE EYE. A. A portion of the superior palpebra, deKnated in its passing. B. Lachrynal gland. C. Abducent muscle. D. Posterior part of the attollens, muscle cut off. • E. Anterior part. F. Posterior part of. the levator palpebra;, cut off. G. Anterior part. H. Superior oblique muscle, with the trochlea. 1. Optic nerve, erftering the optic foramen. K. Nerve of the fourth pair, L. First branch of the nerve of the fifth pair. a. Trunk of the ophthalmic vein coming'out of the receptaculum. b. Posterior ethmoid venula. c. Ramulus to the optic nerve, d. Superior ciliary vcnula. e. Three sUrculi, perforating the sclerotica, f. Ramuli, spread on the sclerotica, g. Inferior muscular ramus, h. Lachrymal branch. i. Anastomosing branch between the lachrynal and inferior.

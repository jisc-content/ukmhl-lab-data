( ) DIVISION, Into body and extremities, ITS PROMINENCES ARE SIX, THE WRIST. The carpus, or wrist, is formed of eight bones, wâ€™hich are tonnected to each other, and lie in a double row. THOSE AT THE UPPER EXTREMITY ARE 1, The olecranon, or anconoid process, situated posteriorly, 2. The coronoid apophysis, which is forwards. THOSE AT THE INFERIOR EXTREMITY ARE 4. The lower head, which is a little hallowed. 5. The neck of the lower head. 6. The styloid apophysis, near the lower head. \ THE CAVITIES ARE 1, The sigmoid cavity, which is between the anconoid and coronoid processes, and receives the trochlea of the humerus. CONNECTION WITH THREE BONES. 1. With the trochlea, by ginglymus. 2. . bones of the v\ rist, by arthrodia. r 3. radius, above and below, by trochoides. THE RADIUS. SITUATION. Between the fore-arm and hand. DIVISION Of the bones into a superior and an inferior row. IN THE SUPERIOR, From the thumb towards the little finger. Os naviculare. semilunare, cuncifoime. subrotundum, or orbiculare, IN THE INFERIOR ROW, From the thumb to the little finger. ' Os trapezium. multangulare majus. trapezoides minus, magnum, capitatum. unciforme. SITUATION. On the external side of the fore arm, towards the thumb. SHAPE. Is long. DIVISION. Into hody ; into superior, and into inferior extremity, which is thicker than the superior. PROMINENCES IN THE SUPERIOP. EXTREMITY ARE 1. The upper, or excavated head, which articulates with the headed condyle of the humerus. 2. A head for the biceps muscle, which is upwards, at the neck of the head. AT THE INFERIOR EXTREMITY. 3- The stjloid apophysis. THE CAVITIES ARE 1. The glenoid cavity, at the inferior extremity, which arti- culates with the wrist. CONNECTION. 1. With the headed condyle of the humerus. ' 2. With the ulna, at its upper and lower part. 3. With the bones of the hand. USE. To assist in constituting the fore-arm, to perform flexion, pronation, and supination. THE METACARPUS,- or HAND. SITUATION. Between the wrist and fingers. COMPOSITION. It is formed by five longitudinal bones: One for the thumb. Four others for the fingers. CONNECTION IS DOUBLE, t. With the wrist. 2. fingers. USE. To form the middle part of the hand. THE FINGERS. SITUATED At the inferior extremity of the hand. COMPOSITION. The thumb has two; and each finger three small bones, called phalanges. DIVISION Of the phalanges into superior, middle, and inferior. USE. form the fingers, which arc instruments of touch, defence, and labour.

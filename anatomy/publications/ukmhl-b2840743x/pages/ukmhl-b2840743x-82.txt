HISTORY OF MEDICINE. xl matter be very turgid, ('f/J wc must purge on the first day the disease appears; for, in such cases, dtTays are frequently dangerous. Those things which aie concocted, and digested, wc must move, or purge; (e) but those that arc indigested neither must wc purge, in the beginning of acute diseases, unless the vessels arc turgid, (f) In acute diseases, and in their beginning, (g) a purging medicine is seldom to be used; (h) neither must it be given, w'ithout the greatest judgment, and circumspection. Those things that are or have been justly determined by nature, ought not to be moved, (i) or altered, either by purging or irritating medicines, but should be let alone, f/rj But, whatever ought to be evacuated, it should be. drawn to that part where nature inclines, (1) through such passages and parts, as are most proper for their conveyance and expulsion, (m) If those things be discharged and purged which should be, it is good, (n) and the patient may easily bear it; (o) but if the contrary be evacuated, it is painfully endured. Things evacuated and purged, are not to be estimated by their multitude and quantity; (p) but by their fitness to be discharged. They must be such as the patient can easily support. Though, if necessary, we must evacuate, till the patient faints, if he can bear it. (q) Women, in a state of pregnancy, may be purged, (r) if the humours arc turged in the fourth month to the seventh, (s) but less in the latter months. But if the foetus be more or less advanced, we must carefully avoid it. (t) Those who do not thirst while they purge, by taking a purging potion, must not cease purging till they do thirst. A tormenting pain in the bowels, W'ithout a fever, a heaviness of the knees, and pain of the loins, signify that purging downwards is necessary. The gentle purges, used by Hippocrates, were, a decoction of the herb mercury, with an equal quantity of ptisan, and a small portion of honey, given at intervals. Sometimes cabbage and its juice, leaves of eider, (u) With a view of gently procuring stools, he likewise recommends a decoction of beet w'ilb honey, and of cabbage, with salt. But, he more fre- quently mentions asses milk for this purpose; and sometimes in so large a quantity as sixteen hemine, which are more than eight pints. Nor does he omit milk of cow's, goats, mares ; also clysters, and suppositories, of various compositions. Drastic pnrges were black and white hellebore, (x) peplium, colocynthis, grana cnidia, cneorum, elateruim, scammony, and thapsia. He observes, that those who are not easily purged upwards, (y) must, before the taking of hellebore, be well prepared with a moistening and plentiful diet, and rest, (z) Hellebore being taken, the body ought rather to be moved, (a) than allowed to sleep, or rest. For sailing on the sea, gives us a clear instance, and demonstration, (b) that our bodies are stimulated by motion ; and if hellebore be given to work more forcibly, move and stir the body, but when you w’ould check it, procure sleep, and do not move, (c) Hellebore is very dangerous to those who have a healthful boily, (d) for it causes convulsions, and a convulsion caused by Hellebore proves mortal, (e) Those who have pains above the diaphragm, require purging by vomit; (f) but if the pains be below the diaphragm, it signifies that purging downwards is necessary, (g) VOMITING (<2) 5 Epid.

These are ramuli, which, by different decus- sations, form a reticulun, or net-work, o. 470. 471. Rami, which meet the hypogastric, and mesente • ric nerves, coming from the great sympathetic.—Thus, from the radices ol the great visceral. No. 177, and of the accessory visceral nerve, in the right side of the body, arises the assemblage of ganglions, uncertain in number and size of the ganglion, to w'hich antiquity has affixed the name of Semilunar Ganglion.—This denomination is improper. There are more ganglions in the right and left side of the body, which are disseminated in that region of the aorta, where the coeliaca arises from it, and where ganglions of the right side are connected with those of the left side.—Hence, this numerous body may be, with more propriety, called Ganglia Cceliaca. 1. 1- 1. 1.

'third and following cervical pairs to their posterior branches, is much greater than those of the first and second pair: with justice, therefore, those denominated anterior branches, may be <:allcd Trunks. l6fi. Its first branch descending to the ansa of communi- cation with the descending ramus of the ninth pair, like No. J56.. 167. Second ramus of the third pair running down to the fourth pair, and phrenic nerve. 168. A small branch inserted in the trunk of the fourth pair. 169. Another ramus implanted into the diaphragmatic ncr.vc. 170. Third ramus of the third pair, which in the posterior margin of the cleido-mastoid muscle is divided into two ra- muli, of which tlic superior : 171. Unites with the superior branch of the fifth of the third pair, No. 187, and constitutes the nervus cutaneus medius colli., t 172. Inferior ramus arising from No. 170, which runs down in a straight direction in the sterno-mastoid muscle, distributed near the posterior margin, 173. Fourth branch of the third pair first descending a Lttle. After drawing back the anterior branch of the second and trunk of the third pair with the sterno-cleido-mastoideus mus- cle, there is a larger branch, in its natural situation, descend- ing behind llicse nerves. 174'. Its ramus going to the trimk of the fourth pair, 175. I7b. 177. 178. Another, and that a double anas- tamosis of ramus 173 with the trunk of the fourth pair ; for this anastamosis arises by two roots, 175, 176, from the ra- mus of the third pair already mentioned, which run together, and are again divided and inserted by two small branches, 177, 178, into the trunk of the fourth pafr. In the midst of its course, having made a conjunction, it represents a cross, and forms two cireun scriptiuns, or triangular islands. Ano- ther small branch, No. 175, 178, seems to come from ramus l73 to the fourth pair: but the other, No. 177, 176, by turns to ascend from the fourth pair. No.. 173, of the third pair. 179, 179. A small branch from 173, (or for the con- iunction of 170 with a branch. No. 177, of the fourth.pair) which accompanying the accossoruis of Willis, No. 149, tlC" sconding with the cucuUaris muscle, is united to it by two ra- jnuli 180. First, anastomosis of ramus 179, the acces- sorius, whidh arises with its root from the mentioned ramus 179,, and is inserted by two surculi into the accessory nerve. 181. Another anastomosis of branch 179, " ilh the accessory nerVe, No. 149- 182. The remaining part of ramus 173, which .again as- cendingj constitutes the small posterior auricular nerve. 183. Fifth ramus of the third pair, which, soon after its commencement, receives the ramus 158 of the second pair, 184. And sends off a branch, running in this body almost direclly downwai ds, near the posterior margin of the clcido- niiistoid, dividing.into two ramuli.. 185. Its external ramulus, joined with a branch of No. 210 I of the fourth pair. | 186. Another, or internal branch of it, united with a branch No. 212, of the fifth pair. 187. A ramus arising in the posterior margin of the cleido- mastoid muscle from No,183, which in those parts is inflected ll about the margin, and ascends upon the cleido and sterno- ji mastoid muscle on the exterior surface, and uniting with the No. 171, constitutes the nervus cutaneus medius colli. j 188. Another ramus in the posterior margin of the cleido- mastoid muscle proceeding from ramus 183, and there in- , fleeting, running above the cleido and sterno-mastoid muscle,. ^ as before mentioned, and forming the nervous cutaneus infc- j, rior colli. 189. The greatest ramus of the third pair, or trunk of the ,| third pair, which encreased by No. 157, 159, I6T, of the ,|, second pair, inflects to the posterior margin of the cleido-jjn mastoid muscle, and advances above the sterno-mastoid for-l jj wards and upwards, and then constitutes the nervus auricula-1 rus posterior, ^ ^ 190. Fourth pair of cervical nerves. * 191. First branch of the fourth pair, which, with a branch m of No. 169, of the third pair, constitutes the superior origins le of the phrenic nerve. da 192. 192, 192. 192. Descent of the phrenic nei vc. 193. 194. 195. Three branches of the phrenic nerve which are distributed in the second, or superior fleshy part of the diaphragii of the right side. 196. 197. Two remaining rami of the diaphragmatic 1 J" nerve which descended to the first fleshy part of the samel side. ^ J f 198. Second branch of the fourth pair running on the |1 right to the intercostal cervical trunk. J k 159- 199- Third ramus of tlie fourth pair, very thin, which' ® is distributed in the musculus scalenus medius, let. f. i 200. A deep seated branch of the fourth pair, (Winslow calls it posterior, §. I89.) 201. Its exterior branch descending to the interior surface of the musculus cucuUaris. ^ 202. Second ramus of the ramus profundus, No. 200, running to the infra-scapularis muscle. 203. Third small branch of ramus profundus. No. 200, proceeding to the inferior substance of the coraco-hyoidcus, 204. Fourth small branch of the ramus profundus. No. 200, stretching out of the supraspinatus; also many others from No. 201, 202, 203, 204, run down the interior surface of tha cucuUaris, and are inserted into the cucuUaris, and other muscles of the scapula, and also into the scalenus mo dius. 11 205. Exterior ramus of the fifth pair, or. mediuS' of, Win- slow, §. 110, p. m»185. 'I’his may also be called the anterior; and No. 200, poste-J,J rior. 206.

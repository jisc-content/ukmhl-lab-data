A muscle is a strong fibrous substance, used for motion. DIVISION Of a muscle into the head, which is its beginning, belly, middle, tail, extremity. ADHESION. The head and tail are most commonly connected with bones* SUBSTANCE OF A MUSCLE IS OF TWO KINDS; NAMELY, Fleshy at the belly. Tendinous at each extremity. Every muscle has many vessels and nerves. Aponeuresis, is the expansion of a tendon into a broad nous membrane. The action of a muscle consists in the contraction and relax- ation of its fleshy fibres. USE. Muscles constitute the organ of motion, by which all the different parts of the body are moved. MUSCLES

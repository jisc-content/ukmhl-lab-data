( 7° ) Figure II. Tins Second Figure represents the narrow vinculum of the great sympathetic neiwe of the right side with the sympa- thetic nerve of the left side, and the true, or last termina- tion of the arbores. I have retained the same numbers in the Second Figure, which were applied to the former Plate. V. Fifth vertebra of the loins. I. II. III. IV. V. Five spurious vertebrai of the os-sacrum. I. II. Spurious vertibrae of thd os-coccygis.—Yet it must be observed, that in this subject the os-coccygis is not formed by two, but consists of four spurious vertebraj. Thus the number II. comprehends the second, third, and fourth ver- tebrae, because the spino-coccygeus muscle, and ligament, adhere to the lateral margin of the os-coccygis, the third, and fourth cannot be well distinguished from the second. A. Lateral part of the first and second spurious vertebra of the o's-sacrum, almost to the foramina, from which the first and second sacral nerve go out here, cut off. B. Portion,of the ligamentum tuberoso-sacrum. C. Ligamentum spinoso-coccygjeum. D. D. D. Intestinum rectum, cut away near the muscles with the sphincter. 129. 130. Trunk of the great sympathetic nerve, or nervus anastomosus, between the fourth and fifth lumbar gang- lion. ' A 131. The first anastomosing branch. 132.

Anastomosis, between the second and third origin of the crural nerve. 141. Surculi of the cutaneous crural nerve. 142. The obturator nerve. 147. Third radix coming from the fourth pair of lumbar nerves. 149. The communicating root of the fourth lumbar nerve, 29, with the trunk of the great sympathetic nerve. ^ 345. Radices, arising from the trunk of the great sympathe- tic nerve, 129, 130, which compose the 346. Nervus communicaus, by which the great sympathetic nerve of the right side is Joined between the fourth and fifth vertebra of the loins behind the iliac arteries with the great sympathetic nerve of the left side. 347. Nerve, composed of radices. 348. 3d9. 350. Which preserve a conjunction with the trunk of the great sympathetic nerve of the left side, Plate XXXVIII. 356. The remaining trunk of nerve, 352, cut off, inserted into the first sacral ganglion of the left side. 373. to 376. Radices of the fourth and fifth lumbar nerves, which compose 377.

Second anastomosis, between the second and tb'ird sa- cral nerve, 395. Third anastoinosis, between the second and third sacral nerve. 396. First radix which the ischiatic neiwe receives from the second sacral nerve. w 397. 398. Second and third radix of the second sacral nerve, which 399.

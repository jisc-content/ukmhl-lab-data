( 59 ) Figure IV. r THE BODY OF AN ADULT DISSECTED, AND PLACED NEARLY IN THE SAME POINT OF VIEW AS FIG. I. IN THIS PLATE, EXHIBITS THE FOLLOWING AP- PEARANCES:— A. Radix of the mammillary process cut off. B. Root of the processus styli-formis, also cut off, C. Osseus meatus auditorius. D. Condyloid process of the inferior maxilla. E. Angle of the same maxilla. F. The lateral rectus muscle of the head. G. Transverse process of the first vertebra of the neck, H. Part of the inferior oblique muscle of the head. I. Part of the levator scapulae. K. Musculus rectus internus major of the head. I L. L. —■ scalenus prior. M. Part of the first rib. N. Anterior ramus of the first pair of cervical nerve*. O. — second pair of cervicals. I P. Trunk of the third pair of cervicals. I Q. Of the fourth pair of cervical nerves. I R. The diaphragmatic, or phrenic nerve. I S. Fifth pair of cervicai nerves. I T. Sixth pair of cervical nerves. I V. Combination of the fifth and sixth pair. I W. Seventh pair of cervical nerves. I X. Eighth pair of cervical nerves. I / y. First pair of dorsal nerves. I a. Ramus of the intercostal nerve, which descends above I the external surface of the carotis cerebralis, through I the foramen caroticum. I b. Another ramus, running above the internal surface of I the same artery. I c. d. Ganglion cervicale superius, which, in this body, I forms two protuberances.—c. The superior, d. The I inferior. I. f. g. Three ramuli, running from the anterior ramus of I the first pair of cervicals to that ganglion. ■ h.i. Two ramuli of the anterior ramus of the second I pair, which uniting, form I k. Nerve, inserted into the inferior protuberance of the I superior cervical ganglion. II. m. Two nervi molles, running from the superior protu- ■ berance of the ganglion. I n. Third nervus mollis, arising from the same place, but H a little lower, which runs downwards to the superficial ■ cardiac nerve. 0. Another, and firmer ramulus, forming the superficial cardiac nerve, arising from the lowest ahd anterior part of the inferior protuberance. p. Conjunction of the same with ramulus mollis, lit. n. q. q. Part of the intercostal nerve, placed between the superior and middle cervical ganglion. r. s. Two ramuli of the same, running to the superficial cardiac nerve. 1.1. Further progress of the superior cardiac nerve, u. Surculus of the same, running to nerve, lit. t. V. Another surculus of the cardiacus superficialis, going to the left side of the arteria innominata. w. X. Two other surculi of the same nerve, to be dispersed in the exterior surface of the arteria innominata and ' aorta. y. Insertion of the surculus of the anterior ramus of the second pair, lit. o, into the nervus intercostalis lit. q. q. Ganglion cervicale medium, conspicuous in this subject. «. (3. Two rami of the fourth pair, passing behind the rectus anticus major muscle of the head to the gang- lion medium. y. Third ramulus of the fourth, running above the infe- rior part of the mentioned muscle to the same gang- lion. J. £. First and second surculus of ganglion, lit. z, which, in descending, unite, and form the branch marked tj. Third ramulus of the ganglion. S 5. Surculus of the same, gqing to the ramulus of the first thoracic ganglion. No. 15, l7, almost in a direct line. X. Fourth ramulus of the ganglion cervicale medium. -jA. Place where ramuli w, and X, converging, meet Nerve, arising from the assemblage of those ramuli, u, and X. w. p. Two rami of the same.—w. Anterior, p. Posterior. r. Another conjunction of the anterior and posterior ramus. T. Surculus from the anterior ramus, carried dbwn- wards. ip. Insertion of the same into ramus, lit. ih. Ramus, from combination, lit. a, running a little for- wards. • u. Insertion of ramulus, No. 9, of ganglion cervicale in- ferior, into this ramus. 1. Combination of ramulus. No. 17, with nerve, lit. 4^. 2. Further descent of ramus, lit, 4/, after having received several additions. 3. Ganglion cervicale inferius. 4. Ramus

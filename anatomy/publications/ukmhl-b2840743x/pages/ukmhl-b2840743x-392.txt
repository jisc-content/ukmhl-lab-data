( M4 ) SnAPK. Irregular. DIVISION INTO THREE PARTS; NAMEIY, i. Palatine, which forms the palate. ‘2. Nasal, extending as far as the orbit. 3. Orbital, which projects into the orbit. PROMINENCES. 1. Pterygoid apophysis, which, by means of a di-pression, is joined to (he extremity of the pterygoid apophysis of the sphocnoidal bone, and connected with the tuberosity of A the maxillary bone. 2. A projecting line on the surface of the nasal .part of this bone, upon which the posterior extremity of the inferior spongy bone lies. CONNECTION WITH SIX BONES. 1. With its companion. 2. the maxillary. 3. sphoenoid. 4. ethmoid. 5. inferior, spongy. 6. vomer. 'use. To form the palate, cavity of the nose, and part of the orbit. THE VOMER. SITUATION. In the middle of the cavity of the nose, which it divides into two parts. 1 SHAPE. Resembles a plough share. DIVISION. Into two furfaces and four margins. The right and left sur» faces are towards the cavity of the nose. THE MARGlflS ARE 1. Anterior, to which the cartilage of the septum narium of the ethmoid bone is affixed. ■2. The posterior is toward the fauces. 3. Inferior, is received into grooves of the palatine, and maxillary phones. The right and left surface are toward the cavities of the nose. CONNECTION WITH FOUR BONES, AND ONE CARTILAGE; NAMELY, 1. With the sphenoid bone. 2. ethmoid. 3. superior maxillary. 4. palatine. 5. cartilage of the septum narium. USE. To support and divide the cavity of the nostrils. THE LOWER JAW-BONE. SITUATION. In the anterior part of the face. SHAPE. Like a horse-shoe. DIVISION. Into an external and internal surface, superior and inferior margin, body, and extremities. PROTUBERANCES. 1. The condyloid apophysis, which is received into the ar- ticulating fovea of the temporal bone. 2. The coronoid apophysis, which is pointed, and gives ad- hesion to the tendon of the temporal muscle. 3. The symphisis of this bone is a projecting line in tho middle of its body. 4. The alveolar margin, which has sixteen teeth. 5. The inferior margin, which forms the external and in- ternal lip. 6. The angles of the jaw, which are the extremities of the inferior margin on each side. CAVITIES. , 1. The semilunar nitch, which is between the condyloid, and coronoid apophysis. 2. The posterior maxillary foramen, or the internal surface. 3. The anterior maxillary foramen in the external surface. ' 4. The menial canal in the substance of this bone under the teeth, leading from the posterior to tJie anterior fo- ramen, and gives passage to the inferior ma.\illary nerve, the maxillary artery, and vein. 5. The sixteen alveoli, or sockets for the teeth, at the su- perior margin of this bone. CONNECTION. With the articulating fovea of the temporal bone; and with the os hyoidcs, by muscles. USE. It is the organ pf mastication. OF THE CAVITIES OF THE FACE, in particulah. Besides the cavity of the skull, there are five others in the head, formed by the bones of the skuH and face; namely, CAVITIES IN THE HEAD. 1. The orbits. 2. cavity of the nose. * ' 3. mouth. 4. fauces. cars

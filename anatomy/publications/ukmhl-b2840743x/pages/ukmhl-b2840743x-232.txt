( 26 ) PLATE XXIV. Basis oj the Cranium. A. Tentorium cerebelli, or lentorium of the cerebellum ; the part which comes to the anterior clinoid processes is removed. B. The longitudinal sinus of the dura mater. The poste- rior end is bifurcated; the interior and duplicated la- mina of the dura mater, which forms the falciform process; the lateral processes, and falx of the ccre- belhim, has peculiar cavities, which are called sinuses. The conjunction of the four greater sinuses is called torcular of Hcrophilus; the longitudmal sinus to the end, for the most pait, is a continuation of the other < sinus in tlve right transverse process, to which the other sinus is Joined belonging to the left transverse process^ these, are called lateral sinuses. fn that place, in which the longitudinal sinus is changed into the right lateral, another sinus is opened for a process of the cerebullum, which is called occipital; then another, which runs into the same place from the in- terior paj'ts of the cerebrum, venous, as it were, in its nature, and is called i\\efourth sinus, &c. C. The fourth bifurcated sinus; inserted into the right transverse crus, and into the left other crus; yet this is very rare. D. The remaining part of the falx cerebri. E. E. The great veins of the tentorium. F. The veins of the cerebrum, inserted by transverse sinuses in the tentorium cercbelli. G. The opening of the posterior occipital sinus» H. H. The right and left posterior occipital sinuses. I. Falx cerebelli; placed between the two lo)>es of the cerebellum. K. K. The great transverse, or two lateral sinuses. L. L. The jugular fossa:, or depressions; into these fossae, besides the trausverse, petrose, and occipital sinuses, are usually inserted the vertebral veins sent into the great jugular sinus by a peculiar meatus of the occipi- tal bone, as also other veins from the occipital dura piatcr, and frequently the mastoid. M.M. The inferior petrous sinuses', two inserted into these fossae. N. N. The superior petrous sinuses; two ascend on either side near the root of the petrous bone, and are inserted into the receptacula and jugular fossae. O. O. The veins inserted into these .sinuses of the cerebellum. P. P. The anterior and inferior occipital sinuses.. Q. Q Emmissarium passing out a nei-veof tlie ninth pair. Ernissaria are small veins, &c. R. R. Anterior and superior occipital sinus t perpetual. S. S. Its anastomosis with cavenous receptacula and circular sinus. T. The opening of the superior petrous into the cavernou.t. V.V. Receptacula, px cavernous sinuses; on the side tf the sella equina. X. X. 'I'he transverse sinus of the sella-cqvina.. Y. Y. The cirpul/ar sinus oi' Ridley. Z. Anterior veins of the cerebrum. - a. a. The principal artery of the dura mater.; ■ b. b. The veins which accompany it. d^d. The carotid arteries in the receptaculum. . 1 'll, I,.■ I . e. e. The little arfery in the receptacle to the nerves of the' fifth pair. f. f. Ophthalmic arteries, tlie origin from the carotid. g. g. The posterior anguiated cliwHd processes. h. Crista galli. i. i. Frontal sinuses. Ic. k. Nerves of the fifth pair. 1. The third branch, m. The second branch. K. The first branch, f. Ophthalmicus. 0. Nerve of the fourth pair. p. Nervous trunk of the third pair. q. The division, of the fifth pair from the sixth. r. Nerve of the sixth pair. s. Origin of the intercostal nerve. r i of 1.1. The entrance of the seventh pair into the dura mater, V. u. The first roots of the eighth pair. X. X. Heeund root of the eighth pair. y. y. Ninth nerve. z. Foramen of the medulla spinalis. t IN THE EIGHT EYE; AFTER THE LACUNAR OF THE. ORBIT, AND A GREAT PART «F THE OS MALjE HAVE BEEN DEMOLISHED. 1.1. Ophthalmic artery. 2. 2. An exterior, or lachrymal branch of the same, ac- companying the nerve. ^ 3. 3. Interior surculus extending to the nose. 4. 4. Braiiclu^s which go to the sclerotica,, some to the uvea., 5.5. The remains of the muscles of the palpebrm and eye. 6.

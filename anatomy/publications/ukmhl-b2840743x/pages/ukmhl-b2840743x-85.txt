xliii HISTORY OF MEDICINE, BOTANY. HIPPOCRATES has not left us any description of either plants or loots, (x) He mentions, in his works, about two hundred and thirty four herbs; but their description he left to Cratevas, whom he stiled the prince of botanists. Some fragments still remain, in the imperial library, which are considered as the productions of Cratevas. These, however, have been thought spurious, by some learned men. Dioscorides insinuates, that he gave but a very inaccurate and indifferent description, of roots and herbs. APOPLEXIES, CONVULSIONS, &c. APOPLEXIES happen, generally, between the age of forty and sixty. Convulsions, (z) according to his opinion, were occasioned, either by repletion, or evacuation. Hiccoughing likewise, arises from the same causes; (a) and a con- vulsion, or rigor, after a violent heat, is bad. He considered, a convulsion occasioned by a wound of the head, and like- wise, (b) from a drastic purging potion, to be fatal. In convulsions, Hippocrates endeavoured to make the patient sneeze. In his book De Locis Homin. is ordered a fire to be made, on both sides of the patients bed; and mandrake root in a very small quantity; (c) and bags were applied very hot, to the tendons behind; but he does not specify what tendons. Internally was given, some pepper and honey mixed together. DROPSY. THOSE who have griping pains in the belly, (d) and violent pain about the naval, which cannot be removed by purging remedies, or any other means, are very likely to be afflicted with a dropsy, (e) After a leuco-phlegmatia, likewise comes a dropsy. A cough coming to those who have a dropsy, is bad; (f) and ulcers appearing in those who have a dropsy, are exceedingly difficult to cure, (g) He observes, that if the water of one who has a dropsy flows from the veins into the intestines, the disease is removed, (h) A diarrhoea, he likewise says, cures a dropsy. The danger of discharging the water suddenly, (i) beseems well apprized of. If corruption, (Ic) or water, mixed to- gether, flow out all at once, from those that are opened for the cure of the empyema, or dropsy, the patients will cer- tainly die. If a dropsical patient is afflicted with a difficulty of breathing, (o) and this should happen in the spring, if the person be young and robust, a proper quantity of blood must be taken from the arm. A person labouring under a dropsy, ought to fatigue himself by exercise to sweat; (m) to eat bread; to drink little; and that of white wine; to sleep moderately ; and to use purgatives; by which means the water and phlegm are evacuated. There are two sorts of dropsies, one called anasarca, which is not to be avoided when coming; the other arising from wind, which is not to be cured but by great good fortune, and requires abundance of exercise; hard labor; and fo mentations; very temperate diet; using things dry and sharp. His purges, in this disorder, were hellebore, elaterium, &c; He mentions the dropsy of the liver and spleen, and recommends hellebor for this last. As a diuretic, he used cantliarides inwardly.

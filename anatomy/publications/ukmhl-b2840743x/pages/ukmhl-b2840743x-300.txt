Ramus, which nervus, 322, anastomoticus sends off, by which the sympathetic nerve of the right side, bejiind the aorta, a little above the origin of the inferior mesenteric artery, is joined with the sympathetic nerve of the left side, as Plate XXXVIII. will more clearly elucidate. 323. Surculus of the hypogastric ramus, passing into the in- terlumbar artery. - ' 324. 324. Anastomosis of the hypogastric ramusi with nerve, 117.—From this anastomosis, arises 325.

Ramus hypogastricus of the third’ radix of the sympathetic nerve, 300, which forms the hypogastric plexus. 330. Internal ramus of the hypogastric nerve. 331. Anastomosis of it, with nerve 329* 332. Anastomosis of the internal ramds, 330, with 315.— AVe shall see the further progress of this nerve better repre- sented in Plate XXXVII. 333. External ramus of nerve, 328. 334. to 336. Anastomosis of the external ramus with nerve, 329. 337. Ramus cut off, which anastomoses with rami, consti- tuting the inferior mesenteric and hypogastric plexus, as Plate XXXVII. will demonstrate. 338. Ramus hypogastricus of the third lumbar ganglion, 98. 339- 339. Anastomosis of this nerve, with nerve, 333. 340. Surculus arteriosus of nerve, 338, passing into mem- brane of»the iliac artery, 341. Arterial, or anterior ramus of the hypogastric nerve, 338. 342. Ramus, migrating to the muscular membrane of the crural artery. 343. Ramus, going to the muscular membrane of the hypo- gastric artery. 344. Posterior, or anastomotic ramus of nerve, 338, with the trunk of the great sympathetic nerve. 345. 345. Radices, arising from the trunk of the great sym- pathetic nerve, 129, 130, which compose 346. 347. The communicating nerve, which the sympathetic nerve of the right side, between the fourth and fifth \ ertc- bra of loins behind the iliac arteries, is joined with the great sympathetic nerve of the left side, as we shall sec better in Plate XXXVII. and Plate XXXVIll. 348. to 350. Radices, arising from the fifth lumbar gang- lion, which 351. Run into one nerve, anastomosing with the trunk of the great sympathetic nerve of the left side, and which is joined by an elegant anastomosis, with the trunk of the great sympathetic nerve of the leftside.—Plate XXXVI. Fig. II. 3.—and Plate XXXVIll. 351. 352. Ramus anastomoticus of nerve, 159> 353. 353. Dividing into two rami; at length is joined into one trunk, from which 354. 355. Two anastomoses run out with nerve, 358. 356. The remaining trunk of nerve, 352, cut off: it is in- serted into the first sacral ganglion of the left side. 357. Ramus, arising from nerve, 154, which disperses sur- culi to the muscular membrane of the rami of the hypo- gastric artery. , 358. 358.

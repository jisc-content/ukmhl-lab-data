The vapor of the tunica vaginalis testis, which is aqqeous. IN THE GENITALS OF WOMEN. 1. The mucus of the vagina and urethra, secreted by the glands of these parts. 2. The liquor of the odorifei'ous glands, situated in the labia pudenda. ' 3. The menstrual blood, which is secreted by the arteries in the cavity of the uterus, monthly. 4. The lochia, which is effused from the cavity of the uterus tor some days after delivery. 5. The liquor of the amnion, which, during the time of preg- nancy, surrounds the foetus in a membranous ovum of the uterus. IN THE FOETUS. The meconium, or black fajces, which are contained in the great intestines. IN THE ARTICULATIONS. . 1. The synovia, which is secreted in the cavities of joints. 53 ) 2. The liquor of the sheaths of tendons, or burses mucosa-, which is like a thin oleous mucus. IN THE BONES. 1. The medulla, or marrow of bones, or fatty substance, contained in the middle, or cavity of cylindrical bones. 2. The medullary liquor, which is an oleous tluid in the ca- vernous substance of bones. IN THE COMMON INTEGUMENTS. 1. The Malpighian mucus, in cellulm, under the epidermis, which, in Europeans, is white; in -/Ethiopians, black, &c. 2. The liquor of the subcutaneous glands, which is oleous and enters the skin by- the ducts of these glands. 3. The juice of the hair, which is contained in the cavity of the hair, from which it receives its colour. 4. The perspirable liquor, which, in form of an invisible vapour, is continually exhaling from the exhalent ar- teries of the whole surface of the skin. 5. The oil of the adipose membrane, which is secreted every where by the lateral pores of arteries in the tela ccl- lulosa, or cellular membrane ; and in the omentum, the veins return superfluity. THE SUBSTANCES OF ANIMALS, CONTAIN, IN DIFFERENT DEGREES, ACCORDING TO CHEMICAL ANALYSES, &c. Extruded from the recent and most excellent Chemists: 1. Fibriiia. 2. Albumen. 3. Gclaline. 4. Mucilage. 5. Urea. 6. Sugar. 7. Oils. 8. Resins. 9. Sulphur. 10. Phosphorus. It. Acids. 12. Alcalis. 13 Earths. 14. Metals. These are all discoverable by dilferent experiments; but as the substances which produce these results cannot, in general, be applied to the internal surface of the human stomach, or by other means, when living, to answer important purposes in the cure of diseases : the major part become respectable, as curious speculations, which may, at some future period, be converted to very important uses. 2. Albumen. 5. Phosphats of soda. 3. Gelatine. 6. ammenia. 4. E.xtract. 7. lime, and carbon of ditto. * MEMBRANES Are composed chielly, according to Hatchett, of coagulated albumen. Membranes and tendons make that strong cohesive substance, glue. CUTICLE AND CUTIS Are chiefly composed of galatine. NAILS Are similar, or possessing the quality of coagulated albumen. , HAIR 'Resembles the preceding substances, with a little sulphur. THE CRUOR OF THE BLOOD THE SIMPLE SUBSTANCES, FOUND IN ANIMALS, C.OXSIST OF THE FOLLOWING, IN V.VRIOUS PROPORTIONS: 1. Azot. 6. Lime. 11. Magnesia. 2. Carbon. 3 Hydrogen. 4. O.cygen. b. Phosphorus. 7. Sulphur. 8. Soda. 9. Potass. lO. Bluriatic acid. 12. Silica. 13. Iron. 14. Manganese. BRAIN, Contains phosphat of lime, of soda, and ammoniaâ€”but no oil, there- fore not like soap, &c. HUMAN BONES, Is one part to three of serum, but liable to variation in different subjects and conditions. BLOOD CONTAINS, FROM ANALYSIS, 1. Water. 6. Soda. 2. Fibrina. ~ 7. Sub-phospliat of iron. 3 Gelatine. 8. Miiriat of soda. 4'. Albumen. . 9. Phosphat of soda. 5. Hydrosulpliurct of ammonia. 10. lime. The states of diseased blood do not appear evident by chemical analysis; but blood undergoes numerous changes, which medical practice and inspection fully demonstrate, in various diseases, without chemical analysis. FROM A EVRYINC-CROUND, OUT OF 100 PARTS, CONTAIN, Of gelatine, 16. Phospliat of lime, 67. Carbon of lime, 1-5. Lost, 15-5. BRY, BUT NOT FROM UNDER THE EARTH: 23 Gelatine. 63 Phosphat of lime. 2 Carbon of lime. 2 Loss, IN MUsCLES: 1. Are cliiefly composed of fibrina, to which they owe their fibrous structure and form; also. BUFFY APPEABANCB, OR THE SURFACE OF BLOOD, ACCORDING TO Deyeux and Parmentier,: The huffy coat of inflammation, consists of the fibrina. The cruor, deprived of this substance, is much softer than usual, and almost totally soluble in water. The albumen of the serum is also altered, and does not coagulate as usual, when heated, but becomes milky, wheu lui.xed with hot water. R r In

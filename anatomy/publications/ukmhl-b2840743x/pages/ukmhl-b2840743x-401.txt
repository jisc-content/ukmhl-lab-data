( 123 ) CONNECTION WITH TWO BONES. I 1. With a sinus of the condyles of the femur. 2. With the spine of the tibia, by ligaments. j USE. To give articulation to the knee, and to act as a common 1 pulley for the tendons of the extensor muscles of the I tibia. I ■ ' ? I THE TARSUS, or INSTEP. j SITUATION. Between the leg and foot. SHAPE. The superior part headed ; inferior, broad. COMPOSITION . Is of seven bones, which are placed in a double row. I IN THE FIRST ROW. I The astragalus, which is the most superior; the os calcis, which is the most inferior. IN THE SECOND ROW. The os naviculare, near which, on the internal side, the os cubiforme. : iFhere are three ossa cuneiformia, which are connected to- gether. THE PROMINENCES ARE I, The head of the astragalus, between the malleoli, (ancles) joined to the head of the tibia. |j. The tuberosity of the os calcis, into which the tendo achillis is inserted, chiefly underneath. I ' USE. To form the base of the foot, and assist in its motion. THE METATARSUS, or FOOT. SITUATION. Between the tarsus and toes. I DIVISION. Into superior and inferior surface. COMPOSITION. Is of five bones, called metatarsal. I USE. i'o form the superior and inferior part, or sole of the foot. ! THE TOES. I COMPOSITION. he great toe has two phalanges; and each of the others consist of three. SESAMOID BONES. *' These are minute bones, like peas, situated between the phalanges of the thumb and great toe. SYNDESMOLOGY, or DOCTRINE of the LIGAMENTS. ON SYNDESMOLOGY IN GENERAL. THE PARTS WHICH SYNDESMOLOGY TREATS OF ARE 1. The external periosteum. 2. internal ditto. 3. medullary substance in bones. 4-. cartilages. 5. articular glands. 6. synovia. 7. vessels of bones. 8. nerves of bones. 9. ligaments. THE EXTERNAL PERIOSTEUM. This is a membrane, covering the external’surface of all bone, except the corona;, or external part of the teeth. THE DIFFERENT NAMES ARE 1. Pericranium, on the skull. 2. Periorbita, in the orbits. 3. Perichondrium, on cartilages. 4. Peridesmium, on ligaments. SUBSTANCE. Is a fibrous membrane, filled with arteries and veins. COHESION. The inferior surface, by means of its vessels, adheres to the pores of the bones. ' The superior surface is connected with the cellular membrane and muscles. USE. To contain the calcareous, or other substance of the bone; and distribute vessels, as arteries, veins, nerves, &c. in their proper order for its growth and nourishment. THE INTERNAL PERIOSTEUM. This is a membrane, covering the internal surface of bones: very much like the external. I THE

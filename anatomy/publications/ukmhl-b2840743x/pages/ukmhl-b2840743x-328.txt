( 86 ) 4 VQ. Second anastomosis of nerve, 432, with nerve, 4-31. 450. Third anastomosis of nerve, 432, with nerve, 431. 451. Fourth anastomosis of nerve, 432, with nerve. 431. 4.52. to 455. Surculi oesophagei of nerve, 431. When nerve, 32, as the trunk of the left par vagum has made so many anastomoses with the par vagum of the right side, and with the other rami of the left par vagum; then it passes through the sphincter oesophagei, from the thorax into the abdomen, and becomes 456’. The anJ#;rior trunk of a plexus of nerves of the stomach and liver. ^ 457. First anastomosis of nerve, 431, with 430, from which run 458. A surculus on the oesophagus. 459. Second anastomosis of nerve, 431, with nerve, 430. 460. 460.; Rami oesophagei of nerve 431. 461. 461. Ramus of the right par vagum, conveyed down from the right cavity of the thorax into the left. 462. 462. 463. Two surculi of the right par vagum, 164. 464. See. Running into one large branch, which, behind the oesophagus, as trunk of the right par vagum, is carried from the right cavity into the left, where this, andhicrve, 461, form various anastomose with rami of the left par vagum. Nerve, 461,, is divided into two rami'i^. 465. The first is almost aortic; for it distributes 466. dic. The first surculus to the membrane of the aorta. 467. Second aortic surculus.. 468. Third. 4(19. Fourtli. 470. Fifth. Resides the aortic rami, 471. .A surculus runs from nerve, 462, which 472. Forms an anastomosis, with 431. 473. Disappears in the oesophagus. ^ 474. Tlie second ramus of nerve, 46l, is bifid, of which 475. One part separates into two anastomotic sureuli>. 476. 476. With a trunk of nerve, 464,. and 477. With nerve,.430. 478. Another migrates to the ganglion ccsophageum, 479. Having before made an anastomosis with nerve, 430., 480. 48. Anastomosis, between nerve, 430, and 464., 481. Ramus of nerve, 430,' running to the ganglion oeso- phageum. Thus, from three rami, 431, 478, and 481, is composed ' 482. The ganglion oesophageum, which 483. 484. 485. Gives three rami to the oesophagus. * When nerve, 430, has sent out the rami, mentioned above, it is joined w(jth the trunk of the right eighth pair, 464; so that after it has penetrated through the sphincter of the diaphragm, it becomes 486. The posterior trunl? of the rami of the stomach an liver; or, as we usually say, the posterior trunk of the plexus of the .ventriculus and liver.—Tlic trunk, thus formed, is divided into two^rincipal rami. 487. The first ramus immediately divides into two surculi. 488. Sec. The former is inserted into the left tenth coeliac ganglion, 253, and emits 439. The gastric anastomosing branch. 490. The ofiicr ramus of nerve, 487, is gastric. 491. 492. Which divides into two surculi, of which the one, marked 492, anastomoses with nerve, 49O.—At length one of tlie rami 493. to 496. Is terminated in the posterior surface of the cardia. 4^7. Second ramus of the posterior trunk, 486, is sub- divided into five rami. 498. The first is gastric ; this, after anastomosing 499. With nerve, 490, is finished 500. 501. In the posterior surface by two surculi. 502. Second anterior ramus of nerve, 497, is gastric, which is distributed in the anterior surface of the cardia. 503. 503. Third ramus of the Second branch of the posterior trunk, 486, is divided into 504. The posterior gastric ramus, terminated in the posterior surface of the superior curvature of the ventricle, and into 505. Ramus hepatico-gastricus.—The ramus hepatico-gas> tricus is divided into 506. 506. The ascentling hepatic ramus, which,, as Plate XXXIX. demonstrates, is terminated in the hepatic ple.xus, and 507. 507. Descending gastricus, which accompanying the left superior coronary artery, runs to the superior ora of the ventricle. 508. 509. Fourth .and fifth ramus of nerve, 497, contribute 1 oform the gastric plexus. '•j

(. 96 ). PLATE XLVI. The Muscles of the Bulb of the Eye, Figure T. MUSCLES, WITH THE LEVATOR PALPEBIIJE SUPEUIORIS. «. The bulb of the eye. b. The optic nerve in its cavity. c. The optic nerve cut oft' without the orbit. d. Portion of the dura mater, which leaves the optic nerve, and falls into the periosteum of the orbit. e. The levator palpebrae superioris, arising from an an«le of the division of the dura mater, and terminating in a broad aponeurosis. f. The attollens, the greatest part covered by the levator palpebrtE. g. The obliquus superior inflected through the trochlea. k. The insertion of the obliquus inferior. i. The depriment muscle. k. The abducent, arising by a double head. l. The lesser superior head. m. The inferior head. The interval between the heads, through which the nerves collected into a fasciculus arc terminated, a. The first branch of a nerve of the fifth pair. j>. From which first branch of the lachrymal branch is cut oflf. q. The frontal branch divided. r. The nasal branch. a, A surculus of the nasal branch, which constitutes the long root of the ophthalmic ganglion. t. A nerve of the third pair. u. A nerve of the sixth pair. Figure II. THE MUSCLES OF THE EYE, WITHOUT THE LEVATOR PALPEBRiE. а. The bulb of the eye. б. The optic nerve within the orbit, r. The optic nerve without the orbit. d. Portion of the dura mater, which goes into the periosteum. t. Ihe ievafor palpebrae cut away near its origin. j. The superi(U' oblique muscle, inflected through the trochlea. g. The attolent muscle. h. Its tendon dilated near the insertion. «. '1 he adducent muscle. k. Both the mucles, near their rise, are so connected with each other, that.it should shew the levator palpebnc in its origin, not to pertain to the vagina of the optic nerve, but placed on both. l. The depriment muscle. 7H. The abducent muscle. «. 'I’he superior head connected with the attollent. 0. The inferior head. p. The interval between each head. Figure III. THE COMMOW TEVDOV, FROM WHICH THE ADDUCENT, ABDUCENT, AND DEPRIMENT MUSCLES .ARISE. a. The optic nerve cutaway near its entrance. b. The broken osseous septum between the optic for men, and round commencement of the sphenoid fissu e. c. The dura mater cut away at its entrance into the peri- osteum of the orbit. d. The Rttollent muscle, arising from a divis oi of the dura mater cut away. e. The levator palpebne superioris cut away. f. The common tendon, from which the three muscles, viz. the adducent, abducent, and depriment arise. g. g-. g-. Tendinous expansions, arising from the ligamentum commune, going to their muscles. k. The abducent muscle. i. The epriment muscle. k. The adducent muscle. Figure W, THE SUPERIOR OBLIQUB MUSCLE. c. The optic nerve moved from its situation, and inflected downwards, the better to shew the origin of the ob- liquus superior. b. The abducent muscle cut away. c. The internal between the heads of this muscle. d. The attollent muscle cut aw ay near its commencement. e. The insersion ot this muscle into the bulb of the eye. f. The levator palpebrre cut off. g. The adducent muscle cut away. h. The origin of the superior oblique muscle, from the pe- riosteum of the parietes of the internal part of the o bit. i. The tendon inflected through the trochlea. k. The trochlea. l. The tendon, gradually dilated near its insertion, m. The insertion of the obliquus inferior. Figure V. THE INFERIOR OBLIQUE -MUSCLE. a. The bulb of the eye. b. The abducent muscle. c. The depriment muscle. d. The inferior oblique muscle, arising from the anterior ora of the orbit. €, The insertion of this muscle into the bulb of the eye.

( 120 ) SHAPE. It resembles the letter S. DIVISION. It is distinguished by anterior and posterior extremity ; su- perior and interior surlace. ITS CAVITIES ABE A groove for the subclavian vessels on the inferior surface. CONNECTION. The anterior extremity is connected with the sternum, by synchondrosis; and the posterior with the scapula, by arthrodia. USE. To connect tlie scajmla and humerus with the thorax ; and to defend the subclavian vessels. THE SCAPULA. SITUATION. ' At the upper part, and side of the back. DIVISION. Into two surfaces, which are the posterior, or external; the anterior, or internal; three margins, namely, superior, external, internal; and three angles, the superior external; superior internal; inferior. THE OS HUMERI. SITUATION. Between the scapula, and fore arm. DIVISION. Into body and extremities : one superior, the other inferior. THE PROMINENCES ARE (aT THE SUPERIOR EX- TREMITY.) 1. The head of this bone. 2. The neck, under the head. 3. The larger tuberculum behind. 4. The smaller ditto before, which are under the head of this bone. AT THE INFERIOR EXTREMITY THERE ARE THREE CONDYLES : 1. The external. 2. The internal, which are for the adhesion of the flexor, and extensor muscles.â€”All flexors arise from the ex- ternal contlyle, and all extensors from the internal. 3. The headed condyle for articulation with the radius. A trochlea of the humerus for articulation with the fore- arm. THE CAVITIES IN THE UPPER EXTREMITY ARE THE PROMINENCES ARE 1. Lips of the external margin, which arc likewise called the base of the scapula. 2. The neck of the scapula, which forms the superior exter- nal angle, and is situated under the articulating cavity. 3. The spine is a process, dividing the posterior surface. 4. The acromion is the anterior part of the spine. 5. The coracoid apophysis, projects into the anterior and su- perior part of the articulating cavity. THE CAVITIES ARE 1. The articulating cavity at the neck of the scapula, which receives the neck of the humerus. 2. The fovea of the acromion, which adheres to the clavicle. 3. The supra-spinal depression, which is above the spine. 4. The infra-spinal cavity below the spine. The spine is at the posterior part. CONNECTION WITH FOUR BONES. With the clavicle, by arthrodia. os humeri, by arthrodia. USE. To defend the back, and give articulation to the humerus. A groove, or sulcus of the tubercles for one head of the biceps muscle. AT THE INFERIOR EXTREMITY. The posterior fossa for the aconoid process of the ulna. The anterior fossa for the aconoid apophysis of the ulna. CONNECTION WITH THREE BONES. 1. With the scapula, by arthrodia. 2. ulna, by ginglymus. 3. radius, by double ginglymus. SUBSTANCE Is three-fold compact in the body; spongy at each extremity; reticular internally. USE. To form the arm. THE ULNA. SITUATION. At the internal side of the fore-arm towards the little linger. SHAPE Is long, thicker at the upper than at the lower extremity. PIVISION.

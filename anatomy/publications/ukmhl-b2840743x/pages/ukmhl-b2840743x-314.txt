I In all the dissections of dead bodies of both sexes, and all ages, I know that the thoracic phrenic nerve frequently anastomoses in the right side of the body with the coeliac ganglions of the great sympathetic nerve; yet there are not wanting, examples, although they seldom occur, w lie re no connexion subsists between the phrenic and groat sytn- pathetic nerve; In the loft side, it is otherwise. How frequently is a conjunction of the phrenic tlu)iacic nerve with the great sympathetic nerve deficient; and this should, seem to be a natural state. Nor is the union of the phrenic thoracic, in the cavity of the abdomen, with the nerve of the eighth pair.-—I will mention only three examples, out ’ of the vast number of Observations which I, have made, lest I be troublesome to the Reader., FIRST OBSERVATION- IS TAKEN EaOM A MAN ABOVE TWENTY YEARS OLD. The course of the phrenic nerve, in the right side, yet inr eluded in the cavity of the abdomen, was divided into internal andcxternal thoracic rami. The

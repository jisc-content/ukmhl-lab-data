Nervus spennaticos externus of the left aide, which, as in Plate XXXVI. Fig. I. 86, to 95, runs partly to ^he uterus with the ligamentum rotun- dum i aaotber part carried through the abdominal ring, disappears in the skin of the mens venerus. 132. 14-0. 148. 14-9' 150. Ner\-c, anastomosing between the first and second left lumbar nerve. 162. 163. Rami of the second left lumbar nerve in the qua- dratus lumborum. 16-k 165. Ramus of the second left lumbar nerve, going to the quadratus of the loins. 166. 167. A cutaneous branch of the two left lumbar oerve. It runs obliquely under the external crus of the descendens muscle of the abdomen, externally; disappears in the cutis wliich covers the inguinal glands. 1^3. 1'69. 170. Muscular rami, which the second lumbar nerve sends to the major and minor psoas muscle. 171. 172. The external cutaneous nerve of the knee, arising from the second left lumbar nerve. 175. 176. 177. Rami of the second lumbar nerve, consumed in the psoas mjyor. 178. The obturator nerve. l79-180. First radix of the obturator nerve wliicli the second lumbar nerve exhibits. 181. 182. Second radix of the obturator nervCj arising from the third lumbar nerv'e. 183. Third radix, which the obturator nerve receives from the fourth lumbar nm-e. 184. The crural nerve. 185. First radix of the crural nerve, which the second lumbar oei-ve sends. 186. Second radix of the crural nerve, arising from the third lumbar nerve. 187. 187. Third radix, arising from the fourth lumbar inorvB. 188. 18^. A bramch of the crural nerve, migrating to the external iliac muscle. 190.191- Anastomosis, between the third and fourth lumbar nerve. 192. l^erve, arising from the seventh thoracic ganglion, im- planted in the fifth intercostal artery. 193. 19‘1'- Two nervous surcuU, arising from the seventh tho- racic ganglion, immediately 195. Are united into one trunk, which now 196. 197. Is expanded on the muscular coat ef the aorta. 198. Ramus, which the thoracic ganglion sends partly 199. To the-siKth intercostal artery, partly 200. To the aorta. 5^01. 202, An aortic branch, arising from the ninth thoracic ganglion. 803. Ramus aortic us, arising from the ninth thoracic gang- lion, which immediately is divided into two rami. 204. First, migrates to the aorta, 205. Second, is joined with 206. 206. Nerve, which arises from the twelfth thoracic ganglion; therefore, from the conjunction of these rami, 207. 208. 209. Arise three surculi, of which two, 207, and 208, are terminated in the muscular tunic of the aorta; but the third, 209, forms a beautiful anastomosis with the fourth left coeliac ganglion. ’ 210. 211. Anastomosis, between the tenth thoracic ganglion, and the eleventh intercostal nerve. 212. 213. Two surculi from the trunk of tlie great sympa- thetic, which 214. Uniting into one nerve, going to the ninth intercostal artery. T215. 216. 217. 218. Principal trunk of the thoracic nerve. 219- First radix of the principal visceral nerve, spring up from the trunk, 52, of the nervus sympathetic. 220. Second radix, which the principal visceral nerve re- ceives from the eighth thoracic ganglion, 43. 221. Tliird, which the ninth thoracic ganglion sends to the principal visceral nerve, 44. The visceral nerve now descends from the thorax into the Ab- domen, whether its passage be between the external and middle appendix of the diaphragm, or between the middle and internal appendix, or as often as there are only two appendices of the diaphragm between the e.xternal and in- ternal appendix. 222. i?82. to 226. Is dirldod into many rami, <(in this body into five) whkdi soon after unite, and swell into one of the coeliac ganglia. 227. 228. Trunk of the accessory sympathetic nerve, arising from the tenth tlioracic giinglion. 229. Anastomosis, between the principal fplanehnic and ac- cessory nerve. When the trunk of the accessory visceral nen^c migrates fitnm the cavity of the thorax,^ into the cavity of the abdoraea,* in the same manner as in tli« subject. 230. to 235. It separates into six surculi, which, like prin- cipal visceral nerves, are ibrmed into one or ofther cceliac ganglion. 286. 236. Radix singularis, Which the eleventh thoracic gangliun sends to the second loft ctnliac ganglion, 246. 237. 237. Posterior renal nerve, which is divided into two ramd. 238. The first forms an anastomosis, as under: 239. With the first left caliac ganglion, 244; > 240, With the renal ganglion; 241. With the renal ganglion. 242. 243. Second ramus of the posterior penal nervD, con- tributes to form the left renal ganglion.—^Thus, from the a’isceral uei’ves, the principal, 216. 217. 218. The secondary, 227, 228. Wit!

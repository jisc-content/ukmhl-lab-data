( 4S ) 15U Surculus, which this branch sentU off to the posterior surface of the carotid, and artcria innoiniaata. 192. A ramification of No, 19O, descendin':: fartlwjr l^ehind tlic subclavian artery; at length to be combined with nerve, No. 268, of the eighth pair.—(See No. 269.) 193. Surculus, encreasing No. 248, the preceding nerve, by its accession. ^ 194. The remaining portion of nerve, No. I90, to which the following 195. Is joined to No. 251. 196. Nerve, formed by the combination of No. 194, and 251, descending above the subclavian and innominata: to be called the cardiacus superlicialis, 197. First, and inferior branch of the same, whieW soon sends off 198., A surculus to the vena cava, 199* Conjunction of the ramification, No, 197, with a small branch. No, 267, of the recurrens.—Hence, these nerves combined, proceeding farther in their course, send off 200. A branch, which, then dividing into two parts, forms a surculus to nerve, No. 231 ; and 201. Running into another surculus above the aorta, goes to the pericardium, 202. Connexion of surculus. No. 213, and of the re- maining part of ramulus. No. 197, whence is emitted 203. A surculus, terminating pn the anterior surface of the arch of the aorta. 204. Another surculus, turning to the right side of the aorta. 205. Lastly, the remaining portion, which goes over the anterior-surface of the aorta, by running on the left; but ih its passage fbrms 206. A surculus, uniting by anastomosis with the ramifica- tion, No. 233; and 207. And another surculus, terminated on the anterior surface of the aorta, 208. 209, Two surculi, the ends of nerve, No, 197, in- flected on the right about the aorta. 210. Second, or superior surculus of nerve. No. 196, running above the arteria innominata, to be distributed on its left side. 211. Third surculus, distributed on the anterior surface of the arteria innominata. 212. Fourth branch of nerve, No. 196', which sends off 213. A ramification, anastomo-singwith No. 199, (marked 202.) 214. 215. 216. 217. Four surculi, from No. 212, dis- sh^uted on the ^tehor surface of the arteria innominata. and aorta; the superior. No. 214, goes to the left side of the innominata. , 218. PostcM'ior branch of the intercostal trunk, which, in descending behind the inferior thyroid artery, forms 21.9. Another ganglion cervicale iuferius, and posterius, covered, for the most part, by the inferior thyroid. 220. 221. Two surculi, sent out of the superior part of the ujforior and posterior ganglion, stu rounding the anterior sur- face of the inferior thyroid. 222. The conjunction of the anterior surculus with ramus, No. 1S6, whence 223. A common branch, arising from No. 186 and 220, which in its course runs downwards. 224. Another insertion of the posterior surculus of the same ganglion, intx> the inferior part: thus surculus. No. 221 r and the inferior, or posterior cervical ganglion, form an annu- lus, intercepting the inferior thyroid artery. 225. Posterior intercostal branch, which immediately di- vides in two parts, and sends off 226. Anterior branch, increased in its progress by No. 223. 227. Ganglion parvum cervicale, imum, (perhaps it may. be called the cardiac) which the united ramifications swelling No. 223 and 226, produce 228. A branch of the mentioned ganglion, which, running downwards above the subclavian artery, bends in its lowest margin on the left, and interiorly, and is concealed, in part, under the artcria innominata. 229* In this place the ramus. No. 228, again emerges. 230. Conjunction of it with the descending branch, No. 80, covered by the carotid artery and the innominata; and in this figure marked with dots. 231. A nerve, originating from the combination of the, branches, No. 180, and 230. 232. Insertion of surculus, No. 200, into the preceding, nerve. 233. Anterior ramification which nerve. No. 231, gives out. 234. Two of its scurculi, going to the pericardium. 235. Union of the ramifications, No. 206, and 233. 236. Superior surculus of the anterior branch. No. 233, running above the aorta on the left. 237. The middle surculus, stretching to the pericar- dium. 23d-. Inferior ramulus, giving off several surculi to the pe- ricardium. 239. Nerve, No, 231, farther in its progress, entering the aorta. 240. Postexiof branch of nerve. No. 225, which re- ceives 241.

( 64 ) 15*). Second thick radix of the first sacral nerve, communi- •cating with the trunk of the great sympathetic nerve, 138. The first communicating radix, 155, and 15(J, must be considered only as the first sacral ganglion. The second figure shews the usual form and connections of the first sa- cral ganglion on the left side. 160. Anastomosis, between the first, 156, and second radix of the first sacral nerve. 161. 1(52. lfi3. Three radices, arising from the second sacral pair, and going to the second, 157, sacral ganglion. lt>4'. Trunk of the great sympathetic nerve, or nervus anas- tomoticus, between the second .sacral ganglion, No. 157, where it is simple, and the third sacral ganglion, which, in the first figure, could not be represented, but is well ex- pressed in the second figure, 33, where the trunk of the sympathetic nerve, l6A, is intercepted between 157, and 38. This anastomosing nerve is divided into two rami, inserted into the second sacral ganglion. l65. The internal, and The external. 167. Radix of the second sacral nerve, communicating with nerve, iSi, which almost represents the figure of the gang- lion. 168. ifiS. First radix of the third sacral nerve, communica- ting with nerve, 166. 170. Surculus of ganglion, 36, of the great sympathetic nerve, which 171. Runs with the very minute ramulus to the ligaments of the vertebra;. 172. 173. Ramuli of surculus, 170, dispersed in the muscu- lar, covering of the aorta. 174. to 177. Trunk of the visceral nerves. 178. 179. Origin, or radices of those nerves, from the tho- racic ganglion, 36, 180. Surculus, which the visceral nerve distributes to the muscular membrane of the aorta. 181. 182, Origin, or radices of the latter nerve, of which one, 181, arises from the trunk of the great sympathetic. The other, No. 182, fromganglion 3p.—After these radices have united into one trunk, they again divide into two, of which one 184. Is inserted into the visceral: 185. The other radi.x is inosculated into the third radix of that nerve. 186. 187. Third origin, or radix of the bicrural visceral nerve. They run into 188. One radix, which anastomosing with radix, 185, passes to the trunk of the visceral nerve. 189. 190. Two surculi. 191. to 194. Division of tlic trunk of the visceral nerve into 4 rami.—^That takes place when the latter nerve penetrates with its trunk through the hiatus, between the crura of the diaphragm, lit. h and i, into the cavity of the abdomen. After this division, a ramus becomes radix of the semilu- par ganglion, or plexys semilunaris, as we shall set in the fiollowing Plate.—In this figure, the elegatit distribution off the visceral nerve, on account of the diaphragm with the abdominal part, drawn towards the upper and left side, could not be described in its natural situation. 195. Surculus of ganglion 4^, passing to 196, 197. Ligaments of the vertebrae, and 198. To the intercostal artery. 199- 200. Surculi of the aortic ganglion, 48. 201. 202. Surculi of the aortic ganglion, 52, after having made frequent anastomoses with the aortic surculi, I99, 200, are ail 203. Collected into one nerve, which 204 to 211. Send surculi to the muscular coat of the aorta. 212. First radix of the second visceral nerve, or accessorius coming from the thoracic ganglion, 48. 213. Second radix of that nerve, arising from the thoi-acic ganglion, 52. 214. 215. Trunk of the accessorius, which passes through the hiatus, between the crura of the diaphragm, h and i, a little more externally and infcriorly than the larger visceral nerve, No. 174 to 177, migrates to the cavity of the ab- domen, and immediately divided into two rami, the supe- rior and inferior. 216. Superior, is joined with ramus, 194, of the larger vis- ceral. 217. Inferior migrates, not only to the semilunary ganglion of the great sympathetic nerve, but also is joined with sur- culus, coming from the second renal plc.xus, 253—as mayH be better seen from Plate XXX VTI. 218. 219. The superior aortic surculus, arising from ganglion, 52. 220, 221. The inferior aortic surculus, arising from the sam« ganglion, 52. 222. Ramulus, of the superior surculus to the aorta. 223, Conjunction of the superior surculus with the inferioi surculus. From this ramus arise 224 to 227. Ramuli, distributed on the aorta. 228. Ramus, joined with ramulus, 200. 229 to 231. Arc anastomosing branches with ramuli coming from 62. 232. Surculus of ramulus, 230, migrating to the aorta. 233. 233, Superior radix of the posterior superior rena nerve, taking its origin from ganglion, 52. 234. 234. Inferior radix of the superior posterior rena nerve. 235. 235. 235. Ramus, which the trunk of the great sym pathetic nerve, 62, sends to the muscular membrane of tin aorta. 236.

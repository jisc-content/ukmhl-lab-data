introduction. xiii These filaments, afterwards united in a common en- velope of cellular membrane, are called Nerves, and the branching of nerves is little more than the se- paration of a single filament, or fasciculus of fila- ments, from the common envelope in which they were included. Though we know various functions of the nerves, we know but little of the relations sub- sisting between their functions and structure. Much has been fancied, and much has been said, but little observed, and less demonstrated on this subject. The ramifications of all these systems differ in this from the ramifications of the vegetable kingdom, that in every place the smaller branches of the same species unite and separate, separate and unite again, so that veins with veins, arteries with arteries, â€™ and nerv es with nerves, are observed to form the ap- pearances of networks, that are called Plexuses. Upon the whole, their ramifications in the larger branches are also more regular than those of plants, and for this reason, that they are all distributed through a system of a definite form, and of definite functions; a system, too, composed of parts of definite forms, proportional magnitudes, and of determinate relative positions. In the vegetable kingdom there is not the same cause for regularity, where the several branches are distinct plants, not like the mutually dependent parts of the same system, but like indi- viduals living together in the same society, and de-

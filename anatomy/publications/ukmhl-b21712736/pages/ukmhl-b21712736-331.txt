A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. 273 ARTERIA PULMONALIS, The Arteria Venalis of Realdus Columbus, and the Vena Arteriosa of a great number of the older Anatomists prior to Harvey. It rises from the Right, or Pulmonic Ventricle, and ascends from its origin atlantad and sinislrad, until it arrives at the concave part of the Left Pillar of the Aorta, where it divides into two branches (w>), one on each side olâ€™ (a>) In the Foetus, it divides into three: the third branch en- tering the Aorta, and named the Ductus Arteriosus. From the collapsed state of the Lungs previous to birth, they cannot receive the whole of the blood that enters the Right, or Pul- monic Ventricle, and hence probably one of the reasons for the third branch during that period. If the Left, or Systemic Auricle of the Foetus were only to receive the portion of blood that flows through the Lungs, it would only receive a small quanti- ty, compared to what must necessarily flow in the same time into the Right, or Pulmonic Auricle ; and if the Left did not contract until it was filled, the Right, or Pulmonic Auricle and Ventricle would necessarily contract oftener than the Left. To prevent this effect, the Septum, interposed between the two Auricles, is imperfect in the Foetus, and the blood flows from the Right to the Left through a passage called the Foramen Ovale. By this contrivance, the Right Auricle cannot be distended soon-

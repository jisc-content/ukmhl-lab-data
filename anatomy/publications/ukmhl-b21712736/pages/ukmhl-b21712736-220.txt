A DESCRIPTION OP THE ARTERIES. ing Vertebra?, and a branch to the Involucrum of the Vertebral Tube (r). This last, on entering the Tube, divides into two subordinate branches : one running round by the Dorsal aspect, and another by the Sternal, to meet their fellows of the opposite side ; they also inosculate ailantud and sacrad with the neighbouring branches of the same side. From this Vertebro-Involucral branch, from the Dorsal branch, or from the Intercostal Artery itself, other two branches are sent through the Inter- vertebral spaces, one to be ramified on the Dura Mater (s), the other to be ramified on the Spinal Marrow (<), and to communicate with the Spinal canals. But these are small, compared to the branch which is seen ramified upon the Involucrum, and are not found so regularly present as to enter at each Inter-vertebral space (w). As the Intercostals proceed in their course to- wards the Sternal extremity of the Ribs, they send off branches atlhntad and sacrad to supply the bones, muscles, and Periosteum in their vicinity; branches to communicate with the neighbouring Intercostals; and many branches, which, passing peripheral like (r) Vertebro-Involucral br anch.

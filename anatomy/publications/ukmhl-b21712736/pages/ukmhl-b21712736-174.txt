116 A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES.

As I have now examined above twenty-six cases, snd have invariably found the vessels below the Fascia, I have less hesitation than I otherwise would have, in supposing that Mr. Bell’s description of this lusus is incorrect.”—Bums’ Varieties of the Larger Arteries. “ If it be remembered, that the Radial Artery-, when it comes off high, is uniformly covered as well as the Ulnar,” j. e. the

To have therefore a correct and enlarged idea of the vascular system, it ought to be known, that nu- merous millions of arterial branches, like those rami- fied on the Tunica conjunctiva, are only to be seen when they are inflamed, and conveying red globules; that millions of such arterial branches, instead of transmitting their fluids to the veins, terminate to- wards the surface of the skin, exhaling the vapour called perspirable matter; millions on the central as- pect of the bronchi, the pulmonic vesicles, and the tra- chea, exhaling the vapour that is seen in the breath; millions on the central aspect of the alimentary- canal, to lubricate the tube, to protect it against acrimonious matter, or to assist in the processes of digestion; millions on the central aspect of the shut cavities, to lubricate the membranes, facilitate mo- tions, and prevent adhesions; millions in the glands, to supply the fluids for glandular secretions; and millions in all the different organs for supplying fluids, to be assimilated in growth and nutrition. Now, the fluids which they send to the shut cavities, the fluids that remain after the supply of the glan- dular secretions, all the decayed parts of the organs, and the fluids sent, but not assimilated in giowth

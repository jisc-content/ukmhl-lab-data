a Description 6f the aiiteries. 138 Jfttmg with branches from the Musculo-Phrenk and those in the interstices, still more sacrad, with branches from the Phrenic Artery itself, or with Lateral branches from the Epigastric and the Ab- dominal (p). From the place where they reach the Sacral mar- gins, to some way beyond the middle of the Ribs, they run on the concave side of the margins perl pherad of the Pleura, and there assisted by the Vein and the Nerve, termed Intercostal, are observed to produce, m a number of the Ribs, a groove or de- pression. Beyond the termination of this groove where the Ribs are less extended in breadth, they are no longer observed on the central, but upon the sacral aspect of the margins; while several of them, particularly in the interstices of the true Ribs, send off a branch that runs obliquely sacrad and sternad, till it reach the Atlantal margin of the Rib that is situated sacrad, when it runs on the opposite side of the interstice, parallel to the Trunk that had given it origm. This branch, which is sometimes ca led the Inferior Intercostal, is, like the Trunk, often seen continued into some of the branches from the Sternal aspect (q). (l>) tee Hailer, Fascic.

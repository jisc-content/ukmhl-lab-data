A description of the arteries. Plants, with branches from the External Plantar ■ with Retrograde branches of the same Plantar pro! ceeding from its Arch ; and with the Tibialis An- tics, where it enters the Plants, and anastomoses with the Ramus Ex ter mis. Karnus Externus, or the Arteria Plantaris Ex. tenia, continuing the Trunk, runs dislad and fibulad, and centrad of the Flexor Brevis Digitorum, until • t reaches the Proximal extremity of the Metatarsal of the Little Toe; from that situation, or a little be- yond it, it bends centrad of the Flexor Tendons to the Tibial side, until it arrives at the Interstice be- tween the Metatarsals of the Great Toe and the In- dex Pedis. At that point, it meets and inosculates with the Tibialis Antica, and completes what is cal- led the Plantar Arch («). This is the only Arch of die Planta, and, though .seemingly (v) formed by (u) Verheyen, the first who observed and described the Deep Volar Arch, was the first also who bestowed the name of Arch on this part of the External Plantar. “ Hunc arcum “ primus dixit Philippus Verheyenius et inter ramum Plantaris " internum atqueTibialem Anticam, rete intercepi recte ob- " servavit.”—Haller, Fascic. V. p. 50. (v) It is a matter of little importance, whether this Arch be assigned principally to the Anterior Tibial Artery, or the Plan- tar branch of the Posterior. It is formed by both, and, like the Deep Volar in the hand, formed by the Radial and a commu- nicating branch from the Ulnar, may at times receive a greater

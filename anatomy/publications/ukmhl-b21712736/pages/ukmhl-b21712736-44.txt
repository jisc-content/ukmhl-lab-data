xvi INTRODUCTION. it be necessary for the student to remember thenv that which is totally impossible is necessary. For- tunately it is neither necessary nor proper, the very attempt feeing equally repugnant to the principles of reason and common sense. Let him only compare, with these plates and descriptions, a few preparations where the vessels have been successfully injected, or the branchings of nerves minutely dissected; he shall see his preparations in the smaller branches dif- fering widely, not onl} from the plates, but from one another; and shall see each preparation exhibiting branches and ramifications peculiar to itself, exhibit- ing many not referred to in the plates, and wanting many that are there honoured with obtrusive refer- ences and tedious descriptions. Such a comparison must soon convince him, that many branches and ra- mifications described by Anatomists, are the mere peculiarities of individuals, and yet these not a tenth, nor a twentieth part of what they might have talked of, had they descended to still smaller branches, nor one million of a thousand millions, had they taken the microscope, and tried to discover, enumer- ate, and describe the extreme branches that elude the sight of the naked eye. But if once assured of the general fact, that all individuals hitherto examined, (and many thousands have been examined,) presented varieties in their smaller branches; may we not now fairly conclude, b 2

J A DESCniPTION OF THE ARTERIES. to say. It IS not an accurate description of any ap- pearance that is common to the species; nor, indeed, a description applicable throughout to any appear- ance that occurs in individuals, but merely a de- scription of one of the occasional appearances of the " Humerale, qu’elle conserve jusqu’A sa division en Radiale et “ en Cubitale.'

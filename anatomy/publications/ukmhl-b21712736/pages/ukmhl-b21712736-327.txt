A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. 269 appearance of a lateral branch, than of what might he called a division of the Trunk; it is naturally wanting, when the Tibialis Postica is wanting; and even when the Tibialis is present, it has sometimes no other mark of distinction than that among the branches which issue from the Trunk, to be after- wards ramified on the Fibular side ; it is generally the largest, and has its origin in the Sinuosity of the Os Calcis. The External Plantar, on the con- trary, has been present when the Tibialis Postica has been absent; an event which also naturally occurs when the blood, diverted from its, usual channel in the region of the Leg, returns to it again by inoscu- lating branches in the region of the Foot. Taking the two as they generally appear, they rise together in the Sinuosity of the Os Calcis, near the broad ori- gin of the Abductor Pollicis Pedis, or the articula- tion of the Os Calcis with the Astragalus. The Ramus Interims, or the Arteria Plantaris Interna, as it sometimes is called, is seen running distad upon the Tibial side of the Planta, and the Central aspect of the Abductor Pollicis Pedis; dis- tributing branches to that muscle, to the Flexor Bre- vis, the Adductor Pollicis, and the parts adjacent, whether they be Bones, Ligaments, Tendons, or neighbouring Integuments. It inosculates upon the Tibial aspect with numerous branches from the Ilotular aspect; towards the Fibular side of the o 6

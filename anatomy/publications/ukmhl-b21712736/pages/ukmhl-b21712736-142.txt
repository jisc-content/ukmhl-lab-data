A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES, 84 SACHOTHYROIDEA (e), seu Thyroidea Inferior, Rises near the Sternal and Vertebral Arteries, and running ailantad by the Dorsal aspect of the Cephalic, and by the side of the (Esophagus and Trachea, terminates in the Thyroid Gland, and the Larynx. branches from the Sternal Artery. See Haller, Fascie. viii. Hole 8. To enumerate and describe them, may show industry, patience, minuteness, and accuracy, but not that kind of in- dustry, patience, minuteness, and accuracy, that are ever to improve Anatomy, Surgery, or Physiology. (e) A Sacrothyroid was seen rising from the arch of the Aorta, between the Arteria Anonyma and left Cephalic, by Neubauer, as quoted by Soemmerring, and once seen by Haller from the Cephalic. “ Semel,” he says, “ rarissimo exemplo, a “ Carotide vidi natam.” I have seen both Sacrothyroid* rising by a common trunk on the right side, and the left branch passing obliquely across the Trachea, where it would have been divided in tracheotomy. Haller mentions a case, where the Sacrothyroid was scarcely to be seen, (vix ulla esset) j Mr. Burns a case where it was wanting, and a case where it run on the Sternal aspect of the Cephalic.

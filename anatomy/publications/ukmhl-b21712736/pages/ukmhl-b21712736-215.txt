A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. 157 they reach the Sacral margins of the Ribs, a little beyond their articulations with the transverse Pro- cesses. Having reached these margins, they coast along them towards the Sternum, or Sternal aspect, where those in the interstices, situated atlantad of the sixth Rib, inosculate with branches from the Thoracics, and with Lateral branches from the Sternal Artery. Those in two or more of the interstices, situated sacrad of the sixth Rib, inoscu- “ suivantes, qui ont une direction horizontale.” He has seen them also running latorad and sacrad, to reach the interstices on which they were ramified. “ D’autres Art&res Intercostales “ Inferieures, ont quelquefois leur sortie de l’Aorte Superieure- “ ment aux espaces interoostaux dans lesquels elles se placent.” The most atlantal of these Intercostales has its origin generally about the fifth Vertebra, or opposite to the Cartilage between the third and fourth, and all the Intercostals, not excepting the first, which usually arises from the Subclavian, and de- scends to its interstices, have most commonly a retrograde course with respect to the Trunk from which they originate. That course is less retrograde the farther they are removed from the heart. At the last rib, they rise nearly at right angles; while the Lumbar Arteries, that follow in succession, begin to run laterad and saciad, and more and more sacrad in proportion to their distance from the left Ventricle. In short, these angles seem to be varied that the blood may flow nearly with the same force or momentum in all these Arteries; the angles, at which they severally originate, being less favourable to the momentum where the current is stronger in the Aorta, and more and more favourable as that current is weaker. An excellent representation of these several angles may be seen in the seventh Fasciculus of Haller, Tab. v.

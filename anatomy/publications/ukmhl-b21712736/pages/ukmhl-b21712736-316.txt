25S A DESCRIPTION of the arteries. aspect of the Carpus, and returns again to its former aspect between the Metacarpal bones of the Thumb and the Index Manus; so the Tibialis Antica of the Leg leaves the Popliteal for the Rotular aspect, runs along the bones of the Tarsus, and returns again to lts f°™er aspect between the Metatarsal of the Great Toe, and of what may be called the Index Pedis. As the Ulnar Artery always continues on the same aspect, and is very generally the principal Artery that furnishes the Volar and Digital branches, so the Tibialis Postica of the Leg always continues on the same aspect, and is in general the principal Ar- tery that furnishes the Plantar and Digital branches. This Tibialis frequently sends off a considerable branch that runs along the side of the Fibula as far as the Tarsus, and sometimes so large as to pass for the Trunk, when the Trunk is either said to be wanting, or only a branch of the Peroneal or Fibular Artery. The young Anatomist is here to recollect, that the Fibula is that bone-of the Leg which cor- responds to the Ulna of the fore-arm (p), and that fD The Radius, situated on the same side of the Hand with the Thumb, must correspond to the Bone of the Le- on the same aspect with the Great Toe. 'But besides this, there are many other proofs of analogy, of which I shall mention only one or two. < in viewing the extremities of the lower animals we soon perceive that the Radius and Tibia have a more regular and permanent character, than the Ulna and Fibula.

147 A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. The Bronchial Arteries are mentioned in a vague and general manner by Erasistratus and Galen. “ They are mentioned also,” says Haller, “ by “ Rhazes and Avicenna, and by other Anatomists, t( down to the time of Realdus Columbus, who,” he says, " was the first that denied their existence." The fact with respect to Columbus, is this: It oc- CI iliac modo deseriptae tam multis egregiis viris imposuisse, ut “ Arteriae Coronariae propagines, illas crediderint et inde liqui- “ duin illud ferrnentans secemi asseruerint.” Mr Abernethy of Bartholomew's Hospital, made a coarse injection whether, into the Veins or Arteries, pass through these Venulae Thebesii, which he denominates the Foramina Thebesii. In the healthy state, they are often so small as not to admit the coarse in- jection ; but greatly enlarged after pulmonary consumption, where there bad been a degree of obstruction to the circula- tion of blood in the Lungs. According to him, their enlarge- ment is calculated to prevent the distension of the Cardiac vessels \ and he supposes the Foramen Ovale to be frequently re-opened for a similar purpose. Upon examining the hearts of those who died of consumption, I have generally perceived a slight communication between the two Auricles, near the upper or atlantal margin of the Vestigium Forammis (Jvalis. Mr. Abemethy’s idea is new, that this is an effect, not a cause of consumption, and his idea is partly confirmed, at least corroborated, by what he observed respecting these Foramina Thebesii. Yet the two cases are not parallel throughout, the Foramina Thebesii, being only enlarged, while the pas- sage through the septum of the two Auricles is formed anew.— See Philosophical Transact.

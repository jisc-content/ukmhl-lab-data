A DESCRIPTION OP THE ARTERIES. 25 ARTERIA ORBITO-MAXILLARIS, (l/) seu Max ilia r is Interna. One of the brandies that terminates the Trunk of the Pericephalic, rises near the neck of the Con- dyloid process of the Basilar Maxilla, and from (y) As the Maxillary bones have never been distinguished by such epithets as external and internal, the terms external and internal Maxillary, could never have been meant to ex- press the Arteries particularly ramified on these bones. The tru'h is, the external Maxillary received its name merely from the circumstance of crossing superficially the Basilar Maxilla in its passage to the lips ; and this circumstance, not generally deemed a sufficient reason for imposing the name, some Anatomists have chosen to call it the Angular Artery, from its crossing near the Angle of the Jaw; others, the Facial, from its being ramified on a part of the face j while Haller, after assigning his reasons, has called it the Labial, and been followed by most Anatomists since his time. The tenn Sub- maxillary being also laid aside for the term Submental, the only Arteries now called Maxillary, is that Artery which, stretching from the neck of the Condyloid process of the Basi- lar Maxilla towards the Spheno-Maxillary fissure, is after- wards reflected forward through the Orbit, under the name of the lnfra-orbitary, and a branch of that Artery which, enter- D 4-

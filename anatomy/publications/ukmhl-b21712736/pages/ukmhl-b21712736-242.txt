A description of the arteries. 184 the concave nor convex side; but from that side whose aspect points sinistrad and dorsad. The branches to the Coion, measuring from the Trunk, arc generally among the largest and longest, and the rest, particularly from the middle of the curve, smaller and shorter to its termination. As they proceed to their destination, the contiguous branches inosculate laterally by others not inferior, or but little inferior to themselves in size. The inosculations form arches whose convexities are point- ed towards the intestines; from the convexities of t icse arches, other branches originate and inosculate by arches in a similar manner, till in some places, where the Mesentery is broad, there are seen no fewer than four or five series of arches; the arches be- coming smaller and smaller in proportion as the vessels decrease in diameter, and the largest branches at the commencement always forming the largest arches. On taking a side view of the whole, they suggest the idea of a piece of network, where the threads and the meshes gradually diminish in the same proportion. From the convexities of the last arches, small branches enter the concave side of the intestine, after previously dividing into two that are smaller. These last run on the opposite sides of the Tube, spread into ramuli that meet and inosculate at the convex side, having inosculated dur-

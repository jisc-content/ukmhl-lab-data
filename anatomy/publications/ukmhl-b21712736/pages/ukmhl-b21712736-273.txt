A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. M 3 521 iÂ» ARTERI.E H.EMORRHOlDiC. These are branches distributed to the Rectum, deriving a name from their situation, cither at or near to the place where blood is discharged from Haemorrhoidal tumours. A morbid appearance con- ferring here, like one near the Basilar aspect of the Tongue, an epithet of distinction on the neighbour- ing Arteries. They are very irregular in size, origin, number, and extent of ramification. They are seen springing from the Hypo-iliac, the Sacro-median, the Gluteal, Ischiadic, the Vesical, Vaginal, and Pudic branches. Anatomists arrange them into internal, middle, and external, not with a reference to what is central or peripheral in the Rectum, but with a re- ference to its two extremities, and the space interven- ing. In this sense, the most internal are those which arise from the Smaller Mesenteric, and the most ex- ternal those which arise from the Common Pudic. What Haller calls the Middle Haemorrhoidal, is a branch which he not unfrequently saw, running on that part of the Rectum where it meets the Vagina, or Urinary bladder ; a branch extending its ramifications to the Urinary bladder, the Prostate Gland, the Levator Ani, the Sphincter Ani, and the Urethra; not regular in its origin, nor always prc- ient.

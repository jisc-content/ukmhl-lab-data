A DESCRIPTION of the arteries. 234 the highest of the two Anterior Spinous Processes ; it passes through the Transversus Abdominis and between that and the Obliquus Internus, continues to follow the curvature of-the crest, until it arrive at its highest point, when it stretches more directly aU lantad, to inosculate with branches of the Sternal Artery, and with some branches from the last In- tercostals. The branches it gives off in the progress of its course, are small branches to the Inguinal Glands; some- times a branch, or sometimes branches, spreading to- wards the Symphysis Pubis, the Cremaster muscle, and Spermatic Cord. The branch to the Cord oc- casionally descending to the Tunica Vaginalis, and inosculating with branches from the Pudic and Sper- matic; blanches to the Psoas and Iliacus Internus, and a large branch winding round by the circum- ference of the Iliacus, till it meet and inosculate with a branch proceeding from the Ilio-lumbar; blanches ascending allantad and mesiacl, to meet with branches from the Epigastric; and other branches ascending atlantad and lalerud, to meet with branches from the Gluteal and the Lumbar Arteries. The proportions of magnitude between some of the larger branches of this Artery, are subject to varieties. Hence sometimes one, and sometimes another may apf ear to be the trunk. Among the

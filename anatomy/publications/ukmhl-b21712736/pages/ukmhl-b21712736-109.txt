A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. 51 E 5 Corpus Callosum, and the mesial aspect of its own hemisphere. Of the branches given out on the mesial aspect, some extend as far iniad as the Ten- torium, some run basilad to the Corpus Callosum, and some corouad, emerging from the Sulcus be- tween the hemispheres. In every place where they are to be seen, its branches are observed inosculating frequently among themselves, and where they are ramified on the same parts, inosculating likewise in a similar manner with branches proceeding from the Sylvian Arteries, or from the divisions of the Basilar Artery (r). It need scarcely be observed, that this place of the communicating or transverse branch. From this circumstance, Haller was probably led to view it as the com- municating branch merely. But, from that branch, it differs widely in many respects : it enters the Arteria Collosa at an acute angle, is nearly equal to it in size, contributes much to enlarge its diameter, and admits of no regular interchange of the circulating fluids between the right and the left side, as it regularly sends its blood to the left or common trunk, the only channel that now remains for the blood of the right Arteria Collosa to get to the mesial aspect of its hemisphere. I have only to add, that the word aliquoties, which is used by JIaller, seems to imply, that he had observed this appearance oftener than once; a circumstance which naturally suggests the question,—why does the right Arteria Callosa so often incline to unite with the left, and not the left be equally inclined to unite with the right ?

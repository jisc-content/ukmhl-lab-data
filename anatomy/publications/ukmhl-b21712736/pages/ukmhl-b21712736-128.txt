70 A DESCRIPTION Or THE ARTERIES. tion of Anatomists to these vessels, though from the manner in which he, and afterwards Vieus- senius, chose to represent them, Haller suspects, and with some reason, that their figures were not accurately copied from nature. Their appearances differ in different individuals. The two Sternal, near the Atlantal extremity of the Neck, are generally observed uniting into one, and continuing united through all the rest of the Ver- tebral Tube. The two Dorsal are generally ob- served to unite and separate, and to unite and separate again, and when they are separated, to ' communicate frequently by transverse branches. The Dorsal and Sternal, also, communicate by transverse branches, and sometimes the Dorsal meet with the Sternal, by wandering laferad in serpentine wind- ings. The Sternal, in places where they are separate, are generally observed to be larger than the Dorsal. The Dorsal terminate with the Spinal Marrow, about the second of the Lumbar Vertebrae; the Sternal united, are continued to the extremity of the Cauda % Equina. On the Cauda Equina, Vieussenius represents them as branching out in a manner similar to the Spinal Marrow ; but I rather suspect he has seen that appearance with such eyes as the Poet saw trees, churches, and strange visages in the “ red cinders.” There is no doubt, that every nerve of the Cauda

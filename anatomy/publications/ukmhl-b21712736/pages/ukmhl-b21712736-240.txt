182 A description of the arteries. Allowing the case to be extremely rare, it is na- tural to suppose, upon the general principles of analogy, that the two Arteries, from their close vici- nity, must often inosculate through the medium of t ien branches, and that occasionally branches from the one may supply the place of branches from the other. Besides the branches which this Artery does not unfrequently send to the Liver, and be- sides its branches that anastomose with CceJiac branches, near to the right extremity of the Pancreas^ I haVe seen a branclb as large as a crow quill, arising rom the root of the Gastric branch, and, after giv- ing out two or three Ramuli to the Pancreas, enter- ing at the root of the first branch that was sent f the Colon. The parts on which it is regularly distributed are the Pancreas, the Duodenum, the Jejunum, the eum, the Caput Caecum Coli, the Appendicula Ver- miformis, the right Colon, and the transverse Colon ; in short, the whole intestinal canal, excepting the left Colon and Rectum, the first of these receiving all its principal branches from the smaller Mesenteric‚Äù and the second from that and the Hypogastric. Ihe order in which these branches arise, is in some respects different from that in which the several portions of Intestine succeed one another. The first branches are sent to the Pancreas and Duodenum, where they communicate with branches from the

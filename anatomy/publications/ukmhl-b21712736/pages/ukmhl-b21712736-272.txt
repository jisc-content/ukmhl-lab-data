A description of the arteries. -although they arise from different Hypo-iliacs, are generally viewed and described together. In the adult, they are properly Vesical; but retain the title and rank of an office, which at one time they held in the Foetus. At that period, they were among the principal Arteries of the system, essential to its nourishment, its circulation, its existence. They appeared then to be continuations of the two large trunks, into which the Aorta divides in the Loins; they passed beyond the Fundus of the bladder to the Umbilicus, beyond the Umbilicus to the Placenta, and, without measuring their spiral windings around the large Vein of the Cord, were longer than the whole body itself. The Crural Arteries at that time, scarcely a fourth part of their size, appeared but as branches arising from their sides; while the Hypo-iliacs were blanches also, but inferior in size, arising from the convexities of their curve, where they turned by the side of the Urinary bladder at- lantad, and sternad to the Umbilicus. The bladder itself was different too in point of situation ; it was not then sunk into the Pelvis, as in the adult, and its Fundus reached to near the Umbilicus. In one of my Vascular preparations of the Foetus, which I ou^e to the kindness and politeness of a pupil, there is only one Umbilical Artery ascending on the Dorsal aspect of the bladder, and seemingly a con- tinuation of the Aorta.

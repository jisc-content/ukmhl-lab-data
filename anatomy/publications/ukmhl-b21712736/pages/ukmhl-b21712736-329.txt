A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. 271 the Tibial Artery that corresponds to the Ulnar of the Fore-arm, it is not superficial, but deeply seated, and in that respect rather resembles the Deep Volar Arch that is principally formed by the Radial Ar- tery ; and which, in cases uncommonly rare, sends off the Volar and Digital branches. During its course clistad and Jibulad, the External Plantar sends branches peripherad to the Incumbent Integuments and muscles : brandies towards the Fi- bular aspect, where they meet with others from the Rotular aspect; branches tibiad to inosculate with the Plantaris Externa, or if the Plantaris Externa be wanting, continued till they meet with other branches near the Tibial aspect. In its- course from the Fibular to the Tibial side, where it forms the Arch, it gives off the several Plan- tar branches that are either continued, or afterwards divided into Digital branches. The Digitals run dislad on the Tibial and Fibular aspects of the Toes, supply from the one than the other. “ Ut difficile dictu sit,” to use the language of the learned Haller, “ Ut difficile dictu “ sit an ad hanc omnino Plantarem Extemam arcus Plantaris “ pertineat, et tamen jura Antictz Tibialis potiora sint, qu* “ diametro Plantarem superet, et cujus truncus ita dirigitur, “ ut rami arcus Plantaris, angulos cum ipso obtusos, cum “ Plautari Externa acntos faciant atque adeo etiam hoc ex “ principio potius ad Tibialem Anticam spectent.”—Fascic.

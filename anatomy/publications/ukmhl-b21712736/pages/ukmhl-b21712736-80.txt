A DESCRIPTION OV THE ARTERIES. 22 Coronaries from the other are proportionally small. I have seen the appearance, but, like many of the tortuous windings of the Arteries, had been led to explain it from some difference in the force of the injection. ARTERIA OCCIPITALIS (tl) Rises behind tile Biventer Maxilla, and crossing the Internal Jugular slcrnad, follows a direction I,derad and dorsad-, till it reaches the space between the transverse process of the Atlas and the mastoid process of the Temporal Bone. From this station, having passed the Rectus Capitis Lateralis, it sinks under the Stemo-Mastoideus, and after running dorsad and mesiad, generally peripherad of the Corn- plexus, it emerges at last in the space between the Splenii, ascends the transverse ridge ol the Orapu , to which, for a while, it had run nearly parallel, and then divides into different branches that spread mesiad, cormad, and laterad, inosculating with their fellows of the opposite sides, and with branches from the Temporal and Auricular Arteries ; the principal parts oil which they are ramified being the integu- ments and Epicranius, Periosteum and bones, though w Seen .nee by Haller taking its origin fmaithe Elite- phalio, or lutcrual Carotid.

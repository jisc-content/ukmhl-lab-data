124 A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTEfilES of the Ulnar and Interosseal, and from the Ulnar itself (/), on the other. These recurrents are to he seen on all the four aspects of the arm, the Radial, the Ulnar, the Thenal, and Anconal, though, from the varieties in the division of the Humeral Artery, they are subject to changes in size, origin, distribu- tion, and number; unsteady as they happen to be in these respects. Anatomists generally de- scribe them with minuteness, on account of the con- fidence which they give to Surgeons in performing the operation for Aneurism near the bend of the arm. And yet Surgeons should know, as many of them do know, that the numerous small inosculating Ramuli, ape in every part ready to enlarge, to be! come conspicuous, and, if proper time be allowed for the change, to continue the circulation cf the blood, when the circulation in the Trunk of the Artery' or in its larger communicating branches, happens to be much impeded or obstructed. It implies, therefore, nearly as great an ignorance of the structure, to re- pose implicitly the whole of our confidence on these conspicuous inosculating branches, as it would to (/) If the Ulnar crosses the joint superficially, it has no recurrents running upon the Anconal aspect, nor are those on the Thenal very conspicuous, from its circulation, in that case, being less impeded by the motions of the Joint. Portal, speak- ing of its recurrents, observes therefore, “ Le nombre n’est ‘‘ pas bien fixe.”

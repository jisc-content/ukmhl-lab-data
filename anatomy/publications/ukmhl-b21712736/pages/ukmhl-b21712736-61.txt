3 A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. From the base of the Ventricle to the summit of the Arch, it is larger in diameter than at any other part of its course; this portion has been named the great Sinus of the Aorta. From the Arch issue the branches that supply the Heart, the Head, the Neck, the Atlantal extremities, and part of the Thorax. From the straight Thoracic portion, the branches that supply the remainder of the Thorax, and its Viscera ; and from the Abdomi- nal, the branches that supply the Abdomen and its Viscera, the Sexual organs, and the Sacral extre- mities. When it sends branches to parts that are situated in the Mesial Plane, or to parts whose attachments are in that Plane, or to parts that are single, the branches which it sends are usually single. But in all other cases, from the similarity of the two halves on each side of the Mesial Plane, it generally sends out branches in pairs, of which only one of the halves requires to be described. BRANCHES FROM THE ARCH. The Branches from the Arch are (cZ) the two Cardiac Arteries ; the common trunk of the Right (rf) The cases are rare where a Vertebral Artery, a Thyroid, a Thymic, a Pericardiac, or internal Mammary, arise from the Arch.

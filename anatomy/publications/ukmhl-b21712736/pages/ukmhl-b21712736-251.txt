A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. lgcf that side where the Tunica Albuginea is reflected from the Tunica Vaginalis (ar). When they do not originate from the Aorta, they rise from the Capsular or Renal branches ; from some'of the Lumbar; from the common Iliacs; from the Hypogastrics; or from the Epigastrics (y). The explanation of these origins is not difficult: From the original situation of the Testes in the neighbourhood of the Kidnies, they, agreeably to the principles of general analogy, receive branches from* adjacent Arteries, as the Aorta, the Renals, and (.r) The Tunica Albuginea is the Peritonial coat which the Testes had when lodged in the cavity of the Abdomen; the Tunica Vaginalis, the Peritonial Sac which the Testis carries down with it into the Scrotum. The Tunica Vaginalis is, there- fore, nothing more than the Hernial Sac of the Testis, and, if not closed, becomes a Hernial Sac of the Intestine, as iu Ht/rnia Congenita.

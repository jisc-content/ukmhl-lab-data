A DESCRIPTION OP THE ARTERIES. 115 few exceptions, between the Supinator Radii Longus, the Flexor Radialis, and resting on the Flexor Longus Pollicis. On reaching the Distal extremity of the Radius, it leaves the Thenal aspect of the arm ; runs anconad under the Abductor and Extensores an inch, says Mi'. Fyfe, below the elbow j it commonly divides into two principal branches, the Radial and Ulnar. It happens, however, now and then, that this division takes place directly over the joint of the elbow j at other times, about the middle of the arm, and not unfrequently as high as the Axilla.” When the humeral Artery divides high, Anatomists describe it as dividing into the Radial and Ulnar branches, although there be always one of the two, that is, strictly speaking, neither Radial nor Ulnar, but the common trunk of the Radial and Interosseal, or the common trunk of the Ulnar and Interosseal. If the Humeral Artery terminate regularly in the Radial and Ul- nar branches, it is impossible that one of these branches can rise before the other, and yet Anatomists speak as if sometimes the Radial, and sometimes the Ulnar rose highest in the region of the Humerus. When they use this language, they forget their own definition of the Arteries, and secretly view the common trunk as the Humeral Artery, while they call it by the name of the Radial or Ulnar. This inaccuracy of thought and con- ception, must necessarily lead to inconsistency and confusion of expression. “ In three subjects, who were females,” says my friend Mr. Bums, “ the Humeral Artery did not divide till it came near to the bend of the arm ; as soon as it had divided, the Ulnar Ar- tery, instead of passing beneath the Flexor Muscles of the Car- pus, perforated the Fascia, and attached itself to the Basilic Vein, along which it descended towards the wrist.” “We know

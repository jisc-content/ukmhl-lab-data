In this course, as it passes the Internal Jugular Vein, it sends along the coats of that vessel a branch that usually enters the Cranium, and inosculates afterwards with the Meningeals. The other branches which it gives out to the Biventer, the Stylohyoideus, the Auricle, the Glands, the Trachelomastoideus, the Sternomastoideus, the Complexus, the Splenius, the Trapezius, the In- teguments, the Obliquus Capitis Superior, the two Recti Capitis Postici, and the branches inosculating with the Vertebral Artery, are merely the branches which it naturally gives out to the parts adjacent, among which there is usually observed a Cervical branch, that is more or less extensively ramified on the dorsal and lateral parts of the neck, and observed to inosculate with branches proceeding indirectly or ultimately from the Brachial Artery.

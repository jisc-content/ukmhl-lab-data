a description of the arteries. ISO The Splenics send another branch to the Stomach, " *11C^ ls named the Gastro-epiploica Sinistra. This branch runs dexlrad, parallel to the two sides of the arch, and along the convexity, where the Gastrocolic- epiploon is attached. It is afterwards continued into the Gastro-epiploica Dcxtra, and sends off branches in a similar manner to the Stomach and Gastrocolic- epiploon. It rises sometimes from the Splenic Ar- tery, as that is coasting along the Pancreas ; some- times appears the division of the Cceliac, from which the Splenic branches originate ; sometimes again has its place supplied by two or more branches running along the Epiploon to the Stomach, and called the Gastro-epiploica; Sinistra? (o). As the distances and positions of the Spleen, must vary with the different states and positions of the Stomach, this Ai tery takes a flexuous course, and is made to be easily elongated or shortened, accord- ing to circumstances. Its flexures, observed pre- vious to injection, are always conspicuous when the (o) “ Gastro-epiploica Sinistra Ea Arteria, antrorsum “ emergit et deorsum, magnoque ambitu veutrioulum, a quo “ remota est, longis tribus quatuorve posteriori omenti faciei “ innatantibus flexuosis ramis adit, neque unum plerumque “trUDCUm habet> parallelum ventriculo, uti dextra solet “ Gastra-epiploica.

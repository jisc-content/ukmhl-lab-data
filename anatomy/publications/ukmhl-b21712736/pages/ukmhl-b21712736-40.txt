The ramifications of the nervous system are very different from the ramifications of any of the three vascular systems. Each half of both the Cerebrum and Cerebellum lias a stalk or pedunculus; these pedunculi are called Crura; these crura unite m the cranium, and form a ganglion called Tuber Annulare.. Between the ganglion and the large foramen, through which they pass from the cavity of the cranium, l ey areknownby the nameofMedullaOblongata,and upon entering the vertebral column, are distinguished by the name of Spinal Marrow.

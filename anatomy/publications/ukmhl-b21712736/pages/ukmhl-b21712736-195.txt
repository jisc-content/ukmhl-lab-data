137 A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. are sent branches to the Anconal aspect of the Thumb, and to the Anconal aspect of the interstice, between the Metacarpal bone of the Thumb and the fore-finger, while from the branch there is sent a supply to the Anconal aspect of the interstice, be- tween the Metacarpal bone of the fore and the middle finger. Besides these Anconal branches, however, the Radial Artery sends off more, and often a branch that runs ulnad across the Carpus, and which, meeting with a branch of the Ulnar Artery, forms an Ancuno-carpal Arch. This arch inosculates with several branches of Anconal Interosseals that descend to the Carpus; it inosculates sometimes with the perforating branches of the deep Volar arch that run proximad; it sends off, from its Distal aspect, branches that run along the Interossei, oc- cupying the three intermediate spaces between the Ossa Metacarpi of the fingers. These last branches, in their progress distcul, inosculate laterally with one another; inosculate, at the Proximal extremity of the Metacarpus, with the Volar perforants that of partial obstructions in the larger vessels, from which the branches derive their orgin. The observation which should have been extended, is in these words : “ Exigui errores non “ turbant hune primarium et pulcherritnum Ordinem, quo “ unique .'anguis, a dorso Manus ad Volam, a Vola ad dorsum “ Communicat, et omnis intercoptio in Commeatu Sanguinis “ cavetur.”—Fascic. vi. p. 46.

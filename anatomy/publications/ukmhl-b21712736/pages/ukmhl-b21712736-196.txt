138 A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. run proximad ; and, at the farther extremity of the Metacarpus, with the Digital branches, and the Volar perforants that run distad. If there be no Anconal arch, there is still, however, a Plexus of vessels formed by branches from the Radial, Ulnar, and Interosseal Arteries; branches, connected with this Plexus, that run along the Anconal aspect of the Interossei, and that, at the commencement of the Metacarpus, inosculate with the perforants that run proxijncid, and, at its termination, with the Digital Arteries, and the perforating branches that run distad. RAMIFICATIONS ON THE FINGERS AND THUMB. Each finger has two Digital Arteries on its Thenal aspect, a Digito-Radial on the Radial side, and a Digiio-Ulnur on the Ulnar side of its Flexor Ten- dons. Their origin, as has been already observed, is different often in different individuals, but their course and termination is generally steady. As they advance to the Distal Phalanx, they are seen inoscu- lating by transverse branches on the Volar aspect, and by smaller branches reflected round upon the Anconal. Having reached as far as the Distal Phalanx, and passed beyond the insertion of the Tendon, they are observed gradually converging, un-

I A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. ? 1 Equina is supplied with Arteries, but not with Ar- teries branching from the Spinal, and running longi- tudinally through their whole extent, till they issue from the tube of the Vertebral column. The an- terior Spinal extends to the Coccyx, and inosculating with branches that enter the tube through the In- tervertebral spaces in the Loins, and through the Foramina of the Os Sacrum, forms a plexus that afterwards supplies the nerves of the Cauda. Both the Sternal and Dorsal canals, are usually described as commencing within the cavity of the Cranium, and as springing from either the branches or trunks of the Vertebral Arteries, and chiefly, for the reason, that the tributary branches in that situa- tion enter the canals at their extremities, of which branches, the canals are afterwards supposed to be only the continuations. Thus, from the Vertebral Arteries, or the Basilar, a branch or branches (£), two or more uniting, enter the extremities of the Sternal canals; while, from the Inferior of the Cerebellum, a branch or branches (/), two or more W “ Cette Artfere (l’Art&re Spinale Anterieure) est quel- “ quefois, comme on vient de la dire, formee par la reunion des “ Arterioles fournies par une Vertebrale.” (/) “ Cette Artere (I’ArtiSre Spinale Posterieure) provient “ des Rameaus que l’Artere Vertebrale. fournit a la partie posterieure de la moelle aliongce, et a la partie posterieure F 3 X

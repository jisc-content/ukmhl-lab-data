An envy which, though compelled to be silent, has yet left behind it so discolouring a stain, that the merit of Harvey, to its full extent, is seen but obscurely in the present day, and by some Anatomists, as the late Dr. Hunter, scarcely seen at all. It should therefore be known, that the merit of Harvey did not consist in stumbling accidentally on any new facts, that necessarily forced him to see the circula- tion. In making his discovery, he was placed exactly in the >ame s.tuation with hundreds before, and hundreds in his tune: the facts, on which he established his conclusion, were facts generally known and admitted; facts that were seen, and facts that were examined by a great many others, some a century, and some even twenty centuries before. The valvuke tr.cusp.des and valvute mitrales, placed at the orifices of the two ventricles, and the valvul* semilunares, or sigmoides, a,

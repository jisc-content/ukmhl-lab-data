14 A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIE5. circular plexus. From the concave part of thw plexus^ converging branches with small vascular areolae between them, radiate towards the margin of the Pupil, and inosculating laterally form the interior ring of the Iris, which is seldom perfect, or rather perhaps, is very seldom completely injected. Of the branches penetrating the Optic nerve, and afterwards running along its axis, one, considerably larger than the rest, is distinguished by the name of Centralis Retinae. It is seen ramified upon the con- cave aspect of the Retina, and by lateral communi- cations, two of its branches were seen by Zinn, in the eye of a Sheep, dividing laterally, like the long Ciliaries, and forming a ring (Â») on that margin of the Retina, where it seems to terminate at the com- mencement of the Ciliary Plicae. A branch also from this Artery, has occasionally been seen passing through the centre of the Vitreous Humour, to the capsule of the Lens, and, though much seldomer, a branch also passing through the centre of the Lens (o) itself. (re) This ring I likewise have seen, and oftener than once m the eye of a Sheep. (o) I must confess, though 1 never have seen the one or the other of these branches, I feel no inclination to doubt the veracity or accuracy of those who have mentioned them. Sabatier, however, who has seen the branch that penetrates the

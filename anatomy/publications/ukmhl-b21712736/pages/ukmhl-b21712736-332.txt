274 A description of the arteries. the Aorta, the Right to be ramified on the Right Lobes, and the Left on the Left Lobes of the Lungs. This Artery, like the Aorta, is at its commence- ment furnished with three Semilunar Valves, to pre- vent the return of blood to the Ventricle. As the whole of the blood, which circulates through the Left, or Systemic Ventricle and the Aorta, circulates likewise through the Right Ventricle and Pulmonic er than the Left; whence they must contract at the same time, and if the two be of equal capacities, must convey equal quan- tities of blood to their respective Ventricles. The two Ventri- cles, contracting together after the Auricles, must also, if they be of equal capacities, convey equal quatities of blood in the same time to their respective Arteries. Or supposing neither the Auricle* nor Ventricles of the same capacities, but their actions synchronous, the Auricle with Auricle, and the Ven- tricle with Ventricle, contracting together, as we know is the case, in the healthy and regular motions of the system ; the Pulmonic Ventricle would then discharge a greater quantity of blood into the Lungs, than the Systemic, or Left Ventricle, in the same time could discharge into the system at large, or discharge a less quantity of blood into the Lungs, than would be sufficient to-support the action of the Systemic Ventricle and Artery; in either case, the blood would accumulate in the Veins, the Auricle, the Ventricle, or in the Artery that returns it to the Lungs,â€”an event which not unfrequently happens in the last moments previous to death, when the wonted force of the Heart is diminished, and the wonted resistance of the Lungs is increased from the languid and imperfect state of respiration.

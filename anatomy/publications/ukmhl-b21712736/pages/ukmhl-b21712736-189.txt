A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. 151 last, a branch which, running obliquely across the Metacarpal bone of the Index, divides afterwards into the Digito-Ulnar of the fore-finger, and the Digito-Radial of the middle finger; or sometimes into the two Digitals of the fore-finger, and the Digito-Radial of the middle finger ; or, lastly, after forming its arch, and anastomosing with the Ulnar Arteiy, by sending off, in farther addition to these branches, the Digito-Ulnar of the little finger, and a Volar branch that afterwards divides into the Digito-Radial of the little finger, and the Digito- Ulnar of the ring finger (r). As for the branch that is usually considered as ter- minating the Trunk of the Radial Artery, and which running ulnad across the Metacarpus, forms what is called the Deep Volar Arch, it is of different re- lative magnitudes in different individuals, in propor- tion to the number of Digital branches that are pre- viously sent off. As it generally inosculates directly or indirectly with a branch or branches from the Ulnar Artery, it is found to be larger where tlie Ulnar branch meets it directly, and contributes to the formation of the arch, than where the communi- cating branch from the Ulnar inosculates only with (r) This last distribution I have not seen, but I give it authenticated by the indubitable authority of Haller.â€”See Faicic. iii. p. 43. and Fascic. vi.

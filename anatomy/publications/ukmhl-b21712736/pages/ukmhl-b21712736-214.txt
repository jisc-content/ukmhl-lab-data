156 A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. They rise from the Dorso-lateral aspects of the Aorta; those which are ramified towards the right passing across the Mesial Plane, and running dorsad. of the Vena Azygos. From the place of their origin, they run in a direction luterad and allantad (o), till “ tronc, nous avont dit qu’elle produisoit quclquefois de cettu " maniere les Intercostales Superieures qui naissent com- “ munement des sous-clavieres. On observe assez souvent, “que les Intercostales des deux C6t6s naissent d’un seul 1 rone, “qui vient de la partie posterieure de l’Aorte.” Can it be possible that this is the passage to which Sabatier alludes, when he says, “ M Lieutaud rapporte une variele plus ex- “ traordinaire : 11 a vu touteB les Intercostales Inferieure* “ venir de deux troncs qui tiroient leur origine de l’Aorte; il y “ en avoit un a droite et un second a gauche.” Or is it not equally singular that Portal should consider this variety, which is mentioned by Lieutaud, as the common mode in which the Aortic Intercostals originate ? “ Ces Artbres (les “ Intercostales Inferieures) sortent de la partie laterale et “ Posterieure de l’Aorte, par paires reunies en un seul tronc “ tres court.” (o) Portal had seen Intercostals running obliquely laterad and atlantad over two or three ribs, to the Costal interstices on which they were ramified. If he meant to say that he has seen them running on the vertebra;, and passing two or three of the interstices, he has seen nothing new, but if he has sten them crossing the rib's, as they appear in Haller’s Fig. Fascic. vii. Tab. v. where the Aorta is quite removed from its natural situation, he has seen something that is rather uncommon. His language is, “ Souvent mcrae, dies passeut sur un de ces inter- “ stiees sans y fournir des rameaux, et remontent au-dessus de <( deux et trois Cotes; les premieres, plus haut que les

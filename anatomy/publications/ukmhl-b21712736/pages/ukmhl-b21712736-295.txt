A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. 237 N 2 Pelvien Pudic, and from the Iliac Portion of the Crural Artery. Nine times Haller observed it arising by a trunk common to it and the Epigastric; while others have remarked, that the common trunk being some- times longer and sometimes shorter, makes it to as- sume different situations, with respect to the sac in Crural Hernia. Mr. Bums saw it twice deriving its origin from the Superficial Femoral, and ascending to the Pelvis under the Arch, and along the Mesial aspect of the Vein. Haller saw it composed of a branch from the Hypo-iliac, and of another from the Epigastric, and expresses his surprise that the like \ had been noticed by Jacobus Sylvius, at a time when minute Anatomical Description was not very com- mon. Portal has observed these two branches unit- ing into one before they left the Pelvis, and has seen them inosculating only by their branches after they left it (b). In Crural Hernia, the Obturatoria from the Epi- gastric has been seen running round the neck of the sac on the Sternal aspect. Dr. Monro, when he late- ly published on Morbid Anatomy, imagined this cir- cumstance had first been noticed by Mr. James Wardrop. In Britain, I believe it was first noticed in that preparation of which Dr. Saunders has in his Thesis, and Mr. Cooper, in the second part of his (4) See his description of the Epigastric.

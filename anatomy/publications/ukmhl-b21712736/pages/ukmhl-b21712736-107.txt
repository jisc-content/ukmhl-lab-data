49 A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. Commissure, a part of the Fornix, and the Septum Lucidum. By the general connection which this chain establishes between the four principal Arteries that enter the Cranium, the steady uniformity of the circulation throughout the Cerebrum, the Cerebel- lum and Medulla Oblongata, must be less dependent upon the extreme communicating branches, and whatever be the motions or positions of the head, sternad, dorsad, dextrad, or sinistrad, there are none « that can retard the free circulation in some of these vessels, that will not proportionally favour it in others. Arteria Sylviana Runs at first directly laterad, or nearly so, and, be* fore it enters the Fossa Sylvii, sends branches to the Optic nerves, the Plexus Choroides, sometimes even to the Pineal Gland, and such a number of small branches to the Crus of the Cerebrum, that Wepfer considers them as a Rete Mirabile. Proceeding in its course to the lateral aspect, it sends branches glabellad and iniad to the base of the two contiguous Lobes, di- vided by the Fossa. At the lateral aspect, it spreads coronad, iniad, glabellad, inosculating with branches from the Basilar Artery, and the Callosa. Its nu- merous branches also inosculate among themselves, » E 4

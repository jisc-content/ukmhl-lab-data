The account, however, which Haller has given in his seventh Fasciculus, and where he distinguishes the three sets of Arteries, is the most correct. INTERCOSTA LIS PRIM A, seu Intcrcosialis Superior, Crosses the central and concave aspect of the first rib, near its Vertebral extremity; and periplierad of the Pleura, is seen ramified on the first Costal interstice, generally on the second, sometimes on the third, rarely on the fourth. Throughout its course, it uniformly rests either on the ribs, or Intercostal muscles. Had it arisen from the arch of the Aorta, it must necessarily have stretched through a considerable intermediate space, without any support, excepting from loose cellular membrane, and as the parts between which it extended might of- ten have varied their relative position, in consequence of the different states of respiration, its functions had been more exposed to interruption, than in a situa- tion where the parts of the course, over which it

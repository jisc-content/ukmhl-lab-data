A DESCRIPTION OF T1IE ARTERIES. 97 convey very different meanings (q). As for Haller’s Figure of this Artery, and its ramifications, after what he has said concerning the principles on which he proceeded, it cannot be thought disrespectful or injurious to his high and justly acquired reputation. (y) Portal is very confused and inconsistent in b s descrip- tion of this Artery, which he terms the Brachial. At one time, he makes it to terminate at the bend of the arm, at another, in what he calls the Radial and Ulnar branches; and again, when speaking of the high division, he considers these branches as two Brachials. “ Cette Artfere, (l’Artore Braehiale) qui est la continuation “de l’Axilaire, est uu peu moms grosse qu’elle; elle porte ce “ nom jusqircs vers le pli du coude, uu elle se divise en deux “ Artores, qui vont a l’avant bras “ Le longueur de I’Artfcre Braehiale n’est pas toujour? la “ mSme, se divisaut tantdt plus haut, taiitot plus has. “ J’a vu cette Art ere se diviser elle-meme en deux troncs, “ et former deux Arthes Brackiules, et alors chacune d’eiles “ alioit, en se prolongeant, former la Cubitale et la Radia/e Sabatier is equally inconsistent as Portal; for, although he describes the Humeral Artery as terminating regularly, and losing its name in the Radial and Ulnar, yet he afterwards speaks, as if these Arteries were not entitled to assume the name, till they reached the fore-arm, that when they divide in the region of the Hqnjerui, they form a double Humeral Ar- tery, and, by parity of reasoning, would form, also, a double Axillary, and a double Subclavian, were they to separate in the region of the Neck. “ Lorsque l’Artere Axillaire a donne naissanee aux deux “ Circonflexes, elle change de nom, et prend celui d’Artfere G 4

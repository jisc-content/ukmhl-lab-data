A description of the arteries. it by a common trunk (g). Immediately almost after its origin, it divides into branches, though in no regular or determinate manner. It occasionally sends off Capsular branches, and more frequently than the Aorta, the Phrenic branches that are rami- fied on the concave side of the Diaphragm. The organs which in general are wholly supplied from this source, are the Stomach, the Liver, (/*) the Spleen, and Epiploon, named Gastro Hepatic; those that derive from it only a partial, though regular supply, are the Duodenum, the Pancreas, and Epiploon, termed Gastro-colic. The principal branches arc the Gastric, Hepatic, and Splenic; the Hepatic and Splenic, in every instance that has yet been ob- served, conveying a portion of their blood to the Stomach. (g) Several Anatomists, mistaking the ambiguous language of Galen, had described these Arteries as rising regularly by a common trunk. Haller, believing in 1745 that this never hap- pened, observes, when treating of the Mesenteric in his third Fasciculus, p. 44. “ Unica est perpetuo et sque diversa a “ Cceliaca.” But, in 1756, in his eight Fasciculus, Note 11. recommends the following addition to be made: « Semel ta- “ men A. 1751. communi trunco natam vidi.” {h) Haller mentions one case in which the Superior Me- senteric furnished the whole of the Hepatic branches. “ Ut " omnino nihil Hepati Cceliaca daret.but, so far as I know, this is the only instance on record.

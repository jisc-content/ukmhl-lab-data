A DESCRIPTION OP THE ARTERIES. 152 From the time that Ruysch saw this Bron- chial vessel, he supposed it was intended for nou- rishing the Lungs, the Bronchial Tubes, and the Bronchial Glands; the Pulmonic Artery, in his opinion now, being chiefly destined to transmit blood for the sake of undergoing a change by re- spiration (k). Advancing this opinion, he does not appear to have recollected that the blood, while flowing in the last branches of the Pulmonic Ar- tery, and before it enters the Systemic Veins, must G) “ Hanc Arteriam Bronchialem maximi faciendam esse “ existimo, non quidem ratione quantitatis, sed qualitatis “ sanguinis. Sanguinem enim sinistrum Cordis Thalamum “ transgressum, nobiliorem esse, dextri Ventriculi sanguine, “ quis negaturus ? Existimo itaque, ut finem imponam, hanc “ Artcriam esse conditam, ut Pulmonibus sanguinem nobi- “ liorem, perfectiorem, imo magis exaltatum, communicaret” —Ruyschii Opera, ibid. In 1659, about thirty years from the time that he first saw the Bronchial Artery, Ruysch mentions, in a letter to Graetz, that he had observed considerable variety with respect to its origin; that he had seen it not only arising from the A rta, but Superior Intercostal and the third Inter- costal ; and that he had filled its ramifications by injecting wax from the Pulmonic Artery, though he never had attempted to inject the Pulmonic Arteries from the Bronchial. « Repleta “ Arteria Pu,raonali Ceracea Materia, illico quoque repleti “ conspiciuntur ramuli Arteries Bronchialis ; nullusque dubito, “ quin 1,oc vice versa q«oq«e fiat, quamvis id nunqnam “ tentarim."—Ruyschii Opera, sol. 2.

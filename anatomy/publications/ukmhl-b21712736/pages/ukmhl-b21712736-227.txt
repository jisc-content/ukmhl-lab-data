A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. l6Â») Any naturalist would be deemed inexcusable, if pretending to describe the species dog, lion, or horse, he merely described a particular animal belonging to these species. This, however, is but too frequently the practice with Anatomists, who in describing a nerve or a blood vessel, usually describe some common variety as forming its ge- neral outline or character, and then enumerate the other varieties, which they happen to observe, as particular exceptions; though these varieties be no more exceptions from the one described, than the one described is an exception from them. Many Anatomists, perceiving that the previous descriptions of authors were not applicable to those varieties of the Cceliac Artery which they had ob- served, have invented names to suit the varieties which they had seen ; so that names, for the varying branches of the Cadiac, have been multiplied to the utmost degree of confusion. Nor has Haller in the least diminished this confusion, by collecting these names, and attempting to show that they all are synonynjes of one or other of the varieties which he has described. He seldom divests himself of the notion that he is describing regular Arteries, or refrains from the habit of enumerating particulars, instead of generalizing his ideas. Although he knew, he does not seem to reason as if he knew, that, in addition to the general latitude of ramification en- K 4f

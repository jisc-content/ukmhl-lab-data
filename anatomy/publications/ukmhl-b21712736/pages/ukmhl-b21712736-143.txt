85 A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. In its course, it sends branches to the Trachea, to the (Esophagus, and to the neighbouring constrictors of the Pharynx. The branches which it sends to the Trachea, sometimes extend in a sacral direction to the Bronchial Glands; the branches ramified on the Thyroid Gland (f) inosculate with the branches of the Atlantothyroid of the same side, and with their fellows of the opposite side. The branches to the Larynx, are expended chiefly on the Thyro-ary- tenoideus, and the Crico-arytenoideus Posticus. The other Arteries directly or indirectly from the Subclavian Portion of the Brachial./ These Arteries admit of no definite description as to their size, origin, or number, their course, or (/) Though the right and the left lobes of what is usually called the Thyroid Gland, be, in general, united on the Sternal aspect of the Trachea, yet there are cases, and these not a few, where no such union is to be observed, and where the right and the left lobes, are as evidently distinct Glands, as the two Parotids, or the two Kidnies, which two last are sometimes united on the Sternal aspect of the Lumbar Vertebra:, exhibit- ing a figure, though not strictly like, yet somewhat similar, on a slight inspection, to that presented by a horseâ€™ shoe. (g) The course of an Artery to any given part, must always, in some measure, depend on the situation or position of the place from which it originates. / civ Citric* ~ v', Lf C-yTVxt-uf,

A description OF the arteries. 12$ In one class, the Ulnar Artery, pacing the side of the Pisiform bone, turns radiad under the Apo- neurosis Palmaris, and forms a curve that is convex dM; from the convexity of this curve, a number oi \ olar branches proceed, which Volar branches, i unning as far as the Distal extremity of the Meta- carpus, are seen continued, or are seen dividing into Digital branches, supplying the Thumb and the dif- ferent fingers. Of these Volar branches, it may also be ob- served, once and for all, that whenever they run towards an interstice, between two fingers, they generally divide into two branches, a Digito-Radial ninmng on the finger that is situated ulnad, and a Digito-Ulnar running on the finger that is situated radiad. In a second class, a Thenal branch (o) from the ad.al Artery, running most commonly above the Transverse Ligament of the Carpus, though some- times undei it, meets and inosculates with the Uinar C°) This is the superficial Volar branch of the Radial Artery underthe L imP1'°Perly °alled S0> " * n,DS —ionally’ under th Ligament.

9 A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. Portal, and several other Anatomists, are inclined to view it as the commencement of the right Brachial, and the more so, that it bends towards the Axilla, mentioned, but not repeatedly observed. See Portal, Tableau Cbronologique et Journal des Savans, 1668. Even the case mentioned by Walter, where the right Brachial, and the two Cephalies, arose together by a common trunk, although often seen in comparative Anatomy, (Cuvier, xxv Leyon, Art 1.) is rarely observed in the human species, although from the close contiguity of the trunks in some cases, very easily fancied. The case quoted by Soemmerriug from Malacarne, where two Aortas arose from the Ventricle, and which were united after each had given out the Encephalic,- the Pericephalic, and the Brachial Arteries of its own side, and the case quoted by Haller from Hommelius, where the Arch divided into two branches that afterwards united, and which left between them an an- nular-like space, for the passage of the Trachea and (Eso- phagus, the Sternal branch sending off the left Cephalic, and left Brachial, and the Dorsal branch, the corresponding Ar- teries of the opposite side, might rather be termed unnatural appearances, than exceptions from the usual ramifications. The case, however, mentioned by Hunauld, has a fairer title to the name of an exception. Where the first branch arising from the Arch was the common trunk of the two Cephalies, then the left Brachial, and then the right, the last trunk being afterwards retlected to its own side, like that mentioned by Dr. Monro, jun. which returning dextrad between the (Esophagus and Trachea might have been, he thinks, the cause of Dyspha- gia. With a similar origin the Right Brachial sometimes returns between the (Esophagus and Vertebral Column. See Soem. Haller, remarking that all such cases are extremely rare, expresses a hope, that, after dissecting forty bodies, he nr

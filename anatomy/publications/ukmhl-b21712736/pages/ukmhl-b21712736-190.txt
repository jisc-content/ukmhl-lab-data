132 A DESCRIPTION OK the arteries. some of its brandies, or inosculates with other branches of the Radial, before the arch has begun to be formed (,). According to Haller, Verheyen was the first who described this branch, and the first who favoured the Public with a figure of it. Since that period, all Anatomists who have written on the Arteries, have, so far as I know, regularly mentioned it, though many with such uniformity m description, that one would be almost tempted to e ieve, that they had described it with little varia- tion from the same individual, or the same figure. illustrious Haller, who was well acquainted with several varieties which it not unfrequently exhibits in the species, has, after mentioning a number of those that were seen by others, given a detail of all UlL} 7 ,S °ften seen inosculating with the n r Artery, by its Thenal branch that joins the superficial o ar arch; iS often seen inosculating with the Ulnar Arterv through the Digital branches that run to the Thumb, and the fore-finger, or through the medium of that stem from which these branches derive their origin ■, it is also seen inosculating t7T y-T th: U1Uar ^ near to the Ulnar aspect of he Vola, either directly through the medium of its arch, or uough the branches proceeding from its arch. The Ulnar rtery, ,n these cases, also inoseulates through the medium ranches. These inosculations are independent of those numerous small inosculations, which are less obvious to the na ed eye, and which generally admit of a much wider range of variety, than those which are more conspicuous and large.

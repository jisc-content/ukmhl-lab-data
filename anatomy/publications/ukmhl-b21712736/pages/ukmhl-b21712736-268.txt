Sio a description of tiie arteries. It sends branches to the Pyriformis, the Gluteus Medn,s the t*o Sacro-ishiadic ligaments, the Coccy- geus, the Levator Ani, the Gluteus Magnus, the Sacium and Coccyx; the small branches to the Sacrum and Coccyx, communicating with branches from the Sacro-laterals on the dorsal aspect, and oc- casionally penetrating through the Foramina, or by the stdes of the Sacrum and Coccyx into the Pelvis here is no Artery, not excepting the Pudic, which is often its branch, and which takes for a while a similar course that so conveniently supplies the Gemelh, the Quadratus Femoris, or the Ischiadic nerve, while that remains in the neighbourhood of the Pelvis. A branch accompanying this nerve a part o its way, and others accompanying the-Gluteus Magnus to its insertion, have been seen inosculating with some of the branches of the highest Perforant and with branches from the Internal Circumflex in the region of the Femur. 1 he branches ramified round the Tuberosity of the Os Ischium, naturally inosculate with branches lorn the Pudic, and distribute ramuli to the Ten- dinous origins of the Semitendinosus, the Semimem- branosus, and to the long head of the Biceps ; while the branches towards the Articular Capsule, Ob- turator Externus, and the Acetabulum, as naturally inosculate with branches from the Internal Circum- flex and Obturatoria.

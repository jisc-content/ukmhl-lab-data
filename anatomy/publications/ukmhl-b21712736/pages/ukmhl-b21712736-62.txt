4 A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. Cephalic, and the Right Brachial (e), usually called Arteria Anonyma, or Innominata ; the Left Cephalic, and the Left Brachial (/). (e) The terms Cardiac and Cephalic are borrowed from Chaussier, and applied to the Arteries in allusion to the parts on which they are ramified: Cardiac expressing what belongs to the heart, and Cephalic what belongs to the head ; Carotis Communis, the usual name for the Cephalic, being in al- lusion to a false hypothesis, suggests no idea of either its course or its destination. The term Brachial naturally expresses what belongs to the Brachium, a word that denotes the Atlantal extremity, from the top of the Shoulder to the points of the Fingers. This term has sometimes been used to signify, merely, that portion of the Artery which lies on the Humerus, as the two terms. Sub- clavian and Axillary, signify the portions under the Clavicle and in the Axilla. But as it is proper that the whole should have a name, as well as the parts, I have chosen Brachial as a general epithet expressive of the organ through which it principally distributes its branches. (/) Cuvier, in speaking of the Mammalia, (xxv Leyon, B.) says you may find in the different animals of that class, examples nearly of all the kinds of ramification that Anatomists hitherto have found in Man. In some, the branches arising from the Arch, are similar to those of the human species. In others, the Aorta, immediately after leaving the Ventricle, divides into two, an ascending and descending Aorta, where the first afterwards separates into halves, that each half may send off the Bra- chial and Cephalic Arteries of its own side. In others, the c 6

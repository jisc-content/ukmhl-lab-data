«23 A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. been able to provide a remedy against the obstruc- tions of the larger Arteries, it seems to have done it by previously and gradually enlarging the vessels that were in future to perform the functions. This is not exactly the method that is followed when we hastily proceed to tie an Artery, without a previous attention to the channels in which its blood is after- wards to flow. A limb may be lost, and I venture to say many have been lost, where the accommodating power of the system, from want of ability, or from want of time, could not possibly provide against the effects of sudden obstruction. An imitation of the natural process, by previously compressing the trunk of the Artery, and gradually enlarging the lateral vessels, before the operation of tying the ligature, has frequently been attended with obvious advantage. As to the circumstances which ought to regulate the extent and continuance of this compression ; where it is practicable and where not; when and where it would be injurious; and when alone it would be capable of performing a cure with- out the necessity of an operation, the reader will receive much information from Scarpa’s valuable treatise on Aneurisms, and from the notes of his in- genious and accurate translator Mr. Wishart. We know not yet the causes that produce, and the causes that prevent the total obliteration of the Ar- tery, and its several branches between the ligature

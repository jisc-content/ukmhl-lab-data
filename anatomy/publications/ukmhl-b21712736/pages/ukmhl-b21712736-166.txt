It is not only irregular in its origin, and mode of origin, but in its size, and in the number of its rami- fications. Its permanent characters are to be found principally in its course. It enters generally, if not always, between the second and third head of the Triceps (x); winds round in a spiral manner, ac- companying, for a while, the Radial nerve, and at last, terminates in small branches, near the Radial condyle, where it communicates Svith Radial recur- rents. In the progress of its course, it is seen com- municating with branches from the Humeral Artery ; near its commencement with branches from the Axillary, and, not unfrequently, with Ulnar recur- rents, by means of a branch, or sometimes branches, that it sends off before it turns round the Anconal aspect. (.r) Haller in speaking of its course, says, “ Provenit ad " imam oram Tcretis Majoris cum Latissimo conjnncti et “ continuo-se int°r brevem longumque extensorem abs.ondit.” But this language is not to he understood, as if it passed to the Radial side, between the first and second head of the Triceps; the figures to which he refers show the contrary; and he afterwards adds, “ Inter Brachialem externum et brevem Circumflectitur, circa Os Humeri, comes Nervi Radialis.”

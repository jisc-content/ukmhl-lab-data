Some of the Ramuli of the short Ciliary, extend as far as the Ciliary processes, and it would appear from mercurial injections, that they are employed "t® suPP!y Part of the aqueous humour. The Iona- Ciliary, when they approach the circumference of the Ins, inosculate laterally through the medium of their branches, and form a ring, and the anterior by in- osculating similarly form another immediately within ■t, though these rings be not easily distinguished, • as both, m general, seem to unite in forming one l-l not seen, he was hardly correct in questioning without Mining a reason, the judgment and veracity of respectable observers, who said they had seen them.

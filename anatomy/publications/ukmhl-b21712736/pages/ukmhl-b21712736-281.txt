223 A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. the living body. Were these Arteries only to en- large, and to open new channels for the blood that flowed in the trunks, as they had frequently been found to do, where trunks have been obliterated, con- tracted, or obstructed, why might not an Artery be tied in Aneurism, without hesitation and without ap- prehension ? That the lateral vessels, in such cases, have often been enlarged, and been found adequate in performing the duty of the larger vessels, cannot be denied. But an object of some importance to Surgery, and the reader will here pardon the digression, would be, to ascertain in what periods the gradual enlargement of the lateral vessels in different situations may be accomplished. The instances of persons who have had obliterations of the larger Arteries, do not war- rant us suddenly to tie these vessels in an operation. When the whole process is committed to Nature, the larger vessels may contract only in proportion as the smaller branches enlarge ; for the change has often taken place insensibly. We are not therefore merely to consider the extent of the change, but the time and manner in which the change may be effected. Nature may provide against a disease that ap- proaches gradually, and sink under one of inferior violence that attacks by surprise; and hence we have often occasion to see that it is not always the

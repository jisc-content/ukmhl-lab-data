A ® ASCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. 143 I 8 never seen the case mentioned by Portal (a), where they all spring from a common trunk. If Lieutaud, and some others, following the ancients, have hap- pened to restrict the epithet Bronchial to one Artery, which they call by way of eminence the Bronchial, it has never been in consequence of minute and ac- curate investigation. They had seen it, and supposed that no other Bronchia! Artery existed, or that no other Artery, proceeding from the Aorta to the (a) “ Les Artferes Bronehiques sortent ordinairement de la “ face \uteneure de l’Aorte, au dessous de laBronche gauche, " loutes ensemule ou separement.” The following passage from Haller might, at first sight, seem to favour the opinion, that all the Brouchials originate occasionally by a common Trunk. “ Valde frequens est, utrumque Pulmonein habere “ ab eodem Truuco Arterioso ramos suos, quod Veteribus con- “ tigisse videtur, uam ex Aorta provenientem et unam, fere “ communi consensu describunt.”—Fascic. iti. p. 35. It is evident, however, from the preceding sentence, that Haller here is not describing a Trunk common to all the Bronchials, but merely the Bronchialis Communis; the Bronchial that rises without a fellow, and is afterwards distributed on the right and left Bronchi. The sentence immediately preceding is,' “ Ut ordine historiam istam tradamus, tenendum est, “ Arterias Bronchiales esse dextras, sinistras, communes, et “ vel omnes in uno subjecto vel aliquas adesse. A communi " initium faciam. Bis communes duas vidi, quarum utraque " in uno corpore ex Aorta, in altero, una ex Aorta, altera ex “ Intercostali venit Hi casus fuerunt inter viginti quuique “ corpora.”—Ibid. p. 36.

A DESCRIPTION or THE ARTERIES. Ill gularly point to the Proximal extremities of their bones. In short, the Nutritiae of these three bones point to the elbow joint. In the Sacral extremities, the corresponding Nutritial Arteries, which regularly enter in a slanting direction from the Popliteal aspect, run proximad in the Femur, and distad in both the Tibia and Fibula; or, in other words, theyr point from the knee joint. On comparing the extremities. Atlantal and Sacral therefore, are we to infer, that the different directions of these Arteries in the bones that correspond, and their similar directions in the bones that do not, de- pend on a difference and similarity of position in the attitudes of standing, sitting, or lying? or will it be thought more natural to suppose, that, as in the Teeth, these Arteries point towards the extremity where the bone is first completed in its growth, and first assumes that hardness and form to which it is destined. The Analogous Arteries in the Cow and the Horse, slant very little on entering the bone, and occasionally appear as if they entered in a direction perpendicular to the axis. RAMUS ANASTOMOTICUS Rises generally from the Humeral Artery, but sometimes from the Ulnar (6); sometimes from (6) See Bumsâ€™ Varieties ot the Larger Arteries.

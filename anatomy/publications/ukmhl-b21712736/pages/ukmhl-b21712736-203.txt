A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. 145 I 4 tery; sometimes from the Sternal Artery itself; sometimes from the Trunk of the Aorta, at the junction of the Ductus Arteriosus ; sometimes from the first Aortic Intercostal; sometimes from the first and second; sometimes ramified upon the Vertebrae; sometimes inosculating with the Inter- costals; and sometimes sending offâ€™ a Thymic branch, and the branch that accompanies the Phrenic nerve. The other Bronchials, when they rise not directly from the Aorta, but from neighbouring Arteries, as the Intercostals, or by common Trunks with (Eso- phageals (c), have more frequently this secondary origin on the right side than upon the left, a cir- cumstance that is very easily explained from the situation of the Aorta lying sinistrad of the Mesial Plane. It is proved by injections, and is generally know n, that the Bronchial Arteries inosculate with branches from the Pulmonic; and these inosculations are thought singular, as the blood that passes from the Bronchial vessels into the Pulmonic, must return by (c) When the Bronchials chance to have a common origin with the Intercostals, or CEsophageals, the larger division is considered as the Trunk, and the smaller as the branch. Hence some Anatomists speak of CEsophageals arising from Bronchials, and others, as Winslow, of Bronchials arising from CEsophageals.

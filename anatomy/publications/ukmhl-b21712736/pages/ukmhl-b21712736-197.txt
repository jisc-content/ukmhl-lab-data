A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. 1 til they inosculate, and form an arch. This arch is named the Digito-Vo ar, and sends off, from its convex aspect, a great number of small branches towards the Cutis, where the sense of Touch is the most exquisite. Near to the place where the Trunks converge, two of their branches, running anconad, also inosculate, and form an arch on the opposite aspect. This is the Digit*.Anconal arch., which sends off, from its convex aspect, a number of blanches that form a Plexus under the nails. The mode of ramification on the Thumb, is similar to that which is found on the fingers, though, in general, the Anconal branches be larger, and the Digito-Radial less uniform than that belong,ng to any of the fingers. This Digito-Radial, arising sometimes from a Volar branch of the Ulnar Arterv sometimes from the TbenaJ branch of the Radial' sometimes from that branch of the Radial that fur' nishes, also, the Digilo-Ufoar; sometimes, tho| h rely, from the Interosseal; and sometimes want- mg, when it usually happens that the duty is net. ormed by ramifications from the Digito.Ulnar, or the neighbouring Thena! and Anconal branches ha, spring from the Radial.

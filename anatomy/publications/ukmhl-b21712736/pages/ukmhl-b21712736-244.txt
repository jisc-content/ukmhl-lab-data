A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. from the Mesocolon; he admits also that not only erheyen, but a few others, have called it Hemorr- hoidal; that Eustachius has combined it in his figure with the larger Mesenteric; and that, in the figure given by Casserius, its form and principal anastomosis are both misrepresented. Haller him- self, yielding to the reasons advanced by Schel- hammer, thinks it should be called, and has actually called it Colica ,Sinistra. In his opinion, he has made this change agreeably to the laws which re- gulate the Nomenclature of Linnaeus. The name, if adopted, would certainly distinguish it from what im has called Colica Dextra, and Colica Dextra would sepn to imply, that there is also a Colica Shmira.' But was there any kind of necessity for such a name as Colica Dextra ? Did Linnams ever impose names upon the mere varieties of species, or would he have classed a varying branch of the larger Mesenteric with a primary branch from the Aorta, bearing a steady and uniform character? If this Artery lias suffered little change in the way of description, that is partly owing to its steadi- ness of origin, and general distribution, and partly, too, to what may be thought a rare instance of pru- dence n Anatomists, their attending more to its general character, than to individual and triflino- varieties that occasionally occur in its smaller branches. As some apology for Hallerâ€™s appellation.

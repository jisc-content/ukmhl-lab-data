A DESCRIPTION’ OF THE ARTERIES. 177 From one of the larger Hepatic branches towards the right, or sometimes from the Trunk of the Coeliac itself, a conspicuous branch is seen running dorsad of the first portion of the Duodenum, and passing that portion, is seen again reflected, sinistrad, upon the convexity of the Gastric arch, where the Gastrocolic Epiploon is attached. This branch, where it runs on the Stomach, being generally steady and uniform in its character, has very pro- perly received a name, and is called the Gaslro- epiploica Dextra. In its course, it sends branches to the Duodenum and Pancreas; and from a pre- valent, but unjustifiable practice of describing por- tions of the same vessel as separate Arteries, at one part, it has sometimes been named the Pancrcaiico- duodenalis, and described as a branch of that very Trunk, of which it is evidently the continuation (/). Where it runs on the Stomach towards the left, it sends out a number of lateral branches to be rami- fied on the Gastrocolic-epiploon, and lateral branches (Z) “ Pancreatico Duodenalis, dum retro Duodeni princi- “ pium, ante Pancreas descendit, dat ramos ipsi duodeno, “ alios parvos, alios longiores, ad flexionem transversam pri- “ mam: Ubi autem fiuem inferiorem est emensa Duodeni, vel “ paulo supra dat ramum Pancreaticum transversum quern alias “ Mesenterica producit.

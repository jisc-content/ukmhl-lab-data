The largest branch of the Hypo-iliac passes be- tween the two great trunks of the Ischiadic nerve and leaves the Pelvis at the highest part of the Iliac notch, to be ramified principally upon the muscles that are named Gluteal In its passage outward it sends a branch to the Os Ilium, and has scarcely emerged, when it divides into large branches, each of them taking a different direction from that of the tiunk. These branches, in different places, are ob- served to inosculate afterwards by ramuli with one another, and approaching the confines of the Glutei, Epigastrics. Tins branch, he observes, inosculates with an haca Antwa Minor, (Fagcic. v. p. 9.) from which it is evident, t hislhaca Antiea Minor is not the Circumflex ; probably the branch to winch he alludes in the first paragraph of Note 3 m the same page, an occasional branch, that rises very near o the Circumflex, and under the Integuments, ascends over the spine of the Ilinm, and upon the lateral parts of the Abdo- men ; sometimes as far as the eighth rib, he had seen it at times taking its origin from the Deep Femoral.

The Basi- lar Artery being thus formed, and also enveloped in the Tunica Arachnokles, extends coronad on the Basilar aspect of the Tuber Annulare, till it reaches as high as the posterior Clinoid processes of the Sella Turcica. Here it divides into two branches, which, united each with the Encephalic of its own side, by what is called the Arteria Commnnicans, are after- wards ramified partly on the middle, but principally on the Inial lobes of the Cerebrum.

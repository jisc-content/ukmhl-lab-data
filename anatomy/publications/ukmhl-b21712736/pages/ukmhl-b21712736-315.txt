A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. 257 I Anatomy, and which signifies in general what be- longs to the Cneme, or Leg. Instead also of the vague terms Anterior and Posterior, by which they are distinguished, and for which some of the older Anatomists make use of the terms External and In- ternal (n), I should have preferred the epithets Ro- tular and Popliteal. In the human species, the Crural Artery regular- ly divides into these two branches, which in all cases may, in the strictest propriety of language, be called Cnemial, but by no means Tibial. The Student is informed that sometimes the one, and sometimes the other of the two Tibial branches is wanting; not, in- deed, that he is to suppose that one of the Cnemial branches is wanting, but merely that one of them, happening to vary a little in its course, and in its situation, must, agreeably to the fashion of naming the Arteries, be now denominated a Peroneal, not a Tibial Artery. On comparing these Arteries with those that are termed Radial and Ulnar, the Tibialis Antica is that which corresponds, in its general character, with the Radial Artery, and the Tibialis Postica with the Ulnar. As the Radial Artery recedes from the Thenal aspect of the arm, to run on the Anconal (o) The Anterior Tibial, according to Hallbr, is the Tibialis Exterior of C. Bauhin, and the Tibialis Postica, the Internal Tibial of Keil.

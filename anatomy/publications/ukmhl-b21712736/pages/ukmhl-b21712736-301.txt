A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. 243 N 5 tcry, or the Hypo-iliac, is to supply a number of parts, and, from nearly the same place in its course, it may either send off its branches separately, or two or more of them differently combined in a common stem; that where the size of these branches is small, it may send them off in the greater numbers ; or in smaller numbers, if they happen to be large; and lastly, that branches, after they each take a separate course, may vary their size, their number of divisions, and their extent of ramification, as the neighbouring Arteries, to the same parts, furnish a greater or a less share of the general supply. Without, therefore, attempting to define what na- ture herself has not chosen to define, the precise termination of the Inguinal Portion of the Crural Ar- tery, I shall proceed to give some idea of those branches that usually originate directly, or indirect- ly, from the Crural Artery in that space interposed between the Ligament of Poupart, and where, in its progress, it approaches nearest the Trochanter Minor. Some of these may be termed simply Inguinal branches, of no determinate number or size, of course, or extent of ramification ; others may be named In- guinal rudics, from their being ramified on the Sexual organs ; two are the Circumflex Arteries of the Femur, and, though seldom the last, yet always the largest, is the Femoral Profunda.

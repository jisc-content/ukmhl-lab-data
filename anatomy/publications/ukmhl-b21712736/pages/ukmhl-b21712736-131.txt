A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. 7^ F 4 enter the tube, but are afterwards ramified upon the Involucra. Each Medullaris, so far as the Liga- mentum Denticulatum is continued, generally di- vides into two Ramuli (n), a Dorsal Ramulus enter- ing the Dorsal, and a Sternal entering the Sternal canal. The other branches entering the tube of the Ver- tebral column, are those which are ramified on the Dura Mater and Involucrum Vertebrarum ; the first might be named the Vertebro-Meningeal, the latter the Vertebro-Involucral Arteries. The Vertebro- Meningeal are smaller in size, and fewer in number than the Vertebro-Involucral, the last are larger, and even more numerous than the Medullares ; they enter at each Inter-vertebral space from the Atlas to the Coccyx, and, when they enter, generally send off four Ramuli, two of them running in opposite direc- tions, allantad and sacrad, to unite with their fellows of the neighbouring interstices on the same side; and two running mesiad, one by the Dorsal, and the other by the Sternal part of the tube, to unite with («) “ Ejusmodi Medullares Arteriae alia? Anteriores sunt, alia; “ posteriores, idque discrimen superest, quam longum est " Ligumentum denticulatum, nempe ad Pollicem fere supra “ finem Medulla: Spinalis priniamque LumborumYertebram.” —Haller, Fatcic, vii. p. 15.

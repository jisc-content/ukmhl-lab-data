A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. 7 coats of the vessels within the Pericardium. Some of their branches are even reflected on the Pericar- dium, where they inosculate with small branches of what are called the internal Mammaries, and others accompanying the large vessels as far as the lungs, have been observed to inosculate with the Bronchials. Their branches to the Auricles, the coats of the vessels, and the Pericardium, when compared to those that are ramified on the Ventricles, are extremely small. Some exhalant branches opening into the Ven- tricles, and occasionally injected from communicating veins, as well as from their trunks, have sometimes been viewed as belonging to the Arteries, and some- times again, as belonging to the Veins. As belonging to the Arteries, they have been termed the Arteries of Vieussenius; as belonging to the Veins, the Veins of Thebesius. Sabatier never could observe these vessels. Portal saw them, and probably the success of tracing and injecting them, depends much upon the state of the heart and vessels at the time. Not- withstanding the facility with which Thebesius made his Probes to pass through them in a Bullockâ€™s heart, I doubt much, if they ever admitted red globules in the healthy and living state of that organ.

136 A description of the arteries. Arterial Trunk that appears on the Anconal. It invariably runs ulnad on this aspect, as far as the Metacarpal bone of the fore-finger, and often sends onward a considerable branch that turns and runs distcid, between the Metacarpal bone of the fore and the middle finger. From the Trunk, in this course, “ °radas’ Arcum Vote profund urn, Ramos Volares Interosseos, “ Nutritias Uln* Radiique, circumflexas Humeri, et alia rec- tius proposuit, et nostris laboribus usus et suis.” “ Eut, “ Ego,” says Haller, “ Ego Minutos rerum fines fere ubique " adjeci, et perforantes superiores, inferiores, Interosseas Dor- " sales>.Interosseas Media?, et alia quae minus decet " rePet"sse-”—Pref. ad. Fascia, vi. By tracing the Minutos rerum fines, lie was led to perceive the obvious communi- cations between the branches, upon the Anconal and the Volar aspects ; and the observation that he makes respecting them is certainly just. It is only singular, that lie should hare confined to the hand, a remark, which, in general language, might have been extended to the whole system. It is now well known, that inosculations, similar in their object, though differ- ing often in mode and degree, occur in every part of the struc- ture j the circulation in every part being equally free, proper- tied to the demands of the organs j and interruptions equally prevented by various textures of communicating branches As to the difference of relative magnitude in these branches, that often is a matter of less importance than their difference in number, and the difference of the mode in which they commu- nicate. It must be evident, that in what way soever a Vascu- lar Plexus happens to be formed, its communicating branches will fall to be necessarily larger or less, proportioned to the quantity of blood required, and proportioned to the frequency

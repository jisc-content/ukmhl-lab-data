33 A DESCRIPTION OF T11E ARTERIES. Articular depression, sending a Ramulus through the fissure of Glasserus, to inosculate in the Tympanum with the Stylomastoid ; a branch too that penetrates verse branches from the Temporal Artery. But on no ac- count do they seem entitled to rank with the branches regu- larly proceeding from the Pericephalic. The C'ontinuator of Bichat observes, that the several branches of the Pericephalic may be arranged into three classes. The first class ramified on the organs of voice and respiration. The second on the first organs of Digestion, Aux premiers organes de la Digestion. The third on the face, which class, he says, is naturally di- vided into two orders, one ramified towards the surface, and the other ramified through the deep cavities. But admitting these arrangements, and that the organs of mastication and deglutition, are organs of digestion, what purposes, curious or useful, are such arrangements calculated to serve ? Do these Arteries, in consequence of any difference of function exercised by the organs on which they are rami- fied, exhibit any difference of Character, Generic or Specific, by which we can distinguish an Artery ramified on an organ of voice, from an Artery ramified on an organ of Digestion. Where Arteries branch in a similar manner, where they happen to be ramified on the parts adjacent, where they in- osculate, and where one is observed occasionally to supply the place of another, the distinctions between them, are more in the name, the situation, and relative magnitude, than in their functions. Nothing is easier than in this way to class and arrange from fancy or whim, and nothing more difficult than to class and arrange after the manner of a Bacon or a Linneeus. The first

1(56 A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. one from the Aorta ; or one from the Renal, anil one from the Aorta ; or one from the first Lumbar Artery (</), and the other from either the Coeliac or Aorta; or one from the Trunk of the Coeliac Ar- tery, and another from a branch of the same Artery. In one instance, Haller saw three, two from the Trunk, and one from a branch of the Coeliac; and in another four, two from the Aorta, and two from the Cce- hac. But, were we to mark every difference in number, in mode of origin, in relative distances, in magnitude' situation, in arrangement and extent of ramification, and in the varieties of inosculation, instead of a page, we might fill a volume, not only with the varieties of the Phrenies, but of many other Arteries. Our business in examining such varieties, should be to ascertain what is regular, and what is variable in the character of an Artery, after obtaining the general result upon the fair principles of induction, to disregard, in our description, every future variety that does not affect the general conclusion previously established. After the many varieties he had seen, and of which he had read respecting the Phrenies, at the time when he published his second Fasciculus in 1745, Haller had continued to observe, and record (4) “ La Cceliaque, la premiere Loiubaire droite produisent “ trfcs-souvent la Diaphragmatique de ce Cote.”—Lieulaud.

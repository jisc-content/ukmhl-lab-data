38 A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. Haller saw once the Occipital Artery, and once the Pharyngeal, taking their rise from it. Between the Foramen, and the place where it penetrates the Dura Mater, minute injections have shown it, when passing near the cavity of the Tym- panum, sending in a branch to inosculate with the branch from the Meningeal, and when a little on- ward, sending a branch through the inial extremity of the Pterygoid canal, to inosculate with a branch from the highest Pharyngeal. The most ordinary injections are sufficient to show two of the branches which it gives out in the Receptaculum, or Cavernous Sinus, these last being generally ramified more or less extensively on the Dura Mater, on the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth pair of nerves; and it has / â€¢ been shown by Haller and Morgagni to have been Itamuli of these branches that were taken for fila- ments of the fifth pair, descending basilad to the first Ganglion of the great Intercostal. From the place where it penetrates the Dura Matei-, to where it divides into the Arteriae Syl- viana and Callosa, may generally be seen a cluster of small branches ramified upon the contiguous parts, as the Optic nerves, the Pituitary Gland, and the Infundibulum, while one considerably larger than the rest, has sometimes been observed passing over a crus of the Cerebrum, accompanying, for a while. -

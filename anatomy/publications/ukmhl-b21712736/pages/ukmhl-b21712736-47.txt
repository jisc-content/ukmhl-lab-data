INTRODUCTION. XIX u before. On what principle is this singular art of description founded ? Linnaeus will inform us: Ex- amining a number of individuals, he marked the cha- racters that were uniform, permanent, and common to them all. Of these he selected the most obvious, for the purpose of being readily observed, and made them few, foi the purpose of being easily remember- ed : These constituted the characters of his Species. Comparing again a number of species, he marked the characters that were permanent, uniform, and com- mon to them : These constituted the characters of his Genera. Comparing the Genera, in the same way, he discovered the characters which distinguished the Orders; and comparing the Orders, the marks, and characters that distinguished his Classes. By these contrii ances, the Naturalist can now readily deter- mine the particular species to which a plant or ani- mal belongs; and had, therefore, a botanist accom- panied Kotzbue in his exile to Siberia, he, in two or three words, could have conveyed a precise idea of the species of the plant which that poet, after a de- scription of fully two pages, has left undetermined. In describing the four ramified systems, as occur- ring in man and the lower animals, under a great va- liety of forms, we perhaps, like the naturalist, might find it necessary to divide each into different Orders,

35 A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. costal, and the Rectus Capitis Internus dorsad, pro- ceeds through a loose cellular membrane (g) to the base of the Cranium. Arriving at the base, it im- mediately enters the Foramen Caroticum, follows the Cour des Aides fut atteiut d’une violente Esquinancie par l’inflammation des Amygdales j on crut reconnoitre un abc£s dans l’une d’elles. Un Chirurgien habile voulut, 4 cet effet, l’ouvrir avec le Pharyngotome ; mais il la dirigea si mal, ou l’arttire Tonsillaire etoit si grosse, qu’ayant ete ouverte, il sur- Tint one Hemorragie qui fut bientot mortelle. (g) Partly from the laxness of the Cellular membrane, and partly from the mode in which it is attached to the coats of this Artery, the Encephalic, between its origin and Foramen Caroticum, is generally inflected more or less by the force of our injections, and, for aught I know, may sometimes be in- flected in a simitar manner by the force of the blood. Such an inflection, more or less increased in proportion to the force exerted by the Heart, may serve to regulate the momentum of the blood as it flows towards the Brain, while the windings of the Artery through the canal, like the windings of the Vertebral through the transverse processes, although they contribute to lessen the momentum, cannot vary their effects according to circumstances. In head-achs, in megrim, and even in giddi- ness, the effects of this momentum are usually felt where the Arterial blood is accelerated, and the Venous blood propor- tionally retarded by an inclination of the head downwards. In comparative Anatomy, it has been observed, that in those animals where the Encephalic proceeds more directly through the base of the Cranium, it is seen, where it passes through the canal, dividing into numbers of very small convoluted vessels

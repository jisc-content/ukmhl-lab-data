A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. 80 The Sternal Artery having passed the Cartilage of the seventh rib, and sent branches to the Ensi- form Cartilage, sends off another lateral branch, not much inferior to what remains of the rest of the Trunk. This lateral branch is seen afterwards spreading on the central aspect of the Transversus Abdominis, and inosculating with Ramuli from the Epigastric ([v). The branches sent from the Sternal Artery to the adjoining Viscera of the Thorax, are branches rami- fied on the Mediastinum, the Thymic Glands (to), the Pericardium, and the branches that accom- pany the Phrenic nerve towards the Diaphragm. The branches, however, that happen to be ramified on these Viscera, are not so regularly from the Sternal Artery, as the previous branches to the Parities. (o) Mr. Bums acquaints me by letter, that he lately saw the Sternal Artery sending off a lateral branch at the place where it passes the first rib, and that this branch, not inferior in size to one of the Intercostals, extended as far as the fifth rib ; and in a subject about 12 years of age, was three inches dis- tant from the place where the ribs are joined to their Car- tilages. In short, its course, on the central aspect, appears to have been opposite and commensurate to that of the Arteria Thoracica Altera, represented by Haller in his sixth Fasciculus, Tab. 1.

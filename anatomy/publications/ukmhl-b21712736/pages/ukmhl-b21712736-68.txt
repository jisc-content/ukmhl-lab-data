10 A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. and gives out occasionally the Thymic, the Me- diastinal, the Pericardiac, and the Diaphragmatic- branches, that usually arise from the Brachial Artery. ARTERLE CEPHALICiE, seu Carotides Communes. Of these two Arteries, the right is the shorter, and from the inclinations of the Aorta, situated more to the Sternal aspect. Both are always in the close vicinity of the Trachea, appearing first near one ano- ther on its Sternal aspect, but soon diverging allantad and dorsad towards the seat of the Longi Colli, and Recti Capitis Interni Majores; here they run parallel alongthesides of itand the (Esophagus,and soon after, when nearly opposite the Atlantal margin of the Thy- roid Cartilage, separate each into two branches (t); the Encephalic ramified chiefly on the parts within be allowed to obtain some credit for his assertion; and, indeed, Soemmerring, who describes here a number of exceptions from the general rule, has described but few- from liis own ob- servation. (i) In rare cases, the Cephalics send out anomalous branches before they divide. In other rare cases they divide sooner, and in cases still rarer divide not at all; the continued Trunks, as they run along to the base of the Cranium, sending off the branches that usually belong to the Pericephalics when they are present.

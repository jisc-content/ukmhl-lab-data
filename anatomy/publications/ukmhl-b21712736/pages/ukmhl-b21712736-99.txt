A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. 41 later crosses it (&) coroiiad towards the mesial side of the Orbit, from whence, emerging between the pully of the Trochlear muscle, and the Palpebral ligament, it runs along the side of the nose (/), and there inosculates with branches from the Labial and Orbito-maxillary. From the great irregularity in the origin of its branches, without regarding whether they be pri- mary, secondary, or ternary, derived immediately or remotely from the trunk, I shall enumerate the several parts on which it is ramified. In the pro- gress of its course, branches are sent to the Dura fit) Ad decursum Opthalmicae addere quoque visum est, illam quoque sub nervo Optieo progressam animadversam fuisse. Zinn. (/) When it runs on the nose, it is usually termed the Nasal branch of the Opthalmie, although from its general size and direction in the several adult preparations 1 have seen, it has oftener appeared the continuation of the trunk, than the Frontal branch, which, though in the foetus it be sometimes more than equal in size, has a different direction from that of the previous part of the Opthalmie. But the size of Arteries naturally vary in proportion to the parts on which they are ramified ; and it is known, that the bones of the face compared to the bones forming the Cranium, are propor- tionally larger in the adult, than they are in the foetus. “ Fron- “ tabs Arteria truncus est Opthalmicai, aliquandotamen minor “ nasali ut pro ejus ramo possit haberi.” Haller, Fustic hi.— referring to its appearance in the head of an adult.

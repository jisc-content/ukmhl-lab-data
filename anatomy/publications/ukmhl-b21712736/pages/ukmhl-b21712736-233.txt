A DESCRIPTION OP THE ARTERIES. 175 ARTERt-E HEPATICJ5. Seven times in thirty Haller saw the right lobe of the Liver supplied by a branch, that, rising from the Superior Mesenteric, run dorsad of the right ex- Sinistra of Bauhin, is supposed by Haller to have been the same as a Ramus Dexter of bis Coronaria Superior, a branch towards the left of the Stomach, although to the right of the Coronary trunk. A branch running in an opposite direction towards the Py- lorus, and on the same side of the arch, is named Coronaria Dextra by Haller, Pylorica by Glisson, Gaslrica Dextra by Verheyen, and others. A Gastrica Dextra Minor of Walther, is supposed by Haller to have been the same as his Pylorica Superior, the Gastrica Dextra of Winslow, Lieutaud, Kulm, and Boudon, the Gastrica Major of hPiGEnus, and the Coronaria Inferior of Cowper, the same as the Gastro-cpiploica Dextra of Bauhin, Diemberbroeck, Glisson, Hbister, and others. Haller has mentioned an Epiploica posterior, Lieutaud an E]ii- ploica dextra and an Epiploica parva, different from all these previous branches. The Pancreutico Duodenalis of Haller, the Duodenal of Winslow and Lieutaud, and the Intestinalis of Bauhin, though a small branch running along the concave side of the second, and a part occasionally of the third flexure of the Duodenum, is made by Haller, the trunk of the Gastro Epiploica dextra, not on account of its size, for it is smaller than its branch, but on account of its direction. The confusion of language is beyond a parallel, when we come to name the fleeting varieties, in number, origin, and ramification, that arc exhibited by the smaller Pyloric, Duodenal, Pancreatic, and Cystic branches.

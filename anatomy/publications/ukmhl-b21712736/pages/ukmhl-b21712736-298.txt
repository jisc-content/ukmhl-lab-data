£40 a description or the arteries. the middle of the Ligament of Pnnmrt f 6 01 1 °upart, measuring Irom the Symphysis, to the highest Anterior Spine of t ie hun, (f); runs centrad of the Fascia and Inguinal Glands, is surrounded by much adipose substance «nd unusually strong Cellular membrane; has the Crural nerve and Iliacus Internus situated laterad the Pectineus and the Vein mesiad. Murray has tailed it the Common Femoral, and makes it to send off the Inguinal Pudics, and to terminate at the ori- gin of the Deep Femoral. The termination is the only thing doubtful. The question occurs, where does the Deep Femoral originate ? In one prepara- tion in my possession, and where there was no re- traction of the vessels, it rises where the trunk of the Crural Artery sinks under the Sartorius, and by actual measurement at more than the distance of two inches beyond the origin of the Circum- flex Arteries, which rise together by a common tiunk from the Crural Artery. Halier has seen it taking its origin, in mo Iliaco Interno, at the lowest part of the Iliacus, or at its insertion in the Tro- chanter Minor; he has seen it rising, medio loco fere, at nearly an equal distance from the Trochanter Minor and Pubis ; and has seen it rising before any of the Inguinal Pudics, in summofere Iliaco, at near- ffj “Au milieu de l’espace compris entre PEpine anteri- eure superieure de l’os des tie* et la Symphyse du Pubis.”-

A DESCRIPTION OF TIIE ARTERIES. 2 sudden, changing its course, it bends -sin is trad dor- sad and sacrad, towards the third Vertebra of the Thorax. From this place, resting on the side of the Vertebral Column, a little to the left of the Mesial Plane (6), it advances to the Diaphragm, passes between the Crura of that muscle, enters the Abdomen, gra- dually inclining more towards the right, till it reaches the seat of the Mesial Plane, and at last, near the fifth of the Lumbar Vertebrae, divides equally into two large branches, that supply the Pelvis and Sacral extremities The part between the Ven- tricle, and where it first reaches the Vertebrae, has been named its Arch. From the Arch to the Dia- phragm, it is called Thoracic (c), and from the Dia- phragm to its division. Abdominal Aorta. Its three Valves are at its commencement; when they fall back from its centre to its sides, they cover three depressions, which have been named the Sinuses of Morgagni. (b) In these singular cases, where the apex of the heart points to the right, the situation and course of this Artery, as to right and left, will be somewhat reversed. (c) It is hard to conceive what kind of ideas floated in the brain, when the term Thoracic was first employed to distinguish this part of the Aorta from its Arch: Both are equally in the cavity of the Thorax ; and if both do not equally furnish it with blood, yet both evidently furnish a share. The arc bed and the straight Thoracic Aorta, though not absolutely correct, would have certainly been a language more clear and distinct.

A description of the arteries. Animals that require a determinate range of ani- mal temperature, must, while in health, evolve less Caloric, when they are surrounded by a higher tem- perature, and more Caloric, when they are surround- ed by a lower temperature, than that of the vital standard within them. The Foetus in Utero is constantly surrounded by a temperature as high as that of the parent. To preserve, therefore, its natural range of animal tem- perature, it must necessarily after birth, when it is surrounded by a lower temperature, evolve a greater quantity of Caloric. This may in some measure ex- plain, why, previous to birth, much of the blood that flows m the Aorta, returns to the Aorta through the Ductus Arteriosus and Foramen Ovale (c), without confertorestet consumptor omnium, idemque, quoconque „ 1WT’ ClU‘Cta distUrbat ac diss,'Pat Contra Me corpo^eus, vital,s et salutaris, omnia conservat, alit, auget, sustmet, sensusque afficit.”—aw, Cap. (c) The Foramen Ovale is frequently found partially open even at a late period of life; and in a-female arrived at ma- tunty, and whose Heart and Thorax, 1 demonstrated in my Class, it remained almost entirely open, yet the Lungs quite sound, the appearance not bloated, nor the muscles more flac- cid than usual. After every inquiry, I am still ignorant of the symptoms with which this structure was attended. Where the Foramen continues open in the adult, the Lungs are deprived of their usual proportion of circulating flu,d. The Continuator of Bichat mentions a case where they had more than their usual proportion: A large branch from the Abdominal part of the Aorta, ascended in the Thorax, divided

A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. 1Q9 fied upon the Parietes of the Thorax. They rise similarly from the Aorta, and generally in pairs; though it sometimes happens that two on the same, and two even on the opposite sides, arise together by a common trunk. Like the Intereostals, they send branches to the Vertebral column, the Vertebral tube, and the parts within it (e) ; send branches peri- pherad to the muscles and the Incumbent Integu- ments, turn round by the lateral aspects, and, as they are situated, inosculate with branches of the Sternal Arteries, with lateral branches of the Epigastrics, or with branches from the Circumflex Iliacs. In their course, they regularly communicate with their fellows of the same side, but without dividing like the In- tercostals. Their number varies along with the number of the Lumbar Vertebrae; and even when the number of Vertebrae is regular. Anatomists dif- fer as to the number of the Lumbar Arteries in their mode of reckoning. Those who reckon, among the Intereostals, the branch that follows the Sacral mar- gin of the last rib, have five pairs ; while those who restrict the epithet Intercostal to the branches that run in the Costal interstices, have a pair more. Haller adopts the last mode of reckoning, and has six pairs. These pairs he describes separately, though few of them differ in any obvious or permanent cha- fe) See Intereostals.

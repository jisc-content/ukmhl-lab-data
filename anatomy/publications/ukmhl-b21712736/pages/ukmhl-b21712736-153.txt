A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. 95 passes under the Coracobrachial is, and under the short head of the Biceps ; sends off branches to these muscles, and not unfrequently to the Subscapular, the long head of the Triceps Extensor, the Latissi- mus Dorsi, and sometimes to the Deltoid. It branches also on the groove itself, on the Tendons of the Biceps and Pectoral muscles, on the Periosteum and Capsular Ligament, inosculating by twigs with the other Circumflex, by twigs with the Circumflex Scapular branch, and b}' some twigs, even with the deep Arteries of the Humerus. The larger Circumflex, named the Posterior, runs round in an opposite direction by the Anconal aspect of the Humerus, passing, in its course, be- tween the head of the Triceps and Humerus, and between the Sacral Costa of the Scapula and Teres Major. It is principally expended upon the Del- toid; but sends, also, at times, small branches to the Subscapular muscle, the Coracobrachialis, the Teres Minor, the Bocipital groove, the Periosteum and Capsvdar Ligament, inosculating with the branches of other Arteries that happen to be ramified on these parts. With respect to their origin, these two Arteries are very irregular. They sometimes rise by separate trunks from the Axillary Portion ; sometimes, again, the one arises from the Axillary Portion, while the other arises from its Scapular branch; sometimes Â« 3

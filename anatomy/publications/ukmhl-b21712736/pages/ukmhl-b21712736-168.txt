Ei e it reaches the bone, it often sends branches to neighbouring muscles and the Periosteum, and on these parts is differently ramified in different indi- viduals. It is not always a regular branch of tho Humeral Artery (y) • it sometimes springs from one of the branches in the vicinity of the place where it enters; it is sometimes wanting (2), and instead of one, there are sometimes two (a), which from their size, and the place where they enter, appear to have an equal claim to the title. In all cases, the • Nutritia Humeri entering the bone in a slanting direction, from the Thenal aspect, regftlarly points to its Distal extremity, while the Nutritiae of the Ulna and Radius, enternig also in a slanting direction from the Thenal aspect, as re- (y) “ Alias Nutritia propago Rami est, qui altera Pro- “ fund a vocari potest”—Haller, Fascic. vi. p. 21.

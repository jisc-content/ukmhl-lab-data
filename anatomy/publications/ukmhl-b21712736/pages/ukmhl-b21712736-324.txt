26j6 A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. styled by Haller Peronrn. Arnica, assisting the An. tenor Td,ml Artery in furnishing branches to the Ancles and Tarsus. The Peroneal, termed now c.onca Poahca, continues its course behind the El ternal or Fibular Ancle to the Os Calcis, whence some of its branches have been seen inosculating with that branch of tile Tibial Artery called Plan, tans Externus. In those cases where the Tibial Artery is im. peded in its functions, the Peroneal is found to enlarge as the Tibial diminishes, and supplying the unctions, or part of the functions of the Tibial° Ar- tery, the Tibial is said either to be wanting or only a branch of the Peroneal, in which case the lnternal Pl“Mar has been also found wanting (s). the place where it sends off the Arteries of the Leg, than the Brachial Artery as to the place where it sends off the Arteries of the Fore-arm. To form a judgment from the numerous ob- servations already made, it must be seldom, and extremely seldom, that any of these three Arteries of the Leg take their origin proximad of the Knee Joint, or run between its Capsular Ligament and the Popliteus; and perhaps one cause of this steadiness may be, that the voluntary motions of the Sacral Extremities are not so numerous, nor yet so varied as those of the Atlantal. (-0 ‘ The Posterior Tibial is sometimes wanting, in which case the Peroneal is very large, and sends branches to the muscles which ought to be supplied by the Tibial; it also sends a large branch into the sole of the Foot; but I have in these cases found the Internal Plantar Artery wanting."—Let- ter from Mr. Burns.

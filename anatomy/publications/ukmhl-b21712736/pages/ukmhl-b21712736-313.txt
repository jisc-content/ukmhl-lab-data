255 A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. DISTO-ARTICU LARES, or, Articulares Inferiores, Externa, et Interna. The two Inferior or Disto-Articulars, circum- flected laterad, and nearer to the Joint and the La- teral Ligaments, unite more conspicuously in form- ing the Plexus with the recurrent branches from the Leg. In their course, they send branches to the Soleus, to the Popliteus, and the Gastrocnemius, to the Flexor Tendons, to the Capsular Ligament, the Lateral Ligaments, the Ligament of the Patella, and to the two Semilunar Cartilages ; and often inoscu- late on the parts more immediately connected with the Joint by very minute, though perceptible branch- es of the Azygos Articular. AUTICULARIS AZVGA, or, Articularis Media. This Azygos branch, arising from the Trunk, or from one of the two Proximo-Articulars, runs distad, and spreads, between the Condyles, on the Capsular Ligament, the adipose substance, the Semilunar Car- tilages, and the Crucial Ligaments, inosculating with all the adjoining branches.

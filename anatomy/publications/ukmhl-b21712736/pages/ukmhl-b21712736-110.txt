A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES 52 Artery, like the preceding, being intended for the nourishment of the brain, must also send, through the medium of its branches, innumerable Ramuli to the Cerebral substance, although few of their number, excepting those conveying red blood, can ever be traced by the Anatomist. Even the Ramuli conveying red blood are, in ge- I neral, so small, that were it not for blood oozing out upon the dissections of the Medullary substance, they would not unfrequently escape our notice; but grant- ' ing they could be readily discerned, so numerous and minute are the divisions and anastomoses of both the Encephalic and Vertebral Arteries, imme- diately before they enter the Cerebrum, the Cere- bellum, and Medulla Oblongata, that the Anatomist could hardly, with any degree of propriety, extend his description beyond the larger ramifications that are seen spreading on the Pia Mater, running on the surface of the Cerebral organs, or entering into the Plexus Choroides. are unexceptionable, although the fact, that Arteries extend their ramifications between the Pia and the Dura Mater, inde- pendent of any previous disease, be not supported by general Analogy.

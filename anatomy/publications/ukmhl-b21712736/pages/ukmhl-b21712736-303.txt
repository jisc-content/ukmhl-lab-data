A DESCRIPTION OP THE ARTERIES. 245 part of its way; sometimes two or more of them have sprung from a common stem ; and sometimes their places have been supplied by the neighbouring Arteries. PUDIC/E INGUINALES. I have chosen this name to distinguish them from the Pudic that originates in the Pelvis. They are ramified on the parts that cover the Symphysis, on the Scrotum in males, on the Labia in females; some have been seen extending their branches on the Dorsum of the Penis as far as the Prepuce. They inosculate with branches of the Pelvien Pudic, of the Obturatoria, and of the Spermatic ; and also with branches reflected on the cord from the Epi- gastric. The nearest in origin to the Ligament of Poupart, arise either from the Crural Artery, or from the Profunda, the more distal from the Crural Artery beyond the Profunda. Some mention three, a Superior, Middle, and an Inferior j but their number is not definite, nor is their extent of ramification; and when two of them arise by a common stem, they are counted but as one.

A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. 149 i 6 vitality in the Lungs; and that, therefore, the blood of the Vena Arterialis, or Pulmonic Artery, instead of returning to the right Ventricle, flowed through the Atieria Venalis, or Systemic Veins, and the left Ventricle to the Aorta. As this idea of the vital blood being generated in the Lungs had never occurred, as he imagined, to any Anatomist before his time, he seems anxious to establish its truth against the sceptical Aristotelians (f), to whom, he was certain, it would appear para- doxical and absurd. One of the arguments, there- fore, which he brings in support of the hypothesis, for with him it was nothing but an hypothesis, is, that if vital blood, or the blood that pulsates, be not generated in the Lungs, where it mixes with the air, and is sent from the Arteries into the Veins “ somniavit, incredulis, atque Aristotelicis paradoxon videri “ debeat, quos oro rogoque, lit Pulmonis magnitudinem con- “ templentur qua: absque vitali sanguine permanere non po- “ terat: Cum nulia sit tarn minima corporis particula, quas “ illo destituatur. Quod si vitalis hie sanguis in Pulmonibus “ non gignitur : a qua parte transmitti poteratj praeterquam “ ab Aorta Arteria ? At ab Aorta Arteria ramus nullus, ueque “ magnus neque parvulus ad Pulmones mittitur.”—Lib. xi. cap. 2. De Re Anatomies. (f) Aristotle thought that the blood flowed backwards and forwards in the same channels, like the tides of the Euripus between Attica and Euboea.

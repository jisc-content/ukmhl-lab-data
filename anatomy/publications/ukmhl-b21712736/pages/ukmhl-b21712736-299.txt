241 A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. N 4 ly the highest part of the Iliaeus (g). If he means the most elevated part of the Iliaeus, or the part at the greatest perpendicular distance from the table or ground, when the subject lay supine, it rose from the Crural a little atlantad of the Ligament of Pou- part, and within the Pelvis ; if he means the most Atlantal part of the Iliaeus, which I think he does not, it rose near to the Hypo-iliac. Mr. Burns, at * the time that he published his Varieties of the Larger Arteries, had seen it, in three different subjects, springing from the Crural within the Pelvis. In short, this Artery rises sometimes proximad, and sometimes dislad of the Inguinal Pudics, and the Circumflex Arteries; sometimes it gives off an In- (g) “ In imo Iliaco Interne nascitur plerumque Profunda Fe- “ moris quae frequentius Circumflexam internam et externam “generat.”—Halter, Fascic. V. p. 10. in another part of the same column, he says : “ Nascitur Profunda in musculo Iliaco, “ quern ad finera sequitur, medio loco fere orta inter Os Pubis " etTrochanterem minorem j” but this last passage has no re- ference to the general or common origin of the Artery; only to its origin in particular cases as represented in the first and second plate of his fifth Fasciculus, and in the front view of the whole body, in his eighth Fasciculus. From not attending to these references, Boyer was misled where he says: “ Elle “ (l’Artere Profonde) nait de la partie posterieure et un peu “ exteroe de cette Artfere, (la Crurale) vis~d-vis le milieu de “ I’espace compris entre le Pubis et le petit trochanter, quelquC- “ fois plus baut, mais rarement plus bas.”

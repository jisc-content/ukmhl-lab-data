If a Peroneal Artery be present, the Pos- terior Tibial unites with it often through the me- dium of its branches ; if not present, the Tibial sends off other branches to supply the deficiency, communicates with the Anterior Tibial by perfo- rating branches that pass through the Ligament, and by branches that ramify upon the Tibial and Fibular aspects. Having reached the Os Calcis, it distributes branches to the Sinuosity, and the parts around it; and, through the medium of these branches, inosculating with the other Arteries adja- cent, it divides at last into the two branches that are termed Plantar. RAMI PLANTARES. The Plantar branches are those which supply the sole of the Foot, and which run upon the Tibial and Fibular sides ; the one running on the Tibial side, being the Internal; and the other on the Fibular side, the External. The External is properly the Trunk continued; the Internal has often more the

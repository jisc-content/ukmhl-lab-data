SI A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. The Pterygopalatine, or Plerygopalatines, pass through the Pterygopalatine canal branch on the Velum, Uvula, and Tonsils, and the Palate of the mouth, where a branch is reflected through the Foramen Incisivum to the nostrils. The Sphenopalatine, or Sphenopalatines, are rami- fied extensively through the cavity of the nostrils, and more especially towards the coronal and the inial aspects. The Suprema Pharyngea, or highest Pharyngeal, when it is present, sends a branch to the Vidian Foramen, and branches to the body of the Os Sphe- noides and Cephalopharyngei. The trunk, continued through the canal in the bottom of the Orbit, gives sometimes out a branch that runs back on the second branch of the fifth 9 pair to the Dura Mater; it also gives branches to the Periosteum within the Orbit, branches that in- osculate with ramifications of the Opthalmic, and branches that descend to the Maxillary Antre. ARTERIA TEMPORALIS. This Artery continues the direction of the Peri- cephalic, runs through the substance of the Parotid, and proceeding coronad between the Auricle and the

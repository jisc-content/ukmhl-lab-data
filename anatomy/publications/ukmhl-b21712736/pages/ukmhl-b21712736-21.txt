XV PREFACE. belonging to an order, or of the species belonging to a genus, regularly depict the characters of each, and leave not the reader, from the observation of a.single instance, to form a conjectural idea of the rest. In describing the Anatomy of the Human Body, the practice is different; we have no occasion for either generic or specific distinctions, unless where we mean to institute comparisons; we have only to describe a specific structure, and the prominent varieties which its several organs occasionally exhibit. In de- picting these, it has been usual, for the reasons as- signed, to depict only one of the varieties, generally, the most common, and to notice the others, if noticed at all, in verbal description. Anatomical plates, therefore, representing one of the comVnon varieties of an organ, should, if properly understood, be only an incitement to study the rest. The absurd, but too prevalent notion, that these are expressive of cer- tain generic or specific characters; that they super- sede the necessity of reading, or of examining the organs themselves in all their varieties, has induced a degree of indifference and supineness, that has been injurious to the progress of Anatomy. Even the splendid Anatomical plates of Albinus and Haller have, from this cause, instead of promoting, rather retarded the spirit of inquiry, and withdrawn the attention from the study and pursuit of general truths to which science aspires, to the contemplation

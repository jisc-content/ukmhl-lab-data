** A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. central aspect, distributing, in its course, branches to the Rectus, the Transversus Abdominis, and Ob* liquus Internus, inosculating freely under the Rectus with a lateral division of the Sternal Artery, by lateral branches with most of the Lumbars, and by branches that ascend with two or three of the last Intercostals. As to the precise point of its origin, it is sometimes higher, and sometimes lower in the Iliac Portion of the Crural Artery; sometimes it rises by a common trunk with the Obturatoria ; sometimes again by a common trunk with «the Circumflex Iliac (w).

Monro, Jun. has requested me here to correct the error that has crept into his work, where it is said. p. 426, that the Epigastric sometimes arises from the Pudic Artery. In dried preparations of the .Sacral extremities, where the Arteries are retracted, the Epigastric generally appears to arise e\ond the ligament of P.apart in the region of the Groin, re- presenting that species of variety where it originates in'the Common Femoral.

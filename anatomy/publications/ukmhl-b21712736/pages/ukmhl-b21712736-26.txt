The fate of Haller in some respects was not much better: Equally zealous, and equally industrious as opponent was the more impudent, as he was himself destitute of that knowledge, which might have made him a competent judge of learning. The celebrated Gmelin, who lived at the same time at St. Petersburgh, delineates his character in these words: * Siegesbeck has scarcely a superCcial knowledge of Botany; he understands the writings of others as "little as he knows himself; he is contented with the bare names of plants suggested to him by his sterile brain; destitute of all penetra- tion.”—Stoever’s life of Linnceus, translated ,aj Trapp, § vi.

The vessels of the Uterus gradually enlarge in dixmeter and length, in proportion as the period of pregnancy advances, and again contract in length and diameter after parturition. In the healing of Wounds, Abscesses, and Ulcers, Arteries form new inosculations, and send out num- bers of new branches.

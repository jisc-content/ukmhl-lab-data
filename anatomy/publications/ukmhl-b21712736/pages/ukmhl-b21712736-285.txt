A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. 227 haps more, than the immediate effects of the knife, if in the hands of a dexterous Surgeon. It is customary, in cases where operations turn out fatally, to make the Surgeon responsible only for the immediate, and Nature for all the remoter conse- quences. The practice, however, is founded neither in justice nor candour. It is fortunate when the Surgeon is able to prove, that, had she been entirely left to herself, the event might have proved equally adverse. She cannot be held responsible for eon- sequences immediate or remote, that arise entirely from a situation into which she is driven by compul- satory force, and in which she is obliged to act from necessity. Mr. Cooper of Guy’s hospital, to whom Surgery has been much indebted, has, with a view to illus- trate farther the effects of ligature upon large Ar- teries, made a number of new and very interesting experiments on dogs; and, in one of these, tied the Abdominal part of the Aorta, and shown that its functions may be performed by communicating branches, and the trunk obliterated only to a small distance from the ligature (.S'). He had also a view, in these experiments, to ascertain, whether or not, in tying a number of the larger Arteries, and making their blood to flow through numerous and minute (») Medico Chirurgical Transactions for 181“?.

A DESCRIPTION OF THE AnTEniES. 2t)5 O 4 and which, from its course along the side of the Fibula or Perone, has been termed Peroneal (r). The Peroneal is at first concealed under the I' lexor Pollicis Longus, sends off several perforating branch- es that pass through the Ligament to the Rotular aspect, and at last a branch, larger than the rest, (r) “ Peronea,” says Haller, “ Peronea plerumque minor, “ nonnunquam aut cequalis, aut potuis major quam Tibialis “ Posterior, aliquando nulla fait, ut ejus loco ramus esset “ ex Tibiali Postioa infra Popliteum ortus, descendens cum “ Flexoi'e communi Digitorum, et in ima ipsa epipbysi Tibia' “ anastomosin liabens cum Trunco Afteriss Tibialis.”—Fabric. V. p. 37. This language would seem to imply, that he did not consider the Peroneal so much a branch of the Posterior Tibial, as a separate Trunk from the Femoro-Popliteal Portion of the C? oral; and accordingly he observes in another place, “ Tibialis Postica plerumque inter tres Truncos Arterise Popli- “ tea maxima est.”—Fascic. V. p. 35. If the Peroneal were a regular branch, and if it rose generally near the Distal margin of the Po'pliteus, it would render the analogy between the Ar- teries of the Leg and the Fore-arm still more striking. The Crural Artery might then, like the Brachial, be said to divide nto three branches, the Tibialis Antica, Tibialis Postica, and the Peronea: the first corresponding to the Radial Artery, and generally the first branch of the three ; the Tibialis Postica to the Ulnar Artery, and generally terminating the Crural Artery with the Peronea, that corresponds to the Interosseal branch of the Fore-arm. So far as I have beea able to leam from my own observations, or from the observations of others, the Cru- ral Artery, though lifcc the Brachial exceedingly diversified in ramification, (Haller, Fascic. V■ p. 3, 4.) is more steady as to

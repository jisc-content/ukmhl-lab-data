235 A DESCRIPTION OF T1IE ARTERIES. branches that run inesiad to inosculate with branches from the Epigastric, Mr. Burns has seen one ex- tending in a line between the highest of the two Anterior Spinous Processes and the Umbilicus ; and of such a size, as almost to annihilate the other branch that accompanies the crest of the Os Ilium. This branch, he observes, would certainly be in dan- ger in performing what is called Paracentesis, be- tween the Umbilicus and the highest Anterior Spine of the Ilium. The trunk itself is subject to varieties in propor- tional magnitude. I write at present from verbal report, and from the authority of what I conceived an accurate drawing by the gentleman who observed it. In that drawing, the Artery, between the Crest and the Ribs, was nearly as large as it is usually at its commencement. Sometimes, too, this Artery is assisted by another branch, either from the Femoral, or Deep Femoral, obsei zing nearly a similar course, and very nearly of similar extent, but running superficially beneath the Integuments (z).

A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. 263 o 3 •f blood from the Plexus, and the principal share from the perforating branches. Before this Tibialis enters the Planta, between the Metatarsals of the Great Toe and the Index Pedis, like the Radial Artery on passing to the Vola between the Metacarpal bones of the Thumb and the Index Manus, it sends off a branch that afterwards divides into a Digito-Fibular of the Great Toe, and a Digito-Tibial branch of the Index. “ In many subjects,” says Mr. Burns in a let- ter, “ I find the Anterior Tibial exhausted before it reaches the Tarsus." In one case, I perceived it obliterated at the Distal extremity of the Tibia and Fibula, but appearing as usual upon the Tarsus with several of the lateral branches enlarged. It is not improbable that pressure from the shoe, or from other causes, may frequently impede the functions of this Artery and of its branches, where they run upon the Tarsus, and occasion appearances that did not belong to the original and natural formation. In the letter to which I have just now alluded, Mr. Burns adds, “ In two subjects I found the An- terior Tibial wanting. Its place was supplied by perforating twigs from the Posterior Tibial Artery. The Arteria Pcronea Antica supplied its place on the Dorsum of the Foot.” In leaving the Popliteal for the Rotular aspect, this Tibial Artery docs not always pass at the Distal

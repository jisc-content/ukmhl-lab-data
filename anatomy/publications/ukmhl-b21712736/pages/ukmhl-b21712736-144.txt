WO A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. extent of ramification : Some of them branch on the Axillary Plexus, and the neighbouring muscles, some on the deep and superficial parts of the Neck, some on the Clavicle, the Scapula, the Trapezius, and the parts adjacent. Two or more of them have received names (/*), m allusion to the direction of their course, them relative situation, or their destination ; but scarcely do those of any situation, course, or destination, ad- mit of the same uniform description in two indi- duals. Attempts to describe them by some specific and permanent characters have frequently been made, and as frequently have failed. The most accurate account of them seems to be, that the whole of the Neck is not supplied by the regular branches of the Pericephalics, nor the regular branches from the Subclavian Portions of the Brachials; but that se- veral branches, directly or indirectly, from the Sub- clavian Portions of the Brachials, having no fixed or specific characters, are always ramified on the (h) Soemmerring has named one of these, Arteria Scapular* Superior, vel Transversa, vel Cervical* Superficial^, from be,n~ both a Cervical and a Scapular branch , and Murray describes a Transverse Scapular, which, in different individuals, varies the extent of its ramifications, and sometimes, changing the direc- bonof its course, turns a Dorso-scapular; but in no situation, and under no name, does it ever restrict itself to any regular or determinate laws, as to either the mode, the number, or ex- lent of its ramifications.

When they extend, as they sometimes s are observed to do, in the Foetus, ntlantad as far as the Thyroid Glands, or sacrad nearly as far as the Diaphragm (z), they are naturally supplied with Arterial branches from various sources; and Haller has seen them receiving brandies, not only from the Arteries already named (a), but from the Ence- phalics, or Internal Carotids, and from the Atlantal,, or Superior Thyroids (6).

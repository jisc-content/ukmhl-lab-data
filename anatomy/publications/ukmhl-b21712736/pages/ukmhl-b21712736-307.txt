A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. 249 branches in the space between the crest of the Ilium and the Trochanter, to the Iliacus, the Rectus, Sarto- rius, and the Tensor Vaginae ; to the Gluteus Medius ; sometimes to the Gluteus Parvus and Magnus; and beyond the Trochanter to the Vastus Externus. On the Glutei, it inosculates with branches from the Gluteal; near the Trochanter, with extreme branches from the Larger Circumflex, and with perforating branches from the Profunda. To the Transverse branch follows a series of smaller branches running distad and Jibulad to the Vastus Externus ; the last inosculating with Articular branches near the Pa- tella, and the preceding, by minuter Ramuli, with Circumflex branches from the Profunda. When this, which is called the Transverse branch, is found to be a large division of the Trunk, the Trunk is named the descending branch. In rare cases, this Transverse branch arises from the Crural with the Larger Circumflex, while what is here denominated the Trunk, arises at a distance from the Profunda. PROPUNDA FEMORIS, Very seldom rises within the Pelvis, often gives off one or both of the Circumflex Arteries, sometimes a Pudic, very seldom the Epigastric, or a branch

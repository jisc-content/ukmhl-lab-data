A description of the arteries. the course of the Trunk, extends nearly in the ge- nera! direction of the Sacral or Inferior Costa of the Scapula, and after sending off a number of branches to the parts adjacent, is usually seen reflected at- lantad towards the base, and observed to inosculate with some transverse Cervical branches from the Subclavian Portion of the Brachial. The Circumflex Scapular, still more regular in its appearance, is reflected over the edge of the Scapula; after passing the long head of the Triceps, and run- ning underneath the Teres Minor and the Infra- spinatus, is ramified copiously on these muscles; while in all the cases, where anatomists hitherto have accurately traced its ramifications, it inosculates freely under the Acromion with that branch of the Subclavian that is named Superspinal. ARTERI* CIRCUMFLEX*. One of these Arteries is named the Anterior, and the other the Posterior, not with a reference to the aspects of the Humerus, but to those of the Thorax. They would be better named the Thenal and Anconal; however, taking the names as they are, the smaller of the two, named the An- terior, between the insertion of the Pectoral muscle and the Capsular Ligament, runs round by the Thenal aspect of the Humerus, to-the groove that re- ceives the tendon of the Biceps. In this course, it

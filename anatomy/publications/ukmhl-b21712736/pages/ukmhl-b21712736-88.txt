A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. 30 Buccal Branch. The branch called the Buccal frequently extends its ramifications through the Buccinator to the angle of the mouth (c) ; while the branch called the Alveo- lar (d) is ramified on the Gums, the Alveolar pro- cesses, the Tuber, the Antre, and the Teeth.

(d) Like the Buccal, very irregular in size and origin, the Alveolar is sometimes a primary, and sometimes only a secondary branch of the Orbitomaxillary. It is the trunk, however, of the Artery which Haller has dignified with the name of Denlalis Maxilla: Superioris. Earn Dentalem, says lie, in junioribus prosecutus sum. In general, a great num- ber of small Ramuli are seen entering the Tuber and Alveo- lar processes, but seldom any branch, very distinguish- able from the rest in magnitude, particularly in adults. The first person who minutely described the Orbitomaxillary Ar- tery, was Haller, in 1145. The description which he then gave, is with little variation to be found in most of the Systems of Anatomy published since his time. But unfortunately the Artery has not been found so regularly uniform as the de- scription; most individuals presenting varieties with respect to the manner and order in which the different branches ongi- nate, with respect also to their relative magnitudes, and the extent of their ramifications.

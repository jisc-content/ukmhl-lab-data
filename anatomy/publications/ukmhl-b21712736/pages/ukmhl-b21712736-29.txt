\ INTRODUCTION. In most animals there are two distinct classes of organs, which, from the peculiar nature of their innctions, require always to be branched or ramified : The organs through which the fluids are circulated; and the organs by which the vital Energy is diffused. The first class is divided into Arteries, Veins, and Absorbents, and each division being dignified in Anatomy, with the name of System, we have thus four ramified Systems in the human body,—the Ar- terial, the V enous, the Absorbent, and the Nervous. The Arterial system consists of the vessels which convey the blood from the ventricles of the heart; the Venous, of the vessels which return the red part; the Absorbent, of the vessels which transmit the remainder along with the decayed parts from the or- - gans, and along with the nutritious portion of the food from the alimentary canal. The Nervous sys- tem consists of the Cerebrum, the Cerebellum, the Medulla oblongata, the Spinal marrow, and their ra- mifications, the last of which are the only parts of this system strictly called nerves. . huts ® ■ r.* ::</

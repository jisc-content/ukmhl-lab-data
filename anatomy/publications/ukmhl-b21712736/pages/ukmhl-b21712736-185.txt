With respect to the- Arteries that are named Digital, though unsteady in their origin, they are generally regular as to their course, as well as to the place and mode in which they terminate; being very limited in their lateral range, they are always to be found running on the Radial and Ulnar sides of the Flexor Tendons, and regularly occupying that very space, where they are least exposed to the ac- cidents that might have a tendency to injure their structure, or impede their functions.

76 A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. runs, combine in performing the same kind of mo- tions. Had it arisen from the straight portion of the Aorta, it must have returned at a more acute angle, than any other of all the Intercostals ; and although it be true, that even human sagacity itself could have devised different means by which such inconve- niencies might be obviated, it is equally true, that no sagacity could have devised a course more secure, or an origin less exceptionable, than that which this Artery usually has from the Subclavian Portion of the Brachial (p). With respect to its mode of ramification, it is similar to that of the other Inter- costals, which shall afterwards be described in their proper place. (p) Haller saw it rising by a common trunk with the Cer- vical Artery, and also by a common trunk with the Sacrothy- roidj Eschenbach, by a common trunk with the Vertebral Artery; Ravius, by a common trunk with the Sternal, or In- ternal Mammary Artery. Winslow and Walter saw two Inter- costals on the same side from the Brachial Artery, and P. C. Fabricius saw a case, where all the Intercostals were from the Aorta. See Haller, Fascic. viii. p. 64.

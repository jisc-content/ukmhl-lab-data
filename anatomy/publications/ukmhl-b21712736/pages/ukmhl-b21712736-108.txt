A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. oO and are regularly seen accompanying the folds of the Pia Mater into the Sulci. From the Pia Mater, their Ramuli penetrate the Cerebral substance; but excepting a few that con- vey red blood, are no longer to be traced by the eye. Arteria Callosa„ This Artery, in the progress of the course already described, sends branches to the Optic and Olfactory nerves; a communicating branch or two to its fel- low of the opposite side (g) ; branches to the Basilar aspect of the anterior Lobe, the Coronal aspect of the (</) “ Vidi,” says Haller, “ Vidi aliquoties anteriorem Car- “ tidis Ramum dextrum, in Cerebrum ejusque lobum anterio- “ rem ivisse. Cum interim sinister solus, duas corporis Cal- “ losi Arterias generaret, qua: solito more ejus longitudinem “ retrorsum relegerunt.” This exception from the general rule, is similar to the one to which I allude, where I say, that the two Arteriee Callosae sometimes unite in a common trunk. The preparation, in my collection, exhibits the right Arteria Callosa dividing into two unequal branches; the smallest is confined in its ramifications to the base of the right anterior lobe, the larger of the two bends sinistrad, unites with the left Arteria Callosa, which is suddenly enlarged in its diameter, and afterwards divided into two branches of an equal magni- tude, which two branches, connected with the brain, were seen reflected iniad and coroiiad, and occupying the place of the two Callosaa on the mesial aspect of the opposite hemispheres. Of the first two branches, the largest, which is seen bending sinistrad to unite with the left Arteria Callosa, is nearly iu th*

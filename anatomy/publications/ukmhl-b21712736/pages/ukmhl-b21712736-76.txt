A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. IS the two Recti Capitis intern i, the Longus Colli, the Eustachian Tube, sometimes to the Tympanum, the Sphenoidal bone, the Pterygoid canal, and to the inial part of the nostrils, to the muscles belonging to the Pendulous velum, to the Tonsils and Uvula, later ad to the ganglion of the great Intercostal, to the Par vagum, and ninth pair of nerves, sometimes even to the Sternomastoideus, and conglobate glands, while a branch accompanying the Jugular vein ascends into the Cranium, and is afterwards ramified on the Dura Mater, extending occasionally to the Cavernous Sinuses. ARTERIA LABIALIS (r) Appearing first by the side of the Pharynx, under the Biventer and Stylohyoideus,'it immediately pro- (r) Named also the Facial, the Angular, and External Maxillary. Sabatier has seen it rising in c ommon with the Pharyngeal. It also has been seen rising in common with the Lingual Artery. Haller saw it terminating sometimes in the Coronary Artery of the Basilar Lip; and, at other times, ex- tending as far as the orbits and musmlus frontalis. Mr. Burnt has seen it also terminating at the Basilar Lip. But, “ raro “ Labin non adit,” says Haller. Where its branches are de- fective, their place is supplied by ramifications from the. Temporal Artery. To the many varieties of this Artery, men- tioned in the notes to his third Fasciculus, Haller has added a great many more in the notes which accompany his eight Fasciculus.

Submental Branch. One of these branches rising in the seat of the Maxillary Gland, is often so large that it has re- ceived an appropriate name, and been called the Submental or Submaxillary Artery. It runs peri- pherad of the Mylohyoideus, between the Biventer and the Maxilla, and cenirad of the Latissimus Colli. It usually divides at the lateral margin of the Biventer, near the Symphysis Menti, into two branches, one of these proceeding mesiad across the Biventer, and the other reflected over the Jaw. When it is large, the size of the Sublingual is pro- portionally small, and vice versa. When it arises from the Pericephalic, as it sometimes does, it sends off the greatest number of the branches that are co A similar branch sometimes rises from the Pericephalic, but raro carotidis ramus, boemmerring.

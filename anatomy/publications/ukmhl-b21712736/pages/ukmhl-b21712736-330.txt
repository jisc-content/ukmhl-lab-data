272 A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. inosculate in their course by Transverse branches, „ and' like the Digital branches of the hand, terminate at last in Digital Arches. Near the Metatarsal of the Great Toe, where it unites with the Anterior Tibial Artery, it increases its diameter, and generally sends off the Plantar branch that afterwards divides into the Digito-Ti- bial of the Index Pedis, and the Digito-Fibular of the Great Toe. With respect to the Digito-Tibial branch of the Great Toe, it is sometimes wanting • has sometimes its place supplied by a Plexus; at times is a branch of the Anterior Tibial Artery before the anastomsis is formed ; and at times a division of the Plantar branch, from which the other two Di- gitals arise. The other branches from the Plantar Arch, are those which correspond in their general character to what Haller has denominated, in treat- ing of the Hand, Volar Interosseals, Volar Per- forates, and Retrograde Volars. And here termi- nate the Ramifications of the Aorta.

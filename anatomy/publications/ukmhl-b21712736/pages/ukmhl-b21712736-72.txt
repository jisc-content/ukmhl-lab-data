A DESCRIPTION OP THE ARTERIES. 14 minates in the Thyroid Gland, where some of it* branches, crossing the Trachea, inosculate with their fellows of the opposite side, and others continuing on the same side, inosculate with branches of the Sacro- thyroid, from the Brachial Artery. The adjacent parts to which it sends branches, are the Os Hyoides, the Ligament between it and the Thyroid Cartilage, the muscles of the Larynx, the Thyropharyngeus, the Cricopharyngeus, the Thyro- hyoideus, the Sternothyroideus, the Omohyoideus, the Stcrnomastoideus the Latisssimus Colli, and the Cutis Its Laryngeal Branch (?Â«). Its branch supplying the muscles of the Larynx, is named the Laryngeal. It penetrates the membranes gin of the Thyrohyo.deus, crossed the cormi of the Os hyoides, and before entering the substance of the tongue, sent off the ascending Palatine branch. Haller saw it sending a branch to the Thymic Gland. He saw it in the Foetus and in the adult not inferior in size to the Encephalic, and he saw it equal in size to the rest of the Pericephalic, wheu he scarcely could observe any appearance of an Inferior or Sacrothyroid. He saw it extremely small on one side, and so large on the other, that it principally supplied both lobes of the Gland. And he oftener than once saw it sending off a Subcutaneous branch, that run on the sternal aspect of the neck, as far as the Thorax, and inosculated with branches from the Mammary Artery. See Fascic. u and vm. (m) Five times out of fifty, or in the proportion of one to ten, H aller observed this branch rising as a separate trunk from the

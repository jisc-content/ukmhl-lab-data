228 A description of tiie arteries. branches, he could affect the habits of the animal, and render them somewhat similar to those of the Lemur Tardigradus, and other animals of slow mo- tion, in which Mr. Carlisle had regularly observed the blood of the extremities circulating through nu- merous and minute vessels. But such an effect could have been expected, only at the time when the la- teral vessels were imperfectly performing their new kind of duty, not after they were capable of fur- nishing the parts with as liberal a supply, as they had been accustomed to receive from the trunk. W hatever it be that organizes the animal or vege- table, it appears always to operate on a plan pre- scribed to its species, and, with change of circum- stances, has always a power of more or less limited extent, to modify its organs, for the regular exercise of those functions that characterize and distinguish its species. Had the minute divisions of the Ar- teries, observed by Mr. Carlisle, been destroyed by ligature, and new Arteries succeeded to the office, it is reasonable to infer, on the principles of analogy, that the new Arteries would have performed the same kind of duty that had been performed by the original ramifications. I have always considered these observations of Mr. Carlisle on slow moving animals, and Willisâ€™ re- marks on the Rete Mirabile, as highly important. 1 hey diiect the attention of the Anatomist to a scries

5S A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. ARTERIA BRAC-HIALIS. This Artery, as already defined, is the vessel ramified upon the Atlantal or superior extremity. On the right side, it generally rises with the Cepha- lic from the Arteria Innominata. On the left from the arch of the Aorta itself. Between its origin, and where it emerges from under the Clavicle to the Axilla, it is known by the name of Subclavian (s) Artery. From the Clavicle, till it leaves the cup of the Axilla, or passes the tendons of the Pectoralis and Latissimus Dorsi, it is called the Axillary Ar- tery ; and from the Axilla to the bend of the arm, the Humeral Artery, and often the Brachial. No Artery in the human body is ramified on parts that exhibit such varieties of voluntary motions, and no Artery, perhaps, in the body presents such diver- sities of ramification. Haller examined it in twenty- eight bodies, and though he saw not all its branches,, yet he saw enough to make him despair of ascer- taining, in particular places, what was its common (t) The term Subclavian can be used only in an arbitrary sense in those numerous species of quadrupeds that are desti- tute of Clavicles; in these the Artery, almost immediately after its origin, becomes Axillary.

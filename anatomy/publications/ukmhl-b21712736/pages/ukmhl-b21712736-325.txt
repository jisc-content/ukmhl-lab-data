A description of the arteries. 2()7 When a Peroneal, and the two Tibial Arteries are present, the Peroneal, through the medium of its branches, inosculates with both; with the one rotulad, with the other poplitead of the Fibular Ancle ; if it be large, inosculates also conspicuously with both upon the Fibular side of the Tarsus ; with lateral branches from the Anterior ; and with the External Plantar branch, that seems in general to be the continued Trunk of the Posterior. Among these inosculating branches, one is particularly distinguish- ed by its size, the regularity of its presence, and its steadiness of position; it is seen poplitead, near to the junction of the Tibia and Fibula, and extending transversely between the Peroneal and Posterior Ti- bial. Haller, who observed these inosculations, and trusted only to those that were conspicuous, remarks, that even in consequence of two, which he has men- tioned, the Posterior Tibial might be tied without danger (/). Amidst the great variety of branches which the Posterior Tibial gives out in the progress of its (/) “ Uae duae anastomoses adeo magnae sunt, ut nullum du- “ bium supersit, posse Avteriam Tibialem, absque ullo peri- “ culo gangrenae, ligari ct dcstrui, ut solet cum radiali fieri. “ Aliae etiarn tamen sunt, neque ese minima; uniones inter hunc “ ramum Peronea et posticam Tibialem ante Achillis tendinem, “ ut minores et reticulatas omittam, quae retro eum tendinem, “ cum surculis Tibialibus coeunt, cuti propiores.”—Fascic.

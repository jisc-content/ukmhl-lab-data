A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. §7 that tins Artery, at its commencement, must be near tiie Meatus Auditorius Externus, the Articular de- pression in the Temporal bone, and Masseter muscle ; that running on the central aspect of the Maxillary Ramus, it must pass near the Temporal muscle and the two-Pterygoids; near the canal in the Basilar Maxilla, the Foramen Spinosum, and Foramen Ovale of the Os Sphenoides, the Buccinator, the Maxillary Tuber, the Pterygopalatine canal, the Sphenopalatine hole, and when bending antimad through the canal in the bottom of the Orbit, must pass along the Coronal part of the Maxillary Antre. From this previous knowledge of the situation, he will naturally anticipate most of the parts on which it is ramified, requiring only to be further informed with respect to the manner and extent of the ramifi- cation of particular branches. That information I shall try to convey in the following description. • A ®amulus of branch, distributed upon the Articular depression, has been seen passing through the fissure of Glasserus, entering the Tympanum, and inosculating with Ramuli of the Stylomastoid. The branches sent to the Temporal muscle are generally two a„d are observed to run close the bone, from which the fibres of the muscle originate thTo^ I ?rbi* b™,ehe to the Oibit and Lacrymal Gland.

In short, the blood vessels, to a certain extent, ac- commodate themselves to changes of circumstances, enlarge, diminish, and even disappear according to the different exigences pf the case. This general truth, deduced from the facts that already have been mentioned, is farther confirmed by the states of the vessels in morbid structures, by the changes that follow ancurismal tumours, by the changes that fol- low the removal of these tumours in successful ope- rations, and also from, the greater number of varie- ties to be seen in the parts which are naturally sub- jected to the greatest diversity of voluntary motion. From this account we may partly see the cause why no Arteries have ever yet been characterized by the number of their branches, some deriving a name from their origin, as the External and Internal Caro- this, and Aortic Inlcrcostals ; some from the organs on which they are ramified, as the Hepatic, the Gas- tric, the Splenic ; some from their situation, as the Humeral, Radial, and Ulnar; some from the parts through which they pass, as the Obturator; some from their mode of passing, as the Perforant; some from the directions which they take, as the Rccui- rent; some from the course of their direction, as the Circumflex; some from their course considered in relation to the parts on which they run, as the Coro- nary ; some from their obvious inosculations, as the

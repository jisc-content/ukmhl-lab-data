277 A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. Lungs should be deemed essential in promoting the circulation of the blood. He clearly proved, that it was not necessary in promoting that function in the animal temperature, was never at any time generally received. His other notion, that respiration was principally intended for transmitting Oxygen or the Nitrum Aereum into the system, has not only been general, but prevalent till lately; and hence the irritability of the muscular fibre, the processes of vitality, and consequently all the functions of the system, have for a while been made to depend upon the Oxidation, the Arteria- lization, or Oxygenation of the Sanguineous fluid. Again, it would appear from the numerous experiments of Mr. Ellis, that respiration contributes to support animal temperature, not by furnishing additional Oxygen, but by removing the excess of Carbon. Hippocrates and Galen, who supposed the existence of an tupjrst Ylvp, or Calor Nativus residing in the heart, imagined tiiat respiration was intended to supply it regularly with fresh and cool air to give it ventilation, and remove from around it the fuliginous vapours, with which it might otherwise have been extinguished. The learned Laurentius, who agrees here with Hippocrates and Galen, that the primary intention of respiration is to preserve the Calor Nativus, “ Est itaque pri- “ mus, hie respirationis usus. Conservatio caloris cordis, qu® “ fit reftigeratione etexpurgatione,” {Lib. ix. Quest, texix. Hist. Anal.) is also of opinion, that respiration rather takes from the blood than gives any thing to it, and accordingly observes, that the exspiration is more essential than the inspiration: “ Respondeo inspirare ut exspirent, Adest necessitas exspi- “ rationis ob copiam fuliginis non inspirationis.”—Ibid. Cicero, who did not think of applying his notion of heat to illustrate the nature of animal temperature, had an idea that

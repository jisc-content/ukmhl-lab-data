150 A DESCRIPTION Of THE ARTERIES. Of the numerous branches that pass, peripherad, through the Costal interstices., to be ramified upon the incumbent muscles, there is only one which Haller has chosen to distinguish by a name. It is called the Dorsal, from the situation where it pene- •* dorsi se penetrantem, spinalemque medullam, et Intercos- “ talem gui continu iterum divisus duobus paraltelis truncis Cos- “ tarum suarum oras teg it—Fascic. vHi. p. 65. The words here printed in Italics, have been interpreted different ways: Mur- ray has supposed that the two branches coasted along the oppo* site margins of the same rib, and has therefore described the Su- perior or Atlantal as the smaller division of the common Trunk. Others have supposed that the two branches run along the margins of neighbouring ribs, situated on the opposite sides of the interstice, and therefore describe the inferior branch as the smaller division of the common Trunk; the last is the meaning which the words of Haller were intended to convey. “ Ramus,'' he says, “ Ramus Intercostalis tegitur. Pectus “ versus, musculis ejus nominis internis. Ad exiguam a “ Costae capitulo distantiam, paulo serius ocyusve dividitur “in duos ramos. Kamus inferior a quarta Intercostali “ deorsum minus constanter, et nonnunquam perexiguus est, “ et fere absque ramis, praeter eos qui Costae Membranas “ pulchre pererrant, et similibus ramis occurrunt, a superiori “ natis, turn eos qui musculis lutercostalibus prospiciunt.—— “ Saepius Inferior Trunculus, ahoquin minor, in superiorem, “ adscendit, et ipsi immitittur ueque alium finem habet”— Fascic. oiii. p. 66. , Ruysch, who admits the inferior branch towards the Sternal extremity of the Ribs, and between the Cartilages, thinks that

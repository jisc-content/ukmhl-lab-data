A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. 107 and fore-arm (tv). It rises generally from the Hu- meral Portion of the Brachial Artery, near its com- has been denominated Ulnar Profunda, is a branch either from the Humeral or Profunda, that happens to inosculate with an Ulnar recurrent. In the language of Soemmerring, “ a Ramus “ Ulnaris sive Cubitalis couimunicans sive Collateralis L’lnaris “ sive Ramus Inferior.” The term Inferior bearing an allusion to some other branch of a like kind that he calls Superior. From an idea that the Profunda runs somewhat parallel to the Humeral Artery, it has been named the Collateral Artery, the Great Collateral, the Superior Collateral, the External Col- lateral. The Great Collateral, with a reference to a smaller Artery or Arteries, thought Collateral also; the Superior Col- lateral, with a reference to the same, as arising after it; and the External Collateral, from its extending to the Radial or Ex- ternal side, in contradistinction to the small Collaterals, which continue on the Ulnar or Internal side. When two small Collaterals are described, the Great Collateral is then the Superior and External Collateral, to distinguish it from the first of the small Collaterals, which is the Superior and Internal; Superior, with respect to its fellow beyond it, and Internal, with respect to the Great Collateral that extends its course to the Radial aspect Une of these small Internal Collaterals, is what some denominate the Ulnar Profunda. It may fairly be questioned, whether Anatomists, in describing these Arteries, were ever surpassed by the builders of Babel, in their con- fusion of language and ideas ?

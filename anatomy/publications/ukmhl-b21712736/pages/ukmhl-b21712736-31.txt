INTRODUCTION'. b 2 i lie \ enous trunks, by which the blood upon its leturn enters the auricles, are seven in number. 1 he venous branches, receiving blood from the bran- ches of the pulmonic artery, terminate in four ; these tiansmit their blood to the left or systemic auricle; the left or systemic auricle, to the left or systemic ventricle; and the left or systemic ventricle, to the Aorta or systemic artery. The venous branches, receiving blood from the branches of the Aorta or systemic artery, terminate in three, the cava superior, the cava inferior, and coronary vein. These transmit their blood to the right or pulmonic auricle, the right or pulmonic auricle to the right or pulmonic ventricle, and the right or pul- monic ventricle to the pulmonic artery, where, in flow- ing through the smaller ramifications, it is exposed to the action of the air, changes its colour, again en- ters the systemic veins, and again returns by the sys- temic auricle and ventricle into the aorta or systemic artery. While in this artery, as it passes through t e branches, it gradually loses the florid red hue, but returning again by the pulmonic veins, auricle,' ventricle, and pulmonic artery, recovers it in the lungs. Prior to the time of Harvey, all the blood vessels connected with the right or pulmonic ventricle were considered as veins, and hence, in those days, the

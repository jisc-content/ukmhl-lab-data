Yet, notwithstanding the greater regularity of all the larger ramifications in the animal kingdom, every individual exhibits many peculiar varieties in the smaller branches, and even in some of the larger branches, where parts are diseased, or where habits are formed of varied extensive and voluntary motions. Such varieties, in copying from nature, are often re- presented in Anatomical Engravings, and referen- ces, often made indiscriminately, to the varieties as well as to the common ramifications. These Engrav- ings, again, if works of celebrity, are often, along with their verbal descriptions, and with very little change, copied by others, while these copies, passing for ori- ginals with the young and unsuspicious, the conclu- sion is, that branchings described by so many Anato- mists in different countries, and at different periods, must be branchings, if not universally present, at least very general among the species. On this hypothesis, and with a persuasion that appearances observed, and with little variation in every individual, must be matters of importance, and among tlie essential characters of the species, the student proceeds to examine them with care, and.

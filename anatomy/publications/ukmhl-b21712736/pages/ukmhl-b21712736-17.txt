XI PREFACE. ous copies of inferior size, execution, and price, and partly copies, and partly not, to conceal the plagiarisms («), have frequently been published, and frequently been thought equally useful. Among these some, with a few original figures, have been delineated by Anatomists themselves, who in that case cannot be supposed to feel much interest in bringing into view, or in commending any thing greatly superior to their own. From these causes, as well as from the price (6), the splendid engravings that reflected honour upon the judgment and superintendence of former Ana- (а) “ Hine factum ut scioli multi et sophist®, aliorum in- “ venta expilantes, eadem passim (ordine solummodo verbis- “ que immutatis, paucisque nullius momenti adjectis) pro suis “ audacter venditent; philosophiamque, quam certain et per- 11 spicuam esse oportuit, obscuram intrieatam etconfusam red- “ dant.”—Harveius, Prafat. ad Exercit de Generat. Animalium. (б) The high price of elegant engravings is the usual pre- tence for publishing those of inferior value. In this pretence, the Anatomist is supposed to have little taste for the line arts, to be either needy or meanly parsimonious, and yet not so fet- tered the one way or the other, as to refuse a little of his money for figures accommodated to his wants, if poor, or his nig- gardliness, if sordid. He is not, indeed, openly discouraged from having recourse to the structure itself, which these figures are meant to represent, but is confidently assured, that, by the assistance of such figures, he will greatly facilitate the progress of his studies at a small expense ; a hint which, if taken, must be gratifying at least to the author and bookseller, whether advantageous to him or not.

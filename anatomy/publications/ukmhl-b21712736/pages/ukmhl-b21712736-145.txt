A DESCRIPTION OP THE A&TERIE3. g7 different aspects of the Cervical region; some of them meeting with branches proceeding from the Pericephalics towards the Atlantal part of the Neck; some of them, towards the Scapula and Clavicle, in- osculating with branches from the Axilla; and one of them, particularly an Anastomotic, of a large size named *Superspinal, passing under or above the Ligament of the Scapular Notch, and always inos- culating, under the Acromion, with a branch re- flected from the Subscapular. Some of them are seen occasionally arising by a common trunk, with the Vertebral Artery, the first Intercostal, or the Sternal Artery; although most com- monly, when they rise not directly from the Brachial itself, they are seen rising by a common trunk with the Sacrothyroid. Hence Anatomists, since the days of Haller, have been puzzling themselves, and confounding their readers, by sedulously detailing the many varieties, and the many combinations of the Sacrothyroid, of which they have read, of which they have heard, or which they may have seen ; and it is not improbable, that future Anatomists of the like genius, temper, and industry, will, in searching for novelties, describe many more that have not yet been entered on record. When the common trunk, that furnishes the whole, or a number of these branches, is once considered as the Sacrothyroid, we need hardly be surprised to

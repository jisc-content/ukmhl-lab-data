A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. 6 ARTERI.E CARDIACS, seu Coronarice Cordis. (g) These Arteries arise from the Aorta within the Pericardium, generally beyond the Sinuses of Mor- gagni ; the right runs dextrad between the Pulmonic Auricle and Ventricle, until it reaches the Cardiac Septum on the dorsal aspect, then changes its course, and accompanies the Septum as far as the Apex. The left runs sinistrad between the Systemic Auricle and Ventricle, till it reaches the Septum on the sternal aspect, there it sends off a branch, continuing the line of its first direction, but passes itself along the Septum, and inosculates with the right Cardiac at the Apex. These two Arteries, by their numerous branches, supply the two Ventricles, the two Auricles, and the (g) Three Cardiac Arteries are rare, and those cases where but one has occurred, though such have been mentioned by Galen and others, were never seen by Haller. 1 have lately seen a case, where the right Cardiac did not reach dextrad so far as the Septum, and where the circumflex branch of the left Cardiac, of an uncommonly large size, was observed going round to supply its place,

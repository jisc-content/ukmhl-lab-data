A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. 15 between the Os Hyoidcs, and the Thyroid Cartilage, is afterwards ramified upon the Membrane lining the Larynx, on the Epiglottis, on the Cartilages, and on half of the muscles attached to the two Aryta-noid Cartilages', and in places where its ramuli approach the Mesial Plane, they inosculate with the ramuli of the opposite Thyroid. ARTERIA LINGUALIS (w) Runs at first sternad and mesiad, then ailantad and mesiad, and then sternad and mesiad again, to the Apex of the tongue. In this course, com- mencing close b}’ the side of the Pharynx, and run- ning ailantad of the Os Hyoides, peripherad, or ceulrad of the Hyoglossus, it always penetrates the Pericephalic, accompanied, as it generally or always is, by the Laryngeal nerve. It has also been seen perforating the Thyroid Cartilage, and, according to Murray, sometimes entering be- tween the Thyroid and the Cricoid Cartilages. The central parts of the Larynx are principally supplied by it and its fellow, the branches from the Sacrothyroid that enter the Larynx, being in general so smajl, that some mention them, as Boyer, and others omit them, as Bichat’s Continuator, and Sabatier. (n) Seven times in fifty, Haller observed this Artery rising by a common trunk with the Labial.

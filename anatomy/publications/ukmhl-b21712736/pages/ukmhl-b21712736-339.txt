A description of the arteries. 281 to preserve the blood, or the circulating fluid, in that state which fits it for entering into those processes in which heat is evolved, and the internal tempera- ture supported. Without temperature, internal or external, no pro- cess in either the formation, or the preservation of animal or vegetable, has been ever carried on. Plants and animals are not reduced to the torpid state in the end of Autumn from deficiency of Oxygen, or excess of Carbon, but from want of temperature. Nor are they revived again in the Spring from any additional supply of Oxygen, or discharge of Carbon, but an increase of temperature. A requisite temperature must precede every process in which heat is either evolved or absorbed ; and if the processes, in which it is evolved, appear in their turn supporting the temperature, it is like the offspring supporting the parent, or like the offspring which, first being ge- nerated, generates in its turn. In short, it may be said, translating almost the language of Cicero, that every thing which lives, whether plant or ani- mal, lives by the vital agency of heat (6). (b) “ Omne quod vivit, sive animal, sive terra editum, id “ vivit propter inclusum in eo Calorem. iix quo intelligi debet, “ earn Caloris naturam vim habere in se vitalem, per omnem “ mundum pertinentem.”—De Natura Dcorum, Lib. ii. Cap. ix. In another place, Cicero characterizes the heat of the fire, or external heat, and the Calor Jnclusus, or internal heat, in the following manner: “Hie noster ignis, quern usus vitae requir'd,

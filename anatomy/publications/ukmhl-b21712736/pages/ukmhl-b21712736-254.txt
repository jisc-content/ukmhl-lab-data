Whatever be their office, they are proportionally larger in the Foetus than m the Adult, and supplied by Arteries from various sources; from the Coeliac, the Aorta, the Phremcs, the Renals; sometimes from the Lumbars ; and sometimes, says So mmerring, though certainly not according to general analogy, from the Epigastrics (z). They have been ob- served on the right side sending Ramuli to the Duodenum, to the Liver, and to the Hepatic flexure of the Colon; on the left side, to the Mesocolon, the Splenic flexure of the Colon, and the Spleen (a) ; on both sides branches to the Diaphragm, and oc- casionally one of the Spermatic Arteries. As they vary their size with the size of the organ on which they are ramified, their variety and extent of rami- fication will be different at different periods of life ; so that what may seem the trunks at one period, (*) “ Interdum ex Arteria Epigastrica in uno vel utroque “ latere nascuntur;” probably some inosculating branches of the Epigastrics enlarged, and extended to the Capsulae Atra- Tpliarias.

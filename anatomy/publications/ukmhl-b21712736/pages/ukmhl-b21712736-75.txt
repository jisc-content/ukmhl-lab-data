17 A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. adjacent,. When large, its branches are continued through the Mylohyoideus, and afterwards ramified on the Biventer, the Latissimus Colli, the muscles of the Basilar Lip, and Integuments. When small, it terminates near the Symphysis Menti, but always, says Haller, is a regular branch. ARTERIA PHARYNGEA. (q) This Artery, excepting the Auricular, the smallest of all the regular branches of the Pericephalic, ascends between the Pharynx and the Rectus Capitis Internus Major to the base of the Cranium. The Anatomist who distinctly recollects its posi- tion, end the relative situations of the parts adjacent, must instantly be able to form an idea how it is ramified, and know from its magnitude, that its branches, if numerous, must also be small. These branches or ramuli fire sent to the Pharynx, and the muscles of the Pharynx atlanlad of its origin, to (q) There are rarely two, and more rarefy three Pharyngeal Arteries, though such have been seen by Haller and Soemiher- ring. When two, both Haller and Soommerring have seen one of them from the Cephalic, and one from the Encephalic. Sabatier has seen the single Pharyngeal rising in common with the Labial Artery, and Haller has seen it rising entirely from the Occipital.

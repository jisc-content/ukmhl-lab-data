From whatever source it derives its origin, it rises always a little proximdd of the joint of the elbow; rises regularly from the Ulnar side of its parent trunk ; runs, for a little, to the Ulnar aspect, then branches out in various directions, inosculating with branches from the Profunda, and with recurrent branches from the fore-arm; some of them ascending by the Thenal aspect^ and some ascending by the Anconal, between the Ulnar Condyle and Ole- cranon. It is named Ramus Anastomoticus, not as the only Anastomotic ; and Ramus Anastomoticus Magnus, not as a great Anastomotic; but consider- ing its size, and the number of its branches, because it inosculates more frequently, and on more aspects, by free and obvious communications, than any other branch usually assigned to the Humeral Portion of the Brachial Artery. When named the Anastomo- ticus Major, it is named improperly, as from this name the young Anatomist is led to expect a Ramus Anastomoticus Minor, and must be disappointed iÂ» (c) raid, and Note, page 99.

A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. 181 injection is propelled with more than ordinary force. The force which thus elongates the Artery, at the same time increases its diameter, and provides a remedy against the excess of impetus or quantity, by an additional extent of the flexures. ARTERIA MESENTERIC MAJOR, seu Superior. This Artery rises from the Sternal aspect of the Aorta, in the immediate vicinity of the Cceliac, and often so near, that Galenâ€™s description, if not care- fully examined, might seem to imply that they ge- nerally originate by a common trunk.

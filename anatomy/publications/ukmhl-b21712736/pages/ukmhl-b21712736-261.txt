203 A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. link that is of importance. After mentioning, there- fore, that the Sacral extremity is supplied entirely by one Artery, which I name the Crural, I shall de- scribe its several divisions, and their ramifications, under different heads, not as separate and distinct Arteries, as is usually done, but as different portions of the same Artery. Its first portion from the Aorta, running on the last of the Lumbar Vertebrae, to the junction of the Ilium and Os Sacrum, where it generally sends of the first large branch, I shall call the Lumbar. It is usually termed the Common Iliac Artery. Its second portion, extending from the junction of the Ilium and Sacrum, and along the Ilium, till it passes under the ligament of Poupart into the Groin, I shall name the Ii,iac, It is usually called the Ex* lernal Iliac Artery. Its third portion, where it lies in the Groin, and sends off the Inguinal pudics, if we are to admit such a division, may be termed the Inguinal. It is usual- ly denominated the Common Femoral Artery. Its fourth portion, extending from the Groin along the Tibial aspect of the Femur to the tendon of the Adductor Magnus, where it ultimately leaves the Tibial aspect, might well enough be named the Flmoro-tibial. It is generally named the Super- ficial Femoral Artery,

A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. US Tebralis (x). The other branches that are seen ramified in the vicinity, on the deep or superficial parts of the neck, running transversely towards the Scapula, or running sacrad towards the Thorax, disclaim any fixed or determinate origin, rising in one individual from the trunk, in another from one of the regular branches, but scarcely acknowledging a particular branch, or any particular place of the trunk, or any particular mode of originating more than another; and, we also may add, even the regular branches themselves show often a tendency to assume this lawless and unsettled character. (x) To these four regular Arteries, some Anatomists have add- ed a CervicaRs Profunda, or Posterior, a Cervicalts SuperficiaRs, or Transverse, and a Scapularis Superior of Haller, supposed the •ame as a Dorsalis Scapula: of Vidius, a Supra Scapularis of Ravius, or a Scapularis Externa of Heister and Winslow. Even Murray, who has made the following remark, “ Rami Subcla- “ vine horunique surculi infinite multas offerunt variationes, ut “ fere nunquam descriptiones, nec quoad ramulorum nume- “ rum, nec quoad eorum decursum, ex omni parte cum ipsa “ natura quadrent,” soon forgets his own observation, and in- stead of describing the general and specific characters of these branches, gives a minute and tedious detail of the varieties that occur in individuals.

, A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. 217 for as the Gians, to which and the Prepuce, it is Seen distributing its ultimate branches. In every part of this long and circuitous course, it is sending branches to the parts adjacent; before it leaves the cavity of the Pelvis, it is often seen giving branches to the Rectum and Urinary bladder; not unfrequently to the Seminal Vesicles, the Pros- tate Gland, the Obturator Interims, and to the Vagina, if in the female. From where it emerges to where it returns, it as- sists the Ischiadic either by increasing its usual re- sources, or supplying some occasional deficiencies. In common therefore with the Ischiadic, it sends branches to the Pyriformis, the Gluteus Magnus, the Coccyx, the Gemelli, the Ischial Tuberosity, the Biceps, Triceps, Semitendinosus, and Semimembra- nosus, where these are attached to it. If not sent by the Ischiadic, it transmits a branch along the Gemelli to the Trochanter, from whence extending its ramifications in the vicinity, it communicates with the Internal Circumflex and Obturatoria. Having passed the ligaments, it sends additional branches to the Rectum, called External Haemon** hoidals; branches to the Levator Ani, the Sphincter Ani, and the surrounding adipose substance. Run- ning sternad and atlanlad, close to the Rami of the Ischium and Pubis, along the side of the Perineum, it gives out branches to the neighbouring muscles, M 4>

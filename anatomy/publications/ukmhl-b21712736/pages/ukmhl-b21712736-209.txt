151 A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. zealous, in making a reply : He cites the passages from Erasistratus and Galen at full length; shows that their meaning is obscure and enigmatical; that Marchcttis talks only, in a general way, of two or three Arteries that spring from the Aorta to be ramified on the Lungs; and that his friend Ruysch was the first Anatomist who had accurately examined, traced, and described one. I regret that Haller should have overlooked these reasonings of Graetz; and that, in depriving Frederick Ruysch of the honour of discovery, he should also have withheld from him that credit to which he was certainly justly entitled, the credit of being the first writer who gave an authentic and accurate description of a Bronchial Artery (i). («) Ruysch’s description of the Bronchial Artery, is as fol- lows : “Hanc, Arteriam Bronchiaeem nominare visum fuit; “ supra Bronchia enitn serpens ea concomitatur ad finem “ usque. Ortum sumit ab Arteriee raagnse descendentis pos- “ tiea parte, digiti latitudine, plus minus, supra Supremas “ Arteriarum Intercostalium, ex Aorta descendenti exortarum, “ aliquando etiam duorum digitorum latitudine Supra Ar- “ terias modo dictas; nonnunquam etiam infra eas originem “ habere comperio : placet enim naturae aliquando varietate “ frui. Nunc unica exsurgit, nunc gemina, ita ut saepius, “ Arteria Magnl Cadavere exempta, Intercostalibus et Bron- “ chialibus abscissis, trunculi Bronchialium remanentes, ex- “ ortum Intercostalium mentiantur.”—Ruyschii Oper.

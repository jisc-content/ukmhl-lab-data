133 A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. the varieties which it happened to present in no fewer than six subjects, adding besides, elegant figures representing the differences of Arterial ves- sels, as occurring in the Vola of four individuals. Three of these figures to be found in his sixth, and the fourth to be found in his eighth Fasciculus. Without entering into any description, unneces- sarily minute, I shall only remark, that we cannot always observe the appearance of a regular and dis- tinct deep Volar arch, more than of a regular and distinct arch immediately under the Aponeurosis. In those cases, where the deep one appears, com- paratively speaking, to be well formed, it is some- times formed by the Radial Artery, without a com- municating Ulnar branch ; the communicating Ul- nar, in that case, inosculating only with some of its branches. At other times, the Radial Artery extends only a part of the way across the Metacai'pus, when it meets the communicating branch from the Ulnar, and when both appear to assist equally in constitut- ing the arch. This seems to be the form under which it was principally observed by Verheyen. At other times, the communicating branch from the Ulnar is so large, that it forms the greatest part of the arch, and is seen inosculating with the Radial Portion, near the Metacarpal bone of the Index. In this case, the diameter of the Trunk forming

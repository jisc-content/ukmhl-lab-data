It rises near to the origin of its Trunk, and passes outward, be- tween the Vertebrae and those Ligaments that ex- tend from Transverse process to Transverse. It is ramified on the Multifidus Spinae, the Spinalis such a branch at their Vertebral extremity is a rare occur- rence. « Varus in locis dictas Arterias Mammarias non solum trunculis sms irrigare demonstrabam inferiorem Lim- “ m CartilaglI1Um Costarum, verum etiam superiorem secus ac m spatns mterosseis, ubi rarissime si unquam, binis , trUnCUl'S S'n=U,arem ('ostam infra supraque ditari, obser- “ vavi: In alns antem objectis demonstravi quoque dictos “ trunculos intercartilagineos per solum marginem superiorem “111 allls locis’ Per inferiorem dijseminari.”—Epist. h. p. 18. What Ruysch has said here, must be understood of Inter, ostal Arteries running on the central aspect of the muscles; for Tab. „L fig. 3. of his first Thesaurus, represents Arteries running along the opposite margins of the same Rib. His language respecting them is, “ Arteri® Intercostales, exteriores a me “ d'Cte’ "°n S0lum per Costarum limbum inferiorem, verum “etiam inferiorem. reptantes.

A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. 187 the Colica Sinistra, which naturally suggests an idea of relation between it and the Colica Dextra, it must be confessed, although he has no where, so far as I know, made the remark, that the Arteries dis- tributed to the larger Intestine, exhibit a marked difference of appearance, from those distributed to the Duodenum, Jejunum, and Ileum. Whether from the larger or smaller Mesenteric, they are pro- portionally larger in size, fewer in number, diverge to greater distances in their course, form arches of a wider span, and divide later into small Ramuli, than those distributed to the small Intestine. Where the Aorta divides not as high as the Renal Arteries, a case of extremely rare occurrence, the smaller Mesenteric regularly rises from its Sternal aspect, a little to the left, in the space interposed be- tween the Renals and the common Iliacs: It divides soon into what are comparatively large branches, destined to the left Colon and Rectum. They form arches, like those to the right Colon and transverse ; while the most atlantal, inosculating with the branch of the larger Mesenteric that is ramified on the transverse Colon to the left, constitutes the Great Mesenteric Arch. The branch that is ramified upon the Rectum, runs longitudinally on its Dorsal aspect, inosculates with branches from the two Hypogastrics. and, though seldom extending its ramifications so far as the Sphincter, has its ultimate branches L

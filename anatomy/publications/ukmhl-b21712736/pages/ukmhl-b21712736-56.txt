INTRODUCTION. xxvm it is expedient, (and there are cases where it may be expedient,) to distinguish the parts by appropriate names, let them he distinguished by all means, but let them still be distinguished as parts, and not as wholes. As Arteries in general are ramified on the parts adjacent to their course, the course of the Artery ought first to be described to its utmost extent, in order that the student (who is always supposed to be previously acquainted with the parts adjacent,) may form at once a tolerably accurate, though general idea of the several organs on which it is ramified. For these reasons, the continuation of the trunk of an Artery should always be carefully distinguished from its branches ; a circumstance which, in the descrip- tion of the Arteries, is frequently overlooked : Thus, the Ranina is properly a continuation of the Lingual Artery; the Thyroid branch, a continuation of the Atlantal, or superior Thyroid ; the Infraorbitary, a continuation of the trunk of the internal Maxillary; and the Nasal branch, as it is called, a continuation of the trunk of the Opthalmic. Thus names are mul- tiplied without necessity, and by not following the course of the trunk, so far as it goes, we cannot so readily form an idea of the parts adjacent on which it is ramified. As all parts of the living body receive a regu- lar supply of blood, suited to their functions, and as all blood flowing in the branches ol the neighbour-

A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. 171 the Gastric, or if the Gastric happen to be the larger, it receives a name, implying that it sends off the Hepatic. On this principle, a Gastric branch is occasionally made to send off a Phrenic, while a Phrenic branch is made, in its turn, when it happens to be larger, to send off a Gastric. If I give a description of the ramifications of the Coeliac Artery, at once more concise and more suitable to its general character than is given by Haller, I wish the reader to be informed, that he is less indebted to me than he is to him for the improvement. Had it not been for his unweari- ed research and extensive information, I should not have had, from my own observations, or the writings of any other Anatomist, a sufficient number of authenticated facts to be able to distinguish what is general, from what is particular, in its ramifica- tions and mode of distribution. In all individuals that have yet been examined, the Coeliac rises from the Sternal aspect of the Aorta, where it enters the Abdomen between the two Crura of the Diaphragm. Its origin, therefore, is allantad of the Pancreas, sacrad of the Liver, dorsad of the Stomach, and dexlrad of the Spleen, in the close vicinity of the two Capsulas Atrabi- liaria?, of the two Semilunar ganglions, and of the Superior Mesenteric Artery, which always rises near it in succession, though very seldom rises along with K 5

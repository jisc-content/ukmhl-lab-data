207 A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. Interims, and Transversus Abdominis. It anasto- tomoses with the Circumflex Iliac, and forms a curve immediately within, and nearly parallel to the crest of the Ilium. It sometimes gives ramuli that enter the Foramina of the Os Sacrum, always inosculates with branches from the Lumbars, and sometimes gives off the last of the Lumbars. It is the Iliaca parva of Winslow, Lieutaud, and others. Haller thought the term Iliac too frequently repeated, and chose to call it the Iliolumbar (6). Cb) This name is certainly an improvement, as the young Anatomist is apt to be embarrassed with an Iliaca Parva, an Iliaca Communis, an Iliaca Externa, an Iliaca Interna, an Iliaca Postica, and an Iliaca Circumflexa, Antica, or Externa Minor. At the same time, the confusion arises not so much from the repetition of the word Iliac, as from the careless use'of the epithets External, 'Internal, Anterior, and Posterior. What is called the External Iliac, is certainly as much within the Ilium, as the Hypogastric or Internal Iliac. The Gluteal Artery, which Haller has named Iliaca Postica, forgetting his reasons against the repetition of the term Iliac, extends only to the dorsum of the Ilium through the medium of its branches. The name too seems to imply, that there is likewise an Iliaca Antica, the name given by Portal to the Iliac Portion of the Crural Artery, by Boyer to the Circumflex Iliac, or the Iliaca Externa Minor of Schaurschmid.â€”Haller, Eascic. v. p. 9. Dreading again the repetition of the term Iliac, Haller has given to the Circumflex'Iliac, the epithet Abdominalis, as if it were more an Artery of the Abdomen than the Coeliac, or any of the two Mesenteries, than any of the Lumbars, or the two

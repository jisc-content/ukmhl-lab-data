A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. 2G thence, observing a mesial direction, with some tor- tuous windings, proceeds to the Splieno-Maxillary fissure, where reaching the inial part of the orbit, it bends aniiniad along the canal of the Maxillary bone, and passing through the Infra-Orbitary hole, branches out on the muscles of the Lip, the Gums, Alveolar processes, and Teeth, inosculating with branches from the Labial, Opthalmic, and Temporal Arteries. The Anatomist, previously and intimately acquaint- ed with the bones, the muscles, and their relative situations, as he always ought to be, before he enters upon the study of Angeiology, will instantly perceive ing the canal of the Basilar Maxilla, emerges through one of the Foramina Menti to be ramified on the ymin, or chin. The first of these is named the Internal, the second, the Inferior Maxillary Artery, though the first has no corresponding branch called the external, nor the second any corresponding branch called the superior. This language, from implying relations that do not exist, is apt to mislead ; and, therefore, I propose to call the first, from its passing through the Orbit, the Orbito- maxillary, and the second, from its being ramified on the chin, the Genio-maxillary ; the term Genio being already familiar to Anatomists, from its enteriug into the uames of the Genio- hyoideus and Geniohyoglossus. Mr. Burns mentions one case, where the Labial and Tem- poral branches terminated the Pericephalic, and where the Orbito-maxillary sent off the Submental. In short, the usual origins were transposed.

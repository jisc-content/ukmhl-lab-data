13 A DESCRIPTION OF TIIE ARTERIES. ATLANTOTHYROIDEA, seu Thyroidea Superior (/')., Runs sacrad mesiad and steruad, and passing under the Omohyoideus and Sternothyroideus, at last ter- Instead of wondering at these exceptions from the general rule, we should rather be surprised that they are so few, and occur so seldom, considering that the parts on which these ves- sels are ramified, are principally organs of voluntary motion ; and regularly furnished with two sets of veins, superficial and deep. Even the forms and relative positions of these organs undergo changes. The two Rami of the Basilar Maxilla, in rising from the base, gradually approach nearer and nearer to the perpendicular as they advance towards maturity, while the length of the teeth, and deepening of the Jaw, and expansion of the Thorax, where the Vertebrae of the neck are not equally elongated, bring the Chin and the Sternum proportionally nearer, generally nearer in the Adult Male than they are in the Female, and nearer in the female than they are in the Fcetus, and farther as the Jaw is not only deepened, but, compared with the Cra- nium, more than proportionally lengthened in its growth ; and the head of the Sternum not only raised, but projected forwards, the two Cephalies, and their two branches must, with the Tra- chea and the (Esophagus, lie in general proportionally deeper in the adult male than they do in the female, and deeper in the female than they do in the Fcetus.

Boyer saw it rising by a common trunk with the lingual, and Mr Burns writes me, that he has lately seen it rising with the lingual, by a common trunk from the Cephalic ; that the lingual afterwards run along the lateral mar-

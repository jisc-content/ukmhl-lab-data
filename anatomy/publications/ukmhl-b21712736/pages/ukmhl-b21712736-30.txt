INTRODUCTION 11 The larger branches of all these Systems are some- times called Trunks, when viewed as the origins of their own particular ramifications ; a sort of lan- guage which, although incorrect, creates no confusion. The principal Trunks of the arteries are two ; one commencing at each ventricle of the heart. The one commencing at the right or pulmonic ventricle, is named the Pulmonic Artery, from being ramified through the Pulmones or lungs. It conveys blood of a. dark colour, which, on being exposed to the action of the air, in. its passage through the lungs, appears of a colour that is florid red. 4 ~ The other commencing at the left or systemic ventricle, is named the Aorta or Systemic Artery. It transmits the red and florid blood, through the medium of its branches, to the system at large. Both trunks are. furnished with valves at their commencement, to prevent tlie reflux of blood into the ventricles. In each the number of valves is three,, their fonn semi-lunar, and the only valves to be found'in the whole arterial system. -■ ln all the arteries, the blood flows from the trunks to the branches; in. the veins, it flows from the branches to the trunks, (a). tilt . cm • ■; sc v -j.l; .■> i :u,r* mat .

By the branches of one : extremity It collects the blood from the stomach, spleen, pan- creas, and intestines; and by the branches of the opposite ex- tremity distributes it through the liver.

A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. 32 inial margin of the Maxillary Ramus, at last crosses the Zygomatic Arch, and upon the fascia of the Temporal muscle divides into two conspicuous branches, the one spreading into ramifications coro- nad and iniad, the other spreading into ramifications coronad and glabellad. The first inosculating with the Occipital and Auricular Arteries, the second with branches reflected on the forehead from the Opthalmic, and both inosculating at the mesial plane with their fellows ramified on the opposite side. Between its origin and the Zygoma, this Tem- poral Artery gives out branches to the Parotid, to the Masseter, and transverse branches towards the nose, the coronal Lip (e), and the Orbicular muscles of the Orbit. It sends also branches .to the Auricle which, usually running to the convex side, inosculate with branches from the Auricular ; branches to the Meatus Auditorius Externus, and a branch to the (e) Sometimes gives off the Coronary Artery of the upper lip, when the Labial Artery is small or defective. In addition to the regular branches from the Pericephalic, Portal has given a long description of certain branches from this Artery, which he calls the Masseteric. He has seen them from oiie to four in number, and observes they are irregular in size and distribution. I have seen them also extending trans- versely across the Masseter,. and supplying the place of trans-

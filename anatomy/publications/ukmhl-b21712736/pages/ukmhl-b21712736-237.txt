A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. 175 “ Winslow® eontigit.”—Fustic. iii. />. 45. ARTERIA SPLENICA. Th'e separate origin of this Artery from the Aorta, as seen by Drelinconrt, Tulingius, and others, had never at any time beeta observed by Haller. It ge- nerally rises from the Trunk of the Coeliac, or rises as a branch from one of its divisions ; is usually smaller in the young subject than the common trunk of the Hepatics, when there is such a trunk; but usually larger than that Artery in the adult. It runs first sinislrad and sacrad, then sinistrad and at- lantad, and, during a great part of the course, runs near the Atlantal margin of the Pancreas, to which it gives out numerous branches, and branches some- times to the Mesocolon. When it approaches the seat of thfe Spleen, where that is attached to the Gaster or Stomach, in the line of the Gastrocolic Epiploon, it enters the concave side of that Viscus by several branches indefinite in number, and either directly, or through these branches, gives out other branches to the Stomach, under the name of Vasa Brevia. These Vasa Brevia spread on the left ex- tremity of the Stomach, and inosculate on the Sternal and Dorsal aspects with the neighbouring Gastrics. “ terica potlus quam, a Duodenali Ccsliacae oriretur.

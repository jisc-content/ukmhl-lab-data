In more than one instance, I have seen the Pudic arising from it, after leaving the Pelvis, and nearly equal to it in size; an origin of the Pudic not unfre- quently observed by Haller (c). ARTEMJB sacro-laterales. Two small Arteries, that run along the two lateral rows of Foramina on the Sternal aspect of the Os Sacrum. They send branches to the neighbouring nerves; branches mesiad, to meet the branches that are running laterad from the Sacro-median ; branch- es to the Vertebras; branches through the Foramina of the Sacrum to the Cauda Equina ; and branches, passing through the Dorsal Foramina, to the Sacro- lumbalis and Longissimus Dorsi, where they meet with ramuli that derive their origin from the Gluteal and the Ischiadic.

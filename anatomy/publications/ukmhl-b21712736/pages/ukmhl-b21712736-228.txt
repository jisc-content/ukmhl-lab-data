1 A description op the arteries. joyed by the Coeliae, in common with other Ar- temi Trunks, it has a peculiar claim to more a claim arising from the varying proportions of the principal organs on which it is distributed. In toung subjects, such as those from which he has taken his two figures, the proportional magnitude of the Liver is greater than in the adult, and the size of the Arteries varying with the size of the organs on which they are ramified (f), the Gastric branches in these figures seem only branches from the Hepatics; while the Splenic, which is larger in ■he adult than all the Hepatics taken together, is here but a branch of one of the Hepatics to the right lobe. Such varying proportions, from age or disease, are no small source of different appearances in the ramifications of the Coeliac Artery, and no un- usual source of confusion in the description. Thus, when a branch is distributed to both the Stomach and Liver, if the one to the Liver happen to be the larger, the Hepatic branch is then said to send off ff) See the present description of the Arteries, p. 11. and the Introduction, p. xxiv. and xxv. I„ the case mentioned by Mr. Abernethy of Bartholomew’s Hospital, where the Vena Bortae terminated in the Vena Cava, and where the Hepatic Artery was the only vessel that supplied the Liver with blood, for the purpose either of nutrition or secretion, it w’as found to be larger than common.

l6'S A description of the arteries. Fred Walther in 1729. In this account, accom- pamed with a figure, which, though not very elegant, 18 sufficient}y accurate as to the Anatomy, he fre- quently mentions the comparative distances in lines and inches, not recollecting, that, if these distances were in regular proportion, they must vary with the size of the individual, and, if not in proportion, must necessarily differ in different individuals of the same size, particularly in an Artery, which he has shown to enjoy such latitudes in the order, number, the magnitudes, and ramifications of its branches. To the varieties mentioned by Walther, the illustri- ous Haller, from his own observations and extensive reading, has made numerous additions, both in I*!8 Second and eiSht Fasciculus, and besides in Ins second has given two elegant engravings, repre- senting the branches of the Cceliac Artery, as they occurred in two individuals. To these branches he has given names, and most of these in allusion'to the parts on which they are ramified, as the Stomach, the Liver, the Spleen, the Pancreas, the Pylorus Duodenum, and the Epiploon. But, as each of t lese parts is supplied by branches that, in different individuals, exhibit diversities in origin, number, and ramification, their names, like those denoting a species in Natural History, must be general terms, and should never be employed to express any indivi- dual distinctions.

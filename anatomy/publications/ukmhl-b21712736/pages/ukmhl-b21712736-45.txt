â€” INTRODUCTION. XVli that every other individual of the species shall pre- sent varieties in a similar manner; and after arriving at this general conclusion, need we be told that cer- tain individuals, as A, B, C, have also had their share of varieties, and that would we only take pa- tience to listen, such and such an Anatomist could prove it by his plates, his descriptions, and his prepa- rations. That he certainly may do; but requesting our patience in such a case, is, in other words, insulting our judgment, unless the varieties can clearly be proved to reflect some important light on Medicine, to direct the operations of Surgery, or establish some general fact in Physiology (rt). If a Botanist should draw a particular plant to furnish some general idea (a) In studying Anatomy, the object of the student is first to be acquainted with the general or common structure of the species j and after acquiring this information, to know in gene- ral the modifications to which it is liable from age, sex, habit, and circumstances. In entering, however, on professional duties, as Surgeon'or Physician, the case will in some measure be reversed. Already acquainted with the general structure, and with its more general modifications, he now, with a patient under his care, must inquire minutely into what is peculiar in his constitution, what peculiar in his life and habits, peculiar in bis symptoms, and peculiar also in their mode of combina- tion ; and by these peculiarities in a great measure must regu- late his practice; it being obvious, that to practice successfully, he must know something more than the species of his patient.

27a A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES, Artery, it might naturally be supposed that the two Ventricles, and the two Arteries, compared respec- tively, would be very nearly of equal capacities. Many, however, on comparing these organs, have found that the Right Auricle and Ventricle were larger than the left; and Helvetius saw that the branches of the Artery, ramified on the Lungs, were larger than the concomitant Veins. A number of learned and ingenious theories had been invented to explain these phenomena, until accurate experiment and observation showed that they originated from causes accidental; from accumulations of blood, in the greatest number of natural deaths, preventing the Right Auricle and Ventricle, and the branches of the Artery from contracting so much as tiiey would have contracted, had they been able to have emptied themselves into the vessels of the opposite side (x). The conclusion is confirmed by vrhat is frequently the state of the Colon ; if completely emptied previous to death, and the other Intestines found to retain their usual diameter, it is sometimes found the smallest of the whole. If the Aorta, near its commencement, and emptied of its blood, be still found larger than the Pulmonary Artery, it must occur to the Surgeon and Anatomist, from the (j) Sabatier. Memoire premiere.

A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. 95 G 2 and the muscles that rise from it. It sometimes originates among the Thoracics, but generally after them, at some more distant part of the course of the Axillary Portion, and not far from the tendons of the Peetoralis and Latissimus Dorsi. In point of magnitude, it does not appear much inferior to the Humeral Artery, and in those cases, where it fur- nishes the deep and the two circumflex Arteries of the Humerus, is even larger. In different indi- viduals, it is known to exhibit different varieties of ramification (p) ; but always sends branches to the Subscapular muscle, the Latissimus Dorsi, the Teres Major, the Teres Minor, and the Infra-spinatus; sending often branches to the Axillary Glands, the Capsular Ligament, and to some of the tendons of the muscles attached to it. Of what might be deemed its regular branches, there are two comparatively large in size, the one I would call the Sacro-scapular, and the other is ahead}' known by the name of the Circumjlex Scapu- lar. The Sacro-scapular, continued somewhat in (p) What Murray calls its Romus Muscularis, for instance, is often wanting, ami its place, partly and principally, supplied by an Artery, which, in his language, is an Artery, “ lusignis “ niagnitudinm, et sa:pe propria: originis, in Mibscapulari Ar- “ tcrias, ad basiin usque Scapulae pror: pentes eniittc iis, et “ porro ad Teretem Majorem, Serrntuui, Latissimuin, Ulaudu- “ lasque alares surculos validos (onge lateque dispergens.”,

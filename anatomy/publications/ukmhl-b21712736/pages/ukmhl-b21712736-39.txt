INTRODUCTION. XI and nutrition, are returned by the vessels that are named Absorbents. These absorbents are a sub- ordinate system of veins, and furnished with valves similar to those that are found in the veins. Besides the places already enumerated, many com- mence towards the surface and in open cavities, while thewhole, by reiterated unions of their branches, termi- nate generally in two trunks, the largest called the Tho- racic Duct, which, receiving from branches (a) open- ing on the central aspect of the alimentary canal, all (a) These absorbents, denominated Lacteals, were seen by Herophilus and Erasistratus, and afterwards seen and their use pointed out by the modest Asellius ; and as Asellius pub- lished his account of them several years before the death of Harvey, Dr. Hunter mentions it as a stain on the character of Harvey, that he did not seem inclined to believe in their existence. The fact is, Harvey admitted the existence of the vessels that were seen by Asellius, but would not admit that in all cases there regularly was a set of chyliferous vessels dis- tinct from the veins, until the existence of such vessels could be regularly proved in all cases where chyle was conveyed from the intestines. Now, that proof had never been fur- nished in the time of Harvey, while his age and infirmity, and the want of Dr. Highmore as an assistant, deterred him from the trouble of personal and laborious investigation. The very bead and front of bis offending, therefore, were this, that he was old, infirm, and without assistance, and could not yield his assent to a truth on either deficient or conjectural evi- dence.

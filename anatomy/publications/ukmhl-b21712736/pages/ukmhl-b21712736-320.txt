262 A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. cs the Malleolares, because they are ramified upon the Ancles. Haller calls another the Arteria Tar- sea, that runs Jihulad under the Extensors across the Tarsus; and another the Arleria Melatarsea, fiom its 1 unning Jibulad on the Proximal extremi- ty of the Metatarsus. These last branches, meet- ing with some of the Plantar branches at the Fi- bulai aspect, aie converted into what Anatomists call Arches. From the convexity of these arches, branches run distad along the Interossei ; if they be large from the Tarsal arch, the Metatarsal is small, or is wanting ; if they be small from the Tarsal arch, the Metatarsal is observed to be larger, and to send offâ€™ the branches to the Interossei. But these two arches can scarcely be reckoned regular appearances, in some individuals, they are very indistinct, and in others, the eye, though assisted by the fancy, can- not discern them. The functions of both themselves and their branches, are sometimes performed by branches proceeding directly from the Trunk to the Interossei; sometimes again by a Vascular Plexus formed by numerous branches from the Trunk, and by branches from the Plantar aspect of the Foot, penetrating through Interosseous spaces, or inoscu- lating on the Tibial and Fibular aspects. I have one preparation minutely injected, where large branches are seen running along the Interossei, and which, as is evident from the injection, had received a supply

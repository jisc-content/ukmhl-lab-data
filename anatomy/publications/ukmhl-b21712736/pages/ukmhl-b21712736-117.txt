A DESCRIPTION OF TUE ARTERIES. 59 ARTERIA VERTEBRALIS, Though not the first of the four branches (y), yet, as it completes the Arteries of the Cerebrum and Cerebellum, we shall make it the first in the order of description.

Viderunt is without a nominative, so we are not informed who saw these Arteries. Willis saw the Vertebral Artery of the right side supplying the place of the right Encephalic, and three times larger than the Vertebral Artery of the left side.

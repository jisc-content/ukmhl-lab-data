212 A DESCRIPTION’ OF THE ARTERIES. ging through the whole of their course, the two at last generally meet and form the arch already de- scribed. Sometimes one of the two is wanting; sometimes there are more than one on a side, when they are always smaller and of less extent, in propor- tion to their number. They sometimes inosculate with the last of the Lumbars; and not unfrequently send ramuli to the Glands lying dorsad of the Iliac Portion of the Crural. Their origin is sometimes in the Hypo-iliac, sometimes in one, and sometimes in another of its branches ; but very rarely in the Lumbar Portion of the Crural Artery (d). ARTER1AE UTERINAE. Flexuous branches ramified on the Uterus, and varying their size with the state of the organ, as it enlarges during impregnation, or as it contracts after (tf) Haller, speaking of these branches, says, “ A trunco “ vero Iliac® ut J. B. Winslowo obtigit nonduui ortas fuisse “ vidi.”—Fascic. iv. p. 28. The passage of Winslow, to which he refers, is in § 229, where, treating of the branches from the Lumbar Portion of the Crural Artery, he says, there are few of any note: “ excepte quelques Arterioles qui vont a l’Os Sa- “ crum, et dont quelques unes entrent par les Trous Supe- “ rieures de cet os, et s’y distribuent comme les Sacrecs."

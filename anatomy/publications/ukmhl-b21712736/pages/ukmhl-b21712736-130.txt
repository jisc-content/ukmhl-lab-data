A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. Haller, Fascic, vii. p. 15. T2 uniting, enter the extremities of the Dorsal ca- nals. These canals are also described as receiving branches from the Vertebral Arteries, the deep Cer- vical, or some branches of the Sacrothyroid in the region of the Neck, from the Intercostals in the region of the Thorax, and from the Lumbar in the region of the Loins, and receiving these branches opposite to each Inter-vertebral space. But the truth is, although they always receive branches from the neighbouring Arteries in these regions, observation and experience have not shown, that they receive them in any regular and uniform manner, proportioned to the number of Vertebral interstices (m). The branches that communicate with the Spinal canals in these regions, are known by the name of Arterice Medullares, to distinguish them from those that “ de' la moelle Epini&re, desquels quelquesuns aprfes avoir “ concouru a la formation du laeis qui l’entoure, se reunissent, *{ et forment l’Artfcre Spinale Posterieure.”—Portal. {m) “ Horum ramorum qui nervis vamulos dant, piaeque “ membranse, et cum Spinalibus longis rarie inosculantur, “ numerus minor est, quam Vertebrarum, et multa saepft “ Vertebrarum intervalla ejusmodi ramo destituuntur tam “ Arteriori quam posteriori.

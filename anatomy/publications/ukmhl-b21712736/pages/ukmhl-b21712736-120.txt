A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. 62 Artery sends out branches to the muscles adjacent, and where it has the greatest distance to cross be- tween the Vertebra Dentata and Atlas, sends out branches that are larger than the rest, and which, after spreading on the neighbouring muscles, are seen inosculating with branches from the Occipital Artery. * In its passage through the processes, it runs slernad of the Cervical nerves that issue through the Inter-vertebral spaces, and is one of the Arteries which, through these interstices, sends branches to the Spinal Marrow and its Involucra (d). (d) “ Quatuor Involucris Spinalis Medulla Circumvestitur. “ Quorum Jirimum est membrana nervosa, crassa et fortis quse “ intern® Vertebrarum specus superficiei firmiter adh*ret “ Secundum est membrana crass® meningi continua.—Tertium est membrana tenuis et pellucida, Pia meningi continua. “ Quartum Pi® meningis productionem esse asserimus tertio “paulo crassius et validius apparet.”—Vide Vieus. Neuro- graph. Universal, lib. ii. cap. 2. Haller alludes to these Invo- lucra, where he treats of the Arteries of the Spinal Marrow in his seventh Fasciculus, and calls the first the Involucrum Ver- tebrurum. But though authors have talked of this Involucrum since the days of Galen, they seem not to have conveyed any clear and precise ideas of its nature and extent Winslow, who has given the most accurate description of it under the name of Tuyau Ligamenteux Entonnoir, describes it as formed of the Fascia Longitudinalis Postica Vertebrarum, and of that dense Cellular membrane, which continued from hear the sides.

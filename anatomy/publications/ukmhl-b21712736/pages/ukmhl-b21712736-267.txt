A DESCRIPTION Or THE ARTERIES. 209 to inosculate also in a similar manner with the neighbouring Arteries; some of them inosculating in this way, near the crest of the Ilium, with the last of the Lumbars; some on the Dorsal aspect of the Sacrum with the Sacro-laterals ; some upon the Gluteus Magnus and Pyriformis, with the Ischiadic; some upon the Gluteus Medius, and near the Aceta- bulum, with the External Circumflex of the Femur; and some, near the origin of the Sartorius, with the Circumflex Iliac. The Iliolumbar, the Obturatoria, a Sacro-lateral, the Pelvien Pudic, and some Haemorrhoidals, are not unfrequently among its branches, before it leaves the cavity of the Pelvis. ARTERIA ISCHIADICA, The next in size to the Gluteal; but more in the general direction of the trunk, issues from the Pelvis between the Pyriformis and the Gemelli, and, like the last, immediately under the Gluteus Magnus. Its usual course, while it preserves the appearance of a trunk, is towards the space between the Tro- chanter Major of the Femur, and the Tuberosity of the Os Ischium ; but rather inclining to the Tuberosity.

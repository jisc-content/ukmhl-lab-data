36 A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. canal that afterwards succeeds, through its different windings, runs by the side of the Sella Tursica bathed in the blood of the Cavernous Sinus, at last reaches the Foramen Opticum on the mesial side of that afterwards unite, suoh a plexus of vessels, when it oc- curs in the course of the Encephalic, being termed the Rete Mirabile of Galen, as a similar plexus in the course of the Opthalmic, has been styled the Rete Mirabile of Hovius. I have mentioned already, that an appearance, analogous to these, is to be found in the Mesenteric Arteries of the Sow, and in the Iliac and Humeral Arteries of the Lemur Tardi- gradus. Mr. Carlisle of London, who observed it in the Lemur Tardigradus, observed it also in the Lemur Loris, in the Bradypus Tridactylus, and the Bradypus Didactlyus, and remarking a correspondence between the minute-division of their Arteries, and their slowness of motion, was led to the general and important conclusion, that there are certain specific relations between the species of muscular motions, and the species of vascular ramifications. A similar idea had occurred to Willis, when treating of the Rete Mirabile of .Galen ; and the truth seems to be, that where changes in any of the functions of organs are connected with changes in the state of circulation, the succession of the changes which take place in the organs, must always be slow proportioned to the slowness with which changes are effected in the state of circu- lation. In cases, therefore, where the Arteries divide into Reti- form plexuses, convoluted or expanded, the actions of the organs on which they are ramified, so far as these actions de- pend on the quantity or momentum of the blood, must com- paratively be more steady and uniform, and whether they be naturally rapid or slow, must be less suddenly influenced by

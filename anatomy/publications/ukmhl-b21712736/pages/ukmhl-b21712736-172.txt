114 A description of the arteries. The Radial Artery, whatever be the place or mode ,tS 0nSin’18 always to be found towards the Radial side of the fore-arm, running generally, and with i-lea of the Humeral Artery. Mr. Bell’s language is, “ The “ Humeral Artery having left this most critical point at the be„djng of the arm, divides into three great branches, tie lir"D'AL'. ULNAR> and Intki50sseoo« Arteries; at least, the „ na,r S‘VeS °ffthe lnterosseous so soon, and the interosseous 18 S° large’ and has 50 Poised a destination, that I take the “ privilege of describing the three branches apart. „ “ ThC Kadial Arte'ry goes off ‘ike a branch from the Ulnar, or, in other words, the Ulnar seems to continue in the course of the mam Artery, while the Kadial goes off to one side; “ The Interosseous, again, is truly a branch from the Ulnar • “ !t comes off where the Ulnar lies deepest. “ These are the great divisions of the Artery,” (namely the Humeral.) Portal describes the usual division of the Humeral Artery into what are called the Radial and Ulnar branches, as a little above the bend of the arm; and, like Mr. Bell, afterwards talks ot the Radial Artery, as being sometimes a branch of the Ulnar. “ L’Artbre Brachiale parvenue ordinairemeut, comme il a “ dit’ Un peu au'-|essu du pli du coude, se divise en deux “ branches principals qui descendent sur Pavant bras, dont “ Pune est appelee Cubitale parcequ’elle suit cPassez pres le “ CubitUS’ et 1>autre est aPPe1^ Radiate parcequ’elle corres- “pond au Radius; celle-ci est quelquefois une tranche de la “ Cubitale." Speaking of the place, where the Humeral Arterv divides into what are called the Radial and Ulnar branches. » About

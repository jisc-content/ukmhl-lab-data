u A description op the arteries. â€¢ PUDICA PELVIENA (f), A branch distributed to the Sexual organs, rises singly from the Hypo-iliac, or along with some one of its branches, and often along with the Ischiadic, from which it is afterwards observed to separate, sometimes without, but more frequently within the Pelvis. If it separate without, the common trunk, or some other Artery, furnishes the branches which it usually gives to the parts within. If it separate within, it still accompanies the Ischiadic out of the Pelvis. What is peculiar and singular in its course, is, that it always returns into the Pelvis between the Sacro-ischiadic ligaments, attaches it- self to the Mesial aspect of the Ischial Tuberosity, piotetted by a process of the larger ligament against any lateral pressure from the Rectum, continues this couise close to the Ramus of the Ischium and Pubis, till it reaches the Symphysis, when it turns sudden- ly on the Dorsum of the Penis, stretching along it, under the Integuments, and parallel to its fellow, as (f) Th's Artery lias been named simply Pudenda, some- times Pudenda Communis, Pudenda Circumflexa, Pudenda In- terna, Pudenda Media, Pudenda Externa, I have here dis- tinguished it by the epithet Pelvienn, the Pudic from the Pelvis, which can never be applied to the Pudic branches ori- ginating in the Groin.

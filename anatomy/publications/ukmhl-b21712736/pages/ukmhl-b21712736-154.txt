JU A description of the arteries. they spring by a common stem from the Axillary 1 ortion ; sometimes, again, by a common stem from its Scapular branch; and sometimes the larger or Anconal branch, rises in common with the deep Ar- tery of the Humerus. THE HUMERAL PORTION. The Humeral Portion of the Brachial Artery commences where the Axillary Portion ends, and is usually described as extending thence to the bend of the arm, where it divides into the Radial and Ulnar branches. But this description, although consistent with the figures given by Eustachius and Haller, does not correspond with the appearances which the Artery often exhibits in the species. If the Humeral Portion is to be defined as terminating always in what are called the Radial and Ulnar branches, there are many cases, where it must terminate near the Axilla, and at all the distances between that and the bend of the arm. On the other hand, if it be defined as always extending to the bend of the arm, one or other of the two branches, which are now denominated the Radial and Ulnar, must as- sume the name of Humeral Artery; so that the term Humeral Artery, or Humeral Portion of the Biachial Aiteiy, must, at different times, be made to

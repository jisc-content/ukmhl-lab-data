123 A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. h 5 in this, that the branches of the same Vascular System, when they are near, or when they are rami- fied on the same organ, are often observed to unite and separate, and to unite and separate again, form- ing a kind of Retiform textures that are called Plexuses. In these Plexuses many of the Ramuli are so minute, that, in their natural and healthy state, they convey only a transparent fluid, and are not to be discerned by the naked eye, unless when they happen to be filled with red blood, or with coloured injection, and then the parts on which they are observed, appear as if chiefly composed of vessels. When impediments, however, or any obstructions, partial or complete, chance to take place in the cir- culation of the larger vessels, from which they im- mediately or ultimately spring, the smaller branches, if they be necessary to preserve the circulation, are gradually enlarged, and their Anastomoses or inosculations soon grow conspicuous. Such en- largements, and such conspicuous inosculations, should naturally occur at the bend of the arm, where the circulation is apt to be impeded, in the larger vessels, from the frequent extensions and flexions of the joint. In most cases, we accord- ingly observe distinct and obvious inosculations between the branches of the Profunda and Anas- tomotic on one side, and certain recurrent branches from the Radial, the Interosseal, the common Trunk

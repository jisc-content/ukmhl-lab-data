280 A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. The animal processes, in different genera and spe- cies of animals, require different degrees of tempera- ture, and therefore, if their internal temperature be raised or lowered, beyond a certain limited range t ey sicken or die. Many species have the power of preserving their internal temperature, amidst wide diversities of external temperature; those who have not, become torpid in the colder seasons, or are re- stricted to regions and climates, where the diversities of external temperature are more confined. Plants that have little of internal heat, if they inhabit the same latitudes, and require different degrees of tem- perature, are compelled to live at different altitudes from the level of the sea. Some species of animals have proportionally larger and some proportionally smaller Lungs of the same kind of structure. Some classes of animals have the whole of their blood circulated through the Pulmon- ary vessels; and some classes only a part of it. Where the Lungs are large in proportion to the body, where the whole blood is circulated through themâ€™ or circulated rapidly, the temperature in general is high ; where only a portion of the blood passes through them, where they are small, or the blood circulated with a less velocity,' the temperature in general is proportionally low. Whether Carbon be discharged, or Oxygen receiv- ed, one of the intentions of respiration evidently is

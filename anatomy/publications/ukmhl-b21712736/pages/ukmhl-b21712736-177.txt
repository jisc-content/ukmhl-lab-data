A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. lig H 3 dips with the Tendon of the Biceps under the Su- blimis, and terminates in the Ulnar and Interosseal. The Ulnar Artery, with several deflexions, runs ulnad and distad between the Sublimis, the Pro- fundus, and Flexor Ulnaris; on approaching the Car- pus, gradually becomes more superficial; under the Fascia, runs close by the Radial side of the Os Pisiforme; and from thence, beneath the Aponeu- rosis Palmaris, towards the Radial side of the Car- pus, when it generally forms a species of curve that is convex distad, and which has been named the Superficial Volar Arch. On the contrary, when the Humeral terminates in the Radial and Interosseal, the course of the Ul- nar is generally different; it rises high, runs super- ficially above the muscles, not unfrequently above the Fascia, and, on the fore-arm, somewhat nearer to the Radial aspect than when it lies deep. On approaching, however, the bones of the Carpus, it is generally found under the Fascia, running close by the Radial side of the Os Pisiforme, and if not forming a Super- ficial Volar Arch, at least, spreading into Volar branches beneath the Aponeurosis Palmaris. The character, therefore, of this Artery is, that whether it originate in the region of the Humerus, or of the fore-arm, whether its course be superficial or deep, it is always found on the Thcnal aspect,

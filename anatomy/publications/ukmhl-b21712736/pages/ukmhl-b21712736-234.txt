A description of the arteries. tremity of the Pancreas, towards the Fossa of the Vena Portae (?); and at one time, saw the Superior Mesenteric supply all the Arteries of the Liver (k). In general, however, the Liver is supplied from the Cceliac Artery by a branch that divides towards nght and left, on approaching the Fossa of the Vena Port*; by a branch that has an earlier division ; or occasionally by two or more separate branches, some proceeding directly from the Coeliac, or from a trunk common to them, and to either a Phrenic or a Gastric branch. They usually enter at the trans- verse Fossa, or Fossa Vena Port*, the left at that extremity of the Fossa that terminates in the Fossa Umbilicalis; branches too have occasionally been seen entering the Fossa Ductus Venosi, or that seeming continuation of the Fossa Umbilicalis be- tween the left Lobe, and the Lobulus Spigelii. Pre- vious to their entrance, those which are adjacent send branches to the Vesicula Fellis, the Ductus Cysticus, and Ductus Hepaticus; some send Ra- muh to the Ligamentum Suspensorium, that in- osculate with Ramuli of the Sternal Arteries, and some Ramuli that inosculate round the Coronary Ligament with Ramuli from the Phrenics.

174 A DESCRIPTION OF TIIE ARTERIES. naturally inosculate with the branches distributed on .these organs. It frequently happens that an Hepatic, and some- times a Phrenic, arises with one of these Gastric branches from some of the larger divisions of the Coeliac; in that case, the Anatomist, fond of novel distinctions, and of perpetuating his remarks by names, extends the appellation of the common trunk to the larger branch, and as the two often vaiy in proportion from different causesâ€™, the Gastric branch is sometimes said to give off the Hepatic; the He- patic sometimes to give off the Gastric; the Gastric, the Phrenic ; and the Phrenic, the Gastric, just as the one or the other at the time happens to predo- minate in point of magnitude. The reader who is anxious to know the names that have been given to the gastric branches, will find a number of the most important in the note be- low *. * A branch running on the concave part of the arch of the Stomach towards the Cardia, is named Coronaria Superior by Haller and Cowper, Gastrica Major by Bauhin, Diember- broeck, and others, Gastrica by G'lisson, Epigastrica by Lower, Gastrica Sinistra by Keil, Gastrica Superior by Walther.

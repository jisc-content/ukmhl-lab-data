A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. 26l o 2 Immediately on arriving at tlie Rotular aspect., it sends off a branch that is named the Recurrent, ascending between the Extensor Digitorum and Ti- bialis Anticus, distributing Ramuli to these muscles, to the parts around the head of the Fibula, uniting also with the Disto-Articulars, and entering the Vas- cular Plexus of the Knee Joint. A little farther advanced in its progress, it is fre- quently seen giving out another of considerable size, that, penetrating through the Extensor Digitorum, runs distad on the Fibula between the Extensor and Peroneous Longus, as far as the Ancle. It is also observed, through the whole of its course, send- ing off branches in great numbers, at small distances, and limited in extent of ramification; some running peripherad to the Integuments; some ramified on the Periosteum ; some communicating with perforat- ing branches that pass through the Ligament ; and some communicating with other branches from the same aspect on the Tibial and Fibular sides of the Leg. The same mode of general distribution is con- tinued throughout; for whether it be on the Leg or Foot, it every where inosculates, through the me- dium of its branches, with branches that pass through Interosseous spaces, and, upon the Tibial and Fi- bular aspects, with branches that originate in the Popliteal. Murray calls two of these lateral branch-

A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. 8 ARTERIA ANONYMA, i<- seu Innominala. This common trunk of the right Cephalic, and the right Brachial, rises near the summit of the Arch beyond the Pericardium, and divides nearly op- posite to the Atlantal extremity of the Sternum (/*). (A) It has been observed on- the Sternal aspect of the Trachea, extending Atlantad as far as the coniines of the Thyroid Gland. See Burns on Varieties of the larger Arteries. The Cephalic and Brachial, to which it gives origin, sometimes arise from the Aorta, but then the form of the Arch is different, and its span more extended. In the usual form of the Arch, this common trunk becomes necessary to preserve an equality of the circulating fluids in the two sides. For supposing the Brachial and Cephalic branches of the same magnitudes, as when they arise from the common trunk, to rise separately from the Arch of the Aorta in its usual form, the one next the Ventricle, opening obliquely on the side of the current, would receive proportionally much less blood, than the one whose orifice is situated higher, and mere directly opposed to its force. The left Brachial and Cephalic, and the two Cephalies, have been seen originating by common trunks. See Portal. Soem- merring saw a case where two trunks only rose from the Arch, one sending off the two Cephalies, and the other the two Bra- ehials. The cases where the right Cephalic and Brachial arise from the Ventricle, and not from the Aorta, and the case of two Aortas, as in quadrupeds, where the one called ascending, sent off the Brachial and Cephalic Arteries, have repeatedly been

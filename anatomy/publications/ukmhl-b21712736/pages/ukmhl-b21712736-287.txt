At that place, resting on the Psoas and Ili- acus Internus where these arc united, the Crural Vein situated mesiai, the Nerve later ad, and each surrounded, as well as the Absorbents in their vici- nity, with a somewhat more than usual proportion of Cellular membrane (<) it sends off, as its regular branches, the Epigastric and Circumflex Iliac ; as * See Philosophical Transactions, pt. 1.1800, andpt. 1. 1804.

~8 A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. / The Gcniomaxillary Branch, called the Inferior Maxillary, and which I have pro- posed to distinguish by the name of the Genio- maxillary, immediately before it enters the canal, sends that branch to the Internal Pterygoid, which leaves a depression in the Maxillary Ramus. On entering the canal it runs basilad, till it reaches near the base of the Jaw, then bends antiniad be- tween the base and the fangs of the Teeth, sending Ramuli to each of the Teeth, and their Alveolar processes. Arriving at the Foramen Menti, it sends branches onward to the Incisures, and at last, emerging through the Foramen, is seen spreading into several branches upon the muscles of the Basilar Lip, inosculating freely with the branches proceeding from the Labial Artery. The Foramen Ovale being very near the Foramen Spinosum, a Ramulus is observed running along the third branch of the fifth pair of nerves to the Dura Mater. Meningeal Branch (z). The branch that enters the Foramen Spinosum is always conspicuous, and is well denominated the (z) Sabatier saw this Artery entering the Cranium by the Squamous Suture, “ au Milieu de la Suture qui unit cet os (le “ temporal) avec le parietal," and afterwards ramified in the usual way.

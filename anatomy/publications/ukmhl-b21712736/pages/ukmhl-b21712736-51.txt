INTRODUCTION. xxiii in all the individuals which I have examined during the course of these last twelve years ; appearances which I also have found in a great number of dried preparations, of which, besides those of my own col- lection, I have seen not a few; and appearances, which, as I have learned from their writings, were also found in the individuals that were seen by Eustachius, Win- slow, Lieutand, Haller, Sabatier, Murray, Portal, Boy- er,Bichat, Soemmerring, and others. What exceptions I have known from those general appearances, I shall mention, and among the number, those collected by my friend Mr. Allan Burns, of Glasgow, who, with a libera- lity which I never shall forget, has not only favoured me repeatedly with a sight of his valuable collection, but has generously offered to send me any preparation that I might wish to examine more minutely. These exceptions (a) from a more general law, though occurring but once in a hundred times, have often a strong claim to our attention, and more particularly if occurring in places where they might occasionally affect the mode and the result of surgical operations. (a) The intelligent reader need not he informed of the dif- ference between an exception and a variety. As varieties were never meant to be comprehended under the general rule, they cannot be reckoned deviations or exceptions from it.

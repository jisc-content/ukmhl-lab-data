A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. 197 will appear only the branches at another. It is thus we can explain, why Anatomists describe the same Artery as sometimes the trunk, and sometimes the branch of another Artery ; why Phrenic Arteries are said at times to give out Capsulars, and Cap- sulars in their turn to give out Phrenics. In the Foetus, where the Capsulars are so large in propor- tion, Portal has seen a Capsular branch from the Renal Artery, as large as the Renal Artery itself, and sometimes, he adds, even larger than the Renal (6). AUTERI.E ADIPOS.E. The Kidnies are enveloped in adipose substance, and the Arteries sent to it have thence been named .irlerice Adiposcc. Like the Capsular Arteries, they arise from several different sources, from the Aorta, from the Phrenic, the Renal, Spermatic, Capsular, and (4) To speak of a branch being larger than its Trunk, is not usual, nor is it accurate. But Portal’s words are, “ Cette “ Artere des corps sur-renaux est dans le Foetus pour le moins “ aussi grosse et quelquefois davantage que l’Artere Renale “ qui la foumit; elle diminue de grosseur aprfes la naissance “de l’enfant, de meme que le corps sur-renale, en meme temps “ que l’Art£re Renale s’amplifie ainsi que le rein dans lequel “ elle se distribue.”—Portal Des Arte res lienales.

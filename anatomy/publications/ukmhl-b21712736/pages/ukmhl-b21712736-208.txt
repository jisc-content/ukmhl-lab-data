I / A DESCRIPTION OF TIIE ARTERIES. to be perfected in the left, or Systemic, Ventricle, it can be generated no where else, as the Aorta, in his opinion, has no communication whatever with the Lungs by Arterial vessels, either great or small. This reasoning of Columbus, in which the lesser circulation of the blood is rather supposed than de- monstrated, would have naturally prepossessed him against the idea of Bronchial Arteries, if he ever had heard that such Arteries existed. But he seems to have never heard of such vessels, and ventures his assertion without the suspicion of being contra- dicted, or of differing in opinion from any one of his predecessors. Laurentius, Spigelius, and several others, were as ignorant of these Arteries as he; so that Frederick Ruyscb, who was less of a learned than practical Anatomist, when he first saw a Bronchial Artery, boldly asserted, that he was the first who had ever observed one (g). His rivals and enemies, to mortify his pride, and silence his boasting, lost no time in making him acquainted with what had been said of Bronchial Arteries by Era- sistratus, Galen, and Marchettis. His friend however, John Henry Graetz, (k) was not less prompt, or less (g) “ Hanc Arteriam a nemine adhuc observatam esse, in- trep.de affirmo.” -Observnt. Anatomica xv- vol. I. (A) I'-pist.

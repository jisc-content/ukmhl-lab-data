153 A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. be blood of the same, or very nearly of the same quality as that which flows in the Aorta, and is afterwards distributed through the medium of its branches to the system at large. In animals with but one Auricle and Ventricle, branches proceeding from the Aorta are the only Arteries that are ramified upon the organs of breath- ing ; so that vessels, analogous to the Bronchial Ar- teries, are more general in the Animal Kingdom, than even a Pulmonic Artery itself. ARTERI.E (ESOPIIAGE/E. Strictly speaking, CEsophageal Arteries ought to include all those Arterial branches that are rami- fied on the Portion of the Alimentary canal, termed (Esophagus, and which extends from the Pharynx to the Stomach. In the region of the Neck, this Por- tion receives branches from the Sacrothyroid, from other branches of the Subclavian, and from the Subclavian Artery itself, though generally branches without a name. The Arteries here called (Eso- phageal, are those which, originating in the cavity of the Thorax, are afterwards wholly, or principally, ramified on that Portion of the (Esophagus that ex- tends from the first rib to the Cardia. Like the Bronchial Arteries, they are indefinite as to their size, number, and origin ; but larger in size when

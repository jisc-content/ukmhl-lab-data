24 A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. < through the substance of the Parotid, runs iniad and laicrad to the fold or depression between the Mastoid process and Auricle, when it spreads into branches ramified on the convex part of the Auricle, and the muscles attached to it, on the Mastoid pro- cess, and the muscles which are there, and into branches which extending coronad iniad glabellad inosculate with branches from the Occipital and Temporal Arteries. In its course to the Mastoid process and Auricle, it sends out a number of small branches to the Parotid, and generally a branch called the Stylo- mastoid to the Foramen Stylomastoideum. â€™After entering the Foramen, transmits Ramuli to the Mastoid cells, to the Meatus Auditorius Externus, the Membrana Tympani, the Stapedius, says Haller, and the External Semicir- cular Canal, and these branches meeting with others from the Meningeal and Articular Arteries, par- ticularly on the Membrane, in the Meatus, and in the coronal part of the Tympanum, are observed to communicate by a variety of Anastomoses. (jr) Haller saw it twice from the Occipital Artery, once as a primary branch of the Pericephalic, but generally as a branch of the Auricular. The Stylomastoid (>r) \

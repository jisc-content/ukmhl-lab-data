83 A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. tomist, that it should occasionally receive branches from the Aorta, the Arteria Anonyma, the Subcla- vian Portion of the Brachial Artery, or the two Cardiacs, as well as from the Sternal or Internal Mammary; or that the Ramuli of these branches, where they extend along the trunks of the large blood-vessels, or along the Pleura, should be found by injections to inosculate with the Arteries that are named Bronchials. Haller saw a case, where the right Phrenic, originating in the Abdominal Aorta, passed through the Diaphragm with the Vena Cava, branched afterwards on the Pericardium, and inos- culated with the Artery that was seen accompanying the Phrenic nerve (c). The Phrenic Arteries are properly those, which are ramified on the Diaphragm, and one of the number is that which accompanies the Phrenic nerve, and thence called the Comes Nervi Phrenici, or sometimes Pericurdio-Diaphragmalica. It generally rises from the Sternal Artery ; though, as Haller remarks, it is sometimes a branch from one of the Thymics. The other Arteries that accompany the Nerve for a certain way, but terminate before they extend to the Diaphragm, are rather Pericardiac, than Phrenic branches (rf). \ (c) See Haller, Fascic. iii. p. 25. Not 8. (d) Almost every individual of the species may present varieties of Mediastinal, Thymic, Pericardiac, and Phrenic

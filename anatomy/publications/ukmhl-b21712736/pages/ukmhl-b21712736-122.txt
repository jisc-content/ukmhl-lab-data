04 A DESCRIPTION OP THE ARTERIES. ty of the Cranium (e), it sends off the Posterior Meningeal, or posterior Artery of the Dura Mater, an Artery which is afterwards extensively ramified on that membrane where it encompasses the Cere- bellum, and which often is seen, through the medium of its branches, inosculating freely with the other Meningeals. Inferior Cerebellar Branches, ^ hen within the Cranium, generally from the V ertebral, although occasionally from the Basi- lar Artery, one or more branches that sometimes unite, are seen bending coronal and iniad between the crus of the Cerebellum and Medulla Oblongata, and spieading as far as the Vermiform process. This Artery or Arteries, together with their fellows In his second Fasciculus, where he had not so minutely ex- amined the Involucra, he makes the Vertebral Artery to send off a ramum majusculum cum singulo nervorum pare ad medul- lam spinalem. But afterwards finds, vide Fascic. via. that the branches which regularly pass through Vertebral interstices, go often no farther than this first Involucrum, or Involucrum Vertebrarum.

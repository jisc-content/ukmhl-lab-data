A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. 2 GO TIBIALIS ANTICA Passes in general from the Popliteal to the Ro- tular aspect, at the Distal margin of the Popliteus, and, although between the Tibia and Fibula, does not perforate the Interosseous Ligament, but passes before the Ligament commences (q). On the Rotular aspect, it runs dislad along the Ligament; at first, between the Extensor Digitorum and Extensor Pollicis, and then between the Ex- tensor Pollicis and Tibialis Anticus. Approaching the Distal extremity of the Tibia, it runs distad and tibiad towards the Tarsus. Arriving at the Tarsus, it passes under the Ligament of the Tendons, and continues its direction towards the Interstice be- tween the Metatarsals of the Great Toe and the Index Pedis. Between these, it runs dislad and plantad, and at last, terminating on the Plantar aspect, inosculates with the branch called Planlaris JExternus. Before it passes to the Rotular aspect, it distributes branches to the Soleus, Tibialis Posticus, and the Cap- sular Ligament, on which last, they inosculate with the Azygous Articular, and the Disto-Articulars.

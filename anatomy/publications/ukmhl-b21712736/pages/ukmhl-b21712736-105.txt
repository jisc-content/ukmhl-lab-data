47 A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. but adjacent to the lateral parts of the Sella Turcica; and then, near the posterior clinoid process and Co- ronal part of the Tuber Annulare, communicates (p) (p) Cesserius was the first who gave a figure of this branch, and Willis the first who gave it a name'. The Arteria Sylviaiia is considered by Portal as its regular origin. Once he had seen it on the right side, entering the Basilar Artery, and says, that it sometimes enters the Vertebral. On comparing the two communicating branches, most Ana- tomists hare remarked that the one is often considerably larger than the other. This difference 1 have likewise ob- served, but have always been inclined to ascribe it partly to some difference in the force of the injection. A gentleman lately showed me a drawing, where both com- municating branches were wanting. He said, that injecting the Cephalic Arteries, none of the injection flowed into the Vertebrals, and that, afterwards injecting the Basilar Artery, none of it flowed into the Encephalics. Speaking of the communicating Artery, “ De l’Artere com- “ municante,” Portal observes, “ On donne ce nom a trois Ar- “ tferes qui reunissent celles du Cerveau.” But although his assertiou may be true, that this name has been given to the three Arteries, another assertion is equally true, that the name is absurd ; the three Arteries, which this name would insinuate to be only one, are three Arteries, all at some distance from one another; one of them connecting the two Cephalics through the medium of the two Arteriae Callosse; and the others connecting the two Cephalics with the two Vertebrals, through the two large branches of the Basilar Artery.

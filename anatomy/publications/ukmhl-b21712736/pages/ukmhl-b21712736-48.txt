XX INTRODUCTION. Genera, and Species (a.) But confining our views to the ramified systems of the human body, the charac- ters which distinguish their different orders, genera, and species, fall not within the plan of our inquiry. We have merely to select the characters of the spe- cies from the varieties that distinguish individuals. Thus, in comparing the arterial branches and rami- fications of many individuals, we have to examine all the appearances wherein they differ, and wherein they agree; wherein they agree often, and wherein seldom ; to distinguish what are regular from what are variable, what are peculiar from what are general, and then to fix on the regular and general as the characters of the species: Noting at the same time the nature and frequency of the exceptions from the general rule, but omitting entirely the uncertain and unimportant va- rieties that distinguish individuals, and which never can be objects of any description that is applicable to the species. By leaving as uncertain what is uncertain, and de- scribing as regular only what is regular, we should greatly facilitate the progress of Anatomy, relieve our (a) The rete mirabile of Galen, the rete mirabile of Hovius, the ramification of the humeral artery as in the Lemur, the ramifications of the mesenteric as in the Sow, and the ramifi- cations of the renal as in the Cat, are properly generic rami- fications.

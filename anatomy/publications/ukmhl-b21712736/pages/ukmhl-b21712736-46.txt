XVill INTRODUCTION. of its species, would he ever think of making refer- ences to all its peculiar branches and leaves, and accompany these references with verbal descriptions? If he did so, a pupil of Linnaeus would naturally suppose him fatuous or insane, or at least a most egregious insignificant trifler. So far as the difference of the cases will admit, might it not be worth the while of Anatomists to imi- tate the Naturalist in his mode of description. His objects of description in Botany and Zoology, are in- finitely more numerous and varied than those of An- atomy, and yet he describes them with so much pre- cision, that we seldom mistake the object which he means, and with so much conciseness, that we easily remember it; and what is more, recognise the object when we see it in nature, although we had never seen something more than the species of the disease, and something more than the species of the remedies usually recommended. To attempt the cure upon general information, would be to mistake the individual for the species; and a person labouring under such a mistake, would be likely to do more harm than good. In studying, however, individual distinctions, much care and discretion are also requisite ; for in such a pursuit, one may be apt to lose sight of the species, and, trusting to trifling unimportant distinctions, may regulate his practice by appearances and circumstances that have little connection with the species of the disease, or the species of bis patient.

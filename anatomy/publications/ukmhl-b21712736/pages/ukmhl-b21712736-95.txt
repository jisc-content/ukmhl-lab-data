37 A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. one of the Anterior Clinoid processes, there pene- trates coronad through the Dura Mater, bends a little iniad, and ultimately divides into two large branches (A), the one running in the Fossa Sylvii, and thence named the Arteria Sylvian a ; the other running a little glabellad, but afterwards bending coronad and iniad on that part of the hemisphere that lies in contact with the Falciform process of the Dura Mater, continues its course a little coronad of the Corpus Collosum, and observing nearly a similar direction, has thence been named the Arteria Callosa. Between its origin and the Foramen, it has sel- dom been observed to send off branches, though volitions and mental emotions, than in cases where the blood ebbs and flows as quick as thought. In all these cases, the nerves, too, must combine their effects with those of the Arteries, and so, among the nerves, we find that those dis- tributed to organs of voluntary motions, and those distributed to the organs of sense, for the purpose of clear and distinct per- ception, exhibit, in their course, generally fewer ganglions and plexuses, and, compared to the organs in which they terminate, are in proportion obviously larger, than those distributed to involuntary organs, or the organs of obscure indistinct sen- sation. (A) Quelquefois elle se divise en trois, en formant le tre- pied, lorsque communicant en sort an meme endroit; et en quatre, lorsque 1â€™Artere du plexus Choroide en tire aussi son origine dans ce lieu.

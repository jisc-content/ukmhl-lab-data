IV INTRODUCTION. pulmonic artery was called the Vena Arteriosa, or Arteria Venosa. ,In the same way, all the vessels connected with the left or systemic ventricle were considered as arteries ; and hence the pulmonary, or systemic veins, were regularly termed Arteriae Venosae, or Venae Arteriosae. These opinions gave rise to the expressions venous and arterial blood; the dark coloured blood being confined to what were called veins, and the florid to what were named arteries. After Harvey, however, had satisfactorily proved that the Vena arteriosa was actually an artery, and the Arteriae venosae actually veins in form and in function, it was obstinate and absurd, as De Back observes in his letter to Harvey, to call that Venous blood which flowed in arteries as well as in veins, or that Arterial blood which flowed in veins as well as in arteries. To accommodate our language to the immortal discovery of Harvey, I have proposed, in my No- menclature, to call the blood of the dark colour the Pulmonic Blood, as it all flows towards the pulmones, or lungs, and the blood of a florid red the Systemic Blood, as it all flows to the system at large. The Pulmonic system of sanguiferous vessels, will therefore consist of the veins and arteries that con- vey the dark coloured blood to the lungs: the Systemic system, of the veins and arteries that con-

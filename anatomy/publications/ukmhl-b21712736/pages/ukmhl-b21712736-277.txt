A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. 219 mentioned by Columbus, as the usual distribution (/i). Besides these branches from the Obturatoria, other branches from a different source, running on the con- fines of the Rectum and the Bladder, have been seen emerging under the Symphysis, and running along the Dorsum of the Penis. A Vesical branch, from what Haller calls the Middle Haemorrhoidal, is often continued along the Prostate into the Dorsal Artery of the Penis (i), the Hontense Externc of Winslow, the principal branch of the Pudic Artery, and some- (A) Haller, Fascic. p. 32.

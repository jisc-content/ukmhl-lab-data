INTRODUCTION. VI Ii all the blood flowing in the arteries were to return directly by the veins, and never to leave these circulating vessels, nothing would remain to the commencement of the two great arteries, were known to Galen ami,to Erasistratus, nay, are even mentioned, and ob- scurely described in that Treatise concerning the Heart, which, though erroneously, says Galen, ascribed to Hippocrates, is yet published in works. The valves in the veins of the extremities were seen and de- scribed by Jacobus Sylvius, were also described by Charles Stephans, under the name of Apophyses Venarum, and were afterwards seen, and more accurately described by the cele- brated Fabrieius of Aquapendente, under the name of Ostwla Venarum. But though all saw that these membranes might often retard, and sometimes arrest the current of the blood, as it flowed from the trunks to the branches of veins, or from the branches to the trunks of arteries, no one ever drew the con- clusion that they .acted regularly in the same manner, shut up the channels, and compelled the blood to flow uniformly in the same direction. ' The blood too, long before Harvey, had been known to pass through the vessels of the lungs from the right to the left ven- tricle of the heart, and this passage had been known to Galen, to Nemesius Bishop of Emessa, to Servetus a Spaniard, to Realdus Columbus, and to Andrew Caesalpinus. Nay, Andrew Cassalpinus had not only traced it from the right to the left ventricle of the heart, but from the left to the right again, and yet he saw nothing of the circulation discovered by Harvey. With him, the blood was still made to flow backwards and

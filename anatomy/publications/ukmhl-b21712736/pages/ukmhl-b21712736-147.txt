A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. 89 The branches which it regularly sends off, are cer- tain branches named Arteries Thoraciccc, and a large branch named Scapularus (/). As for other two branches, usually called Circumflexes Humeri, though regular in their general course and destination, they are not so constantly from the Axillary Portion as> the common descriptions would lead us to suppose. ARTERI.-E THORACIC.E. In general, these Arteries are meant to include all the branches from the Axillary Portion, except the Scapularis and the two Circumflexes. In their ra- mifications, they extend from the Deltoid and Sub- scapular muscles, as far as the Sternum, and from the Clavicle to the fifth rib. Towards the Clavicle and Acromion Process, where they spread on the Deltoid and Subclavian muscles, they inosculate with branches from the Subclavian portion of the Brachial. They supply copiously the Pectorales, the Serratus Magnus, and often the Subscapularis, and in the in- terstices between the ribs, communicate with branch- es from the Intercostals and the Sternal Artery, and with other branches of the Sternal Artery in the substance of the Mammae. They sometimes arise (t) Subscapularis, Infiascapularis, or Inferior ScapulÂ®.

A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. margin of the Popliteus. In the fifth plate of the fifth Fasciculus of the learned Haller, the larger di, vision of the Femoro-Popliteal Portion of the Crural mns distacl a considerable way on the Popliteal aspect of the Leg, and then divides into two branch- es of very nearly an equal magnitude; one continu- ing the course of the Trunk on the same aspect, as a Peroneal Artery; the other perforating the Inter- osseous Ligament, to assume the place and perform the office of the Tibialis Antica. If the common Trunk in this case were to be viewed as the proper Trunk of the Peroneal Artery, the Tibialis Antica might be said to be wanting, and its place supplied by a perforating branch from the Peroneal, distinct, however, from the perforating branch that passes through the Ligament near its Distal extremity, and which by Haller has been honoured with the title of Peronea Antica. TIBIALIS POSTICA Huns distad on the Leg under the Soleus, adja- cent to the course of the Tibial Nerve, and, at the sinuosity of the Os Calcis, generally divides into two branches denominated Plantar, and distinguish- ed by the epithets External and Internal.

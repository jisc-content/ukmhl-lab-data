A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. 279 an observer of nature, lias only to answer that it does not: He who conducts the operations of na- ture, can best reply to the question why ? But admitting with Mayow, that the primary and essential use of the Lungs is to transmit the Nitrum Aereum into the system, yet in those cases where the whole of the blood is circulated through them, it does not follow, that because their motions of in- spiration and of exspiration are at longer intervals than the Diastole and Systole of the Heart, that they therefore are not necessary to the circulation. Admitting, even on the older hypothesis of respira- tion, that it rather takes from, than gives to the blood, and that the Placenta is equally capable of of- ficiating as Lungs in the one capacity, as well as in the other., still it must be allowed, that not only the Placenta, but Umbilical Cord have also a dif- ferent function to perforin. They are the vehicles by which nourishment is partly prepared and conveyed to the Foetus. Previous to birth, the Uterus is employ- ed to furnish that nourishment; but after birth in the class of Mammalia, the Mammae are made to suc- ceed to the office; while the organs of digestion, and the Lacteal Absorbents, are made to succeed the Placenta and the Cord in preparing and conveying it to the Vascular System. This last office of the Placenta scarcely accords with any of the functions ascribed to the Lungs.

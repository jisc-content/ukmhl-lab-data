117 A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. H 2 The cases are rare, and extremely rare, where it passes, obliquely across the Radius, and peripherad of the Fascia, to that place between the Metacarpals from which it afterwards penetrates to the Vola. So common trunk of the Ulnar and Interosseal, “ with the Fascia, and if it be stated, that almost invariably when the Ulnar Ar- tery,” i. e. the Ulnar, strictly so called, “ originates high, it de- scends above the Fascia ; we shall be enabled to explain some phenomena, which are sometimes seen when the Brachial ves- sels are wounded. The fact of both vessels lying beneath the Fascia, when the Radial Artery rises high, and the Ulnar,” i. e. the Ulnar, strictly so called, “ when it comes off high, running more superfical than the Fascia, are points highly necessary to be kept in recollection.”—Burns’ Varieties of the Larger Ar- teries. In short, Mr. Burns always found the Radial Artery, and the common trunk of the Ulnar and Interosseal, covered by the Fascia; but the Ulnar, strictly so called, often above the Fas- cia. The language of Andreas Laurentius, who speaks of the high division of the Humeral Artery, which he calls the Basilic, and of the Radial Artery, as being its subcutaneous branch, implies nothing that is clear or precise, as to the course of the Radial Artery. “ Basilicam etiam duplieem observamus “ profundam et subcutaneam : Utraque varios ex se diffundit “ Rivos; est tamen subcutanem surculus quidam, in Carpo “ conspicuus, quo loco pulsuum differentias, adrnota manu, “explorare solemus.”—Hist. Anal. Lib. iv. Cap. x. The pas- sage quoted from Elias F. Heister, by Haller, and where it is said, that the Radial Artery runs dislurl upon the external side of the Biceps, determines as little with respect to the question, whether did it run peripherad or ccvtrad of the Humeral Fascia ?

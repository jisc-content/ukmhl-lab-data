A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. 129 Artery beneath the Aponeurosis Palmaris, and com- pletes the arch from which these Volar branches originate. In a third class, the Ulnar Artery turns but a little to the Radial aspect, under the Aponeurosis Palmaris, where the Thenal branch, from the Radial Artery, inosculates with it, and forms an a,rch, from which is derived only a part of these Volar Arteries, the place of the rest being supplied by a branch or branches from the Radial Artery, as it is passing from the Anconal to the Thenal aspect. In a fourth class, the Ulnar Artery, without any Thenal branch from the Radial, sends off a part of the Volar branches, while a branch, or branches, from the Radial Artery, as it is passing from the Anconal to the Thenal aspect, supplies the deficiency. In a fifth class, the Great Interosseal, descending under the Ligament of the Carpus, is observed to give off Volar branches that, in other cases, are oc- casionally supplied by those branches of the Radial Artery, which it gives off, as it is passing from the Anconal to the Thenal aspect. In a sixth class, the Radial, Ulnar, and Interosseal Arteries, inosculate freely beneath the Aponeurosis Palmaris, and, after uniting, send off the different Volar branches. In a seventh class, of which I have only seen one specimen, that belongs to Dr. Monro, jun. and of

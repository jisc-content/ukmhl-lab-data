Its course is poplitead, close to the Uiacus Interims and Psoas, and between the Acetabulum and Trochanter Minor, where it divides into several branches, one continued between the Adductor Magnus and Quad- ratus, and then reflected under the Quadratus to- wards the Gemelli. Between its origin, and this ex- tent of its ramification, branches are distributed to the parts adjacent, to the Psoas, Iliacus Interims, and Peetineus, to the Scrotum in males, to the Labia in females, to the heads of the Triceps (in), the Obturator Externus, the Capsule of the joint, to the Acetabu- lum, the Trochanter Major, and Tuberosity of the Ischium, to the Semi-tendinosus, the Semi-mem- branosus, and to the long head of the Biceps. Towards the Scrotum, it inosculates with the Pudics; near the Acetabulum, upon the Obturator, and heads of the Triceps, with the Obturatoria ; near the Ramus of the Ischium, with transverse branches from the Haemorrhoidals; near the Quad- ratus and the Gemelli, with branches proceeding from the Gluteal, the Ischiadic, and the Pelvien Pudic; near the Trochanter, with perforating branch- (m) The Adductor Brevis, Longus, and Magnus, when viewed as one muscle, are named the Triceps Adductor Femoris.

105 A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. Ulnar side of the Biceps; the Ulnar, also, and Inter- osseal, when they rise high, regularly continue on the same side. Nay, even the Radial, when it rises high, seldom, if ever, crosses the Biceps, till that muscle sends off the Tendinous Aponeurosis, which generally, if not always, protects this Artery, as it passes obliquely to its own side. Whatever be the branch, also, of the fore-arm, that is sent off in the region of the Humerus, it is never separated far from the Trunk. Of the three, however, the Ulnar, from its running occasionally peripherad of the Fascia, is that which admits of separation to the greatest distance. The separated branches run parallel, or nearly parallel, to the course of the Trunk, as far as the Distal extremity of the Hu- the arm, 1 cannot be certain whether it run above or below the Fascia. From its giving off none but Cutaneous ramifications, I believe it was placed above the Fascia.” The following case, quoted by Soemmerring from Hilde- brandt, is so vaguely described, that I scarcely know to which of the three kinds of division it belongs. “ G. F. Hildebrandt “ Rainum Arteriac Brachial is invenit, qui in superficie pro- “ cedens in Arteriam Kadialem et Ulnarem dividebatur, quae “pari mode in Antibracliio superfkiem tenebant, truncus “ autein Arteriae Brachialis abibat in Arteriam lnterosseam “ sol,to crussiorem.” In this case, did the three Arteries of the fore-arm arise together, or did one of them arise separately, and tbe trunk afterwards divide into the other two, or if it di- vided into the other two, into which two did it divide ?

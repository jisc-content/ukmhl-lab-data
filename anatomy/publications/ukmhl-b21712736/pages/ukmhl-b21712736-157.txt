A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. 99 Artery, along with varieties of ramification which he had observed at different times, and in different subjects, and from which lie had formed that ideal combination, which the Figure represents. His ho- nest and manly declaration of the motives by which he was actuated, in constructing that Figure, should exempt him from censure ; but in what manner shall we vindicate those, who, not looking beyond the Figure, have servilely described his ideal combina- tion at the time they were pretending to be copying which, after running-in a parallel direction, enters the Humeral Artery again, or some of its branches, near the bend of the arm. In four preparations, that are now before me, this branch enters the Radial Artery; in three of them, opposite to the bend of the arm ; in the fourth, some inches beyond it. In one, where it enters at the bend of the arm, it is as large from its very commencement, as the Radial Artery, while the part of the Radial, interposed between it and the Humeral Ar- tery, appears as it were a transverse branch, joining a Radial and Humeral Artery, that had previously separated, near the Axilla. Mr. Bums calls these branches Vasa Aberrantia, and has five preparations in which they occur. (See his Varieties Of the Larger Arteries.) The first Dr. Monro has delineated one in the second volume of the Edinburgh Medical Essays; and Haller, after speaking of such a branch, says, “ Aliquid “ huic fabricae simile pingit Alexander Monrous in Edinburg, “Ess.

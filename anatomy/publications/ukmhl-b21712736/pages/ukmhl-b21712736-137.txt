A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. 7Q Approaching the Cartilage of the sixth rib, the Sternal Artery sends off a large lateral branch, which, crossing the Cartilages of the false ribs, and coasting along the attachments of the Diaphragm, as far as the tenth, has received the name of Mus- culo-Phraiic. At each of the Interstices, which are here narrower, the Musculo-Phrenic sends off the branches that meet the divisions of the Intercostals on the Sacral and Atlantal margins of the ribs, and as these inosculate by their extremities with the di- visions of the Intercostals, without changing the di- rection of their course, and without any sudden change of diameter, it is difficult to say where- the inosculations take place. The Musculo-Phrenic, from its situation, naturally sends numerous branches to the Diaphragm, and, though not so numerous, nor yet so large, branches also to the Transversus Abdominis, which sometimes have been seen extending sacrad, and inosculating with branches from the Lumbar Arteries. “ lactes, et cette experience a ete dcpuis faite plusieurs fois. “ D’ailleurs, n’y a-t-il pas des femmes qui rendent du sang “ par la mamelle au lieu de lait? On en a vu qui etoieut “ reglees par cette voie.”—Portal. Vide Nuck’s Adenogra- phiae Curiosae, cap. 11. where he mentions the experiments, in which he made his injections pass not only from the Arteries into the Lactiferous Ducts, but from the Lactiferous Ducts into the Arteries.

183 A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. Cocliac; the next to the transverse and right Colon, and then come the branches distributed to the Je- junum and Ileum. The course of the Trunk, and the mode in which it gives out these branches, have generally a dis- tinct and permanent character. Proceeding from its orisin, it runs first dextrad and sacrad behind the Pancreas ; emerges next from beneath the margin of that Gland ; passes sternad, and within the dupli- cature of the Mesocolon, over the last flexure of the Duodenum ; enters now the duplicature of the Me- sentery, and here in future regulates its course by the direction of the Dorsal attachments of that membrane, by its inclination towards the Viscera, and by the general contour of the line, where its laminae separate to form their peritoneal coat. From this course follows a curve, whose convexity points sinistrad and sternad, and whose further extremity, accompanying the Ileum to its termination, unites with a branch of the right Colon, and constitutes a kind of Vascular arch, situated in the right Iliac re- gion. From the convexity of this curve, or from the side on which this convexity is situated, proceed in general all its branches, excepting sometimes a branch or branches to the right Colon from the concave side, and a branch to the transverse Colon on the left, which sometimes proceeds neither from

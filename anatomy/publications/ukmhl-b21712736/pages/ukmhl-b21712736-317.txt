A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. 25f> 0 this Tibialis, by running a little nearer to the Fibula, approaches in its character still nearer to the Ulnar. This occasional branch called Peronea, that runs dislad by the side of the Fibula as far as the Tar- sus, arising sometimes from the Tibialis, that cor- responds with the Radial Artery, but more fre- quently from the Tibialis, that corresponds with the Ulnar Artery, has evidently man}' of those charac- ters that belong to the Interosseal of the fore-arm. The Interosseal sometimes arising from the Humeral Artery along with the Radial, but more frequently from the Humeral Artery along with the Ulnar, al- ways sends off perforating branches through the In- terosseous Ligament; generally distributes its ulti- mate branches in the region of the Carpus ; occasion- ally assumes the size of the Radial and Ulnar Ar- teries, and sends off Volax and Digital branches, which are all characters, making allowances for dif- ference of circumstance, belonging to this Artery of the Leg. two last are respectively larger in Moles and in Frogs; respec- tively smaller in the Cow and the Horse j while the Fibula is wanting in the Deer and the Goat, and the Ulna, if united by ossification, only a kind of process to the Radius, as the Fibula, when present, is in many species nothing more than a process of the Tibia.

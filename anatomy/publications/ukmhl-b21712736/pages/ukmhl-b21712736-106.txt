A description of the arteries 48 with one of the larger branches of the Basilar Artery, soon after that branch originates from its trunk. By this, and its fellow of the opposite side, a very free communication is formed between the Encephal.c and Vertebral Arteries, and as the two Artena; Calosse, also communicate by one or two transverse branches, or, as I once saw, by forming together a common trunk that afterwards divided like the Basi- lar Artery, a communication equally free, is o - served between the two Encephalics. By these in- osculations, an area is seen on the base of the Cere- brum encompassed by a chain of communicating ves- sels, within which chain are seen the Infundibulum, the Optic nerves, and the Mammillary Eminences, and which, as resting on the base of the Cranium, seems also to encompass a great part of t e e a Turcica. This chain of vessels is usually named the circle of Willis, although it is never of a circular form, but always quadrangular, and even the quad- rangular form itself differing widely in different in- dividuals. From its situation, it naturally sen s branches to the Infundibulum, the Optic nerves he Mammillary Eminencies, the Crura Cerebri and the basilar extremity of the Plexus Choroides, when that extremity is not otherwise supplied.

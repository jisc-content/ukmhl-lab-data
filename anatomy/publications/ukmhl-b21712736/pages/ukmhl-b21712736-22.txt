PREFACE. XVI of particular facts from which it commences (f). The plates of Albinus, instead of inducing the Anatomist to read his work Dc.Scelcto Humano, and his work entitled Historia Musculorum, have been the means of suffering them to fall into almost total neglect and oblivion. Little surely did Albinus imagine, that, after publishing his Historia Musculorum, the at- tachment of the Obliquus Externus to the Spine of the Pubis (g), or the compression of the Urethra, by the muscles called Comprcssores Prostatas, would have ever been considered as the discoveries of later times ; and less surely might Haller have imagined, when he combated the opinion that the high divi- sion of the Humeral Artery was not the most com- mon, that his learned annotations would have been forgotten, and his plates quoted, not half a century (f) “ Ex sensu permanet sensatum; ex permanentia sensati a fit memoria; ex multiplici memoria, experientia; ab ex- “ perientia, ratio universalis, definitiones, et maxima, sive “ axiomata communia, cognitionis certissima principia.”— Harveius, Prirfat. ad Exercit. de General. Animalium. (g) After describing one of the Tendons, by which the Ob- liques attaches itself to the Os Pubis of the opposite side, he observes, that with the other “ Se inserit tuberculo quod 6 su- “ periore eademque priore parte Ossis Pubis eminet; proximee ■ “ que Spinee quae ab ejus tuberculi latere externo est.” This last attachment is now denominated the Ligament of Gimbcmat, as if it had been unknown before.

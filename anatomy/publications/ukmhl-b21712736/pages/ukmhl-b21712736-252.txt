Descending afterwards to their ultimate destinations, the primary Arteries naturally inoscu- late with-the branches in their course, as with branch- es fiom the Lumbar, the Iliac, Hypogastric, and Epi- gastric Arteries; and when it happens that the Pri- mary Arteries are obliterated or obstructed, a com- municating branch, or communicating branches, na- turally succeed in performing their functions.

One or two deriving their origin from the Aorta, and the other, or others^ either from a Renal or Capsular branch, or from some other Artery that lies contiguous to the usual course. When they rise high, they have been seen giving branches to the Pancreas, and the Dextral some branches to the Liverthey have also been seen giving out branches to the Duodenum, and generally blanches to the adipose substance surrounding the kidnies ; to the Ureters, and to the Lumbar Glands ; branches that inosculate on the left side with some branches near the Parietes from the smaller Me- senteric ; and branches on the right side that in- osculate with branches of the larger Mesenteric at the Caput Caecum.

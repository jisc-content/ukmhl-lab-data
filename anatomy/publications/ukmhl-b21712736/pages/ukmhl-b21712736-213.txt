155 A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. more of the Costal interstices; according as the nlunber of the pairs of Ribs are more or fewer than twelve, which but rarely happens; or according as each Intercostal space (m), on which they are ramified, is supplied by a separate Intercostal Ar- tery, and not two of them supplied, a circumstance which very seldom occurs by a common trunk (re). (m) A difference likewise arises in the number, from Ana- tomists annexing different ideas to the term Intercostal, as ap- plied to Arteries. According to Haller, this term is applicable only to those Arteries that run in the Intercostal spaces; and therefore the last of his Intercostal arteries, is that which fol- lows the sacral margin of the eleventh rib. “ Intercostalis “ Aurtica nona et mtima est, quae sub undecima costa de- “ currit.”—Fascic. tmi. p. 69. According to Boyer and others, the last Intercostal Artery is that which follows the Sacral margin of the twelfth or last rib. “ La demi&re Iutereostale “ suit le bord Inferieure de la derm£re Cote.” This Artery of Boyer might properly enough be termed a Costal Artery ; but has certainly no title to the epithet Intercostal. It is the first Lumbar Artery of Haller.

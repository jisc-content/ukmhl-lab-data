91 A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. these ai bitrary limitations of number, several branches from the Axillary Portion are left without a class, and without a name. Though without a name, they ought to have been left; as names and descriptions, untying general and permanent characters, where none are to be found, are the sources of error, but never of any important information. The learned Portal, declining either to specify the number, or assign names to these varying and ir- regular branches, has chosen to divide them into three classes: the Anterior, the Middle, and the Posterior. His. method is preferable to the one in use, but his terms denoting position are vague, and he does not seem to place that confidence on the ac- curacy of his own classification, that might have been expected ; for what he calls the Posterior Tho- racics, are among the branches which he afterwards c^lls the Superior Scapulars, and sometimes the Small Internal Scup.dars (0). In all the accounts rrV^6 ^ emP'0yed t0 COnvey a" indefinite number of mdefimte meanings, may, in one respect, be classed the words that convey no meaning at all. „ ,(<>) “ U‘S Art^reS 'rhora(,hiques Posterieures, sortent de !Vx- et Intenrnre de I’.nere Axillaire, et se .« ^ ‘ daus le muscle bous-.Scapulaire, en deux on ,ro,s « d,,X’ qUe, ' T aPPent‘ qUe,q0f fois '**/*«« S'ujwtures ernes,pour les dnrtinguer e agrande .capture Extern*. a

INTRODUCTION. XXIX ing Arteries, is either of the same, or very nearly of the same qualities, the origin of an Artery, from which the s ipply of blood is received, is of very little con- sequence to the organ; of so little, in fact, that the same organ is frequently supplied by branches pro- ceding from different trunks. For the sake, indeed, of surgical operations, it were to be wished, that the origins and ramifications of Arteries were more regular than they are. But the general law here prescribed by the Author of Nature, seems evident- ly this, that every part shall have a supply suited to its functions, from the nearest or most convenient sources, as circumstances will admit. And that if vessels from the usual sources be deficient or wanting, ow- ing to disease, accident, habit, or primary formation, other vessels from different sources, and in different situations, shall always be in readiness to assume their office, and to furnish the supply of blood that is requisite.

A description op the arteries. branches proximad of the Knee, are named the Su- perw/- Articular branches, and two others distad of the Knee, the Inferior Articular. To these, if we add an Azygos Articular, Two Branches entering the Gastrocnemius Externâ„¢, and the Two Large Cnemial Arteries, into which it divides beyond the Popliteus, we enumerate all the usual branches ascribed by Anatomists to this Portion of the Crural Artery. proximo-articulares, or, Articulares Superiors Externa et Interna. The two Superior or Proximo-Articulars, cir- cumflected proximad of the two Condyles, distribute their branches through and under the two Vasti to the Rotular aspect, and form a part of the Vascular Plexus that is spread upon and round the Patella in the region of the Knee Joint. In forming this Plexus, they inosculate in their course with branches from the two Disto-Articulars, and the Azygos Articular; the one turning round by the Tibial side, with branches from the Anastomotic, and with perforat- ing branches from the Tibio-Femoral Portion of the Ci ural; and the other turning round by the lbular side, with branches proceeding from the Smaller Circumflex.

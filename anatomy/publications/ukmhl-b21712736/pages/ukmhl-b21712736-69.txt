A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. 11 the Cranium, and the Pericephalic ramified chiefly on the parts Without. Through most of their course, they are found con- nected by Cellular membrane, with the Internal Ju- gular Veins seen on their Lateral and Sternal aspects, the eight pair of Nerves on their Lateral and Dorsal, and the Great Symphathetics on their Dorsal aspect, the muscles interposed between them and the cutis, being the two Latissimi Colli, the Sternomastoidei, the Omohyeidei, the Sternothyroidei, and Sterno- hyoidei, although none of these muscles intervene throughout, excepting the two Latissimi Colli. Their two branches, the Encephalic and the Pe- ricephalic, have long been observed by many Ana- tomists to be of different proportional magnitudes, according to the different periods of life, and the truth seems to be, that they vary their size with the magnitudes of the parts on which they are ramified. Tlie Encephalic is, in general, propor- tionally larger in the Foetus, as the Brain of the Foetus is proportionally larger than that of the Adult. But another cause occasionally combines in varying the proportion. The Superior Thyroid often rises as the third branch of the Cephalic ; and though this branch be often proportionally larger in the Foetus, yet, at all times, by rising either from the Encepha- lic, or the Pericephalic, it determines the mag- nitude to be greatest on the side on which it pre- ponderates.

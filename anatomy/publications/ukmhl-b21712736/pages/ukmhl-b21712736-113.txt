A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. 55 of nature. Yet, unfortunately, Haller has, in his scheme, been more or less followed by all the dif* ferent writers of systems, from Sabatier downwards, all of them either copying from him, or from one an- other (t), though occasionally introducing a little of their own in matter or manner, to give their de- scriptions something like a dash of originality. But, without the aid of any of these artificial combinations, a more natural way to convey an idea of this Artery, and its ramifications, is to follow it through every part of its course, and describing its character, to mention the places where, in general, it is uniform, and where it is variable, as to its re- lative size and position, the number, origin, and dis- tribution of its branches. On no account, must we think of treating it as the tyrant Procrustes treated his guests, who, by stretching the short, and am- putating the tall, made them all commensurate to the size of his bed. In short, the Artery must dic- tate to us, and not we to the Artery, what is to be the proper description. To the common practice of describing, under se- parate heads, its Subclavian, Axillary, and Humeral (/) We can hardly believe, that, in copying from nature, they could have observed the very combinations that he had projected, and which never had been seen in nature before.

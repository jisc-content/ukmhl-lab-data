A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. 165 K 2 Spermatic, the Capsular, the Adipose, the Ure- teric, and the Lumbar. Of these, the Cceliac and the two Mesenteric are always single; the Phrenic, the Renal, and the Spermatic, generally in single pairs ; the Lumbar in five or in six pairs ; the Capsular, Adipose, and Ureteric, also in pairs; but the number indefinite, and the origins various. ARTERIiE PHRENIC.*. These are the Arteries that, rising directly, or indirectly, from the Abdominal part of the Aorta, are ramified on the concave side of the Diaphragm, and which, advancing from the Mesial Plane at its Dorsal aspect, extend their branches sterna,i and later ad, till they meet with branches from the Ster- nal Arteries and the Intercostals. M hen two of them arise by a common trunk, that trunk is either from the Coeliac, or from the Aorta ■ when they rise separately, both are from the Cceliac (c), or from the Aorta ; or one from the Coeliac, and (r) Haller observed that the Phrenic branches arose more frequently from the Coeliac Artery than from the Aorta P|lre- “ mcae.

Mayow, who believed that the Lungs were in- tended to convey Oxygen, or what he called the JNitrum Aereum, into the blood to supply and dif- fuse the animal spirits, and to support muscular mo- tion (y), was doubtful whether the action of the „ (,J) “ Vlta> fallor in spin'tium animalium distributione „ C0!>SlStV qUlbUS SUpplendis> cord“ Pulsatione, sanguinisque , ad cerebrum affluxu opus est: et Videtur respirationem ad coi IS motmn, modo alibi dicendo, pracipue conducere.

Mayow, having persuaded himself that his Nitro-Aerial par- ticles, by mixing with the blood, were the primary cause of ir- ntabdity and muscular motion, next tried to explain how these motions, by causing agitation, collision, friction, and effer- vescence between the Nitro-Aerial particles and certain Salino- Sulphunc particles, produced likewise animal heat.

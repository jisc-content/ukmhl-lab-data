188 A description of the arteries. enumerated among those that are termed Hcemorr- hoidal. The extreme vessels of the two Mesenteries, where they scarcely are visible to the naked eye, have been traced by the assistance of the micro- scope, penetrating centrad through the nervous coat, and exhibiting beautiful retiform textures upon the villous or internal coat. The honour of tracing them is due to the patience and industry of Liberkuhn. By aqueous injections, it has also been shown that they open by numerous exhalant vessels upon the concave surface of the Tube, which, in the morbid states of the Viscera, accounts for the fre- quent and copious discharges of fecal matter, that cannot be ascribed to the previous ingesta (?â€¢), O') In restoring the Stomach and the Intestines to their na- tural functions, much of the utility of purgative medicines may consist in removing the morbid and noxious matter, thus exhaled from the internal coat of the Intestine. The advan- tages resulting from the use of purgatives have been partially known from the earliest periods in the history of Physic. A clear, extensive, and systematic view of their utility, of the diseases to which they are applicable, and the various cir- cumstances by which their exhibition ought to be regulated, was first given by Dr. Hamilton, Sen. of Edinburgh, Senior Phy- sician to the Royal Infirmary. His work contains a summary view of his observations in extensive practice for more than a period of thirty years, and is certainly a novelty amidst a number of the Medical product.ons of the present day, which are pub-

INTRODUCTION. xxvii c 2 Anastomotic ; and some ever, from a false hypothesis, as the Aorta, Carotids, and Ranina. With the names of the Arteries, I shall take few liberties, except where they lead to ambiguity or error; or where a change would simplify and improve the language of description. When they are named from their destination, or from the organs on which they are ramified, they and the organs, when the change can be made without much innovation, should always have their names from the same language. For instance, the names of the principal muscles attached to the tongue, have an al- lusion to its Greek name Glossa; while the name of the Artery has an allusion to its Latin name Lingua. It would have been better had the same epithet which distinguishes the muscles, and a pair of the nerves belonging to the tongue, been also made to distinguish the Artery. The parts of Arteries should never be described under separate heads, as if they were whole or entire Arteries; what we denominate the Subclavian, the Axillary, and the Humeral Arteries, are but different parts of the same trunk; and what we denominate the common Iliac, the external Iliac, the common Femoral, the superficial Femoral, the Popliteal, and Posterior Tibial, are different portions of another trunk. It is surely absurd, that these different parts should each have a name ; and yet, that the wholes of which they are parts should have no names. Where

But a mind of that description was wanting ; those minds that happened to observe them were feeble, un- steady. and fettered by hypotheses, and every new fact re- ceived au explanation suited to the prejudices which they had imbibed. The facts therefore which were previously known, and pre- viously explained on false hypotheses, were so far from being au assistance to Harvey in making his discovery, that they had all been previously enlisted to support the doctrine of natural, animal, and vital spirits j a doctrine which required two kinds of blood, one from each ventricle of the heart, and which were to meet in the cavities of the Cranium, Thorax, and Abdomen, and then to return, by the way that they went, back to the heart’ for a new supply of what was necessary to continue the forma- tion of the three spirits ; which three spirits were three imagi- nary instruments of Galen, under the direction of the three .Fa- culties, which he had substituted for the three Souls of Plato.

The term Gastric, in a general sense, is equally applicable to all the branches ramified on the Sto- mach ; but is usually restricted to the branches that enter at the concave arch, where the Gastro- hepatic Epiploon is attached. These branches, whether they arise near the confines of the Stomach from a common trunk, whether at a distance from different sources, or whether they be two or more in number, are seen extending, on the concave part of the Gastric arch, sinistrad towards the Cardia, and dextrad towards the Pylorus and the Duodenum. As they advance in these opposite directions, they send Ramuli from one of their sides to the smaller Epiploon, named Gastro-hepatic, and from the other, branches that spread on the Sternal and Dorsal aspects of the Stomach, continuing their course to the convex part of the Gastric arch, till they meet with branches from the Vasa Brevia, and from the two Gastro-epiploics, furnished by the Splenic and Hc-patic Arteries In this distribution, the branches sinistrad towards the Cardia, naturally inosculate with the last CEsophagcals and Ramuli of the Phrenics ; while the branches dextrad towards the Pylorus, if they do not extend their ramifications upon the Duodenum, and head of the Pancreas, as K 6

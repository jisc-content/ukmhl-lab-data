A DESCRIPTION OP THE ARTERIES. 12 ARTERIA PERICEPHALICA, seu Carolis Exlerna. This Artery; at its commencement more slemad and mesiad than the Encephalic, is soon afterwards observed to cross it in a lateral direction, following a course atlantad and dorsad, beneath the angle of the Basilar Maxilla, and under the Biventer, and Sty- lohyoideus, towards the seat of the Parotid Gland. Proceeding afterwards through that Gland, till it reaches the neck of the Condyloid Process of the Basi- lar Maxilla, it at last divides into two branches, that are named theTEMPORAL and Internal Maxillary, having previously sent off, separately, or in trunks common to two, the Atlantal, or Superior Thy- roid, the Lingual, the Pharyngeal, the Labial, the Occipital, and Auricular (Â£) branches. (A) The order in which these branches are named, is gene- rally the order in which they are observed to rise from the trunk, although the laws which regulate these appearances, seem not to be very rigid or defined. In one preparation belong- ing to Mr. Bums, the trunk itself is a short stem, from the end of which, its branches diverge like Radii from a centre. In an- other, which has been mentioned already, all these branches arise directly from the Cephalic. At the same time, it must be confessed, that such deviations are extremely rare, as Haller, who examined the Arteries of the Neck, in fifty bodies, and has also been particularly minute in his remarks, has never taken notice of any such anomalies.

66 A DESCRIPTION OP THE ARTERIES. Superior Cerebellar Branches. Towards the further extremity of the Tuber, one or more (g) branches from the opposite sides of the Basilar Artery, are reflected by the sides of the Crura Cerebri, from their Basilar to their Coronal aspect, and reflected, consequently, in that angular space between the Crura Cerebelli and Cerebri, where these first meet in the Tuber Annulare; these branches are also ramified on the Cerebellum, and known by the name of Snperiores Cerebelli-. In their course, they send branches to the Crura Cerebri and Crura Cerebelli; branches to the Choroid Plexus, lying on the Thalami, to the Corpora Quadri- gemina, the Pineal Gland, the Valve of Vieussenius, and the fourth Ventricle, and, like the preceding, are afterwards extensively ramified on the neigh- bouring surfaces of the Cerebellum. Posterior, or Deep Cerebral Branches. A little onward, beyond the origin of the third pair of nerves, the Basilar Artery ultimately divides into two branches, which, after communicating with (g) “ Non rarum est pro uno ejusmodi ramo, (sc. Arteria “ Superiore Cerebelli) duos tresve sibi parallelos similesque “ fuisse, ut tune quidem, quos nos l'ames (ejus truuci) dicemtis, “ ii diversi trunci sint.”—Haller.

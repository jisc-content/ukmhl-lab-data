In cases where this Artery is obstructed, originally deficient, or much exhausted by its previous branch- os, the Corpora Cavernosa, and the Dorsum of the Penis, receive a supply from neighbouring branches. Haller observed a Vesical branch from the Obtura- toria passing under the Symphysis Pubis, and in- osculating with the Pudic branches of the Penis (g).

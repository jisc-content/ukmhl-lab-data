A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. 161 Dorsi, the Semispinalis, the Longissimus Dorsi, and the Sacrolumbalis; as also upon the Latissimus Dorsi, the Trapezius and Rhomboidius, where these are adjacent. From this Dorsal branch, or directly from theTrunk â€¢f the Intercostal, a branch is sent to the neighbour- the Dorsal branches, near the angles of the Ribs, yet through the whole progress of their course they receive supplies from many other branches that run peripherad from the Primary Trunk. Thus, on comparing the descriptions given of the Intercostal* by different authors, we find that the same terms are employed to denote very different branches; the Superior Intercostal branch of Haller, is the continuation of the Trunk; the Su- perior Intercostal of Murray, one of the Kxtemal Intercostals of Ruysch ; the Inferior Intercostal of Haller, a small branch not observed by Ruysch, commencing near the angle of the Ribs, and following the Atlantal margin of the Rib that is situated sacrad ; the Inferior Intercostal of Murray, the con- tinuation of the Trunk ; the Inferior Intercostal of Boyer and others, the branch that occasionally separates from the Trunk, near the Sternal aspect, and, like the inferior at the Vertebral extremity, runs on the opposite side of the interstice as pictured by Ruysch. This singular confusion of language has partly arisen from the hurry of compilers not having patience to investigate the structure, nor to understand the meaning of the authors from whom they were copying; and partly too from thinking themselves always bound to describe whatever had been described by others, whether acquainted with the subject or not.

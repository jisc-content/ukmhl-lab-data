It i. found of d;c. ere,H proport,ona! lengths, as it originates proxim,d ° J “ad “ lhe rcSi0" °f the Femur, and likewise of different proportional diameters, as it gives off more or fewer than the ordinary branches. From what- eve, part of the Crural it arises, it runs distai and pophlead towards the part of the Linea Aspera I7ef! ’\AddUCt0r B,evis is inerted, and where pa. t of the \ astus Inlernus.originates. Soon after, an generally at the Interstice between the Adductor levis and Longue, though sometimes later, and sometimes earlier, it crosses obliquely the Linea spera, and ,s seen distributing its ultimate branch- es to the Flexor muscles that constitute the Ham- strings. In the progress of its course, it sends branches to llie \ astus Interims, that occasionally extend to the Crureus; branches to the Triceps; and one or more perforating branches, which, like the continuation of f16 T;Unk' that is described as the last of its ranches, cross obliquely the Linea Aspera to the Semi-mem branosus, the Semi-tendinosus, and the iceps Ci uris. These branches send off others of considerable size that, as Circumflex branches, turn round close to the Femur from the Popliteal to the ular aspect, where they are ramified on the Vas- tns 'xtennis, or the Vastus Externus and Gluteus j agnus. The perforating branches, whatever be

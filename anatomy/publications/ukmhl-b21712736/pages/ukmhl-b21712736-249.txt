A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. Jt)l eording to Eustachius or Haller, usually greater on the left side than upon the right (v). They divide into branches sometimes upon their entering the Kidnies; sometimes before they enter the sinuses ; and sometimes very near to the place of their origin from the Aorta. At other times, though by no means frequently, these branches arise in the form of Trunks by separate origins, to (the number of three, four, or five; some arising from the Aorta, nearly as high as the Mesocolon ; some from the angle of its division ; some again from the common Iliac; and, in rare cases, from the Hypogastric (tv). After entering the kidnies, some of them are seen, though only occasionally, inosculating by arches, as they diverge from the centre peripherad. Their divisions increase rapidly in number, and are generally so minute in the cor- tical substance, that many refuse to admit the in- jection ; while the injection of those that admit it.

Raro duae, tres, quatuor, aut quinque de- 11 prehenduntur.” Soemmernng. But see Haller, Fascic. iii. p. 59. (to) See Haller, Fascic. iii. p. 58 and 59. See also Eustach.

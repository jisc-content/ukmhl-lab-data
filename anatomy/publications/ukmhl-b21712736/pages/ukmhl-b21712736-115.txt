57 A DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTERIES. Medius, the nerves issuing from the Cervical Ver- tebrae, unite to form the Axillary Plexus, which it afterwards accompanies to the Axilla (w). The regular branches from this portion of the Brachial Artery that rise separately, or that rise in trunks common to two, are the Arteria Ster- nalis (v), or Mammaria Interna ; the Sacrothy'- roidea, or Thyroidea Inferior ; the Intercostalis Prima (n>), or Intercostalis Superior ; and the Ver- (u) Some have asserted, that after giving off the Cephalic Artery, it is still larger upon the right than the left side j but this assertion has not been confirmed by the observations and experiments of Haller. Where a difference exists, the Artery will naturally be largest on the side where the arm is largest, and is most employed in invigorating exercise. An anonymous writer, mentioned by Haller, maintains that, contrary to the common opinion, the vessels on the right side are the smallest, and that in conveying their proportion of blood, they, therefore, convey it with a greater velocity, which induces animals to use the right Atlantal extremity, in preference to the left. It is not improbable, that this writer, like many others, was more in the habit of seeing what he believed, than of believing what he saw. (v) The term Sternalis is borrowed from Portal, and is pre- ferable to the vague term Mammaria. (a>) Enumerating the Intercostal Arteries in the same order that we do the Nerves, Intercostalis Prima is more definite than Intercostalis Superior.

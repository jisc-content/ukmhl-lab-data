The Digital Muscles, also, can perform only adduc- tion and abduction. Of the Adductors or Extensors, there is the Adductor Phalangis Primoe, which corre- sponds with the Flexor Sublimis, arises from the Inter- nal Condyle, and is fixed to the base of the first Bone of the Great Finger. The Adductor Internus Phalan- gis Secundae, which corresponds with the Flexor Pro- fundus, and goes along the inner side of the Radius, to be inserted into the base of the second Phalanx. The Adductor Polljcis, which corresponds to the Flexor Pollicis, is situated between the preceding Muscle and Ulna, and sends a Tendon to be fixed to the radial edge of the Thumb. The Adductor Externus Pha- langis Secundas, which is analogous to the Flexor Pro- prius Indicis, arises from the External Condyle, and has its Tendon fixed to the back of the Metacarpus and second Phalanx of the Great Finger. Muscles of the Pelvis and Inferior Extremity.^â€”The Psoas Parvus and Magnus, the Uiacus Internus, and Quadratus Lumborum, are wanting. There are two Adductor Muscles of the Thigh, situated as in Mamma- lia, and a Muscle analo^^ous to the Pectineus, which is continued to join the Flexor Perforatus of the second and fifth Toes. The three Glutei have the same pro-

In most Quadru- peds it is placed obliquely at the extremity of the Cra- nium, with its posterior edge turned upward. Ani- mals going upon all fours have the Occipital Foramen situated farther back, in proportion as the Face is elongated; to compensate for which, the Head is sus- pended by strong Muscles, and also by the Liga- mentum Nuchas placed upon the upper part of the Neck. The Ape tribe, but more particularly an Ourang- outang, which forms a medium between Man, who walks erect, and Quadrupeds, that move in a horizontal posture, have this passage nearer the centre of the base of the Cranium than it is in any other Animal, in con- sequence of which, they can support an erect posture longer than other Quadrupeds. The number of Bones here is in general the same as in Man; but Ossa Triquetra are seldom seen. All the Ape tribe have eight distinct pieces. In the Feroe and many others, the Parietal Bones are united at an early period ; but in many Quadrupeds, particularly Horned Cattle, the Os Frontis is divided by the Sagittal Suture for a considerable time. In some, as the Feroe and Horse, there is only one Parietal Bone ; while in others they are joined by accretion to the Os Occrpitis. The Bones of the Cranium, in an Elephant, are soon united into one piece, so as to appear like a single Bone. - In the Cetacea, the Parietal, Occipital, and Temporal Bones, are early united. In a great variety of Ani- mals of this class, the portion of the Os Temporis, con- taining the internal parts of the Ear, is separated from

OF THE LIVER, &c. [Part II. The Rectum, previously to its ending in the Anus, forms a dilatation termed Cloaca, which is suspended under the Os Coccygis, and receives the terminations of the Ureters, the ends of the Vasa Deferentia, and Penis, where it exists ; the opening of the Oviduct in a Female, and the orifices from the Bag termed Bursa Fabricii. The Cloaca varies in form in different Species, but has more or less of an oval appearance. It serves as a reservoir of Urine and Fseces in both sexes. It is moved by various Muscles which arise from the Bones in the neighbourhood. The Bursa Fabrtcii is situated at the upper and back part of the Cloaca, into which it opens in both sexes. In some of the large Birds, as a Goose, it is fully an inch in length, and is lined with Mucous Glands internally. It is largest in young Birds; in old ones, it is quite contracted. It is constantly found empty, and its use is unknown. The Omentum is wanting in Birds in general, unless a lump of Fat which covers the Intestines in some Aquatic Fowls, be considered as such. In an Ostrichj there is an Omentum with a large quantity of Fat.

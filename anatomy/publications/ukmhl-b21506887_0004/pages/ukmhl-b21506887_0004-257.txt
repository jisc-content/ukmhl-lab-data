Paht II.] OF BIRDS. 253 those of Mammalia, which also assist in fixing them in their place. The largest of the Yolks are always found at the outer side. Each is inclosed in a Calyx^ or Membrane supported on a Pedicle, or Foot-stalk, which is fixed to the Ovarium. When the Yolk is ripe, it bursts the Membrane, and is then received by the Infundibulum, which con- veys it to the Oviduct. The Infundibulum has a plaited or folded margin, like the Fimbriae of the Fallopian Tube, and is connected behind by a round Ligament. The Oviduct is at first straight, but after- wards so convoluted as frequently to exceed the length of the Bird, and gradually increases in thickness and strength, till it reaches the Cloaca. Externally, it is covered by the Peritoneum, within which are some Muscular Fibres. The inner side is formed by a Membrane covered with Follicles, which secrete the white of the Egg. It has a number of broad lon- gitudinal folds, and is connected to the Spine by a kind of Mesentery. The Oviduct terminates, and deposites the Egg, in the Uterus, which is full of wrinkles internally, and may be considered as merely a dilated part of the Ovi- duct. In the Uterus, the Egg receives first its form, and then its shell. The Vagina, in a common Fowl, is about an inch and a half in length. From this the Egg is discharged into the Cloaca, by the Muscular power of the Uterus, and action of the surrounding parts. The termination of the Vagina is at the left side of the Cloaca, which receives also the end of the Rectum and the two Ure- ters.

In Cetacea, on the con- trary, it is almost entirely fixed down to the Jaw; but in Quadrupeds in general, it is nearly as loose as in a Human Body. In some Animals, it serves as an Or- gan of taste; in others, it is also employed for taking in the Food. In most Quadrupeds, it is proportionally longer and narrower than in Man, and possesses the same kind of Papillag, the chief difference being in their form. In the generality of Herbivora, especially Pecora^ the Tongue is covered with a firm Cuticle, forming in- numerable sharp-pointed Papillae, directed towards the Throat. These, like so many tenter-hooks, assist in laying hold of the grass, and other kinds of Food, and serve, at the same time, to increase the Organ of taste. In some of the Monkey tribe, the Papillae Maximae are fewer in number, and differently disposed from those in Man. In Feroe, the Tongue differs little from that in a Human Body. In the Cat kind, besides many round and conical Papillae, there is a horny or prickly set covering the Tongue, which render it rougher, and enable it to take a firmer hold of the prey. A Dog has upon the Mouth and root of the Tongue, many Papillae, placed obliquely backwards, which as- sist in preventing the Food from escaping.

147 Part I.] OF MAMMALIA. OF THE LUNGS, X HE Lungs agree in form, connexion, and structure, with those in Man, but the left bears a greater propor- tion to the right. Here, also, they are closely applied to the walls of the Thorax. In Amphibious Quadrupeds mdi Cetacea, they are of a firmer texture, and have more of an elongated and flattened appearance. For the most part there is a division into Lobes, and these are rather more deeply divided than in a Human Body. The greater number is in the Right Side. In many, as a Dog^ one of the Lobes goes behind the Heart, and between it and the Right Side of the Mediastinum ; in consequence of which a Bulla of air is frequently observed upon opening the cavity of the Thorax, which has been mistaken by some for air confined, during life, between the Lungs and their Parietes.

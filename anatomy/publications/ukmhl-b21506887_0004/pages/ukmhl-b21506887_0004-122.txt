[Part I. OF THE MOUTH, &c. 118 nivorous kind, have the Salivary Glands proportionally very small. In a SeaJ^ as already noticed, there are no Parotids nor Sublinguals; but there are two Sub- maxillaries, a great and a small, the common Duct of which opens in the ordinary place. In Solipeds, the Salivary Glands are of great size, and have a lobulated appearance. In a Horse, the Parotid is very large, and, extending above and be- hind the Concha, goes beyond the angle of the Jaw; the Duct runs by the under part of the Masseter, and opens upon a Papilla opposite to the Fourth Molaris of the Upper Jaw. The Submaxillary Gland extends along the side of the Larynx and Pharynx, having also a Papilla where the Duct opens at the side of the Frsenum Linguae. The Sublingual Gland opens by many small orifices arranged along the under part of the side of the Tongue. In Ruminants, also, the Salivary Glands are of great size. In an Ox and Sheep, the Parotid Duct passes by the inferior part of the Masseter, and perfo- rates the Cheek opposite to the second and third Supe- rior Molares. The Submaxillary is remarkably long here, and ex- tends, as in a Horse, along the Larynx and Pharynx, having a Papillary Valve at its termination. The Sub- lingual is very long in these Animals, has a single Duct which runs by the side of the Submaxillary, and opens upon a Papilla near the termination of the latter. In a Hog among Belluce, there are two Sublinguals on each side, one anterior to the other; the posterior,

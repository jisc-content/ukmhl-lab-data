Part II.] OF REPTILES. 263 order. The Bones of the Extremities have nothing very remarkable. In a Salamander, the Sternum, Clavicle, and Sca- pula, are in one piece, which receives the Head of the Os Humeri. In this class, the Fibula, as well as the Tibia, is in general articulated directly with the Os Femoris; and in all, the Astragalus is joined to the Tibia, and the Os Calcis to the Fibula. Of Serpents, one set move the Under Jaw only, ano- ther set, viz. Vipers and Venomous Serpents, move both Jaws. The Lower Jaw is articulated by a Glenoid Cavity, which corresponds with a Condyle of the Tem- poral Bone at the bottom of the Cranium. Serpents, whether innoxious ovpoisonous, are divided according to the nature of their Teeth. The former have both Jaws beset with small Teeth in two rows, with an interval between them. In the Poisonous Species, the outer row in the Upper Jaw is wanting, but their place is supplied by long hollow Tusks, which are con- nected with the Bag containing the poison, and serving as Excretory Ducts to convey it from the Glands at their roots, into the wound the Animal inflicts. The Tusks lie concealed in the Jaw, but can be darted out at the will of the Animal. In all poisonous â™¦S'^r- pents, the Upper Jaw is moveable on the Cranium. This allows them to open the mouth widely, by which they are enabled occasionally to swallow an Animal entire, the diameter of which sometimes surpasses that of their own Body. Serpents are remarkable for the number of their Ver~ tebrcB, which form almost the whole Skeleton. They vary in number from about 30 to upwards of 250, and

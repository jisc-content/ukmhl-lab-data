Part IV.] OF FISHES. 321 Cartilaginous Fishes, the outer set greatly exceed the inner in size. The length of the Osseous Canals varies in different Fishes; part of them forms a sort of Pulley, over which the Membranous Canals pass. The Membranous Canals vary also in length, but have in general the same kind of communication with the Vestibule, and with each other, and form the same kind of Ampullae, as in Fishes of the Cartilaginous kind. Nerves corresponding with those in a Shate^ are also dispersed upon the Sac and Ampullae ; but pass to the Labyrinth without perforating the Bones. OF THE NOSE. T HE Organ of Smelling is extensive in Fishes, though it has no connexion with the Organs of Respiration ; and is supposed to be acute, being a principal means by which they are enabled to search for their Food. The Nostrils, in Osseous Fishes, are generally di- vided by a cross Membrane, which gives the appear- ance of being double on each side. Some Muscular Fibres are found about the Nostrils, which admit of a small degree of dilatation or contraction occasionally, but the motion is not very evident. VOL. IV. X

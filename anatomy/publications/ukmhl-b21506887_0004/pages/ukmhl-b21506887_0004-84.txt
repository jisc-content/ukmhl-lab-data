80 OF THE INTEGUMENTS. [Pakt I. bare ; and no distinction can now be observed, but an irregular projection of a circular form at its base. When it drops from the Head, the Integuments close over the Bone with which it was connected, till the period of its renewal returns, when a Process pro- jects, and forms the succeeding Antler, which is always found to be longer than the preceding one. It is also observed, that the Branches of the Carotid Artery, which supply this substance, are dilated during its growth, but return to their former dimensions when it has acquired its full size. The Nails and Claws cover the last Phalanx of the Toes of Quadrupeds, and are of the same nature, and formed after the same manner, as Horns. They grow from the base to which the Integuments are fixed, and commonly cover the upper part of the Toes; but in some, as a Squirrel, Rat, &c. they entirely surround them. They belong to Quadrupeds in general, and are originally formed before the birth of the Animal. Their colour, as in the Horns, depends upon that of the Corpus Mucosum. They serve for rubbing, scraping, and for catching their prey, and, in general, for protecting the extremities of the Toes. They have no sensibility but at their roots. They are wanting in those Animals which do not use the Toes for walking, or for laying hold of the food. In such Animals as frequently dive or swim, the Toes are inclosed in Membranes. In Cetacea, they are concealed under the Skin, and form the Fins. All Ruminants, and many of the BellucE, have two Toes in'closed in triangular Hooves, forming a mould on which they walk. Solipeds have but one Toe,

OF THE EYE {PartIL tached the Cornea, which makes a section of a smaller globe. In consequence of the flatness of the anterior part of the Eye, it is prevented from being injured when the Animal is scrambling among bushes, or tak- ing a rapid flight through the air. The fore part of the Sclerotis divides into two Lami- nae, between which there are numerous Osseous Plates, which overlap each other, and form a Ring, commonly flat, but sometimes convex ; at other times, as in an Owl^ concave. The Choroid Coat has no Tapetum^ such as is found in many Quadrupeds. The inner side is uniformly blackish, and lined with Mucus, which prevents Birds from seeing distinctly in the dark. All Birds have Ciliary Processes, but they project so little, that they appear rather like Striae than loose Folds, and are connected to the Crystalline Lens. The boundary between the Choroides and Iris is dis- tinctly defined in this class. The Iris varies in appearance according to the Spe- cies. It is blue, red, or yellow, and commonly pos- sesses great brilliancy. In some, as a Parrot, the motions of the Iris are voluntary. The Animal can dilate or contract the Pu- pil at pleasure. A Memhrana Pupillaris is not observed in Foetal Birds. The Optic Nerves r\xw herein such a manner, that it is difiicult to distinguish any union in them. Upon reaching the Ball, each goes through a Sheath of the Sclerotic Coat, and then forms a round white line, which produces the Retina. In the internal part of the Eye, there is a Membrane

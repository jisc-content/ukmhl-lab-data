Part I.] OF MAMMALIA. 89 Bone. They are remarkable for their size in Herbivo- rous Animals. Each contains a Cavity, which commu- nicates with the anterior part of the Lateral Ventricle of that side by a small passage ; of course, there are six Ventricles in proper Quadrupeds. This circumstance gave rise to the ancient opinion, of the first pair of Nerves conducting the Pituita from the Brain to the Nose. The number of the Nerves from the Brain is the same as in Man. They vary chiefly according to the form and extent of the parts on which they are dis- persed. From the First Pair, numerous Fibrillae come off, to be distributed upon the different parts in the upper por- tion of the Nose. In a Sheep, there is also a Branch, arising, within the Cranium, from the upper part of each of the Trunks of the Nerve. In a Dolphin, Por- jpoise, and several other Cetacea, the Olfactory Nerves are entirely wanting, the First Branches of the Fifth Pair of Nerves being supposed to perform their ofiice. The Optic Nerves are conjoined as in Man, but they appear to be still more intimately incorporated. In large Animals, the Fibrillae composing these Nerves are so separated from each other by the Pia Mater, that after the Medullary Substance is dissolved by maceration, the remaining parts, by being inflated, ap- pear like so many distinct Canals. - The Third Pair goes through a hole on each side appropriated to it, when there is no Sphenoid Fissure, either singly, or in ^company with some of the other Nerves of the Eye, and is distributed as in Man.

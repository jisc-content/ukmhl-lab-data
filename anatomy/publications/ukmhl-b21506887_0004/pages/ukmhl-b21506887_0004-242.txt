238 ORGANS OF VOICE, &c. [Part 11. Most of the Cells are subdivided, especially in large Birds, by incomplete transparent partitions, which al- low the air to pass from one part of the Cells to ano- ther, and prevent them from being over-distended. In Adult Birds, the Air-Cells not only communicate with each other by considerable apertures, but also with the Cavities in the middle of the large Bones, of what- ever form. In many, they extend to the Axillae, and under the Pectoral Muscles, and even along the Shoulders under the Skin of the Wings and lateral parts of the Neck. This is found particularly to be the case in high-flying Birds, in which, also, they are remarkably large. They are extremely thin, but so dense, as to prevent , the air from escaping, except by the apertures which conduct it through the Body. In large Birds, the Cells are furnished with Fasci- culi of Muscular Fibres, considered as a Substitute for the Diaphragm. These serve to expel the air re- ceived in inspiration, and send it back by the Lungs and Trachea, in which they are assisted by the Mus- cles on the Thorax, Abdomen, &c. The distension of these Cells serves to render the A- nimal lighter in flying, so as to buoy it up in the air, and diminish the necessity of inspiring frequently in a long or rapid flight; and also in singing or swimming; and in large Birds, as an Ostrich and Cassowary, in running. They answer, besides, as a kind of secondary Lungs to the Blood, and are useful in the expulsion of the Faeces, Urine, and contents of the Genital Organs. They are also concerned in respiration, the Lungs

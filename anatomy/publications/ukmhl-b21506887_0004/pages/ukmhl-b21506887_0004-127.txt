Paet I.] OF MAMMALIA. 123 with Enamel only on their anterior surface, but this is continued along the roots ; hence, as the Osseous parts wear down sooner than the Enamel, the Animal is still capable of gnawing hard substances. The Teeth of GUres, the Tusks of an Elephant and Hippopotamus, and others of a similar nature, are in a constant state of growth, in consequence of a Pulpy Vascular Substance within them, upon which the Os- seoi^s part is" formed ; so that the interior part of the Tooth advances to supply the portion worn down. The Teeth of the Lower J aw of some of the Ani- mals of this order, as a Squirrel^ Bat, and Beaver^ are remarkable for the length of their roots, which nearly equals that of the Jaw itself, though a small portion only appears beyond the Gums. They are curved back under the roots of the Grinders, and sometimes go as far as the Coronoid Processes. The Tusk of a Narwal, or Sea Unicorn^ occupies the place of an Incisor, and is almost constantly (though not always) found single, the other one being either early destroyed, or lurking in the Jaw, as has been ob- served by a longitudinal section of the Alveolus. In the Leverian Museum, a Head of this Animal is preserved with two Tusks. The Canine Teeth of the Upper Jaw, in Mammalia, are placed close to the Intermaxillary Bones, and differ more in the different Genera than either the Incisores or Molares. In many of the Ape kind, and more espe- cially in the larger Carnivorous Animals, as a Lion or Tiger^ the Canine Teeth are of great size; and in some of the Swine tribe, as a Babiroussa, they ap-

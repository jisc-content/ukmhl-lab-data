Part I.J OF MAMMALIA. 101 in every direction, or turn it upon its own axis without moving the Head. All Adult Quadrupeds have the Meatus Externus osseous at its inner part; but it varies in length, width, and direction, in different Species. In some, it is cy- lindrical ; in others, flattened; in Apes, it is nearly as in Man : in Carnivora and Ruminants, it passes di- rectly inwards; in some, as an Otter and Pole-cat, it goes in a retrograde direction ; in Rodentia, it is di- rected downwards; in a Mole, where it is quite flat, it has the Membrana Tympani laid over it like a roof; in an Elephant and Horse, it goes downwards and back- wards. In some Animals which dive in water, it is pro- vided with a Valve, as in the case of a Water Shrew, - and some Whales. In Cetacea, the Osseous Canal, like the External Auricle, is wanting; in place of which there is a Cartilaginous Tube, which begins by an orifice proportionally very minute, on the surface of the Skin, and leads in a winding direction through the Fat, till it terminates at the Membrana Tympani. In an Ornithorrynchus, also, the Meatus is observed to be long and tortuous. The Membrana Tympani, the Tympanum, and the Eustachian Tube, are found to be common to all Mam- malia, and the Membrane of the Tympanum appears to be concave externally in all the individuals of the class, Cetacea not excepted. Its structure nearly re- sembles that in a Human Body. It is fixed in a case of Bone, which is commonly open above, and is some- what of an oval form, with the long diameter placed in

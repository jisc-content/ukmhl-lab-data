Part I.] OF MAMMALIA. 9S form, is pjaced at the inner corner of the Eye, and va- ries'in size as circumstances may require. In many, it is only a partial covering. In the Lion and Ca^ tribe. Elephant, Seal, &c.. it goes over the whole anterior part of the Eye. In Man and Apes, there is only a Rudi- ment of it. In Cetacea, it is wanting. The Caruncula Lacrymalis is observed in some, as the hooved Animals ; but in others it appears to be wanting. The Lacrymal Gland exists in almost all the Animals of the class, and has nearly the same situation as in Man. In some, as Ruminants, it is divided into Lobes. In a Hare and Rabbit, it is so large as to cover a great part of the Eye. The Ducts of this Gland are nume- rous, and, in larger Quadrupeds, can be readily seen passing through the Upper Eye-lid. Besides the Lacrymal Gland, several Quadrupeds have an additional substance, termed Glandula Har- deri. It exists in some of the Glires, in Carnivora, Ruminants, and Belluoe. In Ruminants, it is situated at the inner angle, and discharges a whitish humour, which passes by an orifice under the Palpebra Tertia. The Puncta Lacryraalia are in general the same as in Man. In a Hare, Rabbit, and some others, in place of Puncta, there is a slit under the Palpebra Tertia, opening into the Lacymal Duct. In Sheep, the Puncta join into a long Nasal Duct, which terminates near the bottom of the Nose. Some of the Ruminants, as a Deer and Antelope, are remarkable for the Larmiers, or FossÂ« Lacrymales, which are small cavities upon the Cheek under the Eye-

Part I.] OF MAMMALIA. 51 as in Man, the longest; in most other Quadrupeds, it is the shortest. The Coracoid Process is commonly wanting, though present in many. In a Pig^ the Spine of the Bone is almost effaced near the Humeral Extremity; but about its middle, there is a large projecting Process. Arm.—In all Animals, the Os Humeri is single in each Anterior Extremity, as in a Human Arm, and becomes shorter as the Metacarpus is elongated. In Animals with a single Metacarpal Bone, the Os Humeri is deeply seated in the Fleshy parts of the Thorax. There is often a hole in a kind of Linea Aspera which projects in the Arm-Bone, and frequent- ly a perforation in the Bone, where it receives the Ole- cranon. In a Mole^ the Os Humeri is peculiar, not only for its shortness, but in being articulated by one small head to the Scapula, and by another to the Clavicle. It is altogether of such a nature as to turn the Palm outwards, for working with the Hand. Fore-arm.—The motions of Supination and Prona- tion are found in the Anterior Extremity of a few Ge- nera only, and these are chiefly for enabling Animals to lay hold of, or search for, their food. In ApeSy the Bones of the Fore-arm have the same ge- neral appearance as in Man, but the Radius is the prin- cipal Bone. A Bat has no Ulna, or only the Rudi- ment of one. In Carnivora, the Olecranon is extended farther back than in Man. In a Pig, Elephant, and some other Animals of similarshape, the Radius is plac- ed entirely before the Ulna ; they move on a single pulley. In Solipeds and Pecora, the Ulna is only an Appen- B %

OF THE STOMACH. 150 [Part I. which the Food has a readier passage into the Intes- tines. In Ruminants, these two openings are closer together, leaving a Cul-de-Sac on each side; from which circumstance the food is longer detained. In the Ape tribe, particularly an Ourang-outang, the Stomach varies little in its general appearance from that in Man.

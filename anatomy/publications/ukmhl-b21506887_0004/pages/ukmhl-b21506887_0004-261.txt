Part II.] OF BIRDS. ^57 are expanded. The lining of the Shell is now covered with Blood-vessels, expanded upon a Membrane which forms the Chorion. Near the end of Incubation, the Umbilical Vessels begin to shrivel, and at the exclusion of the Chick, are quite diminutive. Production of the ChicJc,â€”At the end of the first day, a small white spot, the Nidus Pulli, seu CoUiquamentum, is discerned near the Cicatricula. On the second day, the Chick is observed in the form of a Gelatinous Filament, and the Cicatricula soon afterwards vanishes. At the end of the second day. Blood-vessels appear upon the sur- face of the Yolk, and these soon become connected to the Chick. The Vascular part is termed Figura Ve- nosa^ or Area Vasculosa. The Arteries arise from the Mesenteric; the principal Vein goes to the Porta. Be_ sides the Blood-vessels, a Canal is formed in the course of Incubation, which joins the Membrane of the Yolk to the Intestinum Ilium of the Chick, under the name Ductus VitellO'intestinalis. Third day, the Punctum Saliens, or Heart, appears, and is distinguished by its motion. The Spine is seen in a curved state, with pro- minences, which are the Brain and Eyes, the latter of which are remarkable for their great proportional size. Fourth day, the Abdominal Viscera appear, after which the Extremities sprout out. A Vascular Membrane, the Chorion, or Membrana Umbilicalis, begins to form about the Navel, which, increasing by degrees, lines almost the whole inner surface of the Membrana Albu- minis during the latter half of the'period of Incuba- tion. The Chorion consists of innumerable Arteries and Veins ; the latter are distinguished from the former by being filled with pure red Blood, while the Arte- VOL. IV. R

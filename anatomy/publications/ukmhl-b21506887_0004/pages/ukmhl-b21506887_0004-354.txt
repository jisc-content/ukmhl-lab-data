350 OF MOLLUSCA. [Part V. Tongue. In Acephalay a proper Tongue is not very evident. The Salivary Glands, in Cephalopoda and Gasteropoda^ are considerable. In the former there are two pairs, each having a Duct, which unites with its fellow, and opens into the Mouth near the Tongue ; the latter have commonly but one pair, which lies near *the Mouth. Circulating System.â€”In Cephalopoda, the Circulat- ing Organs are more complicated than in other Ani- mals. In a Cuttle-Fish, there are three Hearts, two Pulmonary, and one Aortic. Each of the Pulmonary Hearts consists of an Auricle and Ventricle. The Aor- tic Heart has only a Ventricle. There are two Pul- monary Arteries, one in each Gill, and the same num- ber of corresponding Veins ; an anterior and a posterior Aorta ; and an anterior and two posterior Venae Cavae. At the opening of the Veins into the Hearts, of the Auricles into the Ventricles, and of these into the Ar- teries, Valves are placed to prevent the retrograde di- rection of the Blood. The Ventricles have also Co- lumnae Carneae, as in the former classes of Animals. The anterior Cava separates behind into two parts, each of which receives a posterior Cava, and terminates in an Auricle. Where the Veins meet at the Pulmona- ry Hearts, there is an intricate net-work of Columnag Carneae and Foveae. The Auricle opens into the Ven- tricle, which is placed at the root of a corresponding Gill. From the Ventricle the Branchial Artery is sent out, which runs along one side of the Gill, while the Vein returns by the other. The Branchial Vein termi- nates in the Aortic Ventricle, from the opposite ends of which the Aortae go out, that send Branches to the dif-

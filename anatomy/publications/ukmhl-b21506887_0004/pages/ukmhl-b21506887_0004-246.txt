OF THE ALIMENTARY CANAL [Part IL is more general among Birds than the Crop, and va- ries much in size in the different Species. It has a covering from the Peritoneum, and is generally thicker than the Esophagus, owing to its numerous Glands, from which a fluid is discharged. In an Ostrich, this Stomach, from its size and form, has the appearance of a Crop. The Mucous Glands here are about the size of Garden-Peas, and have ori- fices uncommonly distinct. It dilates into a Bag ca- pable of containing several pints of water, and is much larger than the proper Stomach into which it opens. The Infundibulum, in Birds, ends in the Ventriculus Callosus, Gizzard, or Third Stomach, which, in Galli- naceous Birds, is much larger than the Infundibulum ; but in others it is the reverse. In a Pie, the Third Stomach is only about half the size of the Second, and in an Ostrich, several times less. It is generally situa- ted in the upper part of the Abdomen, close to the Spine, and resting upon the Intestines; though, in some few Birds, it is covered by these. It is commonly of a globular figure, and a little com- pressed, and is composed of four Muscles, remarkable for their great thickness and strength. Two of these are situated laterally, and have Fibres running in a radiated manner about two Tendons placed at the sides of this Organ. The other two Muscles are much smaller than the former, and are situated at the extre- mities of the Stomach. The Gizzard is covered externally by a Tendinous Expansion, and lined within by a thick, strong, cal- lous Coat, considered by some as a continuation of the

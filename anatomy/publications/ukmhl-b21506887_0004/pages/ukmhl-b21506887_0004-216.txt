2U OF THE MUSCLES [Part II. portions as in Quadrupeds. The Pyriformis and Ge- mini are wanting. The Muscle analogous to the Qua- dratus Femoris is remarkable for its great size. The Obturator Internus goes over the Hole analogous to the Foramen Thyroideum. The Extensors of the Leg are nearly as in Quadrupeds. Of the Flexors, there are two somewhat analogous to the Biceps and Semi-mem- branosus; a third, which is intermediate, but is some- times wanting, particularly in Birds of prey ; and a fourth, which forms the anterior part of the Thigh, and is similar to the Sartorius. The Tendons of the Gas- trocnemii remain separate to near the Heel. The So- leus is fixed to a Linea Aspera, which belongs to the . Tibia. There is a Peroneus Brevis, and a Muscle ana- logous to the Peroneus Tertius in Man. There is an Extensor Longus of the three Anterior Toes, corresponding to the Extensor Longus Digitorum. The Extensor Longus Pollicis is wanting; four small Muscles supply the place of the Extensor Brevis; a Flexor Brevis Pollicis is situated in the back part of the Tarsus. There are long Flexors of the Toes, which are divided into three masses ; these come partly from the Os Femoris, and partly from the Bones of the Leg. They have connected to them an Accessory Flexor, which comes from the Pubes, and sends a Tendon over the Knee. The different Tendons run under the Heel, and are united by Fibres to each other ; and one set of Tendons perforate another, and are fixed to the diffe- rent Phalanges of the Toes. By this mechanism, the Bird is supported, or can lay hold of Branches of Trees, &c. when roosting; the weight of the Body giving that degree of flexion to the Knee and Heel, which produces the necessary contraction of the Toes. By this contri-

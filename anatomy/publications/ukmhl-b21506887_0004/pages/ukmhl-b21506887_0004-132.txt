" OF THE MOUTH, &c. [Part I. 128 Jaw ; the four following in the 42d, and the four ex- ternal, or Corner Teeth, in the 54th. The Permanent Corner Teeth do not grow so soon as the other Inci- sors ; and when they appear, they scarcely project be- yond the Jaw. The hollow in the middle of the Incisors, filled with blackish Tartar, is worn off by use between six years and a half and eight years, after which it is entirely ef- faced. In the Corner Teeth it remains longer, in consequence of which the Animal's age can generally be known with considerable accuracy. After this pe- riod the age is only judged of by the length of the In- cisors, which are in a constant state of growth. Of Molares, the two first in each Jaw appear at the end of the first week after birth, the following at the end of the third, and the small Anterior Molaris be- tween the fifth and sixth week. The first back Molaris appears near the end of the first year, the second near that of the second year. Be- tween the second and third year, the first Milk Molares fall, the third drops in three years ; and it is not till five or six years that the last Molaris appears. The Temporary Molares are distinguished by being longer from before backwards than the permanent set. The Teeth of an Ass are observed to fall out and grow at the same age, and in the same manner as those of a Horse; and he has nearly the same marks in his mouth. In Ruminants, there are three Milk Molares, which are replaced by three others, and three Permanent Mo- lares. The Milk Molares are distinguished from the permanent set, by being longer from before backward

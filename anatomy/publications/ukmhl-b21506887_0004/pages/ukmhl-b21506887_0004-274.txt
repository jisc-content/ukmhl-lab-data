^70 OF THE BRAIN [Part III. of Animal, lurking in the earth, acquires the colour of the substance which surrounds it. Reptiles have likewise their Papilloe Nervosce^ but these are found chiefly in the Feet. The Glands of the Skin are more visible in this than in some of the preceding classes. In a Lizard, there is a range of Follicles under each Buttock, which dis- charge a viscid humour. In a Toad, Glands are ir- regularly dispersed over the Skin ; and in a Salaman- der, along the Back, which throw out an acrid matter, especially when the Animals are irritated; yet these Reptiles are often handled with impunity. The Panniculus Carnosus exists in the Neck of a Turtle, and some appearance of it is observed in the Neck of a Frog; but in the Body of the Animal, it is wanting. The Claws on the Digits of the individuals of this class, are wanting wherever the Animal does not use these parts for seizing its prey, or for walking, as in a Tortoise, Frog, &c. OF THE BRAIN, The Brain of Reptiles, consisting, as in the former classes of Animals, of Cerebrum and fcerebellum, is extremely small in proportion to the size of the Cra nium. In some, it is several thousand times less than the Body, and without being divided into Circumvo- lutions.

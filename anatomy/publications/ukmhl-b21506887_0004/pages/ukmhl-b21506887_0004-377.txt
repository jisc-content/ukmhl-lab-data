373 Part VII.] OF INSECTS. being in some simple, in others complicated, and diffe-^ rently contorted and collected into Fasciculi. The Female Organs are mbre uniform than the Male. In the whole class they consist of Tubes or Ovaria, containing the Ova. The Tubes unite into two Canals and these into an Oviduct, which terminates in a com- mon opening, the Vulva. These parts are even seen in a Chrysalis a little before the Metamorphosis. All Insects are Oviparous; their Ova change first into Lar~ voe, Caterpillars^ or Maggots. The Maggot changes into ,a Chrysalis^ Pupa^ Nympha, or Aurelia. This forms an Imago, Fly, or perfect Insect. The parts of the future Animal are observed not only in a Caterpillar, but also in a Chrysalis, though more distinct in the former. Before Caterpillars change to the Chrysalis state, each spins to itself a covering. The Secretory Organ which forms this is found to be the same in Insects in general, and is well exemplified in a Silk-worm. It consists of two long tortuous Tubes, which enlarge by degrees, and form a Sac or Reservoir, from which a Duct goes out, and terminates below the Under Lip. In working the Silk, the Animal fixes its Mouth to some point of a solid substance, from which it carries out a Thread as yet glutinous; this, spun to some length, is fastened to another point, from which a second Thread is drawn out in a different direction ; and so on, till, by successiverepetitions, the Animal is completely inclosed. In a SiTkJworm, the change from Chrysalis to a Fly, happens in ten or more days, according to the season. The copulation of these Animals is exceed- ingly tedious, the Male beating his Vikings upwards of

Part I.] OF MAMMALIA. 103 has been frequently mistaken for the Lab3rrinth in these Animals. The internal Parts of the Ear, in the Whale tribe, are not connected to the Bones of the Cranium, as in other Mammalia, but are loosely attached by Liga-. ments. The Eustachian Tube, in Mammalia, has nearly the same kind of structure and opening as in Man. In a Horse, it communicates with a large Sac placed in the lateral and posterior part of the Mouth. In Cetacea, it is of great size, and terminates at the Nose or Blowing Hole, where there is a Valve to prevent the water from rushing into it when thrown out by this opening. The Ossicula Auditus are the same in number in aL most all Mammalia, but they vary much in form and size in the different Species. In some Quadrupeds, as a Mole, Marmot, and Guinea Pig, a Process is found, which extends from one side of the Fenestra Ovalis to the other, and passes between the Crura of the Stapes, so that, when the Stapes is removed, there appears to be two Fenestras Ovales. In a Whale, that Bone has very nearly an entire Plate, instead of two Crura. In some of the Pecora, one or two additional Bones are occasionally found. An Ornithorri/nchus, on the contrary, has only two Ossicula, the second of which approaches in its form to the single Bone in Birds, (see Phil. Trans. 1805.) The Muscles of the Internal Ear of Mammiferous Animals appear to be nearly the same as in man. The figure and size of the Fenestra Rotunda, and Fenestra Ovalis, are found to vary considerably. In

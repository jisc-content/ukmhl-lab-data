OF THE INTESTINES. [Paht I. 158 have no distinction into small and great Intestines; but in such Animals, an Appendix or Caecum forms the boundary between the parts corresponding with these. Where there is no Appendix or Caecum, a Valve, cor- responding to the Valvula Coli, points out the differ- ence ; and where even this is wanting, as in a Sloth, Armadillo, and Hedge-hog, the large Intestines are dis- tinguished by their want of Villi, by the thickness of their Coats, and particularly by the strength of their longitudinal Muscular Fibres. Carnivorous Quadrupeds, for the most part, have no proper Colon. Instead of it, many have a widened Intestine, but not tacked up by Ligaments into Cells. On the contrary, Animals that feed on vegetables have a true Colon or Caecum, or both ; and the Colon is in general remarkably large in proportion, and di- vided into Cells by Tendinous Cords running length- ways, to retard the motion of the Food ; but to the above rules there are many exceptions. Among Carnivora, some of the Bat tribe have a Cellular Colon. An Opossum^ a real Carnivorous A- nimal, has a long Caecum. The Intestinum Caecum is found in such Animals as have the Intestines distinguished into small and great. It appears merely as a prolongation of the great Intes- tine at the termination of the small; but it varies much in size, form, and structure, in different Animals, and not only in the sanie order, but in different Species of the same Genus. In many, particularly of the Carnu mra, it is wanting. In Carnivorous Animals, the Caecum is small and uniform on its external surface, but is destitute of Cells

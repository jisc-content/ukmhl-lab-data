218 [Part II. OF THE BRAIN, &c. Quadrigemina being either absent or indistinct, though the Pineal Gland is present. In each of the Optic Thalami, there is an additional Ventricle^ which opens into the passage leading from the Third to the Fourth Ventricle. The Cerebellum is only a simple Lobe ; it has, how-^ ever, transverse Striae, somewhat similar to those in Mammalia. The Fourth Ventricle has also, as in that class, a Calamus Scriptorius, and an Arbor Vitae; but the latter is more simple than inMammiferous Animals. The Pons Varolii is wanting. The Medulla Oblon- gata has no Eminences, such as are seen in the form^er class of Animals. Nerves. The Cerebral Nerves are the same in number as in Mammalia. The Olfactory, on each side, after leaving the Brain, goes in a distinct Canal to the Cavity of the Nose. The Second crosses its fellow, and goes to the Eye of the opposite side. The Third, either by a hole peculiar to it, or by a Sphenoid Fissure, passjes to the Muscles, as in Mammalia. The Fourth is also as in. the former class. The Fifth divides as in Mammalia. The Branches to the Beak correspond with those about the Jaws in Mammiferous Animals; but those to the inner side of the Nose are of great magnitude, and run to the extremity of the Bill, in Birds which search for their food in water, mud, &c. The Sixth is as in Mamma-, lia. Of the Seventh^ the Portio Dura is proportionally smiall, the Lips being absent, and much of their Bill being Horny and Callous, and not requiring a great supply of Nerves. The Portio Mollis^ of great size.

ORGANS OF VOICE, &c. [Part II. ward. Sometimes it is formed by the angle made by the two Bronchi. The Vocal Organ is furnished with Muscles from the surrounding parts, and these vary in number in different Species. The strength of the Muscles of the Inferior Larynx, was found, by Mr Hunter, to be in proportion to that of the Voice. They appeared stronger in a Common Cock, but weaker in a Capon; and here the Animal loses the power of crowing. The Muscles of the Larynx of a Niglitingale\ were found stronger than in any other Animal of the same size. At the Inferior Larynx the Voice of the Animal is chiefly formed, as may be observed by cutting the Trachea across below the Superior Larynx, in a living- Bird ; or in a recently killed one, after performing the same operation, and blowing in air till it distends the Air Cells, then suddenly forcing it out again, by com- pressing the Body ; or by cutting out the under end, with part of the Bronchi, and blowing air from the Pulmonary Extremity, The Inferior Glottis is compared to the reed at the mouth of the wind instruments, as a Clarionet, &c. the Superior Glottis to the holes, and the Trachea to the Body of the instrument. The Bronchi are formed of two Tubes, which, like the Trachea, are commonly cylindrical, but sometimes have dilatations and contractions, and are composed of Cartilaginous or Osseous Arches, the curves varying occasionally by the action of the Muscles. The Bronchi proceed in angles more or less acute, but are never subdivided, till they enter the Lungs, after which they lay aside their Cartilaginous structure,

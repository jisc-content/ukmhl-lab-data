Part I.] OF MAMMALIA. 165 L 2 The Colon forms two transverse convolutions, like Pouches, which cover most of the Intestines. It is tacked up externally by longitudinal Muscular Bands, and has large Cells also internally. The Valvula Coli is of a circular form. The Caecum is proportionally short, but very large, and, like the Colon, is formed into Cells. The inner side of the Canal has no Villi, but numerous short Papillae. In a Rhinoceros, the small Intestines are remarka- bly short, but the surface internally is increased in its extent by numerous Processes of an oblong form, co- vered with conspicuous Villi, and appearing to supply the place of Valvulae Conniventes in Man. The Cae- cum of this Animal is still larger than that of a Horse, and adds much to the bulk of the Abdomen. The Intestines, in a Hippopotamus, have nearly the same width for about two-thirds of their length, but afterwards become almost double the diameter through- out. In Cetacea, Whales are observed to have their In- testines proportionally longer than the other Carni- vora. There is no great difference in their size; they diminish gradually from the Pylorus to the Anus. They have no Caecum nor Cells, but are furnished with longitudinal Plicae of a zig-zag appearance, arid are covered with Villi. In a Porpoise, the Guts are long, and, as in the other Cetacea, are all nearly of the same size, diminishing a little from the Pylorus to the Anus. There is no Caecum, nor Valvulae Conniventes in any part of the Canal. The Peritoneum and Mesentery exist in all Vertebral

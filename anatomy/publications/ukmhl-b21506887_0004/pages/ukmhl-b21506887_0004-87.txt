Part I.] OF MAMMALIA. 83 A Badger, Opossum, and other Marsupial Animals, have Pouches on the Abdomen, lined with fine Hair, and discharging from their surface secretions of a Seba- ceous nature, which, when recent, have a disagreeable odour, but are found, after being dried, like the Scent Bags in many other Animals, to acquire an agreeable musky smell. Over the Sacrum of an Aper Moscifer, or Mexican Hog, there is a Gland termed Dorsal, some inches in length, and lobulated, from which a Duct opens on the Skin, and pours out a liquor which has also a musky smell. In the Feet of several Ruminants, especially in iS^^^^, are Glandular Cavities, lined with Hair, and sending out an Excretory Duct, which opens at the junction of the Hooves. F 2

Part II.] OF BIRDS. vance, also. Rapacious Birds seize their prey while pouncing on it. When they wish to disengage them- selves, .^they do it readily by raising the Body, after which the Toes are expanded. OF THE INTEGUMENTS, Thp: Integuments consist of the same parts as in Mam- malia. The Cuticle is very thin, and, in the Legs and Feet, is generally formed of Horny Scales, which fall off in moulting-time. The Corpus MuÂ£osUm is not very distinct. It varies in colour in different parts of the Body. In the Legs and Feet, almost all the different colours are to be ob- served in the different individuals of the class. The Cutis is much thinner than in Quadrupeds, but has considerable thickness in Birds of prey. The Pa- pillae Nervosae, and sense of feeling in the Integuments of Birds, reside only in the Feet and Toes, the Supe- rior Extremities being generally covered with Feathers. Even in the Lower extremities of some, the Legs and Toes are frequently covered with Scales or Feather's, so as to blunt the sense of Feeling also in this part of the Animal. The Cellular Substance immediately under the Skin, adheres loosely to the parts directly above and below it, but particularly at the Axillae. In certain Birds, as a Swallozv, the Subcutaneous C ellular Substance is deprived of Fat, though the Pe- ritoneum is charged with it in the winter-season.

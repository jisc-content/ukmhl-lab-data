Of the Insertion of the Biliary and Pancreatic Ducts there is great variety; but from many comparisons it appears, that the Pancreatic Duct opens first into the Intestine, that the Hepatic is inserted a little farther on, and that at a little distance farther is the termina- tion of the Ductus Cysticus. Kidneys. The Kidneys, which are proportionally large in this class, are placed in the Cavities of theOssa Innominata, at the sides of the Lumbar Vertebrae, with a few ex- ceptions. They form a double row of regular Lobes, connected together, though the first are generally se- parated from the rest, and are the largest. On each side, this first Lobe receives an Artery from the Aorta, the others derive them from the Femoral Artery. They return their Blood to the Femoral Vein and Vena Cava. Each Kidney sends out an Ureter, which terminates in the upper part of the common Cloaca, but not in the Penis. The Urinary Bladder is absent in the whole class. The Urine generally mixes with the Faeces, and, in a common Fowl, has a chalky appearance. In an Ostrich and Cassowary, the Cloaca serves as a Bladder, and they are the only Animals of the class which are observed to pass Urine. In an Ornithorrynchus, the Urine passes from the Bladder by a distinct Canal, which terminates in the Rectum, without going through the body of the Penis.

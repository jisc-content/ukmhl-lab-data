2M OF THE ALIMENTARY CANAL [Part IL this passage in some Fish-eaters, that whole Animals are contained in it till the Stomach can receive them. The structure of the Stomach of these Birds differs much from that of the plurality of Stomachs in the former kinds, being merely a Musculo-membranous Sac, The Food, too, is here more easily digested. But there are many intermediate links in the diversified structure of Stomachs in the Animals of this class. Most Piscivorous Birds want the Crop; when this is the case, the Infundibulum is larger, as if to supply its place. The Pylorus, in Birds, has no Sphincter. The Intes- tinal Canal is much shorter than in Mammalia. It varies from twice to five times the length of the Animal. In anOstrichf on the contrary, it is found to be between twenty and thirty times the length. The Canal is also shorter and narrower in Carnivorous Birds than in those living on vegetable Food, yet many Fish- eaters have it equally extensive. In all Birds, there is a distinction into small and great Intestines, though, to external appearance, the difference is very inconsiderable. The small Intestines are commonly longer than the great, as in Mammalia; but sometimes shorter, as in an Ostrich, where the great Intestines are longer than the small. The situation, form, and structure of the Intestines, are nearly the same in the greater number of Birds. The Duodenum begins near the termination of the Eso- phagus, but there is a prominence in some, as a com- mon Fowl, between the two openings, which may pre- vent the Food from escaping till properly digested.

OF THE LARYNX, &c. [Part I. 144 most part of which is covered by the Thyroid and Arytenoid Muscles. Behind the Base of the Epiglottis there is also a Foramen, leading to a cavity situated tinder the anterior edge of the Thyroid Cartilage, but having no communication with the Lateral Sacs. An Ass has the same kind of Falciform Membrane with a Horse, and the same number of Pouches or Sacs, but their Mouths are smaller; while the middle Pouch in an Ass is sensibly larger than in a Horse, and is the part from which the sound is considered to come in braying. In a Mule produced from a Male-Ass and a, Mare, or between a Stallion and a She-Ass, it appears that the Larynx is more like that of the Mother, though the voice rather resembles that of an Ass. The An- terior Sac in a Mule is larger than in an Ass. Ruminants have a simple Larynx. The Arytenoid Cartilages are curved back, and form more than half of the Glottis. Their inner surfaces touch each other. There are neither Anterior Ligaments nor Ventricles in some of the individuals of this order, as an Ox and Sheep. In some of the Deer kind, a passage is found at the Base of the Epiglottisj which leads to a Sac similar to that of the Ape tribe, and is in them situated between the Epiglottis and Thyroid Cartilage. A Pig has two Bags situated above or before the Ligaments of the Glottis, which occasion the grunting of the Animal. In an Elephant, the Epiglottis reaches behind the Posterior Nares, above the Velum Palati. Between the Thyroid and Arytenoid Cartilages there is a deep cavi- 4)

Fart l.J OF MAMMALIA. 87 viduals. In an Ape^ there are posterior Lobes, and these lie over the Cerebellum, as in a Human Body ; but in other true Quadrupeds, the Posterior Lobes, sti^ctly so called, are wanting ; the Cerebellum lying exposed behind the Cerebrum. In a Dolphin^ the Cerebellum is covered by the Cerebrum. The circumvolutions of the Brain are not so deep in other Mammalia as in Man, and they are generally less numerous. In an Ape, they are much fewer. In Rodentia^ as a Mouse, &c. there are, in general, no dis^ tinctly marked convolutions ; though they are nume- rous in Carnivora, Solipeds, and Ruminants. In all Mammalia, the Cerebellum is marked nearly as in Man, with Transverse Fissures, which, in Carni- vora, Solipeds, and Ruminants, divide it into Lobules, forming Convolutions somewhat as in the Cerebrum ; but these vary much in different Animals. The mid- dle Lobes of it are proportionally larger than in the corresponding parts of a Human Body. The Cortical and Medullary parts of the Brain are similar to those in Man. The Corpus Callosum, Cor- pora Striata, and Fornix, vary only a little in their breadth, the last frequently covering a considerable portion of the Optic Thalami. The Lateral Ventricles have no Digital Cavities, in consequence of the absence of the posterior Lobes. The Cornua Ammonis are, in general, larger in pro- portion, but they are not so prominent on the surface. In a Horse, Ox, Sheep, &c. the third Ventricle forms a sort of circular passage, which surrounds the Commissura Mollis of the Optic Thalami. The fourth Ventricle has nothing remarkable about it; the Arbor

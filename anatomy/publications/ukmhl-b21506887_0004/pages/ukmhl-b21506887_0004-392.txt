OF ZOOPHYTES. [Part IX. 388 for each Branch of the Body, and these are composed of the Ova, which have a reddish colour. In a Holothuria, there is a collection of slender Tubes, which greatly extend at particular seasons, and are considered as the Ova; but there is, besides, near the Anus, numerous white spiral Filaments, but whe- ther belonging t^i the Male Sex is uncertain. The Zoophytes properly so called, have no Generative Organs ; they propagate by Buds and Slips, something- after the manner of the growth in Branches of Trees. In Actinia and Polypi^ the young sprout out from any part of the external surface of the Parent. When they are divided, each of the portions forms a perfect Animal. Corals, Madripores, &c. are compound Polypi, fixed upon a Calcareous Base, constructed by the Animals themselves. Sponges are also compound Animals, having a Ve- getating Root and Stem. In their recent state, they consist of an Animal Jelly. They are furnished with ex- ternal pores, by which they imbibe the water, in which they exist, and with fecal orifices, through which they eject a fluid. Though thus imbibing and ejecting fluid, they do not seem to possess any contractile power, the strongest stimuli applied not causing any contrac- tion. After death, the Jelly of which they are com- posed disappears, nothing but the base of the Animal remaining. FINIS. Edinburgh : Printed by Johx Pill an Jameses Court.

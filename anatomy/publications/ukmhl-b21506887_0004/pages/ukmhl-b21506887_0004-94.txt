[Part I. 90 OF THE BRAIN. The Fourth, also, as in Man. The Fifth, as in the Human Species, is also divided into three Branches on each side, and these are larger or smaller, according to the form of the different parts of the Face. In Carnivorous Animals, as a Tiger^ the second and third portions of this Nerve appear to be uncommonly large. The Sixth Pair, as in a Human Body, are bathed in blood; and, while in the Cavernous Sinuses, are connected by one, two, or more Branches on each side, with the Great Sympathetic. The Seventh, as in Man, divides on each side into the Portio Dura and Portio Mollis. The former differs according to the form and extent of the different parts of the Face upon which it is dispersed. The Portio Mollis, as in Man, is entirely spent in the Labyrinth of the Ear. The Eighth and Ninth are dispersed nearly as in Man. The Great Sympathetic Nerve has nearly the same connexion in the Cranium with the Fifth and Sixth Pairs,—-the same connexion in its course with the Nerves near it,—^^and forms the same kind of Ganglia, as in Man ; only varying a little in the number of Fi- laments sent off, or in the form of the Ganglia. Spinal Marrow and Vertebral Nerves. The Spinal Marrow is covered by the same Mem- branes, and divided into two Lateral Cords in the same manner as in a Human Body. The division into two Lateral Portions is still more distinctly marked than

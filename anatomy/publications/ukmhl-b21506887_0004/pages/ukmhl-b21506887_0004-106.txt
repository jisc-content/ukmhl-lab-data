102 OF THE EAR. [Part I. a vertical, or in an oblique direction, though it varies in this last respect considerably in different Animals. The Tympanum differs in size, form, and situation. It is oval in some, round or hemispherical in others, and in several it is angulated ; or is sometimes so shal- low as to be in form of a chink. In the Ape tribe, there are scarcely any Mastoid Cells to communicate with the Tympanum, the Pro- cess containing these in a Human Body, being in this race of Animals almost obliterated; but, in place of Mastoid Cells, there are others which extend a consi- derable way into the Temporal Bone. In the greater part of digitated Mammalia, instead of a Mastoid Process, there is a Bony Organ, commu- nicating with the proper Tympanum, which, in the greater part of GUres and Carnivora, forms a large Cavity, or Bulla Ossea, that makes the principal part of the Tympanum. This, in a Dog^ Cat, Limi, Ti" ger, &c, is globose ; in Ruminants, it is angular ; in a Bear, it is wanting. In Solipeds, Ruminants, Pigs, &c. the Cavity is divided into Cells, and there is behind this a long Process, like the Mastoid, or in some like the Styloid, but belonging to the Occipital Bone. In some Animals, as an Indian Hog, Marmot, and Porcupine, the walls of the Tympanum shew vestiges of Cells ; but the Cellular appearance is more distinct in an Elephant, where this Cavity is of great size. The Tympanum, with its Bulla Ossea, in Ceta- cea, is formed of a Bony Lamina, rolled on itself like a Concha; but there is no spiral Cavity in it, the sub- stance being quite solid and hard like a rock.

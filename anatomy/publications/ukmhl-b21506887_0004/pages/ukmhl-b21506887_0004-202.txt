In Marsupial Animals, as a Kanguroo and Opos-^ sum, there is a Bag or Pouch, formed by, the Com- mon Integuments, and lined thinly with Hair. It is connected with a pair of Bones arising from the Pubes, which have Muscles for raising them and the Pouch along with them. It is closed by a Sphincter Muscle, * and opened by its own relaxation, or by a Muscle which draws the Pouch towards the Vulva, to receive the young at the time of delivery. Whether an Embryo ever possesses an Umbilical Cord, or a connexion with the Uterus similar to that in other Quadrupeds, is not ascertained ; nor is the exact time at which a Foetus enters the Pouch been hitherto pointed out: but it is observed, that at an early period of pregnancy, a Foetus, scarcely an inch in length, passes from the Uterus through the Vulva into the False Belly, where it adheres by its Mouth to one of the Nipples, placed there for its nourishment. When the Animal arrives at a certain degree of matu- rity, it goesfout of the Pouch, and re-enters it at plea- sure, till it has acquired strength enough to provide for itself. . {See Mr Home's Paper on this subject in Phil.

There is also a Forh-like Bone in these Animals, to which, and to the Clavicle and Scapula, the Os Humeri is fixed as in Birds. This and the other four-footed Reptiles have two Bones in the Fore-Arm, though the division into two is not very distinct. In a Tortoise, the Feet are proportionally small, in consequence of which the Animal is observed to be slow in its motions. There are three Ranges of Bones in the Carpus, the pieces varying in number in the different Ranges. The Phalanges of the Fingers and Toes are nearly as in Mammalia; but in a Sea Tortoise, the different pieces are flat, being formed into a kind of Fins. A Frog and Toad have no motion in the Upper Jaw, and they are destitute of real Teeth, though they have pointed Bodies serving as a substitute, and placed in the Palate ; a Frog has them also in the Upper Jaw. The Head is joined by two Condyles to the Spine, which is short, and terminates behind by a single Bone, articu- lated with the Os Innominatum. The Dorsal Vertebrce have broad Transverse Pro- cesses, that may somewhat supply the place of Ribs, which are wanting here. The Os Sacrum consists of one long Bone. There is one Os Coccygi^ in these Ani- mals. The Scapula is joined to the Sternum by double Cla^ vicles, or there is a Clavicle and Fork-like Bone in each side. The Fore-arm and Leg consist of a single Bone, divided at its extremities into two portions. The Car- pus is formed of three ranges. A Frog has one Bone

The Pharynx and E- sophagus are nearly of the same diameter, and are wider, in proportion to the size of the Stomach, than in the two former classes, and are rendered still wider than at first sight they appear to be, by being full of Rugae, which vanish when the Animal swallows. The Esophagus of a Turtle is covered with long pointed Papillas, of a white colour and firm consistence, and turned towards the Stomach, as if to prevent the Food from returning.

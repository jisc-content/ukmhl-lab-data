[Part VII. OF INSECTS. 364 LarvcB differ from complete Insects, chiefly in their Organs of motion. The Rings or Segments of which their Skin consists, are moved towards each other by Muscular Bands situated within the Body. Some- times they are covered by Bristles or Hooks, which enable them to lay hold more firmly of other sub- stances. Many have Hairs or Spines upon the sur- face of their Body, which are cast off* with the Skin at certain periods, and are afterwards re-produced. The Bodies of many Larva3 have, at their under, and near their fore part, six Feet, each terminating in a hook, by which they can fix themselves, and draw the posterior to the anterior part of their Body. Some have, besides, a number of small Claws, to assist them in their motions. Others crawl by the assistance of hooked Mandibles, and by Tubercles on different parts of their Body. The Bodies of Insects are divided into Head^ Cors- let^ Pectus, Abdomen, and Members. The Head iÂ» joined to the Body, in some, by ball and socket; in others, by plain surfaces; in others, after the manner of a hinge. In some, the connexion is entirely Liga- mentous, the diff'erent motions corresponding with the nature of the Joint. The Corslet or Thorax is situat- ed between the Pectus and Head. The first pair of Feet are joined to this, and it contains the Muscles for moving these and the Head. To the upper and lateral part of the Pectus, the Wings, when present, are fixed, and the four posterior Feet to Its under part. To the upper part a Horny Process is frequently fixed^ termed Sciitelhrn, or Escn-

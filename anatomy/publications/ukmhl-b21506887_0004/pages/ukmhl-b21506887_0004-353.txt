Part V.] OF MOLLUSCA. ' 349 upon the outer extremities of the Horns, though it is not yet fully ascertained whether these parts are real organs of vision. The Muscles which affect them arise from the edges of the Foot of the Animal, and extend as far as the Eyes. By these the Tentacula are drawn to the Head, something after the manner of an invert- ed Finger of a Glove. By a set of Circular Fibres contracting in succession, the Eye is restored to its for- mer external appearance. The Organ of Hearing in a Cuttle-Fish is a simple Bag, concealed in the Annular Cartilage at the base of the great Tentacula. In a Sepia Officinalis, the Sac has a Bone suspended in the Fluid which it contains. In a Sepia Octopus, there is only a chalky substance. The Organ of Smell is supposed to belong to many of the Mollusca, but the situation is unknown. The Lips, in the Animals of this class, are in some short or real Lips; in others, elongated into a Tube or Proboscis. In Cephalopoda, they are in form of a fleshy circle; in Gasteropoda, they are merely a lon- gitudinal Slit. The Proboscis in many Mollusca, as a Whelk, &c. is a fleshy Tube for seizing the Food at a distance. It forms a kind of double cylinder, which can move in every direction, and retract within the Body. The Tongue varies much in length in some of this class, as a Limpet, where it is almost as long as the Body; but in such cases there is no Proboscis. In Cephalopoda and Gasteropoda, the Tongue is covered with Spines directed backwards. Sepia, Snails, and the greater part of Gasteropoda, have a Cartilaginous

Part I.] OF MAMMALIA. 53 Toes touch the ground in supporting the Body, the Metacarpus forms the part commonly called the Fore Leg, the Carpus being termed the Knee. Toes.â€”There are always from three to five Toes in Mammalia. All clawed Quadrupeds have ^ve. Solipeds have one perfect, and two imperfect. Ruminants have two perfect, and two imperfect. Each perfect Finger or Toe has three Bones, except the Thumb or Great Toe, which has never more than two. The Metacarpus and first Phalanx are more curved towards the Palm, and the Phalanx on which the Nails are placed is always rounded, and more pointed than in Man. The Ape tribe have the Thumb separate, and oppos- ed to the other Fingers, but always shorter than in the Human Species. In this respect, a Human Hand is superior to that of every other Animal. The different parts of the Hand are found in several individuals of this class, but less complete than in the Hand of a Human Body, the great superiority of which arises from the size and strength of the Thumb, which can oppose the Fingers in the various offices the Hand has to perform. In the Bat tribe, the Phalanges of the Fingers, be- tween which the Membranes of the Wings are extend- ed, are much elongated, especially the last, which have no Nails ; but the Thumb is short, and furnished with a Claw, in form of a hook, by which the Animal can suspend itself when in a state of rest. The Glires have the Thumb short, but otherwise perfect.

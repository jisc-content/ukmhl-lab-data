Part I.] OF MAMMALIA. 71 ing with the greater length of the Pelvis. The Pecti- neus, in a Dog^ is peculiar for extending to the bot- tom of the Os Femoris. In Cetacea, the Muscles of the Thigh are entirely wanting. Muscles of the Leg.—In Apes, the Muscles here are similar to those in Man, except that corresponding to the Biceps, which has only a single Head. In Ro~ dentia and Carnivora, the Extensors of the Knee are smaller than in Man, while the Flexors are stronger, corresponding with their purposes of walking. The Sartorius and Gracilis form the anterior edge of the Thigh. In all Quadrupeds, the short head of the Muscle analogous to that of the Biceps is wanting; but the single head not only covers a great part of the outer side of the Thigh, and is inserted into the Fi- bula, but gives Fibres to the whole length of the Fas- cia Lata, and performs the office of an Extensor of the Thigh. The Gracilis is large ; the Semimembranosus and Semitendinosus, which are never wanting, are in- serted so much farther down the Tibia than in Manj as to keep the Limb in a state of semi-extension. This is found to be a principal cause in preventing Quadrtr-' peds from walking in an erect attitude. The other Muscles are nearly as in Man. Muscles of the Foot.—The Gastrocnemius is always present, but the Soleus is smaller than in Man ; an Ourang-outanghemg the only Quadruped possessing a real Calf of a Leg. It is remarkably slender in Soli- veds and Ruminants. In Monheys, the Plantaris is continued over the Os Calcis, to the Aponeurosis Plan- taris. The Tibialis Anticus, in Animals which have

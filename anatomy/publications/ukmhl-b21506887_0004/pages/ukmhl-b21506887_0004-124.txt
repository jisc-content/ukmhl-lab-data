[Paiit I. OF THE MOUTH, &c. 120 on account of the necessary force required in their ho- rizontal situation. It exists in all Vertebral Animals, but particularly in Mammalia. In many, as an Ele- phant^ Bear, &c. there is a proper Pharyngeal Muscle, which is merely a continuation of the Muscular Coat of the Esophagus. BursoB Faucium.—Many species of the Ape, and also of the Marmot, are provided with Glandular Sacs, or Cheek Pouches, termed Bursce Faucium, placed behind the Palate, and serving as a temporary reservoir for the Food. A Camel has this structure also, which is supposed to be intended for containing fluids to lubricate the Throat in the sandy deserts. An Ornitliorrynclius is . also found to have Cheek Pouches* In Cetacea, the Pharynx is separated into two by the Larynx, which forms a pyramid that can rise as high as the Posterior Nares, and, by entering these, can allow the aliment to pass by each side of it to the Esophagus. There is also a particular Canal which rises from the Pharynx, and is attached to the margin of the Posterior Nares, or Blowing Holes. The cir- cular Fibres of this Canal form a Sphincter, which, by contracting round the Pyramid of the Larynx, cuts off the communication between the Blowing Holes, Mouth, and Pharynx. Esophagus.—In all the class, the Esophagus is nearly cylindrical, and is continued from the Pharynx to the Stomach. It is long in all, except Cetacea. It is narrow in most, but wide in Animals which swal- low voraciously.

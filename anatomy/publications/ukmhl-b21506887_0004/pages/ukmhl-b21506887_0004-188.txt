184 URINARY AND MALE ORGANS [Part I. The Crura Penis, in Mammalia, are proportionally short. They adhere to the Bones as intimately as in Man. In a Dog and some Apes, there are two Corpora Cavernosa, with a Septum Penis; in others of this last tribe, the Septum is wanting or incomplete. It is ab- sent in Solipeds, Ruminants, and Cetacea, and in most Belluce ; in which case, there is only a single Corpus Cavernosum. In an Elephant, there is a complete Septum. An Ornithorrynchus and Kanguroo are remarkable for having four Crura Penis, and the Urethra in the axis of the Corpora Cavernosa, which form a cylindri- cal ring, with a Septum both above and below it. In several Mammalia, there is a Bone in the Penis, for conducting it into the Vagina. This is found more frequently in such Animals as have no Vesiculae Semi- nales ; in these the copulation being tedious, they turn averse from each other during the emission of the Se- men. But it is found also in some where the Vesiculae are present. It exists in most of the Ape tribe, though here it is small; in Bats, and in several in a Badger, Bear, Weasel, Dog and Cat kind ; in a Seal, and in a Balena among Cetacea. It is wanting in an Opossum, Hyena, Solipeds, Ruminants, and Belluce. V^hen present, it makes part of the walls of the Penis, the Corpora Cavernosa being then less extensive. It is commonly cylindrical, though sometimes furrowed, making part of the Urethra. In a Bear, Dog, &c. it forms a large part of the Penis. In most of the Glires, and \xi a Cat, it is proportionally small.

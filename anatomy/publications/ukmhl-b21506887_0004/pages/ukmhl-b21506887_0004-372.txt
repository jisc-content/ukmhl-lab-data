368 OF INSECTS. [Part VII. opaque Mucus, varying in colour in different Insects. Behind this white spots appear, equal to the number of the Facets of the Cornea. On the back part of this a Choroides is found, which appears to receive a real Re- tina ; but further investigation is necessary to shew how the rays of light can reach the bottom of the Eye, so as to enable the Animal to form distinct vision. In the greater number of Insects, the Eyes appear to be des- titute of motion. The Organ of Hearing has not been found in any of the individuals of this class, though it is not to be doubted that they enjoy the Sense of Hearing, since, in the Males, meansare provided for calling theFemales to them, which are heard by the latter, as is observed in Crickets^ Grasshoppers^ Deatlt-watch^ &c. Neither is there any appearance of an Organ of Smell, though thay give proofs of the existence of this Sense. They discover their Food seemingly by its smell, sometimes even at a considerable distance; and some, as Flesh-Jties, frequently deposite their Ova on Plants, as an Arum Dracuntmm and Stapelia Hirsuta^ which have the smell of Carrion ; though, in such cases, the Mag- gots commonly perish through want. The part which has been considered, by some late Authors, as supply- ing the place of the Organ of Smell, is the Stigma, or entry into the Trachea ; by others, the Antennae have been looked upon as answering this purpose. When Insects are deprived of their Antennje, it has been ob- served that they are incapable of recognizing their haunts, or their Food, though placed close by them. Organ of Taste and Salivation. The seat of the Organ of Taste in Insects is variable. The Under Lip

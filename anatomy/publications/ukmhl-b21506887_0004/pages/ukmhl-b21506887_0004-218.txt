S14 OF THE MUSCLES [Part II. From the surface of the Skin, Excretions take place, as in the former class of Animals, as appears in moulting, and from a quantity of mealy dust being separated in pairing-time. Besides the Layers of the Skin mentioned above. Birds have a Panniculus Carnosus^ which is more dis- tinct in certain kinds, as those which raise their Fea- thers in particular parts of the Body. Besides one broad Muscle, there are Slifs which run in different directions, and act upon the Skin and Feathers over them. The Feathers are the peculiar covering of Birds. They protect them from the inclemency of the weather, and serve them for flying. In Water Fowls, the Fea- thers are besmeared with an oily fluid, which prevents the water from injuring them. Upon certain parts of the Integuments there are Glands, that separate an oily matter, with which they anoint their Feathers. These are found under the Skin of the crop ; but the greater part of this substance is discharged, by one or more orifices, from a Gland si- tuated upon the Rump. With the contents of this, a Duch, by means of the Bill, frequently besmears the Feathers. The Feathers are wanting in young Birds. When they first leave the Egg, they are covered with Hair, formed into Fasciculi, each of which grows from a com- mon Bulb, that gives origin to the future Feathers. The Hair is soon succeeded by Sheaths, giving pas- sage to the Feathers, the inner ends of which are sup- plied with Blood-vessels, that form, first the Barrel, then the Stalk of the Quills. The inner part of the Feathers is at first composed of

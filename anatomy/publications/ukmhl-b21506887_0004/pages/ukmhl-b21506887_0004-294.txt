m OF THE LIVER, kc. [Part III. The Anus, in some, as a Tortoise, is placed under the Tail. In others, as a Frog and Toad, which have no Tail, it is above the extremity of the Back. There are some varieties in the situation and attach- ments of the Mesentery. In a Tortoise, it is conti- nued from the IMesocolon, and is not connected direct- ly to the Vertebras. In Lizards, the Mesentery and Mesocolon come off from the Vertebrae. Serpents have no Mesocolon Transversum. Reptiles in general may be said to want the Omen- tum, yet many Lizards have a substance resembling it charged with Fat; and the Fatty Lobes, attached to the Testicles and Ovaria of Frogs, are considered by some as a kind of Omentum, while others think them connected with the parts of Generation, on account of the great increase of bulk at pairing-time. OF THE LIVER, PANCREAS, AND SPLEEN. The Liver is present in the whole class, and is pro- portionally larger than in Mammalia or Birds, extend- ing generally to both Hypochondriac regions. It is still less divided than in Birds. It is connected to the Body by the Peritoneum, as m Mammalia. The colour is commonly bordering upon yellow.

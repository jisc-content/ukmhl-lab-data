Part Vll.] OF INSECTS. 367 the Body, forming, in its course, ten or twelve Gan- glia, from which, and from the Brain, Nerves go off to the different parts of the Animal. In perfect Insects, the Brain has generally two- Lobes, and is also situated above the Esophagus. The Nerves and Ganglia, in some Insects, are similar in number, general appearance, and distribution, to those of Larvag; in others, they vary considerably in all these respects. jEz/^.â€”There are two kinds of Eyes in this tribe of Animals, some small and simple, and termed Stemmata, varying from two to eight in number ; others are large, appearing like a collection of smaller Eyes, but are Qnly two in number. These are divided, in some Insects, into many hundred hexagonal convex surfaces, which appear like so many different Corneae or Lenses. The simple Eyes are found in most of the Aptera, and in the Larvae of many winged insectsj but are too small for examination. When the Larvse change into complete Insects, they change also their simple for compound Eyes. Several Genera of winged Insects and Aptera^ 'are observed to have simple besides compound Eyes ; many Insects, on the other hantd, have no Eyes. The Eyes of Insects have no Eye-lids, are commonly im- moveable, and, according to Swammerdam, do not contain the same Humours which are found in the higher classes of Animals. The appearance of the Eyes of Insects are so diffe-^ rent from those in other classes, that experience alone shews them to be Eyes. This is put to the test by covering them, or cutting them out, after which the Animal can no longer find its way. The Cornea of compound Eyes is lined with an

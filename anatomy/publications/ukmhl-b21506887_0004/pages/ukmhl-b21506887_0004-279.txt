Part III ] OF REPTILES. ^75 s 2 In a Lizard^ th,e Skin over the Tympanum, like the Cornea over the Eye, is known from its transparency ; but in many, as a Chameleon^ the Membrana Tympani is wanting, or cannot be distinguished from the rest of the Skin. It is wanting, also, in the generality of Serpents. A Tympanum^ Eustachian Tube, arid Semicircular Canals, are present in a Turtle, Frog, and in most Lizards. In a Turtle, the Tympanum is in some measure divided into two parts by a contraction, which is more distinct in a Crocodile, where the inner apart- ment has Cells, somewhat like those in the Mastoid Pro- cess in the Human Species, but larger. In Lizards, a Frog, Toad, &c. the Tympanum is Membranous be- hind, and has a short but large Eustachian Tube, which communicates with the Mouth. There is neither Tympanum nor Eustachian Tube in Serpents, and a few others ; but a rudiment of a Carti- laginous Ossiculum exists in some, which is inclosed in Muscular matter, the inner extremity occupying the Fenestra Ovalis. In a Turtle and Lizards^ as in Birds, there is a simple Ossiculum Auditus, with a small Cartilaginous Stalk, which is joined to the Membrana Tympani. A Frog and Toad have two Cartilaginous Ossicula, one joined to the Membrana Tympani, the other articulated with it, and with the Fenestra Ovalis. In Serpents, there is a rudiment of an Ossiculum, the outer end of which touches the Skin, the inner, the Fe- nestra Ovalis. Of the Muscles of the Ossicula, little is known in Reptiles.

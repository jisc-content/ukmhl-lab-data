OF THE BONES. [Part I. 42 Os Hyoides. The Os Hyoides has the same parts in general as in Man. It can be divided into Body and Cornua ; but in many Animals, the long Cornua are so united with the Body, as not to be distinguished from it. Those corresponding to the small x\ppendices in Man are here larger than the other Cornua, and, being articulated before them, are distinguished by the name of Anterior, the other being called the Posterior. The first are fixed, on each side, to the Styloid Process of the Tem- poral Bone, or to a slender Bone supplying its place. In an Ourang-outang, the Os Hyoides is nearly as in Man. It varies in other Apes. In Carnivora, it is generally long and slender. In SoUpeds, the Poste- rior Cornua and Body form an Arch, from which a long Process descends ; the Anterior Cornua are short, and are directed forward to be articulated with the Styloid Processes. In Ruminants, the Posterior Cornua unite with the Body into an Arch, which has a Tuberosity in the middle of its inferior part ; the Anterior Cornua have each two pieces of unequal length, the short one being articulated with the Styloid Processes. In Amphibious Quadrupeds, as a Seal, the Body of the Os Hyoides is slender ; the Posterior Cornua are continued in an Arch with the Body ; the Anterior are formed of three Bones. The Cetacea have also their Os Hyoides; with its Anterior and Posterior Cornua, which are of consider- able length, and of a particular form.

[Part I. OF THE LARYNX, &c. 142 ed together by Cellular Substance, but do not commu- nicate with each other, except through the medium of the Larynx. Many of the other Apes and Baboons^ though not the whole, have also in their throats large single or double Sacs of different forms, communicating with the La- rynx by one or two Foramina, between the Os Hyoides and Thyroid Cartilage. These Sacs vary in size in dif- ferent individuals, and become larger as the Animal ad- vances in years. During respiration, part of the air enters thesCj which in time of crying are dilated, but can afterwards collapse by the pressure of the surround- ing Muscles. It is supposed by some, that the voice of these Animals is rendered proportionally weak, from part of the air getting into the Sacs. In American Monkeys, the Arytenoid Cartilages are diminutive, and turned back; the Cuneiform Car- tilages, and Cellular Substance, on each side, form anteriorly a cushion, which touches its fellow; and, with the other parts of the Larynx, they compose a strait passage, turned like an which gives the flute-like voice in Whistling Monkeys. Howling Apes have the anterior part of the Os Hyoides formed into a spherical cavity, by which the tones are produced that are heard at a great distance. The principal differences in the Larynx, among the other orders of this class, are the following : In an Ant-eater^ which is observed to be dumb, Blu- MENBACH found the Larynx entirely Osseous. In an Ornithorrynchns, each of the Ventricles has only one Ligament of the Glottis. Among Gllres, some, as a 'Porcupine^ have scarce-

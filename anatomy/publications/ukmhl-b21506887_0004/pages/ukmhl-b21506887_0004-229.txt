OF BIRDS. Part IL] the Membrana Tympani, and divides into slender Crura, which unite again in a plate that fills the Fenes- tra Ovalis. There is only one Muscle belonging to the Square Bone, It is situated in the Occiput, behind the Ear, and, penetrating the walls of the Tympanum, is so fix- ed to this small Bone, as to stretch the Membrana Tym- pani. The EustachianTuhe is conical, and entirely Osseous. It runs from the Tympanum to the Palate, where it terminates by an opening common to it and its fellow, behind the Internal Nares. Of the two Foramina by which the Tympanum com- municates with the Labyrinth, the Fenestra Rotunda is the larger, contrary to what happens in Mammalia. The Tympanum, m many Birds, particularly in an Owl, communicates with three large Cavities inclosed in the Osseous Plates. These again communicate by an equal number of openings with the Tympanum in the same side, while one extends over the Occiput to its fellow on the other side, and another goes under the Pituitary Gland to the corresponding one on the oppo- site side. In night Birds of prey, these Cavities are very large. In those which seek their prey in the day-time, and in Gallinacea, they do not communicate on the opposite sides of the Head. In Aquatic Birds, they are gene- rally small. In Parroquets^ they have not been dis- covered. The Labyrinth is distinguished by the Semicircular Canals projecting from the base of the Cranium, and in such a manner, that, in many Birds, they are visible VOL. IV. p

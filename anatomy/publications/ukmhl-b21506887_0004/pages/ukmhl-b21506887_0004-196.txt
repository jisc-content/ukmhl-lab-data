â€¢ 192 OF THE FEMALE ORGANS [Part I. frequently in a Horse, Sheep, and Black Cattle, least of all in the Human Species. This production in the higher classes of Animals has been considered as the effect of chance, as no instance has yet been found where there was a complete set of Male and Female parts in the same individual, but partly the one and partly the other, forming a mixture of both. In Black Cattle, it appears an established principle in their propagation. It is now well known, that when a Cow produces Twins, one a Male, the other a Female in appearance, the Male becomes a complete Bull, the Female is called a Free Martin, and has not the power of propagating. They are preserved in England to yoke with the oxen, or to fatten for the Table, for which last purpose they are found to exceed an Ox and Heifer in the delicacy of their flesh. In these Animals'the Testicles and Ova- ria are too incomplete to perform their office. In some the Testicles are found in place of Ovaria ; in others, both Testicles and Ovaria are present, and placed in the situation of the latter; sometimes the Vagina, at other times the Uterus, is deformed, or even wanting; and in all such cases the Animal is incapable of pro- ducing its like.

The Os Tinccn, in all the different Mammalia, is closed soon after Impregnation,by a Glu- tinous Mucilaginous Matter, secreted by Glands or Fol- licles, which cuts off all communication between the

[Part I. OF THE LIVER, &c. 168 monly a Pyriform appearance, as in a Human Body ; but in many it is round or cylindrical. ^ The Biliary Ducts, in the Ape kind, are furnished with Cells in the Cystic Duct, the same as in Man. In other Mammalia, they have a smooth appearance; a Kanguroo Giant, however, has numerous Glands and Cells in the Hepatic Duct. The Ducts vary much, inMammalia, in theirnumber, manner of uniting, and in their termination. When a Gall-bladder is present, the Hepatic Ducts commonly unite into one Trunk, which communicates with the Cystic ; in other cases, they join it in succession. The Ducts terminate in the Duodenum, after piercing the Gut obliquely, much after the same manner as in a Human Body. The distance of the termination varies in different Animals. In Glires, in general, it is found to be the least; yet in a Kanguroo Giant, among this tribe of Animals, it is the greatest, though some Authors have supposed, that the Biliary Ducts ter- minated nearest the Pylorus in voracious Animals. In an Ornithorrynchus, two Branches of the Hepatic Duct unite with the Cystic near the Neck of the Gall- bladder. In some of the Bat kind, in Rats, and in a Porcupine and Hedge-hog, many Hepatic Ducts join the Cystic near each other, or in succession. A Mole has two Hepatic Ducts, one of which receives the Cystic, then unites with the other to form the common Duct. In a Seal, one branch of the Hepatic Duct joins the Cystic near the Neck of the Gall-bladder ; the second unites with the Cystic near the insertion in the Intestine, and the Cystic Duct appears to form the common one. The Martin kind have the common Duct dilated into

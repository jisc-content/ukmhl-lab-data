PART IV. OF FISHES. OF THE BONES. Fishes have in general a Spine, extending from the Cranium to the Tail Fins, and have the Fins at the under part of the Belly articulated with Bones pecu- liar to them. The Bones of the Cranium are firmly united together by indistinct Sutures. In Osseous Fishes, the Bones are very numerous; but in several of the Cartilagi- nous, as a Skate^ the Cranium is chiefly in one con- tinued piece. In general, the Cranium bears a small proportion to the rest of the Head, but is large when compared with the size of the Brain it incloses. It is not marked in the inside by the Brain, not being moulded upon it as in Mammalia. The Cranium of Osseous Fishes is broad between the Ears, these Organs being continued in the same com- mon Cavity with the Brain. In Cartilaginous Fishes, the Ears are separated by a distinct Septum.

OF THE NOSE. [Part I. 108 where the Maxillary Bone does not form a Plate under the Orbit. In a Horse^ there are two large Maxillary Sinuses on each side, the one behind the other, each opening by a separate passage into the Nose. These Sinuses are very large in Pecora ; they are wanting in a Hog^ but their place seems to be supplied by a Si- nus in the base of the Os Malae. In an Elephant^ they are divided, like the Bones of the Cranium, into numerous Cells which communicate with each other, and terminate by a common passage in the Nose. The Foramina in the Cribriform Plate of the Eth- moid Bone, in different Quadrupeds, are so unequal in size, that the part assumes the appearance of Fine Lace, and their number is considered to be in proportion to the acuteness of the sense of smelling. They are large and numerous in an Elephant and Hind, but abound most in Animals of the Carnivorous kind. Ossa Spongiosa.â€”The Conchae, or Ossa Spongiosa, are more convoluted in other Mammalia than in Man; which affording a larger surface for the expansion of the Membrana Pituitaria and the distribution of the Olfactory Nerves, contributes to increase the power of smell. Hence most of the Eerce, and Pecora in gene- ral, having more complicated Ossa Spongiosa, are ob- served to possess a greater acuteness in this sense. In SoUpeds, Pecora, and Belluce^ the superior or an- terior Spongy Bone is formed in each side by one of the Cells of the Ethmoid Bone, which extends to the Os Spongiosum Inferius, and is placed over it like tiles on a roof. In most of these Animals, its convolutions

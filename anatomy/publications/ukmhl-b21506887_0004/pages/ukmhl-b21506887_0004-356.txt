352 OF MOLLUSCA. [Part V. or contracting, can admit or expel the air. In the rest of the Gasteropoda, the orifice varies considerably in its situation, being in the back in some, in the breast in others. Some of the Acephalous Mollusca, as an Oyster^ have their Lungs in form of Gills, which represent leaves, each with a double Lamina, and a double Se- ries of Vessels. Alimentary Canal.-^The Alimentary Canal, in Mol- lusca, consists, as in more perfect Animals, of an Eso- phagus, Stomach, and Intestines, but the beginning and termination of the Canal varies considerably in situation in different individuals. In a Sepia Octopus of the Mollusca Cephalopoda, the Esophagus, having passed the Cartilaginous Ring of the Neck, dilates into first, second, and third Stomachs, which somewhat resemble those of Granivorous Birds. In a Sepia Officinalis and LoligO) there is only a single Stomach or Gizzard. In Gasteropoda in general, the Canal is in form of a Eunnel; the most simple is in a Slug and Snail. The Stomach, in these, is of considerable size, and the Intestines make a couple of turns in their course through the Body. In many of the Mollusca, particularly among Acephala, the Esophagus expands into a Crop, which is covered internally by small Teeth. A Bulla Lignaria contains three Teeth of such strength, that the Animal masticates other Testacea, upon which it lives. The Anus, in Mollusca, varies considerably in situation among the difi^erent Genera or SpecieS' In a Cuttle-FisJi, it is at the fore part of the Neck; in a Slug and Snail, close to the Air-hole ; in a Limpet, it is upon the top of the Head; and in Acephala in general, opposed to the Mouth.

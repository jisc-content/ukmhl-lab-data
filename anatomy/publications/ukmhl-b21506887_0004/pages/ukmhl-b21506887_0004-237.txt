Part II.] OF BIRDS. 233 structure is also the same as in the former class of Ani- mals ; but this system differs from that in Mammalia, in the Chyle being colourless and transparent, and in there being no visible Lymphatic Glands, neither in the Mesentery, nor, in general, any where else, but at the bottom of the Neck ; though, in some of the lar- ger Birds, a few Glands have been found in other parts of the Body. The Lymphatics of Birds have numerous communi- cations with each other, and form Insulce, which are more frequent than in Mammiferous Animals. The Lymphatics of the Inferior Extremities, of the Pelvis, and of the Organs of Urine and Generation, and also those of the Chylopoietic and Assistant Chylo- poietic Viscera, join about the Coeliac Artery, and form a Plexus. From this are sent out two Thoracic Ducts, nearly of equal size, which advance under the Lungs, at each side of the Spine, and go to the inner part of the right and left Jugular Veins, where they terminate a little beyond the union of these Vessels with the Axillaris. The Thoracic Duct of the Left Side receives a Branch fromthe Ventriculus Succenturiatus and Esophagus, and likewise the Lymphatics of the corresponding wing. The Absorbents of the Head and Neck accompany the Blood-vessels, and join near the lower part of the Neck, on each side, to form a Trunk, which penetrates a Lymphatic Gland. From the opposite side of this Gland another Trunk issues, which, in the left side, terminates in the corresponding Thoracic Duct, while in the right, part of it goes to the Thoracic Duct, and part to the Jugular Vein, near the Angle which it forms with the Axillary.

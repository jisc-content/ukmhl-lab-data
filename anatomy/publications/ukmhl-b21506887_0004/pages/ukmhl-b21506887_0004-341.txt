OF FISHES. 337 Pi^KT IV.] sion in some part of the Gall-bladder or its Ducts, or into both at the same time. The Hepato-Cjstic Ducts are commonly short, which facilitates the motion of the Bile. In a Turhot, Cat-fish^ &c. these Ducts are numerous, and go into the Gall-bladder. In an Eel^ Sole^ Perch, and many others, they go in succession into the Cystic Duct. In a Skate, Salmon, &c. they go partly to the Gall-bladder, and partly to the Cystic Duct. Pancreas.—In Osseous Fishes, there is no other Pancreas than the Intestinula Caeca formerly described. They send two large Canals into the Intestines, and when these are wanting, as in the case of a Carp, he. the walls of the Intestines discharge abundance of Humour from Glands placed upon their inner surface. In Cartilaginous Fishes, as a Skate, there is a Pan- creas resembling that in the former classes of Ani- mals. It is of an irregular form, and is placed at the origin of the Intestines. The substance appears com- pact, but Gelatinous, when cut. In a Sturgeon, the Pancreas forms a sort of medium between that in a Skate, and the Intestinula C^ca in Osseous Fishes; it opens into the Intestine by th^ee large Orifices, and has internally a singular reticulated appearance. Spleen.—The Spleen gradually diminishes in propor- tional size from IMammalia to Fishes. In a Raja and Squalus, it is placed on the Stomach; in some it is fixed to the first part of the Intestines; in others, between the Stomach and Liver; in a great number, it is under the Air-bag, and above the other Bowels : In all, it is fixed in its place by the Peritoneum.

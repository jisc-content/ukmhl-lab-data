Paut IV.] OF FISHES, 309 dock^ and Whitings there are numerous small roundish Bodies, contained in little Vesicles on the surface of the Brain, on the anterior extremity of the Spinal Mar- row, and on some of the principal Nerves, and within the Skin covering the Fins. These are described by Dr Monro in his Work on Fishes, but their use is unknown. The Olfactory Nerves, in certain Fishes, as a Skate and Shark, are so large at their origin, as by some to have been considered the proper Brain, or at least its Anterior Lobes. At their roots, each forms a large Bulb, from which the Nerve passes towards the Nares. In some, the Nerve is at first slender, and afterwards forms a large Ganglion ; in others, it is thick and short, and surrounded with Cortical Substance. It terminates by a Ganglion, which is separated from the Nostril by a Cribriform Membrane, that gives passage to the Nerves into the Nose. In Osseous Fishes, the Olfactory Nerves are long and slender, in some surrounded by Cartilage, in others by Membrane. The Genera Cyprinus and Gadus have, at the Nasal extremity of the Nerve, a spherical Gan-J glion, composed in part of Cineritious Substance. The Optic Nerves, in the generality of Fishes, par- ticularly in those of the Osseous kind, cross each other without being incorporated. They are attached merely by Cellular Substance, the Right Nerve going to the Left.Eye, and the Left Nerve to the Right Eye. In some Fishes, they are Fibrous; in others, they have a laminated or plaited appearance. The Third and Fourth Pairs are dispersed nearly as in the former classes of Animals. The Fifth comes off

PartIII.J of reptiles. ^83 The Pulmonary Veins unite in one Trunk, which goes into a similar Reservoir; and this opens into the Left Auricle, where there is also a Valve. In the Lizard and Serpent tribe, there is only one Posterior, but two Anterior Cavoe, which open into a similar Reservoir; and this goes into the Auricle by a chink v/hich has two V^alves. The Pulmonary Veins are similar to those of the former order. In Serpents^ there is but one Pulmonary Vein, which goes into the Left Auricle. In a Frog and Salamander^ the Veins have a distri- bution similar to the Arteries. There are two Anterior Cavae, and a Cava Posterior. OF THE ABSORBENTS. As in Birds, the Transparency here, joined to the want of Glands, long prevented the Absorbents from being discovered. The structure is similar to that in the Animals of the former class, and, like the Absorbents, in these also, they have numerous Valves, but no Glands are found in any part of the system.

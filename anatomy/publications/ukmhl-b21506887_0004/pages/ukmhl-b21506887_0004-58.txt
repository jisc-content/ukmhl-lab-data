OF THE BONES. [Part I. 54 In Ferce, the Toe, resembling a Human Thumb, is on the same plane with the other Toes; of course they have not the power of grasping any thing. In some, as a Bear, Badger, &c. it is almost equal in length. In a Dogy Cat, &c. it is shorter. Each of the Bones of the last Phalanx in a Lion^ Tiger, Cat, &c. is remarkable in having the fore part in form of a hook, which receives the Claw as in a sheath. The back part forms two Processes, to which the Muscles are attached, that can at once extend the Claw and bend the Phalanx. In Ruminants, the single Metacarpal Bone supports the two Toes which form the part termed Cloven Foot, Several species have besides two little Bones, frequent- ly covered with Nails, which represent two other Toes; but these are so short as not to touch the ground. There is here also a small Bone which forms a Rudiment of the Thumb. In Solipeds, the only vestige of the lateral Toes, are the two sharp-pointed Styloid Bones, on each side of the Canon Bone. The three Bones of the single Toe are termed Pastern, Coronet, and Coffin Bones; the last of which is received into the Hoof. At the back part of the Pastern are also two Sesamoid Bones. The Coffin Bone has a piece connected to it, under the name of Shuttle-Bone. An Elephant has five perfect Toes, but they are al- most entirely concealed by the Skin of the Foot. In web-footed Quadrupeds, as an Otter and Seal, and in the Pectoral Fins of Cetacea, the Bones analo- gous to those of the Hand, are in a flattened form, and, in the latter kind of Animals, are often in a state

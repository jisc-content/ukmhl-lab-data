366 OF INSECTS. [Part VII. only two, some none. In some, they are purely Mem- branous ; others have them covered with Farinaceous Scales of different colours. In Coleoptera, &c. the Scales of the Wings, and in Lepidoptera and some others, those of the Body, are small Horny Plates, laid over each other like the tiles on a house. The Muscles that move the V^ings, are not well as- certained. Some are small and short, and are suppos- ed to extend or to fold them; others are larger, for elevating or depressing them. Epidermis.—Insects in general, whether in the per- fect or imperfect state, possess an Epidermis. In a Larva, it is found to Be several times shed before the Chrysalis state takes place. It varies in thickness in different Insects. In those living in water, it is com- monly of a Mucous nature. Perfect Insects have no Cutis, of course no Papillae Nervosa. Their Palpi or Feelers are considered as proper Organs of Touch, by which the Animal examines surrounding objects. The Corpus Mucosum is placed between the Cuticle and Muscles in Larvce, and is supposed to give origin to the colour of Insects. In some, as the Fire-Flies in America, there is a Gelatinous shining colour, which gives light in the night. Brain and Nervous System.—The Brain, in Insects, may be considered as the anterior extremity of the Spi- nal Marrow, slightly enlarged. In Larvas of large Insects, the Brain consists of one or more Lobes in a Horny Cavity in the Head. From these Lobes commonly two Nerves descend, and, embracing the Esophagus, unite into a Cord ana- logous to the Spinal Marrow. This extends through

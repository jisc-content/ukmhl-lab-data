[Part I. 88 OF THE BRAIN. Yitdd, in the substance of the Cerebellum, has a\ consi- derable resemblance to that in a Human Brain. The Tubercula Quadrigemina are larger, hence bet- ter named Nates and Testes in a Quadruped, espe- cially in Herbivora, than in Man, though they are more nearly of the same size in an Jpe. The Nates are Cortical, and the Testes Medullary externally, as in Man. In Carnivorous Animals, the Testes are gene- rally larger than the Nates. In a Dolphin, they are triple the size. In Herbivora, the Nates, on the con- trary, are much larger than the Testes, and are of a round form. The Pineal Gland, in Quadrupeds, is si- milar to that in Man, but is generally more conical and pointed. The Acervulus Cerebri, so frequently occur- ring in, or near, the Pineal Gland in a Human Brain, is seldom met with here. It has been seen in some of the Pecora, as a Fallow Deer and Goat. The inequalities at the Base of the Brain are much less considerable than in Man. The Tuber Annulare is less prominent. In Carnivora, there are two Cor- pora Albicantia; in Herbivora, there is only one of these bodies. The Corpora Pyramidalia are consider- ably longer than in the Human Species. Of the Cerebral Nerves. There is nothing very particular in the origins of the Cerebral Nerves within the Cranium, excepting the Ol- factory. These, in the Ape tribe only, resemble those in Man. In other Quadrupeds, they form two large Emi- nences termed Processus Mammillares, which are chiefly of a Cineritious nature, and fill the Fossa of the Ethmoid

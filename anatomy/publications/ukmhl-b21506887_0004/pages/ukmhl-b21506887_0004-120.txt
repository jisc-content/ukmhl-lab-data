In Solipeds, the Papillae Conicas of the Tongue are small and compact; the Fungiform are only found in ^ the sides of this Organ, the space behind resembling that in Man. In most Pecora, as an Oo?, &c. the Papillae Conicae covering the fore part of the Tongue, terminate each in a horny, flexible Filament, turned backwards, assist- ing, as in the Tongue of many other Animals, to lay hold of the Food. The posterior part of the Tongue is covered with Tuberculated Papillae, which in some individuals are numerous. Among the Cetaceous tribe, the Tongue in a Dol- phin has no distinct Conical Papillae.

They differ only in shape, in pro- portional size, in colour, and in the direction of their Excretory Ducts. They are observed to be small in Fercc, where there is little mastication, larger in Glires, and largest of all in SoUpeds, and Ruminants, which grind their Food. In the Ape kind, the Parotid Gland is remarkably

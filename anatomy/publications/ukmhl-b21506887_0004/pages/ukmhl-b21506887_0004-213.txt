The Lateral Muscles in particular, acting together, expand the Feathers in the Tail, so as to produce that beautiful fan-like appearance) so remark- able in a Turkey^ Peacock^ and Pheasant, Of the Muscles of the Ribs, the Scalenus is analo- gous to the Levatores Costarum, which extend from the transverse processes of the Vertebrae, to the anterior edges of the Ribs. The Intercostales and Triangu- lares bear a considerable resemblance to those in Man. Birds have no Diaphragm. There are three Layers of Abdominal Muscles, the two outer of which run more in a transverse direction than in the Human Species. The Recti and Pyramidales are wanting. Muscles of the Superior Extremity.â€”The Muscles of the Scapula are the same in number with those in Mam- malia ; but the Trapezius and Rhomboides are small, their origin being chiefly confined to the Spine of the Back. Birds have three Pectoral Muscles, all arising from the very large Sternum, and fixed to the Scapu- lary extremity of the Humerus. The First, or Great Pectoral, with its fellow, which weighs more than all the other Muscles taken collectively, arises from the Furcula, the Keel of the Sternum, and the last Ribs, and is inserted into a prominent Linea Aspera of the Os Humeri. By depressing this Bone, the Muscle pro- duces the quick and powerful motions of the Wing in flying. The Second, or Middle Pectoral, is situated under the former, and sends a Tendon over the union of the Scapula, Furcula, and Clavicle, as over a pulley, to elevate the Humerus, and balance the Animal in its flight. The Third, or Smallest Pectoral, arises from VOL. IV. o

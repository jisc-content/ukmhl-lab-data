174 OF THE BLADDER. [Part I. part \yhich transmitp the Urine forms a Cavity, the surface of which, however, is pale, like that of the Papillae. In many Animals, as a SquirreU Hare, &c. there is but one Papilla ; in some of the Rat kind, two; in the deeply-divided Kidneys, commonly one in each Lobe ; and in a Bear, each Lobe is found to have two Papillae. The number of Infundibula corresponds with that of the Papillae ; when these are absent, the Pelvis is joined to the edges of the surface which sends out the Urine, and then, as happens in a Cat, it does not ap- pear beyond the Kidney. In a Bear, and other Animals with Conglomerated Kidneys, the Infundibula unite in succession, and go to the Ureter without forming a Pelvis. The Ureters agree, in Mammalia in general, in their course, size, proportional length, structure, and termi- nation. In Lobulated Kidneys; the Arteries do not all go to the Sinus of the Kidney, many of them taking a more direct course towards the Lobes to which they are destined. Renal Glands. The Renal Gland is generally situated at the inner part of the Kidney, and varies in proportional size al- most in every Species, but it appears to change with age much less than in Man. Its use in Mammalia in general, as in a Human Body, has not been discover- ed, though it is considered here also as subservient to the Kidney.

Tarsus.â€”In Quadrupeds with Toes, the Tarsal Bones have a near resemblance to those in Man ; they differ only in a few particular circumstances. In Mon- l^eys, strictly so called, the Os Calcis generally wants the Tuberosity of the Heel, at its Posterior Extremity; and the Tarsus is articulated with the Leg Bones, in such an oblique manner, that the Foot rests more on its outer edge than on the Sole. In some of the Lemurs, the Os Calcis and Os Scaphoides are so long, as to give the Foot the appearance of a Hand. In Carnivora, the Ginglymus at the lower end of the Tibia is more complete than in Man. The Heel is longer, and quite straight, in those that walk only on the Toes. In a Mole, the Tibia alone is articulated with the Tarsus. Rodentia have the Os Calcis much elongated. In some Animals, as an Opossum and Beaver, the Tarsus has a Supernumerary Bone on its inner side. Solipeds have only two Cuneiform Bones in the Tar- sus. In Ruminants, the Scaphoid and Cuboid Bones are united together, except in a Camel, which has them distinct. The Tarsus of the three-toed Sloth has only four Bones, viz. the Os Calcis, the Astragalus, and two Cu- neiform Bones. The Astragalus is articulated with the Fibula, with the Os Calcis, and the Great Cuneiform Bone, in such a manner, that the Foot possesses only lateral motion, but which is perfectly adapted to the re-

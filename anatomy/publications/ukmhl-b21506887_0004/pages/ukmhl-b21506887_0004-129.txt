Part I.] OF MAMMALIA. 125 Tooth, in consequence of which Cavities are left, which become filled with extraneous matter. The Enamel in the centre of the Incisores of a Horse has no Crusta Petrosa, but is filled with black- ish Tartar, which extends only a short way into the Tooth, of course soon disappears, in consequence of mastication. This is termed by Farriers the filling up of the Teeth, or rather Mark of the Mouth, and forms a criterion of the Aniraal's age. In many Animals which do not ruminate, as Solipeds and an Elephant, the Bodies or Crowns of the Molares have their grinding surfaces placed nearly in a hori- zontal direction. In Ruminants, their surface is some- what oblique, the outer margin of the Upper, and the inner margin of the Under Tooth, being the most pro- minent. In the greater part of Ferae, especially of the T>og and Tiger kind, where the Molares are of an ir- regular wedge shape, the lower ones close within the upper, and act like scissars, and this denotes the na- ture of the food upon which the Animal lives. AH the three sets of Teeth exist in the Ape tribe, in Carnivora, in Solipeds, and in Ruminants naturally destitute of horns, and in Belluce, except an Elephant and two-horned Rhinoceros ; but in the Human Species only, are the three sets disposed in an uninterrupted series, and the Teeth of one Jaw placed at early age directly opposite those of the other. The Fore Teeth of the Upper Jaw are wanting in Horned Cattle, and also the Canine, except a Stag, which has rudiments of the latter, and a Musk Ani-^

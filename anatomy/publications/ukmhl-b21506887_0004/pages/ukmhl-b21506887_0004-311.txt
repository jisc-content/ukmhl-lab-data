In Osseous Fishes, as a Cod, HaddocJc, &c. the Mucus which besmears their Skin, comes from a Linea Lateralis, or Duct, on each side of the Body and Head, and extends as far back as the Tail Fin. Upon the Head, the Duct divides into Branches, which spread out upon the two Jaws. The vessel running along the side of the Body is placed a little higher than another, which belongs to the Absorbent System. From the Ducts a number of short Tubes arise, and terminate by openings^ upon the surface of the Skin. CuviEii describes these Ducts as arising from two Glands placed on the Head, above each Orbit, OF THE BRAm, ^c. TThe appearance of the Brain differs much in the dif- ferent Species. It is always remarkably small in pro_ portion to the size of the Body, though the Nerves are as large, when compared with the parts on which they are distributed, as in the former classes. The Brain here never fills the Cranium, there being always a large space occupied by a salt fluid, contained in loose Cellular substance, which surrounds that Or- gan, and supplies the place of the Ttinica Arachnoid ea- u g

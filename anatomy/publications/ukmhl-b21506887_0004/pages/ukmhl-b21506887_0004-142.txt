They differ a little in the distribution of their Glands, and in the origin, course, and termina- tion of their principal Trunk, the Thoracic Duct. The chief parts of the Absorbent System were first discovered in Quadrupeds, the subjects for examination being more readily come at here, and the contents of the Lacteals being of the same white colour as in a Human Body. The Lymphatics in Quadrupeds, as in Man, have been seen in the different parts of the Body, excepting the Brain and Spinal Marrow, in which their existence also, as in a Human Body, has not yet been ascer- tained. In the Posterior Extremities of the larger Animals, as a Horse, they are easily traced ; and in the Inter- nal Viscera, in some Animals, as an Ox, they can be

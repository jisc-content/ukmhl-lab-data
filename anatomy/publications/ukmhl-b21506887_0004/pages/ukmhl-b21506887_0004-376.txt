OF INSECTS. [Part VII. 372 the Bile. The Ducts terminate commonly near the Stomach, but now and then in a more distant part of the Intestines. The Spleen is wanting here, but in Larvae, and in some perfect Insects, particularly in those that spend a considerable part of their time in a torpid state, a large Adipose substance occupies a considerable portion of the Body, and exists in great abundance in the Larvae of Insects. It has been considered by some as an O- mentum, though a real Omentum, such as is found in many Animals, does not exist in this class. Insects have neither Pancreas, nor Kidneys, nor Blad- der of Urine, their different secretions being performed by loose Vessels, which float in the Abdomen. By means of these, various fluids are secreted, some of which have a faetid, and others a pleasant smell. A Bee, Wasp, &c. have two Vesicles situated at the bottom of their Sting, which throw out a very acrid fluid, that the Ani- mal can discharge at pleasure through a perforation in the point of the Sting. ' In a Bee, the Sting is barbed at the point, and commonly remains in the wound it inflicts. A Scorpion throws a fluid of a dangerous na- ture, also, through its sting. Some Spiders discharge a fluid, which renders their bite dangerous. Organs of Generation.â€”The greater number of In- sects have the external parts of Generation situated at the posterior part of the Abdomen. In Spiders, with a few'exceptions, they are placed in the Palpi Maxilla- res. The Male Organs in general have a Spermatic Vessel something analogous to Testes, two Vesicular Seminales, and a Penis inclosed in a Sheath. The Testes and Vesiculae vary extremely in diff*erent Genera,

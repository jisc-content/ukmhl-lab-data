Ul Part I.] OF MAMMALIA. OF THE LARYNX, ^c. The Larynx agrees, in its general structure, with that in Man. It differs chiefly according to the form of the Cartilages, the size and form of the VentricleSj and of certain Sacs connected with these in particular Animals. Most of the class have a Muscle peculiar to the Epi- glottis, and termed Hyo-Epiglottideus. It is common- ly cylindrical; arises by two portions from the Base of the Anterior Cornua of the Os Hyoides, and is insert^ ed into the middle of the Epiglottis, which it serves to raise from the Glottis. The Epiglottis exists in Mammalia, in general, with very few exceptions. It is so small in the Bat tribe, as to be scarcely observable. It appears to be deficient or very small, also, in some of the Mouse-like Animals^ as a Glis Esculentis, or Mel Mouse, In the Ape tribe, the Larynx differs little from that in Man, excepting that the Ventricles are a little larger. In an Ourang-outang^ the Ventricles of the Larynx are very large, and each divided into two by a semi- partition ; above which is a Foramen, leading to a large Sac^ discovered by Dr Camper* These Sacs are unit-

^10 OF THE MUSCLES [Pakt 11. the lateral angle of the Sternum and base of the Clavi- cle, and brings the Humerus close to the Body, in which motion it is assisted by two small Muscles, passing be- tween the Clavicle and Head of the Humerus. By the action of these three Muscles, the alternate motions of raising and depressing the Wing are produced, by which the Bird is carried forward in flying. By the strength of the Tail the Animal is kept in a proper balance, and prevented from falling forward. The Latissimus Dorsi is formed of two portions, one fixed under the Head, and the other at the middle of the Body of the Humerus. The other Muscles of the Scapula are nearly as in a Human Body. The Biceps has one origin from the Scapula, and another from the Os Humeri, and is inserted into the Ulna. The Bracheus arises from the Linea Aspera, and is fixed to the inner side of the Head of the Ulna. There is another Flexor which arises from the Exter- nal Condyle of the Humerus, and, after extending some way along the upper portion of the Ulna, is fixed to the outer part of that Bone, The Extensor Cubiti is com- posed of two portions, one from the Scapula, the other from the Humerus. There is also an Anconeus. The Supinator Longus is wanting. There is a kind of Supi- nator Brevis, but it is considered as bending the Fore- arm. Two Muscles occupy the place of the Pronator Teres, though seemingly acting as Flexors. The Metacarpus possesses only the motions of adduc- tion and abduction. The Muscles for performing these motions are the following: The Ulnaris Internus, which arises as in Man, and is fixed to the wedge-like Bone of the Carpus ; another Muscle lying under this, and sending off a long Tendon, which gives slips to the se-

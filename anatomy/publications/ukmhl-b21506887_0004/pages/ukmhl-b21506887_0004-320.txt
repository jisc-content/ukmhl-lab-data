316 OF THE EYE [Paet IV. the rays of light coming from the water. It is re- markably large in most Fishes, but the Vitreous Hu- mour is proportionally small. The Optic Nerves, in Osseous Fishes^ cross each other without any intermixture of Medullary Substance, and go to the opposite Eyes. The crossing is less appa- rent in the Cartilaginous kind. In a S'kate, the Right Nerve passes through an opening in the Left. In ge- neral, the body of the Nerve is Fibrous, as in other A- niraals; but in some, as a Sword-fish^ it is formed of Layers put together like a Fan, and inclosed in the Dura Mater. In many Fishes, as a Raja and Squalus, the Nerve, getting into the Eye, forms, as in Reptiles, a small Tubercle, from the edges of which the Retina grows; but in others, as a Salmon, Herring, &c. the nerve, after perforating the Choroid coat, forms two white . lines, which give origin to the Retina, somewhat in the manner the single line gives origin to it in Birds. The Retina has a peculiar appearance in Fishes, be- ing formed of two Layers, the external of which is Me- dullary, and the internal Fibrous. The Muscles, in this class of Animals, as in the for- mer, are six in number, four strait, and two oblique; â€¢ but both of the latter come from the anterior and under side of the Orbit. One is inserted at the under, the other at the upper part of the Eye, without the inter- vention of a pulley, as in Mammalia.

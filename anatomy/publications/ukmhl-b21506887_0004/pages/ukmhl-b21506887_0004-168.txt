1645 OF THE INTESTINES. [Part I. Animals, of course in the different Animals of this class, and are nearly of the same nature as in a Hu- man Body, the Mesentery being longer or shorter, and running in a straight, or an oblique, or in a circular direction, according to the length and course of the Intestines. In many Quadrupeds, it is longer than in Man, partly owing to the depth and length of the Ab- domen. Of the Anus and its Muscles.â€”In Mammalia and Birds, the Anus is placed at the posterior extremity of the Trunk of the Body, directly under the origin of the Tail, and generally in a direction opposite to the Mouth. In almost all Mammalia, it is a simple ori- fice, which only gives passage to the Faeces. In a Sloth and Beaver, the Rectum and Urethra have a com- mon termination. In an Ornithorrynchus, the end of the Rectum is remarkable, for dilating into a Bag, which receives the Faeces, Urine, and the Sexual eva- cuations. The following numbers represent nearly the propor- tional length of the Intestinal Canal to that of the Body, in a few of the Mammiferous Animals mentioned in this work, the measurement being iji a straight line from the Nose to the Anus. Taking the length of the Body as 1, that of the Intestines is as followsIn the Ape tribe, varying from 6 to 8; in a Sloth^ 3 to 1 ; Ant-eater, 3 ; Armadillo, 3 ; Ornithorrynchus, 5; Bat, 3; Squirrel, 12; Rat, 8; Guinea-Pig, 16; Wild Rab- bit, 11; Tame Rabbit, 9 ; Beaver, 9 ; Hedge-hog., 6 ; Mole, 8 ; Brow7i Bear, 8 ; White Bear, 10 ; Opossums, from 2 to 3 ; Kanguroo Rat, 5 ; Kanguroo Giant, 10 ;

In Opossums, the Glans is divided into two parts, each of which is perforated for the transmission of the Semen. At the division of the Glans, is the passage for the Urine. In an Echidna and an Ornithorrynchus ParadowuSy the Urethra, destitute of Cavernous Substance, is in- closed along with the Rectum, by a Constrictor Muscle, which terminates in the Cloaca, that receives the Se- men and Urine.

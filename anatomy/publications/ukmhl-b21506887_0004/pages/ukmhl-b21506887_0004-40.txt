36 OF THE BONES. [Part I. The Cetacea and Seal have no cavities even in their long Bones. The Horns of some Animals, as a Stag, are of the same nature with the Bones, but internally have nei- ther Cavities nor Marrow. The component parts of the Bones of all Mammalia correspond in a great measure with those of a Human Body ; but their relative proportions are found to dif- fer, not only in the various Genera and Species, but in the different Bones of the same individual. The Horn of a Stag is similar to Bone, not only in its texture, but also in its component parts, in which, how- ever, there is a large proportion of Gelatin; OF THE SKELETON. The Skeleton of Mammalia is divided into Head, Trunk, and Extremities; the last of which, in Qua- drupeds, owing to the horizontal situation of the Ani- mal, are denominated Anterior and Posterior, the for- mer corresponding to the Superior, the latter to the Inferior Extremities of a Human Body.

Part V.] OF MOLLUSCA. 853 VOL IV. z The Liver, in the different Mollusca, is commonly large in proportion ; it has no Vena Portae ; it receives its Blood from the Aorta, and returns it by Veins to the Cava. In Cephalopoda, the Liver is a brown mass, situated near the Head, and extending into the Abdo- men. In a Sepia Loligo, the Bag which produces the ink is situated on the Liver, and sends out a Duct, which terminates near the end of the Rectum. In a Sepia Officinalis, the Ink-bag is situated between the Lobes of the Liver, and in a Sepia Octopus, at a dis- tance from them. In these Animals, according to CuviER, the Liver sends Bile of an orange colour, by two Ducts, into the Gizzard. The contents of the Ink-bag are supposed to be discharged by the action of the large Muscular Sheath of the Body of the Animal, and serve to render the surrounding element bitter, when the Creature is in danger of being attacked by an enemy. According to the Author mentioned above, the Indian Ink from China is manufactured from this fluid. Gasteropoda have a large Liver, di- vided into Lobes, which send out a number of Ducts that surround the Alimentary Canal, and terminate in the Intestines. In a Slug, the transparent Blood-vessels form a border, which is conspicuous on the dark-co- loured Liver. In many of the Snail kind, the Liver, with the Organs of Generation, occupies the upper turns of the Shell. In Acephalous Mollusca, particularly among Bivalves, as a Muscle and Oyster, the Liver surrounds the Stomach, and discharges the Bile into it by many openings. Organs of Generation.-^l^here are here four different combinations found; 1. Separate Sexes with copulation,

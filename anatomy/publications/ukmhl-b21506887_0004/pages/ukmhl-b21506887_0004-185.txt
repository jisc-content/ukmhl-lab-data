Part I.] OF MAMMALIA. 181 time. They are observed also to be filled, apparently with the same kind of liquor. They exist in most of the GUres, as a Maty and in a Hedge-hog and JMoIe among Carnivora, but appear to be wanting in the other Mammalia, a Horse excepted, in which there is a cylindrical Vesicle placed between the Vasa Ceferentia, and terminating in the Urethra, before the openings of the Vesiculae Seminales and Vasa Deferentia. Prostate Gland.—The Prostate Gland, or something analogous to it, appears to exist in all Mammalia, but varies exceedingly in its appearance in the different Species. In some, as the Dog and Cat tribe, it is single, in others, as Ruminants, it is double. In a small number, as a Horse and Elephant, it is quadruple; and in a Bat, it is lobulated. In most of the Animals of the class, the structure is as in Man. In others, as a Horse, Ruminants, and an Elephant, it has Cavities within. In Cetacea, it is Cellular, and of great proportional size. It generally surrounds the beginning of the Urethra, and termi- nates in that Canal, by one or more openings, at the side ©f the Verumontanum, though sometimes consi- derably farther forwards. In a Horse and Elephant, the Prostates are covered by Muscular Fibres, which proceed from the sides of the Bladder. In most of the Glires, and in a Hedge-hog bmA Mole, among Ferae, the place of the Prostate is supplied by the Vesiculae Accessorise.

OF THE EYE. 94 [Fart I. lids, and communicate by a Groove with the inner an- gle of the Eye. In an ElephanU the Lacrymal Organs have not been found ; and in Cetacea^ as in most Animals living con- stantly in water, they are wanting. The Tunica Conjunctiva agrees, in general, with that in Man, varying only a little in colour over the Tunica Sclerotica. The Cornea, in Quadrupeds, is not quite circular, being somewhat wider in a transverse than in a longi- tudinal direction. It varies a little in convexity in different Animals, and also in its proportion with re- spect to the Sclerotica. In all it is composed, as in Man, of transparent thin Membranes, closely united. The Iris exhibits great variety in colour in different Animals. Each Species, in the wild state, is observed to have a fixed colour : but this varies in domestic Ani- mals, though less than in the Human Species. These variations are found to correspond, in some measure, with the colour of the Hair; and in party-coloured Animals, a mixture of colours has been observed in the Iris. A Fibrous structure appears in the Iris of some Animals, as an Ox, which has been considered by late writers as Muscular, and affecting the Pupil. Blum- ENBACH has not been able to discover true Muscular Fibres in the Iris even of an Elephant and Whale, The motions of the Iris in the whole Animals of this class are involuntary. The form and size of the Pupil correspond with the Animal's manner of life. In the Ape kind, and mapy Carnimra, it is round as in Man. In SoUpeds, Ruminants, and Cetacea, it is transversely oblong. In the Cat kind, it forms an oval, placed in a

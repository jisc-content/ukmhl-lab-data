^66 OF THE MUSCLES [Part III. Tortoise, where the Muscles are Aponeurotic Bands, which strengthen the Articulations. Muscles of the Posterior Eoctremity,â€”There is a Mus- cle, analogous to the Quadratus Lumborum, lying un- der the Dorsal Shell, and moving the Os Ilium ; and another, supplying the place of a Rectus Abdominis, arising from the posterior extremity of the Abdominal Shell, and fixed to the Pubes. Of the Muscles of the Thigh, there are different Adductors. A Muscle from the Pubes is fixed to the small Trochanter, and holds the place of the Iliacus and Psoas. Qne Muscle arises from the Spine, and two from the Pubes, which corre- spond to the Glutei. A Muscle analogous to the Ob- turator Internus arises from the Ilium, and is fixed to the great Trochanter. The Muscles of the Leg are analogous to the Semi-membranosus, Semi-tendinosus, and Sartorius. There is an Extensor, a Rectus, and two Bicipites. One remarkably thin Muscle arises from the Coccyx, and passes under the Skin of the Extre- mity to its insertion, nearly opposite the Heel. It bends the Leg, and extends the Foot. In a Sea Tor^ toise, the Muscles of the Foot, and also of the Toes, are chiefly Aponeurotic. In a Frog^ few Muscles belong to the Spine. A Muscle analogous to the Coccygeus draws the Coccyx into the same direction with the Spine. There is a sort of Sacro-lumbalis, which is fixed to the Transverse Processes of the Vertebrae, and extends as far as the Head ; an Obliquus Superior, a Rectus Anterior, and Jntertransversales. The Abdominal Muscles, on account of want of nibs, are inserted into the Sternum. There are few

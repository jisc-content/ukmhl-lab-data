16^ OF THE INTESTINES. [Part I. The Colon, furnished with a circular Valve, is small and short, as in other Carnivora, and, without making any circuitous turn, goes directly across the Abdomen to form the Rectum. A Cat has the great Intestines considerably dilated, but the Caecum is remarkably short. Of the Amphibious Mammalia, a Seal has the Colon about double the size of the small Intestines, and the Caecum is short and rounded. In a Manatus, or Sea Cow, the Intestines are scarcely six times the length of the Body, though the Animal is of the Her- bivorous kind. SoUpeds have a much shorter Canal than the other Herbivora, but the great Intestines are enormously dilated. The Colon begins by a Cul-de-Sac, and its Cavity is divided into Cells by three strong Muscular Bands. The Caecum is of a conical form, and so large as to equal the size of the Stomach. Pecora, of all other Quadrupeds, have in general the Canal of greatest length, and a Earn has the longest of any. A great part of the Intestines, in this order, form concentric turns, and there is little diiFerence with re- spect to their size. The Duodenum is large, and forms a kind of Pouch ; but the Colon and Caecum are of moderate bulk. They are uniform on their surface, and have no Ligaments tacking them up into Cells. Of the order Belluce,â€”In a Hog, the small Intes- tines are united, and have conspicuous Papillae. The Caecum and Colon are of considerable size. In an Elephant, the Canal is short, but very large. The small Intestines have many large Valvulae Conniventes.

140 OF THE ABSORBENTS. [Part I. The course and termination of the Thoracic Duct varies a little in different Animals. In some, as a Dog^ it forms two distinct Canals; in others, as a Sea- otter^ three or four Trunks are found. It forms, more constantly than in Man, a Vesicular enlargement, or Receptaculum Chyli. It makes no circuitous turn previously to its termi- nation, the horizontal situation of Quadrupeds allowing a readier course to its contents. There are also fewer Valves here than in Animals moving in the upright position. In a Horse, only a single pair is observed; while in an Ape, as in a Human Body, there are several Valves, to favour the passage of the Lymph and Chyle, or at least prevent their reflux.

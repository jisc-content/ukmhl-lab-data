These afterwards expand in the substance of the Yolk, and, by degrees, carry it into the Veins of the Yolk-bag for the nourishment of the Chick. Four- teenth, the Feathers are discerned. Nineteenth, the Animal has the power of using its Vocal Organs, and, some time before itsexclusion, may frequently be heard making the same kind of sound that Chickens make after they are hatched; and this in consequence of breaking with the Beak, the Air-bag placed at the great end of the Shell. , Twenty-first, it makes its ap- pearance, sometimes by bursting the Shell irregularly, at other times perforating the larger end with its Beak. W^hile the Chick lies in the Shell, it is coiled up, with its Neck bent forwards, the Head covered by the Wing, and the Yolk between its Legs. Directly after leaving the Shell, the remains of the Yolk and its Bag are observed in the Abdomen ; the former is taken into the Intestines, and serves for nourishment till the Ani- mal acquires strength enough for another kind of Food.

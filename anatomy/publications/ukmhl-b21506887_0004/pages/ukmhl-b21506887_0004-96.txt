They are largest in proportion in small Animals, excepting in such as live much under ground, as a Mole and Shrew, in which they are quite diminutive. In the Ape kind, their direction is forwardas in Man, but they are closer together. In other Quadrupeds, they are placed laterally, and proportionally more dis- tant from each other. In Man, and in the Ape tribe, the axis and trans- verse diameter are nearly equal to each other. In the greater number of Quadrupeds, the axis is rather less than the transverse diameter. In Cetacea, it is found to be nearly as two to three. Eye-lids are common to all the Animals of the class, but the under one, in most Quadrupeds, wants Cilia. In most of the Ape tribe, in an Elephant, &c. they are present in both Eye-lids. The Sebaceous Follicles are very distinct in the larger Mammalia, as an O^, &c. The greater number of Quadrupeds have a third Eye- lid, termed Membrana Nictitans, or Palpehra Tertm vel Interna. It is of a thick substance, and crescentic

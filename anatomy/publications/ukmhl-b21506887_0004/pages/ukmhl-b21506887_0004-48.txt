OF THE BONES. 44 [Part I. Elephant, Ox^ and Camel, in which they are remark- ably long. The Lumbar Vertebrae vary much in number in the different species of this class, as will be seen in the Table annexed. The Spinous and Transverse Pro- cesses are directed forwards in the same angles; for example, in a Dog and Cat The size of the Trans- verse Processes is considerable in some, as an Ox and Horse, to give attachment to the strong Muscles of the Loins. The Os Sacrum varies more in appearance than any of the former sets of Vertebrae ; the number not being the same, even in the different species of the same Ge- nus. It is generally narrower in proportion than in Man, but wider in such Genera as occasionally stand erect, as an Ape, Bear, &c. The Spinous Processes are longer in most of the Ferce than in Man. In most Ruminants, they almost form a continued crest. In the greater part of the Ape tribe, it has one or two pieces fewer than in a Human Body. In a long-tailed Ape, indeed, there are six ; but in an Ow- rang-outang there are only three. In a Horse, it is remarkable for the long Lateral Processes at its anterior extremity. The Cetacea want the Pelvis, of course the Sacrum. The Os Coccygis is extended to form the Tail, which, in many Quadrupeds, consists of a great num- ber of pieces ; and these are of two kinds, one which has a Spinal Canal, and another in which there is no perforation. In such Apes as want Tails, this Bone is found to have at most three pieces; but these are per-

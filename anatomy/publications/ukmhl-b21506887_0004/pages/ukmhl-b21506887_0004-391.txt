Part IX.] OF ZOOPHYTES. Ml there are Tentacula with open orifices, leading to Ca- nals, that, uniting together, form Trunks which con- vey the Food into the Stomach. The structure has been compared by Cuvier to the roots o:f trees, in consequence of which he forms a new Genus, termed Bhizostoma, or Mouth-root. The common Polypus has the most simple form of the Alimentary Canal, the whole Body being only a kind of Stomach, and having a single opening situated at the centre of the Tentacula, the Animal nourishing its spongy substance by imbibition. Polypi, which, by their union, form the Compound Animals that produce the different Lythophytes, are observed to have a nutritive system something similar to a common Polypus and a Medusa. They combine the Stomachs of the former with the Vessels of the latter. Each Polypus has a Stomach, from which Tubes run in- to the Stalk that supports all the Polypi; here they form a net-work, which occupies the whole of this substance. The Assistant Chylopoietic Viscera, vi^. Liver, Spleen, and Pancreas, are entirely wanting in this class. Organs of Generation.â€”All Echinodermafa appear to be Hermaphrodite, and possess the power of Fecun- dating themselves. Their Ovaria occupy a great part of their Body, especially when pregnant. Sometimes they are observed to be bathed in a milky liquory which is supposed to be Semen. An Echinus has five lobes in the Ovarium or Roe. These open by several Ducts, which communicate, and pierce the Shell near the Anus. The Ovaria form the eatable part of this Animal. In an Asterias^ the Ovaria form also five Lobes;, one

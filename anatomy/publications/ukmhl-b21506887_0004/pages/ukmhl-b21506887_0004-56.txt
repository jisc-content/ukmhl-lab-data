52 [Part L OF THE BONES. dix of the Radius. In the latter it is anchylosed with the Radius almost its whole length. In SoUpeds, there is a Furrow, with a slit on the top. Hooved Animals have the Inferior Head of the Radius compressed, and the back of the Carpus turned forward. In Ceta^ cea, the Radius and Ulna have a flattened form. Hand.—^The Carpus in Apes has one Bone more than in man. The Os Pisiforme is so prominent as to serve as a sort of Fleel; and the same thing happens in Carnivora. In " a Mole, besides nine Bones, as in a Monkey, there is a Falciform Bone, which gives the shovel-like form to the Hand. In Carnivora, the Scaphoid and Lunar Bones are joined into one piece. Ruminants have four Bones in the first range. Most have two in the second. SoU- peds have four in the first range, and three in the se- cond. In Cetacea, the Bones of the Carpus are flatten- ed, and joined together in form of a pavement. Metacarpus.—The number of the Bones here is in general equal to that of the Fore Toes, except in SoU- peds and Ruminants, where, in the former, the Meta- carpal Bone consisted originally of two pieces, and, in the latter, the tY/o Metacarpal Bones are at an early age united into one piece. In both these orders, this single piece is termed Canon or Shank Bone, In a Horse, the Canon Bone has a pair of much shorter pieces, called Styloid or Splint Bones, firmly attached to its posterior and lateral parts ; these have been considered also as Metacarpal Bones. In a Pig, the Metacarpus consists of four distinct Bones. In a Dog, Horse, Ox, Sheep, &c. where only the

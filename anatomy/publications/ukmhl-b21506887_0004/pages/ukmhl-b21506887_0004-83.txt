Part I.] OF MAMMALIA. 79 side of the Bone, produces the Horn in successive Layers, sent off upon the internal surface. As the Animal advances in life, Furrows extend across the root of the Horn, from which, by experience, the age of the Animal can nearly be known. The Horn of a Rhinoceros only differs from that of Ruminants^ in being situated over the bones of the Nose, in appear- ing to take its origin from the Skin, and in having no Osseous matter within. The colour of the Horns, as of the Hair, depends upon that of the Corpus Mucosum. In their consist- ence, they are solid, insensible, and of a Fibrous tex- ture ; the Fibres bearing a considerable analogy to the Hairs, as may be more distinctly seen in the Horn of a Rhinoceros. They are more or less transparent according to their thinness. When artificially soften- ed by hot water, &c. they may be bent in any direc- tion, and moulded into any form. The Antler of a Stag differs from Horn, in grow- ing from its extremity, and not from its base ; in being covered, at a certain period, with Hairs; and in being deciduous. It is a real Process of Bone, appearing, when fully grown, a continuation of the Os Frontis, and is covered, during the time of its growth, with a Periosteum and hairy Skin, which is very Vascular; the Vessels passing through an Osseous circle at the root of the Antler. The growth is commonly finished before the end of the third month. When it is completely formed, it loses its covering of Skin and Periosteum, in consequence of the Vessels at its root being obstructed, and remains afterwards quite

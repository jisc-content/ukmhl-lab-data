Paut I.] OF MAMMALIA. 77 or a greasy matter is discharged from visible Follicles on certain parts, as in the Axillae and Knees of the Animal just mentioned. Glandular Follicles are in some collected into masses, and appear in certain parts of the Body, as in the Groins. The secretions from the Skin, in some of the Mam- malia, hBNe peculiar smells, by which one Animal can follow the track of another, or a Dog even trace the footsteps of his master. Under the Common Integuments is the Panniculus Carnosus, which has already been taken notice of in the description of the Muscles. All Quadrupeds have Hairs more or less numerous, or something of a similar nature, to protect them from the effects of the weather, or from external injury, or to serve as ornament. They are commonly in greater abundance on the upper, than the under parts of the Body, and, as in Man, they are implanted in the true Skin, and sometimes go as deep as the Panniculus Car- nosus. The form of the Hair is commonly cylindrical, as in a Horse, but sometimes is flat, as in the Toes of an OrnitJiorryncJius and common Porcupine, Whiskers of a Seal, and Tail of a Hippopotamus ; or they are curl- ed and waving, as in many Ruminants. The texture is affected by climate and manner of life. They are long and stiff in northern regions, as in the Hog of Siberia, and Sheep of Iceland ; fine and silky in southern parts, as in the Dog of Malta, Cat, Rabbit, and Goat of Angola ; thin, or almost wanting, as in the Dog of Guinea, and Sheep of Africa.

260 OF THE BONES [Part III. In all other Reptiles, there is nearly the same kind of articulation as in a Turtle, There are no Teeth in the Turtle kind, in place of which their Jaws are co- vered with a Horny substance, similar in structure and connexion to the Hoof on the Foot of a Horse; and so strong, as to be capable of breaking substances of great hardness. The Os Hyoides varies much in this and the other orders of the class, though in general it approaches, in its appearance, to that of Birds. Seven Vertehrce enter into the composition of the Neck. The Trunk is formed of two great portions, the Dorsal and Abdominal Shells. The Dorsal, Lum- bar, and Sacral Vertebrae, are all united into one piece, but the Vertebrae of the Tail are free and moveable. The Dorsal Shell consists of a great number of Os seous Plates, regular in their position, and approach- ing to a quadrangular form. They are connected to each other by Suture, and joined to the Abdominal Shell by a thick and very tough Skin. The Abdominal Shell, like the Dorsal, is also com- posed of many plates joined together by Suture, and forming a kind of Sternum, which covers almost the whole inferior part of the Body of the Animal. The Os Innominatum possesses the same number of pieces with that in Mammalia; but the Os Pubis is the largest, and the Os Ilium the smallest of the three. The Ribs are eight in number, but are all anchylosed with the Vertebrae of the Back and the Dorsal Shell. They terminate in a border which surrounds the Shell, and are united to it by Suture. The Scapula has a singular situation before the Shell

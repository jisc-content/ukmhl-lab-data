146 OF THE LARYNX, &c. [Part I. In Cetacea, Mr Hunter did not find the Thyroid Gland. Cuvier, however, detected it in a Dolphiriy where it was divided into two portions, which were at a distance from the Larynx, and near the anterior ex- tremity of the Sternum. Tracheaâ€”This presents, in general, the same struc- ture as in a Human Body; but the number of the Bronchi varies with that of the Lobes of the Lungs. There is great variety in the number, form, and ex- tent of the Cartilaginous Rings of the Trachea. They approach nearer to a circle in Quadrupeds than in Man; the opening behind, therefore, is proportionally smaller. Many of the Glires have rings almost complete. In some of the Feroe^ as a Bear, Lion, &c. they form about three-fourths of a circle. Among other Animals, as an Ox, the extremities of the Cartilages meet behind in an acute angle. In a few, as a Lama, Seal, Lamantin^ Dolphin, and Porpoise, the Cartilages of the Trachea, and of the beginning of the Bronchi, are observed to form a com- plete circle.

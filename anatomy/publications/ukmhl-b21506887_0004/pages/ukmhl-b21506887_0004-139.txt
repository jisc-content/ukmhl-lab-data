Part I.] OF MAMMALIA. 134 tribution of its Branches, corresponding with the di- vision and extent of the Intestines, and the magnitude of the other Abdominal Viscera. Of the peculiarities of the Arteiries here, the most remarkable is that of the Rete Mirabile, found in the greater number of Quadrupeds, particularly among Carnivorous Animals and Ruminants. It is situated at the sides of the Sella Turcica, and consists of a di- vision of the Internal Carotids within the Head into serpentine Branches, which afterwards unite, and form a Trunk that divides again nearly as in a Human Body. An uncommon division of the Arteries, also, has lately been observed in some Animals, as a Sloth and Lemur, where the Trunk separates at the top of the Os Humeri and Os Femoris into Branches, which, after descending nearly as far as the Elbow and Knee, re- unite, and are then distributed in the usual way. In some Animals, as Cetacea, a considerable Plexus of convolutions is formed in Arteries of particular parts of the Body, as the Intercostals, Branches from the Subclavians to the Chest, and Branches to the Spinal Marrow and Eye. In many Animals, the common Iliacs are wanting,^ and there the Aorta divides into two Branches, which supply the place of External Iliacs, while a common- Trunk, from the extremity of the Aorta, sends off the Sacra Media and Arteries analogous to the Inter- nal Iliacs. The Sacra Media, in Quadrupeds, is generally of considerable size, on account of the length of the Tail.

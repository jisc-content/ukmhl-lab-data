m OF THE FEMALE ORGANS [Part III. Many of this class, as a Rattlesnake and Viper, are Viviparous, the Ova being hatched in the Cavity of the Oviduct. Rattlesnakes are known to couple in August, when they are frequently observed to make a noise with their Rattle, a substance peculiar to this Animal, and consisting of a number of flat, hollow, and horny substances, each linked into the one suc- ceeding it, the first covering the last Vertebra of the Tail. The Rattlesnake produces about a dozen of young, commonly in the month of June. In some of these Animals, living Snakes have been taken from the Belly, several inches in length. In Frogs, the Ova are clustered up, and extremely numerous. They are found to float loose in the Cavity of the Abdomen, previously to their getting into the Oviducts or Uterine Tubes. The Oviducts, in these Animals, are extremely long and convoluted, appear- ing like so many Intestines. Each begins at the side of the Heart by an open orifice, and terminates by a large dilatation or Uterus, which ends in a Cloaca. In a Surinam Toad, (the Rana Pipa), there is a structure somewhat similar to the False Belly of Mar- supial Animals. Numerous Cells are formed in the Integuments of the back of the Female. These con- tain the Ova, which go through their different changes till the Animals are completely formed, which after- wards make their exit by correspondent openings in the Skin. The Cells are not observed till the time arrives, when they are to receive the Ova.

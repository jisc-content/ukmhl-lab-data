Part IV.] OF FISHES. 311 Brain. The Cervical Nerves are few in number, and in some Animals there are none, the Vertebrae of the Neck, in such Fishes, being wanting. When present, they are chiefly dispersed about the Throat and Pecto- ral Fin. There is no Diaphragmatic Nerve, though one of the first Vertebral Nerves is spent upon the par- tition between the Cavity of the Branchiae and that of the Abdomen. The Dorsal and Lumbar Nerves are all distributed in the Intercostal spaces. The Sacral and Caudal Nerves are not very distinct; they are lost in the posterior part of the Body and the Tail Fin. Besides the / Nerves mentioned above, it is here thought proper to take notice of those which belong, in certain Electrical Fishes, to that curious apparatus which performs the office of a Leyden Jar, or Electrical Battery. A Raja Torpedo, Gymnotus Electi^icus, and Silurus Electricus, are the only Fishes in which Elec- trical Organs have been discovered; though one Species of the Tetraofton, and one of the TricMurus, possess the same electric property. In the three first-named Animals, the Electric Organ consists of Aponeurotic Cells, filled with a fluid like the Glaire of an Egg. Upon this substance large Nerves are distributed ; but the proportional size and the structure of the Cells, the origin, number, and relative magnitude of the Nerves, vary in the three diff*erent Species. The Electrical Organ of a Torpedo bears a large proportion to the Body of the Animal, and is situated between the Head, the Branchiae, and great Cartilage of the Pectoral Fin in each side; or in that part from whence the Mucous Ducts issue as from a centre, on the Back of a Skate. It extends in a perpendicular

In the Rat tribe, which are Omnivorous, the Canal is shorter than in the other Glires; but the Caecum surpasses the size of the Stomach, though it varies much in the different kinds. The Appendix Vermi- formis, as already noticed, is found only in a Phas^ colome. In a Hare and Rabbit, the Caecum is longer than the whole Animal, and is furnished internally with a peculiar Spiral Valve. The Colon is also dilated. In a Beaver, the Rectum and Urethra have a com- mon termination. Of Perce, a Hedge-hog has neither a proper Colon nor a Caecum. A Badger, which is not strictly a Carnivorous Animal, and a Glis Esculentus, or RelU mouse, have no distinction between small and great Intestines. A Hedge-hog, Bear, and some other Animals of this kind, that walk upon the soles of their feet, and are Omnivorous, have a long but nar- row Canal, and no Caecum, nor distinction of large Intestines. In an Opossum, there is a long Colon, and a large Caecum. Kanguroos have no Cells in the Canal, but have a large Caecum. In a I>og, the Duodenum is fixed at the Pylorus to the Liver, but afterwards a large portion hangs loose in the Abdomen. The Inner Side of the Intestine has Valvulae Conniventes, but placed in a longitudinal di- rection. The Caecum makes turns upon the Ilium. VOL IV. L V

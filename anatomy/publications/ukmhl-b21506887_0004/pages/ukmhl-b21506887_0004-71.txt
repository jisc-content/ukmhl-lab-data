Part I.] OF MAMMALIA. 67 portion of it is ossified, being employed in throwing up the earth. The small Muscles of the Head exist in Quadrupeds as well as in Man. In general, the Complexus has one continued Fleshy Belly, though, in Ferae^ there are Tendinous Intersections through its whole length. The Splenius is inserted into the Ligamentum Nuchae in such Animals as have this Ligament considerably raised above the Vertebrae. MUSCLES OF THE ANTERIOR EXTRE- MITIES. Muscles of the Shoulder.â€”The Serratus Magnus, Pectoralis Minor, and Subclavius, have been already taken notice of. In an Ape, the Trapezius resembles that in Man; but in other Quadrupeds, it is complicated with the Sterno-mastoid and Deltoid Muscles, and in some with the Levator Scapulae, which has great variety, in the number and insertion of its Tendon, in different Qua- drupeds. In a Rabbit, a peculiar Muscle arises from the fore part of the Spine of the Scapula, and is inserted into the Clavicle. The Rhomboid in Aj)es is extended as far as the Occiput. The Occipital portion of n Carnivora, forms a Muscle termed Levator Scapuloe Magnus. The Omo-hyoideus is wanting in Animals which have no Clavicle nor Coracoid Process, as in Dogs. The Subclavius is present in Animals with, but absent in these without Clavicles. E 2

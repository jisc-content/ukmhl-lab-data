paetiii ] of reptiles. m Tubes united at their basis, and discharging a secreted liquor from their other extremities. The Amphibia of Cuvier, viz. a Seal and Walrus, have the same apparatus, but not in the sarpe situation, being directly under the Tongue. Besides these Glands, some Serpents^ viz. all with Tusks or Fangs in their Upper Jaw, have others which correspond with the Salivary Glands of Mam- malia. They are placed behind each Orbit, and have two Muscles, which, by raising the Tusks, compress the Glands, and push the venom through Canals in the Fangs, which terminate by an oblique opening at their point, and serve as Excretory Tubes to the Glands.

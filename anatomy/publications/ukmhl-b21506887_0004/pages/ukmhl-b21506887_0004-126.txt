m OF THE MOUTH, &c. [Part L harder than the body of the Tusk, but softer than Enamel. The Osseous substance composing these Tusks, which, in the class Belluce in general, and some of the Whale tribe, forms Ivory, diiFers from that of other Teeth, in being of a harder and denser texture. The Ivory of an Elephant's Tusk is distin- guished from that of all others by the Curvilinear Lo- zenges which appear very distinctly in the polished trans- verse section of a Tusk. The Ivory of this Animal is softer than that of others, and acquires a yellow hue by exposure to the air. That of a Hippopotamus is harder and whiter than the former, and preferred by Dentists in the making of artificial Teeth. The most remarkable Teeth are those of a Cape A71U eater, which are formed of cylinders composed of small Tubes, shut at the triturating surfaces, and, when cut transversely, appearing like the section of a Cane. The Teeth of an Ormthorrynchus are observed to have a similar structure. The Bodies of the Teeth, in some Animals, have a particular colour externally, as in a Squirrel, Beaver^ &c. where they are brown anteriorly; and in several Pecora, where the Molares are covered by a hard blackish substance of a glassy appearance. In an Ox and Sheep, it is of a bronze colour. The Front Teeth of the Upper Jaw are fixed in the Intermaxillary Bone, which includes also the Tusks of an Elephant, Walrus, and Narwal. The number and form of the Teeth vary considera- bly in different Mammalia. In Glires, the cutting edges of the Incisores are in the form of a Chisel. The Teeth of some Animals, as Glires, are covered

Past I.] OF MAMMALIA. I1f tween the different Bundles of the Seminal Tubes of tJjie Testicle, to protect and bind these together. The form and relative size of the Epididymis varies much in different Animals. In most Mammalia, it is fixed to the Testicle, as in Man; but in many of the Glires, as a Rat, and in Animals with a Pouch, it is connected to the Testicle only by two thin Cords. The Vasa Deferentia^ as in Man, are thick and firm, but thinner when the Testes lie constantly in the Ab- domen. As in the Human Species, also, the Vasa De- ferentia, in many Animals, are enlarged, and are Cel- lular internally, for some space previously to their ter- mination. The Cells, in a Horse, and also in a Ram, have small orifices internally, from which a thick white fluid can be pressed into them. In an Elephant, the dilatation is of a Globular form. Most Mammalia possess Vesicular Seminales, which in many, as in some Apes, but particularly in a Hedge- hog, are greatly enlarged, like the Testicle, when these Animals are in season. The Vesiculae exist in Apes, in Bats, in Glires, in a Hedge-hog and Racoon, in Soli- peds, and in Belluce. They are wanting in an OrnithorrynchuSy in Garni- vora, in Ruminants, unless two small Glandular Cap- sules, considered by some as Prostate Glands, be taken for such, and in Cetacea. There is no rule yet known with respect to the presence or the absence of these. Their form and structure vary exceedingly in diffe- rent Mammalia. They are commonly Membjranous and Cellular, but in many cases they have a Glandular M S

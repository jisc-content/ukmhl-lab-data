805 Part IV.] OF FISHES. OF THE INTEGUMENTS, The Integuments here have the same number of Layers as in the former class of Animals. The Cuti^ cle is strong and thick, and is covered by the Scales^ which are laid on each other like tiles on a house, and exist less or more in Fishes in general. The Scales are found to cover the Cuticle, as the Hair, &c. does in other Animals, but are not, like these substances, frequently changed ; instead of which, they are found to be permanent, and are said to increase in number as the Animal becomes older. The Cutis is very thick and strong in a Sturgeon^ and in some of the S'kate and SharJc kind; but in Fishes with large Scales, as a Cyprinus and Sparus, it is of a thin and delicate texture. In certain Vertebral Fishes, as a Carp, there are some Muscular Fibres attached to the Skin of the Back, forming a kind of Panniculus Carnosus. In Fishes, as well as in other cold-blooded Animals, there is no Fat under the Skin. In some, as a Sal- mon and Trout, there is an oily fluid; in others, as a Moon-fisJi, a substance of great thickness, like Lard, under the Skin, but it is found to be of the nature of Albumen. The Integuments of Fishes have no vessels carrying red Blood, and but very small Nerves ; of course, are well fitted for protecting the tender parts within. VOL. IV. u

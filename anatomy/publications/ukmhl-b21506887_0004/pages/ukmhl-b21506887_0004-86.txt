OF THE INTEGUMENTS. [Part L 82 the parts near them. In the Prepuce of a Beaver are similar Glands, which furnish the Castor. They form a mass, that has a bag near it which contains this substance, and opens at each side of the chink common to the Anus and Penis. In a Male Musk Goat, (Moschus Moscifer), are parts similar, and similarly situated, to those of the Castor. They are of an oval form, and are full of Follicles, which separate t?ie Musk. In a Hare, and the greater part of Ruminants, are Glands under the Skin of the Groin, and therefore termed Inguinal, which secrete a Sebaceous Fetid sub- stance, and send it into Cavities from which it is dis- charged by an orifice at each side of the Prepuce. In many of the Glires, but especially in Land and Amphibious Carnivora, as a Badger, Civet, Pole-Cat, Dog, Fooc, Lion, he. peculiar Glands and Bags are found near the outer end of the Rectum, and therefore called Anal. They are commonly of a spherical shape, and have a single orifice frequently ending at the side of the Anus. They secrete a matter of various colours, but commonly yellow or brown, of a strong disagree- able smell. In a Badger, Pole-cat, and Fox, the smell is remarkably strong; and some of the Weasel tribe in America, as a SJiunk and Squash, are observed, upon being pursued, to pour out the contents of these Bags so profusely, that their followers cannot approach them. The matter secreted in these Bags may be excremen- titious in some Animals ; but in others, it appears to lubricate the Skin, and defend it from beingL injured by the Fasces.

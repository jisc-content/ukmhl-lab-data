Part I.] OF MAMMALIA. 195 contents of the Utei'us have come away, but exist in the Uterus both in the gravid and unimpregnated state. The number and form of these excrescences vary in different Animals. In a Sheep and Coiv, they are from seventy to a hundred. In some Animals, they are concave externally ; in others, convex. The Involucra of a Foetus consist of the outer Membrane, or Chorion^ and the inner one, or Amnios^ that secretes the liquor in which the Animal swims. The two Membranes, contrary to what happens in the Human Species, are covered with Blood-vessels derived from those of the Umbilical Cord.. Between the Chorion and Amnios, in most pregnant Mammalia, Cetacea not excepted, there is an Al- lantois, or Bag, but destitute of Blood-vessels, which receives the Urine from the Bladder by a Canal termed Urachus. In SoUpeds, the AUantois is every where interposed between the other two Membranes. In a Cow and Sheep, it covers only a part of the Amnios; and in a Sow, it covers only a small part of that Membrane. In a Mare and Sow, there is a fleshy-like mass con- tained in the AUantois, which has been considered by some as the sediment of the Urine, and termed Hippo^ manes, or Horse-venom, the nature of which is imper- fectly understood. The AUantois is wanting in the Ape kind, and in a Hedge-hog, Dog, Cat, &c. in which is found a Mem- brane, termed Tunica Erythroides, which contains a watery fluid at the commencement of pregilancy, and is connected to the Mesenteric Vessels of the Foetus, but has no Urachus.

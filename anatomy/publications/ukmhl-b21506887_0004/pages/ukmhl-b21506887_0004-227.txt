Part II.] OF BIRDS. Â« of a most delicate texture, somewhat resembling the Choroid Coat, and termed Marsupium Nigrum^ Pecten, or Membrana Plicata^ from its colour and plaited ap- pearance. It arises in the bottom of the Eye, at the entrance of the Optic Nerve, passes obliquely through the Retina, and terminates at or near the edge of the Crystalline Lens. It is formed of Plicae, varying in number in dLfiPerent Birds, and is of a conical form, very Vascular, and covered with black paint. In an Ostrich and Cassowary it forms a kind of conical purse, whence the French term it Bourse Noire. It is sup- posed to absorb ray^ of light when too strong, or when the Animal attempts to look at near objects. And some have considered it as serving to move the Lens ; but Muscular Fibres have not been detected in it, and its oblique situation is also unfavourable to this. The Humours of the Eye are analogous to those in the former class. The Lens is flatter or rounder, in an inverse ratio to that of the Cornea. In Land Birds, it is flat, as in Mammalia ; in Aquatic, it is more of a globular form. The Muscles of the Eye, in Birds, are the same in number as in a Human Body ; but both the Obliqui come from the fore part of the Orbit, near each other. One is inserted below, the other above, without going through a pulley, as in Mammalia. The whole Mus- cles of the Ball are fixed to the soft part of the Scle- rotic, behind the Osseous Laminse, and are shorter in proportion than in the former class. This, together with the flat shape of the Ball, allows very little mo- tion. The Suspensory Muscle existing in Quadrupeds, is wanting in Birds.

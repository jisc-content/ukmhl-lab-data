178 URINARY AND MALE ORGANS [Part I. In an Ornithorrynchus, Elephant^ Amphibious Manir- malia, and Cetacea, they remain constantly in the Ab- domen, in the vicinity of the Kidneys ; and here, as in other cases where they are situated within that Cavity, they are covered by the Peritoneum, but want the Cre- master Muscle, which exists where^^r the Testicle passes out of the Abdomen. Besides the Scrotum, the Testicle, as in Man, has its Tunica Vaginalis, and, unless in Man and an Om- rang-Gutang-, there is constantly a small passage lead- ing between this Coat and the Abdomen, in such Ani- mals as have the Testes always in the Scrotum, but a large communication in those in which these Glands pass from, and to the Abdominal Cavity. In neither of these cases is the Animal in danger of Hernia, this being the highest part of the Belly, or at least, the Viscera press less upon the Abdominal Rings. The Testes are co- vered also in Mammalia by the Tunica Albuginea, which diflPers only in thickness. The form of the Testes is generally oval, sometimes round, as in a Rat, or very long, as in Amphibious Mammalia and Cetacea. The size, in many, increases greatly at rutting-time. The Seminal Tubes, in some Animals, are collected into Bundles, as in Baboons, most of the large Carni- vora, a Boar^ he. ; but in most of the Glires, and es- pecially Rats, the Tubes are large and parallel, and so loosely connected as to be easily separated from each other. In several Quadrupeds, as a Dog, Horse, Ram, &c. there is a Body termed Corpus Highmorianum, running longitudinally next the Epididymis, and composed of condensed Cellular Substance, which sends Septulae be-

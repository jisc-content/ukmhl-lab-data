" In the order Glires or Rodentia, the Temporal Bone has no Carotid Canal, the Artery entering between the Temporal and Sphenoid Bones. There is a considerable variety, also, among the other Foramina at the base of the Cranium ; those of the Cribriform Plate of the Ethmoid Bone being, in number and size, in propor- tion to the acuteness of smell. In the Ceiacea, the Ethmoid and Cribriform Plate are wanting. The three large Fossae at the inside of the Base of the Cranium in Quadrupeds, are more superficial as an Animal is removed from Man. In many Cariiivorous Animals, the Cavity for the Cerebellum is separated from that of the Cerebrum by a broad Osseous Lami- na, projecting from the inner side of the Cranium. The Skull of an Elephant presents a remarkable ap- pearance; the two Tables are separated from each other to a considerable distance, by an extraordinary thickness of Diploe. This is composed of numerous Osseous Plates, that form large Cells, communicating with each other, and then with the Eustachian Tube, which leads into the Throat. These Cells are filled with air, which, without adding to the weight of the Head, ailows it to be increased in size, for the attachment of the strong Muscles necessary for the motion of the Lower Jaw and Proboscis. In the Cetacea, the Skull is very globular, and the Face flat and small, the part analogous to the Nose being upon the summit of the Head. Face.â€”The size and form of the Face depends in a

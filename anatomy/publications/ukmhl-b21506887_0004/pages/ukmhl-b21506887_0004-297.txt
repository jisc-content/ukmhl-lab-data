In a Turtle, they terminate in the beginning of the Urethra, from whence the Urine goes into the Bladder. In many of the Li- zard tribe, the Ureters terminate in a Bladder, which is of considerable extent, and the Urethra opens into a Cloaca. In a Crocodile, the Ureters end in a Cloaca, there being no Bladder. In Serpents, each Ureter di- lates into a Vesicle, which terminates in a Cloaca. In general, they end in a Bladder or a Cloaca, as the Or- gan happens to exist. The Bladder, when present, receives the Urine at its Neck, or at the beginning of the Urethray^^^nd opens directly into the Cloaca. In the Genus Rana, viz. a Frog and Toad, there are two Bags, taken notice of by Blumenbach and CuviER, as Urinary Bladders. TowNSON, however, describes the Ureters in these Animals as terminating at the posterior part of the Rectum, as in Birds, while the Receptacles here men- tioned, and which are of great size, terminate at its an- terior part; and is of opinion, that the fluid they con- tain is pure water, which he has frequently tasted. He thinks this fluid is absorbed from the surface of the Skin, and serves the same purpose to these Ani- mals, as fluids do to those which take them into the Stomach by the Mouth ; that the fluid they eject pre- vents an inconvenience in leaping. In the Turtle tribe, the bottom of the Bladder di- vides into two Cornua. The Urethra, which is ex- tremely short, opens into the Cloaca. There are two

At the posterior extremity of the last Joint, the Vessels are found to be impervious. Ascarides have a simple Canal, and nearly equal throughout, running in a longitudinal direction. The anterior portion has a slight dilatation, considered as a sort of Stomach. A Lumbricus Humanus^ or Ascaris Lumbricoides, has a simple Canal, extending through the Body, and ending near the posterior extremity of the Animal. In a Trichuris Hominis, (a Worm about two incheslong, ending in a filiform Tail), the Intestinal Canal extends through the whole length of the Body. The Liver is wanting in all Worms. Organs of Generation.â€”Worms, like MoUusca, hav6 three diversities of Sexes ; 1. Separate Sexes ; 2. Sexes united ; 3. Sexes with reciprocal copulation. An A- phrodite has Sexes separate. Individuals of this genus are occasionally found full of Eggs in the intervals of the Viscera, but the preparatory Organs are not yet discovered. A Lumbricus Terrestris has the Organs at the under part of the Body, between the middle and the anterior extremity ; the Ovarium consists of small oval Sacs filled with Ova. There are two openings here with smaller ones, but no male parts are observed, though they closely adhere in copulation. Hydatids, so frequently found in the Liver and other parts of the Body in Mammalia, have been con- sidered by some as Animals, consisting merely of a Sto- mach ; by others, as a Matrix or Womb, from something like young Hydatids being frequently found adhering to their inner side.

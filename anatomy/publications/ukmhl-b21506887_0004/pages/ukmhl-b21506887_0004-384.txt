OF WORMS. [Part VIII. 380 immediately after being obtained from a living Animal, are observed to have a contractile power, but they have no external opening. They are of different sizes and kinds ; most commonly there is either one or more Hy- datids floating in the same Cyst. Each consists of two Coats, the inner of which is extremely delicate. Neither of them possesses any visible Blood-vessels, though the Sac containing them has abundance of Ves- sels, Nerves, &c. derived from those of the Organ with which it is connected. Hydatids ought not to be con- founded with watery Vesicles, connected occasionally with the Kidney, &c. which are not inclosed in Cysts, have no small Hydatids adhering to their inner surface, and want contractility. In other Animals, a Hydatid is found, with a Head and Mouth, by which it adheres to the inner surface of the Sac which incloses it. In a Leech, the Sexes are double in each individual, and they have reciprocal copulation. The Male parts consist of two Testes, each formed of a convoluted Duct. A short Vas Deferens, ending in a kind of Pe- nis, is observed at the under side, near the anterior ex- tremity. In the vicinity of this is a Vagina, which seems to receive the Penis of the other individual. The Liimbrici Intestinorum have distinct Sexes. In the Male, a thread-like Vessel, four or five times the length of the Animal, much convoluted, but easily un- ravelled, composes the Testis. This forms a Vesicula Seminalis, which is equal to upwards of a third part of the length of the Body, and is sometimes nearly as large as a crow-quill, full of a milky liquor. The Vesicula ends in a Penis concealed near the posterior extremity of the Animal.

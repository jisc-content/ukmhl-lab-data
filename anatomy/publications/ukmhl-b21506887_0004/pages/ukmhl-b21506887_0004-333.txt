There are, in most Fishes, four Gills in each side, resting on an equal number of arched portions of Car- tilage or Bone, connected to the Os Hyoides; and these are fixed to the Head, or to the first Vertebrae. Each of the Gills consists of two ranges of Cartila- ginous Laminae, and are joined together for two-thirds of their inner edge. The Laminae issue like rays, and have the Branches of the Pulmonary Artery minutely dispersed upon them. In many Cartilaginous Fishes, as a Raja, Squalus, &c. there are five Gills on each side. In a Lampre?/ there are seven. In a small Animal, the Hippocampus, eight.

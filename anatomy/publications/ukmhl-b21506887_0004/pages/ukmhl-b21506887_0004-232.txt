[Part II. OF THE MOUTH, &c. 228 OF THE MOUTH AND THROAT, WITH THEIR APPENDAGES. The part supplying the place of Teeth, in Birds, is the Rostrum, or Bill, which is formed of a Horny Sub- stance similar to the Claws and Spurs, and moulded upon the Osseous part of the Jaws. The form and Texture of the Bill correspond with the habits and food of the Animal. In Rapacious Birds, as an Eagle, the Bill is hard and hooked at the end, for seizing and lacerating the prey. It is also of a very firm texture in Birds that bruise hard seeds. In those which live upon softer Food, it is more delicate ; and in such as the Duck kind, which search for their food in water or mud, it becomes soft and remarkably sen- sible. Many Birds, particularly in the orders Accipitres and GallincB^ have a soft Skin covering the base of the Bill, which gets the name of Cire, (wax), the use of which is not yet ascertained. Tongue and Salivary Glands. All Birds are furnished with a Tongue, the form and structure of whicli vary much in different Genera and Species. It has Papillae of different forms, some fleshy, soft, and rounded, others Cartilaginous, and placed on its root, and also on the Palate, to prevent the Food from escaping after it has entered the Mouth.

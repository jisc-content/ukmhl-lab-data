OF THE EYE [Pakt IV, 314 and supplying the place of the convexity of this part of the Eye. In some Fishes, as the Skate and Sharlc tribe, the Eye rests upon a stalk of Cartilage, or expands behind into a kind of Tubercle, which allows the Muscles to act with more advantage upon it. In other Fishes, it rests upon Gelatinous matter in form of a Cone, contain- ed in loose Cellular Substance. Fishes are destitute of Eye-lids ; but, to defend this Organ from injury, the Tunica Adnata is stronger than in Mammalia and Birds, and passes immediately over it without forming any doubling. It may be separated readily from the Tunica Sclerotica and the Cornea. Upon the inner or back part of the Cornea is a delicate Membrane, termed Tunica Aquea, which incloses the Aqueous Humour at the fore part of the Eye; this can also be easily separated. In some, as an Eel, the Tunica Adnata allows the Cornea to move behind it, in the manner it does in Serpents, &c. The Cornea is not so firmly connected to the Sclero- tic as in Mammalia; it is readily separated from the Sclerotis, which appears then open at the fore part of the Iris. Most Osseous Fishes, as a Salmon^ Macherel, &c. have, at each corner of the Orbit, a Vertical Veil, which covers a small part of the Eye. The Tunica Sclerotica is Cartilaginous, semi-trans- parent, and lined with a delicate Membrane, which is commonly of a black colour. Fishes have no Tapetum on the Choroid Coat, the inner Layer of which, or Tunica Ruyschiana, is black,

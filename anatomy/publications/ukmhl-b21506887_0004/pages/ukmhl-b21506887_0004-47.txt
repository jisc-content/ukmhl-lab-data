Part I.] 43 OF MAMMALIA. TRUNK. The Trunk in Mammalia, as in a Human Body, is divided by Anatomists into Spine, Pelvis, and Tho- rax, the first of which is the most constant part of the Skeleton. The Spine has the same number of Cervical Vertebrae in the different individuals of this class as in a Human body, excepting the three-toed Sloth, which, instead of seven, has nine. In the Ape tribe, the Cervical Vertehrce differ from those in Man, chiefly in the Spinous Processes being proportionally stronger, and not forked. In the Feroe, the Spinal Holes are almost in the Bodies of the Verte- brae. The first and second Vertebras in these Animals are remarkable, the former for the strength of its Transverse, the latter for that of its Spinous Pro- cesses ; these parts affording attachment to the power- ful Muscles which correspond with the other parts in enabling an Animal to seize its prey, or defend itself. In an Armadillo, and other Animals of this order, the six last Cervical Vertebrae are in a manner soldered together, and have a kind of Groove in which the Eso- phagus is lodged. In the Cetacea, the Bodies of the Cervical Vertebrae are remarkably thin, and two or three of them are frequently anchylosed. The Dorsal Vertebrce in true Quadrupeds have the anterior Spinous Processes augmented, in proportion as the Head is heavy or joined to a long neck, for the more advantageous attachment of the Muscles and the Ligamcntum Nucha?.

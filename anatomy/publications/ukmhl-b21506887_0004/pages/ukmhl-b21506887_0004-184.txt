In many Animals, each Vas Deferens unites with the Vesicula of its side ; in others, the Vasa Deterentia and Ducts from the Vesiculae terminate by a common opening in the Verumontanum. In the Ape tribe, the appearance of the Vesiculae Se- minales is nearly the same as in a Human Body. In most of the Glires, they are remarkable for their great size. The Vesiculae of a Sqiiirrel are particular, in being placed upon the inner side of the Vasa Deferentia. In a Rat, they , are so large as to be partly without the Pelvis. A Guinea Pig has them of a long cylin- drical form,, and containing a cheesy-like substance. In a Hare, their place is supplied by a rectangular Sac, which has in one part a Glandular appearance, and opens into the Verumontanum along with the Vas Deferens. In a Hedge-hog-, they exceed the size of the Testes, forming on each side four or five Fasciculi, each of which is composed of a Tube wonderfully con- voluted. The different Tubes join intoone Canal, that opens into the Verumontanum along with the Vas De- ferens. In a Horse, Boar, Elephant, and Rhinoceros, the Vesiculae are of great size, and form on each side a common Duct with the Vas Deferens. VesiculoeAccessoricB.â€”These are Membranous Tubes, varying in number, and situated at the inner side of the Vesiculae Seminales, or at the origin of the Ure- thra. They terminate by one or more Excretory Ducts, in common with the Vesiculae Seminales and Vasa De- ferentia, or separately. They are like the Vesicula?

m6 OF THE INTEGUxVIENTS [Part IV. Upon the surface of Fishes, particularly in such as live in salt water, there are Ducts, varying in number according to the kind, which pour out a Mucus to de- fend the Skin from the penetrating eiFects of the water. Those destitute of distinct scales, as the Skate tribe, have this Mucus in greatest abundance. In a Raja and Squalus, a set of transparent Ducts originate from a point on each side of the back of the Animal, directly over theangle of the Jaw, andalittleto the outer and back part of the Eye. From this, as a cen- tre, the Ducts issue in Fasciculi, and extend in Radii of different lengths, between the Skin and the Muscles. They are shut at their origin, have no visible Glands, nor have they any evident communication with each other. Each has an opening of considerable size upon the surface of the Body, where they pour out clear slime in large quantities, to defend the Skin, which, in Fishes of this kind, is less scaly than in others. Upon the beginning of these Canals, where they issue from a centre, a large Nerve, the third Branch of the fifth pair, is dispersed in radiated Branches, where they become suddenly transparent, and vanish in the Coats of the Ducts. Upon the under surface of these same kind of Fish- es, there are also Mucous Ducts, of a similar nature / with the former, but more irregular in their course. Besides the Ducts mentioned above, there are others much larger, upon the inferior or ventral surface, which likewise discharge Mucus for the defence of the Skin. They are situated at the sides of the Mouth, and upon the Lateral Fins, and take a serpentine direction. In a Torpedo, the Mucous Ducts are less in number

[Part IV. OP THE EAR 913 in a narrow passage, or Meatus Auditorius Externus, which pierces the Cranium. This goes directly to a Sac belonging to the Labyrinth or Internal Ear, there being no Membrana Tympani in Fishes. The Labyrinth is situated at the back and outer part of the Brain-case, a little behind the Eye, and is found by cutting almost horizontally, but a little downwards and outwards, through the substance of the Cranium; the Animal being supposed to be placed in the prone situation. Between the Labyrinth and Brain-case, there is a distinct partition, which communicates only by the Meatus Auditorius and the passage for the Nerves. The Internal Ear consists of a Membranous Laby- rinth, contained in a Cartilaginous one, hollowed out in the Substance of the Cranium The Cartilaginous Labyrinth somewhat resembles the Membranous in form, and is composed of an An- trum and three semicircular, or rather circular Canals, all of which are lined with a Perichondrium ; but the Cartilaginous parts greatly exceed the Membranous in size. At the inner side of this Cavity are the passages for the Nerves ; at the outer, there is a kind of Fenestra Ovalis, which is shut only by a Membrane covered by the Skin. The Membranous Labyrinth is formed of a large triangular Sac, slanting obliquely outwards and down- wards, and is analogous to the Sacculus Vestibuli in Mammalia. It has also three semicircular Canals, in each of which there is an Ampulla, more conspicuous than in most other Animals,

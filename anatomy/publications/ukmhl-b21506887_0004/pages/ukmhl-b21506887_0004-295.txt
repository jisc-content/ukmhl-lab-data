Part III.] OF BIRDS. 291 The Gail-Bladder is also present in ail Reptiles, but is of smaller size than in the former class. In a Tortoise and Crocodile, it is closely connected to the Liver ; in Serpents, it lies at a distance from that Viscus. As in Birds, the Trunks of the Hepatic and Cystic Ducts are separate from each other, though with se- veral exceptions. Hepato-ci^stic Ducts go commonly into the Body of the Gall-bladder, or into its Neck, or the beginning of its Duct. In a Crocodile, the Hepatic Duct sends a Branch to the Neck of the Gall-bladder, and unites with the Cystic near its termination in the Intestines. In a Turtle, the Hepatic Duct gives a branch to the beginning of the Cystic, but the two Canals open separately into the Intestine. Fancreas. The form and situation of the Pancreas varies much in Reptiles. In some, as a Tortoise, it is triangular ; in others, as a Crocodile, lobed; and in others, as Serpents and Frogs, it is irregular, and in the former, is situated on the right side of the Intestines. The Pancreatic Duct is single in some, and double in others. In some, as a Salamander Terrestris, it is inserted before, and in others, as a Crocodile, after the insertion of the Biliary Duct. T %

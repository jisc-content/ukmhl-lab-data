OF THE NOSE. [Part I. 112 the Head, where they are twice inflected upon the Inter- maxillary Bones, and fixed round the Osseous Nares. This part is protected by the Cartilage of the Nose, which is of an oval form, and so much more convex in a Male than a Female, that by this it is said the sex can be distinguished. The Tubes are covered with a strong Tendinous Membrane, and perforated by many Mucous Follicles, which open into their Cavities. They are separated from each other, and are both surrounded by a quanti- ty of white Adipose Substance, which also extends be- tween the different Muscles that occupy the space be- tween the Tubes and the Skin, and which have been already described. The outer part is covered by the Common Integuments, which are lined with a Tendi- nous Membrane and Cellular Substance. The Proboscis serves to pump up the drink which the Animal takes in, but, according to Cuvier, the Tubes want that delicate structure internally, which is necessary for the Organ of smell; so that, in his opinion, this sense in an Elephant is confined to that part of the Nostrils contained in the Bones of the Head. In Cetacea, the Nares and Spiracula differ much from the Organ of smell in other Mammalia, being placed on the summit of the Head, and serving as pas- sages of respiration, and for the rejection of the water which enters the Mouth along with their Food. The two Osseous Nares are placed so high on the Head, that the Animal can breathe while the Mouth is under water. They are furnished with two semicircular fleshy Valves, which are shut by a strong Muscle. On the upper side of the Valves are two Membranous

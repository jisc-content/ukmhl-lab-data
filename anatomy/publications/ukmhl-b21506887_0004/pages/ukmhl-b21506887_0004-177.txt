Part L] OF MAMMALIA. 17S ing, farther forward than the left. The form is most frequently like that in Man, but sometimes Globular, as in a Dog ; triangular, as in a Horse ; and long, as in a Hog; but the greatest difference is in their division into Lobes* In many of the Glires, and in the different Ferce, they are simple, each having a Cortical and a Medul- lary part, with only one Papilla. In many individuals of the class, they form what are termed Conglomerated KidjieySj being divided, not only in a Foetus, as in a Human Subject, but during life, into a collection of smaller Kidneys. In an Ox and Elephant, the Kidneys are separated into Lobes, of which there are in the for- mer between twenty and thirty, and in the latter four; but they are deeply divided in a Bear^ Otter^ and other Amphibia, and in Cetacea, so much so, as to ap- pear like a bunch of grapes, and are connected only by their Sanguiferous and Urinary Vessels. These Lobes are for the most part numerous, being in a Bear fifty or sixty, and in some of the Cetacea, the number is still greater; but the cause of this division is not as- certained. It has been supposed that they are peculiar to Animals which live in Water, or frequent that fluid ; but a Brown or Land Bear has the Lobular Kid- ney, as well as a Polar one, which inhabits the coasts and water. The limits of their two substances are commonly dis- tinct, but they have not always the same proportional thickness; in some the Cortical being three or four times thicker than the Medullary part. The Medul- lary Substance does not constantly terminate in Papil- l9e^ In a Dog, Cat, some of the Opvssums, &c. the

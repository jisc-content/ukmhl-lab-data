S46 OF MOLLUSCA. [Part V. composed of a Membrano-muscular substance, termed Cloak. This, in the greater part of the Species, is covered by Shells of various forms, and furnished with complete hinges. These hinges are connected by Li- gaments placed in different parts of the Shell accord- ing to the kind, and of such an elastic nature as to have a constant tendency to open the Shell. The Cloak varies much in the different Genera. Most fre- quently it is open before, as in an Oyster^ Muscle^ &c. Sometimes it is perforated at both extremities, as in a Razor-shell, &c. The Cloak of an Oyster is formed, like the Shell, of two pieces fixed next the hinge, and has a semi-transparent appearance. The pieces are perforated by the Muscle which closes the Shell. The opening which receives the nourishment, and that for discharging the Faeces, are formed by the Cloak, and these are sometimes prolonged into a Proboscis. In an Oyster oxidi Muscle, there is only one of these open- ings, which is the Anus ; the nourishment entering by a slit in the Cloak. The Valves of the Shells are closed by one or two Muscles, according to the shape of the part. In an Oyster, and others of a similar form, there is only a single Muscle, but of great strength. It is situated near the centre of the Shell, and behind the Liver. It is fixed firmly to both portions of the Shell, ,and shuts them with great force ; the elastic Ligament at the hinge acts as an antagonist, by opening the Shell. In a Muscle, Cockle, Razor-shell, he, there are two Muscles for shutting the Shell, and they are placed near the hinge. Many Acephalous Mollusca have a locomotive power?

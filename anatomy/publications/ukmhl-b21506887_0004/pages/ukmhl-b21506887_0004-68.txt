In other Mammalia, it varies a little in its general appearance and attachment, according to the nature of the Jaw, and of the motions it has to perform. Muscles about the Neck and Throat.—The place of the Platysma Myoides is supplied by the Panniculus Carnosus. The Sterno-mastoideus is nearly as in Man, but is blended in various ways with the Trapezius and Del- toides. The Sterno-hyoid and Sterno-thyroid Muscles arise in common with the Cartilaginous Extremity of the first Rib ; but in a Lion^ the origin of the former ex- tends in the Thorax, along the three anterior Bones of the Sternum. In a Seal, where the anterior Extremity of the Sternum is slender, the Sterno-hyoideus arises from the first Rib. The Stylo-hyoideus is perforated by the Digastricus in an Ape, but not in other Quadrupeds. . In Quadrupeds possessing a Styloid Process, there is a Muscle peculiar to them, termed Stylo-mastoideus, which arises from the outer surface of the Mastoid Pro- cess, and is fixed to the Styloid, which it raises out- wards. Some Carnivora have also a small Muscle fill- ing the space between the Cornua of the Os Hyoides. The other Muscles connected with the Os Hyoides vary in diffierent i^nimals, according to the shape of the Bone. Muscles situated on the Inferior and Lateral Parts of the Ahdomcn.—the Abdominal Muscles differ from those

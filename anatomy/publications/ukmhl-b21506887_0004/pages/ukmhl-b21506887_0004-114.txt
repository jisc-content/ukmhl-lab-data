110 OF THE NOSE. [Part I. Ferce, as a Lion, there is only a double roll something like that in Pecora. Cartilages,â€”The Cartilages of the Nose vary con- siderably in different Quadrupeds. Those in the Ape tribe differ from the analogous parts in Man chiefly in their diminutive size. The Muscles affecting the Nose, in these Animals, appear to be part of the Pan- niculus Carnosus. In Carnivorous Animals, as a Dog, in which the Nose does not project beyond the Mouth, the Cartilages also bear a considerable resemblance to those in the Human Species. In Carnivorous Animals with moveable Snouts, as a Mole and Bear, the Carti- lages form a complete Tube, which is connected to the edge of the Osseous part of the Nose. The Snout of a Hog bears a considerable resem- blance to that of a Mole, but its Cartilages are shorter in proportion. The Nose of Carnivorous Animals has distinct longi- tudinal Muscles, the ends of which, and the Snout it- self, are covered with Circular Fibres, continued from the Orbicular Muscles of the Lips, as already observed. In Solipeds and Ruminants, the Osseous Nares are large, and have a Notch in their lateral parts. The soft portion of the Nose, connected to the Bones, forms the Nostrils, strictly so called, the edges of which, in a Horse, inclose a Cartilage, called Semilunar. The rest of the external part is merely a fold of the Skin, and forms a Cavity termed False Naris, which has the same common opening with the Nostril. The Muscles of the Nose are noticed in a former part of the Volume. The Pituitary Membrane agrees in its general struc- ture with that in Man. Its surface has numerous

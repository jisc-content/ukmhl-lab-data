Part V.] OF MOLLUSCA. 345 thickness in different individuals. In Testaceous Mol- lusca, it covers the Shell on both sides, and may be readily separated from it by means of diluted acids. Most of this class produce a viscid liquor^ which lubri- cates the Skin. In the Mollusca Testacea, the Shell is formed in a peculiar viscous substance, the Sacculus Calcareus of Swammerdam. The Muscles agree, in many particulars, with those of the Animals of thfe former class. In Mollusca Ce- phalopoda^ the Sac which composes the Body is form- ed of a Muscular substance, divided into Layers, fitted for moulding the Animal into various forr/is. Two strong Muscles arise from each side of the Sac inter- nally, and are fixed to the Head. The Tentacula round the Mouth have Muscles, some for acting di- rectly upon them, others proper to the Suckers or Cups which are placed upon them. The first set enable the Animal to move the Tentacula in every direction, the second contract the cups from a flat to a hollow sur- face ; and by forming a kind of vacuum within them, enable the Creature to fix itself firmly to surrounding objects. The Muscles of locomotion, in Gasteropoda, reside in the under part of their Body, which serves them at once as a sort of belly and foot. It consists of fleshy fibres running variously, by which it can contract a part or the whole of the Body at the same time, as may be readily perceived in a Slug or common Snail. In Gasteropoda, as a Snail or Limpet^ there are addi- tional Muscles arising from the inner surface, or from the edge of the Shell, by which the Animal can pro- trude from, or retire into its covering. Acephala, as an Oyster, Muscle, &c. have a covering principally

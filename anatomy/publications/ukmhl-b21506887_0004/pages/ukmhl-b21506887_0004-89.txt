Part I.] OP MAMMALIA. 85 rent states of fatness and leanness ; but taking things in a very general way, it is found that small Animals have the brain largest in proportion. The largest Brain Soemmereing found in a Horse weighed 1 lb. 4 oz. while the smallest in Man was 2 lb. 5ioz.; yet the Nerves in the former were ten times larger than those in the latter. Dr Monro 9^dus^ found the Brain in an Ox only one fourth the weight of that of a Human Brain, while the weight of the Body of the former was six times greater than that of the latter ; or, a Human Brain is twenty- four times greater in proportion to the weight of the Body, than that of an Ox. In Man^ at different times of life, its weight varies from a 22d in a young person, to a 85th of the Body in a Subject advanced in life. In an Ourang-outang, it is a 48th; in other Apes, it varies from a 22d to upwards of a 100th; in a Mouse, it is a 41st; in a Rat, a 76th ; in a Hare, a S28th ; in a Mole, a 36th ; in Dogs, from a 47th to a S05th; in a Cat, a 94th;-in a. Bear, a 265th; in a Horse, sl 400th ; in an Ox, an 860th; in Hogs, from a 412th to a 512th; in Dolphins, from a 25th to a 102d ; in a Porpoise, a 91st. The proportion which the Cerebrum bears to that of the Cerebellum is as follows. In Man, as 6 to 1 ; in Apes, from as 6 to 1 to as 14 to 1 ; in a Mouse, as 2 to 1 ; in a Rat, as 3J to 1 ; in a Hare, as 6 to 1; in a Mole, as 4J to 1 ; in a Dog, as 8 to 1; in a Cat, as 6 to 1; in a Horse, as 7 to 1; in an Ox, as 9 to 1 ; in a Sheep, as 5 to 1.

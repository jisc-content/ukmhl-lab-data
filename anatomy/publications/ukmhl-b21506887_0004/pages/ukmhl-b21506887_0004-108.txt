OF THE EAR. 104 [Part I. some, as a Bear^ the Cochlear Foramen is triangular ; in others, as an Ant-eater, both the Foramina are oval, and nearly equal in size. In Carnivora, Solipeds, Ru- minants, and Cetacea, the Cochlear Foramen is the largest; in some it is double or triple the size. In a Hare and Opossum, the Vestibular Opening is by much the largest. In all Mammalia, the two Foramina are filled, the Cochlear with Membrane, and the Vestibular with Bone. The Labyrinth is nearly similar to that in Man, but the proportional size varies much among the different Species. As in a Human Subject, also, it is common- ly hollowed out in the Pars Petrosa; but in some, as a Bat and Mole^ it is visible in the Cranium without any preparation. In some it is large ; in others, small. The Cochlea is almost always turbinated, and the number of turns are commonly the same in the diffe- rent individuals, excepting a few, as a Guinea Pig, Porcupine, and Indian Hog, where there is a turn more, and Cetacea, where there is a turn less, than in Man. In most Carnivora, and in a Horse, Hog, and Ele- phant, the Cochlea is larger in proportion to the semi- circular Canals than in Man. In Bats, it is remark- ably large, compared with the Canals. The size of the two Canals of the Cochlea is in general nearly equal; but in some, as a Dog, Horse, and ElepJiarit, the Scala Tympani is the larger. In Cetacea, the semicircular Canals are proportionally so small that by some they have been overlooked, and by others, as Dr Camper, their existence has been denied.

I Part I.] OF MAMMALIA. 189 appearance of two Horns, which open separately into the Vagina, as in a Hare and Rabbit. 4i. A Double Uterus with extraordinary lateral convo- lutions, or Uterus Anfractuosus, as in an Opossum and Kanguroo. The Uterus of these Animals has several longitudinal folds, one of which runs through its whole length, and divides it into two equal parts. The Cor- nua Uteri, contracted at first, soon dilate into large Cavities, each of which sends out a narrow Fallopian Tube, which is fixed to the extremity of the Ovarium. From the corner of the Uterus, on each side, a C^nal ' arises, which, after making a circuitous turn, approaches its fellow, and terminates in the Vagina, by a narrow orifice, at each side of the Meatus Urinarius. The Ovaf^ia, in Mammalia, are as constant in a Female, as the Testes are in a Male. They are fre- quently situated near the Kidneys, are of an oval form, and have the Ova buried in their substance. In a Pig, they are tuberculated; in a Hedge-hog, they are in the form of a cluster of grapes. The number of Ova corresponds with that of the the young which a Female is capable of producing during life. The structure of the Uterine Tubes is generally the same as in the Human Species. In Uteri with Cornua, they are fixed to the latter, and are convoluted; but their diameter is always smaller than that of the Cornua. The Vagina is a continuation of the Uterus, and lies in the same axis with that Organ. It is in proportion to the size of the Penis in a Male, and to that of the Foetus, which has to pass through it. It has generally Rugae running longitudinally, to favour its dilatation.

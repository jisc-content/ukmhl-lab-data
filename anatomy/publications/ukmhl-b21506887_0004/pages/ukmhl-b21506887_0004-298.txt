t94 OF THE MALE ORGANS [Pakt III. projections in each side, once pierced by the Ureter, the other by the Vas Deferens. From the above it fol- lows, that the Bladder exists in a Turtle ; in many Li- zards^ though not in all; and in Serpents; and that, in Frogs, there are receptacles considered by some as a Bladder, and by others as of a different nature. Near the Kidneys, but unconnected with them, are t\vo small Bodies, considered by some as Renal Glands, by others, as connected with the Organs of Generation. CuviER looks upon them as a kind of Omentum. In a Turtle, they are attached to the Renal Veins. In Lizards and Serpents, they lie in a ply of the Perito- neum, connecting the Ova and Oviducts. In a Frog, they are fringed Bodies, like the Testes or Ovaria, and fixed to the Emulgent Veins. OF THE MALE ORGANS OF GENERATION, The situation of the Testes in the different orders of this class, is very analogous to that in Birds, being con- stantly in the Abdomen, in the vicinity of the Kidneys. In Turtles, Lizards^ and Serpents, they are variable in their form, and are fasciculated. In Frogs, they are like Granulae closely connected.

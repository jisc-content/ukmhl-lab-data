A pair of Nerves belong to the Muscles of the Sac, and another to the Organ of Hearing. A pair near the Heart forms a Plexus, which supplies the dif- ferent Viscera. In a Sepia Loligo, the Brain consists of a small round body, behind which are two little Lobes analogous to the Cerebellum. These send off a mere Filament in place of a Spinal Marrow. On each side of the Brain is a large mass, which sends off the Optic Nerve. In a Snail and Slug, the Brain is situated, in the former over, and in the latter behind, the Esophagus, and sends off a Process on each side of it, both uniting below into a large Ganglion, from which and the Brain, Nerves are sent to the different parts of the Body. E^e.â€”Sepia alone of this class of Animals pos- sess true Eyes. Here we observe their great size, and the Skin covering them loosely as in Serpents ; a transparent Membrane underneath, which supplies the place of a Cornea, and to which the Lens is closely con- nected without the intervention of an Aqueous Humour; the Iris intimately connected to the Sclerotica, and a Semilunar Process projecting at the edge of the Pupil; the Ciliary Processes large, and forming a Zone about the Lens; between the Sclerotic and Choroid Coats, Glandular Bodies and the Ganglion of the Optic Nerve, which separate these two Coats from each other ; the inner surface of the Choroides of a deep purple colour, and only two Muscles belonging to the Ball of the Eye. The parts considered as the Eye of Mollusca with Ten taenia, or Horns, as a Snail and Slug, are placed

SOO OF THE BONES [Part IV. as Birds, have a partition between the Eyes, which has been compared to a Vomer; and this is generally Mem- branous, though in some Osseous. In Fishes of the Cartilaginous kind, the Under Jaw differs from that in the Osseous, in not being articulat- ed with the Cranium, but through the medium of the Bone, analogous to the Os Quadrature in Birds. In each side of the Cranium of Osseous Fishes, as in Birds, there is a great moveable Bone, which supports the Palatine Arches and the Lower Jaw. In the Squa- lus or Sharif kind, the two Jaws are very moveable. Each is composed of a pair of Cartilages, joined at the fore part. The Upper has two Condyles, by which it is articulated with the Lower Jaw. It has also two small Inter-articular Cartilages. Nearly the same structure is found in a Sturgeon. The Teeth of Fishes vary in form, number, and si- tuation, and, strictly speaking, are a set of hard pro- minent Bodies, placed in some part of the Mouth, or Throat, merely for grasping their prey, and prevent- ing it from escaping, their Food not requiring mandu- cation. Some Species of Spams have Front Teeth, simple, and with Fangs fixed in the Alveoli, almost similar to those in the Human Body. In general, simple Teeth, with Fangs in the Alveoli, are a continuation of the Alveoli, but differing from them in their structure, and in being covered with Ena- mel, as in Mammalia. In some, as a Squalus, the Teeth are also simple, but joined only to the Gums, and grow in the manner of Epiphyses. In some, the Teeth are conical and blunt; in others, flat and round,

152 OF THE STOMACH. [Part I found to be more fully digested ; from which circum- stance this kind of Stomach forms a medium between that Ruminants, and the Stomach of Animals entire- ly Villous on the inner side. All Pecora have a plurality of Stomachs, some two, others three, and some four. In all of them, the Sto- mach is compound, and more complicated, both in structure and appearance, than in any other order of Mammalia. They are the only Quadrupeds which ru- minate their Food. Taking an Ox for a general ex- ample of the structure of this Organ, the first Stomach is the Ventriculus, or Paunch, which occupies a great part of the Abdomen, especially in the left side. It is by much the largest of the four. It has two Sacs or Appendices externally, and is slightly divided into four apartments internally. The inner surface is covered with innumerable Papillae, of different size in different parts. The second Stomach is termed Reticulum, Bonnet, or Honey-comb Bag, and appears as a Globular appen- dage of the Paunch. It is placed at the right side of the Esophagus, and anterior part of the Paunch, and has generally a thicker Muscular Coat than it. Its inner surface is arranged into irregular Pentagonal Cells, and covered with fine Papillae. The third is the smallest, and called Omasum, or Many Plies. It is situated on the right side of the Paunch, is of a Globular form, and has a thinner Mus- cular Coat than the two former. It consists of nume- rous broad Laminae sent off from the Internal Coat, running in a longitudinal direction, alternately varying in breadth, and covered with small Granulous Papillae.

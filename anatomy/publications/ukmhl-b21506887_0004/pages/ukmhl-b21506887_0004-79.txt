Part I.] OF MAMMALIA. 75 Animals, and sometim^js in different parts of the same individual. In Cetacea, it is thicker than in any other Animal. The colour of this substance is also very variable. In some Apes, it is white on the Cheeks ; in others, it is of a violet or carmine colour on the Nose and Buttocks. On the Belly of a Whale, it is of a silver white. A connexion also is observed to subsist in some Quadrupeds, between the colour of this sub- stance and that of the Palate and Iris. The Cutis is more variable in its thickness than the Cuticle. In the Wing of a Bat, it is remarkably thin. In most of the Belluce, as an Elephant and Rhinoceros, it is of great thickness, but much more so on the Back than the Belly. In these Animals, it is deeply fissured. The Cuticle, here also very thick, follows the fissures to their bottom. The Nervous Papillce of the Skin are nearly of a si- milar nature in all Mammalia to those in Man, and are also most distinct in parts most susceptible of touch. Their figures vary considerably, but their structure is nearly the same, as may be seen by macerating them for some time in water. They are very apparent in the Snout of a Mole, Hog, Elephant, he. and on the Fin- gers of the Monkey tribe. They have a thread-like form on the Paws of a Bear, and some of the other digitated Animals. They have an elegant appearance at the Teats oi a Balena, or true Whale; and are very distinct on the Tongue of Solipeds and Rurni* nants, and in the Wings of Bats, A sixth sense has of late been ascribed to the Nervous Papillae in the Skin of a Bat, which is found to pre- vent the Animal from coming against external objects.

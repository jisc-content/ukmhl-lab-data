PART III. OF REPTILES. OF THE BONES, The general structure of the Skeleton of Reptiles va- ries much in the different orders of the class. The Cranium^ for the most part, is large in proportion to the size of the Brain, though small when compared with the bulk of the Head. In a TurilCy the apparent magnitude of the Head is owing to the Accessory Bones, between which and the Cranium there is a large space occupied by Muscles and Glands, and by the Organs of Vision. The Cra- nium is joined to the Vertebrae of the Neck by a single Occipital Condyle. ^ The Lower Jaw is composed of five pieces, one in the middle, and two at each side ; and is articulated somewhat after the manner of the articulation in Birds. It has no Condyle^ but a hollow articular surface, which is joined to an eminence of the Temporal Bone; a structure the reverse of that in Mammalia. R 2

Tart I.f OF MAMMALIA. 153 The fourth Stomach is the Ohomasum^ Ventriculus Intestinalis, Caille or Red. It has a Pyriform appear- ance, and is next in size to the Paunch. It has large longitudinal Rugjje, covered with Villi, in which cir- cumstance it is somewhat like the Stomach of a Dog. The Muscular Coat is still thinner than that of the for- mer. The fourth Stomach in a Foetus, with the Milk curdled in it, forms Runnet; but it is observed, that in all Animals, there is only one digestive Stomach, and this has also the power of curdling Milk. The in- ner surface of the three first Stomachs is covered only with a fine Cuticle, while that of the fourth has the ap- pearance of being a real Mucous or secreting Mem- brane. Upon examining the openings of the Stomachs, the Esophagus is observed to open into the right of the ^ Paunch, and at the same place, by a Gutter, into the second and third Stomachs. The third leads in, by a narrow opening, to the fourth ; and this terminates in the Duodenum, which has a Pylorus at its origin. In the different individuals of this order, the Sto- mach varies in proportion as the Animal advances to- wards maturity. While it is young, and fed upon Milk, its fourth Stomach is the largest. The Milk passes at once into this Cavity, very little going into the other three. As soon as the Creature begins to eat Solid Food, it acquires the power of ruminating. It lays hold of the grass, &c. by pressing it with the Tongue against the roof of the Mouth, and, by the Gums of the Upper, and Teeth of the Under Jaw, as- sisted by a twist of the Head, tears it across. After a slight mastication, the Aliment passes into the Paunch,

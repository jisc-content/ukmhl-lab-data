I ^02 OF THE BONES [Part II. and may be considered as enlargements of the Orbitar Portions. The Cavity of the Cranium is divided into two prin- cipal Fossae, one for the Cerebrum, the other for the Thalami Optici, Cerebellum, and Medulla Oblongata. The number of the Bones of the Cranium is nearly the same, originally, as in a Human Body. The Orbits are of great size. In some, they are separated by a Membrane ; in others, by a partition more or less Os- seous. The Temporal Bones have no Zygomatic Pro- cesses. The Cranium, in the whole of the class, is join- ed to the Bones of the Neck, by a single hemispheri- cal Condyle, placed at the fore part of the Foramen Magnum. The relative magnitude of the Cranium and Jaws varies much in Birds. In some, as an Owl, the Bill bears a small proportion to the large Cranium; in others, as a Rhinoceros Bird, it is of an extraordinary size. The Nasal and Palatine Openings also vary much in different Birds ; in a Stork, they are small; in a Crane, remarkably large. The Upper Jaw, or Mandible, in most Birds, is more or less moveable. It either constitutes a parti- cular Bone articulated with the Cranium, as in the Parrot kind, or is united with it into one piece, by means of elastic Bony Plates, as in Birds in general. It is immoveable in a few, as in a Cock of ihe Wood, and a Rhinoceros Bird. ^ a i i \ The Teeth are wanting in the different individuals of this class, the Bill supplying their place, yet act- ing like the Fore-teeth of those Animals that use them for seizing their prey.

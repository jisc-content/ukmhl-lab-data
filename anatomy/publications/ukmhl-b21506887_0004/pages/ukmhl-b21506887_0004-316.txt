312 OF THE BRAIN, &c. [Part IV. direction from the Dorsal to the Abdominal Skin. When the Integuments are raised, the Organ appears, consisting of some hundred pentagonal or hexagonal columns, closely compacted, and giving somewhat the appearance of a Honeycomb. The Columns are form- ed of transparent Laminae, and are connected together by transverse Tendinous Fibres. They are divided by a great number of thin partitions placed over each other, but leaving small spaces between them, which are full of a glairy liquor. Minute Blood-vessels are dispersed upon this Organ. Its Nerves are of extra- ordinary size, and are furnished by four principal Branches. The first is the Inferior Maxillary, or third portion of the Fifth Pair, and corresponds with that which, in the Back of a Sliate^ sends a very large Nerve to the origin of the Mucous Ducts. The other Nerves are from the Eighth Pair, and go to the Elec- trical Organ after supplying the Gills. The whole of this remarkable substance is found to correspond in its effects with those of an Electrical Machine. The upper and under surfaces of the Ani- mal are in the jplus and minus states of Electricity, and the shock is given at the will of the Creature ; but dif- fers from that coming from an Electrical Apparatus, in producing neither light nor sound. The Electrical Organ, in a Gymnotus^ is more deve- loped than that of a Torpedo, It composes a great part of the thickness of the very large Tail, and ex- tends from within a little distance of the Head to the posterior extremity of the Animal. It is divided into four portions, called by Mr Hunter, Great and Small Organs. The Great Organs are placed above the Small

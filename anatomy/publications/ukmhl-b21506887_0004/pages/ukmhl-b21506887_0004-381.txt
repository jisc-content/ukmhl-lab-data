Part VIII.] OF WORMS. 37T the Larvae of Insects. A Ganglion representing the Brain is situated on the Head, and forms a Collar round the Esophagus, sending Nerves to the rest of the Body. In a Leech^ the Nervous System is a slender Cord, com- posed of numerous Ganglia. The first sends a Collar round the Esophagus ; the others send Nerves to the different parts of the Body. An Earth-worm has also a Ganglion or little Brain about the Esophagus, but no others in the rest of the Body. ' A Lumbricus Huma- nus has the appearance of a Collar about theEsophagus, a Cord along each side of the Body, and several Ganglia. Neither Eyes, Ears, nor Nose, have been discovered in Worms, yet they can select the nourishment proper for them. Circulating System,â€”Circulating Vessels are per- ceptible here, with distinct contraction and dilatation, but without any Heart, in some of the Animals of this class ; in others, they are wanting or invisible. The Blood in several Worms, is more or less of a reddish colour, and in some is as deep as in the higher classes of Animals. A great Vessel, in many, runs along the Back, and diminishes towards the Extremities. A Leech has a principal Vessel on each side, which communicates with the opposite one by many transverse Branches ; forming a Plexus on the Back, and another on tlie Belly. These are supposed by Naturalists to serve for Respiration, there being no evident Or- gan for this purpose. There is also a Vessel running along the Back, which appears to be an Artery. It gives Branches to the two sides, but whether the two sets of Vessels communicate, is not fully ascertained. An Earth-worm also has longitudinal Vessels filled

62 [Part I. OF THE MUSCLES. The others, which go across the Proboscis, contract both the surface of the Organ and the Canals it contains. They can at the same time elongate the whole of the Organ, or a particular part only. The longitudinal Fasciculi form four large Muscles, which occupy all the outer part of the Organ. They are divided by Tendinous Intersections, and take their origin behind from the Bones of the Face. They serve to shorten the whole or a part of it, and give that extraordinary power which the Animal possesses of moving the Snout in every direction. The Muscles pf the Mouth of Quadrupeds must vary according to the shape of the Lips. In a Dog, the Mouth is moved by six pair of Muscles and a Sphinc- ter, viz. the Levator and Depressor Labii Superioris Alasque Nasi, the former of which is principally used in snarling; the Levator and Depressor Labii Inferio- ris, the Buccinator, and Masseter. The five first are nearly as in Man ; the last has many of its Fibres spread out upon the Buccinator, in consequence of which they can forcibly raise the corners of the Mouth. The Mouth of a Horse is moved by the following Muscles, viz. the Levator Labii Superioris, which in this Animal is used in neighing, and in an Ass for braying; a Muscle termed Pyramidalis^ analogous to the Levator Labii Superioris and Levator Anguli Oris, arising from the fore part of the Superior Maxillary Bone at the Zygoma, and fixed to the Ala Nasi and Corner of the Mouth ; another Levator, termed Max- illaris, coming from the Forehead, and going obliquely outwards by two slips to the wing of the Nose and angle of the Mouth ; the large Zygomatic Muscle; the

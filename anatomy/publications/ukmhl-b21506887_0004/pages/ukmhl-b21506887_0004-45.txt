Part I.] OF MAMMALIA. 41 hind, but communicating with the Temporal Fossae ;â€” in the Ossa Palati forming a considerable proportion of the inner part of the Orbits, and supplying the want of an Os Planum of the Ethmoid Bone. The Lower Jaw of Quadrupeds deviates particularly from that of man, in being destitute of a Chin, and is also longer in proportion to the Cranium. The Con- dyles are found to vary according to the nature of the Food the Animal has to manducate, and the strength of the Muscles fixed to the Jaw. In the Ferce^ they are sa locked in by the fore and back parts of their Articu- lar Cavities, that rotatory motion is entirely prevented ; the Jaw moving only in a vertical direction, which is all that is necessary for the tearing and cutting of Animal Substances. In many Herbivorous Animals they are rounded, for admitting motion in every direction, so as to adapt them for grinding the Food. In a great proportion of the Glires they are parallel to each other, and placed in a longitudinal direction, by which the Incisores of the Lower Jaw can move horizontally, and advance or recede upon those of the Upper Jaw, so as to break the hard substances upon which these Animals frequently live. In many of the Mammalia, as the FercB^ &c. the la- teral portions of the Jaw are connected by Cartilage for life ; but in the Ape tribe. Horned Cattle, &c. they are united into one piece. The most singular form of this Bone in a Quadruped, is that of the Duck-bill appearance which it has in the Ornithorrynchus.

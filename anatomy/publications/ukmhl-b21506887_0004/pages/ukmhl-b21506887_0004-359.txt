Part V.J OF MOLLtfSCA. 355 the Sexes have a common outlet, and another, as the Aplasia, where they have a separate exit. The first set have a Testicle, a Vas Deferens, a Penis, and a Ve- sicle with a long Neck. The Testicle is a long white granulated Body, which sends out the Vas Deferens that terminates in the Penis, and this ends in a fleshy Sac, which is the common Cavity of Generation. The Ovarium is composed of a cluster of Ova, situated be- tween the Liver and Intestines. From the Ovarium an Oviduct goes out, which, about the season of sexual intercourse, makes zig-zag turns, and is so connected to the Testicle, as to appear to receive liquor from it. It terminates in the common Cavity of Generation.' In time of copulation, the Snail tribe turn out the common Cavity, which then presents the three open- ings of the Penis, Oviduct, and Vesicle. The Penis penetrates the Oviduct of the other individual. The Eggs are observed to be produced a few days after- wards. The same circumstances, in general, take place among the other individuals. Of tjcasteropoda with Sexes separate, the Male of the Buccmum Undatiim is observed to have a Testicle, which, with the Liver, fills half of the deepest part of the Shell. The Vas Deferens forms numerous turns and goes to the Penis, which is of great size. It adheres to the right side of the Neck, and makes a fold in the Cavity of the Lungs. In a Female, the Oviduct is a great Canal at the right side of the Lungs, placed between the Body and Rectum. Acephala are found to be all Hermaphrodite. They fecundate themselves without copulation.

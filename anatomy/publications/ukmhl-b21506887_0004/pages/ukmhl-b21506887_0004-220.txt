S16 OF THE INTEGUMENTS [Part 11. Birds of Prey, they are strong, like those of Carnivo- rous Quadrupeds. In Gallinaceous Birds, there is a supernumerary Claw, the Spur, which the Animal uses in fighting, and in fixing upon the Female in discharging the Semen. The OrnitJiorrynchus has a Spur for the same purpose. In the former Animals, the Spur has one Bone in it, which is fixed to the Tarsus; in the latter Animal, it has two. But besides the use the Gallinaceous Birds make of their Spur, the Ornithorrynchus can employ it for a very different purpose. Near the posterior ex- tremity of the SpinCj and between the Integuments and Muscles over the Os Innominatum and Hip Joint, a Poiso7i-Gland, of the conglomerate kind, has lately been discovered, which sends out a large Duct that de- scends in the back part of the Limb, and opens into a Sac in the hollow of the Foot. From the Sac another Duct is sent out, which goes through the Spur, and terminates in its point. By this the Creature can con- vey the Poisonous Fluid secreted in the Gland, into the wound inflicted upon another Animal. Claws are wanting in the Wings of Birds, where they could notbeused, either forwalking, or seizing the prey. OF THE BRAIN, ^c. The Membranes of the Brain correspond, in number and general appearance, with those of the former class. In some Birds, there is even a Falx, and this, in a

40 OF THE BONES. [Part I. great measure, on the figure and extent of the Upper Jaw. Quadrupeds, the Ape tribe not excepted, have two Bones in the Face in addition to those found in Man. These contain the roots of the Dentes Incisores, when such are present, but exist also in Animals destitute of Teeth. They are termed Ossa Intermaocillaria, Ossa Incisoria, vel Labialia, and are situated between the Ossa Maxillaria ; but the Suture which separates these from the Maxillary Bones is obliterated in some Ani- mals at an early period of life. In an Ourang-outang, as well as in Mammalia in ge- neral, the Jaws are longer than in a Human Body. The Elongation is produced by the depth and situa- tion of the superior Maxillary Bones,, and increases in Quadrupeds in proportion as they recede from Man. When standing in the ordinary or horizontal posture, the Head of a Quadruped is supported by Muscles, and by the Ligamentum Nuchae, which in general be- comes stronger according to the weight of the Head. The prolongation of the Bones of the Face may be determined by the Facial Angle, which becomes more acute according to the length of the Face. The Face of the Ferce, and of several other Quadru-. peds, differs from that of an Ape^ in having the Nasal Processes of the superior Maxillary Bones broader, which removes the orbits to the sides of the Head;— ill the Orbitar Surface of these Bones not forming the under, but the anterior parts of the Orbits ;—in the Ossa Malarum not being articulated with the Os Fron- tis, nor Os Sphenoides, but only contributing to form the Zygomatic Arches and the inferior edges of the Or-, bits ;—in the Orbits not being inclosed below and be-

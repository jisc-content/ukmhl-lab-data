Part II.] OF BI^DS. goes to the Labyrinth by many Branches. The Eighth and Ninth pairs are dispersed as in Mammalia. The Great Sympathetic has organs, connexions, and terminations, which bear a considerable analogy to those of the Animals of the former class, varying only in some particulars. It passes through the same Foramen with the Pars Vaga and Glosso-pharyngeus. It unites with Nerves near it, has Ganglia in its course through the Body, and can be traced as far as the Vertebrae of the Tail. The Spinal Marrow is nearly of the same nature, and the Nerves are generally sent off from it by anterior and posterior bundles of Fibres, as in Mammalia. The Cervicals are analogous to those of the former class of Animals, but the number corresponds with that of the Vertebrae. They go chiefly to the Neck, only one or two of the last assisting in the formation of the Brachial Plexus. The Diaphragmatic Nerves^ like the Diaphragm it- self, are wanting. The Dorsals and Lumhars correspond with those, in Mammalia, and the number with that of the Verte- brae. The Brachial Plexus is chiefly formed by the last Cervical and two first Dorsals, and is large, having to supply the Pectoral Muscles of great size, which are inserted into the Wings. The Nerves of the Abdominal or Inferior Extremities are nearly as in Mammalia. The Anterior Crural \^ sent off from the three last Lumbars, from which also the Obturator comes. The Sciatic is chiefly formed by the four Superior or Anterior Pelvic Nerves, and di-

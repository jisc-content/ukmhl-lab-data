Part I.] OF MAMMALIA. 107 opening, to the Posterior Maxillary Sinuses. Among Pecora, there are scarcely any Frontal Sinuses in a Deer, while an Ox and Sheep have them of great ex- tent. In a Pig, also, they are very extensive ; but an Elephant has them the largest that are found in any Animal, if the Diploe, or Cells, already mentioned, can be regarded as such. They extend, in that Ani- mal, between the Tables of the Frontal, Parietal, and Temporal Bones, as far as the Occipital Condyles. A Rhinoceros and Hippopotamus have none. Ethmoid Cells,—In a number of Quadrupeds, these are distinct from the Superior Spongy Bones, and they are sometimes separated from the General Cavity of the Nose by a distinct partition. In the greater number of Animals, they vary considerably in their appearance from those in Man. They are sent down from the Cri- briform Plate of the Ethmoid Bone, in the form of hol- low Pedicles, and, extending in the Cavity of the Nose, the nearest, in proportion as they advance, unite with each other. They form little Caverns, which, as they increase in size, become less numerous, and communi- cate among themselves by diffel-ent passages. Carni- vorous Quadrupeds are found to have the greatest proportion of these Cells. Glires have but few, Ce- tacea none. Sphenoidal Sinuses,—These are the smallest in pro- portion in Quadrupeds; many want them, but they are of great extent in an Elephant, though not Cellular, like the other Sinuses of this Animal. Maxillary Sinuses.—In the Ape tribe, these are pro- portionally smaller than in Man. They are diminutive in most of the Glires and Carnivora, and, in general^

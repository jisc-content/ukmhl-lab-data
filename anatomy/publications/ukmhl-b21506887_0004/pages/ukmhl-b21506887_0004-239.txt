Part II.] OF BIRDS. 235 nical, at other times it has dilatations and contractions, as in some of the Swimming Birds. The Rings of the Trachea have no visible Fleshy Fibres, but only Membranes fixing them together; though in larger Birds, as a Cassotvary and Ostrich^ they are observed to be covered with transverse Mus- cular Fibres, from which it is presumed that, however delicate, they exist in all. The length of the Trachea varies in different Birds with that of the Neck. It sometimes differs in the two sexes of the same species, especially in Birds of the A- quatic kind, as is observed in a Male Wild Swan, a Crane, and Indian Cock. In these, the Trachea makes large convolutions, partly without and partly within the Cavity of the Thorax, before entering the Lungs ; yet there are no such turns in the Trachea of a Herron, Stork, Bittern, &c.; these, however, are not properly Diving, but Wading Birds. The use ascribed to this structure is, to retain the inspired air, and thus furnish a sufficient supply of Oxygen to the Animal while diving in deep water in search of prey, or flying in rarified air. These Convolutions have been compared to the wind- ings of a French Horn, and Birds possessing such a Trachea are said to be fine singers. But this has been doubted, more especially as such a structure is not found in Singing Birds. The under end of the Trachea, or Inferior Glottis, or Vocal Organ, is formed of tense Membranes, and appears like the reed of a musical pipe. It is contract- ed into a narrow chink, and divided into two openings by a slender slip of Bone, which goes from before back-

The one, termed Quadratus, has its origin from above ; the other, called Pyramidalis, comes from below, and forms a Tendinous Cord, that runs through an Aponeurotic Sheath formed by the first, then in Cellular Substance at the under part of the Sclerotica, to be fixed to the inferior and exterior edge of the Membrana Nictitans. After the Membrane has been drawn to the outer cor- ner of the Eye, it is returned by its own elasticity. The Lacrymal Gland, in Birds, is commonly small. It is situated at the outer angle^ and sends out the Tears in some, as a Common Fowl, by one, and in others, by two or three small Canals, through the Up- per Eye-lid. The Glandula Harderi is also found here ; it is of a fleshy colour, and considerably larger than the Lacry- mal Gland. It is commonly placed between the Le- vator and Adductor Oculi, and discharges, by a single Duct, a yellowish fluid upon the inner surface of the third Palpebra. In the Duck tribe and Water Birds, there is a large Glandular Body in the upper part of the Orbit, which seems to supply the place of the Lacrymal Gland, yet no duct has been traced from it. All Birds have two Buncta Lacrymalia, but no Ca- runcula Lacrymalis, The passages from the Puncta terminate in the Nasal Sac, situated in tlie Palate, at the Base of the Nose. The Sclerotic Coat forms little more than a hemi- sphere in this class, and to its anterior flat part is at-

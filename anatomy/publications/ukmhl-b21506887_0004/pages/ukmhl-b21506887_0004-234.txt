230 . OF THE MOUTH, &c. [Paut II. two pairs of very long Crura. The Body, when in a state of rest, is placed in a fleshy sheath of the Bill. Two of the Crura lie in the Neck, the other two are connected to the former, then proceed completely over the Cranium, running under the Integuments, to be fixed to the Upper Jaw. By means of this apparatus acting like a spring, the Tongue can be thrust some inches out of the Mouth. The Salivary Glands, in Birds, exist only under the Tongue, where they occupy the place of the Sub- lingual in Mammalia. They form a mass of small Granulous Bodies on each side, from which a liquor, somewhat viscid, flows into the Mouth by numerous orifices. In GalUnacea, they are of considerable size. Two pairs are found in a Turkey, the first lying concealed immediately under the Skin, the second on the poste- rior portion of the first. Their colour is yellowish like the humour which they secrete. In a Par roquet, the liquor of these Glands is viscid and grey. In a Wood- pecher, the Salivary Gland extends as far as the Occi- put, is of a white colour, and sends out a single Duct, which terminates under the point of the Tongue, dis- charging a white Fluid into the Mouth. Water Birds in general have but one pair of Glands, which secrete a white and viscid humour, discharged by many orifices ; but in some of the Birds of this order, as a Gull, the Salivary Glands have only a single Duct.

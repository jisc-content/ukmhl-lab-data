70 OF THE MUSCLES. [Part I. Apes and many other clawed Animals, to that in Man. In Solipeds and Ruminants^ it is fixed to the base of the Metacarpal Bone, and forms the Oblique Extensor of the Canon Bone. The Extensor Primi Internodii is present in Apes^ Dogs, Cats, &c. The Extensor Secundi Internodii Pollicis is indistinct in Apes, and wanting in Dogs, Cats, &c. In Solipeds and Ruminants, the two last- named Muscles are wanting. The Flexors of the Thumb, in clawed Quadrupeds, are somewhat similar to those in Man. In Ruminants, the Muscles analogous to the Flexor Sublimis and Flexor Profundus of the Fingers send each two Ten- dons to the Fore-Toes. In Solipeds, there are two similar Muscles, but only a single Tendon to each, the one also perforating the other. MUSCLES OF THE POSTERIOR EXTRE- MITIES. Muscles of the Thigh.â€”In the generality of Qua- drupeds, the Gluteus Medius and Minimus are large. In a Horse, the Muscle corresponding to the Maxi- mus in Man is the smallest of the three, and is almost Aponeurotic. The Medius in that Animal is the Muscle principally used in kicking. In a Bear, however, the Gluteus Maximus is so large, compared with the other Muscles, as to enable the Animal frequently to put itself into the upright posture. The Iliacus Internus and Psoas Magnus are general- ly in proportioii much longer than in Man, correspond-

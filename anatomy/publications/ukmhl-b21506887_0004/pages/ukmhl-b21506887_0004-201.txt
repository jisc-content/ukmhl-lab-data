Part I.] OF MAMMALIA. 197 cording to the number of Foetuses which the Animal produces at a time. In Uniparous Animals, they are generally situated between the Hind Legs. In the Mul- tiparous, they extend, in some along the Abdomen, and in others, also along the Thorax. The Mamma is surrounded with less Fat in proportion than in Wo- men ; hence not bulky, till distended with Milk. The situation and number of the Teats projecting from the Mamma vary much. In general, though with many exceptions, the number is about twice that of the Foetuses which the Animal commonly produces at a Birth, to give, along with the extended Mamma, an op- portunity for suckling all the young at the same time. The Teat is commonly hollow within ; the Cavity communicating with two reservoirs, in which the Lac- tiferous Tubes terminate. It has only one or two ori- fices externally. Of the number of the Teats in Mammalia, there are generally, Two Inguinal in a SJieep^ Goat, Mare, and Cetacea, Four Inguinal in a Cow, Deer, and Camel, Four Abdominal, in a Lioness and Panther. Ten Abdominal in a Sow. Six abdominal, and Four Pectoral, in a Bitch, Hare, and Rabbit. Four Abdominal, and Four Pectoral, in a Cat. Eight Abdominal, and from Two to Four Pectoral, in a Rat. Two Abdominal, and four pectoral, in a Bear. Four Abdominal, and Six Pectoral, in a Hedge-hog. Two Pectoral in an Ape, Bat, and Elephant. The Nipples are sometimes found, but in smaller

The two Laminae of which this Membrane is composed, are separated at the large end, and leave between them a cavity filled with Atmospheric Air, the Folliculus Aeris, which is larger in an Egg kept for some time than in one recent- ly laid. The Membrana AIbuminis incloses the Glaire of the Egg, which is separated into an outer and inner por- , tion ; the inner, as well as the outer, is surrounded by a Membrane, delicate and very dense, and yet allowing the Glaire to transpire when the Egg is long kept, es- pecially in a warm atmosphere. The outer Glaire, tvhich is more fluid and transparent than the inner, can

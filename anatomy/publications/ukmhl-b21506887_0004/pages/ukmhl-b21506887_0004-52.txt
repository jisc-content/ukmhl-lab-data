[Part I. OF THE BONES. 48 broad behind as before, and are hollow externally. In a Mole, the Ossa Innominata are almost cylindrical, and so close together, that the Parts of Generation are situated on the Abdominal side of the Brim of the Pel- vis. A Bear, which rests much on its Buttocks, has the Pelvis more similar to that in man, than in many others. In an Otter and Seal, it is similar to that of other Carnivora. In Solipeds, the Ossa Ilia are large, and the Ossa Ischia short. The Acetabula, as in many other Qua- drupeds, correspond with the posterior third part of the length of the Ossa Innominata. The Symphysis Pubis is remarkable for its length; and, in old Ani^ mals, is frequently Anchylosed. In the larger Ruminants, as an Ox, the Ilia are of great breadth. In the more diminutive species, they are proportionally smaller. The external surface is concave. Among Belluoe, the Pelvis of a Pig is similar to that of the Ferae, but the Ossa Ischia go farther back, and the Notches of the Ilia extend farther into the Bones. An Elephant and Rhinoceros have broad Ossa Ilia ; the Abdominal Surface is concave, the Pel- vis is of enormous size, and the Symphysis Pubis of great length. The Cetacea have no Pelvis, except two thin flat Bones, suspended in the flesh of the back part of the Belly, and side of the Anus, and somewhat analogous to the Ossa Pubis. The Thorax oi Animals without Clavicles is common- ly compressed externally, or is deeper from Spine to

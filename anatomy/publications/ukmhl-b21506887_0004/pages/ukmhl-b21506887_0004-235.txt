OF BIRDS. Part II ] OF THE HEART AND BLOOD- VESSELS. The Heart corresponds in its principal parts with that in Mammalia. It has four cavities, which have the same general appearance, and transmit the Blood in the same manner. It is of a conical form, but the cone varies in length or in roundness in different Birds. The situation is nearly the same as in Mammalia, but nearer the anterior part of the Thorax. The Pericardium is covered by the Membrane form- ed by the Pleura and Peritoneum. The Auricles have no Appendices externally. The Ventricles have Columnse Carneae in proportion to their thickness and strength. The Valve corresponding with the Tricuspid in Mammalia, is peculiar, in being form- ed of a strong fleshy flap, while the other Valves re- semble those in the former class. In an Ornitliorryn- chus, this Valve is more analogous to that in Birds than in Mammalia. The Pulmonary Artery is proportionally small, the Lungs occupying less space. The Aorta divides near its origin in to three smaller Aortse. The right forms the Posterior or Descending Aorta, the other two form the Subclavian Arteries. The Suhclavians give ofl* the Carotids, Vertebrals, Branches to the Neck and Thorax, then divide into liadial and Ulnar, which are dispersed on the Wings.

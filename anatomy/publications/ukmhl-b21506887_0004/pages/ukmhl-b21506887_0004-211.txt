Part II.] OF BIRDS: m in the Lower extremities, there is an Os Femoris, a Tibia and a Fibula, which is soon anchylosed to the Tibia, and does not reach its Lower Extremity ; a Ro- tula, the place of which is often supplied by a Process of the Tibia, as in Diving Birds; one Bone supplying the place of Tarsus and Metatarsus; and the Toes, the Bones of which are more numerous, the more ex- teriorly they are placed. The Toes are articulated upon a Pulley, formed by the lower end of the Meta- tarsal Bone. The inner side has a small Bone, that supports the posterior Toe or Pollex. There are two Bones to the Pollex, three to the Second Toe, four to the third Toe, and five to the Fourth. In Birds with only three Toes, the First Toe has three, the Second four, and the Third Toe five Bones. A Cassowary has only three Toes, and an Ostrich two. Birds with four Toes have commonly three before, and one behind. Some, as a Parrot, Cuckoo, &c. have two be- fore and two behind. Swimming Birds, 6(,s a Penguin^ have the Pollex obliterated. In wading and other long-limbed Birds, the length of the Leg is produced by the Tibia, and the Bone which supplies the place of Tarsus and Metatarsus ; and is often in proportion to that of the Neck, though there are many exceptions. The Lower Extremities of Birds in general, are placed so much behind the common centre of gravity, as to make the Animal appear to be in danger of fall- ing forward in walking; but this is prevented by the Angle formed between the Leg and Body, and by the elevation of the Head and Neck.

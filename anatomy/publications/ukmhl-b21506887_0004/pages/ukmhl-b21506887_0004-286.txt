The Right Aorta furnishes the Aorta Anterior, that soon divides into two Branches, of which, one is the common Carotid, the other is the Subclavian. /-t, . The Carotids are dispersed like those in Mammalia. The Subclavians are also nearly as in Man. Lizards.—In a Crocodile, there are three principal Arteries, each with two Semilunar Valves. 1. The Pulmonary Artery on the left side. 2. The Aorta Posterior Sinistra. 3. The Aorta Posterior Dextra. The three Arteries are joined together for some lengthy as in the former order.

Frog and Salamander.-—The Aorta soon divides into two Branches; each of these produces a Pulmo- nary, a Carotid, and Subclavian, and Arteries similar to the Intercostals, then turns back, and unites with its fellow. The Trunk resulting furnishes the Coeliac and other Arteries, which generally com-e off from the Abdominal Aorta. Veins. The Turtle tribe have two posterior Cavas, which, after passing the anterior part of the Liver, are each joined by an Anterior Cava of the same side, formed by the common Trunk of the Jugular and Subclavian Veins.

Part I.] OF MAMMALIA. 121 In the generality of Quadrupeds, the Esophagus is distinguished from that in Man, by two rows of Mus- cular Fibres decussating each other, and running in a spiral but opposite direction. On this. Rumination is commonly explained, though the same structure exists in different Carnivorous Animals which do not rumi- nate, as a Dog, Cat, Bear, he. but in ruminating Animals, the Coats of the Esophagus are remarkably strong. Many Plicae are formed upon the inner surface of the Esophagus, which, as in Man, are most evident when it is most contracted. There are also many Fol- licles here, from which a Humour is plentifully sup- plied. Of the Teeth. All Mammiferous Animals have Teeth in their Jaws, with a few exceptions, as the American Ant-eaters, Scaly Lizards, and the proper Whales. Besides the Teeth proper for mastication, some, as a Dog, Lion, Tiger, &c. have Canine Teeth, serving partly as of- fensive weapons, and partly to enable the Animal to lay hold of and lacerate its prey.

Part I.] OF MAMMALIA. 177 OF THE MALE ORGANS OF GENERATION. Testes.â€”The Testes are found in all Male Animals, except in those of the very lowest orders. In the diffe- rent Mammalia, as in Man, they are two in number; but there is considerable variety in their situation and structure. In the Ape tribe, in most of the Carnivora, in Soli- peds, and in most Muminants, they are placed in a Scrotum, with a Cellular Partition between them. They are pendulous in such Animals as have Vesiculae Semi- nales, in which the Semen is readily conducted to the Penis. In a Kanguroo and Opossum^ they are placed at the fore part of the Pelvis, in a Scrotum without any partition. In Belluce, and a Civet, they are situated under the Skin of the Perineum. In an Otter and Camel, they lie under the Integuments of the Groin. In a Bat, Squirrel, Rat, Guinea Pig. Beaver, Por- cupine, Hedge-hog, Slirew, Mole, he. they pass from the Abdomen into the Scrotum, upon certain occasions* particularly at their seasons of sexual intercourse. VOL. IV. M

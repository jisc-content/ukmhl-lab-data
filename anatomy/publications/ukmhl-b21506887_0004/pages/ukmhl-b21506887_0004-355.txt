The other Mollusca have a simple Heart, consisting of an Auricle and a Ventricle. Gasteropoda^ as a Slug, Snail, Limpet, he. have each also one Auricle and one Ventricle. The Veins of the Body, upon approaching the Lung, change into a Pulmonary Artery, in the manner the Vena Portse Abdominalis changes into the Porta Hepa- tica ; the Pulmonary Veins go to the Auricle, and this to the Ventricle, which sends, by an Aorta, Branches to the different parts of the Body. The Pulmonary System here is situated in the vicinity of the Rectum, by which the Vessels receive more readily the Veins of the Intestines. Acephalous Mollusca, as a Muscle, and different Conchce Bivalves Equivalves, have the Heart near the Rectum. The Auricle receives the Blood from the Branchiae, and sends it to the Ventricle, whence it is transmitted to the Body. Organs of Respiration.â€”These consist of Branchiae, which are either concealed or exposed. Cephalopoda and AcepJiala have them shut; Gasteropoda have them in diff(erent situations. In a Cuttle-Fisli, the Lungs form two Conical Bodies, lying on each side of the Sheath which incloses the Viscera of the Abdomen. A Slu^ and Snail, among Gasteropoda, have a Cavity in the Neck, which supplies the place of a Lung, and has the Pulmonary Vessels dispersed upon its furface. The Lung, in these Animals, terminates by a small orifice on the surface of the Body, which can be opened or shut at pleasure, and the Lung dilating

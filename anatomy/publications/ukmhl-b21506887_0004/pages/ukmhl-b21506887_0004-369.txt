Part VII.] OF INSECTS. , 365 cheon. The Pectus contains the Muscles which move the Wings and four pair of Feet. Abdomen,—It commonly consists of different Rings. In some, it is directly continued from the Breast; in others, there is an evident contraction between them^ and a real Joint connected by Ligaments. Sometimes the Abdomen is terminated by a Sting, by Bristles, Plates, &c. Members or Feet, and Wings,—In winged Insects, the number of the Feet is generally six, never less, but frequently more; Scorpions, Spiders, &c. have eight ; Millipedes and Scolopendra, or Centipedes, have them attached to every ring of the Body. The feet consist of the Goxa or Haunch, the Femur or Thigh, the Ti- bia or Leg, the Tarsus or Toe. Each of these is in- closed in a horny case, and moves as on a hinge. The Toe consists, in general, of several Joints, the last of which is terminated by one or two crooked Claws. The articulations vary according to the mode of life. They are slender in many which burrow in the earth, as in a Scaraboeus. They are like Fans, and ciliated on the sides in those that swim, as in a Hydrophilus, or Diver. They have Viscous Balls, bristly Tufts, &c. in such as walk in smooth and slippery parts, as in a common Fly. In Insects that crawl upon Hairs, there are two moveable and opposite Claws, as in Lice, &c. Each of the Joints of the Feet is furnished with an Extensor and a Flexor Muscle, inclosed in the preced- ing Joint. The Wings are attached to the Pectus, as already ob- served. The greater number of Insects have four, some

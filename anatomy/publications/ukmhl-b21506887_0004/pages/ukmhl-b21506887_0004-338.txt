334 OF THE AIK-BAG [Part IV. By the contraction of the Air-bag, whether by the action of its own Coats, or by the Lateral Muscles of the Body, the contained Air is considered to be con- densed, by which the Animal can sink ; or, by a relax- ation of these parts, the Bag can be dilated, so as to allow the Fish to rise again at pleasure. The internal surface of the Air-bag is commonly uniform, but some- times divided by Septa, as in a Sdurus^ or Cellular, as in a Porcupine Fish. Its sides also vary much in thickness and strength in different Fishes. Upon the inner side of this Sac, in the different Species of Gadiis, as Cod, Haddock, &c. a Gland is situated, which has a lobulated structure ; and in an Eel, there are two, from which the contained Air is supposed to be secreted. In a Sea Perch, there is also a Gland, but, besides this, there are two others on the outside of the Bag, from which numerous Vessels containing Air arise, and unite into a Trunk that opens into the Sac. In other Fishes, no similar Or- gans are found, but Vessels are observed on the inside of the Sac, which seem to secrete Air to answer the same purpose. The Air-bag generally communicates by one, and sometimes by more Ducts of various lengths, with the middle part of the Esophagus, or of the Stomach, though more frequently with the former. Sometimes, as in a Herring, it ends in the bottom of the Stomach. In some, as a Sturgeon, it communicates with the Sto- mach without the intervention of a Tube ; and here, as also in a Salmon, there is a Sphincter Muscle, which may act as a Valve. Where a Sphincter is not found, the Muscular Fibrcf^ of the Organ in which the

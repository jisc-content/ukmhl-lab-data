Part II.] QF BIRDS. 217 Wood-cocJc and Ornithorrynchus^ is of an Osseous na- ture. The proportional size of the Brain of the Animals of this class varies extremely; but it is found, that the Brain of the smaller Birds bears a greater proportion to the size of the Body, than that of the larger kinds. While, in a Sparrow^ it is a 25th, and in a Goldfinch, a 14th of the weight of their Body ; in Eagle, it is on- ly a 160th, and in a Goose, a 360th. The Brain consists of two large masses, which form the Hemispheres, the two Thalami Optici, the Cere- bellum, and Medulla Oblongata. The Hemispheres are in form of a Heart, with the base turned backward. There are no Convolutions, nor Corpus Callosum, nor Fornix, nor Septum Luci- dum. The Corpora Striata are of uniform colour in- ternally. The Thalami are two roundish Tubercles lying un- der the Hemispheres, without being inclosed by them. Between the Thalami and Corpora Striata are common- ly four Eminences, which do not appear in Man. The Lateral Ventricles do not turn down behind to form the inferior Cornua; of course, the Cornua Ammonis are absent. The Lateral Ventricles, in Birds, are distin- guished from those of all other Animals, by the radiated partition which separates them from each other. They communicate with each other, and with the Third Ven- tricle. The Third Ventricle is situated between the Thalami, and communicates with the Infundibulum, and also with the Fourth Ventricle; but the passage into this last is only covered by a thin Lamina, the Tubercula

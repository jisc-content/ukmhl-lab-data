Part IV.] OF FISHES. S15 but in a Shate^ Shark, &c. the bottom of the eye is of a silver colour, from the Choroid Coat appearing through its inner lining, which is here transparent. The outer Layer of the Choroides, or proper Cho- roid coat, is white or argent, and Vascular. From the inner Layer, a Vascular Funnel-shaped Membrane arises, the Campanula of Haller, which goes to the Lens, and has been considered as analogous to the Marsupium of Birds. Between the two Layers of the Choroid Coat, in Osseous Fishes, but not in the Skate and Shark kind, there is a Body, termed Corpus Glandulosum, or Glan- dula Choroidea, of a brilliant red colour. It is in form of a Horse-shoe, or, in some, approaches to a circle. It is considered either as Muscular, and serving to make the Eye accommodate itself to objects at different dis- tances, or Glandular, and secreting some of the Hu- mours. The Corpus Ciliare is indistinct, and Ciliary Pro- cesses are generally wanting in Fishes. The Iris is intimately connected with the Choroid Coat, and possesses brilliant colours in different Fishes. In a Skate, the upper part of the Iris has a palmat- ed Process or Curtain, termed Operculum Pupillare, which the Animal occasionally lets down to cover the Pupil. ^ Of the Humours of the Eye, the Aqueous is so small in quantity, as to be seen with difficulty, the deficiency being supplied by a spherical Lens, and the denser ele- ment in which the Animal lives. The Lens is, besides,* observed to be not only rounder, but also more dense than in Land Animals, the more completely to refract

280 OF THE HEART, &c. [Part III. many Reptiles, the Auricles are proportionally much larger than in the two preceding classes. The Colum- nae Carneae are less raised. The Right Auricle receives the Blood from the Body, the Left from the Lungs. The Ventricles have Cavities small in proportion to their external appearance, owing to the great thickness of their walls. Internally they have, in the three first orders or tribes, numerous Columnae Carneae. In the Turtle kind, there is a strong Pericardium, united to the Peritoneum, in the manner the Dia- phragm is united to the Pericardium in a Human Body. The two Auricles are separated by a complete partition. The two Cavss terminate in the Right Auricle, where there are two Valves, and the Pulmo- nary Veins in the Left, where there are also a pair of Valves. Each Auricle communicates with a corre-, sponding Ventricle. The two Ventricles communicate by a large opening. In the Right Ventricle, there is a hollow Muscular Valve, which prevents the return of the Blood to the Left. The Arteries arise from the Right Ventricle only. They come off in three large Trunks, or there are three Aortae, two of which go to the Abdomen. The Right is the proper Abdominal Aorta ; the Left, the Ductus Communicativus of Mery; and Third, the Pulmonary Artery. In consequence of this structure, the Aortic Circula- tion can proceed without interruption while the Animal is under water, which is different from what happens in the two former classes. In the Lizard tribe, the Pericardium adheres, as in a Tortoise, to the Peritoneum, which covers the con-

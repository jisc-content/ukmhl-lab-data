Part I.J OF MAMMALIA. 69 Muscles of the Hand.—Apes have Supinators similar to those in Man. A Dog and Cat have the Supina- tor Brevis, but the Longus is wanting. They are both wanting in Solipeds, Ruminants, and Belluce. The Pronators are the same in Apes and Carnivora as in Man. Solipeds and Ruminants have no Pronators. The number of Flexors and Extensors of the Hand is nearly the same as in MonTieys, and other clawed Qua- drupeds, as in Man. In Quadrupeds with a Canon Bone, the Extensor Carpi Radialis is inserted into the fore part of the Base of that Bone, which it extends ; and the Flexor Carpi Radialis is inserted into the back part of the Base. The Flexor Ulnaris and Extensor Ulnaris are fixed to the Bone that corresponds to the Os Pisiforme. The three last Muscles are Flexors in these Animals. Muscles of the Fingers.—The Extensor Digitorum Communis, in Quadrupeds with four Fingers or Fore- Toes independent of the Thumb, has four Tendons, in Ruminants two, in Solipeds only one. The Extensor Proprius Digiti Minimi in Monkeys^ sends Tendons to the fifth and fourth Fingers ; in Dogs and Bears, to the fifth, fourth, and middle Fingers. In Solipeds^ there are two Extensors fixed to the first Phalanx of the Fore-Toe. In Ruminants., this Muscle extends the Outer Toe, and the Extensor Indicis the Inner Toe. The Extensor Indicis Proprius, or Indicator, in Monkeys^ sends a Tendon to the fore, and another to the middle Finger. In Dogs and Cats., it is situated as in Man. In Solipeds and Ruminants, it is wanting. The Extensor Ossis Metacarpi Pollicis is similar, in

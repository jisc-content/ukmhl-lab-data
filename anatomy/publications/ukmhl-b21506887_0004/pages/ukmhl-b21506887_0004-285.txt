The Auricles are in general si- milar to those of a Tortoise^ but the Ventricle is ob- served to vary much in certain Genera and Species of this order. In others, particularly in a Crocodile, it is more complex, being formed into three apartments, which have numerous orifices in their partitions, and these receive the Blood from the Right and Left Au- ricles, as in a Tortoise^ where also Valves are placed to prevent its return. From the different apartments the three great Arteries go out, viz. the Right and Left Aortae, and Pulmonary Artery. In Serpents, the Heart is more simple than in a Crocodile; there are two Auricles and a Ventricle, with two apartments, and a large communication, or the Heart here resembles, in structure, that of a Tor- toise-, there are, within the Ventricle, also two Auri- cular Valves, and many Columnae Carnese; the for- mer preventing the return of the Blood to the Auri- cles, the latter mixing the Blood from the Lungs, and that from the rest of the Body, intimately together. Principal Blood-Vessels. * Tortoise.â€”From the Right Ventricle two or three large Arteries arise, which are joined together for a short space. The Pulmonary Artery arises on the left side, and soon divides into right and left Branches, which go to the corresponding Lungs. The Trunk of the Aorta commences at the right side of the base of the Heart, and immediately divides into the right and

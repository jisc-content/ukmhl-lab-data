Part HI.] OF REPTILES. 265 elongation and retraction; the Neck being bent, when retracted into the Shell, somewhat like a Z, though it can be moved in various directions when it protrudes from the Shell. The Muscles for these motions are numerous. Some pass from the under and fore part of the Back Shell to the Vertebrae of the Neck, and others from one set of Vertebrae to another. One Mus- cle is peculiar to this Animal, which arises from the^ first Dorsal Vertebra, and is fixed to the sixth and seventh Cervical Vertebrae. It begins the extension of the Neck, when the Head is concealed in the Shell. About half a dozen pairs of Muscles lie on the back part of the Neck, chiefly for raising the Head, or pull- ing it laterally. A few Muscles also appear below, particularly one supplying the place of the Sterno- mastoideus, for bending the Head, and producing a slight elevation of the Shoulder. The Muscles of the Shoulder are only three in num- ber, and are analogous to the Trapezius, Levator Sca- pulae, and Subclavius. The Muscles of the Humerus are more numerous than in other Animals, to give the necessary motions in swimming. They arise from the Bones of the Shoulder, and from the inner side of the Dorsal and Abdominal Shells. The Pectoralis Major is composed of several portions. There are something like two Deltoids. The other Muscles are analogous to the Latissimus Dorsi, Levator Brachii, Teres Major, and Biceps, The Muscles of the Fore-arm, and remaining part of the Anterior Extremity, are in a great measure A- poneurotic, the Member being in the form of a Fin, as in Cetacea. This is particularly the case in a Sea

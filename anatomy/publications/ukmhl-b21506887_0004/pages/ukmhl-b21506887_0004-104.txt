100 OF THE EAR. [Part I. ance, direction, and composition. Timid, and also nocturnal Animals, as a Hare^ Deer^ Bat, &c. are observed by Naturalists to have large Ears, to add to their acuteness of hearing, and enable them to guard against beasts of prey. The Concha is found to be turned backwards in those that flee, as a Hare, and forward in such as pursue, as a Lion, &c. Or in. some, the superior part of the Concha is turned down, as in a Spaniel, Sheep, Hog, Elephant, he. which en- ables them to hear sounds from below. Pendant Ears are considered by some Naturalists as marks of slavery. In a Bat, the Concha is so constructed, as to pre- vent the Air from rushing violently in while the Ani- mal is flying. The External Ear, in Quadrupeds, is more conical, and more uniform internally, than in Man. In all the class, excepting some of the Ape tribe, the outer bar of the Ear, or Helix, is wanting, the part being thin, and sharp on the edges ; and instead of an Antihelix, there is a transverse eminence, situated deep in the Ear. There is a Tragus, and Antitragus, the latter of which, in some Animals, as a Shrew, serves as an Operculum to the Ear. In Animals Avith very long and moveable Ears, the Muscles are much more numerous than in Man. In a Dog, Horse, Sheep, he. they are from a dozen to twenty in number to each Ear. Some arise from the Head, and are fixed to the part at the root of the Concha of the Ear, termed Scutum ; others come likewise from the Head, and are inserted into the Concha or Meatus Externus ; some pass from the Scutum to the Concha, and some from one part of the Concha to another. By means of these Muscles, the Animal can commonly move the Ear

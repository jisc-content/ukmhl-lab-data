[Part I, 86 OF THE BRAIN. The proportional breadth of the Brain to that of the Medulla Oblongata, is, with few exceptions, greater in Man than in other Mammalia. In Man^ it is as 7 to 1; in Apes^ from as 4 to 1 to as 5 to 1 ; in a Dog, as 11 to 6; in a Cat, as 11 to 4 ; in a Horse, as 21 to 8; in an Ox, as 13 to 5 ; in a Deer, as 5 to 2; in a Doh phin, as 13 to 1. The falx of the Dura Mater, in Mammalia, is smaller in proportion than in Man ; the Hemispheres being less in danger of injuring each other. It is of different breadths in different Animals. In a few individuals of the class, as an Ornitlwrrynclius and Porpoise, it is part- ly Osseous. The Tentorium in Quadrupeds is propor- tionally broader than in Man ; and in many, particu- larly Carnivora, it contains in its substance a plate of Bone. In the Cat and Bear kind, this plate is in one piece ; in a Horse, Dog, and Seal, in three. The Os- seous Tentorium is commonly considered as obviating the effects of concussion, though it is found in some Animals of slow, as well as in those of quick motion. The Falx Minor is wanting in Quadrupeds. The other two Membranes of the Brain are similar to those in the Human Species. The form of the Brain varies in different Animals. In the Ape tribe, it is oval, as in Man; in Carnivora, and some others, as a Hare and Babbit, it is narrower anteriorly ; others have the Cerebrum almost round. In a Dolphin, it is remarkable, in being twice as broad from one side to the other, as from before backwards. The Lobes of the Brain, particularly the Lateral, are not so prominent in other Animals as in Man, though there is a considerable variety here among different indi-

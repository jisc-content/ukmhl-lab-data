384 OF ZOOPHYTES. [Part IX. rent Mouth nor Stomach. They seem to be Gelati- nous masses, nourishing themselves by imbibing from their surface. Nervous System.—^No distinct Nervous System has yet been found in this class of Animals. In an Echinus, nothing has been seen which bears any resemblance to Nerves. In an Asterias are parts, something similar to them, round the Esophagus. There is a soft white circle, from which Filaments run to each of the Branches of the Animal, and also to the Stomach. Something of a similar nature is seen in a Holothuria. Between the different pairs of longitudi- nal Muscles,' a white cord appears, marked with the zig-zag lines seen in the Nerves of other Animals, and seeming also to encircle the Esophagus. No appearance of Nerves has been detected either in a Medusa or an Actinia. In a Hydra^ or Polypus with Arms, and also in Ani- mals the productions of infusion, there is nothing like Nerves, yet they are sensible of heat. They prefer light to darkness, and have so far the sensation of Touch, as to feel the agitation of the water that sur- rounds them. The different Organs of the Senses are not demon- strable here, though, as in the Vermes, Zoophytes are to be considered as possessing Senses adapted to their manner of living. , Vascular System.—In an Echinus, two Vessels run along the Intestines, one considered as an Aorta, the other a Vena Cava, but without any visible Heart. From these a Plexus runs off, to be distributed upon the Intestines and Mesentery. Something of the same kind is to be observed in an Asterias,

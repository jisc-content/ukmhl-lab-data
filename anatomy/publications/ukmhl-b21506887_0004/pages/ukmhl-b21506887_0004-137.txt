Part I.] OF MAMMALIA. 133 The Eustachian Valve is present in some Quadru- peds, and wanting in others. In Adult Quadrupeds, the Foramen Ovale is gene- rail j shut, as in Man. In Amphibious Mammalia, it is commonly shut, though found open occasionally. It is also shut in an OrnithorryncJius^ which has four Cavities to the Heart, as well as the Human Species. The Pulmonary Ventricle, in Mammalia, is gene- rally placed more on the right side of the Aortic Ven- tricle than in Man, and is so formed, that when the Heart is cut across, the section of the Left Ventricle is observed to form a circle, and the other an appendix to that circle. The proportional size of the Cavities of the Heart are found to be nearly the same as in Man; but in a Dolphin, the walls of the Right Ventricle are observed to be nearly as thick as those of the Left, and the Columnae Carneae corresponding. The Left Ventricle differs less in Mammalia from that in the Human Species than the Right. In some, the Columnae Carneae are more slender than in Man ; in others, less in number; and in a few, the inner side of the Ventricles is almost smooth. The Tricuspid Valve varies in the number of Columns fixing it to the sides of the Ventricle. In some it has three, as in Man ; in others, four ; in some, only two. The Mi- tral Valve, in a Lion, Ox, and Sheep, forms large Monticuli, which fix it to the walls of the Ventricle. The Semilunar Valves have nothing remarkable in them ; their strength corresponds with the strength and size of the Arteries to which they belong. The Pulmonary Artery differs from that in Man

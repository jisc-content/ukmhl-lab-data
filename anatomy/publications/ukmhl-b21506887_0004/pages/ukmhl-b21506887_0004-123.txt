Paet I.] OF MAMMALIA, 119 which is narrow and very long, is placed on the outer side of the Submaxillary, extending from the angle of the Jaw to the Anterior Sublingual, and sends out a single Duct, which terminates at a little distance from the end of the Submaxillary Duct. The Ante- rior Gland perforates the Mouth by several openings in a range. In CetaceUy the Salivary Glands appear to be want-» ing. Foramen Incisivum, vel Ductus Incisivus.—This ap- pears in all Quadrupeds, but varies considerably in size in different Genera. In an Ape, it is single below, but opens into each Nostril above. In Carnivora, So- lipeds, Ruminants, &c. it is double, and forms a com- munication between the Mouth and each Nostril, by which fluids pass from one cavity to the other. Throat. Velum Palati.—This, in Quadrupeds, is in general similar to that in Man, only it is proportionally larger. Except in an Ape, it does not send out any prolonga- tion in the form of the Uvula. In an Elephant, it de- scends under the Epiglottis, in consequence of which, liquors pumped up can be received from the Proboscis without getting into the Larynx. In Cetacea, the Velum is changed into a Canal, by which the Posterior Nares are prolonged about the pyramid of the Larynx, and their posterior part con- tinued with the Pharynx. Pharynx,—The Pharynx, in Mammalia in general, has nearly the same structure as in Man, but stronger

In a Bear^ Lion, &c. the Stomach is divided by a slight contraction at its middle, into two portions. In the former, the Esophagus enters directly at the end of the Stomach. A Cat has a single Pyramidal Sto- mach. Among Amphibious Animals, as a Seal^ some have a single Stomach, with the Esophagus entering directly at its extremity.

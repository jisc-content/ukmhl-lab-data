Part IV.] OF FISHES. 303 generally fixed to a Bony substance, which is the only thing analogous to the Scapula, and which is articulated with the upper and back part of the Cranium. In the Skate kind, they are fixed to the Vertebrae, and give to these Animals a rhoraboidal form. In Osseous Fishes, the Pectoral Fins form an angle with the Body, and move horizontally backwards and forwards ; but in a Raja, Squalus, &c. they are in the same horizontal plane with the Body, and move less or more in a ver- tical direction. The Abdominal Fins are connected to Bones, which may be compared to the Ossa Innominata, as the Pec- toral are to the Scapulae. Besides the Bones mentioned above, some Fishes possess Bones which are placed among the Muscles, and have the name of Ossicula Musculoricm Artedi. OF THE MUSCLES. The Muscles of Fishes are distinguished from those of the Animals of the former classes, by receiving less Blood, of course being paler in their colour, and by being more uniformly disposed into Layers, and, in general, by wanting Tendons. In Osseous Fishes, the greater part of the Muscles are placed upon the lateral parts of the Body, by which they enable the Animal to move readily to either side

The Panniculus Carnosus exists also in a Dolphin, Muscles of the Eye and Ear.—They will be noticed afterwards in the descriptions of these Organs. Muscles of the Nose and Mouth.—In Apes, the Nose is affected by a continuation of the Panniculus Carno- sus. In Carnivora, as a Dog, the Nose is moved by the Levator Labii Superioris Alaeque Nasi, that covers the Cheek, and the Depressor Alae Nasi, which is small. In Animals with projecting moveable Snouts, as a Bear and a Mole, the Cartilaginous Tube of the Nose is moveable in every direction on the end of the Osseous Snout, by several Muscles. In a Mole and

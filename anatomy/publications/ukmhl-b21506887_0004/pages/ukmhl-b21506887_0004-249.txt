Part II.] OF BIRDS. The Gut hangs loose, in a common Fowl, towards the right side of the Abdomen, the rest of the small In- testines making turns, and uniting themselves to each other. The Intestines are destitute of Valvulae Conni- ventes in Birds in general; but in many, there is a Villous appearance in them. There are commonly two Intestina Cceca in Birds, a few of the Aquatic kind excepted, which have only one. The CiEca are inserted at the sides of the termination of the Ilium. They are generally smaller at the base, and enlarge towards their shut extremities. They lie parallel to the small Guts, and contain the same kind of Aliment with them. In Carnivorous and Omnivo- rous Birds, they are commonly long, and of consider- able diameter. In nocturnal Birds of prey, they are in general very large ; but in diurnal Birds of prey, they are wanting, or of inconsiderable size. There are many exceptions to the above rules. In an Ostrich, the Caeca are remarkable for their spiral Valves. From the end of the Ilium, and also from the Caeca, when present, the Colon is sent off, which is proportion- ally short, and differs from that in many of the indivi- duals of the former class, in not being formed into Cells. In an Ostrich, however, the Colon, as it advanced, becomes tacked up into Cells, and gradually increases in diameter, contrary to what happens in other Animals. The Intestines are fixed to the Body by the Mesen^ tery, which arises from the Spine opposite to the Ante- rior Mesenteric Artery. It is of considerable breadth where it is attached to the small Intestine ; but what belongs to the Colon is narrow, this Gut being more firmly fixed than the rest.

170 OF THE PANCREAS. [Part I. In an Ourang-outang^ it is of the same figure as in Man. In the other Quadrupeds, it is less or more di- vided. There is commonly but one Pancreatic Duct; it seldom happens that any Branch goes off from it to terminate separately in the Duodenum. For the most part, the Pancreatic and Biliary Ducts have a common opening. Of Apes, some have the Ducts united ; in others, and also in a. Hare, Porcu- pine, and Hog, they terminate at a distance. In a Dog, one Pancreatic Duct goes into the Ductus Com- munis, and another into the Intestine. In a Cat, it ter- minates in one of the Cells of the Ampulla in the Ductus Communis. In most of the other Carnivora, the Pan- creatic and Biliary Ducts are generally united. In a Horse, they terminate separately, though near each other. In Ruminants, they commonly unite at their termination. In a Pig, the Pancreatic Duct ends at a great distance from the Ductus Communis. In an Elephant, as in a Cat, it opens into one of the Cells of the Ampulla in the Ductus Communis. Spleen. The Spleen is found not only in all Mammalia, but in most Vertebral Animals, and is observed to diminish in the proportional size from Quadrupeds down to Fishes. There is only one Spleen in Quadrupeds, but in a Dolphin and Porpoise, there are several of unequal magnitude, but so small, that if taken collectively, they would not equal the size of the Spleen in Quadrupeds. The colour is commonly of a deeper red than in Man,

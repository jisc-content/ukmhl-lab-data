P ART I.] OF MAMMALIA. Ill Pores, from which a Mucus constantly exudes, to keep the parts moist. The Blood-vessels are from similar Trunks with those in Man. The Nerves arise from the first and fifth pairs also, as in a Human Body. The Olfactory Nerves pene- trate the Ethmoid Bone by Fibrillae, corresponding in number and size to the Foramina in the Cribriform Plate, and are dispersed upon the Mucous Membrane covering the Cells and Anterior Conchas of this Bone, and upon the partition of the Nose. Some of these are soft and pulpy; others, as in an Ox and Sheep^ can be readily traced. The Branches of the fifth pair be- longing to the Nose, are from the Ophthalmic and Su- perior Maxillary Portions. Of the first, some minute Branches penetrate the Superior Orbitar Plate, to be dispersed upon the Membrane lining the Frontal Si- nuses ; others go to the Nose, re-enter the Cranium, and return to the Pituitary Membrane, as in Man. The superior Maxillary Nerve supplies the inferior-poste- rior parts of the Nose, and sends Twigs to the Maxil- lary Sinuses much after the same manner as in the Hu- man Species, allowance always being made for the size and form of the Organ in different Animals. Trunk and Proboscis of an Elephani.â€”This very singular Organ is extended into a long Fleshy sub- stance of a conical form, fixed by its base to the Fron- tal and Intermaxillary Bones. It contains two Tubes which are placed a little before its axis, and these form the prolongations and external openings of the Nose. The Tubes are nearly cylindri- cal, but contracted at their extremities, particularly next

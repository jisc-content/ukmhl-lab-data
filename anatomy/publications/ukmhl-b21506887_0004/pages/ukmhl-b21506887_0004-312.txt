308 OF THE BRAIN, &c. [Part IV. The Brain, in Fishes, somewhat resembles that in Birds, only the posterior bear a greater proportion to the anterior parts, and there is often a Tubercle behind, forming a kind of second Cerebellum, and which is pe- culiar to Fishes. The Brain, in general, is divided into Cerebrum and Cerebellum, and these have their Ventricles somewhat as in Mammalia. The Lobes are more numerous than in the former class, but there is a great variety in dif- ferent Fishes. The Cerebrum constantly forms two Lobes or Hemi- spheres, which are laid by the sides of each other, and are smooth and without convolutions. The Cerebellum is in one Lobe, and larger in proportion than the Hemi- spheres, often surpassing them in size. Each of the Hemispheres has a Ventricle, with a kind of Corpus Striatum ; and there is also something like a Third and Fourth Ventricle, as in Mammalia. The Thalami Optici are constantly situated, as in Birds, under the Hemispheres, and, as in them also, each contains a Ventricle. There are no distinct Tubercula Quadrigemina, un- less Tubercles situated under the Hemispheres, in some Fishes, are taken for such. The Nerves^ as already noticed, do not bear propor- tion to the size of the Brain, but to that of the parts to which they are destined. They differ from the Nerves of the Animals of the former classes, in having no Ganglia, though in the Genera Cyprinus and Ga- dus, something like Ganglia are found in the Olfactory Nerves. In certain Fishes of the Genus Gadus, as Cod, Had-

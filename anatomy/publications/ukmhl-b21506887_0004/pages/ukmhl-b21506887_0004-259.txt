The inner Glaire incloses the Yolk<f which is contain- ed in a Membrane termed Yolk-hag. The Yolk is proportionally heavier than the Glaire, and has attach- ed to the Membrane which covers it, two white Bodies like coagulated Glaire, termed Chalazce or Grandines. The other extremities of these Bodies, considerably ex- panded, penetrate and float in the Albumen. The Chalazas form two ends of an axis, being placed at the opposite sides of the Yolk, but at a little dis- tance from its centre, in consequence of which the large portion preponderates. On the surface of the Yolk-bag is the Cicatrlcula or Macula, termed also the Tread of the Cock, which is surrounded by concentric circles, the Halones or Cir^ cull, the use of which, and of the Chalazas, is not yet fully ascertained. The Cicatricula, being placed upon the smaller portion of the sphere of the Yolk, is found uppermost in whatever position the Egg happens to be placed. Changes produced upon an Egg in time of Hatching. —This process is effected by the assistance of Atmo- spheric Air, and a certain degree of heat, both of which circumstances are produced by Incubation, or by the Egg being kept for a suflicient length of time, in « air heated in an equal degree with that produced by the Animal. But varnishing an Egg all over stops the progress of Incubation, by obstructing the access of the air, though covering the large end with a var- nish has not that effect.

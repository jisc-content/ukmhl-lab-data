284 OF THE HEART, &c. [Part III. Extremities, join in a Plexus, into which all the other Lymphatics of the Body pass. From this Plexus a short Canal goes out, on each side, which terminates in the Jugular Veins, or in the angles they form with the Subclavians. In a Turtle, the Absorbents of the Posterior parts of the Body go to a Plexus, which surrounds the Right Aorta, and then into a Reservoir situated more for- wards, under the Left Aorta. From this, two Thoracic Ducts, or rather several principal Branches, arise, which advance to those under the Clavicles. Here they join with the Lymphatics of the Anterior Extre- mities, and of the Head and Neck, and form two very intricate Plexus. From the Plexus of the right side, two Branches go out, which terminate in the Jugular Vein, near the angle it forms with the Subclavian. The Left sends out but a single Duct, that opens into the angle of the two Veins. The Absorbents under the Peritoneal Coat of the Intestines, run in straight parallel Branches, according to the length of the Bowel; and a good injection shews them to cover al- most the whole surface of the Gut. The inner surface is no less plentifully supplied with them, though here they have more the appearance of small Cells. From the Intestines, they go in company with the Mesenteric Blood-vessels, and form frequent Plexus and communications. At length they anastomose with the Absorbents of the other parts of the Abdomen, and discharge their contents into the Thoracic Ducts.

The Liver is generally larger in proportion, in this class of Animals, than in the former, especially in Birds of prey, and is observed to be larger in Domesticated than Wild Animals of the same species. The figure is more uniform in Birds. There are commonly two Lobes of equal size which occupy both sides of the Abdomen; but in some, the left is larger than the right, or in others, is divided into two Lobules. It is supported by the surrounding Viscera, and is fixed by Processes derived from the Peritoneum. The colour is a reddish brown, but the tint varying in different Species. The Gall-bladder is placed between the two Lobes of the Liver, and is sometimes closely attached, at other times is loose and pendulous. It is in some oval; in others, of a spherical figure, and, as in the former class of Animals, has its Fundus placed undermost. In many Species of Birds, the Gall-bladder is want- ing, as in a Pigeon^ Parrot^ and Ostrich. The Hepatic Duct, in Birds in general, opens sepa- rately from the Cystic, into the Duodenum. There is no communication between the two Ducts; of course, the Bile found in the Gall-bladder does not get there by regurgitation, as it commonly does in Mammalia, but directly from the Biliary Vessels in the Liver by

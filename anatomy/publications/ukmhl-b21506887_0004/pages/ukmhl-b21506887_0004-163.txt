Part I.] OF MAMMALIA. 159 Exceptions occur to this rule, as some of the Bats and an Opossum^ &c. which have the Caecum of great size. Herbivorous Animals in general have a large Cae- cum, and this, like the Colon, is formed into Cells ; but Ruminants are excepted, their Caecum being uni- form, and of moderate size. Omnivorous Animals, also, as a Monkey, Rat, and Hog, have generally a large Caecum tacked up into Cells. Man, an Ourang-outang, and a Phascolome, (a New Holland Rat), are the only Animals yet found with a Caecum and Appendix Vermiformis distinct. In most others, there is a Caecum without an Appendix; in some Ant-eaters, two small Caeca; in other Animals, only an Appendix; and many have neither the one nor the other. In Animals without a Caecum, the Intestines are every where nearly equal in diameter, contracting on- ly in a small degree towards the extremity of the Rec- tum. The number of the Coats in the Intestines, in Mam- malia, is the same as in the Stomach, varying in thickness and strength according to the size of the Ca- nal, and the kind of Food upon which the Animal lives. The Muscular Coat is generally stronger. The Valvulae Conniventes of the small Intestines are much less distinct in most of the Animals of this class, particularly the Carnivora, than inMan and the Mon- key tribe. In some, even of the Herbivorous kind, they are entirely wanting. The Villi are always present, and generally more evi-

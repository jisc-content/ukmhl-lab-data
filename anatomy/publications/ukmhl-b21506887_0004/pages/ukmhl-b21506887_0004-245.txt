The Esophagus terminates at the upper or fore part of this Sac, and proceeds again from its opposite extremity, the Crop forming a sort of CuUde-Sac between these two orifices. Upon the inner side of the Crop are numerous Glands, with very distinct orifices, in large Birds which throw out a liquor to assist in the solution of the Food. In many, the Glands are in irregular rows. In a Pigeon, &c. which feed the young from the Crop, the Glands swell remarkably till the nourishing in that way is finished.

A Pigeon has a spherical Bag on each side of the Esophagus, and these, in a Poulting Pigeon, are filled with air, which gives the appearance we observe in that /Animal. In a Male Bustard, a Throat Sac is found under the Integuments of the front of the Neck; it opens under the Tongue, but its use is unknown.

Part III.] OF REPTILES. 295 The Epididymis varies in figure and size in the diffe- rent tribes. As in Birds, the Vas Deferens, coming but frotn it, terminates in the Cloaca. In a Turtle^ the Epididymis is a large Canal, which forms the Vas Deferens, that runs in a flexuous manner to open in the Cloaca at the base of the Penis. In Lizards^ the Epi- didymis is detached from the Testicle, and forms a pyramidal Body longer than it. From this the Vas Deferens goes along the edge of the Testicle, in a wa,ving direction, to the Cloaca. In Frogs^ the Vas De^ ferens terminates in a Papilla. The Vesiculse Semina- les, and Prostate Gland, are not found in Reptiles in general. A Frog^ however, has two large Vesicular Seminales. In the Turtle kind there is but one Penis. In most Lizards and Serpents, there are two. In the Frog tribe, the Penis is entirely wanting. In a Tur- tle, it is very large, and in the relaxed state, is retract- ed within the Cloaca. It is composed of two Corpora Cavernosa, and has a Groove in its upper surface, in- stead of a Urethra, the margins of which come so close together when the part is distended, as to form a complete Canal. The Penis has two Retractor Muscles, which run from the Pelvis to the under side of the Glans. In Lizards and Serpents^ the Penises are short and cylindrical, and commonly surrounded with bristles. In the relaxed state, they for ordinary lie in a Pouch under the Skin of the Tail. They are erected by the power of the Muscles of the Tail, and appear at the sides of the Cloaca. Two Retractors from the first Vertebra of the Tail return them to their natural si- tuation in the Pouch.

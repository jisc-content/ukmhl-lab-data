Part IV.] OF FISHES. much larger, compared with their Blood-vessels, than in the former classes. They have frequent communications with each other, and often by transverse Canals ; but in place of form- ing Thoracic Ducts, they unite into Right and Left Plexus, which go to the corresponding sides of the Body. The principal Absorbents of the Chylopoietic Viscera run near the large Branches of the Coeliac and Mesen- teric Blood-vessels, and the principal Lymphatics of the Assistant Chylopoietic Viscera attend the larger Ves- sels belonging to these parts. Besides the Plexus which these form, there is one of a singular nature on the great Curvature of the Sto- mach; it has a Cellular or Cavernous appearance, which does not occur in any otlier part of the Body. Into the Visceral Plexus all the other Absorbents of the Body pass; the Lymphatics of the posterior parts, and of the Organs of Urine and Generation, run for- wards to them. Those of the Trunk go inwards, and those of the Head, Heart, and Gills, form chiefly a single Trunk, which descends. From these Plexus, a Trunk in each side of the Body ends in the Subclavian Vein at the joining with the Internal Jugular, where the fluids are prevented from returning by a pair of Valves. In a Cod, Salmon, and other Osseous Fishes, there are five principal Vessels, which are more conpicuous than the rest ; one runs directly along the middle of the Belly, from the Anus to the Head, and receives the Lymphatics from the parts of the Body near it; another along each side of the Fish, near the great Mucous Duct,

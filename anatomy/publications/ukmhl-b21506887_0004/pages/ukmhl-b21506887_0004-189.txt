Part I.] OF MAMMALIA. 185 The Urethra, as in Man, is continued from the inner lining of the Bladder. In a Horsey it has been ob- served to have, externally, transverse Muscular Fibres from one extremity to the other. It is divided into a Posterior and an Anterior Portion; the former, at the sides of the Verumontanum, receives the Semen and liquor of the Prostate Gland. The posterior portion of the Urethra varies in length in different Genera. In some Apes^ it is short, as in Man. In some other Animals, as a Civet Cat^ Kan- gtiroo Rat, it is about half the length of the Canal. This portion is termed by some Muscular, as being inclosed in a Layer of Muscular Fibres, running more or less in a transverse direction ; and in some, as Soli- peds and Ruminants, it is of a considerable thickness and strength, thereby assisting in the expulsion of the Semen. The other portion of the Urethra begins by a Bulb, and is commonly placed under the Corpora Cavernosa, and inclosed by walls of the same nature with those of these Spongy Bodies. It begins behind by two Crura, each inclosed in a separate Muscle. The Bulb of the Urethra is thin in Carnivora, but of considerable strength in Solipeds, Ruminants, and Belluce. The Glans Peiiis varies, in form and structure, almost in every Genus. In some, as the Ape tribe and Horse, it is dilated somewhat, is in the Human Species. In others, as a Boar, and many Ruminants, it is conical and pointed, and in some turned to one side. Many others, as Carnivora, have it also conical, but with the addition of the Os Penis, which commonly advances to the extremity of the Glans. In an Elephant, it is

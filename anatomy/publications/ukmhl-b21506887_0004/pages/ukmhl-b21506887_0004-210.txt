OF THE BONES we [Part II. Wings at a proper distance in flying, and is strong and expanded in Birds which fly with great force and rapidity. In an Ostrich and Cassowary^ it is imperfect, the lateral Branches not uniting together. The edge of the Scapula, in Birds, is long next the Vertebrae, and the Bone is always destitute of a Spine. The Wings, or Superior Extremities, consist com- monly, on each side, of anOs Humeri—two Bones of the Fore-arm—two of the Carpus^ one of which is Radial and Rhomboidal, the other isUlnar, wedge-shaped, and has a Tubercle, which is sometimes a separate piece, cor- responding with the Os Pisiforme in Mammalia—two generally consolidated into one piece in the Metacar- pus—one in the Thumb—two Fingers, that next the Thumb long, consisting of two Portions, the other has only one. The Os Humeri is articulated with the Clavicle and Scapula, and below has two Articular Pro- cesses, as in Man. The Radius and Ulna move more freely on the Os Humeri; but the Radius cannot turn upon its own axis. Upon the First or Long Finger, and the Metacarpal Bone, the Primary Quills are placed. The Thumb sustains the False or Bastard Quills. The size of the Bones of the Wings varies as occa- sion requires. In Birds of prey, which have to carry their Food frequently to a considerable distance, and others which fly far, they are of great length ; while in domestic Fowls, &c. they are small in proportion to the size of their Bodies. The Bones in the Wings of Penguins are remarkable for their flattened appear- ance, and form a sort of medium between the Wing^ of Birds and the Fins of Fishes.

276 [Part III. OF THE NOSE The Semicircular Canals^ in many of the individuals of this class, approach to a circle ; each has an Am- pulla, and there is a Sac in place of a Vestibule ; but the Fenestra Rotunda, and a complete Cochlea, are wanting, though there is the vestige of the latter in some of the class. In a Tortoise and Lizards, the Sac contains a quantity of chalky matter, which, in a Crocodile and some other Lizards, is formed into three small, soft, stony concretions ; and there is a kind of Cochlea formed hy a prolongation of the Sac. It is of a conical form, is slightly curved, has a Cartilaginous partition, divid- ing it into a double Canal, and is something similar to that in Birds. There is a vestige of it also in Serpents. In siFrog', Toad, and Salamander, the Sac contains also a Cretaceous Matter. The Membranous Labyrinth has many Blood-vessels, which are very visible in some of the large Reptiles. It has also Nerves which are analogous to the Portio Mollis in Man, , and these are plentifully dispersed upon the Sac and the Ampullae. OF THE NOSE. The Organ of Smell is less extensive in Reptiles than in the former classes. Some have two or three Cartila- ginous Eminences, covered by the Schneiderian Mem- brane ; others merely a thickening of that Membrane. These eminences are somewhat analogous to the Con-

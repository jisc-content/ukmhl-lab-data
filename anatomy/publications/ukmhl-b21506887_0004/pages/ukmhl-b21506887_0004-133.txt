In an Asiatic Elepliaiit^ the Temporary Tusks drop out in twelve or thirteen months, and are succeeded by the Permanent Tusks, which continue growing through life. The Molares appear in the second week after birth ; they are succeeded by the second in the second year; the third succeed in the sixth year ; the fourth in the ninth year; others follow, but their epochs are not known. The succession in the Molares of an Elephant, is particularly observed by Mr Corse, (thil. Trans. 1799-) There is never more than one Grinder, and part of another, seen through the Gum. The body of the anterior one is gradually worn away by mastication; the rest of the Tooth is carried off by absorption, the posterior Tooth coming forward to supply its place. The same Processes are found to be repeated at least eight times, and each new Grinder is larger than the former. The first, or Milk Grinder, is composed of four se- parate plates, or partial Teeth, which gradually unite, and cut the Gum between the first and second week after birth. Each succeeding Grinder has an additional number of plates, the last having in all about twenty. It is observed, besides, that every new Grinder takes a year or more than the former for its formation. From the slow manner in which the Tooth advances, a small portion of it only appears beyond the Gum, the rest of it being concealed within the Jaw. The Tooth is completed, therefore, first at its anterior part ; and by VOL. IV. I

Part I.] OF MAMMALIA. 139 seen to greater advantage than in a Human Body. In a Sheep^ Goat^ &c. the Lacteals run in Trunks of considerable size, and are readily detected in Carni- vora, as a Dog, by feeding the Animal with Milk, or other nourishing substances, and a few hours after- wards laying open the Abdomeij. The Absorbent, or Conglobate Glands, are fewer in number, in this class of Animals, but larger, and more collected together^ than in the Human Species. The Glands of the Mesentery, in many of the Mammalia, particularly in Carnivora, are united into a mass, term- ed Pancreas Aselii, in consequence of the Discoverer mistaking them for that Organ. In a few Animals, they form two groups, or in some, one group, and an accessory one. In Ruminants, they are dispersed over the Mesentery, corresponding, seem- ingly, with the great size and length of the Intestines in Herbivorous Animals. The connexion between the Absorbents and their Glands is observed to be less general in Quadrupeds than in Man, there being few instances where Branches reach the Thoracic Duct in a Human Body, without previously entering one or more of them ; whereas, in Quadrupeds, it appears that many Absorbents go di- rectly to the Common Trunk, without the intervention of Glands. The internal structure of the Absorbent Glands has been observed in some of the larger Animals of the class, and in a few, as Solipeds and Cetacea, they have been found to have more of a Cellular than Vascular appearance ; but the ultimate structure here, as in Man, is not yet sufficiently ascertained.

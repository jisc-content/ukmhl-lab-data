In a Locust^ which feeds upon Vegetables, the Canal is long and complicated, the Stomach Mem- branous, and there is a true Gizzard. In some the Stomach is single, in some double, in others manifold.

In several instances, the Esophagus and Rectum are surrounded by a turn of the Spinal Marrow. The Mesentery is wanting in Insects. The Stomach, in the Larva, commonly differs from that of the perfect Insect. In the former, it is for the most part of great size; while in the latter, which take little nourishment, it is remarkably small. Some In- sects, as a Grasshopper^ Cricket, &c. which have a plura- lity of Stomachs, have the power of throwing the Food to the Mouth to be chewed again, and are therefore sometimes termed Ruminating Insects. The Anus, in Insects, not only affords a passage for the Faeces, but incloses the Extremities of the Parts of Generation.

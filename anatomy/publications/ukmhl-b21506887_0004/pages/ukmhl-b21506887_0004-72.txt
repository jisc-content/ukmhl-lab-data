68 OF THE MUSCLES. [Part I. Muscles of the Arm,-^AW the Muscles of the Hume- rus exist here, but with some variety. The Pectoralis Major, as already mentioned, is generally more Fleshy, and divided into different portions. The Latissimus Dorsi differs little. The Supra-spinatus, Infra-spina- tus, Subscapularis, Teres Major, and Teres Minor, differ chiefly in their proportions, corresponding with the form of the Scapula. The Coraco-brachialis exists in Quadrupeds in general ; but in those wanting the Coracoid Process, it arises from the upper edge of the Scapula. Monkeys have the Coraco-brachialis divided into two portions, one of which extends along the whole length of the Humerus. Muscles of the Fore-Arm.â€”The Biceps and Bra- chialis Internus are similar in Monkeysio those in Man, except that the Brachialis arises almost as high as the Neck of the Humerus. In many Quadrupeds, as a Dog, Cat, Horse, he, the IMuscle corresponding to the Biceps has only one Head, which has no connexion with the Coraco-bra- chialis. In Monkeys, the Triceps has an additional portion, which arises from the Tendons of the Latissimus Dorsi and Teres Major. In many other Animals, this fourth portion is found. In Quadrupeds in general, the Ex- tensors are complicated, and of great strength, corre- sponding with the purposes required in their progres- sive motion. In Cetacea, where the two Bones of the Fore-arm are not moveable upon the Humerus, the Triceps is wanting. . But the Anconeus is present in all the Animals mentioned above.

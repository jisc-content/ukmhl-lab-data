Part I.J OF MAMMALIA. 65 of Cartilage. The Anterior Extremitfes of a Seal, &c. form a sort of medium between those of other Mammalia and the Cetacea, being more confined than the former, but less so than the latter. POSTERIOR EXTREMITIES. Os Femoris.'â€”In every class of Animals, the Os Fe- moris, like the Os Humeri, is single. I t varies in length according to that of the Metatarsus. In most Qua- drupeds it is so short, that it scarcely projects beyond the Abdomen, in consequence of which the Leg, pro- perly so called, is commonly termed the Thigli, The Cervix of the Thigh-bone here is remarkably short, but the Great Trochanter rises considerably a- bove the Head of the Bone. In some Animals, as a Horse^ there is an Unciform Process. In a Rhino- ceros, this process and the Trochanter Major form a Foramen between them and the body of the Bone. The Leg Bones are nearly as in Man, but the Tibia, in general, is considerably longer than the Os Femoris. In the Ape tribe, they are more nearly equal. In some of this family, the Bones of the Leg and Thigh are much shorter than those of the Fore-arm and Hu- merus. In a Rat and Mole, the Tibia and Fibula form one continued Bone for about a third of the lower part of their length. ^ In Rodentia, the Fibula is placed entirely behind the Tibia; also in a Dog, where the two Bones are attached through their whole length. In a Horse, the Fibula is only a Rudiment anchy-

Part II.] OF BIRDS. 20S All Birds have a Bone termed Os Quadratum, by which the Lower Jaw is articulated with the Cranium on both sides. Another small Bone is connected with it, and rests by its opposite end against the Palate, in such a manner as to elevate the Upper Jaw when the Square Bone is carried forwards by its Muscles. The Os Hyoides is divided, as in Mammalia, into a Body and two Cornua, which are of a round and slen- der form. The number of the Vertehroe is as variable as in Qua- drupeds. In the Neqk, they are numerous, and vary more than in the other parts of the Spine, the number depepding upon the length of the Neck. The smallest number of Cervical Vertebrae is found in a SparroWy and the greatest in a Swan, the one having only nine, while the other has twenty-three. The Dorsal Verte- bra are fewest in a Bullfinch, being only six in num- ber, and most numerous i|i a Swan, which has eleven. The Lumbar Vertebrae are united into one piece. The smallest number of Sacral Vertebrae exists in a Coot, there being only seven, while an Ostrich has twenty, which is the greatest. A Turkey and Pheasant pos- sess the smallest number of Caudal Vertebrae, viz. five. The greatest number is found in a Starling, Swallow, and Ostrich, which have nine. Each of the Bodies of the Cervical Vertebrae forms a part of a Cylinder, in consequence of which they are allowed free motion. The three or four uppermost Vertebrae can move only forward, and the rest backward, the whole giving the form of anyÂ» but by contracting or widening the two Arches, they can shorten or lengthen the Neck readily,

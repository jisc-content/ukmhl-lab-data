Part IV.] OF FISHES. S35 Tube terminates, are considered as answering the same purpose. In a Cod and Haddock there are no openings, but they have two long blind Processes, which terminate at the Fauces The presence or absence of the Air-bag in Fishes, is extremely variable. It exists in some Species of the same Genus, and not in others, and is considered, therefore, as an Accessory Organ of Motion, the ab- sence of which can be supplied by other means. It is more generally present, and largest, in those of a long and roundish form, as a Cod^ Salmon, &c. and these swim with the greatest velocity; but when the Bag is punctured, or otherwise ruptured, the Animal imme- diately sinks to the bottom. Dead Fishes, on the other hand, where the Bag remains entire, float on the surface of the water, an additional quantity of Air being probably generated by putrefaction, and their Bodies thereby rendered lighter. The Air-bag is for the most part wanting in flat Fishes, as a Skate, Sole, he. their broad surface and side Fins compensating for the want of this Organ; but these Animals can only swim at the bottom of the water. It is wanting, also, in the Shark tribe, but the want . is supplied by the great strength of the Tail. A Lam- prey has none, and though many of the Eel tribe have a small one, these Animals are kept down by the weight of the Tail,

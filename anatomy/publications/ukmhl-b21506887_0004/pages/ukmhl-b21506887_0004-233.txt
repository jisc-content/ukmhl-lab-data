Part II.] OF BIRDS. Some Predaceous and Swimming Birds, and most of the Parrot kind, have a soft Tongue, covered with Pa- pillae, and moistened with Mucus, to enable them to select proper Aliment. In a Parroquet, it is fleshy, very thick, and rounded before. Nocturnal Birds of Preif have it also fleshy, with soft Papillae turned backward. In Gallinacea, the Tongue is triangular, pointed, smooth. Cartilaginous, and destitute of Papillae, except- ing at its root; its firmness preventing it from being injured by the hard and pointed substances upon which they live. In the DucTc kind, it is fleshy and large, but in se- veral of these, it is furnished with ranges of Osseous Laminae ; and almost all the kinds have rigid Hairs upon the sides. In a Swan, it is covered with stiff" Hairs, Osseous Plates, and Fleshy Papillae; and some of these sub- stances are directed backward. In many, as a Toucan, the Tongue is of a Horny consistence, like a piece of Whale-bone; in a Pie, it is forked, or divided into two parts; in an Ostrich, it is of a semilunar form, and remarkably short; in a Pelican, so short, that its existence has been by many denied. The nature of the Tongue is more remarkable in a Wood-cock, and Wood-pecher, than in many other Ani- mals of this class. In a Wood-cocTi:, the Tongue, and also the Larynx, are placed deep in the Esophagus, and the former can be elevated by Muscles peculiar to it. The Tongue of a Wood-pecker is a sharp Horny substance with barbed edges, and fixed at its root to a Cartilaginous Os Hyoides, consisting of a Body and

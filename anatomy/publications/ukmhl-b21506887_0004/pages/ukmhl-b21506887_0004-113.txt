Part I.] OF MAMMALIA. 109 are numerous, to provide as large a surface as possible within the confined space of the Cavity of the Nose. In Apes^ the Ossa Spongiosa Inferiora, seu Poste- riora, in some of their Species, resemble those in Man ; but in others, they approach those of the Ferce and BellucB. In all these Animals, the Lamina in each Nostril is simple at its base, but is forked at a little distance from this; each of the two Laminae that grow from it, coiling up into two, or two and a half turns, according to the Species. The Plates forming the In- ferior Concha contain two Canals, one above, the other below the principal Lamina; the inferior leading into the Posterior Nares. The Inferior Spongy Bones are perforated by nume- rous Holes of different size; but in a Pig, the Lami- na are impervious. In Solipeds, the Inferior Concha is less regular than in the Animals mentioned above ; instead of forking at the base, it bends first down, then up, and is attached to the Maxillary Bone. Among Glh^es, the Hare, Squirrel, and Rat kind, and in Ferce, the Dog and Cat tribe, a Bear, Seal, &c. have the Inferior Spongy Bone extremely compli- cated. The first Lamina is forked, and each Branch subdivided. The last Laminse form a number of pa- rallel Canals for the passage of the air, and the distri- bution of the Nerves. The number of Laminae in the Inferior Conchse is very variable. A Seal and Otter are observed to have them in greatest abundance. Next to these come a Dog and Bear. Among Glires, a Beaver has most, and a Hare least of them. In some of the 1

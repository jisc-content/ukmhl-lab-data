PART IX. OF ZOOPHYTES. Zoophytes have, like Worms, a Cuticle, though in some not very distinct, but no part analogous to the Cutis. The Corpus Mucosum is seen only in a few. An Echinus is covered with a Calcareous Skin, upon which are Tubercles regularly disposed ; and innume- rable Spines, by which the Animal can move in what- ever position it happens to be placed. Among the Spines are a set of smaller Bodies, of different forms, which have been sometimes considered as a sort of Antennae, supplying the place of the Organs of the Senses in the higher classes of Animals. In an Asterias, the covering is of a firm Fibrous texture, and has the interstices of the Fibres filled with Calcareous Granulfe. The Body is divided into Radii or Branches, of which there are commonly five, though sometimes a smaller, at other times a greater number. Throughout the whole length of the Branches, several rows of Feet are attached, which give the Ani- mal a certain degree of motion. A HolotJmrla is covered with a thick Coriaceous Skin, which, by means of longitudinal and circular bands of Muscular Fibres, the Animal can shorten or lengthen at pleasure. Some of the Animals of this Genus have numerous Feet, which are either spread

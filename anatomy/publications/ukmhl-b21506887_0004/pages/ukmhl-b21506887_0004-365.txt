Part VI.] OF CRUSTACEA. S61 are moved jpy particular Muscles, and possess a true power of mastication. The Stomach is situated in the Thorax, above the Mouth, and, from its particular structure, is prevent- ed from contracting and dilating like the Stomach of other Animals. The small Intestine is straight and cylindrical, but, towards its middle, it has a strong Valve and a long Caecum. Liver, &e.—The greater part of this class have no proper Liver. The Bile is derived from a collection of Intestinula Caeca, similar to those which supply the place of Pancreas in Osseous Fishes. They are of a yellow colour, and contain a bitter brown fluid, which they discharge into the beginning of the Intestine. These, together with the Stomach, fill almost the whole of the Thorax, the former composing the high- flavoured substance in a Crab and Lobster. Shrimps have a Liver of a different nature from that of other Crustacea ; being a solid Conglomerate Gland, arranged along the two sides of the Intestines, through their whole length. Organs of Generation.—Here the Testes in the Male, and Ovaria in the Female, are in some united together, and their External Organs are double. In a Crab, Lobster, &c. the Male has two Penises, and the Female two Vulvae. In the Male, the Testes are two Glandular-like Bo- dies, separate in a Crab, but united in a Lobster, and here placed under the Heart. From the Testes, two convoluted Vasa Deferentia pass out, which end in corresponding Penises behind the Fifth Pair of Feet.

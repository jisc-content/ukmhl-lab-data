Part II.} OF BIRDS. m a Pulpy substance, inclosed in Cells. The Pulp is by degrees absorbed, and the part assumes the appearance of a Corpus Cavernosum. The Stalk is convex on one side, and concave, and furrowed in the middle, on the other. Upon the sides of the Stalk are Barbes, com- posed of Horny Laminae, and beset laterally with Hairs or Barbules. The Feathers on the Wings and Tail are termed Pens or Quills; those on the Bones, analo- gous to the Fore-arms, are termed Secondary. The Feathers vary exceedingly in appearance in dif- ferent Birds.

Some Birds have Feathers not only on their Bodies, but also on their Feet; and some, as Moor Game, , have them on their Feet in the winter season only. Some, as a Vulture and Turkey, want them on the Head. Several have two or more Feathers arising from a common Quill. In the Penguin kind, the Feathers of the Wing are in the form of small Scales. In a Cassowary, they are like the Quills of a Porcupine, being destitute of Barbules. The Feathers of Birds are annually changed, or there is a moulting-season ; but all Feathers are not found to fall at the same time. In several Birds, where a Male and Female have different Plumage, it is observed that the latter, after ceasing, through age, to lay Eggs, assumes the PluÂ» mage of a Male. Birds have Claws commonly on the Toes ; and in

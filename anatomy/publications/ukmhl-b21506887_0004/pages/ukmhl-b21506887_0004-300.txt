m OF THE MALE ORGANS [Part III. A Rattle-snake and Viper have al^o double Pe- nises ; each of which is bifid, and beset with bristles. In a Crocodile^ the Penis is single, and has a deep Fissure throughout, formed principally of one Corpus Cavernosum, Oegans of Apprehension. Besides the common Organs of Generation, a few Male Animals have Accessory Organs, by which they are enabled to fix upon the Female. Among those of the Reptile tribe are to be observed, the Spongy Ball upon the Thumb, and part of the Palm, of the Frog' kind. They are composed of hard Papillae. By means of these, the Male, when in season, fixes firmly upon the Back of the Female, which he squeezes, and con- tinues there for days, or even weeks, in the water, till the Semen is ejected, which takes place in both sexes about the same time; the two fluids mixing together without any copulation. After the Semen is emitted, the Animals separate from each other, and have no con- nexion till the season of their amours yeturns

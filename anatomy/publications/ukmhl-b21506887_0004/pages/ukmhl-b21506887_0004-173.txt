In some Animals, as a Horse^ which are destitute of a Gall-bladder, the dilatation of the Hepatic Duct, at its origin, is so large as to form a sort of reservoir for the Bile. In an Equus Quagga, however, an Animal lately introduced into this country from the Cape, though the Gall-bladder is wanting, there is no dilatationin the Hepatic Duct. The Ductus Com- munis, in the Cat tribe, after perforating the Muscular Coat of the Intestine, forms an Ampulla with two a- partments, previous to its termination. In a Pig, the Ductus Communis is of great size, and terminates very near the Pylorus. In an Elephant, nine or ten Biliary Ducts unite into a Trunk, which forms an oval Sac in the substance of the Duodenum. This divides into Cells, one of which terminates in the Intestine by a small orifice. In a Dolphin and Porpoise, the Hepa- tic Duct terminates in the last of the Stomachs. Besides the Biliary Canals mentioned above, there are in some Animals, as a Hare, Dog, Ox, and Sheep, others, termed Hepato-cystic, which terminate in the Body or Neck of the Gall-bladder, and thus convey the Bile directly into it from the Liver. Pancreas, The form, proportional size, and colour of the Pan- creas, vary a little in different Quadrupeds ; but the structure of this Conglomerate Gland is the same as in Man. In most Mammalia, it is separated into Branches, which extend in different directions, its principal part being always placed transversely behind the Stomach, and between the Spleen and Duodenum.

OF THE MALE ORGANS [Part IV. 340 The first is a mass of spherical Glandular Bodies, which, in a common-sized Sli^ate^ are nearly as large as Peas, and press against each othfer, being intimately connected together, and covered by a delicate Mem- brane. The other portion is formed of a uniform Glandular Substance, something like the soft Roe or Milt of Osseous Fishes. The Epididymis^ here, is also of great size, and formed of a large Canal making innumerable convolu- tions. From this goes out a Vas Deferens, which runs along the edge of the corresponding Kidney in a zig- zag manner; increasing in diameter, till it terminates in a Vesicula Seminalis near the Anus. At the outer side of the Vesicula Seminalis, is a Bag filled with a greenish matter, which is discharged into the Sac for receiving the Semen. By some Authors, this Bag is considered as a Vesicula Seminalis ; by Dr Monro, as supplying the place of a Prostate Gland. In some other Cartilaginous Fishes, as a Torpedo^ the Vas Deferens and the Vesicula open into the Cloaca by means of a Papilla, the Penis being absent here, as well as in the other Animals of the Class. In the other kind, or Roe Fishes, the Testes hold nearly the same situation as in a Raja and Squalus, and are large Glandulo-membranous Sacs; in some Cylindrical, in others Conical, &c. The size increases greatly at the spawning season; at other times, they can scarcely be distinguished from the Roe. They are filled with a white Milky-like matter, the Semen, which appears to be deposited in Cells. Through the middle of each Testicle passes a Vas Deferens, which unites with its fellow at the posterior

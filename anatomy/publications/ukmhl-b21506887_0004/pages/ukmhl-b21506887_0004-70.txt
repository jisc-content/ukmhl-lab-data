m OF THE MUSCLES. [Part I. to the Ribs, but to the Transverse Processes of the Cervical Vertebrae. Muscles situated between the Ribs, and within the Thoracc.—The Intercostal and Sterno-costal Muscles are nearly as in Man, only the latter Muscle is gene- rally larger, and may therefore act more powerfully upoh the Ribs. Muscles situated on the hiferior part of the Vertebrce of the Neck.—The Muscles on the inferior part of the Vertebrae of the Neck are not materially different from the corresponding Muscles of the Human Body, but generally have their Fleshy Bellies proportionally larger and more distinct. Muscles of the Spine and Superior parts of the TrunJc in general,—In Apes, the Muscles of the Spine differ only in the strength of their Tendons. In the other Mammalia, they differ in the number of their attach- ments, which depends upon that of the Vertebras. The motions of the Os Coccygis are much more visible in the rest of Mammalia than in Man. The Tail, which is merely an elongation of it, can in general be moved readily in every direction; may even be turned upon its own axis, or rolled spirally. The Muscles of the Os Coccygis in Animals with prehensile Tails are remarkably numerous, to assist them in climbing, as in Mon'keys and Opossums, or in springing, as in Kanguroos. The Spine of a Horse is remarkable on account of the great breadth of the Ligamentum Nuchas, which as- sists in supporting the Head. There is likewise a pe- culiarity of this substance in a Mole, where a large

They have neither moveable Cartilages nor Mus- cles, but are formed of Laminae covered by the Skin, which is expanded over the Beak. There is no proper Ethmoid Bone in Birdsj though they have distinct Ossa Spongiosa^ which divide the Cavity of the Nose into different Meatus. The MembranaPituitaria is plentifully supplied with Vessels, which furnish abundance of Mucus. The Internal Nares commonly open by one chink upon the Palate, which is beset with soft pointed Pa- pillae, turned backward, and furnished with Muscles, by which it can be shut at pleasure. The Palatum Molle is wanting. The Foramina Incisiva vary in number, size, and situation, in different Birds. In some, there is but a single opening, which is large; in others, there are more, but small. In some, it is placed near the point, in others, at the Base of the Bill. The Nose, as in the former class of Animals, is co- piously furnished with Nerves; the Olfactory come from the fore part of the Anterior Lobe of the Brain, and pass along a Canal, after which they form innumerable Fibrillae, dispersed upon the Membrana Mucosa. In Water Fowls, particularly in the Duck tribe, the Nerves of the Nose, viz. the Olfactory, and a Branch of the Fifth Pair, are uncommonly large, and can be easily traced to the end and edges of their Bills ; m consequence of which, they are enabled to search for their food in water, mud, &c. p 2

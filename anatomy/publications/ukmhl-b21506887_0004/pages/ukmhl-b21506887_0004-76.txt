OF THE MUSCLES. 7.^ [Part I. no Great Toe, as a Dog and Rabbit, is inserted into the first of their Toes. In Solipeds and Ruminants, it is inserted into the Base of the Canon Bone. The Tibi- alis Posticus, in Animals destitute of a Great Toe, is inserted into the first Toe. It is wanting in Quadru- peds with Canon Bones. The Peroneus Longus, in the Ape kind, is peculiar for drawing the Great Toe towards the other Toes. In Animals without a Great Toe, it is inserted into the Metatarsal Bone of the first Toe. In Ruminants, it crosses over the Joint of the Canon Bone, to be inserted into the first Os Cunei- forme. The Peroneus Brevis and Tertius, in clawed Animals, are as in Man. A Horse has but one Pe- roneus. In Ruminants, the Peroneus Brevis is wanting. Muscles of the Toes.â€”Monheys have two Extensors of the small Toes ; but, besides an Extensor PoUicis, there is an Abductor Longus Pollicis, which is peculiar to this tribe of Animals. Other digitated Animals have the same number as in a Human Body. The Extensor Pollicis is wanting in Animals destitute of a Great Toe, as a Dog and Rabbit, In Solipeds and Ruminants, the Fleshy Fibres arise from the Canon Bone, and are inserted into the Tendon of the Exten- sor Longus, so as to supply the place of the Extensor Digitorum Brevis. In Ruminants, there is an Extensor Proprius analo- gous to the Extensor Pollicis ; but in Solipeds, it is wanting. In Monkeys, the Aponeurosis of the sole, continued from the Plantaris, must affect the Metatarsal Bones, into which it is inserted. The long and short Flexors of the Toes are confusedly connected to each other?

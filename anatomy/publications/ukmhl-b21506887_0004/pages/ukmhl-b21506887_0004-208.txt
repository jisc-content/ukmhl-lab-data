204 OF THE BONES [Part 11. The Atlas has the shape of a ring, and is only connect- ed with the Head by a single articulation in the form of ball and socket. From the whole of this structure, such motion is allowed, that Birds have the peculiar power of placing the Bill under the Wing when they rest, a good example of which is seen in a Duck. The Dorsal Vertebrae have the Spinous Processes tied together by strong Ligaments, and they are often united into a solid mass. The Transverse Processes send off two points, one forwards, the other backwards, which join those of the other Vertebrae, and the parts here are sometimes also anchylosed; but in Birds that cannot fly, as an Ostrich and Cassowary, the Verte- brae remain moveable. The Lumbar Vertebrae are commonly ossified toge- ther, and also to the Bones of the Sacrum and Pelvis, so as to give the appearance of a single Bone. The two lateral Parts of the Pelvis do not close before, to form a Symphysis Pubis, excepting in an Ostrich, There is generally a Foramen Thyroideum, and the Ischiatic Notch is formed into a complete Foramen. The Caudal Vertebras are found in greatest number in Birds which move their Tail most freely, as Mag- pie and Swallow, The last Vertebra of the Tail is the largest, and is often in form of a plough-share, for the attachment of the Quills. In a Peacock, it is of an oval form, and situated horizontally. The Thorax, in Birds, is commonly remarkably large in proportion. The Ribs have several peculiari- ties in their form and attachments. Their Vertebral Extremity is forked, one of the Branches resting upon the Body of the Vertebra, the other upon its Trans-

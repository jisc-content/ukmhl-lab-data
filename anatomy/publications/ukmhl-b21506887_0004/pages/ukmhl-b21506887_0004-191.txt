Part I.] OF MAMMALIA. Muscles, of the Penis.â€”The Erector Penis, and Accelerator Urinae, exist in all Mammalia, but vary according to circumstances. Besides these, certain Animals, as some of the Aj)es, Dog, Hare, Ruminants, Elephant, &c. have others, for supporting and giving proper direction to the Penis. Of the Blood-vessels, the Arteries are nearly of the same nature as in Man. The Veins form an intricate Plexus on the Dorsum Penis, from which Branches go to those of the Groin. The Nerves are comparative- ly very large, and embrace the Veins as well as the Arteries.

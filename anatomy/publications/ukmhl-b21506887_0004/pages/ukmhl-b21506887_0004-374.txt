370 OF INSECTS. [Part VII. under the Skin, and generally opens externally by nine or ten apertures, termed ISt'igmata. From these the same number of Air-vessels, or Branchiae, of a silver colour, pass off, to be dispersed through the Body by innumerable Branches, but particularly on the Ali- mentary Canal, and on the part compared to the O- mentum. The above is the most common distribution of the Tracheae; but in several Aquatic Larvae, and even perfect Insects, the Air enters by two openings near the Anus, at the end of the Abdomen. Hymenop- tej^a and Di/ptera have two principal Tracheae, with some small ones, at the base of the Abdomen. Ara- nece have no Tracheae ; their organs of Respiration are confined to a few Vesicles, but which have an aperture at each side of the base of the Abdomen. The Tracheae of Insects are described by authors as being composed of an outer, inner, and middle Mem- brane, the last of which is formed of Spiral Fibres. Insects are incapable of forming any Voice ; the noise which many of them make is formed chiefly by their Wings, as may readily be perceived by depriving them of these parts. Alimentary Canal.â€”The Esophagus is a straight short Tube, reaching from under the Brain to the first Gan- glion of the Nerves. The rest of the Canal differs much in appearance in different kinds of Insects, and in different stages of the same individual. In the Lar- vae state, it is of great size,' particularly the Stomach, when compared with that of the perfect Insect. In Insects, as in other Animals, the same propor- tional size is preserved in the Animal and Vegetable eaters, the Canal being always short in the former, and

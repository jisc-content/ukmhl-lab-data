[Part III. OF THE BRAIN of the Organ of Hearing. The Eighth and Ninth have nothing remarkable. The Great Sympathetics have evident Ganglia, like those of Birds, and are also connected with the neighbouring Nerves. They form a Cardiac Plexus, a Ramus Splanchnicus, and are at last lost upon the origin of the Tail. The Cervical Nerves, in a Tortoise, are distributed nearly as in Mammalia. The three last p^rs enter in- to the composition of the Brachial Plexus. ^ In other Reptiles, the Nerves vary in number and distribution, according to the number of the Cervical Vertebrae, and the presence or absence of the Ribs. Of the Brachial Plexus, the three last Cervicals, and first Dorsal, go to the Anterior Extremity. In Frogs, instead of a Plexus, a single large Nerve goes to the Anterior Extremity. In Serpents, the Brachial Plexus is wanting, there being no external Members. There is no proper Diaphragmatic Nerve in any of the class, the Muscle itself being absent. The Dorsal and Lumbar Nerves agree in number with that of the Vertebrae. The Sacral and Caudal Nerves are not very distinct. They lose themselves in the Bones, Muscles^ and Skin of the posterior parts of the Body. The Posterior Extremity has the same distinction of Obturator, Anterior Crural, and Sciatic Nerves, as in Mammalia; but they vary a little in their origins and distributions, according to the shape of the Mem- ber. In a Frog, these nerves are readily traced.

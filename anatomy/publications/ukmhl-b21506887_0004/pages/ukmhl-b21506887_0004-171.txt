167 Part I.] OF MAMMALIA. tera^ Glires, and Ferce, the Lobes are fewer ; but in most of them, they are in greater number, and much more distinctly separated from each other, than in Man. In FercB, in particular, as a Dog, Cat, Lion, &c. the Fissures are very deep, and run through the whole mass. The Lobes divided in this manner, have been considered by some Authors, as allowing the parts to slide on each other, in Animals with very flexible iSpines ; while others are of a different opinion. In the orders Solipeda, Pecora, Belluce, and Cetacea, the Lobes are less numerous than in Man. A Hog has four, but a Horse^ Ruminants, Ele- phant, and Cetacea, have only two, and these not more separated than in a Human Subject. In a Horse, Ox, &c. with rigid Spines, the Liver is in one piece, and has no Ligamentum Latum, being sufficiently sup- ported by the Muscles of the Abdomen. Gall-bladder,â€”The Gall-bladder exists in all the Ape tribe ; in Bradypoda, excepting Sloths ; in most of the Ferod, as Weasels, the Dog and Cat kind ; and in most Ruminants; but it is wanting in many of the Glires, particularly in several of the Rat tribe ; in Solipeds ; in a Camel, Goat, and Deer, among Ruminants ; in an Elephant and Rhinoceros among Belluce; and in a Trichecus, Porpoise, and Dolphin, among Cetacea. All the Mammalia that want a Gall-bladder are ve- getable eaters, excepting a Porpoise and Dolphin, Its situation is constantly under the right Lobe of the Liver, when there are two, and under the middle Lobe, when there are more than two. It has com-

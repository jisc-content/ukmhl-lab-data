37 Part I.] OF MAMMALIA. BONES OF THE H^AD. Cranium.â€”Next to the Human Species, the Ape tribe is found to have the largest Cranium in proportion to the Face; but the Cranium is small here when com- pared with that of a Human Body. While, in a European Man, the Area of a longitudinally vertical section of the Cranium, the Lower Jaw excepted, greatly exceeds that of the Face ; in a Monkey the pro- portion is much less. In the Ferae, the Glires, Solipeds, Pecora, Belluce, it gradually decreases ; and in propor- tion as the Cranium becomes less than the Face, the Animal is observed to become more stupid or feroci- ous ; though to this rule there are many exceptions. The Facial Angle of Camper assists in discovering the proportion between the Cranium and Face. It is more obtuse in the Human Species, and more acute as we descend in the scale from Man, till in the lower classes of Vertebral Animals it disappears. In a Hu- man Adult European, the angle is about 85^ ; in an aged European 75^; in an Ourang-outang 67^; in some of the other Monkeys, it goes so low as SC^; and among the other Genera of Quadrupeds, it is in some only 20<=*. The Temporal and Occipital Ridges, or Cristae, vary considerably in different Quadrupeds. They serve chiefly for the attachment of the strong Temporal and Cervical Muscles attached to them, and are most con- siderable in Carnivorous Animals. The situation and

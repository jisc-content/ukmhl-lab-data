Part I.] , OF MAMMAXIA. 157 In Omnivorous Animals, as a Rat and Pig^ the length of the Canal forms a medium between those which feed upon Flesh, and others living upon vege- table substances. A difference of length has also been observed between the Intestines of wild and tame Animals, some of the former having the Canal shorter, and others longer, in proportion. In a Wild Boar and Cat^ the length of the Canal, compared with that of the Body, has been found much less than in the tame Animals of the same Species. In a Wild Rabbit, on the contrary, it is con- siderably greater than in the tame one. Mammalia, as well as most other Vertebral Animals, have a distinction into Small and Great Intestines. The Small are commonly the longest, and are Villous within. The Large are thicker in their Muscular and Internal Coats, and are seldom furnished with Villi in- ternally ; which last circumstance forms a distinction between the two parts of the Canal, when other marks are deficient. In Carnivorous Animals, the Canal is generally more nearly equal in size than in the Herbivorous. The Muscular Coat is proportionally stronger, and there are no distinct Valvulae Conniventes. From these cir- cumstances, and also from the nattire of the Aliment, the process of digestion is in them more quickly per- formed. A Horse and Elephant are remarkable for the di- mensions of their Colon, which, in the former, is seven or eight yards in length, while, in a middle-sized Dog, it is only found to be about eight or ten inches long. Many Quadrupeds, as a Badger, Rell Mouse, &c.

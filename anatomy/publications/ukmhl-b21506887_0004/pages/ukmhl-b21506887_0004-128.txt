[Part I. OF THE MOUTH, &c. proach so near to a circle, as to render them ill adapted for the purposes to which they are applied at an early time of life. The Molares exist in every Animal possessing Teeth, a Narwal excepted, which has only the long Tusk mentioned above. The situation and appearance of the Grinding Teeth vary considerably in this class of Ani- mals. In Feroe, the Bodies of these Teeth are en- tirely covered with Enamel; and the same thing takes place in the Animal coMedi Mammoth, or Carnivoi^oiis Elephant; while the Grinders of Quadrupeds living chiefly on vegetables, and the Incisores of a Horse, have plates of Enamel extending into the Substance of the Tooth, and mixed in a tortuous manner with the Osseous part. These Animals have, besides, an addi- tional substance in their Molar Teeth, differing in its nature from the two others, being like Tartar, and termed by Dr Blake, Crusta Petrosa, and by Cuvier, Cement. This may be readily seen either in a longitu- dinal or transverse section of the Tooth of a Horse or Ox, but still better in the Tooth of an Elephant, where it forms a large proportion of the mass. It is then distinguished by the greater degree of yel- lowness and opacity of its colour, and is considered by the two Authors mentioned above, as being originally deposited from the Capsule which forms the Enamel. It fills the interstices on the Surface of the different layers of the Enamel, and unites the layers together. It is the softest of the three component parts of the Tooth, and is more readily affected by acids and fire than the Osseous substance. It is sometimes, as in a Cow, Sheep, &c. not completely formed in the centre of the

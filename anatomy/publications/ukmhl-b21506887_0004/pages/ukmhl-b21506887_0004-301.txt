m Paut III.] OF REPTILES. OF THE FEMALE ORGANS OF GENERATION. All Reptiles have two Ovaria, two Oviducts, and one or two Uteri. The Ovaria are commonly more extensive in propor- tion than in Birds. The Ova increase so much in some, as Frogs and Toads, towards spawnin^-time, as to dis- tend the Abdomen. The Ovaria are fixed by two long prolongations of the Peritoneum, to each side of the Spine, as far as the Pelvis. Along the loose edge of the Ligament are arranged the Ova, in some like rows of Beads, in others they are in clusters. The Oviducts are Membranous Tubes fixed by the Peritoneum to the sides of the Spine, At their origin, they are delicate ; in their course, they become thicker, and, in general, are much longer in proportion than in Birds. In the Turtle kind, there are two Ovaria, two Ovi- ducts, and two Uteri. The Oviducts are thin and de- licate, the Uteri thick and fleshy. Each has an open- ing into the Cloaca, in which, according to Blumen- BACH, there is an evident Clitoris. In Serpents, the Ovaria are like rows of Beads, and are composed of yellow Vesicles. The Oviducts are much convoluted, and are connected with double ex- ternal openings of Genitals, which receive the double Organs of the Male,

30.^ OF THE BONES [Part IV. conical cups, containing a glairy matter. The edges of the cops are joined to those of the contiguous Vertebrae through the whole length of the Spine, by Cartilages composed of concentric Fibres. The last Vertebra is generally triangular and flat, and lies in a vertical di- rection, corresponding with the Fin of the Tail. Of the Spinous Processes, one set is placed above, and another below the Bodies of the Vertebras. Be- tween the Bodies of the Vertebrae and Roots of the Superior Spinous Processes, is the Canal for the Spinal Marrow ; while there is frequently a passage between the Bodies and Inferior Spinous Processes for the great Blood-vessels. The Vertebrae are connected to the Head, in Osseous Fishes, by a single Condyle under the Foramen Occi- pitis, while, in the Cartilaginous kind, there are two Tubercles. Fishes have no proper Thorax, the Abdominal Vis- cera occupying the Cavity of the Trunk, which is form- ed by the Spine and the Ribs where they exist, for few of the individuals of the class possess a Sternum. The number and magnitude of the Ribs vary much here. In some, the size is considerable; in others, as a Herring, they are like small bristles; in many, they are forked through the greater part of their length; in some, double throughout. In most Fishes, the Ribs are articulated with the Bodies of the Vertebras; in some, they are fixed to the Transverse Processes only. The Anterior Extremities of Fishes are their Pectoral Fins, composed, as Fins are in general, of Osseous Rays, and each of these of several articulations, all of which are joined by a common Membrane. They are

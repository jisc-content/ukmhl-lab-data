369 Part VII.] OF INSECTS. by some, the posterior pair of Palpi by others, but commonly the long Tube in a Butterfly^ has been con- sidered as the Tongue. Many of the Butterflies, Bees, Ants, Common Flies, and Spiders, have a spiral or Tubular Tongue, or a soft Proboscis, in a horny point- ed Tube, by which they suck in their nourishment. No Salivary Glands are observed in the Mouths of In- sects though a fluid similar to Saliva, but varying in colour in different Insects, is observed to come from the Mouths of these Animals. Circulating System,—No real Circulating System has been found in proper Insects, yet many of them, both in the Larvae and perfect state, have a Membra- nous Canal along the Back, in which alternate con- tractions and dilatations are discerned. In a Cater- pillar, the pulsation begins at the posterior extremity of the Animal, and proceeds from one segment of the Body to another, till it arrives at the Head. This Vessel is therefore considered by some Authors as the Heart, but it is closed at the extremities, and no Vessels are seen going from or to it. Nutrition and Secretion, therefore, are supposed to be effected in a different manner from what takes place in more perfect Animals. Cuvier considers Imbibition to be the mode by which these are performed. Respiratory Or^aw.?.—-Respiration is performed by Tracheae ramified over most of the Body, but chiefly on the Intestines; there are, however, no Cellular Lungs. The Tracheae are much larger and more nu- merous in the Larvae of Insects, than in the perfect state. In Larvae, a Trachea runs on each side of the Body, VOL. IV. 2 A

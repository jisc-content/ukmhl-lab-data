Part IX.] OF ZOOPHYTES. 38S over, or situated upon, the side of the Body. In some, the Feet are entirely wanting. The other orders of Zoophytes have a contractile power residing in their substance, somewhat similar to that of the Molhisca Nuda. A Medusa^ by alternately rendering its Body convex or flat, can so displace the water as to fit it for swimming; but Muscular Fibres cannot be discovered here, probably on account of their transparency. An Actinia has such a contractile power in its Skin, as to assume a variety of forms. It can turn itself in- to a plain surface, or become cylindrical or conical, &c. at pleasure. In a Ht/dra, or common Polypus, only some move- able Tentacula are found. The small Animals termed' Vorticella and Botifera^ are observed, by the assistance of glasses, to have Cilia of different forms, moving round their axis with great rapidity. In .the mouth of an Echinus are five Teeth of great size, which surround the entry to the Esophagus, and have Muscles for enabling them to masticate their Food. A Star-fish has no Teeth, but a round Mouth, which leads, by a short Esophagus, to the Stomach. The Spines round the Mouth, though no proper Teeth, are observed to lay hold of the prey. A Holothuria has a large Mouth, surrounded by semi-osseous Plates, which serve chiefly for the attach- ment of Muscles and Tentacula. Round the Mouth are Sacs, which open into it, and are supposed to dis- charge a kind of Saliva. Monades, and other Microscopical Animals, ap- pear to be extremely simple, having neither any appa-

Pakt I V.J OF FISHES. 801 or simply round ; or some have them sharp, and in the form of wedges. In a Sharks the Teeth are flat and very numerous, but without Fangs, and are placed in rows. The front row only is perpendicular, and exposed ; the rest are smaller, and turned back, and covered by the Gums, but come forward so as to supply the place of the Front Teeth, when any of these are lost. The situation of the Teeth is very variable. They are placed in the Jaws,—or in the Palate,—or in the back part of the Septum Narium, or in the Bone which supports the Tongue,—or in that which supports the Branchiae,—or at the beginning of the Esophagus; and named, from their situation, Mandibular, Pala- tine, &c. Some, as a Salmon and Pike, have Teeth in all parts of their Mouth. The Squalus Pristis, or Saw-fish, has Teeth in both sides of the sword-shaped Bone in front of the Head. In some, the Teeth are wanting in certain parts of the Mouth only. A Perch has them in every part of the Mouth, excepting the Tongue, A Sturgeon has no Teeth. The number of the Vertebrce is also very variable in this class. In Osseous Fishes the Vertebrae of the Neck are wanting, or there are not more than three or four. In the SJcafe kind, they are united into one piece. The Vertebrae of the rest of the Spine vary extremely* being from about 20 to upwards of 100. Some Sharks have about 200. In some, they are cylindrical; in others, angular; in others, flattened. They are arti- culated by their Bodies, having no oblique Processes, The bodies of the Vertebrae are hollowed out into

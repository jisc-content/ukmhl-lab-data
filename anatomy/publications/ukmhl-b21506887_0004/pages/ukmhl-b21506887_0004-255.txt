It becomes larger by degrees, and terminates in the Cloa- ca, distinct from the Ureter ; but frequently, before its termination, it dilates into an oval Sac, that is con- sidered by some authors as supplying the place of a Vesicula Seminalis. The Duct is commonly full of an opaque white fluid, and its outer extremity, in some Birds, as a Duck, is situated between two Erector Muscles, which, by compression, can discharge its con- tents. The Prostate Gland, in this class of Animals, i& wanting. In general, each Vas Deferens terminates in a Penis peculiar to itself, which is a mere Papilla, placed at the side of the common Cloaca, and pointing outwards, as in a Cock, Turkey, Pigeon, and large Birds of prey. In some, as the Duck kind, Swan^ &c. the Vasa Deferentia terminate in a single Penis, which is of considerable size, and in the relaxed situation, is a simple Tube, coiled up, and concealed in a Pouch opening into a Cloaca. In the erect state, it is some inches in length, but this varies according to the size of the Animal. Some Muscles are placed at its root, for giving it the necessary degree of erection, its own elasticity after- wards relaxing it. In an Ostrich, Hocko, and Cassowary, the Penis is similar to that in a Drake ; but, in place of a Tube, there is only a Groove for conducting the Semen from the Cloaca. ^No rule is yet found with respect to the Birds that have a double or a single Penis,

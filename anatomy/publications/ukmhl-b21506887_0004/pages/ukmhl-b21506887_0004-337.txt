OF THE AIR-BAG, HE Air-bag is situated between the Mesentery and the Spine, to which it adheres, in some through its whole length, in others only partially. It is very variable in form in different Genera and Species. It is commonly simple, as in a Salmon and Cod; double, as in Cyprini; in others long, round, or oval. It consists of two Membranes, the outer of which is regarded by some as Muscular, and is covered partially by the Peritoneum. In a Cod^ and also in a Sea Perch^ a pair of Muscles run along the sides of the Air-bag, and these are assisted in their action by the great Lateral Muscles upon the Bodies of Fishes. It contains a quantity of air, differing in its nature in different Fishes. Nitrogen, with a small portion of Carbonic Acid Gas, has been found in a Carp, Hy- drogen in a Tench, and Oxygen in a SharJc.

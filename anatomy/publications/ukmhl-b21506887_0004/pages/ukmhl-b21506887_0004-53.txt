Part I.] OF MAMMALIA. 49' Sternum, than in the Human Species, especially in long- legged Animals. Rihs are present in all the individuals of this class. They vary in number in different tribes ; the greater number of Mammalia possess more Ribs than are found in Man, though in a few the number is smaller. There is also considerable variety in the form of the Ribs ; in Herbivorous Animals^ they are observed to be broad and thick. An Armadillo has the two first pairs very large in proportion to the rest. A two-toed Ant-eater has Ribs so broad as to overlap like the tiles of a house, and give the appearance of a coat of mail. The number of the Ribs on each side of the Thorax of Mammiferous Animals, corresponds v/ith that of the Dorsal Vertebra, and can therefore be readily known by examining the preceding Table. Sternum.â€”This, in an Ourang-owtang, is broad and flat as in Man, but in other Apes, and in many Mam- malia, it is narrow and of a roundish form ; and com- posed of several moveable pieces, corresponding to the motions of the Spine. In Bats it is like a T, the fore part going across to be articulated with the Clavicles, A Mole has the Anterior Extremity prolonged be- fore the Ribs, to be joined to the Clavicles under the Neck, so as to give origin to strong Muscles of the An- terior Extremities, which assist the Animal in burrow- ing under the ground. A Horse and Elephant have the Sternum flattened laterally. VOL. IV. D

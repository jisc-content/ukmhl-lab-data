317 OF FISHES. Part IV.] OF THE EAR. The Organ of Hearing, in Fishes, is as distinct as in other Animals, and much greater in proportion than in Mammalia or Birds. Partaking of the growth of all the other parts, it increases in size, in proportion to the age and bulk of the Animal. The different parts of the Ear, in this class, are more readily traced than in the former, not only on account of the size, but also from the looseness and softness of the parts. The Ears are divided into two kinds, according as the Fishes are Cartilaginous or Osseous, the former possessing certain parts which are not found in the latter. Of the Cartilaginous FisJies, a large Shate is here taken as an example. A little before the joining of the Head and Spine, on the Dorsal side of the Animal, there are two Fora- mina, placed obliquely, and at a little distance from each v other, capable of admitting a large Hog's bristle, which are the Mouths of the External Auditory Passages. These are detected by pressure, when a small quanti- ty of Milky-like liquor is found to issue from them. Each Foramen leads to a winding Canal, or a kind of Concha, almost of a circular form, lying under the Skin, and containing some chalky fluid. The bottom of this is of a Funnel shape, and ends

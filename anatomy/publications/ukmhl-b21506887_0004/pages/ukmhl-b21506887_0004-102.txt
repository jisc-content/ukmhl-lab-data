In other Quadrupeds, the Eye has a peculiar Muscle, termed Suspensorius, which may assist the others according to the direction of its Fibres. It arises, with the straight Muscles, from the edge of the Foramen Opticum, and, running between these and the Ball, is fixed to the Sclerotis a little be- hind the insertion of the Recti Muscles. In a Horse and Ruminants, it is in the form of a Funnel; but in the greater part of Camivora, and in Cetacea, it forms four distinct Muscles. In a Rhinoceros, it is divided into two parts ; but besides this Muscle, Mr Thomas of London has discovered, that this Animal has four Tendinous Processes, which arise from the inner side of the Sclerotis, at the bottom of the Eye. These spread out and join anteriorly, to form a kind of Mus- cular Membrane, that is inserted into the Choroides at its widest part, and is supposed to be connected with the internal changes of the Eye. In all Mammalia, the Globe of the Eye is surround- ed with Fat, which answers the same purpose as in a Human Body.

Part IV.] OF FISHES. S31 Fishes a distinct partition between the Thorax arid Abdomen, but is purely Membranous. The Alimentary Canal is generally very short in this class of Animals, and seldom makes more than one, two, or three turns. In a Pipe Fish, Lamprey^ Trunlc Fish, and many others, it extends almost straight from the Mouth to the Anus. In some there is very little distinction into Stomach and Intestines, but internally the difference is generally marked by the structure, by the Pylorus, and by the Valve of the Colon. In many of the class, the Esophagus is so short and wide, as scarcely to be distinguished from the Stomach; and the Food is frequently found remaining partly in the Esophagus, till that in the Stomach is digested. In Branchiostegi, or Fishes with a Cartilaginous Skeleton and free Branchiae, as a Sturgeon, there is great difference in the form and structure of the inside of the Esophagus. It is beset with strong Combs or Tufts forming a fine Net-work, which distinguishes it from the Stomach. The Stomach of Animals of this class is generally long, and frequently found full of Fishes retaining their natural form, but quite pulpy, digestion being considered to be chiefly effected here by solution. In the Squalus kind, there are numerous large Plicae in the Stomach, running in a longitudinal, or in a transverse direction, or in both. In a Mullet, the Sto- mach is so rough within, that the Animal is enabled to ruminate, and hence is ranked one of the Spurious Ruminants. The Intestines, in this class, vary still more than in the former, particularly with respect to the distinction

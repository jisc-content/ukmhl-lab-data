Part II.] OF BIRDS. 205 v^rse Process. The Sternal Extremity has an Osseous Appendage supplying the place of Cartilage. The middle of the Rib has a flat Process directed upwards and backwards over the following Rib, each in this manner supporting the other. The number of the Ribs is less than in a Human Body ; they are not found to exceed ten pairs. The Sternum is of great proportional size, covering not only the Breast, but a large part of the^Belly. In- ternally it is concave, externally convex, and is ex- tended below into a ridge termed Crista^ resembling the keel of a ship. This, with the under surface of the Bone in general, serves for the attachment of the very strong Pectoral Muscles, that move the Wings. In some Birds, as an Ostrich and Cassowary^ which have not the power of flying, the Sternum is flat be- low, and there is no Crista. The Wings are connected to the Sternum by three Bones, viz. two Clavicles, and the Furcula, Fork-like Bone, or Merrythought. The Clavicle is articulated with the anterior edge of the Sternum, and has little motion. It is divided into two short processes, one connected to the Purcula, the other to the Scapula, with which it forms a Cavity for the reception of the Humerus. The Furcula is remarkable in Birds, and is seldom wanting. It is in form of a V, common to both Shoulders, and is joined by its point to the most pro- minent part of the Crista of the Sternum, while the other extremities are connected to the Humeral end of the Clavicles, and the point of the Scapulae, where these two Bones are articulated with each other, and with the Os Humeri. The Furcula serves to keep the

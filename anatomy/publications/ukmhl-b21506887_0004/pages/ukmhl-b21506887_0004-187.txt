Part I.J OF MAMMALIA. 183 When relaxed in the sheath, it turns more or less in a waving direction, on account of its length. In most Animals, it is situated under the Abdomen, having on each side one Muscle, which arises from those at the middle of the Abdomen, and is fixed to the Prepuce, and another, arising from the Vertebrae of the Tail, or Muscles about the Anus, and inserted along the Penis, as in Carnivora, or in the sheath that covers it, as in Rummants, The first is the Adductor, and the other the Retractor of the Prepuce. In some Animals, as a Squirrel^ Dormouse, Rat, Marmot, Guinea Pig, Hare, Opossum, Lion, and Ca- mel, the Penis goes to the anterior part of the Pubes, or in some, it passes directly out of the Pelvis, then proceeds to the side of the Anus. Animals of this last kind are termed Retromingents, the Urine being voided backwards in both sexes, and they are, contrary to an ancient opinion, found to copulate forwards, like other Quadrupeds. In Cetacea, the Penis is long and slender, in the form of an J', and is situated within the Abdomen. When they copulate, the Female turns upon her back, and the Male slides on. The length of the Penis varies according to its si- tuation. In the Lion and Cat kind, it is so short that the Male uses his teeth and Claws, to enable him to cling better to the Female during copulation. The form is as variable as the length in this class. It is somewhat cylindrical in the Ape kind and Glires, slender in a Boar and Ruminants, cylindrical in a Horse and Elephant, large and conical in a Porpoise, and large, conical, and flat in a Dolphin,

The Larynx is peculiar in being double, or in there being one at each end of the Trachea. The Superior Larynx is situated at the root of the Tongue and top of the Trachea, and is composed of several Osseous Pieces, the largest of which is analogous to the Cricoid Cartilage. There are neither Thyroid nor Arytenoid Cartilages, nor Epiglottis, in Birds. The Rima GloUidis is a simple Chink or slit, with Muscular sides, which can merely open and close the passage, having no connexion with the formation of Voice. In place of the Epiglottis, there are, in many Birds, Cartilaginous Papillae upon the edge of the Glottis, to prevent the Aliment from going into the Lungs. In an Ostrich^ there is a slight elevation, which some have considered as an Epiglottis. T he Trachea is composed of Cartilages or of Bone, which form complete rings, and these overlap each other at their edges in such a manner, that the diame- ter of the Tube is not affected by any twisting of the Neck. Its form is commonly cylindrical, sometimes co- I

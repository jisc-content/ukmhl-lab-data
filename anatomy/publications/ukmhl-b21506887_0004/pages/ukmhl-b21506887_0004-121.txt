Part I.] OF MAMMALIA. 117 large, and here the Submaxillary and Sublingual open each by a distinct Duct at the Fraenum Linguae. The Parotid exists in all Quadrupeds, except in some of the Ant-eaters^ and Seals. In the former Animals, the want is supplied by the Submaxillary, which ap- pears to be increased in size. In Seals, the Sublin- gual and Parotid Glands are wanting. In Glires, the Salivary Glands are of considerable size. The Parotid, in a Rabbit, embraces the Concha of the Ear, and extends as far as the Submaxillary. The Parotid Duct, in Glires, crosses the upper part of the Masseter, and perforates the Mouth opposite the last superior Molaris. The Duct of the Submax- illary has no Papilla at its termination upon the side of the Fraenum Linguae. In some of the Porcupine Ant-eaters, the Parotid is smaller than the Submaxillary ; the latter is extended in the Neck. The Sublingual is long and narrow, and the Molar Glands are united into a mass under the Buccinator. The Salivary Glands, in Camivora, are smaller than in Glires, little mastication being required by this set of Animals. The Parotid is commonly not larger than the Submaxillary, and is often of an inferior size, as in a Dog. In this Animal, and in a Cat, the Parotid is of a crescentic form, and embraces the Concha of the Ear, extending as far as the Submax- lary. In a Cat, the Sublingual Gland is wanting, and in a Dog^ appears little more than a prolongation of the Submaxillary. The Amphibious Quadrupeds which are of the Car-

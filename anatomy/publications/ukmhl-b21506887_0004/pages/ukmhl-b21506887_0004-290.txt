Cartilaginous Rings, though with some exceptions, as in a Crocodile^ Chameleon, and Seyyents, In these last, it has the appearance of being a complete Carti- laginous tube. The proportion of the Bronchi, compared to the Trachea, is as in Birds; but in Serpents, there are large dilatations. In some of the Turtle and Crocodile kind, the Bron- chi form convolutions; and in some, the Trachea di- vides so soon, as to appear to be double. In most other Reptiles, the Bronchi are very short. For the most part, the Bronchi do not divide, and commonly do not enter into the Substance of the Lungs, but terminate abruptly in them by one or more large orifices. The Lungs here, as in Birds, are in the same com- mon Cavity with the other Viscera, but vary more in shape and size than in the two former classes. They form most frequently two oval Sacs, which, in the Turtle kind, extend by the sides of the Spine, as far as the Pelvis, and above all the other Viscera. They differ from those of Birds by the greater size of their Cells, and the looseness of their texture. In a Tuitle, they are more complicated than in the rest of the individuals of this class, approaching more in their structure to the Lungs of Birds. The Branches of the Bronchi communicate, each by an orifice, with a particular Sac, the walls of which form Polygonal Cells, varying according to the kind of the Animal. In a Crocodile, the Cells are smaller than in a Turtle, In Lizards, Frogs, and Serpents, the Lungs have, at

Part 1.1 OF MAMMALIA. 47 The Pelvis is narrower in proportion, and has less of the bason appearance, in the whole of this Class, than it has in Man, the Ape tribe not excepted. In some the Ossa Ischia are so long, as to have the Acetabulum almost in the centre of the Ossa Innomi- nata. In the species of Apes which are frequently in a sitting posture, there are broad and flat Tuberosities belonging to the Ossa Ischia. .-I'iib'i 'io The Ossa Ilia of the order Bradypoda^ are somewhat of a prismatical form ; the Sloth, Armadillo, and some others, have the Tuberosities of the Ischia so much ap- proximated, that the Ischiatic Notches are converted into a complete Foramen. In the Ant-eaters, on the contrary, the Ossa Pubis are at a distance from each other, as in Birds. In the Glires, the Abdominal Surface of the Ossa Ilia is turned towards the Spine. They are concave exter- nally, and in some are of a prismatical form. A Beaver and a Kanguroo have the Ossa Pubis joined together by an Accretion of Substance. A Marmot, Kanguroo, and Opossum, are remarkable in the diminu- tive size of the Brim of the Pelvis, and proportional magnitude of the Foramen Thyroideum ; but still more so on account of two long narrow flat Bones, articulated with the Ossa Pubis; these give origin to particular Muscles in Females for supporting the Pouch that contains the Young. They are also said to belong to a Male ; at least to some of the Species. Marsupial Bones have also been found in the Ormthorrynchus, or Duck-billed Animal. The Fera; have the Abdominal Surface of the Ossa Ilia turned towards the Spine. They are nearly as

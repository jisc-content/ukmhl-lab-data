332 OF THE ALIMENTARY CANAL [Part IV. between small and great. Sometimes the diameter of the two is the same, though differing in structure. Sometimes the difference in size is inverted, the upper being larger than the under portion of the Canal. Sometimes the Coats of the upper are thicker than those of the under part of the Gut. In the greater number of Cartilaginous Fishes, as a Raja and Squaliis^ where the Canal is remarkably short, but is considerably dilated near the Stomach, the surface of the Gut internally is extended by longi- tudinal Spiral Valves. In a Sturgeon, the inner side of the Intestine forms a curious laminated Plexus and Fossulas, which are co- vered with small Glands. In a Frog-fish and Sea- Wolf, there is a lozenged appearance. In a Turbot, the inner side of the Gut has many fringed Laminae. In the Skate tribe, there is a kind of Caecum, or Ap- pendix Vermiformis, between the small and great In- testines, but none in Fishes with Osseous Skeletons^ In these the Gut is surrounded, at its origin, by small blind Appendices, or Intestinula Caeca, which open upon it. They are sometimes long and slender, at other ti^nes thick and short, or simple, or ramified ; the number varying from 1 to 150 and upwards, and even in different species of the same Genus. They are found in all the Osseous Fishes, with few exceptions, as a Pike, and secrete a fluid useful in digestion. In Cartilaginous Fishes, as a Skate, in place of these, there is a Glandular Body, which has been com- pared to the Pancreas of warm-blooded Animals. The Intestines, in Fishes strictly so called, terminate

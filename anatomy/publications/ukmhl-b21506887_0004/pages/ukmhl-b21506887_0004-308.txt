[Part IV. 004 OF THE MUSCLES The spaces between the Ribs are occupied by Mus- cles somewhat similar to the Intercostals; but the Ribs are also affected by the large lateral Muscles of the Body, which are likewise fixed to them. In the great- er number of Fishes there are no Muscles peculiar to the motions of the Head, this being done chiefly by the Lateral Muscles of the Body. The Fins on the under part of the Body, are moved in various directions by small Muscles peculiar to them- selves. Those in the Back have Muscles in pairs, placed before and behind the Fins ; one pair passing from the Nape of the Neck to the Fin, another lying between the Fin and the Tail. Where there are two Dorsal Fins, there is an additional pair of Muscles placed between them. In a Raja, there are Muscles for moving the Head upon the Body, and others by which the Snout is mov- ed upon the Head. A Shate has two thick beds of Muscles on the Body, one placed above, and another below; and these are formed into numerous Fasciculi, which, like the Cartilaginous parts of the Fins, have a radiated appearance.

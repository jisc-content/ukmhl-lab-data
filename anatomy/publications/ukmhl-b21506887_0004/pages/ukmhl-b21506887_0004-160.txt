156 OF THE INTESTINES. [Part I. OF THE INTESTINES. 0, the Intestines in general.â€”The Intestines are in general longer in Mammalia than in the other classes of Animals. In Birds, Reptiles, and Fishes, they gra- dually become shorter, till at last they scarcely equal the length of the Body. The proportional length varies exceedingly in different Quadrupeds. In some, as a Ram, they are found to be twenty-eight times the length of the Animal; in others, on the contrary, as in certain Species of Bats, they are only twice as long as the Body. The length of the Canal corresponds with the Food upon which the Animal is accustomed to live. It is ge- nerally shorter in Carnivorous than in Herbivorous Animals; but to this rule there are exceptions. A Seal, which is a Carnivorous Animal, has a very long Intestinal Canal; a Sloth, on the contrary, has a very short one, though it feeds upon vegetables.

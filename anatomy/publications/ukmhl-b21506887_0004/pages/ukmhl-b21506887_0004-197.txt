The Corpora Lutea are found after impregnation, and, in a Cow in particular, are large and of a yellow colour; but in other Animals, the colour varies ac- cording to the kind. The Muscular Fibres in the Gravid Uterus become less distinct than in the unimpregnated state. The changes of the simple Uterus without Horns, or that belonging to the Ape tribe, &c. considerably resemble those in Women. In a Uterus with Horns, the changes are according to the number of Foetuses the Mother carries. In Uniparous Animals, as a Mare, the Foetus is confined to the Uterus. In a Cow, it extends from the Uterus to one of the Cornua. In Multiparous Animals, one or more Foetuses are contained in each Horn; in which last case, the Cornua, by their alternate contractions and dilatations, are formed into Cells. The Uterus Anfractuosus has the thinnest Coats of any, and suffers the least change by Impregnation. In a Kanguroo after Impregnation; the communication between the Vagina and Lateral Canals is completely shut up by inspissated Mucus. A minute orifice is describ- ed as being now close to the Urethra, and communicat- ing with the Uterus, though no opening is found here in the Virgin state. This, dilating at the time of par- turition, is found to discharge the Foetus into the Pouch or False Belly; the parts, after delivery, re- turning to their original state. In an Opossum, the changes by Impregnation are not yet ascertained. VOL. IV. N

OF THE BRAIN, &c. [Part IV. 310 from Tubercles behind the Cerebellum, which, in a Rqja^ are remarkable for their great size. Each di- vides into three Branches, as well as in a Human Body ; and these go to the outer part of the Nose, to the sides of the Mouth, and to the Face in general. In a Skate, the third Branch vanishes suddenly upon the Mucous Ducts which issue, as from a centre, at the outer and back part of the Eye. The Sia^th Pair is dis- tributed as in other red-blooded Animals. Of the Seventh Pair, the Portio Dura is large in Cartilaginous Fishes, and comes off from the Brain quite distinct from the Auditory Nerve. The Portio Mollis lies so near the Fifth Pair, as to appear to be a Branch of that Nerve. In Cartilaginous Fishes, as a SJcate, it passes into the Ear by a single Foramen; in the Osseous kind, as a Cod, where the Ear is in the same Cavity with the Brain, the Nerve is dispersed directly upon that Organ. The Eighth Pair is remarkable on account of its great size, and its distribution. It is divided into three portions, one of which runs directly to the Branchiae. The second goes to the Muscles of the Tongue, and to the Esophagus. The third is a large Nerve, which extends under the Skin as far as the Tail Fin, upon which it terminates. The Ninth Pair ap- pears to be wanting. The Great Sympathetic Nerve is also found here, but extremely slender. It unites with the Vertebral Nerves, but this, like the other Nerves of Fishes, has no visible Ganglia, excepting those al- ready taken notice of in the Olfactory Pair in certain Fishes, as a Gadus, he. The Spinal Marrow, in the Animals of this class, is remarkable for its great size when compared with the

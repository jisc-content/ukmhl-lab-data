Part IX.] OF ZOOPHYTES. 385 In an Echinus^ there is a Set of Tubes, considered by the late De Monro as Absorbents, which have a visible Muscular structure, and without Valves. The outer end of each of the Tubes has a flat plate ; by these the Ani- mal adheres when it fixes upon any object. In the middle of the plate is an orifice, which imbibes the sea-water, that is conducted to Vessels in the inner part of the Shell. Each of the Ducts perforates the Shell by two Foramina; and the different Foramina are placed in five pairs of parallel lines, called by Natu- ralists ^m6?/Zacra, from their similarity to alleys in a garden. Upon the inner side of the Shell, the Ducts run to two ranges of Laminae, composed of Plexus of Vessels, from each of which a Duct goes to a large Tube, which receives all the Absorbents of one of the double ranges. The large Tube terminates in Reser- voirs over the Sockets of the Teeth, through which it is supposed, that after a secretion has been made, the fluid absorbed is returned to the sea. In a Medusa Rhizostomes, and Coriaceous Polypi, the Vessels which carry the nourishment come direct- ly or indirectly from the Stomach. In a Hydra, or Polypus with simple Arms, no Ves- sels are observed; they imbibe their nourishment by means of the Pores of their Gelatinous covering ; and even when their Body is inverted, their external, now becoming an internal surface, is found to digest their Food equally well with the other. Monades, Protees, and other Microscopical Animals, are found to be the most simple of any, appearing to be mere Gelatinous Masses, destitute of Mouth and Stomach, and receiving their nourishment through VOL.

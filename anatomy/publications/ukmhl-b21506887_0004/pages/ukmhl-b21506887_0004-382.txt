Their Vascu- lar Skin supplies the place of Branchiae; but in the other Genera there is a subdivision of the Blood-vessels in the form of a Tuft, which may answer a similar purpose. In some, as an Aphrodite^ there are little Crests, like those of a Cock, placed above each Tuber- cle, carrying Spines. In all these Animals, the Branchiae are provided with Arteries and Veins, as in the higher classes, and here Respiration is considered to be performed by the Vascular System. In Hydatids there is nothing like a Vascular System. , Intestinal Canal.â€”A Lumbricus Terrestris has but one long Canal, destitute of a Mesentery, divided by several Partitions ; the anterior dilatations forming a sort of Stomach. In a Leech, this Canal runs from one end of the Body to another, and is divided into many Cells. In some Worms, as a Taenia and Fasciola Hepatica, the Esophagus serves as an Aorta, conveying nourish- ment to the other parts of the Body. In a Taenia Solium, or common Tape-worm, which is composed of a chain of Quadrangular Joints, there is an Orifice, in one of the margins of each articulation. This has been considered by most Authors as a Mouth, and by a few, as Bloch, &c. is regarded as a Vagina. It is sometimes in the one Margin, or sometimes in the other, without observing any particular order. From this Orifice a Canal goes off, which runs along the mar- gin of each Joint, and communicates with its fellow at the extremity of each articulation. A Canal is also seen in some Tcenia, proceeding from an Orifice in the middle

This is com- posed of a horny covering, similar in its structure and formation to the Hooves of Ruminants ; but it incloses the whole Bone. The internal surface is formed into numerous Laminae, which have intermediate Layers of Vascular matter for their nourishment. In the inferior part of the Hoof, there is a soft matter full of Nerves, and very sensible when punctured. Besides the parts mentioned above, there are others connected with the Common Integuments, destined for the secretions of peculiar fluids. These occur in cer- tain Genera and Species belonging to particular classes of Animals. In the Temple of an Elephant is a Gland, from which a Duct runs downwards and forwards, and ter- minates half way between the Eye and Ear ; through this, in both Sexes, but more especially in a Male, a brownish liquor is discharged upon the Skin at rutting-time. In a Deer, Antelope, and Hare, are Membranous Sacs, with Follicles opening into them, placed in a Sub- orbitar Fossa of the Superior Maxillary Bone. From these a Viscid, Adipose, dark Fluid is discharged through a clift in the Skin. This liquor was formerly supposed to have some relation to Tears. In the substance of the Prepuce of the Glans of the Penis and Clitoris, in many of the Glires and Carnivo- ra, as a Rat, Lion, Civet, &c. are two sets of Glands, termed Preputial, one consisting of simple Follicles, the other of Conglomerate Glands. Each sends out a Duct, which discharges a Sebaceous matter, to defend VOL. IV. r .

78 [Part I. OF THE INTEGUMENTS. The colour of the Hair is for the most part nearly the same with that of the Corpus Mucosum ; but the colour is observed to reside under the Cuticular Cover- ing, and not in the Pith or Medulla. Some of the larger Bristles, as the Whiskers of a Cat^ have a small Canal internally, while the Prickles of a Hedge- hog, and Quills of a Porcupine, are furrowed on the surface, and are filled with a white substance internally. In some Animals, as a Sheep, the Skin is covered with Wool in place of Hairs ; in a Martin, Ermine, &c. with a silky stuff, which forms the furs; or in a Pig, with Bristles ; or in a Hedge-hog, with Spines or Quills; or in an Armadillo, with hard Plates laid like tiles on a roof, &c. Animals are commonly born with Hairs upon them, though in some they are not observ- ed till a certain period of life, and then only on certain parts of the Body. The Hairs in Mammalia have nearly the same component parts, and grow in the same manner, as in Man. The Horns are found chiefly on the Heads of Rumi- nants, though on particular parts of the Body in many other Animals. They are commonly formed on Processes of the Frontal Bone, and grow from the base at an early period of life. The Skin of the part which, by its protrusion, is afterwards to form the Horn, becomes callous, then gradually changes into Horn. In some, as an Ooc, the Horns are round; in others, as a Sheep, they are flat, and they form different cur- vatures according to the kind. Between the process of Bone and the Horn covering it, a soft Vascular Sub- stance is interposed, which, while it nourishes the out-

OF THE ORGANS OF VOICE AND RESPIRATION: The Larynx of Reptiles, like the superior Larynx in Birds, is composed of different pieces ; but the appear- ance varies in different kinds of Reptiles, and some- times in the different sexes of the same Species. There is no Inferior Larynx in this class. Reptiles have neither Epiglottis nor Papillae, though, in a Crocodile^ there are the rudiments of the former. The Larynx of a Crocodile has five Cartilages enter- ing into its composition. The Glottis is purely Mem- branous. The Ligaments of the Glottis are present in all the Animals of the class, but they have neither Lips nor Palatum MoUe, and in general no voice. A Tortoise, several Lizards, and Serpents, can only blow. The Frog tribe, especially in the time of their amours, are enabled to croak, or, when in pain upon being wounded, they sometimes make a sharp squeaking noise, having a Larynx adapted to these purposes, the vocal Ligaments and Ventricles of the Laryhx being of great proportional size. The Males of some species of Frogs have one or two Sacs, either in the Throat or Cheeks, which they inflate, in time of copulation, by means of a Foramen near the chink of the Larynx, opening into each of the Sacs. Here, also, the Rima Glottidis is larger, and the Trachea longer, than in a Female. The Trachea, in Reptiles in general, is formed of

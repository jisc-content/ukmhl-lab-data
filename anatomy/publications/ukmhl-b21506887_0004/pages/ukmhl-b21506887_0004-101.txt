Part I.] OF MAMMALIA. 97 It has not yet been ascertained, what sort of Optic Nerve and Retina those Animals have, as a Marmot and Typhlus^ or Blind Rat^ which it is said possess only a rudinlent of eyes, and have not the power of perceiving light. The Foramen Centrale, or spot seen in the Retina near the axis of a Human Eye, has been observed in several of the Ape tribe, where the Eyes are placed nearly in the same direction as in Man. Here the Fo- ramen has a zone in form of a star. In an Ox and Sheep, in place of this appearance, there is a semi-trans- parent tube, resembling a Lymphatic vessel, terminat- ing in the Vitreous Humour. The Lens, in all Quadrupeds, is divided into two spherical segments; the posterior is generally the more convex of the two. In Man, the Lens is found to be proportionally among the least, and it is also the flattest. Of all other Mammalia, Blumenbach found it proportionally the greatest in an Opossum, and the least in a Whale. In some Quadrupeds, it is of a much rounder form than in a Human Body. In Cetacea, it is nearly spherical. The proportion of the axis to the diameter has been observed to be, in Man and the Ape tribe, as 1 to 2; in a Dog, as 7 to 9 ; in a Horse, as 2 to 3 ; in an Ox, as 5 to 8 ; and in a Whale, as 13 to 15. The other Humours of the Eye have nothing particular in them. The pro- portion of the axis of the three Humours, Aqueous, Crystalline, and Vitreous, after the parts had been frozen, the length of the axis being considered the unit, are in Man, /j, M ^ in a Dog, ^\ ; in VOL.

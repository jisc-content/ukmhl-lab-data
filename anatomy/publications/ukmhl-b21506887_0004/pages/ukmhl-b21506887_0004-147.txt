Part I.] OF MAMMALIA. 14B ly any vocal organs; others, as a Jlaty have them more distinct. In FercB^ the Bear tribe have a singular Larynx. The Cuneiform Cartilages are in form of stilets^ with the posterior extremities on the outside of the Aryte- noid Cartilages. A Kanguroo has the Arytenoid Cartilages remark- ably large, but neither Ventricles nor Ligaments of the Glottis. There is a great difference in the structure of the La- rynx among Feroe. The Dog tribe has a triangular Epiglottis, and large Cuneiform Cartilages projecting outwards, with distinctly marked vocal Ligaments. The Ventricles of the Larynx, in these Animals, are two deep chinks, opening, not into the cavity of the Larynx, but towards the surface of the Epiglottis. The opening between the Epiglottis and Arytenoid Carti- lages, is in form of any! A Cat ha^s two Membranes under the Posterior Li- gaments of the Glottis, which are considered as the cause of the purring noise peculiar to that Animal. In a Cat^ Lion, Tiger, and other Animals of tfiis family, the Superior or Anterior Ligaments appear to be the vocal; the Ventricles are wanting. A Horse has no anterior Ligaments of the Glottis, nor Ventricles strictly so called, but a Falciform Mem- brane, attached by its middle to the Thyroid Cartilage, while its extremities run along the external edges of the Rima Glottidis. This structure is considered as the cause of neighing in that Animal. Before the vocal Ligaments there is a large passage in each side, some- thing in the form of a Ventricle, leading to a great Sac,

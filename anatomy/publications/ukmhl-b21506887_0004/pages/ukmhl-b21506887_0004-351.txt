This Body they can protrude or retract, so as to fix themselves to solid substances, or drag themselves along the sand. This substance is termed the Beard, and is exemplified in a FresJi-water Muscle, where it is situated under and near the fore part of the Shell. By means of the Beard, the Animal has sometimes been observed to move to the distance of some yards in a few hours. An Oyster Scallop, and several others with unequal Shells, have no Foot, and are therefore deprived of lo- comotion.

The former of these functions is performed by seizing, with its point, the Gluten, which is furnished by a Gland situated at its base. It draws this out into threads, and, while still soft, it attaches them to the rock, &c. to which the Animal is to be fixed. The Nervous System exists in most of the Animals of this class, and consists of a Brain placed upon the Esophagus, and of Nerves. In the Sepia, the Brain is contained in a Cartilagi- nous Covering belonging to the Head, and has con- nected with it a kind of Medullary Collar, inclosed in a semicircular Canal, which gives passage to the E- sophagus. From the Collar, Nerves are sent off* to the diff'erent parts of the Body. Some of consider- able size go to the Tentacula; two Optic Nerves per-

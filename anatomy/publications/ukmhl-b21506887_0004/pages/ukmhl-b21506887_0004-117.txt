Part I.j OF MAMMALIA. 113 Sacs, lined with a black Mucous Skin, which is the con- tinuation of the Common Integuments, and covered externally by a strong Muscular Expansion that arises from the Cranium. They have a common opening ex- ternally, by a narrow chink in form of a crescent. The water taken in by the Mouth, and which, in Fishes, is thrown out at the opening of the Gills, is here pre- vented from being swallowed, by the contraction of the Pharynx. This elevates the Valves, and distends the Sacs, from which the fluid is forcibly discharged to a great height by the surrounding Muscular Fibres. The Nares and Spiracula, in Cetacea, occupy the place which, in the other Aninials of this Class, forms the Nose. This Organ, and the Sinuses of the Head, are wanting in the Whale tribe. VOL. IV. H

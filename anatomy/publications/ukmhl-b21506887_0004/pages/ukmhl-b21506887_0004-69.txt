This difference is most remarkable in the Recti of Carnivora, which often extend as far as the Anterior Extremity of the Sternum. In such cases the Pyra- midales are frequently wanting. Muscles of the Parts of Generation,—see Articles Parts of Generation. Muscles situated within the Cavity of the Abdomen.— The Fleshy part of the Diaphragm is generally broad- er in proportion, and it has mo*re extensive motion than in Man, not being so firmly united to the Pericardium. The Quadratus Lumborum, PsoasParvus, Psoas Mag- nus, andlliacus Internus, are present inmost Quadru- peds. They differ only in proportion, which depends upon the number of the Vertebrae of the Loins, and the length of the Ossa Ilia. Muscles situated upon the Iriferior and Lateral Parts of the Thorax.—The Pectoralis Major is for the most part proportionally larger than in Man, and is divided into several portions, giving in some measure the ap- pearance of as many distinct Muscles. In Carnivora, the insertion of the Muscle extends as far as the under part of the Humerus, The Pectoralis Minor in Carni- vorous Animals and Ruminants, is wanting ; but in a Horse, its place is supplied by another Muscle, though this is so connected with the Pectoralis Major, as to go partly to the Humerus. The Subclavius, in the Ape tribe, is as in Man; in Mammalia without Clavicles, it is wanting. The Serratus Magnus is more extensive in the Infe- rior Mammalia than in Man, being attached not only • VOL. IV. E

[Part I, OF THE EYE. 90 In some of the Glires, as a Hare and Rabbit, and in Carnivora, Solipeds, Ruminants, Belluce, and Ce- tacea^ there is a real Pigmentum Nigrum at the fore part of the Eye ; but at the Back and Temporal Side, the colour is brilliant, and is termed Tapetum Lucidum. This is wanting, however, over the entrance of the Optic Nerve. In a Horse, Goat, and Deer, the Ta- petum is of a silver blue, changing into violet. In an Oa7, it is green, changing into a sky blue; in a Sheep, green; in the Cat kind. Bear, and Dolphin, pale yel- low ; in a Badger, Dog, and Fox, it is blue, changing into white. In general, the paint is brightest in night- watching Animals, the brightness reflecting more light upon the Retina. Wherever the Pigmentum exists in the Eye, it is of a black colour where it lines the fore part of the Choroides and back of the Iris. In some entirely white Animals, as a White Rabbit, White Mouse, &c. there is no paint upon the inner side of the Eye ; in such cases, there is a great degree of redness, owing to the Blood-vessels of the Choroides shining through the Retina and Humours ; where, however, there is the least spot of a dark colour, this is not always observed. The Optic Nerve commonly passes through a Cri- briform part in the bottom of the Eye, and has in ge- neral the same appearance, and same kind of termina- tion, as in a Human Subject. In some Animals, as a Hare and Rabbit, the Nerve goes, without dividing, through the Sclerotis and Choroides, and forms a sort of Cup, from the edges of which the Retina arises, haying Medullary Fibres in it, and these running chiefly in a transverse direction.

m OF THE OMENTUM. [Part I. trary, as a Brown Bear, it does not reach the middle of the Abdomen. The Omentum, in this class of Animals, frequently contains much Fat, and the spaces between the diffe- rent Striae of Fat are composed of the same kind of fine Membrane as in a Human Body ; but the quan- tity of Fat depends greatly on age and manner of living. In Herbivorous Animals, it is generally furnished with more than in Carnivorous ; but in both, the quan- tity depends much upon rest. It is also affected by the season, moderate heat increasing the quantity ; though, on the contrary, in Animals that remain benumbed in winter, the Omentum fs charged with this substance. Many of these, as a Dormouse, a Marmot of the Alps, &c. have, in addition to the Omentum, two fatty Appendices, which cover the Intestines in the lateral parts of the Abdomen; they have likewise a large quan- tity of Subcutaneous Fat, which may also serve as a reservoir of nourishment; but the fatty appendages are absent in some of the Dormice, a Bear, &c. though these Animals are of the same nature with those that have them. Kidneys. The structure of' the Kidneys, in Quadrupeds, is analagous to that in Man ; but they vary, in different Animals, in situation, form, relative thickness of their two substances, and in the number and absence of Pa- pillae and Infundibula. The situation differs from that in a Human Body, in the right being commonly higher, or, strictly speak ^

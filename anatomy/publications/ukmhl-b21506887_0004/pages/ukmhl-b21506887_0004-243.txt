Part IL] OF BIRDS, 2S9 possessing little mobility on accountof their attachment above to the Thorax, which has little motion where they are fixed to it. The rest of the Thorax, however, admits of considerable dilatation, so as to determine the air to the Ceils ; and the double articulation of the Ribs likewise favours this. Inspiration, in Birds, is owing to a dilatation of the Air-Ceils from Muscles acting upon the Thorax; or upon the Lungs, as is observed is such large Birds as the Ostrich and Cassowary, Expiration is produced by a relaxation of the Mus- cles employed in Inspiration ; by the action of Muscles situated over the Air-Cells; and more particularly about the Abdomen, where the Muscles bring the posterior part of the Sternum nearer the Vertebrae; and, ac- cording to some Authors, by the power of the Lungs themselves, as is observed in the larger Birds. 1 he strength of the Voice is in proportion to that of the Aerial Cavities. This facility of modulating it, de- pends upon the mobility of the Muscles which con- tract the Lungs. The difference of voice in different Birds depends upon the proportional length, form, consistence, and mobility of the Rings of the Trachea, The cause of the loss of voice in some Birds, as a Quaily CficJcoo, &c. at certain seasons, is not understood. !

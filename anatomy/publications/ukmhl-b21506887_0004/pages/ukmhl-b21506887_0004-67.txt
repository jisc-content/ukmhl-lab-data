Part L] OF MAMMALIA. 65 Buccinator; the Levator Anguli Oris, termed Molaris^ spread out upon the Buccinator; the Depressor Labii Inferioris; two small Muscles, termed Middle Superior and Middle Iriferior of the Lips ; and the Orbicularis. Muscles of the Lower Jaw.â€”The Temporal Muscle in the Ape kind differs but little from that in a Human Body. In the Ferce, it is much thicker and stronger in proportion to the size of the Animal, cor- responding with the hard substances the Teeth have to divide. In the Glires, the Muscle is less extensive than in the former; but in some of the Mat kind, the Muscle is so extensive, as almost to meet its fellow on the op- posite side of the Head. The Masseter agrees with the Temporal Muscle in being thick and strong, corresponding with the force required in bringing the Jaws together. Besides the Muscles mentioned above, and which are common to Quadrupeds in general, many of the Glires, as a Squirrel, Rat, &c. have a fifth pair, for assisting in the elevation of the Under Jaw. Each takes its ori- gin from the Upper Jaw, near the Infra-orbitar Fora- men, and is fixed to the Lower Jaw near the Pterygoi- deus Externus. The Pterygoid Muscles only vary in size and length, and in the obliquity of their Fibres, corresponding with the size and form of the Jaw. The Digastric, in the Jjpe tribe only, possesses two distinct Fleshy Bellies, and a middle Tendon, perfo- rating the Stylo-hyoid Muscle. Among the Ferce, there is only one Belly, and it runs forward to be fixed to the Base of the Lower Jaw, most frequently a little beyond the Masseter.

Part I.] OF MAMMALIA. 175 Among Glires, it is proportionally large, being from a 12th to a 4th part of the bulk of the Kidney ; while, in Ferce, it is in general not more than a 20th or a 50th part. The form, also, of this substance is very various. In Solipeds and Ruminants, it is often round, or cylindri- cal, or conical. In many Animals, its external appear- ance is very similar to that of the Kidney. In Cetacea, it is divided into numerous Lobules, which have ge- nerally two distinct substances, the outer yellowish, the inner a deep brown, and softer than the outer. The external is often more than half the thickness of the Gland ; but the colour and distinction of substance vary much in different Animals. In some, as an Ele- phant, this is scarcely observed; in others, as in some of the Glires, three or more substances of different co- lours have been found. Bladder. All Mammalia have a Bladder of Urine, but it is more loose than in Man, and is completely covered by the Peritoneum. The shape is also different; the bot- tom, or Fundus, on account of the horizontal situation of the Animal, being most dependent, becomes the widest part. In Herbivorous Animals, particularly in Pecora, the Bladder is much larger, and more dilat- able, but less thick and strong, than in Carnivora ; hence the latter are observed to evacuate the Urine more frequently. The structure of the Bladder varies in these two kinds of Animals. In Carnivora, it is commonly com-

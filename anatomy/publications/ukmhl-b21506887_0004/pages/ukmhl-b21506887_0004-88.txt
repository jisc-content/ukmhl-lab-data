These consist chiefly in its being much smaller in proportion to the Body, and also to the Cerebellum and Spinal Marrow, but more particularly to the Nerves arising from it. To this last circumstance there are no exceptions, though there are several to the others. Some of the Jjpe and Mouse kind equal Man in the proportion of the size of the Brain, and certaiti Birds surpass him ; but, according to Soemmerring and Elbe, the size of the Brain, to the Nerves arising from it, bears an exact ratio to the :^aculties of the Ani- mal's mind; and though, in some small Animals, the Brain is proportionally larger to the size of the Body than in Man, yet all, even the Monkey tribe, are far inferior to him in respect to the proportion between the Brain and Nerves.

Organs of Respiration.—The Vessels seen on the sur- face of the Animals of the order Echinodermata^ as an Echinm-, and the soft Gelatinous Zoophytes, as a Medimty are supposed by some Authors to draw in nourishment from without, and to serve also as a sort of Respiratory Organs; but these are circumstances not yet fully ascer- tained. Fresh-water Polypi, or Zoophytes strictly so call- ed, imbibe nourishment through their whole surface. Of the order Infusoria, or Animalcula of InfusimSf heir diminutive size renders it impossible to ascertain any thing about their nature. Alimentary Canal and Cavity.—-In some of the indi- viduals of the class, there is an Alimentary Canal be- ginning by a Mouth, and terminating by an Anus. In others there is a Sac, simple or complex. In the first, the Canal is sustained by a Mesentery, which fixes it to tbe walls or covering of the Animal, as in Echinodermata, where, in some of these, as an Echinus and Holothuria, it makes turns within the Body, and ends in the Anus; in others, as a Sipuncuhis, it is a simple Canal; and in an Asterias, a Sac in the centre of the Animal, from which two Canals extend into each of the Branches. In some of the others, as a Medusa, the Alimentary Canal is not suspended by the Mesentery, but is a common Cavity in the general mass. The Stomach occupies the part termed Pedicle. From this Cavity Vessels arise, which convey the nou^ rishment to the different parts of the Body. In some of the Mcdn-scv^ there is a simple oi^ening ; in others,

Part L] OF MAMMALIA. 57 quisite purpose of embracing and climbing the Trunks and Branches of Trees. Metatarsus.—The structure of the Metatarsus is in ge- neral the same with that of the Metacarpus. The Ape tribe have the Metatarsal Bone of the Great Toe only about half the length of the others, but it can be readi- ly separated to some distance from them. Solipeds and 'Ruminants have a single Metatarsal or Canon Bone of the Hind Leg, which, in the former Genus, and some- times in the latter, has a small Styloid Bone on each side. Toes.—In Apes^ the smaller Toes are longer than in Man. The Phalanges are much of the same nature with the corresponding parts of the Anterior Extre- mities. The Great Toe is shorter than the rest, but the Me- tatarsal Bone can move like the Thumb, in opposing the other Toes when the Animal is climbing trees, &c. The same thing takes place in the Genus Opossum^ but this structure is only in the Posterior Extremity. In Carnivora in general, the Great Toe is united with and parallel to the rest. A Bear, Badger, and Mole, have it nearly equal to the length of the other Toes. In a Dog, Cat, and Hare, it is almost obliterated. An Elephant has five perfect Toes, a Pig four. Solipeds have one perfect Toe, and two imperfect, articulated with a single Metatarsal Bone. Ruminants have two perfect Toes, and two small ones, attached to the under part of a Metatarsal Bone. Cetacea have no Bones in the Tail Fins, which correspond to the Posterior Extremities of Quadrupeds. In Claxoed Animals, the Phalanges of the Toes of the

Part VI.] OF CRUSTACEA. 359 Brain is divided above into four Lobes, from which a pair of Optic Nerves are sent off. Four Nerves pass to the four Antennae and adjacent parts. From the posterior part of the Brain Nerves go off, which form a Collar round the Esophagus. The different Nerves form Ganglia, which supply more particularly the se- veral Muscles. In the Lobster kind in general, the Eye is placed on a moveable Tubercle, and is somewhat conical. When magnified, it presents different Facets, which are hard and transparent, representing *so many Corneas. Lin- ing these, there is an opaque Pigment, which appears to leave no aperture for the passage of the light. At a little distance from the Corneae, is a dark-coloured Membrane, considered as the Choroides, which has a production of the Optic Nerve on its anterior, as well as its posterior surface, and therefore forming a sort of double Betina. But how the light can act upon the bottom of the Eye through the opaque lining of the Cornea,—and whether these Animals, from the compound nature of their Eyes, see objects multiplied or single,—are circumstances not understood. The Ear^ in a Lobster, is a small Sac inclosed in a scaly cylinder. At the base of the Antennae, the Nerves pass through this cylinder into 4he Sac, the opposite extremity of which is inclpsed by an elastic Membrane analogous to the Membrana Tympani, or the Fenestra Ovalis, and is observed at the bottom of the large Antennae. Organ of Smell.—None is found in any of the Crus- tacea, though many Authors have been of opinion that

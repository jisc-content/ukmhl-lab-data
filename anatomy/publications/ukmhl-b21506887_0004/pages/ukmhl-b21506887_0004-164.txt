OF THE INTESTINES. [Part L 160 dent than in Man. The Papillae are very distinct up- on the inner side of the Intestines in many Mammalia. In a Seal, they are remarkably conspicuous, and are found through the whole length of the posterior extre- mity of the small Intestine. Of, the Intestines in particular.â€”In the Ape kind, the Intestinal Canal bears a strong resemblance to that of Man; but the whole of them, except Ourangs, want the Appendix Vermiformis. Bradypoda have the Canal of a moderate length, most of the Animals of this class being of the Carnivo- rous kind. A Sloth, on the contrary, living on vege- tables, is remarkable for the shortness of the Intestines. In an Ornithorrynchus, the structure of the Intestines differs from that in other Mammalia. There are many transverse Plicae,resembling those in Fishes ; the Cae- cum is in form of an Appendix Vermiformis ; the Co- lon enlarges towards its outer extremity, forming a Cloaca, as in Birds. It has many Sinuosities in the right Hypochondrium ; and upon the inner Membrane, Plicae run in a longitudinal direction. ThejBa^ tribe, though Carnivorous, have a Cellular Colon and a large Caecum. They have the Intestinal Canal the shortest of any of the Quadrupeds, being on- ly once and a half, or twice the length of the Body. In a Vespertilio VampyruSy on the contrary, or Rousette, which lives on vegetables, it is proportionally longer than in a Human Body. Among Glires or Rodentia, which feed upon vege- tables, the Intestines are from six to sixteen times the length of the Body ; but their diameter is not very con-

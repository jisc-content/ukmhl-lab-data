SM OF THE HEART, &c. [Part IV. lining of the Thoracic Cavity. The Heart, as in Frogs, consists of a single Auricle and a Ventricle, which correspond with the right side of the Heart of warm-blooded Animals. The Auricle is commonly larger than the Ventricle, but thinner in its walls. It receives the Blood from the Body, and sends it to the Ventricle, in the Mouth of which there are Valves, which vary in number in diiferent Fishes. The Ven- tricle is sometimes round, at other times triangular, but more frequently of a tetragonal form. Its sides are generally thick, and have Columnae Carneae run- ning in different directions. It opens first into a Bulb or Pedicle, which is very conspicuous in a Cod and Salmon, where it is of a pyramidal form. In a Shate, it has a cylindrical appearance. In this Animal and a Sturgeon, there are Valves at the entry, and also at the further Extremity of the Bulb. In a Cod, Sal- mon, he. the Valves are only at its origin. Principal Blood-vessels.â€”The distribution of the Blood-vessels differs considerably from that of the Animals of the preceding classes. They have a smaller proportion of red, but a much greater number of colourless Vessels. The Branchial Artery is conti- nued from the Bulb, and is entirely spent upon the Gills. In ^ Skate, it advances under the Cartilage which unites the inferior extremities of the Branchial Arches, and soon gives off a Branch to each side, that subdivides into three others, to be dispersed upon a corre- sponding number of Posterior Branchise. The Trunk afterwards proceeds till it gets opposite to the two Anterior Branchiae, and then divides into a

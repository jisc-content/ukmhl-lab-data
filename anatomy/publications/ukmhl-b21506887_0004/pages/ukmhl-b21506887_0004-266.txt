OF THE BONES [Part III. S63 to the first Digit, two to the second and third Digits, and three to the fourth and fifth. In the Lizard tribe, the Cranium, or at least the ca- vity for the Brain, is uncommonly small. In a Croco- dile that measures between twice and thrice the length of a Human Body, the cavity of the Cranium is only about three inches long, and the third part of that in breadth ; and in a Chameleon, it is not found larger than a common pea. A Crocodile has a single Parietal Bone, but both in that Animal and a Lizard, numerous pieces enter into the composition of the Lower Jaw, which is pro- portionally larger in the former Animal than in any other creature. The two Intermaxillary Bones form the end of the Maxilla Superior, and surround the nos- trils. The Under Jaw corresponds with that of other Animals of the class, in having an Articular Cavity for receiving a Condyle of the Temporal Bone. An uncommon structure is observed in the Teeth, which consist of two sets, one contained within the other, which is found to facilitate their change. The Head is joined to the Atlas by a single Condyle. Lizards have perfect Ribs, of which there are twelve pairs in a Crocodile, but the Sternum is in a great measure Cartilaginous. This Animal is remarkable in having a double Sternum, one belonging to the Thorax, and another extending along the Abdomen as far as the Pubes. There are Seven Cervical Vertebrae here, but the five last are found to be so encased, that the Animal cannot turn the Neck laterally. The Sacral Vertebrae are joined into one piece in all the Animals of this

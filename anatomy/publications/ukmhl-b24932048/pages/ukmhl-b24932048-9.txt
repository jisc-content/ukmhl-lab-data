TO THE RIGHT HON. THE LORD PROVOST, THE MAGISTRATES, AND COUNCILLORS OF THE CITY OF EDINBURGH, PATRONS OF THE UNIVERSITY. Anderson’s University, Glasgow, 10th February, 1840". My Lord Provost and Gentlemen, I beg most respectfully to refer you to my note of the 3d instant, informing you of my intention to offer myself as a Candidate for the Chair of Anatomy about to become vacant by the resignation of Dr. Monro. At present I submit for your perusal a few Testimonials from gentlemen well qualified to give an opinion of my professional character, and ability to fulfil the duties of the above situation, and I shall add a few more previous to the day of election. I am a Graduate of your University—a Member of the Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons of this city—have acted for ten years as one of the Surgeons to the Royal Infirmary —and delivered five courses of Lectures on Clinical Surgery in that Institution. Since 1830, I have been a Lecturer on Anatomy; first in the Portland-Street Medical School, and afterwards in this University; having been unanimously elected by the Trustees on the unsolicited recommendation of the Medical Professors.

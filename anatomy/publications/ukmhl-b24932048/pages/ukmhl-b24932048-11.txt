TESTIMONIALS. FROM THE PRESIDENT AND MANAGERS OF ANDERSON'S UNIVERSITY. Anderson’s University, 12th February, 184G. The President and Managers of Anderson’s University, have to certify, that Dr. Moses S. Buchanan has been five years Professor of Anatomy in the University. They have to express the very high opinion which they entertain of Dr. Buchanan’s abilities as a Teacher of Anatomy, and of the very successful manner in which he has conducted the classes under his charge. Dr. Buchanan’s success has been publicly attested by the yearly increase in the number of his students; and his eminent talents as a Teacher have contributed very materially to the high position which this University holds as a Medical School. The President and Managers have much pleasure in bearing testimony to Dr. Buchanan’s correct and gentlemanly conduct on all occasions during the period he has been connected with this University. Dr. Buchanan’s removal from his present Chair would be felt as a great loss by this University, but as his attainment of the Chair of Anatomy in Edinburgh would be an advancement in his profession, the President and Managers wish him all manner of success in his present application; and they are satisfied that his appointment would be very beneficial to that or any other University with which he may be con- nected.

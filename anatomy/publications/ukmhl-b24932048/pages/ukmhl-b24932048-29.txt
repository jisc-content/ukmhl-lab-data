25 the Glasgow Royal Infirmary, the testimonials of eminent medical men, and his long experience as a Practitioner, are a sufficient guarantee. As a Teacher of Anatomy, I can confidently testify that Dr. Buchanan has few rivals; an opinion founded on the unprecedented success which has attended his labours in the Andersonian University, and previously in the Portland-Street Medical School. For several years he has, undoubtedly, had the most numerously attended classes for Practical and Descriptive Anatomy in Scotland, and I have reason to know that the Chair of Anatomy, in this Institution, never stood in a higher position than at the present moment; a circumstance entirely owing to the unwearied activity and zeal, and peculiar aptitude for teaching, which distinguish the present Professor. I am fully sensible of the combination of qualities which arc necessary to render any one an efficient Public Instructor, but I can, with all truth, state, that while I am aware that among the Candidates who will offer themselves for the vacant Chair, some will be eminent for their scientific publications, and others for long medical practice, some for enthusiasm and scholarship, and others for skill in particular departments of Medical Science, 1 cannot bring myself to believe that any one will combine the necessary qualifications for securing numerous classes to the extent to which these are possessed by Dr. Buchanan, and I feel assured that no one will be more likely to maintain the reputation and extend the usefulness of the University of Edinburgh. I shall sincerely regret any circumstance that will occasion the removal of a colleague, who has, by his efficiency as a Teacher, and his popularity with the students, contributed so materially to raise the Medical School of Andersonâ€™s University to its present flourishing condition, but still, for the sake of Dr. Buchanan himself, I shall rejoice to find him successful in his present application for the Edinburgh Chair.

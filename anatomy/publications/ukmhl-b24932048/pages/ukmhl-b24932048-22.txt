18 FROM A. DUNLOP ANDERSON, ESQ., M.D. Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, and late Physician to the Glasgow Royal Infirmary, dec. 159 St. Vincent-Street, Glasgow, 9th February, 1840. Dr. M. S. Buchanan lias, for many years, been a most zealous and successful Teacher of Anatomy in Glasgow. With many other qualifications, I consider his entire devotedness to the object of communicating a thorough and complete knowledge of his subject to the students to be his peculiar recommendation; and the very numerous classes he has had as the Professor of Anatomy in Anderson’s University, are the best proofs that his efforts are duly appreciated. It seems scarcely necessary to add, that an acquaintance of above twenty years’ duration with Dr. Buchanan has enabled me to form a very favourable estimate of his character. A. DUNLOP ANDERSON, M.D. FROM J. M. PAGAN, ESQ., M.D. Professor of Midwifery in the University of Glasgoiv, dec. Glasgow, 11th February, 1816. I take great pleasure in bearing testimony to the high reputation Dr. M. S. Buchanan has long enjoyed in this city, as a most enthusiastic and successful Teacher of Anatomy, and can most truly affirm that I have heard but one opinion expressed, by the students who have attended his lectures, that his zeal in superintending their studies is indefatigable and unremitting. In addition to his deservedly high reputation as a Teacher of Anatomy, Dr. Buchanan enjoys that of a Surgeon of sound views and large experience, having been for a number of years one of the Surgeons to the Royal Infirmary of this city, which affords a field for observation, probably unequalled, certainly unsurpassed by any hospital in the kingdom. I regard Dr. Buchanan’s qualifications as a practical Surgeon as one of the highest recommendations for the Chair of Anatomy in the University of Edinburgh, the duties of which I am fully persuaded he would discharge with much credit to himself and benefit to the students.

8 COPY OF LETTER ADDRESSED TO THE TRUSTEES OF ANDERSON'S UNIVERSITY, GLASGOW. Glasgow, August 2, 1841. Sir,—Dr. Hunter, having intimated to us his acceptance of the Chair of Anatomy in the Westminster Medical School, we feel that the filling the vacancy thus caused in the Professorship of Anatomy in the Andersonian University, so long and so ably held by him, is of the greatest importance to the Medical School of that University, and to us as members of that School. We understand that Dr. M. S. Buchanan, Lecturer on Anatomy in the Portland-Street Medical School, is desirous of succeeding Dr. Hunter. After mature deliberation, we are unanimously of opinion, that Dr. M. S. Buchanan, by his great success as a teacher of this important branch of medical education, has proved his peculiar fitness to fill the vacancy, and that his appointment would greatly contribute to the success of the Andersonian Medical School. Without presuming to interfere in your choice, we beg to express to you our desire to have Dr. M. S. Buchanan as our colleague, and most respectfully to recommend his claims to your consideration. Mr. Penny, Professor of Chemistry, is in London; but we have reason to know that he fully concurs in the sentiments expressed in this letter. We are, Sir, Your most obedient Servants, A. J. HANNAY, M.D., Professor of the Practice of Medicine. J. A. LAWRIE, M.D., Professor of Surgery. JAMES BROWN, M.D., Professor1 of Obstetrics. J. A. EASTON, M.D., Professor of Materia Medica. ANDW.

6 My Museum of Anatomy, which contains upwards of two thousand preparations, chiefly for class illustration, has been in whole collected and prepared by myself. I may also state that there is not an Hospital, Medical School, or Museum of celebrity, either at home or on the continent of Europe, which I have not carefully examined. As to my success in teaching, the accompanying Testimonials, I trust, will be satisfactory; but, in corroboration, I think it right to state that, the number of students attending my Lectures and Demonstrations has progressively increased, while the number of medical students throughout the kingdom has considerably diminished.* My first courses in 1836 were attended by forty-four students, in this session there are in both classes two hundred and thirty-four. I have added a list of my publications, some of which I shall present for your perusal, as early as possible. I have the honour to be, My Lord Provost and Gentlemen, Your very obedient Servant, M. S. BUCHANAN. * Subjoined are the numbers that have attended my two classses during the winter sessions, from 1836 to 1846 :— Years.

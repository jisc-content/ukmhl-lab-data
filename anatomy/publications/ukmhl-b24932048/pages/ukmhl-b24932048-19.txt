I must also add, that as a highly honourable gentleman, and a kind private friend, those who have the good fortune to associate with Dr. Buchanan, will find him equalled by few, and surpassed by no one. WILLIAM WEIR, M.D. FROM HARRY RAINY, ESQ., M.D. Professor of Medical Jurisprudence in the University of Glasgow, <Vc. University of Glasgow, 10th February, 104(>. Dr. Moses Buchanan has, for many years, been eminently distinguished as a Teacher of Anatomy in this city. He has devoted himself to this department of medicine with great ardour, and has been most successful in communicating a similar spirit to his pupils. His classes have, from an early period, been well attended, and have increased progressively and steadily, notwithstanding the general falling off in the Medical Schools. On these grounds, I consider Dr. Moses Buchanan as qualified, in noordinary degree, for the important Chair for which he is now a Candidate.

Buchanan, as a Teacher of Anatomy. For several years I had the happiness to be associated with him when he conducted the Anatomical Class in the Portland-Street School of Medicine. The improvements introduced by him, in the management of that Class, met with my warmest approval, and also that of my colleagues. He had the means, and no expense was spared by him, in furnishing every thing necessary for the improvement of those students who attended him; the Class rapidly increased.

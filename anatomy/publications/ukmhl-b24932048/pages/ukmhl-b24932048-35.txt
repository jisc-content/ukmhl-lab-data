31 Anatomy, and the great experience which you acquired in the Surgical Wards of the Infirmary, enabled you to know practically what the student of Anatomy requires to be taught; and I have reason to know that while your expositions of Descriptive Anatomy arc most complete, you never lose an opportunity of showing its connection with Surgery, and its true practical importance as the groundwork of all Medical Science. Having been a Lecturer on Surgery for many years, I may perhaps be excused when I say, that such arc the qualifications which are requisite in the Professor of Anatomy at the head of a great Medical School; and such, I repeat, are exactly the qualifications which you pre-eminently possess. I do not know, therefore, where the Patrons of the Chair of Anatomy in the University of Edinburgh could find a man who knows better what the students ought to be taught, or who, by natural endowments, is better able to communicate that knowledge than you. As a colleague, I entertain for you great personal friendship—we have been associated for years in the wards of the Glasgow' lloyal Infirmary, and as Teachers in Anderson’s University—and I gladly embrace this opportunity of expressing my deep sense of your uniform good humour, kindness, and unceasing desire to oblige—on no single occasion has the slightest approach to unkindly feeling existed between us. Should you succeed in your present laudable object of ambition, the Medical School of Glasgow will sustain a great loss—that of Anderson’s University one which, I fear, will be irreparable; and one to which I can only be reconciled, by feeling assured that the change will not only benefit you, but will advance the interests of practical Anatomy and practical Surgery in Scotland. Sincerely wishing you success, I am, My Dear Sir, Most truly yours, J. A. LAWRIE, M.D. Du. M. S. Buchanan.

94 anterior and middle thirds, i.e.^ behind the coraco- brachialis and short head o£ the biceps, which are easily felt. The neuro-vascular bundle is very super- ficial, and is exposed as soon as the deep fascia is divided. The vein is internal. The artery is more or less concealed between the several nerves of the upper limb, the median nerve being in front and to its outer side, and the ulnar nerve behind and to its inner side. The aneurism needle should be passed from the inner side. Collateral CmcuLATiON.—The intercostal arteries, including the aortic intercostals, the intercostal branches of the internal mammai’y, and the superior intercostal branch of the subclavian—anastomose with the superior thoracic, the long thoracic or external mammary, and the thoracic branches of the acroniio-thoracic and subscapular. The supra- and posterior scapular anastomose with the subscapular. The acromial branches of the acromio-thoracic anastomose with the anterior and posterior circumflex. I Ligature of the Brachial Artery along * the Arm.—incision along a line drawn from junc- tion of anterior and middle thirds of axilla to a point midway between the condyles of the humerus, avoid- ing the basilic vein in the lower part of the arm. Clearly expose the inner border of the biceps. The artery lies beneath it, crossed from without inwards by the median nerve. Pass the aneurism needle from the nerve. Ligature of the Brachial Artery at the Bend of the Elbow.—Curved incision downwards

120 Pieogoff’s Amputation.—To complete as a Piro- goff, cut do\Fnwards and forwards from the points above named on either side of the heel, and join the two oblique incisions by a transverse incision across the sole of the foot. Then saw through the os calcis in the line of the incisions just made, leaving the back part of the bone in the heel flap. Saw off a little more of the tibia and fibula than in the case of the Syme, Oeiginal Wat of doing a Syme.—Mark out the heel flap as above. The foot being supported with the sole towards you, dissect up the heel flap from off the os calcis, pressing the flap down with the left thumb, and keeping the knife close to the bone, especially on the inner side. Divide tendo Achillis, make the dorsal incision, disarticulate, and saw off the lower part of the tibia and fibula. Parts Divided in Dorsal Incision.—Skin; superficial fascia containing the internal or long saphenous vein and nerve, the two branches of the inusculo-cutaneous nerve, small twigs from the internal and external malleolar and anterior peroneal arteries; tendons of the tibialis anticus, extensor longus digitorum, extensor proprius pollicis, and peroneus tertius ; possibly the tendon of the tibialis posticus, which latter tendon, however, may be divided in the heel flap ; the anterior tibial artery, with the anastomosis of its external malleolar branch with the tarsal and anterior peroneal; the anterior tibial nerve. Parts Divided in Making Heel Flap. —Skin ; thick stratum of sub- cutaneous fat containing the short or external saphenous vein and nerve, the plantar cutaneous nerve, the internal calcanean artery; the peronei longus and brevis; the fleshy portion of the extensor brevis digitoram, in the case of the Pirogoff, and also in the case of the Sjune if the heel flap is made unusually large; the flexor brevis digitonim, abductor pollicis, abductor minimi digit!; the flexor longus pollicis; the flexor

117 Divide the plantar ligaments and the tendons of the peronei longus and brevis; pass the knife beneath the metatarsal bones, and complete the plantar flap, keeping the sole of the foot towards you. Parts Divided ix Dorsal Incisiox.—Skin; superficial fascia con- taining venous arch on dorsum of foot, with origins of internal and external saphenous veins; the corresponding nerves, also the Internal & external branches of the niusculo-cutaneous; deep fascia; tendons of extensor longus digitorum, extensorproprius pollicis, peroneus tertius, and part of tendon of tibialis anticus ; fleshy portion of the extensor brevis digitorum; dorealis pedis artery, with its metatarsal branch and one or more of the dorsal interosseous branches given off from the latter; internal branch of anterior tibial nerve. Parts Divided ix Plaxtar Flap. —Skin ; thick stratum of sub- cutaneous fat containing the digital vessels and nerves; slips of the plantar fascia to the toes; flexor brevis digitorum, abductor pollicis, abductor minimi digiti; flexor longus digitorum, with the lumbricales ; flexor longus pollicis. The muscles of the the third layer—that is, the flexor brevis and adductor pollicis, the flexor brevis minimi digiti, and the transversus pedis—will be divided more or less obliquely, the latter perhaps escaping altogether. The plantar vessels and nerves should be divided as far forwards as possible, the surgeon keeping as close as he can to the bones when completing the plantar flap. Key’s Amputation differs from the above in that the metatarsal bones are sawn through near their bases instead of being disarticulated. Chopart’s, or Medio-tarsal Amputation. —Left hand to grasp sole of foot, finger and thumb marking the tubercle of the scaphoid and the line of the calcaneo-cuboid articulation (the former always easily felt—see p. 42). Dorsal incision slightly convex forwards between points named, t.e., across the foot over the tubercle of the scaphoid. Plantar flap, like

112 anterior wall of Hunter’s canal. The position of the artery being recognised by the finger, the anterior wall of Hunter’s canal is to be divided over the artery on a director. The long saphenous nerve is antero-external to the artery and close to it; the vein is postero-external. The aneurism needle is most conveniently passed from the inner side. Collateral Circulation.—The perforating branches of the profunda anastomose with the two superior articular branches of the popliteal; he descending branch of the external circumflex anastomoses with he superior e.xtemal articular. The Common Femoral is not usually tied, on account of the danger of secondary hajmorrhage resulting from the vicinity of the large profunda branch. It would easily he found by an incision along the line indicated, begun just below Poupart’s ligament. Collateral Circulation.—The gluteal and the circumflex iliac anastomose with the ascending branch of the external circumflex, and with the superficial circumflex iliac. The sciatic and obturator arteries anastomose with both circumflex. The co/nes ncrvi ischiadici anastomose with the perforating branches of the profunda. Ligature of the Anterior Tibial Artery. —Incision along a line drawn from a point a little in- ternal to head of the fibula to a point midway between the two malleoli. A more or less distinct white line in the deep fascia (the first one from the inner border of the tibia) marks the interspace between the tibialis anticus and the extensor longus digitorum. Divide the deep fascia over this line. Open up the muscu- lar interspace, and work your way towards the in-

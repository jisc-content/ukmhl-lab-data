projection of the metacarpal bone at the bottom of the “ anatomical snuff-box.” Radial Artery.—Euns along a line drawn from midway between condyles of humertes to a point jtist internal to the styloid process of the radius. In the upper third of its course it is covered by the supinator longns. Lower down it lies in the grove between the tendon of that muscle and that of the flexor carpi radialis. The radial nerve lies close to the outer side of the artery in the middle third of the forearm, but is distant from it both above and below. At the wrist the radial ai’tery gives off the superficialis voice, which crosses the thenar eminence, and some- times pulsates distinctly. Ulnar Artery. —Euns deeply at first from the bend of the elbow to near the middle of the inner border of the forearm. It then descends more super- ficially between the flexor carpi ulnaris and the flexor sublimis digitorum. Here it runs along a line drawn from the inner condyle, or a point a little external to it. to a point a little external to the pisiform bone. The ulnar nerve lies close to the inner side of the artery in the lower two-thirds of its course. Superficial Palmar Arch.—Crosses palm of hand about junction of middle and upper thirds, opposite lower border of abducted thumb. Deep

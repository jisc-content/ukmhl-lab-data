61 THORAX AND BACK. Sternillll.—Behind the first piece of the bone we find the left innominate vein, behind which are the innominate, left common carotid, and left subclavian arteries, the trachea, and the oesophagus. Below the left innominate vein comes the arch of the aorta, the highest part of which lies an inch below the upper border of the sternum. The trachea divides into the t\\ o bronchi opposite the articulation between the two first pieces of the sternum, below and behind the arch of the aorta. The innominate artery runs along a line drawn from the middle of the above articulation to behind the right sterno-clavicular joint. The internal mammary arteries run behind the costal cartilages half an inch from either side of tlie sternum. The top of the sternum corresponds to the second dorsal vertebra; its lower extremity corresponds to the tenth. Ribs .—The second ?-ib corresponds to the articula- tion between the first and second pieces of the sternum; the fifth, to the lower border of the pectoralis major; the sixth, to the highest digitation 5

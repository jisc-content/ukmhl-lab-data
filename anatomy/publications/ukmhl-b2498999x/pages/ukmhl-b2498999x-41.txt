from the origin of the latter from the external iliac. In this case the trunk common to the two arteries passes inwards above the femoral ring, and then the obturator artery descends into the pelvis on the inner side of the ring, behind Gimbernat’s ligament. Anterior Superior Spine of Ilium.—The most convenient point from which to measure the relative length of the two lower limbs in suspected fracture, dislocation, or hip-joint disease. Great Troclianter.—Lies in a line drawn from anterior superior spine of ilium to most prominent part of tuberosity of ischium {]Velato7i’s line). It is more convenient, however, as a test of dislocation or fracture, to compare on the two sides the vertical distance between the great trochanter and the anterior superior spine of the ilium {Brya/ifs test). The upper part of the great trochanter is nearly on a level with the spine of the pubes. Sartorius Muscle.—Easily defined on the living by instructing patient to raise his leg over thigh of opposite side. Forms outer border of Scarpa’s triangle, at apex of which it erosses femoral artety three or four inches below Poupart's Uga7nent. Further down, over Hunter’s canal, the muscle becomes somewhat internal to the artery.

39 ment of knee-joint); also one beneath tendon of semi- membranosus. From Holden's dissections, it seems to be the former, and not the latter, which is frequently enlarged, and sometimes communicates with the knee- joint. Popliteal Artery.—First obliquely dow nwards and outwards from opening in lower part of adductor magnus, then vertically downwards to lower border of popliteus, where it divides, an inch below the tubercle of the tibia, into antei-ior and posterior tibial. In the greater part of its course it has the vein posterior and external and close to it, and the internal popliteal nerve posterior and external to, and at a distance from, both vessels. Quite at the lower pai-t of the popliteal space, both the vein and the nerve become internal to the artery. The ex- ternal popliteal nerve lies in the outer part of popliteal space, close to the tendon of the biceps. Fibula,—Head, prominent at lower, outer, and back part of knee-joint, about an inch below the line of articulation. Its upper extremity marks the lower boundary of the synovial membrane of the knee-joint. Shaft, oblique downwards and backwards: sub- cutaneous in lower third. External malleolus, pointed; situated lower down and further back tlian the internal; marks outer extremity of incisions for

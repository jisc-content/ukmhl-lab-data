96 eating branch of the ulnar. On the back of the wrist, there is the com- munication between tbe posterior carpal branches of the radial and ulnar to fonn the posterior carpal arch, into which opens also the posterior interosseous. Ligature of the Radial Artery.—incision along a line drawn from a point midway between tbe condyles of tbe bumerus to a point a little internal to tbe styloid process of tbe radius. In its LOWER THiRn, tbe artery is situated between tbe tendons of tbe supinator longus and flexor carpi radialis, immediately beneath tbe deep fascia, and has no nerve accompanying it. Tbe aneurism needle may be pas.sed from either side. Collateral Circi'LATion. — On the back of the wrist, the posterior carpal branch of the ulnar and the posterior interosseous anastomose with the posterior caipal branch of the radial. In the palm of the hand, we have the anastomosis between the deep or communicating branch of the ulnar and the termination of the radial, forming the deep palmar arch, which latter is also joined by twigs from the anterior inter- osseous. The superficial palmar arch of the ulnar also joins either with the superficialis voko, or with the radialis indicis, or princeps pollicis. In its xiiDDLE THIRD, the artery lies between the muscles above named, which are here becoming fleshy, and it has tbe radial nerve to its outer side. The anenrism needle should here be passed from tbe outer side. Collateral circulation as above, also throunb numerous muscular branches. In its UPPER THIRD, the artery lies just beneath tbe thin inner edge of the fleshy portion of the supinator longus. To tie it here, after making the incision

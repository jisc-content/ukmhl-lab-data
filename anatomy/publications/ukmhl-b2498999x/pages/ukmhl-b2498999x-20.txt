14 the intermuscular space between the deltoid and the pectoralis major. Its apex lies somewhat beneath the deltoid. Both can he distinctly ■ felt when the arm is abducted. Axillary Artery.—Lies first just to the inner side of the coracoid process, and can here be com- pressed against the second rib, though with difficulty, and not for long. The position of the artery is here indicated by a line drawn from junction of outer and middle thirds of clavicle to outer part of axilla. Lower down the artery lies behind the coraco- brachialis and short head of the biceps, on the inner side of the head of the humerus. This being de- pressed by the raising of the arm, the artery can be compressed against it in the outward direction. The position of the artery is here indicated by a line drawn from junction of the anterior and middle thirds of axilla to a point midway between the condyles of the humerus; which line also indicates, lower down, the position of the brachial artery. Folds of Axilla. — Anterior fold corresponds to fifth rib; posterior fold descends a little lower. Highest digitation of serratus magnus usually visible in axilla corresponds to sixth rib.

123 Amputation of Lower Part of Thigh. —Circular; modified circular; lateral flaps by transfixion; or long anterior and short posterior flaps, as follows :— Make a long anterior flap from without inwards, taking skin only below, skin and muscles above; make a short posterior flap by transfixion. Amputation through Middle or Upper Part of Thigh .—Same methods as above, but here the anterior and posterior flaps may be of equal length, or nearly so. The modified circular—short anterior & posterior skin flaps and circular division of the muscles—is the method generally adopted. Excision of Hip-Joint.—Thigh flexed and adducted. Joint to be entered by an incision behind great trochanter, and curving slightly forwards above it. Head of femur to be levered out by forcibly rotating limb inwards, and sawn off. Cotyloid cavity may require scraping. With a good assistant to manage lower limb, this is a relatively easy operation when the joint is diseased. In the healthy subject, the operation is somewhat difficult. (See note, page 103.) Parts Divided.—Greater part of insertion of the gluteus ma.\imus, gluteus medius, inferior branch of superior gluteal nerve, and inferior branch of deep division of gluteal artery; then, from above downwards, gluteus minimus, pyriformis, obturator internus and gemelli, obturator

89 * Condensed from Erichsen’s “Science and Art of Surgery.” tlie (lead body it is evident that if two equal flaps, each half the diameter of the limb at tlie point at which the bone is divided, were cut, they would accurately meet and cover the bone ; but such flaps in the living body would be totally inadequate, on account of the shrinking from the elasticity of the skin and the displacement from the contraction of the muscles. It is necessary to provide another half diameter of covering at least, and in some situations even this amount is barely sufficient. Let us suppose a limb is to be amputated, the antero-posterior diameter of which, at the point where the bone is to be sawn, is six inches, the necessary diameter and a half of covering could be obtained in the following ways amongst others:—(1) one long flap nine inches long; (2) two flaps, one six inches long and the other three; (3) two equal flaps four and a half inches long ; (4) two equal flaps three inches long, and retraction of the muscles from the hone to such an extent as to provide an inch and a half of covering on each side ; (5) a circular incision raising the skin and fat for three inches, and another circular cut through the muscles with retraction of the soft parts from the bone for one inch and a half In the lower third of the thigh the covering should be increased to two diameters to allow for the very excessive retraction of the long flexor muscles. In the amputation of the leg by the long calf flap, it is also necessary to provide very abundant covering to allow for the subsequent shrinking of the muscular tissue which fonns the posterior flap.” Instead of attaching quite so much importance as above to the precise preliminary measurement of flaps, the author would suggest that it is enough, at least in operations on the dead body, that the operator, having determined approximately the point of intended division of the bone, should out the flaps approxunately to suit, and having cut them, verify by examination a vue ilosil before sawixo the boxb, whether or not they are sufficient, and it they are not, clear and saw the bone a little higher up. The writer would strongly press the inexperienced operator to make it a point never to saw the bone before pausing to verify that the covering he has provided is sufficient. Composition of Flaps or other Covering.* —“All surgeons are now agreed that too much muscle in a flap is an un- mitigated evil. The objections to muscular flaps are that they are heavy, and consequently liable to be displaced; that, supposing any voluntary movement or involuntary jerking or twitching of the limb to occur, the surfaces of the flaps are moved upon each other, and primary union is thus prevented; that muscular flaps retract to a considerable extent after the operation, and continue to shrink for some time, thus causing a tendency to protrusion of the bone ; and lastly that, as in the end the muscle completely wastes away, the idea that a muscular

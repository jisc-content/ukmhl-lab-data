122 Amputation through Knee - Joint; Carden’s Amputation through Femoral Condyles.—in either case make an anterior flap of skin and fascia about five or six inches long. In former operation, disarticulate, and make a short pos- terior flap from within outwards, by cutting from the deeper parts to the skin. In latter operation, make a short posterior flap by transfixion, and saw through condyles. In either operation, the patella, if healthy, may be left; in amputation through the condyles, its articular surface may be removed (Gritti’s operation). Excision of Knee-Joint.—Stand opposite knee, which shpuld be flexed. Transverse incision between patella and tubercle of tibia slightly curved up on either side on the femoral condyles. Enter joint, thoroughly dividing lateral ligaments. Divide crucial ligaments downwards on head of tibia. Saw off upper part of tibia and lower part of con- dyles, the tibia being drawn forw'ards from the popliteal artery (this is easy when the lateral liga- ments are well divided). The saw-cuts through "the bones must be at right angles to the respective shafts.* * In the case of the femur, the saw-cut, though made at right angles to the shaft from before backwards, may advantageous!}', in the trans- verse direction, he made to incline slightly dowTiwards and inwards, in a direction parallel to the under surface of the condyles, of which the inner one descends somewhat lower than the outer one.

124 externus, quadratus femoris, and part of adductor magnus, with branches from the sciatic, obturator and external circumflex arteries, and the terminal branch of the internal circimiflex ; capsule of the joint, with the round ligament or ligamentum teres. Amputation at Hip-Joint.—Flap Method. —Thigh flexed, and, at first, rotated slightly out- wards, so as to get the great trochanter well back. Long knife entered midway between antei'ior superior spine of ilium and great trochanter, passed down- Avards and in\A'ards below and parallel to Poupart’s ligament, and brought out opposite tuberosity of ischium. The point will impinge at first upon the femur, when it must be raised, in doing which the capsule of the joint will probably be opened. Cut an anterior flap some six or eight inches long. Dis- articulate, the limb being forcibly abducted and rotated outwards. The limb being noAv rotated in- Avards, so as again to get the great trochanter out of the way, cut a posterior flap about four inches long. The flap amputation at the hip probably leaves nothing to be desired as regards the flaps themselves, or the ease and rapidity with which they can be cut. But the gre*at drawback of the operation is the haemorrhage which accompanies it, especially from the arteries of the buttock—the gluteal and the sciatic— unless special means be adopted. The elastic tourni- quet can scarcely be applied high enough to be thoroughly efficient, and it would be most unsafe

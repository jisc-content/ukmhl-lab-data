129 the incision should correspond to the hyoid bone; posteriorly it should he prolonged towards (not to) the angle of the jaw; anteriorly it should be pro- longed towards (not to) a point half an inch external to the symphysis menti. The skin, superficial fascia, platysma, and deep fascia being divided, the sub- maxillary gland will be exposed. This being freed and drawn up, the operator will look for the hypo- glossal nerve as it runs on the surface of the hyo- glossus muscle, and will define the small triangle which the nerve forms with the two bellies of the digastric and the stylo-hyoid, before it disappears beneath the mylo-hyoid. The lingual vein being drawn aside, the hyo-glossus is to he divided in this small triangular space, when the artery will he fomad beneath it. The lingual artery may also be secured behind the posterior belly of the digastric and stylo-hyoid.. It runs here between and parallel to both the hypo-glossal nerve, above, and the great cornu of the hyoid bone, below. A transverse incision a little above the great cornu of the h}'oid bone having exposed the hyo - glossus muscle in the situation named, the division of the muscle between the hypo-glossal nerve and the great cornu of the hyoid bone will bring the artery into view. In the operation on the living body the hyoid bone must be forcibly drawn down by hooks so as to save the soft parts from constant displacement through movements of deglutition.

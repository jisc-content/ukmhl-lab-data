21 Carpus.â€”The tubercle of the scaphoid can be felt below and in front of tlie styloid process of the radius. Below it can be felt the trapezium, though less distinctly, as it is covered by the muscles of the thenar eminence. Below, and a good way in front of the styloid process of the ulna, is the rounded prominence of the pisifor?n bone. Below this is the indistinctly felt prominence of the unciform process of the unciform bone. The cu7iei- form bone can be distinctly felt at the back of the carpus, a little below the head of the; ulna. Joints of the Fingers.- IN^otice on the skele- ton that, in the extended position, the metacarpal bones and phalanges are placed end to end, and that, in the flexed position, the distal bone is found in front of the proximal one. The line of articulation lies, therefore, in the flexed position of a joint, at a distance from the coiTesponding knuckle (or projection of the proximal bone behind) equal to thickness from before backwards of the distal extremity of the proximal bone.* The position of the joint of the metacatpal bone of the thumb is indicated by the above-mentioned * This fact will prove, it is believed, the surest guide to the situation of the joints of the fingers. The flexion lines on the palmar aspect of the fingers are all wrong as guides to the joints, excejit the second one from the tip of the finger. The first one from the tip is much above, and the third one much below, the corresponding joint.

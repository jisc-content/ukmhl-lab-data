155 OPERATIONS ON THE FEMALE ORGANS. The connections of the uterus to the vaginal wall and the peritoneum of the recto-vaginal and utero- vesical pouches may warrant the following brief out- line of certain operations on the female genital organs. Vaginal Amputation of tlie Cervix.— Applicable only when the disease is very limited. The cervix is seized with a vulsellum, and drawn down, when the diseased portion may be removed with either knife, scissors, or galvano-cautery, the latter means being the most satisfactory. Supra - Vaginal Amputation of the Cervix. — Here the vaginal mucous membrane is divided, and the cervix is separated from its connec- tions to the bladder ; but the peritoneum is not opened. The cervix, and a wedge-shaped portion of the body of the uterus, can now be removed. The cut surfaces of the stump are united to the anterior and posterior walls of the vagina. Hysterectomy, or Total Extirpation of the Uterus,—Here the cervix is cleared all round.

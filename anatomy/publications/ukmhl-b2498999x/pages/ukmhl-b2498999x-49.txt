43 Dorsalis Pedis Artery.—Extends from mid- way between tlie malleoli to back part of first inter- osseous space, lying on bones of tarsus between tendon of extensor proprius pollicis and innermost tendon of extensor brevis digitorum, which latter crosses it near its termination. It has the anterior tibial nerve on its outer side. Internal Plantar Artery. —Euns between flexor brevis digitorum and abductor and flexor brevis pollicis, from inner side of os calcis towards middle of big toe. External Plantar Artery. -Euns beneath flexor brevis digitorum from same point to base of fifth metatarsal bone, and then deeply across sole of foot to back of first interosseous space, where it joins with communicating branch of dorsalis pedis. up in front of the cuboid in such a way that the knife placed against it is bound to enter the joint at once, and thus the tuljerole is the best possible guide for opening the joint, it is, on the other liand, not nearly so pro- minent, before the skin is divided, as is the tubercle of the scaplioid, and is therefore not so good a guide for the skin incisions. The tubercle of the scaphoid, on the other hand, though a better guide tor the skin incisions, is not so good a guide to the articulation, which is here a curved line more difficult to find than the straight line of the calcaneo-cuboid joint.

118 that in Key’s or Lisfranc’s, only a little shorter— extending to base of ball of big toe—to be marked out by a deep cut running parallel to line of attach- ment of toes, but not completed in the first instance. Feel for the tubercle of Chopart (the anterior pro- jecting part of the os calcis, which rises above the level of the cuboid), and open the calcaneo-cuboid joint, which lies immediately in front of this tubercle. The joint between the astragalus and the scaphoid lies internal and just a little further back. (Beware of getting between the scaphoid and the three cunei- forms instead of opening the astragalo - scajDhoid joint.) Complete the plantar flap as in Key’s or Lisfranc’s amputation, dividing the tibialis posticus and peroneus longus (and the peroneus brevis, if it has not already been divided), and the plantar ligaments. Parts Divided in Dorsal Incision. — Skin ; superficial fascia con- taining the internal and external saphenous veins and nerves, and the internal and external branches of the musculo-cutaneous nerve; deep fascia ; tendons of the tibialis anticus, extensor longus digitorum, exten- sor proprius pollicis, and peroneus tertius,—perhaps also the peroneus brevis; fleshj' portion of the extensor brevis digitorum; dorsalis pedis arterj', with its tarsal branch, and probably the anastomosis of the latter vdth the anterior peroneal and the external malleolar, also small anastomosing branches between the internal malleolar and the internal calcanean ; internal and external branches of the anterior tibial nerve. Parts Divided in Plantar Flap.—Skin; thick stratum of subcutaneous fat containing small branches of the plantar vessels and nerves, and twigs from the plantar cutaneous ner\’e ; plantar fascia, with its slips to the toes ; flexor brevis digitorum, abductor pollicis, abductor minimi digiti; flexor longus digitorum, with the origins of the lumbricales; flexor longus pollicis. Three of the muscles of the third layer—the flexor

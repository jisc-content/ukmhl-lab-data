Middle Meningeal Artery. — Crosses the anterior inferior angle of the parietal about a7i inch and a half behind, and half an inch above, the external angular process of the frontal bone (or an inch and a quarter above the zygoma—Treves). Rules for Exposing the Motor Centres of the Cerebral Cortex.—l^irst find the bregma, or point of junction of the coronal and saggital sutures, by drawing a line over the vertex from one external auditory meatus to the other, the head being in the usual erect position. Then define the fissure of Rolando. This runs downwards and forwards from a point 5| centimetres behind the bregma to a point 3 centimetres above and 7 centimetres behind the external angular process of the frontal. The motor centres are grouped round the fissure of Rolando, and lie, roughly speaking, as follows:— Those corresponding to the lower limb, behind the upper part of the fissure ; those corresponding to the tipper limb, around tlie middle of the fissure ; and those corresponding to the muscles of the face, below and in front of the fissure. External Auditory Canal.—Runs forwards and inwards, with a slight concavity downwards, and

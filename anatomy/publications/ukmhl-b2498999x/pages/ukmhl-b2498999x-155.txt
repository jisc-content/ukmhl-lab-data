Here the instrument exercises continuous pressure on the stricture, and causes relatively rapid absorption of the inflammatory pro- ducts which have been poured out. II.

There are three modes of treatment of this class of stricture: — Symds perinczal section, internal urethrotomy, and fo7-cible dilatation or “ splitting:’ III. —Cases of imbassabbe stricture with reten- tion are generally chronic cases suddenly become acute through some irritation or other, and in w'hich, if relief is not obtained by the simple means of a hot hath with full dose of laudanum, tapping must imme- diately be performed, either through the rectum or above the pubes. Tapping through the 7-ectian (some- what the less severe operation) is indicated when there is reason to believe that, on subsidence of the acute condition, the case will come under either I. or II. as above described. Tapping above the pubes is indicated w'hen there is reason to fear that, after temporary

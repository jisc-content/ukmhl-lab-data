16 the axillary artery and vein, and the cords of the brachial plexus. Apex.—Corresponds to the interval between the clavicle, the first rib, and the upper border of the scapula. Base.—Formed by the strong deep fascia extend- ing from the pectoralis major to the teres major and latissimus dorsi. It is tensed in the abducted position of the arm, and re- laxed in the adducted position, in which latter position the arm should always be placed for tlie exploration of the axilla. Deltoid.—Can be raised from the shoulder when the arm is abducted, so as to allow, to some extent, of the formation of a deltoid flap by transfixion. Over its insertion is a slight depression, which was formerly selected as a convenient seat for setons and issues. Brachial Artery.—huns along a line drawn from junction of anterior and middle thirds of axilla to midway between condyles of hume7“us. It lies just beneath the inner border of the biceps, and is crossed from without inwards by the median nerve. It may be compressed backwards and out- wards on the shaft of the humerus along the whole of its course.

23 palmar arch lies half an inch higher up. The siiper- ficial palmar interosseous (or digital) artei'ies run taivards the clefts between the fingers, and lie, therefore, between the shafts of the metacarpal bones. Incisions in the palm below the line of the thumb should be made towards the fingers—that is to say, over the metacarpal hones. Upon the fingers, the dmital arteries run along the sides of the sheaths behind the corresponding nerves. Incisions to open thecal abscesses should be made over the middle line of the finger. Front of the Wrist .—Shows, in forcible flexion, the tendons of the flexor carpi radialis and palmaris lo7igus. The median nerve lies close to the inner border of the former. (The palmaris longus is some- times absent.) The lower of the t/'ansvase furrows here visible corresponds to the upper edge of the anterior annular ligament, and to the medio-carpal joint. The synovial sheath common to the flexorcs sublimis and profundus, and that of the flexor longus pollicis, extend an inch and a half above the upper edge of the anterior annular ligament. Interiorly these sheaths communicate with the special sheaths of the thumb and little finger, but not with those of the index, middle, and ring fingers, ending, as regards tliese fingers, about the middle of the palm.

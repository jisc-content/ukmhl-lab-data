130 down upon the middle third of the clavicle, divide it, with the superficial fascia and platysma, from the sterno-mastoid to the trapezius. Allowing the soft parts to retract, divide the deep fascia, being mindful of the external jugular vein at the inner extremity of the wound. The vein being retracted, and the outer part of the sterno-mastoid, if its clavicidar origin is extensive, being divided, look for the posterior belly of the omo-hyoid, but without using the knife, as the situation of the transversalis humeri and transversalis colli arteries is very variable. Now feel downwards and inwards for the outer border of the scalenus anticus; this will lead down to the first rib and the scalene tubercle. The artery will be found resting on the rib behind the muscle and the tubercle. The cords of the bi’achial plexus lie above the artery. The vein lies below and in front of the artery, separated from it by the scalenus anticus. The aneurism needle should be passed from the outer side. Collateral Circulation. — The sn/>ra- and posterior scapular arteries anastomose with the subscapular and with its dorsalis scapul® branch. The hitercostal arteries, including the aortic intercostals, the superior intercostal from the first part of the subclavian, and the inter- costal branches of the internal mammary, anastomose with the superior thoracic, with the long thoracic or external mammary, and with the thoracic branches of the acromio-thoracic and subscapular. Ligature of the Innominate Artery, of the 1st Part of the Right Subclavian, and of the Lower Part of the Right Common

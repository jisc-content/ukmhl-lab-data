131 Carotid.—Two incisions are requisite to render these operations at all easy, one running for about two inches along the lower part of the anterior border of the sterno-mastoid, and another running for about the same distance along the upper border of the clavicle and the sternal fourchette. The sternal origin and part of the clavicular origin of the sterno-mastoid, and also the sterno-hyoid and -thyroid muscles being divided, the lower part of the right common carotid will be found in loose cellular tissue behind the inner extremity of the clavicle. This artery will lead down both to the innominate artery and to the first part of the right subclavian. Before, however, these vessels are reached there will have to be avoided and drawn aside—(1) internally,' some of the inferior thyroid veins and the left innominate; (2) externally, the internal jugular vein and the right innominate; and (3) anteriorly, the pneumo-gastric nerve giving off the recurrent laryn- geal. The aneurism needle should be passed from the outer side in the case of the innominate and the lower part of the carotid, from below in the case of the first portion of the subclavian, in which latter case injury to the pleura must be carefully avoided by keeping the aneurism needle close to the artery. In the case of the first portion of the subclavian, the ligature must be applied internally to the origin of the vertebral.

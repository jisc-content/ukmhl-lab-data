98 Amputation of a Finger, with Part of the Metacarpal Bone.—Same incision as above, only beginning highei' up. The finger is not to be disarticulated, but the metacarpal bone is to be separated from the soft parts, and divided with cutting pliers. Its lower part is then to be re- moved along with the finger. Amputation of the Thumb.—An operation very rarely required. Make a palmar flap by trans- fixion from the thenar eminence, entering the knife, on the left side, opposite the carpo-metacarpal joint, and on the right side, in the web. Make a small dorsal flap by carrying the knife across the back of the metacarpal bone from one extremity of the palmar incision to the other. The position of the articulation is indicated by the tubercle on the base of the first metacarpal bone, easily felt in the “ anatomical snufE-box ” (see pp. 20 and 21). Parts Divided in Palmar Flap.—In the palmar flap there will be divided the abductor and the opponens pollicis, the two heads of the flexor brevis with the flexor longus between them, and the adductor; the princeps pollicis artery, and probably also the superficialis volse; digital branches of the median nerve, and filaments of the musculo-cutaneous. Parts Dtpided in Dorsal Flap.—In the dorsal flap there will be divided the extensores ossis metacarpi, primi and secundi internodii pollicis, and the outer head of the first dorsal interosseous muscle or abductor indieis ; the dorsales poUicis arteries; digital branches of the radial nen'e, and filaments of the musculo-cutaneous. The trunk of the radial arterj' must be carefully avoided in disarticulating, as it lies just on the inner side of the base of the metacarpal bone. For the sub-cutaneous structures divided, see structures divided in the amputation at the wrist.

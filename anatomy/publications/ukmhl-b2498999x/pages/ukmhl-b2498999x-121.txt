115 binds down the posterior tibial vessels and nerve upon the deep muscles of the back of the leg. This layer of fascia should be torn through. The nerve is external to the artery. The aneurism needle should be passed from the outer side. The artery may be got at by separating the soleus from the inner herder of the tibia, instead of cutting through the muscle. Ligature of the Posterior Tibial Artery, Lower Third. — The gastrocnemius and soleus having here contracted into the tendo Achillis, an incision midway between this latter tendon and the inner border of the tibia will expose the deep muscles, on the surface of which the posterior tibial vessels and nerve will easily be found. The nerve is external to the artery. The aneurism needle should be passed from the outer side. Collateral Circulation.—The dorsalis pedis—the continuation of the anterior tibial—inosculates with the e.Kternal plantar, one of the branches of bifurcation of the posterior tibial. The peroneal artery anastomoses with the posterior tibial by means of the communicating. The internal malleolar communicates with the internal plantar and the internal cal- canean. The anterior peroneal, the external malleolar, and the tarsal and metatarsal communicate with the external plantar. AMPUTATIONS, &c. Amputation of a Toe. — Oval method, as in case of a finger (see p. 97). The flap method (two lateral flaps) is sometimes adopted, but it has the

128 incision should be made a little lower down than above indicated.* Ligature of the External Carotid. — Incision along the anterior border of the sterno- mastoid extending from the hyoid bone to near the angle of the jaw. The sterno-mastoid being retracted as above, the lower part of the parotid gland must be pulled up and the lingual and facial veins held aside. The artery will then be seen below the pos- terior belly of the digastric and stylo-hyoid, crossed by the hypo-glossal nerve. It lies in front of the internal carotid and somewhat internal to it, and is distinguished from it by the branches it gives off; the internal jugular vein lies on its outer side; the superior laryngeal nerve lies behind it and to its inner side. The aneurism needle should be passed from the outer side. Collateral Circulation. — There are such numerous and free anastomoses, in the face and neck, between the branches of the two external carotids, and at the base of the skull (circle of Willis), between the two internal carotids and the two subclavians (through the vertebrals), that it seems unnecessary to enumerate in detail the channels of collateral circulation in the case of the foregoing ligatures. Ligature of the Lingual Artery.—Curved incision along the concavity of the two bellies of the digastric and the stylo-hyoid. Towards its middle * In the ligature of the several arteries of the head and neck the neck should he extended and the face turned towards the opposite side.

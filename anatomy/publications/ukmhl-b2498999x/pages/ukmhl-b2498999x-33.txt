above and internal, and the femoral ring and hernia below and external to it. External Abdominal Ring.—Triangular, and oblique downwards and inwards ; about an inch long and half an inch wide in the male, but rather smaller in the female. Can easily be felt by invaginating the skin as above. In the normal condition it will admit the tip of the little finger. The s])ermatic cord can be felt emerging from it in the male. The external abdominal ring is bounded externally by its outer or inferior pillar, which is attached to the spine of the pubes; internally by its inner or superior pillar, which decussates with its fellow in front of the symphysis pubis; below by the crest of the pubes: above by the iutercolumuar fibres. From these latter there is continued downwards the intefxohimnar or external spermatic fascia, which is closely adherent to the margins of the ring, and,is prolonged inferiorly into a tubular process round the cord and testis. Internal Abdominal Ring.—Lies about halj an inch above Poupart’s ligament, midway between the anterior superior spine of the ilium and the spine of the pubes. The deep epigastric artery runs upwards and inwards along its lower and inner boundaries. The internal abdominal ring is a tubular opening in the fascia transversalis formed by the prolongation

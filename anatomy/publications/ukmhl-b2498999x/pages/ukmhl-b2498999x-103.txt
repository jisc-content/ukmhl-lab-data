97 along the line above indicated, look for the edge of the supinator longiis, and raise it carefully. The artery will be found immediately beneath it, covered by a thin layer of fascia, which will require to be torn through. It has no nerve accompanying it. The aneurism needle may be passed from either side. Collateral circulation as above. AMPUTATIONS, &c. Amputation of a Terminal Phalanx.— Flex the phalanx. Enter the joint from behind (see page 21), and divide the lateral ligaments. Make an anterior flap extending to near the tip of the finger. Amputation of a Finger.—Oval Method. —Begin dorsal incision three-quarters of an inch above the knuckle ; a little higher if the head of the metacarpal bone is to be removed. Cut downwards as far as the knuckle; then cut obliquely into the web on either side, keeping the knife well upon the finger; cut transversely in the Ime of junction of the finger ivith the pabn. Divide tendons and ligaments, and disarticulate. The removal of the head of the metacarpal bone with cutting pliers diminishes the subsequent de- formity, but weakens the hand. %

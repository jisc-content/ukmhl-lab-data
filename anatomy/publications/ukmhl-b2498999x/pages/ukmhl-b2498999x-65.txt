59 The vein, at this level, is clearly external to the artery on the right side of the neck, Avhile, on the left side, it approaches and sometimes crosses it. Between and behind the two vessels is the pneumo- gastric nerve. The phrenic nerve lies external to the vein, in front of the scalenus anticus. Between the two sterno-mastoids, at the lower part of the neck, is the fonticulus gutturis,‚Äù which rises and sinks in distressed breathing. The sterno-clavicular articulation marks the com- mencement of the innominate vein, and, on the right side, the division of the innominate artery. The Supra-Clavicular Fossa.- is crossed at its lower and inner part by the posterior belly of the omo-hyoid. Below, and then externally to this, it is crossed more or less horizontally, and at a somewhat variable level, by the suprascapular and iransversalis colli vessels ; so that, in the ligature of the sub- clavian artery, the knife should be used with much care after the platysma and deep fascia have been divided. The Triangle formed by the Scaleni Muscles corresponds pretty nearly to the outer border of the sterno-mastoid. Its base is formed by the first rib. Upon this rests the subclavian artery.

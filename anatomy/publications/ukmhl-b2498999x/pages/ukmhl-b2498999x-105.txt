99 Amputation at the Wrist.— Mark out a semicircular flap iu the palm o£ the hand from one styloid process to the other, cutting deeply into the tissues of the palm. Make a dorsal incision between the same points, and enter the joint from behind. Divide the lateral ligaments, and complete the palmar flap by cutting from the deeper parts to the surface, seeing that the knife does not hitch either against the pisiform bone or against the unciform process of the unciform. Parts Divided in Paliiar Flap.—In the palmar flap there will be divided the supei-flcial palmar interosseous or digital branches of the superflcial palmar arch, and the superfloialis voIeb and princeps pollicis branches of the radial, the origins of the median and anterior ulnar veins, the pahnar cutaneous branches of the median and ulnar nerves, and terminal filaments of the internal and external cutaneous nerves ; the palmar fascia; the abductor, opponens, flexores longus and brevis, and adductor pollicis; the abductor, flexor brevis, and adductor or opponens minimi digiti ; the digital branches of the median and ulnar nerves; the tendons of the flexores sublimis and profundus, and, with the latter, the four lumbricales. Parts DmDED in Dorsal Incision.—In the dorsal incision there will be divided the origins of the radial and posterior ulnar veins, the radial nerve and the dorsal cutaneous branch of the ulnar ; and beneath the posterior annular ligament and deep fascia, the following tendons passing through six grooves and six synovial sheaths, namely ; (1) extensor ossis metacarpi and primi internodii pollicis; (2) extensores carpi radiales longior and brevior; (3) extensor secundi internodii pollicis; (4) extensores indicis and communis digitorum ; (5) extensor minimi digiti; (6) extensor carpi ulnaris. The radial artery will be divided between the extensores ossis metacarpi and primi internodii pollicis, on the one hand, and the extensor secundi internodii pollicis, on the other. The dorsal incision may lie either a little above or a little below the level of the posterior carpal arch ; in the former case there would be divided the origins of the arch with the termination of the posterior and anterior interosseous arteries, in the latter case the dorsal interosseous.

92 OF THE SKELETON. Sutures. The sutures are generally distinguished by mrni-.U bers, which have been differently applied ; and there-.I fore I join those («) who prefer the giving names tool each, which may be easily contrived from their si«.| tuation, or from the bones which they connect. The first is the anterior nasal*, which is straight,,! and placed longitudinally in the middle fore-part of.f ' the nose. The second and third are the lateral nasal\, which iB are at each side of the nose, and almost parallel to thee first suture. Each of the two lacrymal is almost semicircular,, and is placed round the lacrymal groove. The sixth and seventh are the internal orbitar;; each of which is extended obliquely from the middle, of the lower side of an orbit to the edge of its base. The two external orbitars are contained, each fromu the end of the internal orbitar, to the under and fore- part of the cheek. The tenth is the mystachial, which reaches onlyy from the lower part of the septum narium to betwejn the two middle denies incisores. The longitudinal palatc% suture stretches from the.] ! middie of the foremost teeth through the middle oiti( all the palate. The transverse palate one || runs across the palate; J nearer the back than the fore-part of it. Each of the two palato-maxillary is at the back-.- part of the side of each nostril. The fifteenth is the spinous, which is in the middlee of the lower part of the nostrils. This may perhaps* u be rather thought a double schindylesis. The connection of the ossa spongiosa to the sideoM \ each nostril, is so much by a membrane in young sub— s, * • I U (a) Vancler Liruleri. Medicin. physiolosr. cnp. 13. art. 2. § 10. —Rolfinc.

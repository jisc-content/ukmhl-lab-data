295 OF THE PARTICULAR NERVES. Thouoh the radial nerve passes through the pronator tauscle, Â°and the muscular nerve seems to be still more unfavourably placed within the supinator brevis ; ye the action 0ftbese,muscles does not seem to have any effect in hindering the influence of these nerves, tor the - finders or hand can be bended while pronation is per, forming vigorously, and they can be extended while supination is exercised. The manner of the going off of these nerves ot the finders, both'from the ulnar and radial, is that a single -branch is sent from the trunk to the side ot the thumb and little-linger farthest from the other 'fingers J and all the rest are supplied by a trunk of a nerve which splits into two some.Way before it comes as far as-the end of the metacarpus, to run along the sides ot riitie- rent fingers that are nearest to each other. It might have been observed, that, in describing the posterior branches of the ulnar and muscular nerve, 1 did not mention the particular lingers, to the convex part of which they are distributed. My reason for this omission is, the uncertainty of their distribution ; for though sometimes these posterior branches go to the same fingers, to the concave part of which the anterior branches of the ulnar and radial are sent, yet frequent- ly they are distributed otherwise. The situation of these brachial nerves in the axilla, may let us see, how a weakness and afthphv may be brought on the arms by long continued pressure or crutches, or such other hard substances on tbifjm't ; and the course of them from the neck to the arm may teach us, bow much better effects ' vesicatories, or sti- mulating nervous nu:dicines would have, when applied to the sk;n, covering the transverse processes of the vertebrae of the neck, or at the axilla, than when they are put between the shoulders, or upon the spinal pro- cesses, in convulsions or palsies of the superior extre- mities, where a stimulus is required. The Twelve Dorsal nerves of each side, as soon as Dorsal' they escape from between the vertebrae, send a branch nerves* forward to join the intercostal, by which a commu- nication is made among them all ; and they soon like-

14 OF THE BONES IN GENERAL. putrescent than the blood or most other parts of ani- mals (a), which is a necessary quality in a substance that is constantly exposed to a considerable degree of heat, and is more in a stagnating condition than the other liquors. Secerning Besides the arteries, which I mentioned already, Arteries, p. 8. to be sent from the bones to the marrow, there is at least one artery for each bone; several bones have more, whose principal use is to convey and secern this oily matter. After these arteries have pierced the solid side of a bone, they are divided into several branches ; wh.:h soon are distributed every where on the internal periosteum, and afterwards spread their branches inwards on the medullary cells, and outwards through the tables of the bone. The blood, which remains after the secretion of the marrow, is returned by proper veins, which are collected from the membranes into one or two large trunks, to pass out at the same holes or passages at which the artery or arteries enter. The general rule of the small vessels decreasing in their capacities as animals advance in age, to which many phenomena in the animal economy are owing, obtains here : For though the trunks of the medullary vessels enlarge as animals turn older; yet the smaller branches become smaller; as is evi- dent from injections, which cannot be made to pass so far in these vessels of adults as of children. Hence the marrow is bloody in children, oily and balmy in mid lie age, and thin and watery in old people. By experiments made on the marrow, when bones of living animals are opened or cut through (b), and from the racking pain with which suppurations with- in bones are frequently attended, we have sufficient proof that the membranes here are sensible, and con- sequently have nerves distributed to them.

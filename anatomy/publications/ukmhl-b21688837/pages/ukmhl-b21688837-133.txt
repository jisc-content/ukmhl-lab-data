91 OF TH.E SKELETON. The superior maxilla* is the common designation Upper jaw; given to the upper immoveable share of the face ; thoughj if we would follow Celsus(a), we should ap- ply the word maxilla to the lower jaw only, and the name mala to this upper jaw. In complaisance to prevailing custom, I shall, however, use the terms as now commonly employed. The shape of the superior jaw cannot easity be expressed; nor is it necessary, provided the shape and situation of all the bones which compose it are described. It is bounded above by the transverse suture, behind by the fore-part of the sphenoid bone, and below by the mouth. The upper jaw consists of six bones on each side, of Component a thirteenth bone which has no fellow, placed in the bones' middle, and of sixteen teeth. The thirteen bones are, two.ossa nasi, two ossa unguis, two ossa malarum, two ossa maxillaria, two ossa palali, two ossa spongiosa inferiora, and the vomer. The ossa nasi are placed at the upper part of the Relative nose ; the ossa unguis are at the internal t canthi of P°sitioD. the orbits; ossa malarum form the prominence of the cheeks ; ossa maxillaria form the side of the nose, with the whole lower and fore-part of the upper jaw, and the greatest share of the roof of the mouth; ossa palali are situated at the back-part of the palate, nostrils, and orbit; ossa spo?igiosa are seen in the lower part of the nares; and the vomer helps to se- parate these two cavities. The bpnes of the upper jaw are joined to the bones Connexion, Df the skull by the schindylesis and sutures already described as common to the cranium and face, and they are connected to each other by gomphosis and lfteen sutures. The gomphosis is only where the teeth are fixed in their sockets, and the schindylesis is only where the edges of the vomer are joined to other bones. • liayuii, y'i\>t>{, hiand bula.

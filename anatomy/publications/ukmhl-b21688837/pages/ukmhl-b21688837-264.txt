OF THE SKELETON. rnnciforme externum, cuneiforme medium, and c unci- forme internum. v The astragaltes is tlic uppermost of these bones The os culcis is below the astragalus, and is con- siderably prominent backwards beyond the oiliest bones to form the heel. The os navicularc is in the middle of the internal side of Jie tarsus *. The oas cuboides is the most external of the row of four bones■ at its fore part t. The os cuneiforme externum placed at the inside J of the cuboid. The cuneiforme ■medium is between the external and internal cuneiform bones, and the internal cuneiform is put at the internal j aide of the foot |[. That the description of these bones may not be im- moderately swelled with repetition, I desire, ence forr all, to observe, That wherever a ridge is mentioned,, without a pai'ticular use assigned, a ligament is un- derstood to be fixed to it : or where a spongy rough 1 cavity, depression, or fossa is remarked, without naming^ its use, a ligament is inserted, and mucilaginous glands-; are lodged : For such will occur in the detail of eachb of these bones. Astragalus The upper part of the astragalus § is formed into aa large smooth head %, which is slightly hollowed \\\. the middle; and therefore resembles a superficial pul- ley, by which it is fitted to the lower end of the tibia. The internal side of this head is flat and smooth, too play on the internal malleolus. The external side haaa also such a surface, but larger, for its articulation with; the external malleolus. Xlaund the base of this head* there is a rough fissa; and, immediately before fliO head, as also below its internal smooth surface, we find a considerable rough cavity. * Distad of the astragalus, on tlte tibial side of the foot.

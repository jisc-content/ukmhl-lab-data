23G APPENDIX. The bones of women are smaller in proportion t<r their length, than those of men ; because the force of their muscles is not so great, nor is such strong exter- nal force applied to them to prevent their stretching out in length. The depressions, ridges, scabrous surfaces, and other inequalities made hy the muscles, are not so conspicu- ous in them j because their muscles are neither so thick nor strong, nor so much employed, as to make so strong prints on their bones. Their 0.9 frond's is more frequently divided by a con- tinuation of the sagittal suture, which depends on the first and second general causes assigned above, for the specialities in their bones ; as will appear after reflect- ing 011 the account given formerly of the middle inter- nal spine of this bone. Their clavicles are less crooked ; because their arms have been less forcibly pulled forwards, which in our European women, especially those of distinction, is more hindered by their garb. Their sternum is mare raised by long cartilages be- low, that the thorax might be there widened in some proportion to what it is shortened hy the pressure upon the diaphragm, when they are with child. The defect of bone, or the hole in the middle of the sternum, is oftenest found in t!. m, to allow the pas- sage of the mammary vessels, s>av some ; but, in my opinion, this is owing to a lax constitution, bv which the ossification is not so soon completed as in men, where the action of the solids is vigorous, and the cir. dilation of the fluids is brisk ; for a much smaller hole might have served this purpose ; and the branches of the internal mammary vessels which are sent to the external parts ol the thorax, do not pass here, but be- tween the cartilages of the ribs, before these are joined to the sternum. The cartilago xiphoides, is oftener bifurcated in wo- men than in men, for the reason assigned in the prece- d'-1 paragraph, viz.. a less forcible power of ossifica-. tion.

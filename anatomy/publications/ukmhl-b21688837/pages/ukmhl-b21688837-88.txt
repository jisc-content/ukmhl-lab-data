46 OF THE SKELETON. When single, and are easily restored to, and kept in their natural situation.—Sometimes the skeleton of the same animal is prepared in both these ways ; that is, the smaller bones are kept together by their natural ligaments, and the larger are connected by wires, or some such substances, lelativesi- Before we proceed to the division and particular matron of description of the skeleton, it is worth while to re- the Boues. that when the bones are put into their natural situation, scarcely any one of them is placed in a perpendicular bearing to another ; though the fabric composed of them is so contrived, that, in an erect posture, a perpendicular line, from their common centre of gravity, falls in the middle of their com- mon base (a). On this account, we can support ourselves as firmly, as if the axis of all the bones had been a straight line perpendicular to the horizon; and we have much greater quickness, ease, and strength in several of the most necessary motions we perform. It is true indeed, that where ever the bones on which any part of our body is sustained, decline from a straight line, the force required in the muscles, to counteract the gravity of that part, is greater than otherwise it needed to have been : But then this is effectually provided for in such places, by the num- ber and strength of the muscles. So long therefore as we remain in the same posture, a considerable number of muscles must be in a constant state ot contraction ; which we know, both from reason and experience, must soon create an uneasy sensation. This we call, being weary of one posture : An incon- venience that we should not have had in standing erect if the b aring of all the bones to each other had been perpendicular ; but is more than compen- sated by the advantages above mentioned. The human skeleton is generally divided into the Head, the Trunk, the Superior, and the Inferior Extremities. («) Cowper, Anat. of Human Bodies, wfelie. ef tab. 87. 88.

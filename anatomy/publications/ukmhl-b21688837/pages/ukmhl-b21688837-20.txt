XIV INTRODUCTORY VIEW Of teal. The term volar, in the atlantal extremities, is restricted, as in common anatomical language, to the parte within the palm of the hand ; while plantar, in the sacral extremities, is in like manner restricted to those within the sole of the foot. Thus, the terms proposed hy Dr Barclay for posi- tion and aspect, are in number twenty-three ; viz. Five peculiar to the head ; coronal, basilar, inial, glabellar, and aniinial. Four to the neck, and trunk ; atlantal, sacral, ster- nal, and dorsal. Two common to head, neck, and trunk ; mesial and lateral. Four peculiar to the Atlantal extremities ; radial, ulnar, anconal, and thenal. Four peculiar to the sacral extremities ; tibial, fibu- lar, rotular, and popliteal. Two common to both sets of extremities ; proximal and distal; and, Two common to the whole body and all its parts, peripheral and central. The terras which have jast been enumerated, are adjectives, referring only to position or aspect. They may, if requisite, be converted into general adjectives, bv changing al or ar into en. Thus, radien, ulnen, tibien, fibulen, will denote something belonging to the radius, ulna, tibia, or fibula. They may be converted into adverbs, denoting di- rection, by changing al or ar into ad. Thus, mesiad implies direction towards the mesial plane ; laterad, the opposite direction, or sideivays ; allantad, towards the atlas, in common language upwards ; .vr/r/W, to- wards the sacrum, or doivnwa?*ds ; glabeHad, sternad, and rotulad, imply directions synonymous vc'ithfor-

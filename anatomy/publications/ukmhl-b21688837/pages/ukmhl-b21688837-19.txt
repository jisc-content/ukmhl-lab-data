xm Barclay's nomenclature. The particular terms refer to the head 3 the trunk -7 the extremities ; and the sanguiferous system. The terms referring to the head, are derived from the corona or top of the head ; the base of the skull; the 7'nwn, or most protuberant pail at the back of the head ; and the glabella, or space between the eye-brows. The aspect or position of those parts next the corona' are .coronal; that of those next the base, basilar' /'that of those next the glabella, glabellar ; and that of those next the inion, inial. The glabella is not at the greatest rectilineal distance from the inion, a distinction, which belongs to the -chin in man, and the muzzle in most inferior animals. These parts are called'by Dr Barclay anti/iion, and the aspect or po- sition that regards them is called antinial. The terms proper to the trunk are also four ; de- rived from the sternum or breast-bone file dorsum or back ; the atlas or first vertebra of the spine ; and the sacrum or rump-bone. According as parts or surfaces respect one or other of these fixed points, they are sternal, do/sal, atlantal, or sacral. The extremities are atlantal or sacral, according as they are situated next the atlas, or next the sacrum. Each pair of the extremities, and each of their com- ponent parts, have a proximal, and a distal end ; the . former being that nearest the trunk, the latter that most remote from it. Four proper terms belong to the atlantal,-and as many to the sacral extremities. Thus, as the former have a radius, an ulna, an ancon, (or olecranon,) and a thenar (orpalm) ; so in these, the aspects and posi- tions arc radial, ulnar, anconal, and thenal. Again ^ m the sacral extremities, there arc a tibia, a fibula * ?°\!ldi and a P°P*>» (or ham); so the aspects and positions here are tibial, fibular, rotular, and popli-

OF THE SKELETON. 169 people, the sternum is a continued bony substance from one end to the other j though we still observe two, sometimes three transverse lines on its surface ; which are marks of the former divisions. When we consider the sternum as one bone, we find it broadest and thickest above, atid becoming smaller as it descends. The internal * surface of this bone is somewhat hollowed for enlarging the thorax; but the convexity on the external! surface is not so conspicuous, because the sides are pressed outwards by the true nbs ; the round heads of whose cartilages are received into seven smooth pits, formed in each side of the ster- num and| are kept firm there b st Iigament ivhich on the external surface have a particular radiated .exture {a).—Frequently the cartilaginous fibres thrust uemselves into the bony substance of the sternum, and ire joined by a sort of suture. The pits at the upper mtofthe sternum are at the greatest distance one rom another, and as they descend, are nearer ; so that He two lowest are contiguous. The substance of the breast-hone is cellular, with very thm external plate, especially on its internal urface, where we may frequently observe a cara- mons crust spread over it (6). On both surfaces owever, a strong ligamentous membrane is closely raced ; and the cells of this bone are so small, that I nsidei-abe quantity of osseous fibres must be em-, oyed m the composition of it: Whence, with the efence winch the muscles give it, and the moveable IS ftl r-fr°T t Cartn^ * ^ sufficiently s ! red from being broken ; for it is strong by its /uan- * Crntra. 4. t»„ .• j. , («'Ruysc1,Ca1alo,.rarfrr,e9PhCral- * (*; Jac.

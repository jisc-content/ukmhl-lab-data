Motions of When therefore the teeth of both jaws coincide, the; Jaw. °W6r confyles are lodged securely in the temporal cavities,, but their motions to either side must be confined both by the firmness of the ligaments, and the rising brims1 which are on each side of the cavities.—When the jaw. is brought directly forwards, the condyles and interme- ■ diate cartilages descend and advance forwards upon the I tubercles.—In this situation the lateral motions are a. little more free than in the former one, from the want: of rising brims to stop the condyles.—When the fore-, teeth of the lower jaw are moved forwards, and to a side, the condyle of the opposite side is either advanced from the cavity to the tubercle, while the condyle of: the same side remains in the cavity ; or if both con- • dyles are on the tubercles, when the jaw is moved ob- • liquely to a side, the condyle of the side to which the motion is made slides back from the tubercle to the cavity.—When the mouth is opened by the descent of the lower jaw, the fore-part of it, where the depressing muscles are fixed, is drawn backwards, as well as downwards, while resistance is made to the angles moving backwards by the masseier and internal ptery- goid muscles, and, at the same time, the external pterygoid draw the condyles and their moveable carti- lages forwards; and therefore, when the mouth is open- ed, the condyles are carried forwards upon the tuber- cles, and the axis of motion of the bone is a little above its angles. But in this situation there is less resistance, than in any other, to the condyles luxating forwards; a disease which seldom happens, except when people are gaping too wide; and therefore the common prac- tice of nurses, who support the jaw of infants when

Division of the nerves 236 OF THE NERVES IN GENERAL. be made ; and there is so little reason to suspect any difference in the texture of the different parts of the brain or nerves, that, on the contrary, the structure is every where similar, and branches of the same nerve often serve both for sensation and motion. How little necessity there is for supposing extreme- ly rapid motions of the nervous fluid, is to be exa- mined soon, 47 The hypothesis of great celerity in the motion of the fluid of the nerves being necessary, gave also bto"arter'i- rise t0 another division of the nerves, into arteries or ous ami ve- effluent, and venous or refluent. It was said, that mus- hous, or cular motion and nutrition depended on the arterious reAu"nt!'ld nerves> and ***** the sensations depended on an ac- celerated motion of the nervous fluid towards the brain, by the impressions which the objects of the senses make upon the venous nerves. By this sup- position the absurdity of rapid fluxes and refluxes in the same canal was prevented, and an advantage was thought to be gained by it, of saving too great a waste of the fluid of the nerves, which otherwise the ence- phalon and spinal marrow could not supply in suffi- cient quantity to answer all the exigencies of life. SnSdered. 48\ To this °Piriion (§ 47') h h"s been objected, 1st, That there is no example in the body of a secret- ed liquor being returned immediately and unmixed to the gland by which it was originally separated from the mass of blood; which would be the case were there venous nerves. 2dly, There is no occasion for saving the fluid of the nerves in the way proposed; the organs for secreting that fluid being large enough to supply all that is necessary of it in the common functions of life.—3dly, If the fluid of the nerves was to be thus kept in a perpetual circulation, it would soon become too acrid for continuing with safety in such sensible tender vessels as those of which the brain and nerves are composed, blhly, This hypothesis will not answer the design for which it was proposed; For though the momentary application of an object might cause an acceleration in the fluid of venous nerves, yet if the object was kept applied to the nerves, it would

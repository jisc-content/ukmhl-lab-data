Ligaments also supply the place of bones in several cases to advantage : Thus the parts in the pelvis are more safely supported below by ligaments, than they could have been by bone.- The ligaments placed in the great holes of the ossa innominata, and between the bones of the fore-arm and leg, afford convenient origin to muscles.—Immoveable bones are firmly con- nected by them ; of which the conjunction of the os sacrum and innominatum is an example. They af- ford a socket for moveable bones to play in, as we see part of the astragalus does on the ligament stretched from the heel-bone to the scaphoid. Numerous inconveniencies may arise from too long or short, strong or weak, lax or rigid ligaments *. artilages Cartilages-f are solid, smooth, white, elastic sub- 2 ' stances, between the hardness of bones and ligaments, and covered with a membrane, named perichondrium, which is of the same structure and use to them as the periosteum is to the bones. Cartilages are composed of plates, which are formed of fibres, disposed much in the same way as those of bones are ; as might be reasonably concluded from observing bones in a cartilaginous state before they ossify, and from seeing, on the other hand, so many cartages become bony. This may be still further confirmed, by the exfoliation to which cartilages are subject, as well as bones. The perichondrium of several cartilages, for exam- ple, those of the ribs and larynx, has arteries which can be equally well injected with those of the perios- teum ; but the vessels of that membrane in other parts, e. g. the articular cartilages, are smaller, and in none of them does injepfcion enter deep into the substance of the cartilages.'ii 'nay, madder mixed with the food ■ « On the ligaments, See Weiehtbrecht's Syndesmologia, and Bichat, Anat.

OF THE BONES IN GENERAL. pocrates (a) might therefore say justly, that a wound penetrating into the cavity of a bone may produce a delirium. The vessels of the marrow, wrapt up in one com- mon coat from the periosteum, pass through the bones by proper canals; the most considerable of which are about the middle of each bone, and are very ob- lique. Sometimes these vessels continue at a little distance in their passage when the canal is divided by a small bony partition or two. From the structure of the contents of the bones, we may judge how these parts, as well as others, may be subject to cedema, phlegmon, erysipelas, sckirr- hus, &c. and may thence be led to a cure of each, be- fore the common consequence, putrefaction, takes place, and frequently occasions the loss of the limb, if not of the patient. The marrow is of very considerable use to the Uses of t: bones ; for by entering their transverse canals, and Marrow, passing from them into the longitudinal ones, it is communicated to all the plates, to soften and connect their fibres, whereby they are preserved from becom- ing too brittle; as we see they do in burnt bones, or those long exposed to the air; in people labouring under old age, pox, or scurvy: In all which cases, the oil is either in too little quantity, or has its na- tural good qualities changed for worse ones. Besides this advantage which the substance of bones has from the marrow, their articulations are said (b) to receive no less benefit from it : for it is thought that the marrow passes into the articular cavities, through the holes which are in the bones near the large joints. And, as a proof of this, it is alleged, that butchers, upon seeing the greater or lesser quantity of marrow, in the bones of cows, can (o) Aphorism. ยง 7. aph. 24.

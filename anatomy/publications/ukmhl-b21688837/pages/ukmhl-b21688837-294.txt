OF THE NERVES IN GENERAL. lected in the receiver of the air-pump; from which it is concluded, that there is no liquor in the nerves. Some, who say they have tried these experiments, affirm, that in young animals the nerve does swell above the ligature, and that a liquor does trickle out upon cutting a nerve.â€”Whether swelling or liquor is seen or is not seen in these experiments, no conclu- sion for or against a nervous fluid can be made from them ; for the swelling of the nerve after it is tied, or the efflux of liquors from its extremity, will never prove either to be the effect of the fluid in the proper nervous fibrils, so long as they might be occasioned by the liquors in the larger vessels of the cellular sub- stance of the nerves; and if these same vessels of the coats of the nerves do not discover their liquors by these experiments, it is far less to be expected, that the much more subtile nerves will discover theirs. 40. The 3d Objection to the doctrine of the brain being a gland, and the nerves its excretories, suppos- es a more rapid motion necessary in the fluid of the nerves, than what most of the defenders of the ner- vous fluid will now allow; and is afterwards to be considered particularly in a more proper place. 41. The 4>ih Objection being, That if nerves are excretories of a gland, they must be cylindrical pipes, in which no obstructions or diseases would happen ; but since we daily see diseases in the nerves, they must therefore not be such excretories. The answer is, That diseases happen often in the excretories of other glands, as of the liver, kidneys, &c. notwith- standing their cylindrical form, and their much short- er and less exposed course. When we consider the very tender substance of the brain, the vast complication of vessels there, the prodigious smallness of the pipes going out from it, the many moving powers which the nerves are to undergo the shock of, and the mauy chances which the vessels, membranes, and cellular substance accompanying the nerves have of being disordered, and then affecting the uervous fibrils, we have very great reason to be surprised, that these cylindrical pipes are not much more frequently put

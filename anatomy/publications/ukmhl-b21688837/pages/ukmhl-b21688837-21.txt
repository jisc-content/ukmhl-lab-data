BARCLAY'S NOMENCLATURE. XV wards ; and iniad, dorsad^ and poplitead imply direc- tions analogous to backwards. The sanguiferous system, in warm-blooded animals, comprehends two distinct sets of cavities and vessels j the one set distined to convey the blood to the lungs, for the restoration of those principles or properties, which it had lost during the general circulation ) the other to distribute the blood, after having been thus renovated in the lungs, to the general system. Hence the former set, including veins, a stnue, an auricle, a ventricle, and arteries, are in Dr Barclay's Nomencla- ture, denominated pulmonic, and the blood which they contain, and which is of a dark colour, is termed pul- monic h\oo<\. In the same manner, the latter set of organs, comprehending also veins, a sinus, an auricle, a ventricle, and arteries, are denominated systemic ; and the florid blood, which they contain, is termed systemic blood. It may be proper to remark, that the merit of this Nomenclature consists, not in the novelty cf the terms, but in the more precise and definite application of terms long in use among anatomists, but hitherto employed in a manner so vague and ambiguous, as to mislead the learner in Human Anatomy, and be almost wholly inapplicable to Comparative. As the terms are drawn from parts long known and described in anatomical works, a knowledge of those parts once acquired leads to the ready application and use of the terms. They are the more easy of apprehension to the anatomist, as being accommodated to an established custom among anatomical writers, of describing the body and its parts as a cube or six-sided figure, whose surfaces point up- wards, downwards, backwards, forwards, to the right and to the left ; and whose parts are situated towards the circumference, the centre, or an imaginary plane*

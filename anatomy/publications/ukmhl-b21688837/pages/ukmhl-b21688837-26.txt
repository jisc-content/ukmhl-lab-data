They are extracted principally from Dr Barclay's Lectures on the Skeleton, and are well calculated not only to facilitate the means of acquiring a more mi- nute and accurate knowledge of the Structure of the. Head, but suggest a mode of establishing new and specific distinctions in Natural History, and Comparative Anatomy, and in ascertaining, with the celebrated.

OF THE BONES IN GENEIIAL. 18 meters, but consisting of an equal number of similar fibres uniformly disposed round each, it is plain, 1. That the absolute force of these two bones is equal, because they consist of equal numbers of si- milar fibres. 2. That the absolute forces of all the fibres in each bone have the same effect in resisting any power applied to break them, as if the sum of all their forces were united in the respective centres of the transverse sections where the fractures are te be made. For, by hypothesis, the fibres being uniformly disposed in each, there is not any fibre in either bone that has not a corresponding fibre; the sum of both whose I distances from the axis of revolution (about which all the parts of the bone must revolve in breaking) | is equal to two semi-diameters of the bone : Conse- â–  quently each fibre, and all the fibres, may be regard-' ed as resisting at the distance of one semi-diameter or radius from this axis, that is, in the centre. 3. Since the united force of all the fibres is to be regarded as resisting at a distance from the eentre? of motion equal to the semidiameter, it follows, that the total resistance of all these fibres, or the strength, i of the bone, is proportional to its semidiameter, andl consequently to its diameter. I have here taken for an example, one of the most! simple cases for calculating the proportional forces l of bones. But, were it not too foreign to the pre-- sent design, it might be universally demonstrated,, that, of whatever figure bones are, and in whatever manner their fibres are disposed, their strength must always be in a ratio, compounded of the area; of their transverse sections, or of their quantity of: bony matter, and of the distance of the centre of: gravity of these sections from the centre of motion or fulcrum, on which the bone is supposed to be: broken (a).

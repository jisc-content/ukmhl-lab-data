In old suhjects, I often see the two hones of the leg grown together at their lower ends. L'scs. The principal use of this hone is to a fiord origin i and insertion to muscles ; the direction of which may he a little altered on proper occasions, by its upper part shuffling backwards and forwards. It likewise helps to make the articulation of the foot more secure: and firm. The ends of the tibia and fibula being; larger than their middle, a space is here left, which is- filled up with such another ligament as I described! extended between the bones of the fore-arm ; audi which is also discontinued at its upper part, where the.- tibialis anticus immediately adheres to the solaeus andl tibialis posticus ; but every where else it gives origin; to muscular fibres (a).

Rotula * is the small fiat bone situated at the fore- part of the joint of the knee. Its shape resembles thet common figure of the heart with its point downwards. The anterior convex surface of the rotula is pierce! by a great number of holes, into which fibres of the. strong ligament that is spread over it enter. Behind,, its surface is smooth, covered with cartilage, and divided by a middle convex ridge into two cavities,-, of which the external t is largest; and both are eM actly adapted to the pulley of the osfimons, on whichii they are placed in the most ordinary unstrainmg pos- tures of the leg-, but when the leg is much bended,! the rotula descends far down on the condyles ; and.

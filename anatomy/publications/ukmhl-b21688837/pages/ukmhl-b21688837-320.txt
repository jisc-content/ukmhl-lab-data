27S OF THE" PARTICULAR NERvX*. relief in the megrim j—why the sight may be lost by an injury doue to the supra-orbitar branch j—how it may be restored by agitation of that branch of this nerve. Superior The second branch of the fifth pair of nerves may »»*ti*ry be called M axillaris Superior, from its serving principally the parts of the upper jaw. It goes out at the round hole of the sphenoid bone, and sends imme- diately one branch into the channel on the top of the antrum maxillare; the membrane of which and the ripper teeth are supplied by it in its passage. As this branch is about to go out at the firemen orbitarium ex- ternum, it sends a nerve through the substance of the on maxillare to come out at Steno's duct, to be distri- buted to the fore-part of the palate ; and what remains of it escaping at the external orbitar hole, divides into a great many branches, that supply the cheek, upper- lip, and nostril. The next considerable branch of the superior maxillary nerve, after giving branches which are reflected through the sixth hole of the sphenoid bone, to join the intercostal where it is passing through the skull with the carotid artery, and the portio dura ofthe^seventh pair, as it passes through the os petro- sum, is sent into the nose by the hole common to the palate and sphenoidal bone ; and the remaining part of this nerve runs in the palato-maxUlariscana), giving off branches to the temples and pterygoid muscles, and comes at last into the palate to be lost. Hence, the ach in the teeth of the upper jaw occasions a gnawing pain deep seated in the bones of the face, with swelling in the eye-lids, cheek, nose and upper lip j and on the other hand, an inflammation in these parts, or a me- grim, is often attended with sharp pain in the teeth. Hence, an obstruction in the duct of the maxillary sinus, which obliges the liquor secreted there to find out a preternatural route for itself may be occasioned by the pain in the teeth. Hence, the' upper lip often suffers when the palate or nose is ulcerated. Inferior The third or Maxillaris Inferior branch of the maxillary fifth paJr going out at the oval hole of-the sphenoid bone, serves the muscles of the lower jaw, and the

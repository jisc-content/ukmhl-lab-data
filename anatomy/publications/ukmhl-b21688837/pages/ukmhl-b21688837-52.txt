10 OF THE BONES IN GENERAL. Harmorrhagics from fungous flesh rising out from the most solid part of a cut bone (a). The regular alternate elevation and subsiding, or apparent pulsation, frequently to be seen in some of the cells of a carious bone. Cells resembling cancelli, sometimes seen in the part of a bone, which, in a natural state, is the most solid and firm [b). A bone as a tube including another bone within it (c) Canals con- On the internal surface of the solid parts of bones, taming there are orifices of canals, which pass outwards through Marrow. tjje plates to open into other canals that are in a lon- gitudinal direction, from which other transverse pas- sages go out to terminate in other longitudinal canals; and this structure is continued through the whole substance of bones, both these kinds of canals be- coming smaller gradually as they approach the outer surface (d). These canals are to be seen to the best advantage in a bone burnt till it is white: When it is broken transversely, the orifices of the longitudinal canals are in view ; and when we separate the plates, the transverse ones are to be observed. Here how- ever we are in danger of believing both these sorts of canals more numerous than they really are; because the holes made by the processes connecting the plates of bones have the appearance of the transverse (e), and the passages for the blood vessels resemble the longitudinal canals. I do not know how we are to- keep free of error about the transverse canals; but think we may distinguish between the two kinds of longitudinal ones ; for the passages of the vessels are largest near the external suface of the bone, and every transverse section of them is circular ; whereas the (a) Medical Essays, vol. 4. art. 21.- \b) Ruysch.

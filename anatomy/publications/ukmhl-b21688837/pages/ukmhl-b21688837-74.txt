3* OF THE BONES IN GENERAL.1 % Compositus. i DiAitTHno- The third class, or diarthrosis*, is the articulation where the bones are so loosely connected as to allow large motion. This is subdivided into three kinds. Enarlhrosis. The first is enarlhrosis, or the ball and socket, when a large head is received into a deep cavity; as the head of the os femoris is into the acetabulum coxendicis. Arthrodia. The second is arthrodia, when a round head is re- ceived into a superficial cavity ; as in the articula- tion of the arm-bone and scapula. These two spe- cies of diarthrosis allow motion to all sides. Ginglimui. The third is ginglimus +, which properly signifies the hinge of a door or window; in it the parts of the bones mutually receive and are received, and allow of motion two ways : Workmen call it charnal. The ginglimus is generally divided into three kinds, to which some (b) give the names of contiguous %, dislant\\, and compound^. The first kind of ginglimus is, when a bone has several protuberances and cavities, which answer to as many cavities and processes of the other bone, with which it is articulated; as in the conjunction of the femur with the tibia. The second species is, when a bone receives an- other at one end, and is received by the same bone at the other end ; as in the radius and ulna. The last sort is, when a bone receives another, and is received by a third; as in the oblique pro- cesses of the vertebra;. When I first mentioned the articulations of bones> I said there were different opinions concerning the use of their technical names, e. g. It has been said, that symphysis should be the name for the immoveable articulations, and synarthrosis should be understood t» * Kxotfifiiti;, dearticulatio, abarticulatio^ •f Aiticulalio mutua.

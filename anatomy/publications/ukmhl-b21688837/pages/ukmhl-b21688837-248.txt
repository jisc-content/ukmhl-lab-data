OF THE SKELETON. Which disposition is the best contrivance for holding xlie largest bodies â€¢, because the longest fingers are ap- plied to the middle largest periphery of such substances as are of a spherical figure (<v). The uses of all the parts of our superior extremities are so evident in the common actions of life, that it ia needless to enumerate them here j and therefore f shall proceed to the last part of the skeleton. Only, lest I should seem to have forgot the small bones afl the joints of the hand, 1 desire now to refer to the de- scription of them, under the common title of sesamoid bom :-, which I have placed after the bones of the feet. OF THE INFERIOR EXTREMITIES. Division. The Inferior Extremities * depend from the ace- tabula of the ossa innominata ; and are commonly di- vided into three parts, viz. the thigh, leg, and foot. Thinh ^e THIGH ^ has only one bone ; which is the Bone. longest of the body, and the largest and strongest of any of the cylindrical bones. The situation of it is not perpendicular : for the lower end is inclined con- siderably inwards so that the knees are almost con- tiguous, while there is a.considerable distance between the thigh-bones above : which is of good use to us, since sufficient space is thereby left for the external parts of generation, the two great cloacce of urine and faces, and for the large thick muscles that move the ' thigh inwards ; and at the same time this situation of the thigh-bones renders our progression quicker, surer, straighter, and in less room ; for had the knees been at a greater distance from each other, we must have been obliged to describe some part of a circle wito the trunk of our body in making a long step, and, when one leg was raised from the ground, our centre of gravity would have been too far from the base of (a) Galen de usu part. lib. 1. cap. 24. * Sacral extremities.

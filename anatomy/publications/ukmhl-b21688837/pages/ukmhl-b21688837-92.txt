50 OF THE SKELETON. Component bones. Sutures. Coronal. Lambdoi da!. monstrous thickness, while the tables of the skulHtte thinner than paper. The cranium consists of eight bones, six of which are said to be proper, and the other two are reckoned common to it and to the face.—The six proper arc the osfronlis, two ossa parielalia, two ossa lemporum, and the os occipitis. rThe common are the os elk- moides and sphcnoides. The os fronlis forms the whole fore * part ot the 1 vault; the two ossa parielalia form the upper and middle part of it; the ossa lemporum compose the lower part of the sides ; the os occipitis makes the whole hinder part, and some of the base; the os ethmoides is placed in the fore part of the base, and the os sphenoides is in the middle of it. These bones are joined to each other by five litres; the names of which are the coronal, lambdoid, sasittal, and two squamous. The coronal\ suture is extended over the head, from within an inch or so of the external % canthus of one eve, to the like distance from the other; which being near the place where the antients vvore their villa?, corona:, or garlands, this suture has hence got its name.—Though the indentations of this suture are conspicuous m its upper part, yet an inch or more of its end on each side has none of them ; for it is squamous and smooth there. _ . The lambdoidal \\ suture begins some way below, and farther back than the vertex or crown of the head, whence its two legs are stretched obliquely downwards, and to each side, m form of the Greek letter a, and are now generally said to extend them- selves to the base of the skull; but formerly anato- mists (a) reckoned the proper lambdoid suture to ter- minate at the squamous sutures, and what is extended » Glabellar.

070 OF THE PARTICULAR NERVES. ves. OF THE PARTICULAR NERVES. IT is generally said, that there are forty pairs of nerves m all j of which ten come out from the encc- phalcm, and the other thirty have their origin from the Spinal morrow*. Ne?ve °ry °f the t6n pa'rS °f nerves "'!>ich conle from tl)e em*- phaltm, the first is tho Olfactory, which long had the name of the mammillary processes of the brain, because m the brutes, cows and sheep, which were most com- monly dissected by the antients, the anterior ventricles of the brain are extended forwards upon these nerves, and adhere so firmly to them, that they seem to make the upper si/Se of the nerves. Each of them being large, where it begins to be stretched out, and gradu- ally becoming smaller as it approaches the cribriform mm*, ™„ S^vi::ff:™b!e a Tho8e mistook the ventricles for part of the nerves, observing the cavity in them full of liquor, concluded, that these olfactory nerves served to convey the superfluous J moisture of the brain to the holes of the ethmoid bone through which it passed into the nose. But in man, the ventricles of whose brain are not thus extended forwards, these nrrves are small, long, and without any cavity, having their origin from the anpora striata^ t , near the part where the internal carotid arteries are- about to send off their branches to the different parts of the brain ; and in their course under toe anterior- lobes of the brain, which have each a depression made for lodging them, the human olfactory nerves become larger, till they are extended to the cribriform bone ; * It is now, move than ever, an object of dispute, whether what are called the cerebral nerves proceed from the eiicephalon, or terminate in that mass. Modern anatomists difi'er much iifl the number of primary pairs; some reckoning nine, others only eight, as immediately connected with the brain. E. f The origin of the olfactory nerves is still a diluted poinf,. Mid appears not to be distinctly acerlainc.'

OF THE SKELETON1. 161 open for the passage of -the wind-pipe, gullet, and large Wood-vessels ; and its lower part, or base, has no bones, and is shorter before than behind so that, to carry on our comparison, it appears like an oblique section of the conoid. Besides which, we ought also to remark, that the lower part of this cavity is narrow- er than some way above (a) ; and that the middle of its back-part is considerably diminished by the bones standing forwards into it The bones which form the thorax are the twelve lUbe. dorsal vertebrae behind, the ribs on the sides, and the sternum before. The vertebrae have already been described as part of the spine ; and therefore are now to be passed. The Ribs, or costce *, (as if they were custodes, or guards, to those principal organs of the animal ma- chine, the heart and lungs,) are the long crooked bones placed at the sides of the chest, in an oblique direction downwards in respect of the back-bone. Their num- ber is generally twelve on each side ; though fre- quently eleven or thirteen have been found (b) Sometimes the ribs are found preternaturally conjoined or divided (c). The ribs are all concave internally ; where they are also made smooth by the action of the contained parts, which, on this account, are in no danger of be- ing hurt by them ; and they are convex externally, that they might resist that part of the pressure of the atmosphere, which is not-balanced by the air within the lungs, during inspiration. The ends of the ribs next the vertebrue are rounder than they are after these bones have advanced forwards, when they become flatter and broader, ami have an upper and lower edge, each of which is made rou£>h by the action of the in- tercostal muscles, inserted into them, These muscles, (a} Albin. de ossib. $ 169. * riX6i/g««, Tfi^ift^va,, tfTK&cii.

OF THE SKELETON. 97 verse suture.—By the edge between the internal and inferior orbitar processes, to the maxillary bone, by the internal orbitar suture.—By the side between the maxillary and inferior orbitar processes, again to the imaxillary bone, by the external orbitar suture.—By ;the zygomatic process, to the os lemporum, by the zygomatic suture. The cheek bones are entire, and fully ossified in all their parts in infants. Ossa Maxillaria Superiora*, are the largest c,„™,- , , , „ ' . , o superior bones, and constitute the far greater part of tr.e up- Maxillary jper jaw, which has appropriated the name of maxiU Bunes, iaria to them. The figure of one of them, or of the [two when joined, is so hregular, that words can scarcely give an idea of it. The processes of each os maxillare may be reckoned procesSQ« seven—Thejirst is the long nasal one at its upper and fore-part, which is broad below, and turns smaller, as it rises upwards, to make the side of the nose.—At the root of this, a transverse ridge may be observed within the nostrils, which supports the fore-part of the upper edge of the 6s spongiosum inferius.—The secondis pro- duced backwards and outwards, from the root of the inasal process, to form the lower side of the orbitj and therefore may be called orbitar.—The edge of this orbitar process, and the ridge of the nasal one, which is continued from it, make a considerable portion of the external circumference of the orbit.—From the proper orbitar process, a very rough triangular sur- face is extended downwards and outwards, to be con- nected to the cheek-bone; and therefore may be call- ed the malar process, from the lowest protuberant part / of which some share of the masscter muscle takes its rise.—Behind the orbitar process, a large tuberosity or bulge of the bone appears, which is esteemed the fourth process.—On the internal part of this we often meet with a ridge, almost of the same height with that in the nasal process, which runs transversely, and is covered by a similar ridge of the palate bone, on " Maxil'ae coronales, Bard.

OF THE BONES IN GENERAL. 3 Bones are composed of a great many plates*, each Intimate of which is made up of fibres or strings united by structuw smaller fibrils (a) ; which being irregularly disposed, and interwoven with the other larger fibres, make a reticular work. This texture is plainly seen in the bones of foetuses, which have not their parts closely compacted, and in the bones of adults which have been burnt, long exposed to the weather, or whose composition has been made loose by diseases. The chinks, which are generally made according to the direction of the larger fibres of bones that have un- dergone the action of fire, or of the weather, shew the greater strength of these than of the fibres which connect them. Numerous accurate observations of the different times in which exfoliations are made from the sides or ends of similar bones, might bid fair to determine what is the proportional force of co- hesion in the two sorts of fibres. The plates are said (6) to be firmly joined to each other by a great number of claviculi, or small bony processes, which, rising from the inner plates, pierce through some, and are fixed into the more external ones. Of these nails, four kinds, viz. the perpendi- cul'ar, oblique, headed, and crooked, have been de- scribed : But in bones fitly prepared, I could see on- ly numerous irregular processes rising out from the plates (c). Though the exterior part of bones is composed of firm compact plates, yet they are all more or less ca- vernous internally. In some (e. g. middle thin part of the scapida and os iliuiri) the solid sides are brought so near, that little cavity can be seen ; and in others (middle of os humeri, femoris, &c.) the cavities are so large, that such bones are generally esteemed to be hollow or fistular.

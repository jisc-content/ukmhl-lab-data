OP THE BONES IN GENERAL. 1<> Since therefore the strength of bones depends on their number of fibres, or quantity of matter, and the largeness of their diameters, one may conclude, that the part of a bone formerly fractured, and re- united by a callus, must be stronger than it was be- fore the fracture happened ; because both these ad- vantages are obtained by a callus; which is a wise provision, since bones are never set in such a good direction as they were naturally of; and then where- ever a callus is formed, there is such an obstruction of the vessels, that if the bone were again broken in the same place, the ossific matter could not so easily be conveyed to reunite it. This callus may indeed, for want of compression, be allowed to form into a spongy cellular substance (a) ; but even in this case, the strength of the bone is here increased by one or both the causes above mentioned. Many bones have protuberances, or processes *, Processes, rising out from them. If a process stands out in a foundish ball, it is called caput, or head.—If the head is flatted, it obtains the appellation of condyle. A rough unequal protuberance, is called tuberosity. When a process rises narrow, and then becomes large, the narrow or small part is named cervix, or neck.— Long ridges of bones, are called spines. Such processes as terminate in a sharp point, have the general name of coronce t, or coronoid, bestowed on them, though most of them receive particular names from the resemblance they have, or are imagined to have, to other substances, e. g. mastoid, styloid, anchoroid, coracoid, spinal, tfc. Such processes as form brims of cavities, are called supercilia J. (o) Ruysch. Thesaur. 8. o. 49. Mus. anat. thee. B. reposit. 2. n.

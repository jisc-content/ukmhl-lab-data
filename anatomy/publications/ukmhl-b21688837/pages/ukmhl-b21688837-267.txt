Under the side of the internal smooth concavity, a particular groove is made hy the tendon of the flexor polticis lon>- gus ; and from the thin protuberance on this internal side, the cartilaginous ligament that supports the astra- galus, goes out to the os naviculare ; on which liga- ment, and on the edge of this bone to which it is fixed, the groove is formed for the tendon of the flexor digi- toritm profundus* The lower surface of this bone is pressed flat at the back-part, by the weight of our bodies ; and immedi- ately before this plane, there are two tubercles, from the internal of which the musculus abductor pollicis, flexor digitoruui sublimis, as also part of the aponeuro- sis plantaris, and of the abductor minimi digiti, have their origin ; and the other part of the abductor minimi digiti and aponeurosisplantaris rises from the external. â€”Before these protuberances this bone is concave, for lodging the flexor muscles and at its fore-part ws may observe a tough depression, from which, and a tubercle behind it, the ligament goes out that prevents this bone from being separated from the os cvboi- des. The fore-part t of the os calcis is formed into an oh* long pulley-like smooth surface, which is circular at its upper external end, but is pointed below. This smooth surface is fitted to the os cuboides. Though the surfaces by which the astragalus and os calcis are articulated, seem fit enough for motion ; yet the very strong ligaments by which these bones are connected, prevent it, and render this principal part of our base, which rests on the ground, to wit, the os cal- cis, firm. A large share of the heel-bone is ossified at the or- State at dinary time of birth, and the large knob appears after- birth, wards in form of an epipkyse. * Flexores digitorum acccssorii. t Distal.

105 OF THE SKELETON. formed into a semilunar plane, to be articulated with the following bone. The internal, posterior, and an- terior edges are rough, for fixing the ligaments that connect it to the surrounding bones. Os lunare * has a smooth convex upper surface, by OsLwian which it is articulated with tbe radius. Tbe internal f side, which gives the name to the hone, is in the form of a crescent, and is joined with the scaphoid;—tbe lower surface is hollow, for receiving part of the head of the os magnum. On the outside % of this cavity is another smooth, but narrow oblong sinuosity, for re- ceiving the upper end of the os tmciforme-: On the outside of which a small round convexity is found, for its connexion with the os cuneiforme. Between the great convexity above, and the first deep inferior ca- vity, there is a rough fossa, in which the circular liga- ment of the joint of the wrist is fixed. Os cuneiforme \ is broader above, and towards the Os Cunei- back of the hand, than it is helow and forwards -.forme. which gives it the resemblance of a wedge. The su- perior slightly convex surface is included in the joint of the wrist, being opposed to the lower end of the ulna. Below this the cuneiform bone has a rou&h fossa, wherein the ligament of the articulation of the wrist is fixed. On the internal side of this bone, where it is contiguous to the os lunare, it is smooth and slightly concave. Its lower surface, where it is contiguous to the os unciforme, is oblong, somewhat spiral, and concave. Near the middle of its anterior surface a circular plane appears, w.Vre the ospisiforme is sustained. Os pisiforme \\ is almost spherical, except one cir- Os Pisi. cuiar plane, or slightly hollow surface, which is cover-/"™*- ed with cartilage for its motion on the cuneiform bone from which its whole rough body is prominent for. t Radial.

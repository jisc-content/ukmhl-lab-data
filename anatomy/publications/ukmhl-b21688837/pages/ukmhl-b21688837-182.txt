140 OF THE SKELETON. small channel in the fore part of the spinal process im- mediately above, which is here connected to it by a li- gament. The conduit of the spinal marrow is here more cir- cular, but corresponding to the size of that cord, is smaller than in any of the other vertebrae and a larger share of the holes in the bony ridges, for the transmis- sion of the nerves, is formed in the vertebra above, than in the one below. The connection of the dorsal vertebrae to the ril)3, the thinness of their cartilages, the erect situation of the oblique processes, the length, sloping, and con- nexion of the spinal processes, all contribute to restrain these vertebrae from much motion, which might disturb the actions of the heart and lungs ; and, in conse- quence of the little motion allowed here, the intervcrli- hral cartilages sooner shrivel, by becoming more solid : And therefore, the first remarkable curvature of the spine observed, as people advance to old age, is in the least stretched vertebrae of the back ; or old people first become round-shouldered. The bodies of the four uppermost dorsal vertebrae deviate from the rule of the vertebrae becoming larger as they descend : for the first of the four is the largest, and the other three below gradually become smaller, to. »lto'w the trachea and large vessels to divide at smaller angles. The two uppermost vertebrae of the back, instead of being very prominent forwards, are flatted by the ac- tion of the mtisci/H l&nkt colli and recti majores. The proportional size of the two little depressions in the body of each vertebra for receiving the heads of the ribs, seems to vary in the following manner : The depression on the upper edge of each vertebra de- creases as far down as the fourth, and after that in- creases. The transverse processes are longer in each lower ■vertebra to the seventh or eighth, with their smooth surfaces, for the tubercles of the ribs, facing gradually more downwards ; but afterwards as they descend.

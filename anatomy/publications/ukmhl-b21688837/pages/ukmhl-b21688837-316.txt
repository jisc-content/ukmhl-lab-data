274 OF THE tAKfiCULAR NERVES. •lines all the inside of the eye as far forwards as the ciliary circle, and is universally known by the name of retina. Though the suhstance of this pair of nerves seems to he blended at the place where they are joined ; yet observations of people whose optic nerves were not joined, and of others who were blind of one eye from a fault in the optic nerve, or in those who had one of their eyes taken out, make it appear that there is no such intimate union of substance ; the optic nerve of the affected side only being wasted, while the other ■was large and plump, And the same observations aie contradictory to the doctrine of a decussation of all the nerves (§ 8.) ; for the disease could be traced from the affected eye to the origin of the nerve on the same- side. In many fishes, indeed, the doctrine of decussa- tion is favoured; for their optic nerves plainly cross oach other, without any union at the part where they are joined in men and most quadrupeds. Those people whose optic nerves were not joined, having neither seen objects double, nor turned their •eyes different ways, is also a plain proof, that the con- junction of the optic nerves will not serve to account for either the uniform motions of our eyes, or our see- ing objects single with two eyes, though it may be one cause of the remarkable sympathy of the one eye with the other in many diseases *;~ Retina. The retina of a recent eye, without any prepara- tion, appears a very fine web, with some blood-vessels coming from its centre to be distributed on it ; but, after a good injection of the arteries that run in the substance of this nerve, as is common to other nerves, it is with difficulty that we can observe its nervous medullary substance. The situation of these vessels in the central part of the optic nerve •, the want of me- dullary fibres here, and the firmness of this nerve be- fore it is expanded at its entry into the ball of the eye, may he the reason why we do not see such bodies, or parts of bodies, whose picture falls on this central part V See Wells on single Vision with two Eyes.

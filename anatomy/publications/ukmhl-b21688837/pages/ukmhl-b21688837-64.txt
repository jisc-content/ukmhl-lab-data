OF THE BONKS IN GENEftAL. 22 by the expansion of the end of the bone itself, to a thickness equal to that of the epiphyses ; but then the constant separation of new plates to form so wide a cellular structure, must have left the solid sides of the bones so thin, as to yield easily, either to the ac- tion of the muscles fixed to them, and passing over them, to the weight several of them are obliged to support, or to the application of any other external force. Several anatomists (a) thought that the epiphyses serve other purposes: such as, securing the liga- ments of the articulations which rise out from be- tween the bones and them; for, as soon as these parts are intimately joined, the ligaments insinuated betwixt them must have a much stronger connec- tion than they could have to the smooth surface of the bones. Such an interception of the ligament between the body of the bone and its epiphyse is not to be seen ; but as, at this place, the bone remains longer soft than any where else, and the adhesion of the periosteum, and of ligaments to bones, is always stronger in proportion to the bones being nearest to the consistence of those parts, which is, being soft- est, the opinion of these writers concerning the stronger connection of the ligaments, where the bones and epiphyses join, is not without some foun- dation. Possibly too, by the fibres of epiphyses not extend- ing themselves so longitudinally as those of the bones, there may be less chance of the former running into each other, than of the latter. The softness of the ends of bones may be of some advantage in the womb, and at birth, after which the ossification begins at different points to form epi- physes, before the ossification can extend from the middle to the ends of the bones (6).

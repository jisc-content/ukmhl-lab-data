OF THE NERVES IN GENERAL. 251 ivrviius fluiJ Fxperi- The doctrine of a fluid in the nerves, is not only ment in h- thus supported by the analogy of the brain and nerves voijr of a to the other glands and their encretories, buttho.se who maintain this doctrine mention an experiment which they think directly proves a fluid in the nerves. It is this : Alter opening the thorax of a living dog, catch hold of and press one or both the phrenic nerves with the fingers, the diaphragm immediately ceases to con- tract ; cease to compress the nerves, and the muscle acts again : A second time, lay hold of the nerve or "nerves some way above the diaphragm, its motion stops. Keep firm hold of the nerve, and, with the fingers of the other hand strip it down from the fingers which make the compression towards the diaphragm, and it again contracts: A repetition of this part of the experiment three or four times, is always attended with the same effects ; but it then contracts no more, strip as you will, unless you remove the pressure, to take hold of the nerves above the place first pinched; when the muscle may again be made to contract, by stripping the nerve down towards it. This experi- ment I have made with the.success here mentioned. Let any one try if he can imagine any other reason- able account of these appearances, than that the pres- sure by the fingers stopped the course of a fluid in the nerve; that so much of this fluid as remained in the nerve, betwixt the fingers and diaphragm was forced into that muscle by stripping, and when it was all pressed away, the fingers above preventing a supply, the muscle contracted no more till the fingers were removed, and a fresh flow by that means was re- ceived from the spinal marrow, or from that part of the nerve which had yet not been so stripped, Â©biections ^ ^ias ^een Ejected to the conclusions from this ' experiment, 1. That the diaphragm is set in motion by stripping the nerve from, as well as towards, this mus- cle; and this may be well expected; for a liquor in such small pipes hindered from flowing backwards by ligature, pinching fingers, or even the flow of their li- quors from the fountain, will regurgitate forwards with

OF THE BONES IN GENERAL. Processes serve for the advantageous origin and insertion of muscles, and render the articulations firm and stable. Before leaving this subject, we must remark, that much the greater number of what are called pro- cesses in adult bones, discover themselves in child- ren to be epiphyses, or distinct bones, which are af- terwards united to the other parts; such are the sty- loid processes of the temporal bones, processes of the vertebra, trochanters of the thigh, &c. However, as I intend to insist chiefly on the description of the adult skeleton, in which the union of these parts is so intimate, that scarcely any vestige remains of their former separation, I shall retain the common appel- lation of apophyse, or process, to all such protuber- ances; but shall remark the principal ones that have no just title to this name, when they occur in the de- scription of particular bones, ©avities On the surfaces of a great many of the bones there and De- are cavities, or depressions : If these are deep, with pressions. iarge brims, authors name them cotylae *. If they are superficial, they obtain the designation of glence, or glenoid. These general classes are again divided into several species : Of which pits are small round- ish channels sunk perpendicularly into the bone.— Furrows are long narrow canals, formed in the sur- face ; niches or notches, small breaches in the bone ; sinuosities, broad, but superficial depressions without brims; fossa;, large deep cavities, which are not equal- ly surrounded by high brims ; sinuses, large cavities within the substance of the bones, with small aper- tures ; foramina, or holes, canals that pierce quite through the substance of the bones.—When this last sort of cavity is extended any long way within a bone, the middle part retains the name of canal, and its ends are called holes. The cavities allow the heads of bones to play in them ; they lodge and defend other parts ; they af- ford safe passage to vessels, muscles, &c.

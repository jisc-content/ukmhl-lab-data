OF THE SKELETON. 93 Meets, by a sort of hook and afterwards by concretion or union of substance in adults, that I did not know well how to rank it: But if any chuses to call it a suture, the addition of two transverse nasal sutures may be made to those above named. These sutures of the face (formerly called harmo- nioe) have not such conspicuous indentations as those of the skull have ; the bones here not having sub- stance enough for forming large indentations, and there being less necessity for security against exter- nal injuries, or any internal protruding force, than in the cranium.—These sutures often disappear in old people, by the bones running into each other; which can do little prejudice, because the principal use of the bones being so numerous here, is to allow them to be extended into a proper form. It is evident, from the manner of the conjunction of these bones, that they can have no motion, except in common with the cranium. The purposes which this pile of bones serves, will be shewn in the description which I am to give of each of them. Ossa Nasi, so named from their situation at the Nasal root of the nose, are each of an irregular oblong square Bones, figure, being broadest at their lower end, narrowest a little higher than their middle, and becoming some- what larger at the top, where they are ragged and thickest, and have a curvature forwards, that their connexion with the frontal bone might be stronger. —These bones are convex externally, and thereby better resist any violence from without; and they are concave internally, for enlarging the cavity of the nose. The lower edge of these bones is unequal, and is stretched outwards and backwards, to join the car- tilages of the nostrils.—Their anterior side is thick, especially above, and unequal, that their conjunction to each other might be stronger; and a small rising may be remarked on their inner edge, where they are sustained by the septum narium.—Their posterior side, at its upper half, has externally a depression,

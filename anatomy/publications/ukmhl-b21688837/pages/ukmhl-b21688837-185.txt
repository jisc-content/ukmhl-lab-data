t OF THE SKELETON. 143 The lumbar vertebrae as they descend, have their oblique processes at a greater distance from each other, and facing more backwards and forwards. Both transverse and spinal processes of the middle- most vertebrae of the loins are longest and thickest ; in the vertebrae above and below they are less : So that these processes of the first* and fifth t are the least, to prevent their striking on the ribs or ossa ilium, or their bruising the muscles in-the motions of the spine. The epiphyses round the edges of the bodies of the lumbar vertebrae are most raised in the two lowest, which consequently make them appear hollower in the middle than the others are. The hody of the fifth vertebra is rather thinner than that of the fourth.—The spinal process of this fifth is smaller, and the oblique processes face more back- wards and forwards than in any other lumbar verte- bra. -After considering the structure of the particular ver- Security icbrae, and their mutual connexion, we may observe", from Lux*- ii solicitous care taken that they shall not be disjoined,tion- -but with great difficulty •, for besides being connected by strong ligaments proportioned to the forces which are to be resisted, their bodies either enter so into each other, as to prevent their being displaced any way, as in the vertebrae of the neck; or they are propped on all •sides, as those of the back are by the ribs ; or their sur- faces of contact are so broad, as to render the separa- tion almost impracticable, as in the loins ; while the depth and articulation of the oblique processes are ex- actly proportioned to the quantity of motion which the other parts of the bones allow, or the muscles can per- form : Yet, as these oblique processes are small, and therefore not capable of so secure a conjunction as the larger bodies, they may sooner yield to a disjoining force ; but then their dislocation is not of nearly so bad consequence as the separation of the bodies would be.

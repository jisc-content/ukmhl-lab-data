OF THE BONES IN GENERAL. 29 c 5 history of the osteogenea more accurate, have since been added by Nesbil (a) and Albimis (b). I must refer to the authors now quoted for the more curious part of the human osteogeny; not having pre- parations enough to give such a full history of it as is done by them. But I shall endeavour to explain the more useful and necessary part of the osteogeny,, by subjoining to the description of each bone of an adult, its condition in ripe children ; that is, in such as are born at the ordinary time; and shall point out what parts of each are afterwards joined in form of epi- physes. This, with the following general rules, seem to me sufficient for understanding what of this subject is necessary in the practice of physic and surgery. 1. Wherever I mention any parts being cartila- ginous, or their being still separable from the other parts of the bone to which they belong, I would be understood to hint, that, about seven or eight years of age, such parts are ossified and united to their proper bones, unless when it is said, that they are afterwards formed into epiphyses. 2. Such as become epiphyses, are generally ossified at seven or eight )'ears of age; but, being for the most part moistened by synovia, their external sur- face is still somewhat cartilaginous, and they are not yet united to their bones. 3. At eighteen or twenty years of age, the epi- physes are entirely ossified, and have blended their fibres so with the body of the bone, as to make them inseparable without violence. The knowledge of this part of the osieoge?iy, I think necessary to prevent dangerous mistakes in the cure of several diseases. As for example : Without this knowledge, the separation of an epipkyse might be mistaken for a fracture or luxation. The inter- stice of two parts of a bone not yet joined, might be judged to be a fissure. A diastasis, or separation (i) Human Osteogeny explained.

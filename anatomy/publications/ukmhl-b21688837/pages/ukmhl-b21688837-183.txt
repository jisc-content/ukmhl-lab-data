Oi! THE SKELETON. they become shorter, and the smooth surfaces are di- rected more upwards. The spinous processes of the vertebrae of the back become gradually longer and more slanting from the first, as far down as the eighth or ninth vertebra; from which they manifestly turn shorter and more erect. The first * vertebra., besides an oblong hollow in its Yhst. lower edge, that assists in forming the cavity wherein the second rib is received, has the whole cavity for the head of the first rib formed in it. The second has the name of axillary^, without any Second thing particular in its structure. The eleventh % often has the whole cavity for the Eleventh eleventh nb in its body, and wants the smooth surface on each transverse process. The twelfth || always receives the whole head of the Twelfth, last nb, and has no smooth surface on its transverse processes, which are very short—The smooth surfaces of its inferior oblique processes face outwards as the lumbar do.—And we may say, in general, that the upper vertebrae of the back lose gradually their resem- hiance to those of the neck, and the lower ones come nearer to the figure of the lumbar. The articulation of the vertebrae of the back with the ribs, shall be more particularly considered alter the ribs are described. Only it may be proper now to re- mark, diat the ligaments which serve that articulation assist in connecting the vertebrae. The lowest order of the true vertebrae is the lumbar $ T , which are live bones, that may be distinguished from Vmebra, many others by these marks: t Their bodies, though o a circular form at their fore-part, are somewhat oblong from one side to the other ; which may he oc- casioned by the pressure of the large vessels, the aorta * Atxplcn, gutturalis. } A^irr,!, in nentiam partem inclinans. || Aiuruffvf, pnacingens. § Offuti tytf, ^oiuv, rcnum, lumboium.

298 ov the Particular nerves. Sciatic. Tho, first, second, and third, after coining thrcn; h the three upper holes in the fore-part of the os sacrum, join together with the fourth and fifth of the loins, to form the largest nerve of the body, which is well known by the name of Sciatic or Ischiatic nerv« i This, after sending huge neives to the different paits of the pelvis, and to the external pints of generation and the podex, as also to the muscles of the hips, passes behind the great tuber of the os ischium, and t!;c u over the quadragemini muscles to run down near to the-- bone of the thigh at its back-part, giving off nerves to the neighbouring muscles and teguments. Some wpt above the ham, where it has the name of thepoplitacus nerve, it sends off a large branch that passes over the fibula, and sinking in among the muscles on the ante- rior external part of the leg, runs down to the foot, to be lost in the upper part of the larger toes, supplying the neighbouring muscles and teguments every where in its passage. The larger branch of the sciatic, after giving branches to the muscles and teguments about the ham and knee, and sending a large cutaneous nerve down the calf of the leg, to be lost at last on the outr side of the foot and upper part of the lesser toes, sinks below the gemellus muscle, and distributes nerves to the muscles on the back of the leg ; among which it continues its course, till passing behind the internal. mcdleolus, and in the internal hollow of the os calcis, it divides into the two plantar nerves: The internal of which is distributed to the toes in the same manner that the radial nerve of the hand serves the concave side of the thumb and fingers ; and the external plan- tar is divided and distributed to the sole of the foot and toes, nearly as the ulnar nerve is in the palm of the hand, and in the concave part of the fingers. Several branches of these nerves, that serve the r«- fcrior extremities, pierce through muscles. By applying what was said of. the nerves in general to the particular distribution of the nerves of the info- rior e.v(re??iities, we may see how people with frac- tured legs, especially where there are splinters, should lie subject to convulsive startings of tbe fractured

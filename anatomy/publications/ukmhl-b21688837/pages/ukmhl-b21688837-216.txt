By thesq causes, the cavity ef the breast is diminished in all its dimensions. Though the motions above described of the ribs and sternum, especially of the latter bone, are so small in the mild respiration of a healthy person, that we c"u scarcely observe them ; yet they are manifest whenever we designedly increase our respiration, or are obliged to do it after exercise, and in several di*. eases.* OF THE SUPERIOR EXTREMITIES. Division. Authors are much divided in their opinions about the number of bones which each superior extremity i should be said to consist of, some describing the ckA vide and scapula as part of it, others classing these- two bones with those of the thorax : But since most- quadrupeds have no clavicles, and the human thoraA can perform its functions right when the scapula iii taken away (a), whereas it is impossible for us to hav.ef the right use of our arms without these bones j I must- - think that they belong to the superior extremities i and therefore shall divide each of them into the shoulder, arm, fore-arm, and hand.

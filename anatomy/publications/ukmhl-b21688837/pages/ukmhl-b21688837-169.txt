OF THE SKELETON. 127 lique bony plate is extended backwards, where theses [neet, the seventh process of the vertebras takes its rise, and stands out backwards : This being generally sharp pointed and narrow edged, has therefore been called spinal process ; from which this whole chain of Dones has got its name. Besides the common ligament which lines all the in- ernal surface of the spinal processes, as well as of the jodies, there are particular ligaments that connect the jony bridges and processes of the contiguous vertebras together. The substance of the processes is considerably stronger ind firmer, and has a thicker external plate than the )odies of the vertebrce. The seven processes form a concavity at their fore- Vertebral iart, which, joined to the one at the back-part of the Canal, jodies, makes a great hole, and the holes of all the vertebrce form a long large conduit *, for containing the spinal marrow.—In the upper and lower edge of each ateral bridge, there is a notch. These are so adapted :o each other in the contiguous vertebrce, as to form a •ound hole in each side hetween each two vertebrce, .trough which the nerves that proceed from the spinal narrow and its blood vessels pass. The articulations then of these true vertebrce are Artieula- )lainly double j for their bodies are joined by the in-tions. ervening cartilage above described, and their oblique irocesses being tipped with cartilages, are so connect- :d by their ligaments, as to allow a small degree of notion to all sides. Hence it is evident, that their centre of motion is altered in different positions of the ;runk : For when we bow forwards, the upper moved )art bears entirely en the bodies of the vertebrae : If sve bend back, the oblique processes support the weight : If we recline to one side, we rest upon the ahlique processes of that side and part of the bodies : tf we stand erect, all the bodies and oblique processes, lave their share in our support. * 'l£ga toyyt, <ru\nv, Canalis.

©F THE SKELETON". 347 by a process sent up from the back-part of the os coccygis, and joined to t he little knobs which the last bone of the os sacrum has instead of a spinal process. Under this bridge or jugum, the twenty-ninth pair of spinal nerves runs in its course to the common holes just now described. The upper part of the body of the first bone re- sembles the vertebrae of the loins ; but the small fifth bone is oblong transversely and hollow in the middle of ^ its lower surface. The substance of the os sacrum is very spongy, Substance, without any considerable solid external plates, and" is lighter proportionally to its bulk than any other bone in the body j but is secured from injuries by the thick muscles that cover it behind, and by the strong ligamentous membranes that closely adhere to it.— As th is is one of the most remarkable instances of this sort of defence afforded a soft weak bone, we may make the general observation, That, wherever we meet with such a bone, one or other, or both these de- fences are made use of y the first to ward off" injuries, and the second to keep the substance of the bone from yielding too easily. This bone is articulated above to the last vertebra Connection Bl the loins, in the manner in which the lumbar verte- brae are joined and therefore the same motions may be performed here. The articulation of the lower part the os sacrum to the os epccygis seems well enough idapted for allowing considerable motion to this last >one were it not much confined by ligaments. La- erally, the os sacrum is joined to the ossa ilium by an mmoveable synchondrosis, or what almost deserves the '.ame of a suture -j for the cartilaginous crust on the urfaee of the bones is very thin, and both their surfa- ces are so scabrous and unequal, as to be indented into geh other ; which makes such a strong connexion, hat grea force is required to separate them, after all ne muscles and ligaments are cut. Frequently the wo bones grow together in old subjects. •.The uses of the os sacrum are, to serve as the corn- ion b tse and support of the trunk of the body, to

OF THE SKELETON. Go between the eye and a clear light, it appeared like a sieve.—In the orbit of the generality at skeletons, we may observe on., two, or more holes, which allow a passage to a hog's bristle through the skull. The place, size, and number of these, are however uncer- tain : They generally serve for the transmission of small arteries or nerves, internal or -phe internal surface of the os fronds is concave, Surface except at the orbitar processes, which are convex, to support the anterior lobes of the brain. This surface is not so smooth as the external; for the larger branches of the arteries of the dura mater make some furrows in its sides and back parts. The sinuosities from the luxuriant risings of the brain, mentioned when de- scribing the general structure of the cranium, are of- ten very observable on its upper part ; and its lower and foreparts are marked with the contorsions of the anterior lobes of the brain.—Through the middle of this internal suiface, where always in children, and sometimes in old people, the bone is divided, either a ridge stands out, to which the upper edge of the/<z/x is fastened, or a furrow runs, in which the upper side of the superior longitudinal sinus is lodged : on both these accounts chirurgical authors justly dissuade the application, of the trepan here The reason of this difference in skulls, is alleged by some authors to be this, That in thin skulls the ridge strengthens the bones, and in thick ones there is no occasion for it. To this way of accounting for this phenomenon, it may justly be objected, that generally very thick skulls have a large spine here, and frequently thin ones have only a furrow. Perhaps this variety may be owing; to the different times of complete ossification of those parts in different subjects : For if the two sides of this bone meet before they arrive at their utmost extent of growth, they unite very fii mly, and all their fibres endeavour to stretch themselves out where the least resistance is, that is, between the hemispheres of the brain. To support this reasoning, we may re- mark, that those adults, whose frontal bone is divid-

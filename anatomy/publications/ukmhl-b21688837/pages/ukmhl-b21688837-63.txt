OV THE BONES IN GENERAL. 51 (&) Vcsal.

To far the greater number of bones, whose ends are not joined to other bones by an immoveable ar- ^ ticulation, there are smaller ones annexed, which af- terwards become scarcely distinguishable from the substance of the bone itself. These are called epi- physes, or appendices*. Some bones have one, others have two, three, or four of these appendices annexed by the means of cartilages, which are of a consider- able thickness in children, but by age become thin- ner ; the ossification proceeding from the end of the bone on one side, and from the epiphyses on the other, till at last, in adults, the place of their conjunction can scarcely be seen on the external surface; and it is only sometimes that we can then see any mark of distinction in the cancelli (a). Several processes (e. g. trochanters of the thigh, spine of the scapula, &c.) have epiphyses; and pro- cesses frequently rise out from epiphyses; for exam- ple, at the lower end of the femur, ulna, tibia, &c. (ft)- The epiphyses are united chiefly to such bones as Their us&s. are destined for frequent and violent motion; and for this purpose they are wisely framed of a larger diameter than the bone they belong to ; for by this means, the surface of contact between the two bones of any articulation being increased, their conjunc- tion becomes firmer, and the muscles inserted into them act with greater force, by reason of their axes being further removed from the centre of motion. These advantages might indeed have been obtained * Applantatio, additamentum, adnascentia, adnexum, pe- rone. (a; Winslow, Exposition anatomique de corps humain, traite des os sees. ยง 116.

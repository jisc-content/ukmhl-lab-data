Of THE SKELETON. 173 of the ribs, is pushed forwards, and that at its several parts, in proportion to the length and motions of its supporters, the ribs ; that is, most at its lower end. The sternum and the cartilages, thus raised forwards, must draw the diaphragm connected to them ; conse- quently so far stretch it, and bring it nearer to a plane. The power that raises this bone and the cartilages, fixes them sufficiently to make them resist the action of the diaphragm, whose fibres contract at the same time, and thrust the viscera of the ablomen down- wards. The arched part of the ribs being thus moved outwards, their anterior ends and the sternum being advanced forwards, and the diaphragm being brought nearer to a plain surface, instead of being greatly con- vex on each side within each cavity of the thorax, it is evident how considerably the cavity, of which the nine or ten upper ribs are the sides, must be widened, and made deeper and longer. While this is doing in the upper ribs, the lower ones, whose cartilages are not joined to the sternum or to other cartilages, move very differently, though they conspire to the same in-, tention, the enlargement of the thorax : For having no fixed point to which their anterior ends are fastened^ and the diaphragm being inserted into them at the place where it runs pretty straight upwards from its origin at the vertebrae, these ribs are drawn down- wards by this strong muscle, and by the muscles of the abdomen, which, at this time, are resisting the stretching force of the bowels ; while the intercostal muscles are pulling them in the contrary direction, to wit, upwards : The effect therefore of either of these powers, which are antagonists to each other, is very little, as to moving the ribs either up or down ; but the muscles of the abdomen, pushed at this time out- wards by the viscera, carry these ribs along with them. Ihus the thorax is not only not allowed to be shortened, but is really widened at its lower part, to assist in making sufficient space for the due distension or the lungs. As soon as the action of these several muscles ceases, the clastic cartilages extending themselves to.

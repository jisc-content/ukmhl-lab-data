OF THE SKELETON. 94 • Lateral. E. is overlapped some way by the maxillary bones, while its lower half covers these bones: By which contriv- ance, they do not yield easily to pressure applied to their fore-part or sides. A small hole is frequently to be observed on their external surface, into which two, three, or four holes, which appear internally, terminate for the transmis- sion of small veins ; sometimes the holes go no fur- ther than the cancelli of the bones. The nasal bones are firm and solid, with very few cells or cancelli in them ; the thin substance of which they consist not requiring much marrow. They are joined above to the frontal bone, by the middle of the transverse suturebehind, to the maxillary bones, by the lateral nasal sutures ;—-be- low, to the cartilages of the nose;—before, to each other, by the anterior nasal suture ;—internally, to the septum narium. These bones serve to cover and defend the root of the nose. In an infant the nasal bones are proportionally shorter, and less thick at their upper-part, than in au adult, but are otherwise complete. Ossa Ua- Ossa Unguis, or Lacrimalia, are so named, be-, s'lU' cause their figure and magnitude are something near to those of a nail of one's finger, and because the tears pass upon them into the nose. Their external* surface is composed of two smooth concavities and a middle ridge.—The depression be- hind forms a small share of the orbit for the eye-ball to move on, and the one before is a deep perpendicular canal, or fossa, larger above than below, containing part of the lacrymal sac and duct. This is the part that ought to be pierced in the great operation for the fistula lacrymalis. This fossa of the bone is cribri- form, or has a great number of small holes through it, that the filaments from the membrane which lines it, insinuating themselves into these holes, might prevent a separation of the membrane, and secure the bone in

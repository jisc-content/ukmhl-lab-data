8 OP THE BONES IN GENERAL. ends, but pass through them to the marrow.——As animals advance in age, the arteries of the bones become less capacious; as is evident, 1. From the bones of adults having less blood in them than those of children have. 2. From many of them becom- ing incapable, in old age, of admitting the colour- ed powders used in injections, which easily pass in youth. And, 3. From the bones of old creatures being more difficultly tinged with madder than those of young ones. If authors have not mistaken, the arteries of bones have sometimes become very large (a). We may conclude from arteries being accompanied with veins so far as we can trace them in every other part of the body, that there are also veins in the bones ; nay, the veins of bones can sometimes be injected and then seen (6). Nerves. The bones of a living animal are so insensible, that they can be cut, rasped, or burnt, without put- ting the creature to pain, and the nerves distribute ed in their substance cannot be shewn by dissection ; from which it might be inferred that they have no nerves distributed to them : But the general tenor of nature, which bestows nerves on all the other parts, should prevent our drawing such a conclu- sion. And if sensibility is a sure proof of nerves en- tering into the composition of any part, as it is ge- nerally allowed to be, we have sufficient evidence of nerves here in the bones ; for the granulated red flesh which sprouts out from them, after an ampu- tation of a limb, or performing the operation of the trepan, or after an exfoliation, is exquisitely sensible: And, in some ulcers of bones, where the periosteum was all separated, the patient suffered racking pain, if the bone was touched with a rough instrument; nor was he free from pain after the bone was perforated (c), (a) Diemerbroelc.

*7 OF THE SKELETON. OF THE HEAD. ijBythe Head is meant all that spheroidal part which is placed above the first bone of the neck. It there- fore comprehends the cranium and bones of the face. The cranium *, helmet, or brain-case, consists of Cranium, iseveral pieces, which form a vaulted cayity, for lodg- ing and defending the brain and cerebellum, with itheir membranes, vessels, and nerves. The cavity of the cranium is proportioned to its Contents. Hence such a variety of its size is ob- served in different subjects; and hence it is neither so broad nor so deep at its fore-part, in which the anterior lobes of the brain are lodged, as it is behind, where the large posterior lobes of the brain, and the whole cerebellum, are contained. The roundish figure of the skull, which makes it Figure, more capacious, and better able to defend its contents from external injuries, is owing chiefly to the equal pressure of these contained parts as they grow and increase before it is entirely ossified. It is to be observed, however; that the sides--of the cranium are depressed below a spherical surface by the strong temporal muscles, whose action hinders here the uniform protrusion of the bones, which is more equal- y performed in other parts, where no such large mus- ses are. In children, whose muscles have not acted nuch, and consequently have not had great effects m the bones, this depression is not so remarkable ; ind therefore their heads are much rounder than in idults. These natural causes, differently disposed in Jifferent people, produce a great variety in the shapes )f skulls, which is still increased by the different ma- nagement of the heads of children when very young: So that one may know a Turk's skull by its globular figure, a Germa?i's by its breadth and flatness of the • K«y%ot, xurn, ku2(ik, rxatpim, ealva, calvaria, cerebri galea, heca et olla capitis, testa capitis, scutella capitis.

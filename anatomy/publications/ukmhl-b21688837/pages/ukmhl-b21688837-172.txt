OF THE SKELETON-* 130 one or more vertebra;, or their cartilages, are of un- equal thickness in opposite sides, the spine must be reclined over to the thinner side; which now sustaining the greatest share of the weight, must still be more compressed, consequently hindered from extending it- self in proportion to the other side, which, being too- much freed of its burden, has liberty to enjoy a luxu-i riant growth. The causes on which such an inequality of thickness in different sides of the vertebrae depends! may vary : for either it may be owing to an over-, distension of the vessels of one side, and from thence a preternatural increase of the thickness of that part; or, which more commonly is the case, it may proceed* from an obstruction of the vessels, by which the ap-> plication of proper nourishment to the bony substance is hindered ; whether that obstruction depends on the- faulty disposition of the vessels or fluids, or if it is produced by an unequal mechanicaL pressure, occa-i sioned by a paralytic weakness of the muscles and 1m gaments, or by a spasmodic over-action of the muscles- on any side of the spine, or by people continuing long,: or putting themselves frequently into any posture de< dining from the erect one : In all these cases one conK mon effect follows, to wit, the ver tebrae, or their car-r tilages, or both, turn thick ou that side where the ves-s sels are free, and remain thin on the ether side where the vessels are straitened or obstructed. Whenevei any morbid curvature is thus made, a second turn.' but in an opposite direction to the former, must bo formed j both because the muscles on the convex side of the spine being stretched, must have a stronger na- tural contraction to draw the parts to which their ends are fixed, and because the patient makes eflorts td keep the centre of gravity of the body perpendiculai to its base, that the muscles may be relieved irom s constant violent contractile state, which always createli uneasiness and pain. .â–  When once we understand how these crooked spni* are produced, there is little difficulty in forming a jusfc prognosis ; and a proper method of cure may be eas* h contrived, which must vary as to the internal rnc

198 OF THE SKELETON^ In the description of the preceding eight bone-s, 11 have mentioned only those plain surfaces covered^! with cartilage, by which they are articulated to each, I other, or to some other bones, except in some fcwjl cases, where something extraordinary was to be ob- 1 served ; and I have designedly omitted the othee. J rough surfaces, lest, by crowding too many words in j the description of such small bones, the whole should-J be unintelligible : But these scabrous parts of the ] bones may easily be understood, after mentioning j their figure-, if it la observed, that they are generally found only towards the back or palm of the hand y that they are all plain, larger behind than before ; and that they receive the different ligaments, by which they are connected either to neighbouring bones, or to, one another 3 for these ligaments cover all the bones, and are so accurately applied to them, that, at fir6t view, the whole carpus of a reGent subject appears one smooth bone (a). Figure of As the surfaces of these bones are largest behind,, the Carpus the figure of the whole conjoined must be convex- there, and concave before ; which concavity is still more increased by the os pisiforme, and process of the os unctforme, standing forwards on one side, as the ira- pez-wm does on the other : And the bones are securely lent in this form, by the broad strong transverse ligal meat connected to these parts of them that stand pro- minent into the palm of the hand. ; The convexity be- hind renders the whole fabric stronger, where it is most exposed to injuries; and the large anterior ho] low is necessary for a safe passage to the numerou^ vessels, nerves, and tendons- of the fingers. The substance of these bones is spongy and cellnj 1 ir, but strong in respect of their bulk. ,r â€¢ The three first bones of the carpus make an oblong head by which they are articulated with the cavity at the lower ends of the bones of the fore-arm j so as p. 5-68:

OF THE SKELETON. from the points of these processes to the astragalus and os calcis. When the foot is bended, as far as commonly it is when we stand, no lateral or rotatory motion is allowed in this joint; for then the head of the astragalus is sunk deep between the malleoli, and the ligaments are tense y but when the foot is ex- tended, the astragalus can move a little to either side, and with a small rotation. By this contrivance the foot is firm, when the weight of the body is to be sup- ported on it y and when a foot is raised, we are at li- berty to direct it more exactly to the place we intend next to step upon. The astragalus is joined below, to the os calcis ; and before, to the os nuciculare, in the . manner to be explained, when these bones are de- scribed. State at considerable share of this bone is ossified in a new birth. born infant. Heel-bone. Calcaneum * is the largest bone of the seven. Be- hind, it is formed into a large knob, commonly called the heel: The surface of which is rough behind, where the tench Achillis is inserted into it j and above, it is hollow and spongy. Farther forwards, on the upper surface of the calcaneum, there is an irregular oblong, smooth convexity, adapted to the concavity at the back-part of the astragalus: And beyond this a nar- row fossa is seen which divides it from two small con- cave smooth surfaces, that are joined to the fore-part of the astragalus. Behind the posterior of these smooth surfaces, which is the largest, a small sinuosity is made by the tendon of the flexor digitorum longus j at the- fore-part of which a small rough protuberance ap- pears, that gives rise to the musculus extensor cl/'gilo- rum brevis. The external sidef of tins bone is flat, with a super - ficial fossa running horizontally, in which the tendon of the musculuspe.ronmis longus is lodged. The inter- nal J side of the heel-bone is hollowed, for lodging the # Os calcis. cT=fÂ»* alcar, pedis. \ Fibular. E. 1 Tibial. E,

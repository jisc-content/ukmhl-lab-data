THE ANATOMY OF THE HUMAN BONES. PART I. OF THE BONES IN GENERAL. 33 ones are covered by a membrane, named on that Per account Periosteum*, which is so necessary to them, that we must examine its texture and uses, before we can understand their structure. The periosteum, as well as most other membranes, can be divided into layers of fibres. The exterior f ones, composed of the fibres of the muscles connect* ed to the bones, vary in their number, size, and di- rection, and consequently occasion a very great dif- ference in the thickness and strength of the perios- teum of different bones, and even of the different parts of the same bone. The internal J layer is every where nearly of a similar structure, and has its fibres in the same direction with those of the bone to which they are contiguous. Ought not then the name pe* nosleum to be applied, strictly speaking, only to this * Membrana circumossalis, omentum ossibus imposituai. T Peripheral of Barclay. E. X Central Bard. E. B

138 OF THE SKELETON. beginning of the spinal marrow would have been in i danger of being twisted, and of suffering by the com- pression this would have made on its tender iiljiils. It is necessary to observe, that the lateral or mode- rator ligaments confine so much the motion of the first ■vertebra upon the second,, that, though this joint mayi serve us on several occasions, yet we are often obliged! to turn our faces farther round, than could be done by this joint alone, without the greatest danger of twist- ing the spinal marrow two much, and also of luxating, the oblique processes ; therefore, in large turns of thia« kind, the rotation is assisted by all the vertebrae of the neck and loins ; and if this is not sufficient, we em- ploy most of the joints of the lower extremities.—This- combination of a great many joints towards the per- formance of one motion, is also to be observed ini several other parts of the body ; notwithstanding such-i motions being generally said to be performed by somee single joint only *. 5d4th,5ih ^'ie tmr(* vertebra of the neck is by some called and6th. axis; but this name is applied to it with much less reason than to the second.—This third, and the three- helow, have nothing particular in their structure \ butt all their parts come under the general description for- merly given, each of them being larger as they de- scend. Seventh. The seventh t vertebra of the neck is near to the form of those of the back, having the upper and lower: surfaces of its body less hollow than the others :---The oblique processes are more perpendicular;—neither: spinal nor transverse processes are forked. This - seventh and the sixth vertebra of the neck have the hole in each of their transverse processes more fre- quently divided by a small cross bridge, that iroes be- tween the cervical vein and artery, than any of the other vertebrae. * See Barclay's Muscular Motions, p. 512.

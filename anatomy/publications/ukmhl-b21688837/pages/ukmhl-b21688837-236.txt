194 OF THE SKELETON. without explaining the order they observe, differently apply the same numbers, and so confound their readers. But that tlie description of these bones may .he in the same order as they are found in the generality of anatomical books, I shall begin with the range erfi 'bones that are concerned in the moveable joint of the. -wrist-,- or are connected to the fore-arm, and shall after-- wards consider the four that support the thumb audi ossa mctacarpi of the fingers. The eight bones of the carpus are, os scaphoides,, lunare, cuneiforme, pis/forme, trapezium, trapezoidesR ■auagn win, u tic if or me. The scaphoides is situated most internally * of those that are articulated with the fore-arm. The lunare \s< immediately on the outside t of the former. The- cuneiforme is pleased still more externally, but does- not reach so high up as the other two. The pisijorme stands forwards into the palm from the cuneiforme %. The trapezium is the first of the second row §, and is ■situated betwixt the scaphoides and first joint of the thumb. The trapezoides is immediately on the outside of the trapezium.. The 0.9 magnum is still more ex- ternal. The unciforme is farther to the side of the< little finger. GsScapJioi- Os scaphoides \\ is the largest of the eight except; des- -one. It is convex above, concave and oblong below; .from which small resemblance of a boat it has got its name. Its smooth convex surface is divided bv _f rough middle fossa, which runs obliquely cross it; The upper largest division is articulated with the radius, into the fossa the common ligament of the joint of the wrist is fixed ; and the lower division it joined to the trapezium and trapezoides. The eon cavity receives more than a half of the round heat 1 of the os magnum. The external side of this hollow v * Most Racliiul. E. 4 TJlnad.

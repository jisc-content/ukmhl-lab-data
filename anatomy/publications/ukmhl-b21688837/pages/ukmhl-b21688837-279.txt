237 APPENDIX. The superior cartilages of the ribs sooner ossify, to support the weight of the mamma'. The middle cartilages are more flat and broad bv -the weight of the breasts. The inferior cartilages are longer, for enlarging the chest. Weak women, who have born many children when young, often have the vertebrae of th.'ir back .bended forwards, and their sternum depressed, or become round shouldered and flat breasted (a) by the pressure and weight of the impregnated uterus, and by the strong action of the abdominal muscles. The os sacrum is broader and turned much more backwards, for enlarging the pelvis. The os coccygis is more moveable, and much less bended forwards, to facilitate the birth. The ossa ilium are more hollow, and more reflected outwards, and consequently further removed from each other, in order to widen the lower part of their abdomen, and for the better support of the impregnated uterus. The ridge on the upper part of the os pubis is larger in such women as have born children, being extended by the strong action of the musculi recti abdominis. The cartilage between the two ossa pubis, especially in women who have born children, is thicker than in men, by which the pelvis is mere capacious in females. The conjoined surfaces of the ossa pubis, and of the ossa innominata and sacrum are less, the angle under the symphysis of the ossa pubis, is much larger, and the arches formed below and behind by the ossa ilmm and ischium are wider, which, with the straighter os sacrum, and more distant tubcra ischii, leave a larger- passage for the exclusion of the child in birth. The great tuberosity of the ossa ischium, is flatter in women than in men, because it is more pressed up- on in the sedentary life which females enjoy. In consequence of the pelvis of women being wider, the articulations of their thigh-bones must be farther removed from each other; and therefore a larger space (a) Chesdden, Anatomy, book 1. chap. 5.

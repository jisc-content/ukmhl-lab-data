OF THE SKELETON. 139 The twelve dorsal* may be distinguished from the Dorsal other vertebrae of the spine by the following marks : Verteb: Their bodies are of a middle size, betwixt those of the neck and loins they are more convex before than either of the other two sorts ; and are flatted la- terally by the pressure of the ribs, which are inserted into small cavities formed in their sides. This flatting on their sides, which makes the figure of these verte- brae almost an half oval, is of good use; as it affords a firm articulation to the ribs, allows the trachea arteria to divide at a small angle, and the other large vessels to run secure from the action of the vital organs.--- These bodies are more concave behind than any ot the other two classes.-—Their upper and lower surfaces are horizontal. The cartilages interposed between the bodies of these vertebrae are thinner than in any other of the true vertebrae ; and contribute to the concavity of the spine in the thorax, by being thinnest at their fore- part. The oblique processes are placed almost perpen?- dicular ; the upper ones slanting but. a little forwards, and the lower ones slanting as much backwards.-— They have not so much convexity or concavity as is worth remarking.—Between the oblique processes of opposite sides, several sharp processes stand out from the upper and lower parts of the plates which join to form the spinal process into these sharp processes strong ligaments are fixed, for connecting the vertebrae. The transverse processes of the dorsal vertebrae are long, thicker at their ends than in the middle, and turned obliquely backwards y which may be owing to the pressure of the. ribs, the tubercles of which arc inserted into a depression near the end of the e pro- cesses. The spinal processes are long, small pointed, and sloping downwards and backwards-, from their upprr and back-part a ridge rises, which is received by a turis, tergi.

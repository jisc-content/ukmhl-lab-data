OF THE SKELETON. ]37 l fling easily in a circular way on the superior oblique processes of the second, and its bodv or anterior arch having a rotation on the tooth-like process, by which the perpendicular ligament that is sent from the point of the tooth-like process to the occipital bone is twisted, while the lateral ligaments that fix the pro- cessus dentatus to the sides of the first vertebra, and to the os occipitis, are very differently affected 3 for the one upon the side towards which the face is turned bv the circumgyration is much shortened and lax, while the opposite one is stretched and made tense, and yielding at last 110 more, prevents the head from turn- ing any farther round on this amis. So that these la- teral ligaments are the proper moderators of the cir- cumgyratio of the head here, which must be larger or smaller, as these ligaments are weaker or stronger, longer, or shorter, and more or less capable of being- stretched.â€”Besides the revolution on this axis, the first vertebra can move a small way to either side 3 but is prevented from moving backwards and forwards, by its anterior arch, and by the cross ligament, which are both closely applied to the tooth-like process. Motion forwards here would have been of vav bad consequence, as it would Lave brought the beginning of the spinal marrow upon the point of the tooth-like process. The rotatory motion of the head is of great use to US on many accounts, by allowing us to apply quickly our organs of the senses to objects : and the axis of rotation was altogether proper to be at this place ; for if it had been at a greater distance from the head, the weight of the head, if it had at any time been re- moved from a perpendicular bearing to the small very moveable joint, and thereby had acquired a long lever, would have broken the ligaments at every turn inconsiderably performed y or these ligaments mail, have been formed much stronger than could have been, connected to such small bones. Nor could this cir- cular motion be performed on the first vertebra with- out danger, because the immoveable part of the me- dulla oblongata is so near, that at each large turn, the

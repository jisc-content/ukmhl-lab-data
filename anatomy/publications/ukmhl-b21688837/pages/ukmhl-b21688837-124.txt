82 OF THE SKELETON. forwards, and with a pendulous convex one below..- The upper and lower edges terminate in a sharp point behind.—The side of this pendulous spongy part next to the septum narium is convex, and its external side is concave.—These two processes of the ethmoid bone have got the name of ossa spongiosa, or turbinata su- periora, from their substance, figure, and situation. C annexion. All the prominences, cavities, and meanders of this ethmoid bone, are covered with a continuation of the membrane of the nostrils, in a recent subject.—Its horizontal cribriform plate is lodged between the or- bitar processes of the frontal bone, to which it is join- ed by the ethmoid suture, except at the back-part; where it is connected with the cuneiform bone, by a suture common to both these bones, though it is ge- nerally esteemed part of the sphenoidal.—Where the ossa plana are contiguous to the frcntal bone within I he orbit, their conjunction is reckoned part of the transverse suture.—Farther forward than the ossa plana, the cells are covered by the ossa unguis, which are not only contiguous to these cells, but cannot be separated from them, without breaking the bony sub- stance; and therefore, in justice, those bones ought to be demonstrated as part of the ethmoid bone.—Be- low the ossa unguis and plana, these cells and ossa spongiosa are overlapped by the maxillary bones.— The cellular part of each palate bone is contiguous to each os planum and cells backwards.—The lower edge of the nasal perpendicular plate is received into the furrow of the vomer.—Its posterior edge is joined to the fore-part of the processus azygos of the sphe- ?ioid bone.—Its upper edge joins the nasal process of the frontal and nasal bones, and its anterior one is connected to the middle cartilage of the nose. Uses. From all which, the uses of this bone are evident, viz. to sustain the an»erior lobes of the brain; to givet passage to the olfactory nerves, and attachment to the- j'alx ; to enlarge the organ of smelling, by allowing the membrane of the nose a great extent; to straiten the passage of the air through the nose, by leaving only a narrow winding canal, on the sensible mem-

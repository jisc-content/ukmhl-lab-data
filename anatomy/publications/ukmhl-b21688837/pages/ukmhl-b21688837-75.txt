OP THE BONES IN GENERAL. 33 c 5 be the conjunction of bones by some connecting me- dium. Those who have taken symphysis m the sense I did, of its expressing the conjunction of bones with a connecting substance, have disagreed in their definition of it; some inserting, and others leaving out, its allowing motion.—Where they have agreed in their definition, they have not been of the same mind concerning' the species of it. For several think the Syssarcosis and syndesmosis applicable to so many joints which are universally allowed to be classed un- der the diarthrosis, that it must create confusion to name them by any species of the symphysis Few keep to such a general definition of the synchondrosis as I have done ; and, whether they determine it to allow no motion, or an obscure or a manifest one, bring themselves into difficulties, beca\ise there are examples of all these three kinds. Some again, by too nicely distinguishing obscure and manifest motions of bones, have blended the synarthrosis and diar- throsis, and from thence have branched out the dif- ferent compound species of articulations that may be formed of them so far, that they could find no ex- amples in the body to illustrate them by .-—It would be tedious to enumerate more of the jarring opinions, and it would be far more so to give a detail of the arguments used by the disputants. It is sufficient for my purpose, that it is understood in what sense I take these technical terms ; which I do in the fol- lowing manner. When I mention the symphysis or synarthrosis; or any species of them, I shall always understand them according to the explication already given of them. But though the preceding account of the diarthrosis, or articulation of moveable bones, has been almost universally received ; yet, seeing it does not compre- hend all the moveable articulations of the body, and one of its species does not answer to any notion we can have of the conjunction of two bones, I must beg leave to change the definitions and kinds of these joints.

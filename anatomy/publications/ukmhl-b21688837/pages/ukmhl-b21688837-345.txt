OF THE LACTEAL SAC AND DUCT. 305 The diameter of the duct is various in most bodies, and is seldom uniform in the same subject; but fre- quently sudden enlargements or sacculiof. it are observ- able. The divisions which authors mention of this duct are very uncertain. I have seen it divided into two, whereof one branch climbed over the fore-part of the aorta at the eighth vertebra of the thorax, and at the fifth slipped behind that artery, to join the other branch which continued in the ordinary course. The,precise vertebra, where it begins to turn to the left side, is also uncertain. Frequently it does not split ?«t its superior arch •, in which case a large sac is found near its aper- ture into the subclavian vein. Generally it has but one orifice .though I have seen two in one body, and three in another : Nay, sometimes it divides into two, under the curvature of the great artery ; one goes to the right, another to the left subclavian vein ; and I have found this duct discharging itself entirely into the right subclavian. The lymphatic vessel which enters its superior arch, is often sent from the thyroid gland (<*>. Is not the situation of the receptacitlum chrjh so much nearer the muscular appendices of the diaphragm in men than in brutes, designed to supply the disad- vantageous course the chyle must otherwise have in our erect posture ? Do not the descent of the end of the duct to the subclayian vein, and the opening of the-lymphatic into the top of the arch, contribute to the ready admission, of the chyle into that vein ?

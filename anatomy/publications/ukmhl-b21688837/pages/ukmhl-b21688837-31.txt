BONES OF THE HEAD-. The Ethmoidal, of their Coronal, Mesial, and La- teral. The Sphenoidal, of the Coronal, Inial, and Lateral. The Nasal, of the Glabellar or Anfinial. The superior-Maxillary, of the Lateral and Basilar. The Lacrymal, of the Lateral.' The inferior Spongy, of the Lateral. The Vomer, of the Mesial. ASPECTS OF THE MOUTH The superior Maxillary constitutes a portion of the Lateral, Coronal, and Antinial Aspects. The inferior Maxillary, of the Lateral and Antinial. The Palatal,, of the Coronal. A small portion~of the Pterygoid Process of the Sphe- noidal, a part of the Coronal and Lateral. The Teeth, a part of the Lateral and Antinial. v. In different Species these Bones vary their forms,., their aspects, their number of connexions, and the mode and number by which they enter into the forma- tion of these different Cavities ; and hence become a source of those important specific distinctions, which-, in Natural History and Comparative Anatomy, are so useful and necessary in. ascertaining the species ofr Fossil Heads. THEIR GENERAL CONNEXIONS. The Frontal is articulated with four of the Cranium-} The two Parietal, The Ethmoidal, and The Sphenoidal. With eight of the Face ; The two Malar,

OP THE BONES IN GENERAL. s i. 9. internal layer, to which the others are joined in an uncertain manner and number ? Some authors (a) endeavour to prove the internal layer of fibres of the periosteum to be derived from the dura mater : For, say they, since the membrane covering the skull is plainly a production or conti- nuation of the dura mater, which passes out between the sutures; and since there are muscles on the head, as well as in other parts, which might furnish a periosteum, it is needless to assign different origins to membranes which have the same texture and uses. They add further, in proof of this doctrine, that the periosteum extends itself along the ligaments of the articulations from one bone to another; and there- fore is continued from its origin over all the bones of the body.â€”While anatomists were fond of the hypothesis of all membranes being derived from one or other of the two that cover the brain, a dispute of this kind might be thought of consequence : But now that the hypothesis is neglected as useless, it is needless to examine the arguments for or against it. Except where muscles, cartilages, or ligaments are inserted into the periosteum, its external surface is connected to the surrounding parts by thin cellular membranes, which can easily be stretched consider- ably, but shorten themselves whenever the stretch- ing force is removed. When these membranes are cut off or broken, they collapse into such a small space, that the surface of the periosteum seems smooth and equal. When we attempt to tear off the periosteum from bones, we see a great number of white threads pro- duced from the membrane into them ; and, after a successful injection of the arteries with a red liquor, numerous vessels are not only seen on the periosteum, (6), but most of the fibres sent from the membrane (a) Havers, Osteolog. nov. disc.

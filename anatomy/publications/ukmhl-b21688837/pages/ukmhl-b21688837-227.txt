OF THE SKELETON. 185 on each side ; These are called cojidyles \ from each of which a strong ligament goes out to the bones of the fore-arm. The external * condyle, which has an ob- lique direction also forwards in respect of the internal f, when the arm is in the most natural posture (a), is equally broad, and has an obtuse smooth head rising from it forwards. From the rough part of the condyle, the inferior head of the bicornis %, the extensor digilo- rum communis, extensor carpi ulnaris \, anconeus, and some part of the supinator radii brevis, take their rise ; and on the smooth head the upper end of the radius plays. Immediately on the outside of this, there is a sinuosity matle by the shorter head of the bicornis muscle, upon which the musculur nerve is placed. The internal condyle is more pointed and protuberant than the external, to give origin to some part of the flexor carpi radialis ||, pronator radii teres, palmaris longus, flexor digitoritm svblimis, and flexor carpi uhiaris Between the two condyles, is the trochlea or pully, which consists of two lateral protu- berances, and a middle cavity, that are smooth and covered with cartilage. When the fore-arm is ex- tended, the tendon of the internal brachicevs muscle is lodged in the fore-part of the cavity of this pully.— The external protuberance, which is less than the other, has a sharp edge behind 5 but forwards, this ridge is obtuse, and separated from the little head, al- ready described, only by a small fossa, in which the joined edges of the ulna and radius move. The in- ternal protuberance of the pully is largestand highest ; and therefore in the motions of the ulna upon it, that bone would be inclined outwards, was it not supported by the radius on that side. Between this internal pro- * Radal. E. f Ulnar. E. (a) Winslow, Memoires de 1'acad. des sciences, 17'22. t Radialis externus. Alb. E. § Ulnaris externus. Alb. E. || Radialis internus. Alb. E.

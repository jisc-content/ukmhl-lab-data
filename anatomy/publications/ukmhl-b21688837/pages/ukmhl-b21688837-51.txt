OP THE BONES IN GENERAL. 9 B 5 —-The reason why the nerves of rigid hard bones become insensible, is, That all nerves mast have a con- siderable degree of flexibility at the part where ob- jects are applied, otherwise it cannot be affected by their impressions. We see this illustrated in a very common analogous case ; the growth of a new nail: When the former one has suppurated off, the thin membrane which first appears, is-exquisitely sensi- ble ; but gradually becomes dull in its sensation, till it can be cut or scraped, without causing pain, after it is formed into a hard naif. From what has been said of the vessels of bones, Growth ana it is evident, that there is a constant circulation ofD"ay. fluids in every part of them ; and that there is a per- petual waste and renewal of the particles which com- pose the solid fibres of bones, as well as of other parts of the body ; the addition from the fluids ex- ceeding the waste during the growth of the bones ; the renewal and waste keeping pretty near par in adult middle age; and the waste exceeding the- sup- ply from the liquors in old age; as is demonstrable from their weight: For each bone increases in weight, as a person approaches to maturity; continues of nearly the same weight till old age begins, and then becomes lighter. The specific gravity of the so- lid sides, on the contrary, increases by age ; for then they become more hard, compact, and dense. In consequence of this, the bones of old people are thin- ner and firmer in their sides, and have larger cavities than those of young persons. The vascular texture of bones must make them Morbid ap- subject to obstructions, ecchymoses, ulcers, gangrenes, ''"j™06/ an,d-most other diseases with which the softer parts are affected; and therefore there may be a greater variety of caries than is commonly described (a.)

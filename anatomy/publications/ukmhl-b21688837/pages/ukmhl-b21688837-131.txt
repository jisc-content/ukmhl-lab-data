OF THE SKELETON. 89 Viird hole is formed between the base of this bone and the root of the orbitar process of the palate bone of ach side. Through this a branch of the external ea- otid artery, and of the second branch of the fifth pair f nerves, are allowed a passage to the nostrils, and a eturning vein accompanies them. Sometimes, hovv- ver, this hole is proper to the palate-bone, being len- rely formed out of its substance. Under the sella Turcica, and some way farther for- 'ard, but within the substance of the sphenoid bone, re two sinuses;, separated by a bony plate. Each of lem is lined with a membrane, and Opens into the pper and back part of each nostril by a round hole, •Inch i.s at their upper fore-part. This hole is not >rmed only by the os sphenoides, which has an aper- xre nearly as large as any transverse section of the nus, but also by the palate bones which are applied ) the fore-part of these sinuses, and close them up; lat hole only excepted, which was already mention- i. Frequently the two sinuses are of unequal dimen- ons, and sometimes there is only one large cavity, ith an opening into one nostril. These cavities are kewise said (a) to be extended sometimes as far back 5 the great foramen of the occipital bone. In other ibjects they are not to be found, when the bone is smposed of large cells (b). Some(c) mention a ca-. ity within the partition of the sinuses; but it is small, 'he sphenoidal sinuses serve the same uses as the •ontal do. As this bone is extremely ragged and unequal, so Substance s substance is of very different thickness, being in ome places diaphanous ; in others it is of a middle lickness, and its middle back-part surpasses the reatest share of the cranium in thickness. The os sphenoides is joined, by its wings, to the pa- Connexion ielal bones above, to the o? fronds and ossa malaium efore, to the temporal bones behind ; by the fore- fa) Albin de ossib. § 39.

152 OF THE SKELETON. The oblique processes of these hones of the neck, more justly deserve that name than those of any other vertebrae. They are situated slanting; the upper ones- - having their smooth and almost flat surfaces facing obliquely backwards and upwards, while the inferior oblique processes have these surfaces facing obliquely forwards and downwards. The transverse processes of these vertebrae are fram- ed in a different manner from those of any other bones of the spine : For besides the common transverse pro- cess rising from between the oblique processes of each side, there is a second that comes out from the side of the body of each vertebra ; and these two processes, after leaving a circular hole for the passage of the eu- vical artery and vein, unite, and are considerably hol- lowed at their upper part, with rising sides, to protect the nerves that pass in the hollow ; and at last each side terminates in an obtuse point, for the insertion o£.F muscles. The spinal processes of these cervical bones stand \ nearly straight backwards, are shorter than those of any other vertebrae, and are forked or double at their r ends ; and hence allow a more convenient insertion too muscles. The thick cartilages between the bodies of theses cervical vertebrae, ike obliquity af their oblique pro- cesses, and the shortness and horizontal situatien of i 1 their spinal processes, all conspire to allow them large motion. The holes between the bony cross bridges, for the passage of the nerves from the spinal marrow, have their largest share formed in the lowest of the two ver-f tcbrae, to which they are common. S» far most of the cervical vertebrae agree ; but thejn have some particular differences, which oblige us t«l consider them separately. The first, from its use of supporting the head. ha*< the name of atlas * ; and is also called eju'sirophca, from the motion it performs on the second.

Itt properly enough named hyoicles, from the resemblan-i it bears to the Greek letter v, and may, for a clear demonstration of its structure, be distinguished into.; body, eornua, and appendices. Body The body is the middle broad part, convex behw and hollow behind.—The convex fore-part is divid into two, by a ridge, -into the middle of which t mylo-hyoidei, and into the sides the stylo-hyoidn, mi cles are inserted.—Above the ridge, the bone is ho zontal, but pitted in the middle by the insertion ■the two gmioihyoidei muscles, and a little hollo* more laterally by the basio-glossi.-Below' the ndj it is convex, but a little flatted in the middle by - sterno-hyoiSet, and pitted more externally by the raco-byoidci.—The concavity behind faces backwa, and downwards to receive the thyroid cartilage, wl l t arm. 5. obs. 519. - Fauchard.

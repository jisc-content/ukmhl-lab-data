I OF THE BONES IN GENERAL. 27 From the foregoing account of the structure of Various bones, and of their ossification, we may understand l)henot»' o i■ r ii u fxplainc the reasons of the following phenomena. How the natural colour of bones may be changed by some sorts of food (a). Why the bones of some people are so long in hard- ening, and in others never completely indurate. Why, in such whose ossification is slow, the bones are generally thicker in proportion to their lengths, especially at their ends ; as in the rickets. How hard firm bones have become soft and pliable by diseases (b). Why in some diseases, epiphyses separate from bones (c), and the ends of fractured bones come as- under many years after their fractures appeared to be cured (rf). How bones may waste and diminish (e). How bones may become solid all through, without any appearance of cancelfi ( f). How nodes, tophi, and exostoses, happen after the erosion of the external plates of bones in the lues ve- nerea, scurvy, rheunmiism, and gout. How bones exfoliate by the rising of granulated flesh from their surface. How and from what callus is formed after a frac- ture (g). (a) Philosoph.

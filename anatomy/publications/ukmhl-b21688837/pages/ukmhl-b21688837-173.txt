OF THE SKELETON.' dicines, according to the different causes on which the disease depends : But one general indication must be pursued by surgeons; which is, to counteract the bending force, by increasing the compression on the convex part of the curvature, and diminishing it on the concave side. The manner of executing which in particular cases must be different, and requires a very accurate examination of the circumstances both of the disease and patient. In many such cases, I have found some simple directions, as to postures in which the patient's body should be kept, of very great ad- vantage. Though the true vertebrae agree in the general Difler- structure which I have hitherto described; yet, because ences. of several specialities proper to a particular number, they are commonly divided into three classes, viz. cer- vical, dorsal, and lumbar *. The cervical + are the seven uppermost vertebrae ; Cervical which are distinguished from the rest by these marks. Vertebrae Their bodies are smaller and more solid than any others, and flatted on the fore part, to make way for the (esophagus ; or rather this flat figure is owing to :he pressure of that pipe, and to. the action of the longi jolli and anterior recti muscles. They are also flat lehind, where small processes rise, to which the in- ternal ligaments are fixed. The upper surface of the )ody of each vertebra is made hollow, by a slanting .hin process which is raised on each side : The lower lurface is also excavated, but in a different manner ; or here the posterior edge is raised a little, and the one aefore is produced a considerable way. Hence we see low the cartilages between those bones are firmly con- lected, and their articulations are secure. The cartilages between these vertebrae are thick, specially at their fore part; which is one reason why :he vertebrae advance forward as they descend, and. lave larger motion. * See Barcl. Muscul.

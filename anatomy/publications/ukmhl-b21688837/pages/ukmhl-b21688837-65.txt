OF THE BONES IN GENERAL. 23 they were once cartilages, membranes, nay, a mere jelly. This needs no further proof, than repeated observations of embryos when dissected : And how much more tender must the boiies be before that time, when neither knife nor eye is capable of dis- covering the least rudiments of them ! By degrees they become more solid, then assume the nature of gristles, and at last ossify; the cohesion of their plates and fibres always increasing in proportion to their increased solidities; as is evident from the time necessary to unravel the texture of bones of people of different ages, or of dense and of spongy bones, or of the different parts of the same bone, and from the more tedious exfoliations of the bones of adults than of children. After any part of a bone is fully ossified, its fibres are extended little more in length at that part, though they increase there in thickness, and though their softer parts continue to become longer (a). As the solidity of bones increases, their periosteum more easily separates from them. When bones are membranous, the periosteum and they cannot be dis- tinguished ; they appear to be the same substance. When they are cartilages, their membrane adheres so firmly to them, that it is difficult to separate it from them. Where the rigid bony fibres are, the periosteum is easily taken off.â€”Is the similarity of structure and consequent greater attraction of the membrane and substance it incloses, while they are both flexible, the cause of their greater adhesion ? or is it owing to the vessels that go from the one to the other being then larger ? or do both these causes combine to produce this effect? Or is the mem- brane or cartilage, which becomes bone afterwards, to be considered as the same substance with the pel riosteum (6) ? and must all these plates of bones be (a) Hales's Vegetable Statics, p. 293 Du Hamel Me- moires de I'aead. des sciences, 1742.

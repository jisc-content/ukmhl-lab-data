OF THE SKELETON. 119 â€”Sometimes these shoulders are joined to the sides of the fifth bone of the os sacrum, to form the hole in each side common to these two bones, for the passage to the twenty-ninth pair of spinal nerves. Immedi- ately below the shoulders of the os coccygis, a notch may be marked in each side, where the thirtieth pair of the spinal nerves passes. The lower end of this bone is formed into a small head, which very often h hollow in the middle. The three lower bones gradually become smaller, and are spongy j but arc strengthened by a strong liga- ment which covers and connects them. Their ends, by which they are articulated, are formed in the same manner as those of the first bone are. Between each of these four bones of young subjects a cartilage is interposed ; therefore their articulation is analogous to that of the bodies of the vertebrae, of the neck: For, as has been above remarked, the lower end of the os sacrum, and of each of the three superior bones of the os coccygis, has a small depres- sion in the middle ; and the upper part of all the bones of the os coccygis is a little concave, and consequently, the interposed cartilages are thickest in the middle, to fill up both cavities by which they connect the bones more firmly. When the cartilages ossify, the upper end of each bone is formed into a cavity, ex- actly adapted to the protuberant jower end of the bone immediately above. From this sort of articulation, it 'is evident, that, unless when these bones grow top-ether, all of them are capable of motion j of which the first and second, especially this last, enjoys the largest share. The lower end of the fourth bone terminates in a rough point, to which a cartilage is appended. To the sides of these bones of the os coccygis, the coc- cygrei muscles (a), and part of the levators am and of the glutei' maximi, are fixed. (a) Douglas, Myograph, chap. 40.. Eustacli. tab.

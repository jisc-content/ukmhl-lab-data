OF THE SKELETON. JQ$ then the quickness and large extent of these two mo- tions are assisted by the ulna, which, as was before ob- served, can move with a kind of small rotation on the sloping sides of the pulley. This lateral motion, though very inconsiderable in the joint itself, is con- spicuous at the lower end of such .a long bone ; and the strong ligament connecting this lower end to the carpus, makes the hand more readily obey these mo- tions. When we design a large circular turn of our hand, we increase it by the rotation of the os humeri, and sometimes employ the spine and inferior eziremi- tics, to make these motions of pronation or supination of the hand large enough *. The Hand t comprehends all from the joint of theKand. wrist to the point of the fingers. Its back part is con- vex, lor greater firmness and strength ; and it is con- cave before, for containing more surely and conve- niently such bodies as we take hold of. One half of the hand has an obscure motion in comparison of what the other has, and serves as a base to the moveable halt j which can be extended back very little farther than to a straight line with the fore-arm, but can be consuleraoly bended forwards. As the bones that compose the hand are of different shapes and uses, while several of them that are con- tiguous agree in some general characters-, the hand is, on this account, commonly divided into the carpu- metacarpus fingers ; among which last the thumb is reckoned. The Carpus % is composed of eight small spmgf Carpus bones S1tuated at the upper part of the hand. I shall wZt desenbe each of these bones, under a proper name taken from their figure („) 5 because the method of rangmg them by numbers leaves anatomists too much at liberty 0 debate very idly, which ought to be pre- ferred to the hrst number ; or, which is worse, several, * See Barcl.

OF THE SKELETON. 19? eda*es of which are however so raised hefore and he- i hind, that a sort of pulley is formed, where it sustains the os mctacarpi indicia. Os magnum?* so called because it is the largest hone Os Mag. of the carpus, is oblong, having four Quadrangular num. sides, with a round upperf end, and a triangular plain one below. J—The round head is divided by a small rising, opposite to the connexion of the os scaphoides and lunare, which together form the cavity lor receiv- ing it.—On the inside a short plain surface joins the os- magnum to the trapezoides.—On the outside is a long narrow concave surface, where it is contiguous to the os unciforme. The lower end, which sustains the metacarpal bone of the middle finger, is triangular, slightly hollowed, and farther advanced on the internal side than on the external, having a considerable ob- long depression made on the advanced inside by the metacarpal bone of the fore-finger; and generally there is a small mark of the os raetacarpi digiti annu- laris on its external side. Os unciforme\\ has got its name from a thin broad 0s jjnci. process that stands out from it forwards into the palm,/orac. and is hollow on its inside, for affording passage to tire tendons of the flexors of the fingers. To this process also the transverse ligameut is fixed, that binds down and defends these tendons ; and the fic.vor and ab- ductor muscles of the little fing- r have part of their origin from it. The upper plain -surf;'.ce is small, convex, and joined with the os lunarc :—The internal side is long, and slightly convex, adapted to the con- tiguous magnum .-—The external surface is oblique, and irregularly convex, to be articulated with the cuneiform hone : The lower end is divided into two concave surfaces ; the external is joined with the me- tacarpal bone of the little finger, and the internal one is fitted to the metacarpal bone of the ring-finger. * Maximum, capitatunu t Proximal. 1£.

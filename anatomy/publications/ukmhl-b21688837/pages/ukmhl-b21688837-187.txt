Th crum There are only two oblique processes of the os sa- P urn; one standing out on each side from the upper part of the first bone—Their plain erect surfaces face backwards, and are articulated with the inferior ob- lique processes of the last vertebra of the loins, to which each of these processes is connected by a strong ligament, which rises from a scabrous cavity round their roots, where mucilaginous glands are also lodged. —Instead of the other oblique processes of this bone four rough tubercles are to be seen on each side of its surface behind, from which the musculus sacer * has its origin. The transverse processes here are all grown together into one large strong oblong process on 'each side < which so far as it answers to the fVst three bones is ^ery thick, and divided into two irregular cavities, by i long perpendicular ridge.—The foremost of the two cavities has commonly a thin cartilaginous skin cover- ing it in the recent subject, and is adapted to the un- gual protuberance of the os ilium, and a strong ]J£a_ nent connects the circumference of these surfaces of :he two bones. The cavity behind is divided by a ransverse ridge into two, where strong ligamentous tongs, that go from this bone to the os ilium with a ellular substance containing mucus, are lodged. lhese transverse processes of the two last bones of \\e os sacrum *ve much smaller than the former — U their back-part near their edge, a knob and oblong [at surface give rise to two strong ligaments which ire extended to the os ischium^ and are therefore ailed sacrosciatic.

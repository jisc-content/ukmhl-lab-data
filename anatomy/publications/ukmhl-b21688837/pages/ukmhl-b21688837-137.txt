OP THE SKELETON. 95 s natural situation.—The ridge between these two avities of the os unguis, is the proper boundary of the rbit at its internal canlhus; and beyond which sur- eons should not proceed backwards in performing Derations here.—The internal * or posterior surface 'this bone consists of a furrow in the middle of two mvexities. I The substance of the os unguis is as thin as paper, id very brittle; which is the reason that these bones e often wanting in skeletons, and need little force I pierce them in living subjects. Each of these bones is joined, above, to thefronial me, by part of the transverse suture;—behind, to e os planum oi the ethmoidbone, by the same suture; ^before, and below, to the maxillary bone, by the crymal suture.—Internally, the ossa unguis cover me of the sinus ethmoidals; nay, are really contin- s with the bony lamella which make up the sides these cells; so that they are as much part of the hmoid bone as the ossa plana. These unguiform bones compose the anterior inter- 1 parts of the orbits, lodge a share of the lacrymal c and duct, and cover the ethmoid cells.—Their uation and tendersubstance make a rash operator in nger of destroying a considerable share of the organ smelling, when he is performing the operation of the 'ulalacrymalis; but when these bones are hurt, they it off without much difficulty, and consequently the und is soon cured, unless the patient labours under ;eneral cacoetha, or there be a predisposition in the les to caries ; in which case, a large train of bad riptoms follows, or, at best, the cure proves tedious. 1 nese bones are fully formed in a new born child. Ussa Malarumt was the name given by Celsus, Cheek was already remarked, to,all the upper jaw ; but is Bonei- v appropriated to the prominent square bones which m the cheek on each side.—Before, their surface is Mesial.

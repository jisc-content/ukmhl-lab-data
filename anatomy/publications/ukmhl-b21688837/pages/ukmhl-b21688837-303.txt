THE NERVES IN GENERAL. 26l the nerves (whatever name people please to give it) is a principal instrument which the mind makes use of to influence the actions of the body, or to inform itself of the impressions made on the body, we must allow that the mind can direct this instrument dif- ferently, particularly as to quantity and celerity, though we must remain ignorant of the manner how many phenomena depending on this connexion of mind and body are produced. Thus we would in vain attempt to account for animals continuing, after their heads were struck off or their hearts were cut out, to perform actions begun before they, suffered any injury 62. Let us now suppose the nervous fluid such as has been argued for, to wit, a very fluid saponaceous water, moving in a constant, equal, slow stream, from the encephalon and spinal marrow, in each of the pro- per nervous fibres, except when the motion is changed by some accessory cause, such as the mind, pressure of other parts, &c. and Jet us examine how well such a supposition will agree with the phenomena of the three great functions, nutrition, sensation, and muscular motion, which the nerves are principal in- struments of. 63. In general, we may say, that nerves can carry fluids to the most minute part of the body, to supply what is wasted in any of the solids ; that the impreci- sion made by the objects of the senses on the very soft pulpy extremities of the nerves of the organs of the senses, must make such a stop in the equal-flowing nervous fluid, as must instantaneously be perceptible at the fountain-head from which the pipes. affected arise; that the constant flow of the liquor of the nerves into the cavities of the muscular Jibrillw, occasions the natural contraction of the muscles, by the as constant nisus it mukejsto increase the transverse and to shorten the longitudinal diameter of each fibre ; and that it is only to allow the mind a power of determining a greater quantity of this same fluid with a greater velocity into what muscular fibres it pleases, to acÂ« count for the voluntary strong action of the muscles.

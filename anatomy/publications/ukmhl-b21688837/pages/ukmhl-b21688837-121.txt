OP THE SKELETON. 79 thin, as in many skulls to be diaphanous : But then these muscles ward off' injuries, and the ridges and spines, which are frequent here, make it sufficiently strong to resist ordinary forces. The tables and diploe are tolerably distinct in this bone, except where it is so thin as to become diaphanous. The occipital bone is joined above to the ossa pa- Connexion. rietalia and triqucira when present, by the lambdoid suture ;—laterally to the temporal bones, by the ad- diiamenla of the lambdoid suture;—below to the sphe- noid bone, by the end of its cuneiform process, in the same way that epiphyses and their bones are joined: For in children a ligamentous cartilage is interposed between the occipital and sphenoid bones, which gra- dually turns thinner, as each of the bones advances, till their fibres at last run into each other; and, about sixteen or eighteen years of age, the union of these two bones becomes so intimate, that a separation can- not be made without violence,—The os occipilis is joined by a double articulation to the first vertebra of the neck, each condyle being received into a superior oblique process of that vertebra. What motion is al- lowed here, we shall consider afterwards, where the vertebrce are described. The uses of this bone appear from the preceding JXsbs. description, and therefore need not be repeated. An infant born at the full time, has this bone di- State at vided, by unossified cartilages, into four parts The Billh- first of these is larger than the other three, is of a triangular shape, and constitutes all the part of the bone above the great foramen. Generally fissures appear in the upper part and sides of this triangular bone, when all the cartilage is separated by macera- tion ; and sometimes little distinct bones are seen to- wards the edges of it.—The second and third pieces ot this bone are exactly alike, and situated on caclv side of tne great foramen ; from which very nearly the whole condyles are produced ; and they are ex- tended forwards almost to the forepart of the hole for the ninth pair of nerves.—The fourth piece is the cuneiform process, which forms a small share of the

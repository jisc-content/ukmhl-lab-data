In consequence, however, ot the weight of the body bearing so obliquely on the joint of the knee, by this situation of the thigh-bones, weak rickety children become in-knee'd. The upper * end of the thigh-bone is not continued Upper in a straight line with the body of it, but is set off^J^ obliquely inwards and upwards f, whereby the dis- tance here between these two bones at their upper- part is considerably increased. This end is formed in- to a large smooth round head t, which is the greater portion of a sphere unequally divided. Towards its lower internal || part a round rough spongy pit is ob- servable, where the strong ligament, commonly, but unjustly, called the round one, is fixed,'to be extended from thence to the lower internal § part of the receiv- ing cavity, where it is considerably broader then near to the head of the thigh-bone. The small part below the head, called the cervix, of the osfemoris, has a great many large holes into which the fibres of the strong ligament, continued from the capsular, enter, and are thereby surely united to it; and round the root of the neck, where it rises from the bone, a rough ridge is found, where the capsular ligament of the ar- ticulation itself is connected.—Below the back-part of this root, the large unequal protuberance, called tro- chanter major ^[, stands out j the external** convex, part of which is distinguished into three different sur- faces, whereof the one on the fore-part +t is scabrotts * Proximal.

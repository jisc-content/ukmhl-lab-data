OF TtfE BONES IN GENERAL. 42 almost concealed by cellular membranes containing , the fat—and sometimes small simple mucousfolliculi may be seen (a.) • The different joints have these organs in different numbers and sizes; the conglomerate ones do not vary much, especially as to situation, in the similar joints of different bodies; but the others are more uncertain. 'Synovia. Upon pressing any of these glands with the finger, one can squeeze out of their excretories a mucilagin- . ous liquor, which somewhat resembles the white of an egg, or serum of the blood ; but it is manifestly salt to the taste. It does not coagulate by acids or by heat, as the serum, but by the latter turns first thinner, and, when evaporated, leaves only a thin salt film. The quantity of this mucilage, constantly supplied, must be very considerable, since we see what a plen- tiful troublesome discharge of glairy matter follows a wound or ulcer of any joint; of which liquor the mu- cilage is a considerable part. The vessels which supply liquors for making the secretion of this mucilage, and the veins which bring back the blood remaining after the secretion, are to be seen without any preparation ; and, after a toler- able injection of the arteries, the glands are covered with them. In a sound state, we are not conscious of any sen- sibility in those glands; but, in some cases which I have seen, when they inflame and suppurate, the most racking pain is felt in them : a melancholy, though a sure proof that they have nerves. These mucilaginous glands are commonly lodged in a cellular substance ; which is also to be observed in other parts of the bag formed by the ligaments of the articulation ; and contains a fatty matter, that must necessarily be attenuated, and forced through the including membranes into the cavity of the joint, by the pressure which it suffers from the moving bones.

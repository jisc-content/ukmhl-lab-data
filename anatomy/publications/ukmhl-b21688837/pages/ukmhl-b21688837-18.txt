Xll INTRODUCTORY VIEW OF comes anterior or posterior in quadrupeds, while an~ tenor or posterior in the former, is in the latter superi- or or inferior. The advantages of a Nomenclature, in which t he- same terms should universally apply to the same organ, in all positions of the hody, and in all animals, scarce- ly require to he pointed out ; and we think, that those advantages belong to the Nomenclature, lately pro- posed by Dr Barclay. The terms of this Nomenclature are derived from parts of the hody, which are found in most vertebral animals, and being fixed and determinate, can never: confound or mislead. Some of these terms are gener- al, applying indiscriminately to every part of the ani- mal body; but most of them refer to some particular: region or organ of the body. Of the general terms, the most universal, and per- haps the most useful, is that which respects an imagi- nary plane supposed to be drawn vertically through the* middle of the body, so as to divide it. into two equal and similar halves. This is called the mesial plane y, and that surface of a part ov organ which looks to- wards this plane is said to be mesial, or to have a me- sial aspect. Those which are situated in the opposite direction, or on either side of the plane, are lateral, being dextral or sinistral, according as they lie to the right or left of the mesial plane. Instead of external and internal, usually applied to denote the surface and the deep-seated parts of an organ, Dr Barclay employs peripheral and centralf;; the former denoting the aspect or position at or next the surface, the latter those next the centre of an or- gan or of the body in general.

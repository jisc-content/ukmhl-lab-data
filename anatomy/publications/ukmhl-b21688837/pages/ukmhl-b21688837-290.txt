248 OF THE NERVES IN GENERAL. Objections. 32. To this account of sensation, it is objected, first, That nerves are unfit for vibrations, because their ex- tremities, where objects are applied to them, are quite soft and pappy (ยง 21.), and therefore not susceptible of the vibrations supposed ; and if there could be any little tremor made here by the impulse of objects, it could not be continued along the nervous cord, be- cause the cellular substance by which each particular fibre is connected to the neighbouring ones (ยง 11.), and the fatty substance in which the nervous ccrd is immersed (ยง 15.), would soon stifle any such vibra- tory motion. A second objection to this doctrine is, That suppos- ing the nerves capable of vibrations by the impres- sions of objects, these vibrations would not answer the design. For if what we know of other vibrating strings, to wit, that their tone remains the same, un- less their texture, length, or tension is altered, and that different substances striking them do no more than make the sound higher or lower; if these pro- perties are to be applied to nerves, then it will follow, that the same nerve would constantly convey the same idea, with no other variety than of its being weaker and stronger, whatever different objects were applied to it; unless we supposed the nerve changed in its texture, length, or tension, each time a differ- ent object is applied; which, it is presumed, no body will undertake to prove does happen. . Nay, Sdly, If ever such a variety of vibrations could be made, our sensations would notwithstanding be confused and indistinct, because the tremulous ner- vous fibre being firmly connected and contiguous to several other fibres of the same cord, would necessa- rily shake them too, by which we should have the no- tion of the object as applied at all the different parts where the extremities of these fibres terminate. 33. In whatever way the favourers of the doctrine of solid nerves please to apply the elasticity of nerves to the contraction of muscles, their adversaries insist that nerves are too weak to resist such weights as the muscles sustain ; they would surely break, especially

OF THE SKELETON. 1 .>& otherwise unequal : For the lower internal part of it is depressed below the cartilaginous surface .of the upper part, .and is not covered with cartilage; into the upper . part of this particular depression, where it is deepest . and of a semilunar form, the ligament of the thigh- bone, commonly, though improperly, called the round one, is inserted.; while in its more superficial lower part the large mucilaginous gland of this joint is lodged. The largest share of this separate depression is formed in the os ischium. From what has been said of the condition of the three bones composing this acetabulum in new-born children, it must be evident, that a considerable part of this cavity is cartilaginous in them. The ossa innominate are joke'd at their back part Connexion^ to each side of the os sacrum by a sort of suture, with oi"lhe cssa a very thin intervening canilage, which serves as soim\°mi~ much glue to cement these bones together; and strong"" ligaments go from the circumference of this unequal surface, to connect them more firmly. The ossa inno- minate are connected together at their fore-part by the ligamentous cartilage interposed between the two ossa pubis. These bones can therefore have no motion in a natural state, except what is common to the trunk of the body, or to the os sacrum. But it has been dis- puted, whether or not they loosen so much from each other ana from the os sacrum, in child-birth, by the flow of mucus to 'the pelvis,'zm\ by the throws of the labour, as that the ossa pubis recede from each other, and thereby allow the passage between the bones to be enlarged. Several observations (a) shew that this, relaxation sometimes happens : But those who had frequently opportunities of dissecting the bodies of women w|,0 dled immediatp]y after b ■ . deUvered ,rf children, teach us to beware of regarding this as the common effect of child-birth j for they found such a (a) Bauhim_Theat. anat. lib. 1. cap. 49.-Spigcl.

OF THE NEUVES IN GENERAL. 253 out of order, by too great or too small a quantity of liquors; by too viscid or too thin fluids ; by liquors consisting of too mild and sluggish particles, or of too acrid pungent ones; by too great or too little motion given to the liquors; by the diameters of the pipes being too much straitened, or too much enlarged; and by a great many other varieties of circumstances which might be thought capable of disturbing the functions of the nerves, supposing them to be cylin- drical excretories of the gland, the brain. 4-2. The numerous vessels of the encephalon have Fluid se- broueht some of the gentlemen who assert the nerves creted by & o tnt-* en CO** to be solid, to acknowledge, that there is a liquor se- ph.llon uofc creted in the brain : But then they will not allow that poured out this liquor is sent out by the proper nervous fibrils ; into the but that it is poured into the cellular substance in '^"^ which the nerves lie, to keep them moist and supple,s and therefore fit for exerting their elasticity, vibra- tion, &c. by which, in their opinion, the effects com- monly ascribed to nerves are produced. 43. Besides the objections already mentioned (ยง 32, 33,) against the nerves acting as elastic strings, this opinion has some other difficulties which may be ob- jected to it: For instance, there is not one analogous- example in the whole body of liquors secreted in a large gland, to be poured into a cellular substance, as is here supposed ; the liquors in the cells of the tela cellularis of other parts are separated from the little arteries which are distributed to these cells. Further, it cannot be imagined, how a liquor se- creted in the cortex ofthe brain should make its way through the medulla, to come out into the cellular membranes on the surface of that medulla. Lastly, A very simple experiment, of injecting wa- ter by the artery of any member, and thereby filling the cellular substance of the nerves of that member, shews evidently, that the liquor of the cellular sub- stance of the nerves has the same fountain as the li- quor has in the tela cellularis any where else, that is, from the little arteries dispersed upon it.

My pupils have frequently assured me, that they could, with very small reflection, trace out the whole reasoning from which my conclusions were drawn ; I hope their successors will also think this an agreeable manner of being instructed. Those gentlemen who desired I would add the lec- tures which I pronounce in my colleges as a commen- tary upon the text, where the diseases are mentioned, will, I persuade mvself, excuse me for not complying with their desire, when they consider the design of this is to be a school-book, and how great the difference is between instructing youth in private, and pretending to inform the public. Art. xxiv. vol. v. of Medical Essays and Observations, published in this place, is one of these lectures which I gave as a commentary on the paragraph (p. 9.) concerning the different kinds of caries *. In this edition, I have corrected the mistakes and obscure passages which I discovered in the former, and in some places I have made the descriptions more full and exact, aiming all I could to shun unnecessary minuteness on the one hand, and a blameabie inaccu- racy on the other : Whether I have bit that just me- dium, is what you and the public must now judge. I am still of opiuion, that figures of the bones would at any rate have been unnecessary in a book that is intended to be illustrated and explained by the origi- nals themselves ; but would be much more so now, when my late ingenious friend Mr Cheselden, Dr Al- binus, and Mr Sue % have published such elegant ones. * This Commentary is published in the quarto edition of the Doctor's works, p. 285.

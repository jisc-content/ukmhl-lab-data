Somewhat more externally * than the condyles, Denres- ere is a small rising and semilunated hollow in each sjons a„d le, which make part of the holes, common to the RiJSes- npital and petrous bones.—Immediately behind is, on each side, a scabrous ridge is extended from ? m.ddle of the condyle, towards the root of the stoid process. Into this ridge the musculus lalera- t, common y ascribed to Fallopius, is inserted.— •out the middle of the external convex surface, a Arches ge arch runs-cross the bone; from the upper late- i) Diemerbroeck, Anat. lib. 9. cap. 6.

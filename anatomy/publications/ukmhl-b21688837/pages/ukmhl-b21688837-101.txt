59 OF THE SKELETON. cause the adhesion of a part of the artery to the bone hinders its contraction, and consequently styptics can have little effect; the sides of the furrow keep off compressing substances from the artery; and we would wish to shun cauteries or escharotics, because they make the bone carious ; and nerves thus hurt sometimes produce violent symptoms. But, to return to the superciliary foramina, we must remark, that often, instead of a hole, a notch only is to be- seen : Nay, in some skulls, scarcely a vestige even of this is left; in others, both hole and notch are observable, when the nerve and artery run separately. Frequent- ly a hole is found on one side, and a notch on the other; at other times we see two holes ; or there is a common hole without, and two distinct entries inter- nally. The reason of this variety of a hole, notch, de- pression, or smoothness in the superciliary ridge, is the different length and tension of the nerves and ves- sels ; the shorter they are, the more they are sunk into the bone as it grows.—Near the middle of the inside of each orbit, hard by, or in the transverse suture, there is a small hole for the passage of the nasal twig of the first branch of the fifth pair of nerves, and of a branch of the opthalmic artery. This hole is sometimes en- tirely formed in the osfrontis; in other skulls, the sides of it are composed of this last bone, and of the os planum. It is commonly known by the name of orbitarium internum, though anterius should be added, because of the next, which is commonly omitted.— This, which may be called orbitarium internum pos- terius, is such another as the former; only smaller, and about an inch deeper in the orbit: through it a small branch of the ocular artery passes to the nose. Besides these six, there is a great number of small holes observable on the outer surface of this bone, particularly in the two protuberances above the eye- brows. Most of these penetrate no further than the sinuses, or than the diploe, if the sinuses are wanting; though sometimes I have seen this bone so perforated by a vast number of these small holes, that, placed

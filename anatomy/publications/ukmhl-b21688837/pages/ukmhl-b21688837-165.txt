OF THE SKELETON. 123 he lary/hv and the 0.9 hyoidcs are puiied towards each llier by the action of the sterno-hypidei and hyothy- tidi i muscles ; and to its upper edge, the ligamen- lus membranes of the epiglottis, tongue, and thyroid milage, are fixed. The cornua * of the os hyoidcs are stretched hack- Horns, ai ds from each side of its body, where often a small trrow points out the former separation ; for in young ibjects, the body and cornua are not one continued ibstance, as they come afterwards to be in adults. hese cornua are nr< always straight, nor of equal ogth ; their two plain surfaces stand obliquely slop- g from above outwards and downwards.—Into the ternal, the cerato-glossus is inserted above, and the yro-hyoideus muscle below; and to the one behind, e ligamentous membrane of the tongue and larynx heres. Each of the cornua becomes gradually smal- as it-is extended from the base : but ends in a und tubercle, from which a moveable cartilage stands t, which is connected to the upper process of the rtilago ihyrodea, Where the body of the m hyoidcs jx^ns on each side 4vvendi. th its cornua, a small styliform process, called ap- ccs. ndixi, rises upwards and backwards, into which the isculi stylo-hyoidei alteri, and part of the hyo-glossi iscles are fixed. From each of the m a ligament is* netimes extended to the styloid processes of the tem- ral bones, to keep the 0.9 hyoidcs from being drawn ) much forwards or downwards. The part of this anient next to these processes sometimes forms into reral cartilages, which afterwards ossify in old people rysch {a) says that he has seen this ossification con- ued as far up as the styloid processes, which were Jrefore jomed to the os hyoidcs by anchylosis. iwStT °f 'I* °\ ,iS Cdlular' but co-Sob,l». red with a. hrm external plate, .which is of sufficient ces. ength to bear the actions of so many muscles as are erted into it. * Crura, latera inferiora.

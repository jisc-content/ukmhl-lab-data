7 OF THE BONES IN GENERAL. the marrow, also saves its membranes and vessels, in the lower parts of the bones, from being compress- ed by the weight of the marrow above. The depressions between the fibres of the exter- nal plates of bones appear like so many furrows on their surface, into each of which the periosteum en- ters ; by which the surface of contact, consequently the cohesion, between it and the bone, is consider- ably increased, and a greater number of vessels is, sent from it into the bone, than if it was a plain sur- face. Both on the ridges and furrows, numerous little pits or orifices of canals are to be seen, by which the vessels pass to and from the bones *. After a successful injection, the arteries can be Vessels, traced in their course from the pits to the plates and fibres ; and, in sawing, cutting, or rasping the bones of living creatures, these vessels discover themselves, by the small drops of blood which then ooze out from the most solid part of the bones. But the clearest demonstration of the intimate dis- tribution of these small arteries, is. to observe the effect of" such a tinging substance as can retain its colour, when swallowed, digested, and mixed with the blood of any living animal, and, at the same time, has particles small enough to be conveyed into the vessels of the bones ; such is rubia iincto* rum, madder root (a) : For we see the gradual ad- vances which this tincture makes from the perios- teum into the more internal parts of the bones, and how universally the distribution of the liquors is made, the whole bony substance being tinged.- The arteries are larger near each end than at the middle of the large bones that are much moved ; be- cause they not only serve the bony plates near the • On this part of the subject, see Scarpa De pemtiori ossium Btructura.

OF THE SKELETON. , 125 |unk of our bodies are performed ; from which use Ley have justly got their name. Each of these vertebrae is composed of its body and •ocesses. The body is the thick spongy fore-part, -which is Body, invex before *, concave backwards'!", horizontal and ain in most, of them above J aud below —Nome- OS small holes, especially on the fore and back part 'their surface, give passage to their vessels, and allow e ligaments to enter their substance.—The edges of e body of each vertebra are covered, especially at e fore-part, with a ring of bone firmer and more lid than the substance of the body any where else, itse rings seem to be joined to the vertebrae in the nn of epiphyses, but are alleged by some (a) to be e ligaments ossified. They are of great use in pre- nting the spongy bodies from being broken in the jtions of the trunk.1 Between the bodies of each two adjoining vertebrae, Intervevte- substance of a nature between ligament and car-bral sub- age is interposed ; which seems to consist of Ccn-Stance- ntrical curved fibres, when it is cut horizontally 5 t when it is divided perpendicularly, the fibres ap- ar oblique^ and decussating each other (o). The ter part of the intervertebral ligaments is the most id and hard ; and they gradually-become softer till 7 are almost in the form of a glairy liquor in the ltre ; and therefore these substances were not im- ' iperly called mucous ligaments by the ancients (c). e external fibrous part .of each is capable of heir, J satly extended j and of being compressed into a 7 small space, while the middle fluid part is incom- sssible, or nearly so ; and the parts of this ligament ween the circumference and centre approach in their >perties to either, in proportion to their more solid or re fluid texture.

OF THE SKELETON. 215 tuberant and rough on its outside, where a strong round ligament: and the musculus biceps are inserted ; and, below the back-part of its internal side, a tubercle may be remarked, that gives rise to the strong-tendinous part of the solaeus muscle. The body of this bone is a little crooked inwards Body, and backwards *, which figure is owing to the actions of the muscles but is still further increased by nurses, who often hold children carelessly by the legs. The sharpest angle of the fibula is forwards f, on each side of which the bone is considerably but unequally, de- pressed by the bellies of the several muscles that rise from, or act upon it ; and, in old people, these muscles make distinct sinuosities for themselves. The exter- nal surface of the fibula is depressed obliquely from above downwards and backwards, by the two peroncei. Its internal surface is unequally divided into two nar- row longitudinal planes, by an oblique ridge extended from the upper-part of the anterior angle, to join with the lower end of the internal angle. To this ridge *he ligament stretched between the two bones of the leg is connected. The anterior of the two planes is very narrow above, where the extensor longus cligito- nnn and extensor longus poUicis arise from it ; but is broader below, where it has the print of the nanus Vesalii%. The posterior plane is broad and "hollow, giving origin to the larger share of the tibialis posticus. The internal angle of this bone has a tendinous mem- brane fixed to it, from which fibres of the flexor cligi- torum longus take their rise. The posterior surface of the fibula is the plainest and smoothest, but is made flat above by the solceus, and is hollowed below by the fiexor poUic's longus. In the middle of this surface the canal for the medullary vessels may be-seen slant- ing downwards. * Tibiad and poplitead. E. f Rotulad. E. i Poroneus tertius. Alb. E. gf>7]

OF THE SKELETON. process with a small point standing out from it. This it is that is imagined to resemble a tooth,* and has given name to the vertebra.—The side of this process, on which the hollow of the anterior arch of the first vertebra plays, is convex, smooth, and covered with a cartilage ; and it is of the same form behind, for the- ligament, which is extended transversely from one rough protuberance of the first vertebra to the other, and is cartilaginous in the middle, to move on it.—A ligament likewise goes out in au oblique transverse direction, from each side of the processus dentatus, to be fixed at its other end to the first vertebra, and to the occipital bone ) and another ligament rises up from near the point of the process to the os occipitis. The superior oblique processes of this vertebra den- tata are large, circular, very nearly in an horizontaF position, and slightly convex, to be adapted to the inferior oblique processes of the first vertebra.—A moveable cartilage is said by some authors to be in- terposed between these oblique processes of the first and second vei^tebra ; but I could never find it.—The inferior oblique processes of this vertebra dentata an- swer exactly to the description given of those common to all the cervical vertebrae. The transverse processes of the vct^tcbra dentata are short, very little hollowed at their upper part,, and not forked at their ends j and the canals through which the cervical arteries pass, are reflected outwards about the middle substance of each process ; so that the course of these vessels may be directed towards the transverse processes of the first vertebra.—Had this curvature of the arteries been made in a part so move- able as the neck is, while they were not defended by a bone, and fixed to that bone, scarcely a motion could have been performed without the utmost hazard ©f compression, and a stop put to the course of the liquids, with all its train of bad consequences. Hence we observe this same mechanism several times made »se of, when there is any occasion for a sudden cur_~ # Conoides, pyrenoides, odontoides.

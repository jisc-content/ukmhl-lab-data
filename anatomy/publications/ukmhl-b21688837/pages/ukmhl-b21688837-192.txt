150 OP THE SKELETON. The substance of these bones is very spongy, and in children cartilaginous , there being only a part of the first bone ossified in a new-boin infant. Since there- fore the intestinum rectum of children is not so firmly supported as it is in adults, this may be one reason why they are more subject to a procidentia ani than eld people (a). From the description of this bone, we see how little t it resembles the vertebrae; since it seldom has pro*-- cesses, never lias any. cavity for the spinal marrow,. nor holes for the passage of nerves. Its connexion I hinders it from being moved to either side, and its> motion backwards and forwards is much confined: Yet, as its ligaments can be stretched by a consider- able force, it is a great advantage in the excretion of. the fences alvince, and much more in child bearing, that: this bone should remain moveable ; and the right ma- nagement of it, in delivering women, may be of greatt benefit to them (b).—The mobility of the os coccygiss diminishing as people advance in age, especially wheal its ligaments and cartilages have not been kept flex-- ible by being stretched, is probably one reason why thei women, who are old maids before they marry, have ge- nerally hard labour in child-bed. The os coccygis serves to sustain the intestinum rec- tum ; and, in order to perforin this office more eftccw tually, it is made to turn with a curve forwards ; by. which also the bone itself, as well as the muscles and. teguments, is preserved from any injury, when we sit; with our body reclined back. Pelvis. The second part of the trunk of the skeleton, the, Pelvis, is the cylindrical cavity at the lower part of J the abdomen, formed by the os sacrum, os coccygis,-. and ossa innominata ; which last therefore fall now iftt course to be examined.

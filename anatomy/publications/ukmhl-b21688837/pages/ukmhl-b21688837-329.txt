OF THE PARTICULAR NERVES. 287 wilt from the spinal marrow. There is no greater incongruity in point of method to say, that the nerve â€¢we are describing receives additions from others that have not been described, than it is to repeat .in the description of a great many nerves, "that each of them gives branches to form a nerve of which we are igno- rant 5 which is all the difference between describing the intercostal before or after the spinal nerves. The branch reflected from the sixth pair, joined possibly by some filaments of the opihabnic branch of the fifth, runs along with the internal carotid ar- tery, through the crooked canal formed for it in the temporal -bone, where the little nerve is very soft and pappy, and in several subjects divides and unites again, and is joined by one or more branches from the filth, particularly of its superior maxillary branch, before it comes out of the skull. May the compres- sion of this nerve by the carotid artery when stretched during- the -systole, contribute to the diastole of the Jiea'rt? - As soon as the nerve escapes out of this bony canal, it is connected a little way with the eighth and ninth; then separating from these, after seeming to receive additional nerves from them, it forms a large ganglion, into which branches from the tenth of the head, and from the first and second cervical, enter. From this ganglion the nerves come out again small to run down the neck along with the carotid artery, communicating by blanches with the cervical nerves, and giving nerves to the muscles that bend the head and neck. As the intercostal is about to enter the thorax, it forms another ganglion, from which nerves are sent to the traehea and to tire heart those de- signed for the heart joining with the branches of the eighth, and most of them passing between the two great arteries and the auricles, to the substance of that muscle. The intercostal after this consisting of two branches, one going behind, and the other running over th.e fore-part of the subclavian artery, forms a new ganglion where the two branches unite below that artery, and then descending along the sides of

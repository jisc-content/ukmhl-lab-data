205 OF THE SKELETON. The bones of the first phalanx * of the'fingers answer First or to the description of the second bone of the thumb : proximal only that the cavity in their base is not so oblong; not Indiana, is their motion on the metacarpal bones so much con- fined $ for they can be moved laterally or circularly, but have no rotation, or a very small degree of it, round their axis. Both the ends of tbe first, phalanx are in a cartila- ginous state at birth ; and the upper one is afterwards affixed in form of an epiphyse. The second bone t of the fingers has its base formed Second or into two lateral cavities, and a middle protuberance ; middle while the lower end has two lateral protuberances and Pbalanx- a middle cavity ; therefore it is joined at both ends in the same manner, which none of the bones of the thumb are. This bone is in the same condition with the former in children. The third bone % differs nothing from the descrip- Third or tion of the third bone of the thumb, excepting in the distal general distinguishing marks; and therefore the second l)lialans- and third phalanx of the fingers enjoy only flexion and extension. The upper end of this third phalanx, is a cartilage in a ripe child ; and is only.an epiphijse after, till the full growth of the body. All the difference of the phalanges of the several Difler- fingers consists in their magnitude. '"The bones of the tllccs- middle finger § being the longest and largest,—those of the fore-finger || come next to that in thickness, but not in length, for those of the ringfivger ** are a little longer. The little-finger tt has the smallest bones. * n^axavSi/Xw. Froximul phalanx. E. f KcvSi/Xa;. Middle phalanx. E. } Mrrccxo^uUi piZaivov%iec. Distal phalanx.

288' OF THE PARTICULAR NERVES. the vertebrae of the thorax, receives branches from each of the duisal nerves ; which branches appear- ing to cdtne out between the ribs, have given the name of intercostal to the whole nerve. Where the addition is made to it from the fifth dorsal nerve, a branch goes off obliquely forwards j which being joined by such branches from the sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth dorsal, an anterior trunk is formed, and passes between the fibres of the appendix ma- culosa of the diaphragm, to form, along With the other intercostal and the branches of the eighth pair, a large similunar ganglion, situated between the coeiiac and superior mesenteric arteries j the roots ot which are as it were involved in a sort ot nervous net- work of this ganglion, from which a great number ot v^rv small nervous threads run out to he extended on the surface of all the branches of those two arteries, so as to be easilv seen when any of the arteries are stretched, but not to be raked from them by dissec- tion ; and thus the liver, gall-bladder, duodenum^ pancreas, spleen, jejunum, ilium, and a large share ot the colon, have their nerves sent from this great solar tansMon or plexus. May the peristaltic motion of the intestines depend in some measure on the passage of the intercostal nerves through the diaphragm? S-veral fibres of this ganglion, running down upon the "aorta, meet with other nerves sent ^om the Pos- terior trunk of the intercostal, which continues i s course along the sides of the vertebra,! they supply the vlamhdae renales, kidneys, and testes m men, or ovaria in women J and then they form a network upon the inferior mesenteric artery where the ner es of the two sides meet, and , accompany the branches of this artery to the part of the colon that lies in the left skle of 7the belly, and to the rectum, as far down is to the lower part of the pelvis. The intercostal continuing down by the side of the vertebra, of the loins, is joined by nerves coming fiom between these vertebra*, and sends nerves to the organs of generation and others in the^, being even join-

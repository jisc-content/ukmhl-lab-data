OF THE BONES IN GENERAL. 31 c 4 3 Sunneurosis, or syndesmosis, when ligaments Syndes* *re 'the connecting bodies, as they are in all the moveable articulations. • . . „ 3, Syssarcosis, when muscles are stretched from Systems. one bone to another, as they must be where there are moveable joints. The second class of articulations, the synarthrosis, Syn-ar- which is said to be the general term by which the ™ nobis, immoveable conjunction of bones is expressed, is di- vided into three kinds. 1. The suture* is that articulation where two Suture. bones are mutually indented into each other, or as if they were sewed together, and is formed by the fibres of two bones meeting while they are yet flexi- ble and yielding, and have not come to their full ex- tent of growth ; so that they mutually force into the interstices of each other, till, meeting with such re- sistance as they are not able to overcome, they are stopped from sprouting out farther, or are reflected ; and therefore these indentations are very different both in figure and magnitude: Thus the bones of the head are joined ; thus epiphyses are joined to the bones, before their full connection and union with them. Under this title of suture, the harmonia of the an* tients may be comprehended; scarcely any unmoved bones being joined by plain surfaces (a). 2. Gomphosis f is the fixing one bone into an- Goniphosis. other, as a nail is fixed in a board : Thus the teeth are secured in their sockets. 3. Schindylesis or ploughing (6), when a thin la- ScMndy- mella of one bone is received into a long narrow fur- lesis- row of another : Thus the processus azygos of the sphenoid, and the nasal process of the ethmoid bone, are received by the vomer.

The ossification of bones depends principally on their vessels being so disposed, and of such diame- ters, as to separate a liquor, which may easily turn into a bony substance, when it is deprived of its thinner parts ; as seems plain from the observation of the callous matter separated after fractures and ulcers, where part of the bone is taken out : For m these cases, the vessels extending themselves and the liquors added to them, are gradually formed into granulated flesh: which fills up all the space from which the bone is taken, then hardens t.ll it be- comes as firm as any other part of the bone Th,« happens frequently, even when the ends of the dis- eased bone are at a considerable distance from each *hTh-e induration of bones is also greatly assisted bv their being exposed, mor* than any other parts, to the strong pressure of the great weights they sup- port, to the violent contraction of the muscles fixed \o them, and to the force of the parts they contain, which endeavour to make way Tor their own further m-owth. By all this pressing force, the solid fibies Snd vessels of bones are thrust closer; and such par- ticles of the fluids conveyed in these vessels, as are fit to be united to the fibres, are sooner and more firmly incorporated with them, while the remaining fluids are forcibly driven out by the veins, to be mix- ed with the mass of blood. In consequence of this, the vessels gradually diminish as the bones harden. From which again we can understand one reason, why the bones of young animals sooner reunite after a fracture than those of old, and why cattle that are • put too soon to hard labour, seldom are of such large (a) Memoires de l'acad. des sciences, 1^43. arL23_ lb) Hildan, de vuln. gravis.

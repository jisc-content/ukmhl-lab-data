Sprains here occasion, as in the wrist,, great pain and obstinate tumours, which too often cause carious bones* Metatarsus * is composed of five bones, which Meiatar- in their general characters, agree with the metacarpal sus. bones ; but may be distinguished from them by the following marks : 1. They are longer, thicker, and stronger. 2. Their anterior + round ends are not so broad, and are less in proportion to their bases J. 5. Their bodies are sharper above and flatter on the sides, with their inferior ridge inclined more to the outside. 4. The tubercles at the lower parts of the round head are larger. The first || or internal metatarsal bone is easily dis- tinguished from the rest by its thickness. The one next to it is the longest, and with its sharp edge al- most perpendicular. The others are shorter and more oblique, as their situation is more external. "Which * 3tÂ»Sd;, -riiin, planta, planum, Yestigium, solium, pectus, praecordium, pectusculum. + Distal. E. } Proximal.

593 are attached superiorly to the anterior and posterior edges of the foramen magnum, and inferiorly to the up- per edge of the atlas, before and behind its oblique processes. The occipital bone, though not in contact with, is yet connected to the axis by the two lateral or moderator apparatus ligamentosus colli. The lateral ligaments arise from each side of the odontoid process, ascend obliquely outwards, and are inserted mio the inner side of each condyle. apparatus ligamentosus (or the perpendicular li- gament of some anatomists) is aflat fasciculus of fibres, which descend from the longer part of the cuneiform process, behind the odontoid process, and is inserted into the superior part of the transverse ligament of the middle, and into the bodies of the second and third vertebrae on either side, on these it becomes continuous with the posterior common vertebral lio-a- raent. articulatiox between the atlas and axis. These two vertebrae are not only connected by syno- vial membranes and fibrous bands around these, and oy a ligament anteriorly and posteriorly as in all the other vertebra, but the odontoid process is also se- cured in the atlas by a transverse ligament and synovial membranes. â€¢' _ The transverse ligament describes the fourth of a arcle, it is thick and fibro-cartilaginous in the centre IS attached on each side to the inner edge of each oblique process of the atlas, and is connected in the centre by some of the fibres of the apparatus liga- mentosus, to the cuneiform process superiorly, and to the body of the axis inferiorly; there is also a synovial sac connected to the posterior surface of the odontoid process, and to the anterior surface IS iganient; another synovial membrane covers the opposed cartilaginous surfaces of the atlas and the processus dentatus: by means of these several liga- ments all rotatory motion between the occiput a"nd

4.58 femur is articulated superiorly with the ilium, inferiorly with the tibia and anteriorly with the patella; like all long bones it is composed of compact tissue in the cen- tre and cellular at the extremities, the compact has a fibrous appearance, the whole shaft is traversed by a distinct medullary canal, which is crossed by numerous bony laminae; the femur is developed by 5 points of os- sification, one for the shaft, one for the tibial end, one for the head, and one in each trochanter. The bones of the leg are the patella, tibia and fibula. The Patella or Rotula or knee cap is a small bone in front of the knee joint, of a triangular figure, the base above, the apex below, its anterior surface is convex and covered by skin, a buvsa and some tendinous fibres, it is marked by several longitudinal lines, and presents a very fibrous appearance; the posterior surface is covered wdth cartilage and divided by a prominent vertical line into two lateral portions, of these the ex- ternal is larger and deeper than the internal; beneath these is a small triangular depressed surface into which the ligament of this bone is inserted; the upper edge is round and cut off obliquely backw^ards and downwards,^ to it the extensor tendons are attached ; the patella is of a cellular structure covered by a compact lamina which is very dense, and traversed by longitudinal striae ; it^ is developed from a single point of ossification and remains for a long time cartilaginous j it is articulated w'ith the condyles of the femur, and connected to the tibia by a pow erful ligament; it protects the fore part of the knee, and serves as a medium of connexion betw^een the extensor tendon and the leg. The Tibia, next to the femur, is the longest bone in the skeleton, it occupies the anterior and inper part of the le^T, its upper extremity is thick and expanded from side to side, its circumference is somewhat circular or oval, convex on the front and sides, but slightly grooved behind; on either side is a protuberance, that on the in- ternal, is the more prominent for the insertion of the internal lateral ligament and the tendon of the semi- membranosus muscle ; a little behind the external tu- berosity is a small rounded surface looking downwards, covered with cartilage for articulation with the head o

185 Acceleratoh Urin^, or Ejaculator Sej^iinis, is in the middle of the perinasiim, extends from the front of the rectum to the back part of the scrotum, and is attached to its fellow along the mesial line; it arises first, by tendinous fibres from the triangular or inter-os- seous ligament, internal to the erector penis: secondly, by a broad tendon, which is common to the opposite muscle, and which lies above the urethra, between it and the pubis ; thirdly, more anteriorly by a tendinous expansion from the side of the corpus cavernosum pe- nis. Ihe posterior and middle fibres descend inwards ; the anterior fibres, which are longer, descend obliquely backwards and inwards j all the fibres are inserted along with those of the opposite muscle into the middle ten- dinous line or raphe of the perinaeum, which extends from the central point to the back of the scrotum. Use ; to expel the last drops of urine and semen, also to distend the corpus spongiosum uretlirae by propelling- the blood into its cells. The posterior origin of this muscle is overlapped by the erector penis, and by the perinaeal vessels and nerves; the origin of the middle fibres lies above the urethra, and that of the anterior is external to the crus penis. The anterior fibres of this pair of muscles, by converging towards the middle line, resemble the letter Y. The acceleratores urinse mus- cles fill up the middle of the peringeum, cover the bulb, and encircle the urethra anterior to it. Separate these muscles from each other along the mesial line, and de- tach one of theni from the corpus spongiosum urethrcE; then by examining its deep surface, its origin, parti- ticularly that which lies above the urethra, anterior to the bulb, will be more distinctly seen. Transversalis Perin^i, is thin and weak, often mdistmct, and sometimes wanting; it arises from the inside of the tuberosity of the ischium, the fibres pass transversely inwards and a little downwards, and are inserted into the central point of the perinaeum, behind tlie accelerator urinte muscle. Use, to fix the central point, and support the anus ; it may also dilate the bulb. Ibis muscle is covered by the sphincter ani, and by the superficial fascia, a small artery (transversalis perinmi) runs along its anterior edge; it lies on the levator ani

473 The Radius is shorter than the ulna by the length of the olecranon; it is situated at the outer and anterior part of the forearm, is larger below than above, is curved about the centre, and is convex outwards; it is divided into the body and two extremities; the upper or hu- meral end presents a head, neck, and tubercle ; the head is a circular superficial cavity, its surface and circum- ference covered with cartilage; the former to articu- late with the small head of the humerus, and the latter with the sigmoid cavity of the ulna, and with the annu- lar or coronary ligament; the internal or ulnar portion of the circumference is broader than the external; the ueck is about an inch long, it descends obliquely out- wards, it is contracted and circular ; at its lower extre- mity is the tuber-cle, this process is directed backwards and inwards, into its external rough surface the tendon of the biceps is inserted ; anteriorly it is smooth, and co- vered by a bursa. The body or shaft of the radius is somewhat triangular, and presents three surfaces, sepa- rated by three margins or angles ; the anterior surface is broad below and covered by the pronator quadratus, narrow above where it gives attachment to the flexor pollicis; about one-third from the head is the orifice of ihe^ vascular canal, slanting obliquely upwards ; the pos- terior surface is convex above and covered by the su- pinator brevis, concave in the middle for the extensors of the thumb, and convex below; the external surface is round and convex, and presents near the centre a rough surface for the insertion of the pronator teres ; of the angles or edges the inner is most distinct; it IS sharp, and gives attachment to the interosseous liga- ment. The lower or carpal end of the radius is square, its anterior prominent edge gives attachment to the ante- rior carpal ligament; posteriorly it presents three grooves tor the extensor tendons; one nearly in tlie middle line narrow and oblique, lodges the tendon of the extensor secundi internodii pollicis, the second is at the ulnar side of this, is broad, and transmits the tendons of the ex- tensor communis and indicator, and the third, which is to the radial side of the first, is divided into two for the ten- dons of the extensor carpi radialis, longus, and brevis - along the external border of this bone, is another groove s s 2

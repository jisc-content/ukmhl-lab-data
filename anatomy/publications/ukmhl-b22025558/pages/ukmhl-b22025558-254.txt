tibial vessels and nerves also pass beneath it. The in- ternal annular ligament is broader than the anterior ; it is attached to the internal malleolus, and to the os cal- cis ; it forms a sort of arch over the groove or canal in vrhich the three flexor tendons, and the plantar nerves and vessels run. The fascia of the leg is thin poste- riorly : near the heel it is indistinct ; on either side it is connected to the sheaths of the tendons that pass round the malleoli; and on each side of the tendo Achillis it sends in a lamina to join the fascia which covers the deep muscles of the leg. The fascia serves to confine the muscles in their situation, and to give origin to many of their fibres ; this last effect is further accorn- piished by inter-muscular bands or septa, which pass in from the fascia, between the extensor and peronaei mus- cles, and are attached to the tibia and fibula and inter- osseous ligament. From the anterior annular ligament, a thin fascia is extended over the dorsum of the foot; that covering the sole of the foot, the plantar foscia is remarkably strong ; it arises from the extremity of the os calcis, narrow but thick and strong ; it passes for- wards, expands and divides into three parts, which lie on different planes, and which, by sending in two pro- cesses, serve to separate the plantar muscles into thiee orders, the internal, middle, and external; the lateral portions of this fascia are attached to the sides of the tarsus and metatarsus; the internal portion is the weakest: the middle division is the strongest, and on a plane inferior to the internal; as this middle portion expands beneath the plantar muscles, it is strengthened by transverse fibres, and near the base of the toes it di- vides into five fasciculi, these diverge, and opposite the head of each metatarsal bone, they each sub-divide into two fasciculi; these pass along the sides of the me- tatarso-phalangal articulations, and are inserted into the lateral ligaments of these joints, and into the sheaths of the flexor tendons; between these fasci- culi the tendons pass, also the digital vessels and nerves of each toe : the plantar fascia possesses the same strength as ligamentous structure ; use, it serves to retain the arched form of the foot, and to protect the plantar muscles, vessels, and nerves, from pres-

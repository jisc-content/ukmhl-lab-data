102 distributed to the muscles of the forearm and hand ; 5th, the musailo-spiral, or radial nerve, descends be- tween the second and third heads of the triceps, and winds round the back part of the humerus, supplying the triceps in its course; it next runs spirally forwards to the forepart of the bone, between the supinator longus and brachialis anticus ; it then descends over the forepart of the elbow joint to the muscles of the forearm, where we shall trace it afterwards; 6th, the circumflex, or articular nerve, accompanied by tlie pos- terior circumflex artery, passes out of the axilla be- tween the long head of the triceps and the neck of the humerus, winds round the latter beneath the deltoid muscle, to which its branches are distributed.â€”See Anatomy of Nervous System. SECTION II. DISSECTION OF THE FOREARM AND HAND. Remove the integuments from the front and back of the forearm and hand, and the investing fascia will be exposed, together with the cutaneous nerves and veins; the latter may be noticed first. The basilic vein is seen to arise by small branches from the sides of the little finger, one of which is named salvatella ; it then ascends along the ulnar side of the forearm, receiving in this course small branches from the front and back of the arm, and passing anterior to the internal condyle, it is joined by the median basilic j it then ascends along the inner side of the arm, passes beneath the fascia, and joins one of the deep brachial veins; sometimes it con- tinues in a superficial course to the axilla, and joins the axillary vein. The cephalic vein commences by several small branches about the thumb and back of the hand; it ascends along the radial side of the forearm, passes over the bend of the elbow, is joined by the median cephalic, and then ascends along the outside of the arm to the clavicle. The median vein arises by small branches

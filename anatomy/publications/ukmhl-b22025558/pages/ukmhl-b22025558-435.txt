425 false pelvis, wliich is rather a portion of the abdomen; this line is more distinct posteriorly than anteriorly ; this abdominal or upper strait of the pelvis is somewhat elliptical the greatest diameter being transverse; it is measured by four lines or diameters ; 1st, the antero- posterior or sacro-pubic is smallest on account of the projection of the sacrum ; 2nd, the transverse or iliac which crosses the 1st at right angles and is the greatest; bd and 4?th, the oblique which lead from one ilio sacral articulation to the opposite ilio pubal eminence, or the cotyloid wall. Above this strait the great or false pelvis expands and is deficient in bone anteriorly, being only closed by the abdominal muscles. Beneath this strait is the true pelvis, which is a sort of curved canal longer tlian the false pelvis and wider about the centre than at either strait, with smooth walls, concave posteriorly from above downwards, concave anteriorly in the transverse direction, and on either side nearly plane ; the sacrum and coccyx bound it posteriorly, the pubes and thyroid foramina anteriorly, and on either side a portion of the ilium and ischium, the sciatic notches and ligaments. The pelvis is placed in an oblique direction, its upper orifice looking forwards, so that if a line be passed ho- rizontally from the upper border of the symphisis pubis backwards, it wiU meet the middle of the sacrum. The lower orifice looks ijackwards and downwards, the axis of the two orifices therefore is not the same, tliat of the superior if produced would pass anteriorly through the abdominal muscles, between the pubis and umbilicus, and posteriorly it would rest against the lower third of the sacrum; the axis of the lower strait if produced from below upwards would touch the promontory of the sa- crum, these lines therefore will decussate near the cen- tre of the pelvis and form an oblique angle forwards. The axis of the false pelvis is nearly vertical, while that of the true cavity is oblique from above and from before downwards and backwards. The female pelvis differs r.om the male in several circumstances, it is wider and larger, but not so deep, the alae of the ilium are more expanded, the prominence of the sacrum is less, the upper strait is rounder and wider, the sacrum is broad and more concave, the pubic arch more round and open o o 2

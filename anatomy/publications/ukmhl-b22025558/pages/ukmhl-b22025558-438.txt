428 On either side of the median line of the frontal bone and proceeding from above downwards we observe, 1st, a smooth surface, covered by the occipito-frontalis muscle; 2d, the frontal eminence, which is particularly prominent in the young ; beneath this a slight depres- sion bounded below by the superciliary arch towards the inner third of wliich is the supra-orbital hole, or notch, which is completed into a hole by a ligament, and which transmits the supraorbital nerve and vessels ; from this notch a small foramen leads obliquely into the diploe of the bone; immediately above the internal third of this arch is the prominence of the frontal sinus, and below it is the edge of the orbit, at each extremity of which are the angular processes \ the external is pro- minent and joins the malar bone, the internal is thin and broad and joins the unguis ; above and outside the external is the temporal ridge or process, which is pro- minent below and leads upwards and backwards to join a similar ridge on the parietal bone, this separates the forehead from the temple and gives attachment to the temporal muscle and fascia. On the cerebral or inter- nal surface of this portion of the frontal bone, we ob- serve in the median line a groove for the longitudinal sinus; interiorly the edges of this groove unite into a ridge to which the falx adheres, and which extends down to a small hole, the foramen caecum, which is be- tween this bone and the ethmoid; on either side of this median line are numerous irregularities, corresponding to the convolutions of the brain, in general, but not uniformly, for occasionally a prominent part of the bone is opposed to an eminence of the brain ; these are named the mammillary eminences, and the digital im- pressions, in some of the latter the bone is often very thin. The circumference of the os frontis is thick, rough, and serrated to join the parietal bones; the tables are cot unequally, the external above, the inter- nal below', so that it rests on each parietal above, and overlaps it below; below the temporal process it is bevelled oflâ€™ thin and rough, and is inserted under and between the laminaa of the ala of the sphenoid bone. The injerior portion of the frontal bone presents the deep osthmoidal notch in the centre, in front of which

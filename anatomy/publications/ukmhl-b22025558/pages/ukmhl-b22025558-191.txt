181 ilium, to Poupartâ€™s ligament, as far inwards as the iliac artery, behind which it passes and becomes continuous with the pubic portion of the fascia lata ; the fibres of this muscle all descend obliquely inwards, join the outer side of the tendon of the psoas magnus, and are inserted along with it, or rather into it; the inferior fibres are cilso inserted into the anterior and inner surface of the femur, below the lesser trochanter. Use ; to assist the psoas in flexing the thigh, and in rotating it outwards; It also abducts it; it protects the fore part of the cap- sular ligament, and inflexion of the thigh draws it out of the angle between the neck of the femur and the edge of the acetabulum. Ibis muscle fills up the concavity of the iliac fossa ; on the right side it is covered by the caecum, on the left by the colon ; in the groin this muscle is partly covered hy the sartorius, and it lies on the rectus and on the capsular ligament. VVe may next proceed to the dissection of the perinaeum and the viscera of the pelvis. , 'n \ "v.r ^ SECTION IV. DISSECTION OF THE PERINJ2UM IN THE Place the subject on the back, bend the thighs aiiu knees upon the trunk, and secure them in the same po- sition as if you were about to perform the lateral opera- tion of lithotomy; the dissection will be facilitated if the pelvis be raised by a block placed beneath it; mo- derately distend the lower end of the rectum with sponge or curled hair; introduce a staff or catheter into the urethra and bladder; 'secure the penis to it by a lio-a- ture, and raise up the scrotum. The perinceiim extends trom the os coccygis behind, to the arch of the pubis before; is bounded on each side by the rami of the pubis and ischium, by the tuber ischii, and by the great sacro-sciatic ligament, which extends from that process to the Bide of the sacrum and coccyx; the glutseus n

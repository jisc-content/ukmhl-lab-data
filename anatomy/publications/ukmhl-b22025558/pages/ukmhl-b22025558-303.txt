293 which, however, are so close, as to appear but one; each fasciculus receives a sheath from the dura mater, they then pass througli the inter-vertebral foramen, and and in this situation a small oval ganglion is formed upon the posterior root ot each, to the surface of this ganglion the anterior root is only connected; imme- diately on the outer side of this ganglion the two roots unite and form a single cord ; this is the proper spinal nerve; after a short course outwards, this divides into two branches, a posterior and an anterior; the former is almost universally the smaller, and is distributed to tJie muscles and integuments posterior to the vertebral column ; the anterior branches of the spinal nerves are much larger; they enter into several plexuses, and sup- ply the muscles anterior to the spinal column, as also the extremities. The superior cervical nerves take nearly a transverse course from their origin to the inter-verte- bral foramina; the succeeding nerves are more oblique, and the lumbar and sacral take a longitudinal couiâ€™se, and form their ganglions and subsequent divisions with- in the spinal canal. The course and distribution of the spinal nerves shall be examined individually afterw'ards the student may next dissect the brain from below. DISSECTION OF THE BRAIN FROM BELOW. The brain, medulla oblongata, and the upper part of the spinal cord should be carefully removed from the subject; the brain, with the base uppermost, should then be placed in a shallow basin ; the ca-ebellum and medulla oblongata will now fill a little backwards, and all the parts of the base of the brain will be exposed Kaise the pia mater from the fore-part and sides of the medulla oblongata ; the several eminences on this organ may be traced upwards to the cerebrum, or to the ce- rebellum ; to follow these, the dissector should rather scrape the surrounding substance with the handle or with the back of the knife, than cut it with the edo-e In the description of the brain already given, certain dilterences between the cineritious and the white sub, c c 2

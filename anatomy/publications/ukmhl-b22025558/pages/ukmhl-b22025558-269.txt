Use, to approximate the toes, and to contract the transverse arch of the foot: behind this muscle the strong calcaneo-cuboid ligament is observed, also the tendon of the tibialis posticus dividing into several slips, which are inserted into the adjacent bones and ligaments. hLExoR Brevis Minimi Digiti, arises tendinous and fleshy from the cuboid and fifth metatarsal bone, and from the sheath of the peronueus longus tendon / it passes forwards and outwards, and is inserted into the inner side of the base of the first phalanx of the little toe. Use, to flex and adduct this toe. This muscle is connected to the abductor minimi digiti; it fills up the concavity of the fifth metatarsal bone. Detach these four muscles in this layer from the tarsus, and the fourth layer will come into view, namely, the tendon of the peronseus longus and the interossei muscles ; the former crosses the foot obliquely forwards and inwards from a deep groove in the cuboid, beneath the cunei- form and metatarsal bones, to be uiserted into the in- ternal cuneiform, and into the base of the first and se- cond metatarsal bones; in this course this strong round tendon is enclosed in a tendinous sheath, which is lined by synovial membrane, and is attached to the several projections of the adjoining bones. Use, to serve as a strong transverse ligament in strengthening the tarsus and metatarsus in that direction ; this course and con- nexion of the tendon explains the action of the pero- naius longus muscle, namely, to extend the ankle oint to elevate the external side of the foot, to depress its internal side, and to turn the point of the foot out- wards. Interossei Muscles are seven in number; three are seen in the sole of the foot, and four on the dor- sum ; they fill up the interstices between the metatarsal bones: the three inferior are named interossei interni or inferiores; they arise tendinous and fleshy from between the metatarsal bones of the four external toes and are inserted tendinous into the inner side of the base of the-first phalanx of the three lesser toes to adduct the toes. ' â€™ i first of the inferior interossei is situated between

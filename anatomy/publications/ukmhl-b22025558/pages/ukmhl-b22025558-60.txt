.50 SECTION VI. DISSECTION OF THE DEEP MUSCLES OF THE NECK. These muscles lie close to the vertebrae, and are ex- posed by removing the plTarynx, laiynx, cervical vessels Euid nerves. Longus Colli extends from the third dorsal verte- bra to the atlas ; it arises from the bodies of three supe- rior dorsal and four inferior cervical vertebrae, from the iotervertebral ligaments, also from the head of the first rjb, and from the anterior tubercles of the iransverse processes of the four last cervical vertebrae ; the fibres ascend obliquely inwards, adhering to each bone m their course, and are inserted into the forepart of the 1st, 2cl and 3d cervical vertebrae. Use, to bend the neck to one side, and rotate the atlas on the dentatus; or, if both muscles act, to bend the neck directly forwards. Ihis muscle appears to consist of an inferior and superior portion; the first arising from the bodies of the dorsal is inserted into those of the inferior cervical vertebraE ; tlie second arising from the tiTinsverse processes ol the 3d,4th and 5th cervical vertebrae, is inserted into the bodies ot the 1st and 2d. These muscles, like most of those wmch adhere to the vertebrae, though long, yet consist ot short fibres which pass from one bone to another, are 'generally intermixed with tendinous substance, and are frregular as to the number of the vertebrae to which they are attached. , ^ Rectus Capitis Anticus Major, long and flat, arises by small tendons from the anterior tubercles ot the transverse processes of the four last cervical verte- br-e â€¢ they soon unite in a fieshy substance which ascends obliquely inwards, and is inseited broad into the cunei- forni process. Use, to bend forwards the neck and bead This muscle lies behind the carotid artery and sympathetic nerve, and between the longus colli and siakmi. Separate this muscle from its insertion, and we expose the following ; Rectus Capitis Anticus Minor, short and narro'v, ari es from the transverse process of the atlas, ascends

475 side is flat to meet the cuneiform, and its external to meet the scaphoid; its anterior surface is larger than its posterior, and it projects a little into the palmar arch. The cuneiform, or pyramidal bone. The base of this wedge-shaped bone looks outwards, and articulates with the lunar, the apex inwards ; it is convex and smooth above to meet the carpal fibro cartilage; concave and smooth below to articulate with the unciform bone ; rough posteriorly and internally for ligaments; anteri- orly it presents a flat circular cartilaginous surface for the pisiform bone. 'Y\\e pisiform bone. This small pea-shaped bone is the smallest in the carpus, at the upper and inner part of which it is placed ; it is also on a plane anterior to the first row ; it is articulated to the cuneiform bone by a small circular surface; its circumference is rough for the attachment of ligaments ; the flexor carpi ulnaris is inserted into it above, and the abductor minimi digiti below. The trapezium is the most external of the second row of the carpus; it is concave above to meet the scaphoid, below it is convex from behind forwards, and concave transversely, to support the metacarpal bone of the thumb ; anteriorly it is marked with a groove for the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis; internally it is articulated to the trapezoid, and beneath this by a small surface to the second metacarpal bone. The trapezoid is of a very irregular shape, and smaller than the trapezium; above it is smooth and concave to meet the scaphoid, externally it articulates with the trapezium, internally with the magnum, and inferiorly with the second metacarpal bone. The os magnum is the largest of the carpal bones ; it presents superiorly a round and hemispherical head, which is received into the socket formed by the scaphoid and lunar bones; this head is supported by a contracted neck, its greatest convexity is turned backwards and outwards; the inferior surface of the magnum is divided into three articulating surfaces; these support the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th metacarpal bones; that for the 3rd is the largest; its posterior surface is broad and convex below, and a little concave above ;

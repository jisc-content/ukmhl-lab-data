65 ber of abdominal viscera are supplied with nerves. In tlie dissection of the posterior mediastinum, the sympa- thetic nerve is also seen on each side; it does not lie in this space, but descends external to it, between the pleurae and the heads of the ribs; opposite each inter- costal space it forms a ganglion, from which some branches pass to join the dorsal spinal nerves, others to form the great splanchnic ; and at the lower part of the thorax two or three filaments often unite to form a small nerve, called lesse?- splanchnic, which enters the abdo- men behind or through the crura of the diaphragm, and joins the renal plexus of nerves. The sympathetic on each side enters the thorax close to the neck of the first rib, where it forms a large ganglion; it passes from this cavity by a very small filament, between the crus of the diaphragm and the psoas magnus, into the abdomen, where it again enlarges considerably.â€”See the Anatomy of the Nervous System. The division of the trachea, the last part of any importance connected with ^ the posterior mediastinum, does not, strictly speaking, lie in this space, but like the heart and great vessels, it is in the middle mediastinum, or between the anterior and posterior: this tube can be more conveniently exa- mined afterwards, when we are dissecting the parts w^hich pass through the upper opening of the thorax. Next examine the lungs. The lungs are situated at either side of the spine, and when distended with air, as they always are during life, they so exactly fill each side of the thorax that the pleura pulmonalis and costalis are always in such per- fect apposition, that there never can be any intermediate cavity; they are of a conical figure, the apex, above, rises into the neck a little above the level of the first rib, and in general higher on the right than on the left side; the base, below, concave, rests on the diaphragm : the external surface convex, and divided into two or three parts by a deep fissure ; the internal slightly concave, and attached near its centre by the root of the heart and great vessels ; the posterior edge of each lung is thick, round, and vertical ; the anterior is tiiin, irregular, ob- lique, and shorter tliari the posterior ; that of the left side 13 in general notched opposite the apex of the

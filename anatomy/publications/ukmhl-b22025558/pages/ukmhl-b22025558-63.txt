53 tered, or more separate than usual; in some it has a redder appearance than in others, and it frequently feels unusually hard or rugged, although free from disease. Pectoralis Major, flat and triangular, arises somewhat tendinous from the sternal half of the clavi- cle, from the anterior surface of the sternum, fleshy from the cartilages of the third, fourth, fifth and sixth true ribs, and from an aponeurosis common to it and the external oblique muscle; the clavicular fibres de- scend, the sternal pass horizontally, and the costal as- cend obliquely ; all pass outwards in front of the axil- la towards the humerus, into which they are inserted by a flat tendon into the anterior edge of the bicipital groove, and by an aponeurosis into ihe fascia of the arm ; a line of cellular membrane separates the clavicu- lar from the sternal portion ; in some cases these ap- pear as distinct muscles. Use, the clavicular portion can raise the arm and draw it forward, the sternal can press it to the side, particularly if assisted by the latis- simus dorsi, and the costal portion can draw it down- wards and forwards: the whole muscle will draw tlie arm forwards and inwards: if the arm have been ro- tated outvvards, it can roll it inwards; if the arms be fixed, and this pair of muscles act, they will draw the ribs upwards and outwards, and thus by enlarging the thorax assist in inspiration. This muscle is covered by the skin, platysma and mammary gland, and its in- sertion is partly concealed by the deltoid ; it covers a portion of the sternum and of the true ribs, also the subclavian and lesser pectoral muscles, the thoracic and axillary vessels and nerves. Between the clavicu- lar portion of this muscle and the anterior edge of the deltoid, is a space filled by cellular tissue, the cephalic vein and a small artery. The tendinous fibres of the sternal portions of opposite sides decussate each other, and cover the sternum with a sort of aponeurosis ; the insertion has a twisted appearance in front of the a.xilla, tlie sternal and costal portions being folded behind the clavicular, and inserted superior and posterior to it in- to the anterior edge of the bicipital groove, while the clavicular is united to the deltoid, and is inserted into the humerus along with that muscle; in some subieets f 2 â€¢'

160 connected to the transverse arch of the colon than it is to the small intestine, and is un-attached along two tri- angular spaces, one along the concave border between the laminae of the mesocolon, the other along the con- vex, between the layers of the great omentum ; this cir- cumstance favours the distension of the colon. The muscular coat of the large intestine also consists of longitudinal and circular fibres ; the former, however, are collected into three fasciculi, all of which commence at the vermiform process, and pass along the caecum and colon to the rectum: on this intestine the fibres separate, increase in thickness and number, and form a more perfect tunic ; near the anus these fibres are con- Ibunded with those of the levator ani muscle of each side. The internal or mucous coat of the lai-ge intes- tine is pale, and forms but few and.imperfect folds; in the rectum it becomes more vascular and villous, and presents several longitudinal folds, as also three or four very remarkable, in a horizontal direction. As the food is propelled along the intestinal canal, the chyle is ab- sorbed by the numerous lacteal vessels to which it be- comes exposed; it is also mixed with a quantity of fluid (succus intestinalis) secreted by the mucous glands, and by vessels of the mucous membrane; m the large intestine the food first presents the faeculent properties, and in its passage along this part of the canal, the ab- sorbent vessels continue to take up any chyle that may have escaped the preceding, as well as to absorb the watery parts of the food. The glandular viscera of the abdomen which are subservient to the process of digestion are the Liver, Spleen, and Pancreas. u i , The Liver is the largest secreting gland in the body; it fills the right hypochondrium, extends through the anterior parfof tlÂ« epigastric reg.on ,nto the elt hy- pochondlinm as far as the cardiac orifice of the s o- mach, beyond which, however, it frequently extends, even to the spleen; it is situated below the diaphragi^ and above the right kidney, the stomach diioi^enum and lesser omentum; it is supported in this situation by several folds of peritonaeum, termed ligaments ot the liver, viz. the falciform, round, right, left and coro-

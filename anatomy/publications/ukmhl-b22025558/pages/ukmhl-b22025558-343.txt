333 neck, but it enters the chest in a deeper situation than the nerve ot the right side; it descends between the left carotid and subclavian arteries, and arriving at the arch ot the aorta, divides into branches, some of which pass behind that vessel and join the cardiac ganglion; others unite with the cardiac nerves from the sympa- thetic, or from the vagus and recurrent. The middle cardiac nerve on the right side is generally the largest of the cardiac nerves; on the left side it is sometimes wanting, the inferior in such a case will be of a greater size ; it arises by several filaments from the middle cer- vical ganglion or from the sympathetic nerve about the middle of the neck ; it descends either a single cord, or divided into several parallel filaments behind and internal to the carotid, and enters the thorax anterior to the subclavian artery; it here is joined by large branches from the vagus and recurrent nerves, it then desceiids obliquely inwards along the side of the arteria innominata, glides between the arch of the aorta and the division of the trachea, and terminates in the cardiac ganglion or plexus. On the left side the middle car- diac nerve sometimes arises from the inferior cervical ganglion ; it enters the chest along the subclavian ar- tery, and either joins the inferior cardiac nerve or enters the cardiac plexus. The inferior cardiac nerve or nerves proceed from the inferior cervical ganglion, and on the right side descend along the arteria innominata to the arch of the aorta, round which they pass to its fore part, and terminate principally in the anterior cardiac plexus; some branches pass between the aorta and pul- monary artery to the cardiac ganglion ; these inferior cardiac nerves communicate with the precedino-, and with the vagus and its recurrent; they form an irregular network or plexus in their course to the aorta; on the left side these nerves accompany the subclavian artery and partly join the middle cardiac nerve, and partly the cardiac plexus. 1 he cardiac flexus or cardiac ganglion IS situated behind the ascending aorta near its orio-in and in front of the trachea and of the right pulmonary artery ; of a greyish colour and irregular form, it con- sists of a plexus of nerves formed by the cardiac nerves from opposite sides, also by branches of the eighth pair and the recurrent nerves; in the meshes of this plexus

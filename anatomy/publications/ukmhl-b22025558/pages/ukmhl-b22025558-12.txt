This muscle, like most of the superficial muscles of the face, is closely attached to the skin, which circum- stance, added to the paleness and smallness of their fibres, renders their dissection somewhat difficult and tedious. Most of the superficial muscles of the head and face, during life, assist some of the organs of sense, and contribute to produce certain changes in the coun- tenance, indicative of character or passion. The superficial muscles of the head are divided into those of the cranium and face. Those of the cranium are the occipito frontalis, and the three common mus- cles of the ear, Occipito-Frontalis is the only muscle which pro- perly belongs to the scalp ; it is thin and broad, fleshy at each extremity, aponeurotic in the centre. It arvics by tendinous and fleshy fibres on each side of the mid- dle line, from the two external thirds of the superior transverse ridge of the occipital bone, and from the ex- ternal and posterior part of the mastoid process ; the fibres on each side ascend, from behind forwards, and from without inwards, and soon terminate in one thin and broad tendon, which extends over the upper and lateral parts of the cranium,â€”This cranial aponeurosts having arrived opposite the coronal suture, ends in two fleshy portions, broader and thicker than the posterior extremities of this muscle; these anterior portions, which are thicker externally than internally, descend over the frontal bone, and are inserted, fleshy on each side, into the integument of the eyebrow, mixing with the fibres of the corrugator-supercilii and orbicularis palpe- brarum muscles ; a small fleshy slip is often continued down along the nasal bones, and is attached to the an- gular process of the os frontis, and inferiorly to the na- sal bones or cartilages : this slip is described by some as a distinct muscle, under the name of ppranridalis nasi, or fronto-nasalis. Use, Tlie occipito-frontalis muscle can raise the eyebrows and integument of the forehead into transverse wrinkles, draw the eyebrows a little outwards, and make tense the skin of the uppei eyelids ; also pull the scalp backwards ; but it the eye- brows be depressed and fixed, this muscle can then (particularly in some persons,) draw the scalp down-

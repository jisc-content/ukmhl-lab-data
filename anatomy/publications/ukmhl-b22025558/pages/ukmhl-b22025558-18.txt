8 tile of the face, behind the orbital portion of the levator labii superioris alaeque nasi; arises from the canine fossa below the infra-orbital foramen, and above the alveolus of the first molar tooth ; it descends obliquely forward, and is inserted narrow into the commissure of the lips, and into the orbicularis oris ; its name denotes its use. This muscle is covered by the orbicularis palpebrarum, levator labii superioris alaeque nasi, and by the zygoma- tic muscles, also by the infraorbital nerve and vessels, and by a quantity of soft adeps; it lies on the superior maxilla and on the mucous membrane of the mouth. Depressor labii superioris Al^que Nasi, a small flat muscle, exposed by everting the upper lip, and raising the mucous membrane on the side of the fraenum of the lip; it arises from the alveoli of the ca- nine and incisor teeth of the superior maxilla, ascends obliquely forwards, and is inserted into the integuments of the upper lip, and into the fibro-cartilage ot the sep- tum and ala nasi ; use, to press the lip against the an- terior teeth, and even to draw it under these, also to depress the septum and ala nasi. Depressor Anguli Oris, flat and triangular, arises broad and fleshy from the external oblique line on the outer side of the lower jaw, extending from the anterior edge of the masseter muscle to the mental foramen; the fibres ascend converging, and are inserted narrow, into the commissure of the lips; its name de- notes its use. This muscle is covered by the skin, some of its fibres are continuous with those ot the platisma myoides; it overlaps the buccinator and the following XTl US d G â€¢ Depressor Labii Inferioris, broad and somewhat square, arises from the side and front of the lower rnaxilla, just above its basis, and continues as far for- wards as the middle line; the fleshy fibres intermixed with fat, ascend a little inwards, decussating with some of the opposite muscle, and are inserted into halt of the lower lip, and into the orbicularis oris ; its name denotes its use. This muscle is covered by the skin, and partly by the depressor anguli oris : by separating these muscles the mental nerve and vessels are exposed;

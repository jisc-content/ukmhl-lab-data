123 fleshy into tlie outer edge of the two anterior thirds of the crest of the ilium. Use, to depress the ribs, and compress the abdominal viscera, so as to assist in expi- ration, and in the evacuation of the urine and faeces. When both muscles act, they can bend tlie trunk for- wards ; if one only act, it will bend it to that side, and it may also rotate it to the opposite side. This muscle is covered by the skin and superficial firscia, its posterior border is sometimes overlapped by the latissimus dorsi; in some cases, however, these muscles do not meet, and a small part of the internal oblique is seen in the trian- gular space between them. On the dissected tendons of this pair of muscles, we may remark the following- particulars : the linea alba and umbilicus, lineae semilu- nares, lineae transversae, the external abdominal or ingui- nal rings, and Poupartâ€™s ligament on each side. The Unea alba is a dense ligamentous cord, extending from the ensiform cartilage to the upper part of the symphysis pubis; it is formed by the intimate union, or by the crossing of the tendinous fibres of the muscles of oppo- site sides; its greatest breadth is at the umbilicus, from this to the pubis it decreases; its superior portion is much broader than its inferior: the integuments are more closely connected to this line, than they are at either side; hence the more fat the subject, the more indented will the skin appear along it. About the centre of the linea alba is the umbilicus ; this, in the foetus, was a foramen, through which were transmitted the umbilical vein from the mother, and the umbilical arteries and the urachus from the child : before the inte- guments were removed, this spot appeared depressed, particularly if the subject has been very fat; it now projects, and seems formed of very dense cellular tissue, surrounded by, and connected to the adjacent tendinous fibres. The linea alba serves as a fixed point for the oblique and transverse muscles on either side, also as a ligament to connect the thorax to the pelvis, and to support the former when bending the trunk backwards so as to resist or prevent too forcible extension of the spine. Jn the inferior part of this line some practitioners recommend the following operations to be peformed : puncturing

207 /ace, and the passage of the urethra above this, have caused this gland to be described as consistinjr of two ateral portions, called the right and left lateral lobes ; liese are connected to each other poste'riorly by a small transverse process, called the middle lobe; this may be seen by detaching the vesiculje seminales, and vasa de- terentia from the bladder, and leaving them suspended b> their common ducts, the middle lobe of the prostate wiJl then be seen to pass from one lateral lobe to the other, and to be closely connected to the mucous mem- brane of the bladder. The prostate gland has a firm resisting feel, is of a greyish colour, and appears to possess a very compact s rupture; this, however, is chiefly owing to the strong; ascia which invests it, and whicli forms its capsule ; the capsule has been already described as being partly derived from the posterior layer of the triangular liga- meiit, which expands on the sides and inferior surface oi the gland, and partly from the reflection of the pel- uT ^''®P“bes, called the anterior ligaments of the bladder. Next continue the incision which was made in the fore-part of the bladder, through the up- per part of the prostate, so as to lay open the urethra, we shall perceive how this gland surrounds the canal, also the greater thickness of its lateral portions. The prostate glands consist of several follicles or acini closely connected to each other, and covered externally by the capsule, and internally by the mucous mem- brane; these fohicles open by several small ducts, ten or twelve, on the lower surface of the urethra, on either side of the verumontanum ; some small ducts also open on the upper surface of the canal. ‘ by the common integuments, and by the superficial fascia ; the skin is thin and loose; -t is continued from that of the abdomen and scrotum around this orpn, and extends some way beyond it in the form of a loose fold, the prepuce; f4m Ihe extre- on y of this process the skin is riflectcd inwards as far as the corona glandis, where it becomes very thin • it of ‘be orifice of the urethra where it is continuous with the linin- membrane of the urethra; inferior to this opening ft

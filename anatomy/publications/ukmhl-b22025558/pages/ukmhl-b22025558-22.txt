12 larger than its caliber really is; it is formed of two coats, the external, white, fibrous and dense, commences beyond the anterior edge of the gland, and ends at the buccinator muscle, and the internal, a fine delicate mucous membrane, is continuous wdth that lining the mouth; the canal is larger at the commencement and at the buccinator than in the intervening space, or at the orifice in the mouth. Divide the parotid duct, and raise off the gland from the masseter muscle, and from the ramus of the jaw, observing at the same time its several deep-seated con- nexions. Next clean the masseter muscle and the temporal aponeurosis. Masseter is thick and strong, covers the ramus and angle of the jaw, and consists of two portions, one ante- rior, the other posterior; these decussate each other; the anterior arises chiefly tendinous from the superior maxilla, where it joins the malar bone; also from the inferior edge of the latter, the fibres pass downwards and backwards, and are inserted fleshy into the outer surface of the angle of the lower maxilla. The poste- rior or deep portion of the muscle arises chiefly fleshy, from the edge of the malar bone and from the zygoma- tic arch, as far back as the glenoid cavity; the fibres descend, some vertically, others obliquely forwards, and are inserted chiefly tendinous, into the external side of the angle and ramus of the jaw, as high as the coionoid process. Use, if both portions act together, they vvill elevate the lower jaw : if the anterior portion act alone, it will carry the jaw forwards and upwards ; and if the posterior act alone it will move it backwards and up- wards. Thus the masseter muscles of opposite sides, by the alternate action of their different portions, are powerful agents in mastication ; they not only cause the division of the food by the direct elevation and pressure of the lower maxilla against the upper, but they can also triturate it, by the great lateral moUon of the jaw which they are capable of exerting, i he masseter is covered by the skin, some fibres of the pla- tisma, a portion of the parotid gland, its excretory duct, and accompanying vessels and nerves, and by the zygo- matic muscles. It lies on the ramus of the jaw, and

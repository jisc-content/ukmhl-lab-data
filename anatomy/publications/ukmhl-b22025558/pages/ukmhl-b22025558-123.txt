113 nator longus and radial extensors of the carpus exter- nally ; by the anconaeus and extensor ulnaris posteriorly; and anteriorly by the radial nerve and vessels, and by the brachiaeus and biceps; it partly surrounds the hu- meral and ulnar articulations of the radius ; its anterior edge is notched above for the insertion of the biceps, and is overlapped by the pronator teres below. Extensor Ossts Metacarti Pollicxs, or Abduc- tor PoLLicis, arises fleshy from the middle of the pos- terior part of the ulna, below the anconaeus, also from the interosseous ligament and posterior surface of the ra- dius below the supinator brevis; it descends outwards and forwards, and ends in a tendon, which passes through a groove on the outside of the lower end of the radius, runs by the side of the carpus, and is inserted in general by two tendons, one into the os trapezium, and the other into the upper and back part of the metacarpal bone of the thumb. Use, to extend the first joint of the thumb, and separate it from the fingers ; it also extends the wrist, and abducts the hand ; it can also assist in supi- nation. The origin of this muscle is concealed b}' the extensor communis and carpi ulnaris; the tendon is su- perficial, and passes over the tendons of the common extensor, and of the radial extensors of the carpus, also over the radial vessels. Extensor Phimi Internodii Pollicis, or Exten- sor Minor, arises from the back part of the ulna, below Its middle, and from the interosseous ligament and iti- dius; it descends along the radial side of the last muscle ; its tendon jiasses through the same groove in the radius, and bound down by tlie same portion of the annular liga- ment, and is inserted into the posterior part of the first phalanx; a small slip is often continued on to the second phalanx. Use, to extend the second joint of the thumb, and to assist the last described muscle; its connexions are also similar. Extensor Sscundi Internodii Pollicis, or Ex- tensor Major, arises from the posterior surface of tlie ulna above its centre, and from the interosseous mem- brane ; its belly overlaps the two former muscles, its ten- don passes along a distinct groove in the radius, runs over the outer Side of the wrist, the metacarpal bone and

315 The Lin'gcal Nerve, or the ninth pair, on es- caping riom tlie condyloid foramen communicates with t e eighth pair, the sympathetic, and the nervous arch oi oop 0 the atlas ; it is at first posterior to the vessels and nerves in this situation, it then descends along their outer SI e, soon turns forwards, and becomes super- ficial to them ; It then takes the arched course of the digastric muscle across the neck, parallel but superficial to the Jinpal artery, and arriving at the side of the case ot the tongue above the os hyoides, it passes above _ the mylo-hyoid muscle and lies on the middle constrictor _ and on the hyo-glossus, at the anterior edge ot which it divides into several filaments, some of these p unge into the lingualis and genio-glossus mus- c es, others continue on to the point of the tongue, cornmunicating with each other and supplying the muscu ai substance of this organ. As the lingual nerve IS ent ingaci OSS the neck below the digastric tendon It sends offa considerable branch, the descendens colli, oi noni ; this nerve frequently receives a filament from the pneumo-gastric; it descends along the fore-part of the sheath of the carotid artery; about the middle of the neck it is joined by the internal descending branches le cervical plexus, with which it forms a small tri- angular plexus, the branches of which pass to the omo and sterno-hyoid and thyroid muscles; on the latter ^ome fi aments descend into the chest. Near the os hy- oides the lingua nerve sends some filaments to the nn! pharynx and stylo pharyngeus, also one to the thyro-hyoid muscle ; on the surface of the hyo-glpssus It gives off several branches to the sur- rounding muscles some also communicate with the gus- pah-; the lingual nerve then s chiefly in the genio-hyo-glossus muscle. SECTION II. DISSECTION OF THE SPINAL NERVES. There are eight cervical nerves, the first passes out above the atlas, and is named the sub-occ?pital, the

.129 fibres; the lower part of the muscle is superficial and very pale ; in cases of old hernia, the fibres of the cre- master are found greatly increased in thickness, and in that form of the disease called the oblique, or common inguinal hernia; this muscle always forms one of the coverings of the sac. The cremaster is absent in the female. Raise off the internal oblique from the trans- versalis muscle; commence above the anterior part of the crest of the ilium, where the muscles are separated by cellular membrane, and some branches of the cir- cumflex-ilii vessels, make one incision from the ilium towards the cartilage of the 9th rib, and another from the ilium, towards the lower third of the linea semilunaris; carefully dissect ofi’ the posterior part of the muscle, towards the spine, and the anterior towards the rectus; this portion can be separated from the transversalis, a little beyond the linea semilunaris. Transversalis, somewhat square, broader ante- riorly than posteriorly, arises tendinous from the fascia lumborum and the posterior part of the crest of the ilium, fleshy from the remaining anterior part of the crest, and from the iliac third of Poupart’s ligament; it also arises tendinous from the two last ribs, and by fleshy slips from the inner side of the five suc- ceeding ; these indigitate with the origins of the diaphragm; all the fibres pass transversely forwards, except the most inferior, which are curved a little downwards; they all end in a flat tendon, which, near the linea semilunaris, joins the posterior lamina of the internal oblique, and is inserted along with it into the whole length of the linea alba, into the upper edge of the pubis, and into the linea innominata; this tendon passes behind the rectus superiorly ; but infe- riorly, that is, about midway between the umbilicus and the pubis the conjoined tendons pass anterior to this muscle, and are inserted in the manner before mentioned. The transversalis abdominis is covered by the internal and external oblique; it lies on the fascia transversalis and the peritonaeum. Use, to compress the abdominal vis- cera, and assi.st in expiration : this muscle is tendinous before and behind, fleshy in the middle, also above and below, contrary to the two oblique muscles; the poste-

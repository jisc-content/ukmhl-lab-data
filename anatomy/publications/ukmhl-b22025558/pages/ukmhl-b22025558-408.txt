398 united poiteriorly and externally, anteriorly they are distinct. LIGAMENTS OF THE SCAPULA. These are two, in number, an anterior and posterior. The anterior or the deltoid, or coraco-ucroniial, arises broad from the coracoid process, passes upwaids ^nd outwards, and is inserted narrow into the point of the acromion process. The posterior or coracoid liga-' inent arises from the costa ot the scapula behind the notch, passes forwards, and is inserted into the base of the coracoid process; it converts the notch into a foramen : this ligament is sometimes wanting, then the notch is completed into a hole by bone : the supra-sca- pular nerve usually passes below this ligament, while the vessels of this name run above it. HUMERO-SCAPULAR ARTICULATION. The head of the humerus is retained in the glenoid cavity by the capsular and coraco-huraeral ligarnent^ and by a synovial membrane; the glenoid cavity is deepened by a fibrous border, which is partly derived from the tendon of the biceps. The capsular ligament arises around the neck ot the scapula, increases in size, encircles the head o' the humerus, and is inserted into its neck; it is dense above and below, thin internally and externally; this capsule is very loose and long, the tendons of the capsular muscles are identified with it. The coraco-lnmeral ligament extends from the cora-. coid nrocess to the anterior part of the gieat lube rosih'^ where it becomes confounded with the capsule and with the tendon of the supra-spinatus. vial membrane is reflected over ^ around the glenoid ligament, lines the capsule, and covers the head of tlie humerus, and also lines the bicipital groove.

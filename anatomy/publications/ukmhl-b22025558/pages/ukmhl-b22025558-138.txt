128 front of the rectus, along with the tendon of the trans- versalis, to which it is closely connected ; a little above the pubis these two tendons are inseparably joined, and are called the conjoined tendons. The internal oblique is tendinous and fleshy into the cartilages of the seven inferior ribs, tendinous into the ensiform cartilage, and into the whole length of the linea alba ; the con- joined tendons are inserted into the symphisis and upper edge of the pubis, and passing external to the rectus are also inserted into the lineskinnominata, where they are connected with Gimbernaut’s ligament, and inseparably joined to the fascia transversalis; these conjoined ten- dons lie posterior to the spermatic cord and to the tri- angular ligament, and afford much security to that part of the abdomen behind the external abdominal ring. Use of the internal oblique muscle, to assist the external ob- lique in expiration, arid in compressing the abdominal viscera, also in bending the trunk forwards, or to one side; it can also rotate the trunk, but in doing so, it co- operates with the external oblique of the opposite side: this muscle is covered by the latissimus dorsi; it lies on the transversalis muscle ; some small vessels ramify be- tween them ; a small portion of the internal oblique is sometimes superficial, between the external oblique and latissimus dorsi, and above the posterior part of the ilium. Along the inferior border of this muscle we observe the following: Chemaster, consists of a fasciculus of pale fleshy fibres, which arise from the internal surface of the external third of Poupart’s ligament, and from the lower edge of the last described muscle; a few fibres also sometimes proceed from the lower edge of the trans. versalis muscle; it frequently too has a tendinous attach- ment to the pubis, behind the external abdominal ring ; the fibres all pass downwards and forwa'rds around the spermatic cord, but chiefly along its outer side, and are inserted into the tunica vaginalis; a few fibres are lost in the scrotum. Use, to support, compress, and raise the testicle and the vessels; the origin of this muscle is covered by the tendon of the external oblique, and lies on the fascia transversalis; a small but long nerve, a branch from one of the lumbar nerves, runs between its

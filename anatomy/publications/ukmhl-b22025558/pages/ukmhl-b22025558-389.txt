379 thigh it gives several branches to the genielli, qua- dratus, glutceus maxirnus, and the hamstrings, and in- osculates with the external circumflex and sciatic arte- ries ; the Jirst or superior perforating artery passes backwards beneath the lesser trochanter, between the pectinaeus and adductor brevis, and through the adduc- tor magnus, its branches are distributed to the latter and to the hamstrings; the second ov middle peforating artery, larger than the first, passes through the adduc- tor brevis and magnus, and spreads its branches among the muscles on the back of the thigh ; the third or in- ferior perforating artery descends behind the adductor longus, and through the magnus to the hamstrings ; on the back part of the thigh the profunda ends in two branches, one passes to the biceps, the other to the semi-membranosus. After the origin of the profunda, the femoral gives off several small muscular and cutaneous twigs, and near the opening in the triceps, through which it passes, it gives ofl', 3rd, the anastomotica magna ; this descends in front of the adductor tendon to the knee, sends se- veral branches to the integuments, vastus internus, and to the patella; these inosculate with the long branches of the external circumflex artery above, and with the articular arteries below. The artery descends from the inner side of the femur, obliquely outwards to the inferior and central part of the popliteal space; it is covered by the skin and fascia, and overlapped superiorly by the semi- membranosus, and inferiorly by the gastrocnemius and plantaris muscles; the popliteal vein lies superficial and external to it; the sciatic nerve is still more super- ficial and external; its branches are, 1st, several mus- cular branches to the hamstrings and to the gastrocne- mius ; 2nd, superior articular, encircle the lower extre- mity of the femur, turn round the sides, to the fore-part of the joint, and communicate with the anastomotica and with branches of the external circumflex ; 3rd, azy- gos-articular, passes forwards through the posterior li^a- inent of the joint, and supplies the synovial membrane and the adipose substance in its cavity; 4'th, inferior articular arteries, encircle the lower part of the joint;

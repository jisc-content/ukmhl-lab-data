Use to extend the knee and turn the leg a little inwards The vastus inlernus is partly concealed by the rectus and sartorius, its origin lies anterior to the insertion of the psoas, pectinsus, and adductor muscles, and overlaos the crur^us, so as to be in contact with the vastus ex ternus; its internal surface is tendinous above and tieshy be ow; an aponeurosis from the two vasti covers the patella and its ligament, also the sides of the joint • this aponeurosis is inserted into the head of the tibia ir serves to support the patella in its situation, and to pm lect the sides of the articulation like a capsular li./a ment; a small bursa is situated over the patella be' tween this aponeurosis and the skin; the fnsertion of the vasms externus into the patella overlaps that of th^ v^tus internus, and both overlap the crurmus from which the vastus externus can be more easily separated above, but the vastus internus below, between which it lies, larger and more tendinous below than of‘’S anterior and external part h toe femur, commencing at the inter-trochanteric ne, and extending along three-fourths of the bone ns ar outwards as the linea aspera ; it does not adhere to the inner side of the femur, there being a portion of die latter, nearly an inch in breadth and Ltendini almost the whole length of tjie bone, to which no must

67 there are the following twelve small muscles, which, however, mav be seen more fully when the muscles of the back have been dissected. Levator Es Cost arum, arise narrow and tendinous from the extremity of each dorsal transverse process, descend obliquely outwards, and are inserted broad into the upper edge of the rib beneath, between its tubercle and angle; their name denotes their use. They are parallel to, and frequently appear as a portion of tlie external intercostals; the first levator is short, and arises from the last cervical vertebra; the inferior en» crease in length and size. Behind the sternum is a small muscle which cannot be seen until this bone is removed; tlie dissection of it, tlierefore, the student may postpone, until he is opening the cavity of the thorax. Triangularis Sterni, arises from the posterior surface and edge of the lower part of the sterjum, and from the xiphoid cartilage; the fibres ascend' ob- liquely outwards, the inferior pass transversely— serted into the cartilages of the 4th, 5ih and 6th ribs. Use, to depress and draw backwards the cartilages of the ribs, so as to assist in expiration. These muscles lie on the pleurae, pericardium, and diaphragm, are co- vered by the sternum, cartilages of the ribs, and mam- mary vessels. They antagonize the external intercos- tals, to whose fibres they are parallel, and this explains the cause of the external intercostals terminating at the ends of the ribs, and not continuing as far forwards as the sternum. 'I'he mechanism of respiration shall be further considered when the diaphragm has been ex- amined (see dissection of it.) In connexion with the muscles of the thorax, the student should study the anatomy of the axilla.

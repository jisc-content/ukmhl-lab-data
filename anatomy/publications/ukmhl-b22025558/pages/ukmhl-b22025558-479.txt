469 teres major, and to a few fibres of the latissimus dorsi muscle ; to the upper part of it the long head of the triceps is attached ; at the convergence of this and the superior costa, the glenoid cavity and the neck of the scapula are situated. The neck is that contracted por- tion, which gives attachment to the capsular liga- ment, it is most distinct externally and inferiorly: The glenoid cavity is superficial, oval, broader below, covered with cartilage, and in the recent subject deep- ened by the fibrous glenoid ligament, which is chiefly derived from the long tendon of the biceps, which is attached to the upper extremity of the cavity ; it is in- clined a little downwards, outwards, and forwards ; its aspect however varies, as the scapula is made to turn in all the rotatory motions of the arm. The scapula is composed of two compact laminas, and an intervenino- cellular tissue, the latter prevails in the processes, the neck and the inferior angle : in the middle of the fossje there is but little of it, and the compact substance is there thin and transparent. The scapula is developed by several points of ossification, one in the centre of the body, one for each of the processes, one for the inferior angle, and one for the posterior or vertebral edge. The 0^ Humeri is attached to the scapula above and to the radius and ulna below; it is the longest and largest bone in the upper extremity, it presents two extremuies and a body or shaft; the upper or scapular extremity is the larger, and consists of the head, neck, and 2 tuber- cles. The head is semis-pherical, inclined upwards, inwards, and backwards, smooth and covered with car- tilage for articulating with the glenoid cavity of the scapula ; the neck is the slightly contracted line around the head; it is rough for the attachment of the capsu- lar ligament, and a little longer below and before than above or behind ; the axis of the neck and head forms an obtuse angle with that of the shaft; the tuberosities are two, the greater and lesser; the great ox external is also posterior, it is round, and presents three depres- sions ; to the anterior of these the supra-spinous muscle is attached, to the middle the infra-spinous, and to the posterior the teres minor; the lesser tuberosity h aho anterior; it is more prominent, and gives insertion to s s

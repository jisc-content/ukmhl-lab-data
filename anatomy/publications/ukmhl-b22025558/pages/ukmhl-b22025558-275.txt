265 some of these accompany the vessels and nerves, and are gradually lost on them, others become continuous with the periosteum ; the most remarkable of these processes, next to that which is continued along the spinal canal, is one which passes through the foramen lacerum orbitale, and joins the periosteum in the orbit, and another which surrounds the optic nerve, and is united to the sclerotic coat of the eye. Several small arteries ramify on this membrane, between it and the bones ot the cranium, anteriorly these are derived from the ophthalmic and internal carotid vessels ; the middle artery of the dura mater is the largest, this is a branch of the internal maxillaiy, it enters the base of the cra- nium, through the spinous hole in the sphenoid bone, passes forwards and upwards above the temporal and sphenoid bones, then ascends obliquely backwards on the inner surface of the parietal bone, the anterior and inferior angle of which it grooves very deeply ; poste- riorly the dura mater receives several small arteries, viz. branches from the occipital, pharnygeal, and verte- bral arteries ; these vessels of the dura mater also sup- ply the superincumbent bones with blood. Cut through this rnembrane parallel to the edge of the cranium, raise it from each side of the brain towards the vertexâ€™ leaving a small portion of it in the mesial line, both be- fore and behind undivided ; the internal surface is now seen to be smooth and polished, and moistened with a fine serous exhalation : this surface is the reflected or the parietal layer of the arachnoid membrane (to be examined presently,) it adheres so closely to the dura mater that it is difficult so separate them for any ex- tent, unless previously macerated. From the internal surface of the dura mater, folds or processes extend into the cranium, which divide this cavity into several compartments, and support and se- parate different portions of the brain ; these processes are the falx cerebri, tentorium cerebelli and falx cere- belh The falx cerebri is exposed by gently separating one hemisphere of the brain from the other; it com- mences narrow at the crista galli and middle ridge of the ethmoid bone, thence it ascends in the median line and passing backwards, ends by being continued into A A

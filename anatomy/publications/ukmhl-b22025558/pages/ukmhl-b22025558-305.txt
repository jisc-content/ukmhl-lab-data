295 broad lamina which is thin in the centre, (the valve of Vieussens,) and thick at each side (processus a cerebel- lo ad testes;) thus the superior converging fibres con- nect the cerebellum to the quadrigeminal bodies. The inferior converging fibres are more distinct, they pro- ceed from the cineritious'substance in either hemisphere, forwards and inwards, and form the principal portion of each crus cerebelli; they then pass transversely across the pons Varolii.and unite with those from the opposite side; thus the superficial lamina or the transverse fibres ot the pons form a commissure between the hemispheres of the cerebellum. STRUCTURE OF THE CEREBRUM. Eemove the pia mater from the anterior pyramids of the medulla oblongata and separate these from each other, the decussating fibres will be seen, through these the pyramid on one side may be said to arise from the spinal cord of the opposite side; as the pyramids ap- proach the pons they are somewhat contracted; on entering this substance they separate into fasciculi, which intermix with cineritious substance; they are considerably increased in size and number in passino^ through the pons, and they then form the anterior and external two-thirds of the crura cerebri. The olivary body and a few fibres from the restiform of each side also ascend through the pons behind the fasciculi of the p3â€™ramids; these also increase in size in passing- through the pons, and then enter the crura cerebr^ posterior and internal part of which they form! Each crus cerebri contains a mass of cineritious sub- stance of a peculiarly dark colour, in passing through which the white fibres appear increased in quantity. Ihe posterior and internal fasciculi of each crus as- cend and pass into those masses of grey substance called the optic thalami, and the corpora striata, in passing through these their fibres are increased in num- ber, and thence extend in a radiated manner into the posterior and superior convolutions of each hemisphere where they are covered by a layer of grey substance!

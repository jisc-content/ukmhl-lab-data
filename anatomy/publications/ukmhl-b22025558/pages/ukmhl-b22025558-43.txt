33 it gives blanches to the submaxillary and sublingual glands, and terminates in fine filaments, which are lost in the papillae beneath the mucous membrane, covering the sides and tip of the tongue. The chorda tympani joins it near the condyle and parts from it opposite the amde of the lower maxilla; this delicate nerve then swells into a small ganglion, whose branches pass into the submaxillary gland. The eighth imir of nerves leave the cranium by the foramen lacerum posterius, anterior to the jugular vein ; it immediately separates into its three portions, the internal or glosso-pharyngeal, the external or spinal accessory, and the middle or par vagum. The glosso-pharyngeal is connected to the st3â€™io-pharyngeus muscle, its name denotes its destina-^ tion; the arch which it forms, as it runs to the base of the tongue, is inferior to and deeper in the neck than the gustatory nerve. The spinal accessory nerve sepa- rates from the par vagum, and in general winds round behind the internal jugular vein, perforates the sterno- mastoid muscle, as was before mentioned, and distri- butes its branches to it and to the trapezius; several of these also communicate with the cervical plexus, and descend to the acromion. The par vagum, or pneumo- gastric descends along the neck, between, and rather behind the carotid artery and jugular vein, and enclosed in their sheath ; it then passes through the thorax, and terminates on the stomach. The cervical portion only of this nerve is to be observed at present ; from it arise several branches, viz. communicating branches to join the sympathetic and lingual; pharyngeal branches to the side of the pharynx ; superior laryngeal nerve, which takes an arched course behind the great vessels to the thyroid cartilage, and is distributed to the upper part of the larynx; and small cardiac branches, which join similarly named branches of the sympathetic nerve. At the inferior part of the neck, on each side of the trachea, a large nerve, the inferior laryngeal or recur- rent nerve, in seen ; this is also a brancli of the par vagum. On the right side, this nerve arises at the lower part of the neck, turns round the subclavian ar- tery, and passing behind it and the carotid, pursues its course upwards and inwards behind the thyroid gland,

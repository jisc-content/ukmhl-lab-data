178 laughing, speaking; also in the expulsion of urine and faeces, and in the various exertions of the body. The student may now re-consider the different muscles which assist, and which oppose the diaphragm in respi- ration ; by this term we mean the act of taking into the lungs a certain quantity of air, and the subsequent expulsion of it from these organs ; the former is termed inspiration, the latter expiration. Inspiration requires greater muscular efforts than expiration, which is chiefly effected by the relaxation of the muscles of inspiration, and by the elasticity of the parietes of the thorax. Inspiration may be performed with two different de- grees of force; the first, in which there is little muscular effort, is called ordinary inspiration ; the second, in which there is great exertion, is called full inspiration. In the first, the dicohragm and the intercostal muscles are employed, but chief the former; and in the second, several additional muscles assist, viz. the scaleni, the subclavian, the serrati postici; also bj' fixing the su- perior extremities, the pectoral,serrati raagni and latis- simi dorsi muscles exert considerable power, in ele- vating the ribs and drawing them outwards, so as to enlarge the chest transversely, and from before back- wards. Expiration also may be performed in the same differ- ent degrees of intensity ; in the first or ordinary degree, the elasticity and slight contraction of the abdominal muscles press the viscera against the diaphragm, which is already receding in consequence of its own relaxation, and the elasticity of the parts attached to its thoracic surface : when expiration is performed in the second, or forced degree, the elasticity of the ribs and of their cartilages opposes the intercostal muscles; the tiian- gulares sterni also depress the cartilages, and the ab- dominal muscles and levatores ani, by increasing their contracting force, push the abdominal viscera against the diaphragm, and draw down the ribs; theseiiati postici inferiores and quadrati lumborum muscles assist, also the latissimi dorsi muscles, by acting towards the ilium ; and should the last rib be fixed, it is possible for the intercostal muscles to depress the superior iibs, Â«n so to become muscles of expiration.

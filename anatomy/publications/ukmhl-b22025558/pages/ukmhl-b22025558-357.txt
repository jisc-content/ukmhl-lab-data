347 tlie surface of the eye ; along this canal tlie tears are supposed by some to be directed inwards towards the puncta, others however deny that any such space can exist, and affirm that the lachrymal secretion flows along each palpebral sinus, and is directed inwards by the action of the orbicular muscle; the skin of each palpebra IS thin, the sub-cutaneous cellular tissue very loose and reticular; beneath this the orbicular muscle is expanded.—(See page 4.) The tarsal cartilages are thin elastic plates ; the superior is semilunar and lan>-er than the inferior, which is long and narrow ; the ciliary tnargins are thick; their orbital edges thin and con- nected to the orbit by the palpebral ligaments which are a continuation of the periosteum ; tlicse ligaments aie stionger towards the temple, where they discussate and attach the cartilages at their external canthus or commissure; the tendo oculi fixes them internally. Between each tarsal cartilage and the conjunctiva are the Meibomian glands ov follicles ; they are of a white or yellow colour, are arranged in nearly parallel verti- cal rows, and are more numerous in the upper eye-lid • t^.iey secrete a thin sebaceous fluid, which is discharged behind the ciliae, 1 he cihce arise from bulbs which are beneath the skin ; those of the upper eye-lid are 1 e numerous than those in the lower; boUi are curved convex towards each other. ’ Puncta Lac/irt/malia are two small holes always K- backwards and outwards, opposite e-Jeh othei ; they meet when the lids are cloLd; each is Ss from cartilaginous projection, about two ^f^^d'^^^lducts extend from the puncta to the is longer and more curved than the inferior ; the former is concave inferiorly • Ihe latter IS nearly straight, a little concave upwardsf’they both open into the external part of the sac, a little above its middle, sometimes by one, and sometimes bv distinct orifices, behind the tendo oculi; each duct surrounded by a process of that tendon, and lined bv mucous membrane. “7

418 the apex above, flattened before and behind; in some, from the effect of dress, it is of an ovoid form, being contracted at the lower part and wide in the middle; the anterior wall leads obliquely downwards and for- wards, and is shorter than the posterior, which is more vertical, and rendered very irregular by the vertebral grooves, and the angles of the ribs ; the sides are con- vex, particularly behind ; the intercostal spaces are short, but wide above, long and narrow in the middle, and again short below; they are broader before than behind. The apex is small, transversely oval, and very oblique from behind forwards and downwards; it is bounded by the first ribs, sternum and vertebral co- lumn ; the trachea, oesophagus, and the cervical ves- sels and nerves pass through it; the base is very large, also transversely oval, and very oblique from before backwards and dowwnwards, it is bounded by the xiphoid cartilage, the conjoined cartila- ges of the false ribs, and the vertebral column; it presents a great notch anteriorly, in which the xiphoid cartilage is, and posteriorly a small notch on each side for the vertebral column. The axis of the chest is ob- lique from above downwards and forwards, in conse- quence of the oblique direction of the sternum, hence if a line be made to ascend perpendicularly from the base, it will pierce the upper part of the sternum ; and not pass through the apex of the cavity. The dimen- sions, and even the form of the chest, vary in different individuals and at different ages. THE PELVIS. The Pelvis is the deep circular cavity at the lower end of the trunk, bounded by the sacrum, coccyx, and two ossainnominata; the latter in the young subject can be separated each into three, the ilium, ischium, and pubis. The Sacrum, in the erect position of the body, is placed at the upper and back part of the pelvis between the last lumbar vertebra above, the coccyx below, and the ossa inorainata on either side ; of a triangular form, the base resembles a vertebra, looks upwards and for-

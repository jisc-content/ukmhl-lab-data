to the lower and back part of the larynx; on the left side the recurrent nerve arises in tlie thorax, opposite the lower part of the arch of the aorta, under which it passes, and then attaching itself to the forepart of the oesophagus, ascends to the larynx, to the muscles of w iich It is distributed like that of the opposite side. At the inferior part of the neck the eighth pair of nerves enter the thorax ; that of the right side passes anterior to the subclavian artery, crossing it at a right angle ; that of the left side descends anterior but para,Ilel to the left subclavian artery. The ninth -pair, or lingual nerve, leaves the cranium by the anterior condyloid hole in the occipital bone, descends forwards and inwaids, nearly parallel to the digastric muscle, and is distributed to the muscles of the tongue; the arch which the course of this nerve describes is parallel, but inferior to that of the gustatory. From the con- vexity of this arch a long branch arises, the descendens noni; this descends along the fore part of the sheath of the carotid artery, communicates with the 2d and 3d cervical nerves about the middle of the neck, and is distributed to the sterno-hyoid and thyroid muscles: in some cases this nerve descends within the sheath behind the vein. The sympathetic nerve may be found descending along the vertebrae posterior to the carotid artery: this nerve commences at the base of the cra- nium in a long, oval, red swelling, the superior cervical ganglion, which extends as -low as the third cervical vertebra; from this the nerve becoming very small, de- scends almost vertically, and in general opposite the fifth cervical vertebra, it forms a second swelling, called the middle cervical ganglion ; from this, the small ner- vous cord continues its course down the neck, and opposite the 7th cervical vertebra and the neck of the first rib, it expands into a large irregular swelling, the inferior cervical ganglion, from the lower part of which the nerve descends into the thorax. (For the particu- lar description of the branches of the sympathetic, as well as of the cerebral nerves, met with in the dissec- tion of the neck, see the Anatomy of the Nervous Sys- tem.) On the side of the neck are seen numerous branches of the cervical spinal nerves ; there are eight

276 callosum is divided transversely, and the anterior por- tion raised forwards, the laminge of the septum separate, and this cavity becomes distinct; it is larger in the child, but is very irregular in size, and even in exist- ence in different subjects ; the septum lucidum appears to be formed by a lamina descending from each side of the raphe of the corpus callosum to the fornix, some grey matter superadded. Divide transversely the sep- tum lucidum and corpus callosum, raise forwards the anterior portion of the latter, and backwards its poste- rior part; it will now be seen that this substance is united to the fornix posteriorly, but is nearly an inch above it anteriorly ; the septum lucidum is generally so soft that in this stage of the dissection it will have nearly broke down into the surrounding fluid. The lateral ventricles extend from the middle of the brain into the anterior and posterior lobes, also to the inferior part of the middle lobe, hence they are named tricorne; the anterior cornu of each passes forwards and outwards, and are about an inch distant from each other ; the middle portion, or the body of each passes horizontally backwards, and are separated from each other by the septum lucidum ; near the posterior part of the corpus callosum the posterior and inferior cornua pass off in different directions ; the posterior cornu pro- ceeds into the posterior lobe at first outwards, after- wards it turns inwards in a curved direction, the con- cavity towards the median line ; the inferior cornu de- scends obliquely forwards atul outwards, and is then also curved a little inwards ; it terminates behind the fissure of Sylvius and beneath the anterior cornu. The anterior cornu is bounded superiorly and laterally by the corpus callosum, and inferiorly by the large extre- mity of the corpus striatum; the middle, or body of each, is bounded superiorly and externally by the cor- pus callosum ; internally by the septum lucidum, and inferiorly by the posterior extremity of the corpus stria- tum, the taenia semicircularis, the optic thalamus, the choroid plexus, and the fornix. The posterior cornu is bounded superiorly and laterally by the medullary sub- stance, and inferiorly by the hippocampus minor. The inferior cornu is bounded superiorly by the optic tha-

325 about half an inch external to the femoral artery; it is then covered by the fascia lata, becomes flat and broad, and divides into two fasciculi, a superficial and a deep; the superficial separates into four or five lone branches which pierce the fascia lata and descend alone the inner and fore.part of the thigh to the knee, some ot these accompany the saphena vein. The deep fasci- culus IS larger, it immediately divides into numerous muscular branches which supply the muscles on the outer and fore-part of the thigh ; they are divided into the external and internal branches, the former supply the vastus externus, rectus, iliacus internus, and tensor vaginae muscles ; the internal supply the sartorius, vas- tus internus, and crur^us; three or four accompany the femoral artery near to the knee ; two or three of these pass into the adjoining muscles, and one, the in- ternal saphenus nerve, continues to descend to the inner side of the knee between the tendons of the gracilis and sartorius; it then becomes attached to the saphena vein, and twines round this vessel as far as the inner side oi the foot; in this course it gives numerous filaments to the integuments of the leg. The ohtunitor nerve is smaller than the preceding, it arises chiefly from the third lumbar, it perforates the psoas, and descends ob- liquely inwards along the inner side of that muscle to the obturator foramen, through the upper part of which It escapes into the groin, where it is covered by the pec- tinaeus, and where it divides into its two branches an anterior and posterior, having previously sent some twigs to the obturator internus; the anterior branch is lost in the adductor brevis, pectinaeus, and vastus inter- nus, and communicates with the anterior crural • the posterior branch supplies the gracilis, the adductor magnus, and longus. The lumbosacral nerve proceeds from the fourth and fifth lumbar nerves into the pelvis and soon divides into two branches, the superior o]J! lu communicating; the gluteeal escapes hrough the upper part of the sciatic notch, and is dis- tributed to the glutaeus medius and minimus muscles along with the branches of the gluteal artery • the commcating branch joins the first of the folWintr nerves in the sacral or sciatic plexus. ^ F F

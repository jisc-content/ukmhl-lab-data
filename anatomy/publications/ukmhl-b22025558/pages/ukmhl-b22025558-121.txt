Ill Extensor Digitorum Communis, is situated more towards the back part of the forearm than the last de- scribed muscles; it arises in common with the last, and with the following, from the external condyle, the fascia, and its intermuscular processes, also from the ulna; it descends, and about the middle of the forearm ends in four tendons, which pass under the annular ligament in a groove in the radius, extend along the back of the hand, expanding as they approach the four fingers, into the phalanges of which they are inserted by a tendinous expansion. Use, to extend all the joints of the fingers: this muscle arises between the extensor carpi radialis brevis and extensor ulnaris ; it descends superficially between these, and over the supinator hrevis and ex- tensors of the thumb ; on the back of the hand the ten- dons are connected to each other by cross slips; that which goes to the ring finger is the largest; all the tendons, as they approach the base of the first phalanx, become thick but narrow; afterwards they enlarge and are joined by the tendons of the lumbricales and inteiâ€™- ossei; at the articulation of the first and second phalanx each divides into three bands; the middle one is inserted into the posterior surface of the second phalanx; the lateral pass along the sides of this articulation ; they afterwards converge and unite in a flat tendon, which is inserted into the base of the last or third phalanx. The back part of all the fingers is covered, as far as the last phalanx, by a tendinous expansion, derived from these tendons, and from those of the lumbricales and inter- ossei muscles. Extensor Carpi Ulnaris, arises tendinous and fleshy between the extensor communis and anconaeus, from the external condyle, fascia and intermuscular septa ; descends obliquely inwards, between the flexor ulnaris and extensor communis, towards the ulna, and receives an addition from it; it ends in a strong tendon, which runs through a groove on the back of the ulna, beneath the annular ligament, and is inserted into the carpal end of the fifth metacarpal bone. Use, to ex- tend the hand and bend it backwards ; also to adduct it. Ancon;eus, small, triangular, and placed at the outer side of the olecranon, beneath the skin; arises narrow

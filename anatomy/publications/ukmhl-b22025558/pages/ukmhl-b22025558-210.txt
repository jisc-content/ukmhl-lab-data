200 The Scrotum is a process of common integument continued from the inner side of each tiiigh, and from the perinaeum and penis; it is generally of a dark brown color, thinly covered with hair, and very rugged, being thrown into numerous rugae, it is so thin that the small sub-cutaneous veins and sebaceous follicles can be seen through it; the prominent hard ridge or raphe is continued from the perinaeum along its middle line as far as the penis. The Dartos is the cellular tissue im- mediately subjacent to the skin, it usually presents a red- dish appearance, a number of small vessels being buted through it; its texture is very loose, and is readdy distended in emphysema or in anasarca; it never contains any fat; it is somewhat more dense in the mesial line than at either side. The dartos is connected to the lami of the pubis and ischium of each side, and to the raphe m the middle, therice it ascends between the testes to the urethra, and thus assists in forming the scjdum scroti. The dartos manifests during life a degree ot contracti- lity above that which the cellular tissue enjoys m any other situation ; it has theretoi'e been consideied by some as a cutaneous muscle ; this idea is probably in- correct, although it certainly possesses the power ot corrugating the skin, distinct from that rolling motion of the testicle produced by the cremaster muscle; pos- teriorly the dartos frequently appears to derive a tew muscular fibres from the sphincter am. 1 he superjicial /ascia of the scrotum is continued from that ot the ab- domen around each spermatic cord and testicle; it is thin and loose, and becomes continuous with the tascia of the perinaeum : as this fascia envelopes the cord and testis on each side, it assists the dartos in forming the senium scroti, and so retains each testicle at its own sSe. The tunica communis is composed ot the expanded fibres of the cremaster muscle and ol fine connecting cellular membrane; this tunic surrounds the cord am testis : the fibres of the cremaster are expanded chiefi> on the fore-pait and sides of the testis. The tunica vaginalis was originally a process of the having been prolonged along the cord and around t testicfe as the latter was descending from the abdomen to a'e scrotum ; at this early age, the tunica vaginalis

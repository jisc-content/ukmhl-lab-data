213 CHAP. VII. SECTION I. DISSECTION OF THE FEMALE ORGANS OF GENERA- TION. The generative organs in the female are more dis- tinct from the urinary than in the male subject; they may be divided into the external and internal: the ex- ternal'parts are the mons veneris, vulva, labia, clitoris, nymphae, vagina, and perinaeum. The mons veneris is an eminence placed on the upper and anterior part of the pubes; it consists of a quantity of adipose substance beneath the integuments,which in the adult are covered with hair. The vulva is the fissure which extends from the mons veneris to within an inch of the anus. The perinceum is the small space in front of the anus. The labia are the thick folds of integument which extend pne on each side of the vulva, and are united inferiorly in a crescentic? edge, called the commissure or four- chette. The clitoris is between the superior extremity of the labia ; it is a small red projection immediately beneath the symphysis pubis and above the vagina ; it is attached by two crura to the rami of the pubes ; these unite and form the body of the clitoris, on the anterior extremity of which is a round red swelling called the glans clitoridis ; this is covered by a thin loose fold of integument called the prepuce. The clitoris is com- posed internally of a spongy cellular texture, not very unlike the corpus spongiosum urethrie in the male sub- ject. The nymphce, or labia minora, descend one on each side from the prepuce of the clitoris, and are gra- dually lost about, the centre of the vulva. About half an inch before the clitoris is the round orifice of the meatus urinarius; this opening is surrounded by a fold of mucous membrane. The meatus is from an inch and a half to two inches in length ; it leads backwards and upwards along the upper surface of the vagina, and

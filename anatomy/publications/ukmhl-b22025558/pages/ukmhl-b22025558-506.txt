496 should be made in a transverse direction, on the angle of the ribs ; in the upper part, the sound is sufficiently good ; in the lower it is slight, or often does not exist, especially on the right side, from the presence of the liver; on the left side it frequently gives an unnatu- rally clear sound, on account ot the distended state of the stomach. A CONCISE VIEW OF THE LIGAMENTS AND MUSCLES CONCERNED IN SIMPLE DISLOCATIONS. A SIMPLE dislocation is the separation of the articu- latory surfaces of a joint accompanied by rupture of li- gaments, but without fracture; by which the motions of the joint are impeded or suspended. The action of muscles with respect to luxations is of two kinds : one, in producing dislocation ; the other, in resisting reduc- tion. The first is a simple contraction of the muscle by which dislocation is produced when the articulating surfaces are placed in a position mechanically favouring this accident. The second is that slow contraction of the muscle, (called tonic,) which invariably takes place when the points of its attachment are approximated. E.xamples of both kinds are best illustrated by disloca- tions of the shoulder joint. When the arm is raised from the body violent action of the pectoralis major, latissimus dorsi and teres major muscles, may pull the head of the bone down into the axilla : and when this displacement has occurred, the contraction of the pec- toral and other muscles still going on, though more slowl}', will bring the head of the bone forwards to- wards the sternum and clavicle; and present a strong obstacle to reduction. OF DISLOCATION OF THE HEAD FROM THE FIRST CERVICAL VERTEBRA. A DISLOCATION of the head from the 6rst cervical vertebra has only been found in consequence of disease. The displacement may occur, either forwards, back- wards or to either side, compressing powerfully the spinal marrow. These kind of dislocations taking place tiom

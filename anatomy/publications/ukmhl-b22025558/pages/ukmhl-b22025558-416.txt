406 is also a posterior ligament, which is attached to the adjoining surfaces of the two bones the head of the astragalus is articulated to the navicular bone, the end of the os calcis is also connected to the latter by a strong fibro-cartilaginous substance called Calceo-na^ vicular ligament ; this extends from the inferior surface of the os calcis to the inferior part of the navicular, though not attached to the astragalus, it supports it, and completes the cavity for receiving its head; this liga- ment is strengthenedby the tendon ofthe tibialis posticus, which in this situation frequently contains a sesamoid bone or cartilage. A thin broad ligament above also connects the astragalus to the navicular. The os calcis is attach- ed to the cuboid by a synovial membrane and superior and inferior ligaments ; the latter is very strong, radiated anteriorly, and attached to the third and fourth metatar- sal bones. This articulation is exactly opposite to that between the astragalus and navicular bone; the opposite sides of the cuboid and navicular bones are connected by ligaments, and sometimes by a synovial membrane. The three cuneiform bones are attached to the navicular by a synovial membrane which also extends between these : they are all secured by superior and inferior transverse and oblique ligamentous bands. The meta- tarsal bones are secured to the tarsus and to each other by dorsal and plantar ligaments: the three internal are articulated to the cuneiform bones, and the two external to the cuboid bones ; all the metatarsal bones are also articulated to each other posteriorly by synovial mem- branes, except the first and second ; the anterior end of each metatarsal bone is connected to the first phalanx, and the phalanges to each other by synovial membranes and lateral ligaments as in the upper extremity.

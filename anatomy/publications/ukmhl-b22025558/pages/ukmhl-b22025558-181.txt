171 ' glions. At the last lumbar vertebra these nerves pass outwards and backwards, and then descend into the pelvis. The commencement ot the venu azijvos may be observed on the right ride of the aorta; it is formed by the first or second lumbar veins, which commu- nicate^ with the renal and inferior lumbar veins, and sometimes with the inferior vena cava. The vena azy- gos enters the thorax between the aorta and the riwiit crus of the diaphragm, and then ascends along the pos- terior mediastinum. The thoracic duct also may be seen to commence in the abdomen by the union of seve- ral absorbent vessels on the body of the third lumbar vertebra ; this vessel, being larger here than it is above, nas received the name of recepfacidum chyli; this, how- ever does not always exist. The thoracic duct is co- vered at first by the aorta, it then ascends obliquely to the right side, and enters the thorax between the aorta and vena azygos. Let the student next examine the urinary organs; these consistâ€”1st, of the kidneys which secrete the urine; 2d, of the ureters, which con- vey t Is fluid to 3d, the urinary bladder, which retains tinie; and 4th, the urethra, vrhich discharges it externally. dissection of the kidneys and ureters. Each kidney is situated in the posterior part of each umbar region, behind the peritonaeum, between the last nb and the crest of the ilium; and corresponds to the two last dorsal and two first lumbar vertebrm; the right if ^^ the left, particulariy if the liver be larger than usual; they are each imbedded in a quantity of soft adipose substance, and lie on the diaphragm, psoas, and quadratus lumborum muscles- he ascending colon and duodenum lie anterior to the ri^J descending colon to the left kidney; the nghtis in contact with the liver above, and with the c^cum below; and the left with the spleen abre; and

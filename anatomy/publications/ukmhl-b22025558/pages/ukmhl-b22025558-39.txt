joined together as to resemble one irregular glandular mass, the parotid being united to the submaxillary behind the angle of the jaw, and the latter being connected to the sublingual around the mylo-hyoid muscle. Hyo-glossus is flat and thin, arises from the cornu and part of the body of the os hyoides, ascends a little outwards, inserted into the side of the tongue. Use, to render the dorsum of the tongue convex by depressing its side; it may also elevate the os hyoides and base of the tongue. This muscle is covered by the mylo-hyoid in part, and by the sublingual gland and lingual nerve ; it lies on the middle constrictor of the pharynx, the lin- gual artery, and the substance of the tongue. Gsnio-hyo-Glossus is triangular, arises by a small tendon from an eminence inside the chin, beneath the fraenum linguae; thence the fibres radiate, the superior ascend and turn forwards towards the tip of the tongue, the middle also ascend, some inclining forwards, others backwards; the inferior and posterior pass backtvards and downwards to the base of the os hyoides.â€”Inserted into the mesial line of the tongue from the apex to the base, and into the body and lesser cornu of the os hy- oides. Use, the posterior fibres can draw the os hy- oides towards the chin and push the tongue forwards, the anterior can draw back the tongue, and bend its tip down towards the fraenum, the middle portion can de- press the middle of the tongue and make it concave from side to side; it can also draw it forwards so as to enlarge the opening of the fauces. This muscle is therefore used in mastication and deglutition, also in the articulation of several letters. The several muscles last described cover this muscle externally ; internally it is in contact with its fellow. Lingualis is a fasciculus of fibres taking a longitu- dinal course on the inferior surface of the tongue from the base to the apex, and intermixing with the mus- cles on either side, so that it appears as being derived from these rather than as a distinct muscle; the fibres are attached through their whole length, and are mixed with a soft fatty substance; anteriorly they are broader and more distinct; they are situated between u 2

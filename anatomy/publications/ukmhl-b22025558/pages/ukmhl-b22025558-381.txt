371 lanx ; Stli, 2jnlnw7is ^^fofunda j)asses across the meta- carpal bones, joins the deep branch of the ulnar, and thus forms the deep palmar arch, from which several j branches proceed to the inter-osseal muscles, and to the bones and ligaments of the metacarpus. The Thoracic Aorta gives off the bronchial, i CESophageal, and intercostal arteries. The bronchial arteries are two or three in number they arise from the fore-part of the aorta, below the j arch; they pass to either side, enter the back part of ! the root of each lung, and are lost in the cellular tissue of these organs; these arteries sometimes arise from the intercostal, they are very irregular in number and size. The cesophageal arteiies are also irregular, generally I thiee or four in number ; they arise from different parts I of the aorta, send branches to the mediastinum and I oesophagus; on the latter some ascend, others descend ; ij the former inosculate with the cervical arteries, the ■ latter with the abdominal. j| intercostal arteries, in general ten on the left, nine on the right side, the superior intercostal on the right side being larger than that on the left; they arise from the back part of the aorta, pass obliquely outwards behind the pleura, and enter the intercostal spaces, run along the lower edge of each rib between the layers of muscles, and about the middle of the chest divide into an inferior and superior branch ; the former smaller, runs along the superior border of the lower ■ rib; the latter continues in the grove in the upper • they both supply the intercostal muscles and send I branches through these to the pleura and to the su- : perficial muscles of the chest; they inosculate witli the internal mammary and with the thoracic arteries. Each intercostal artery, before it enters the intercostal i space, sends a large branch backwards between the I transverse process of the vertebrae to the muscles on 1 the posterior part of the trunk, these dorsal branches I ot the intercostal arteries also send small branches through the mter-vertebral holes along the spinal nerves ' to the medulla spinalis.

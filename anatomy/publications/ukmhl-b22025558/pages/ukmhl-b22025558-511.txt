oOl dorsi, and terres major, may, under certain circum- stances, effect this displacement of the bone. The del- toid and supra-spinatus muscles are those which most powerfully resist reduction. DISLOCATION FORWARDS. \\hen the head of the humerus is thrown forwards, it lies on the inner side ol' the neck of the scapula, be- tween it and the second and third ribs. The internal portion of the capsular lii:^ament and the tendon of the subscapularis are ruptured ; though examples have oc- curred in which the luxation has taken place without laceration of the tendons of any of the muscles sur- rounding the joint. As has been alre ady mentioned,the action of the muscles, attached to the greater tubercle of the humerus, counteracts forces tending to produce this species of displacement. DISLOCATION BACKWARDS. Dislocation backwards under the spine of scapula is extremely rare; it does not present any thing worthy of particular remark. In a case mentioned by Delpech, the head of the bone lay in immediate contact with the scapula, under the infra-spinalus muscle. OF dislocation of the elbow-joint. A dislocation of the elbow.joint most frequently takes place by a luxation backwards of both radius and ulna. The accident is sometimes complicated with a fracture of the coronoid process of the ulna. It is fa- cilitated by the relation of the articulating surfaces in the semi.flexed position of the arm ; when, if external violence be applied, the coronoid process slips behind the internal articular pulley of the humerus and is lodged in the sigmoid fossa, while the humerus is thrown for- wards on the radius and ulna. The external, internal and sometimes the annular ligament of the radius are ruptured, though the accident may occur without in, jury to any of these parts j occasionally the biceps and

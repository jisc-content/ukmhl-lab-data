247 of the second or last phalanx of the great toe. Use, to extend the great toe and flex the ankle ; it niay also adduct the foot, and rotate it inwards. The upper and middle portions of this muscle are overlapped and con- cealed by the tibialis anticus and extensor communis, between w’hich muscles it is situated ; its tendon is su- perficial , tile anterior tibial nerve and vessels separate it from the tibialis anticus above, and from the exten- sor communis below; it lies on the fibula and inter- osseous ligament above; inferiorly it crosses over the tibial vessels, the synovial membrane of the ankle joint, and the bones of the tarsus. Peron^us Tertius, or anticus, appears to be a portion of the extensor communis, and in some cases cannot be separated from it; it arises from the anterior surface of the lower half of the fibula; the fibres pass forw’ards to a tendon which descends along with that of the extensor communis beneath the annular liga- ment; it then passes forwards and outwards, and is in- serted broad and thin into the base of the fifth meta- tarsal bone, and it frequently sends a band of fibres to join the fourth tendon of the extensor communis Lse, to extend the little toe, to flex the ankle, to ab- duct the toot, and raise its outer edge. This muscle IS sometimes wanting, an additional tendon from the extensor communis will then supply its place; it is superficial ; on the foot it conceals the extensor brevis, which may be next examined. Extensor Digitorum Brevis, situated on the up- per surface of the foot, arises tendinous and fleshy from the upper and anterior part of the os calcis, anterior to the groove for the peronaeus longus, also from the cu- boid bone, the astragalus, and the annular ligament- It forms a flat fleshy belly, which passes forwards and’ inwards, ends in four flat tendons, of which the two internal are the strongest; the little toe does not re- ceive any; these tendons are inserted thus : the first or most internal, into the base of the first phalanx of the great toe ; the three other tendons join the outer edee ot the corresponding tendons of the extensor digitorum ongus, and assist in forming the aponeurosis which covers the dorsum of each toe. Use, to extend the

234 gament, the fibres run parallel to the former, and are also inserted into the digital fossa. Use, to rotate the thigh outwards, also to abduct it, to strengthen the capsular ligament and to confine the obturator tendon in its situation. These muscles are concealed by the glutaeus maximus and the sciatic nerve; they are placed between the pyriformis and the quadratus fe- moris muscles : they form a sort of sheath around the tendon of the obturator internus, and adhere to its edges; they appear as portions of this muscle added to it as it escapes from the pelvis; tbe inferior is the larger of the two ; the superior is inserted between the pyriformis and the obturator internus, and the inferior between the tendons of the obturator internus and ex- ternus : they both adhere to the capsular liganient. Obturator Internus, is situated partly within the pelvis and partly behind the ilio-femoral articulation; somewhat triangular, the base within the pelvis, the apex at the great trochanter, arises by aponeurotic and fleshy fibres within the pelvis from the superior or pel- vic surface of the obturator or thyroid ligament, and from all the circumference ot the foramen of that name, except at the upper part where the obturator nerve and vessels pass through ; beneath these a ligamentous arch is extended, and from this some fibres of this muscle proceed ; it also arises from the pubis inter- nally, and from the ischium infenorly, and from a thin but'^strong fascia of the same name, which covers this muscle and separates it from the levator am rtiuscle ; the fibres descend obliquely outwards and backiyards, converging towards the lesser sciatic notch, which is Ltween the spine and the tuberosity of the ischium; the fibres here end in a flat tendon, which turning out- wards, winds round the cartilaginous pulley-hke sur- face which the ischium here presents, a loose bu .a, and one, in general, containing a ^ is here interposed between this tendon and the bone the tendon now runs outwards on the dorsum ot tl e pelvis, between the gemini muscles and is !he digital fossa of the great trochanter.

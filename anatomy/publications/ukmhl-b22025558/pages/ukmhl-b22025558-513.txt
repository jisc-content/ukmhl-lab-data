503 prominent projection at the back part. The annular and accessory ligaments are ruptured, and sometimes a small portion of the interosseous. The action of the triceps will contribute to keep the bone in this position, wliile on the contrary, the brachialis internus assists in the reduction. OF DISLOCATIONS OF THE JOINT OF THE WRIST. The wrist joint may be dislocated either by the radius and ulna being both thrown forwards, or both back- wards. Lateral dislocations are always partial. As theÂ«e displacements always occur by falls on the ground or other violence, by which the hand is forcibly bent on the bones ol the fore-arm, extensive laceration of the capsular, anterior, or posterior ligaments, must accom^ pany them. The tendons also of the flexor and exten- sor muscles are more or less displaced, and some of them may be ruptured. The form of the arch of the first range of metacarpal bones favours the dislocation back- vyards, since from their greater convexity in this direc- tion, they do not afiord as much support to the bones of the fore-arm. OF DISLOCATION OF THE CARPAL EXTREMITY OF THE RADIUS. The carpal extremity of the radius may be dislocated either forwards or backwards ; the first of these acci- dents IS much the more frequent. The bone is thrown fonvards on the scaphokl and os trapezium. The can- iular and anterior ligaments alone are ruptured. If the head of tl.e radius be thrown back from its articulating sur aces, the back part of the capsule, the posteriof ll thewrii,! the back Separate dislocaUon of the carpal extremity of the ulna takes place either forwards or backwards. The only circumstance worthy of notice is the difliculty of keeping the bone in its place, in consequence ofW- rupture of iIjc sacciform ligarreiit.

459 tiie fibula, on the anterior part of the head is a convex, triangular surface looking forwards and downwards, pierced with many vascular holes, and terminating in a tu eicle, to the upper pari of which a bursa adheres, aiid into the lower the ligamentum patellte is inserted. e upper or femoral surface of the tibia presents two concave or articulating surfaces or coridyles covered with cartilage, for articulating with the femur, the in- ternal IS oval and the deeper of the two, it is also larger trom before backwards ; the external is nearly circurar, ver^ superficial, and looks obliquely downwards and out- wards ; these are separated by a spine, which is of a py- rami al form, inclines upwards and inwards and is sur- mounted by two tubercles; it is nearer the back than e orepart of the bone ; a large flat depressed surface iies anterior to it and a smaller depression behind it • the semilunar cartilages and the crucial ligaments are’ inserted into these ; the body of the tibia is triangular, Its size diminishes from its head for about two-?hirds down. It then increases somewhat towards its lower end; its inner side is convex above and a little concave heJow it IS directed obliquely forwards, is covered su- periorly by the tendinous expansions of the sartoriu' gracilis, and semitendinosus, but the remainder of it is subcutaneous; the external side appears a little twisted it IS concave above to support the tibialis anticus mus- cle, but convex below to support the tendon of that muscle as also those of the extensors ; its posterior sur- ace, which is also broader above than below, is slif^htlv convex ; it presents superiorly a prominent line patsing obliquely downwards and outwards for the insertion o^f the pophtffius and the origin of the solmus and the deep opening of the large canal medullary membrane, it Jams obliquely downwards and forwards. The tibia presents three edges, one is anterior and very promi- .lent about .lie middle, but leas so above andVuTetl 'If* '1'^ subcutaneous, it is twisted like the tibia itself and is commonly called the crest or the shin hi?

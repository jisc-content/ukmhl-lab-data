163 depressions are indistinctly marked in some subjects ; they are separated from each other by the extremity of the lobulus caudatus ; eighth, a superficial depression on the under surface of the left lobe, corresponding to the anterior surface of the stomach; ninth, a broad notch in the posterior edge of the liver, corresponding to the spine and to the right crus of the diaphragm ; the vente cavae hepaticae leave the liver in this situation. The liver is of a peculiar brown colour, interspersed with yellow ; in some subjects it is much darker than in others ; in the very young it is red and soft, and in the old it is generally pale and yellow, and often hard and brittle; it has two coats, a serous and fibrous; the serous, or peritoneal tunic covers the whole surface of the liver, except in those situations where the vessels, either open or obliterated, are situated, and between the laminae of the coronary ligament, also in the de- pression, in which the gall bladder is lodged. The 2d, or fibrous coat, is the immediate capsule to the gland; It IS thin, little more than condensed cellular mem- brane; it is inost distinct and strong where the serous coat is deficient; it covers the whole surface of the liver, and adheres to it by innumerable shreds or pro- cesses, which pass into its substance ; it also accompa- nies those vessels of the liver which enter or leave the transverse fissure, and forms a capsule or sheath around throughout tlie entire organ ; this sheath receives the name of the capsule of Glisson ; it surrounds the vessels very loosely, and also encloses loose cellular tissue ; hence it is, that if these vessels be divided by a perpendicular incision through the liver they will be found to collapse and recede ; whereas if the yen® cav® hepatic®, which run from the thin to- wards the thick edge of the liver, be divided by a trans- verse incision through the liver, they will not recede or collapse, but remain perfectly open, in consequence of the absence of this sheath, and of their close adhesion to the substance of the liver. The structure of the liver consists of numerous small granulations of a brown and yellow colour, connected together by the branches of the hepatic arteries, veins, and ducts; these grains are ca led acm of ,hc liver, in each of them aiench oT le hepatic artery and vena porta terminate, and out of

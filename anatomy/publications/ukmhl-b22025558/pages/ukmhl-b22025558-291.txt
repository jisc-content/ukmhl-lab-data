281 ihe third ventricle a small canal leads backwards and downwards, above and behind the pons Varolii, and below the tubercula quadrigemina, this is the aqueduct of Sylvius, or the iter ad quartum ventriculum. The anterior commissure is a distinct round cord, extend- ing from one hemisphere to the other, immediately be- fore the anterior pillars of the fornix, bent like an arch, convex anteriorly, unattached in its central portion, but on each side it is imbedded in the corpus striatum, through which it descends obliquely backwards and out- wards, and then terminates in rays near the fissure of Sylvius, and the inferior cornu of the lateral ventricle : it is enclosed in a delicate sheath of pia mater, like a nen'e. The posterior commissure is shorter and smaller than the anterior, but white, round, and fibrous like it; it extends transversely behind the third ventricle, above the aqueduct of Sylvius, below the pedunculi of the pi- neal gland to which it is connected, and anterior to the tubercula quadrigemina ; its extremities are connected to the optic thalami. The tubercula quadrigemina are below this commissure, and the pineal gland, they are all connected by their bases, on an oblique plane, and separated from each other near their points by two su- perficial grooves; the two superior and anterior are called the nates, the two inferior and posterior the testes, white on their surface, grey internally, they lie above and behind the aqueduct of Sylvius, which alone sepa- rates them from the pons Varolii; the nates are con- nected to the optic thalami, and the testes to the cere- bellum, by two thin white plates, which descend ob- liquely backwards and outwards, and end in the sub- stance of the cerebellum; these are the processus a ce- rebello ad testes ; the diverge towards the cerebellum, and are continuous externally and inferiorly with a thick, round, white process, the crus cerebelli; between these two processes there is a thin lamina extended named the valve of Vieussens, or. of the fourth ventricle, cineritious and very soft, triangular, the apex between the testes, the base attached to the cerebellum, and the sides to the two processes just described ; this valve forms the roof of the fourth ventricle.

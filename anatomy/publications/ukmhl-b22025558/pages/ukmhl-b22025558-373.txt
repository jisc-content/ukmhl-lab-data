3G3 The Ophthalmic Artery arises close to the anterior clinoid process, passes forwards through the optic foramen, below the optic nerve and external to it; in the orbit it rises above this nerve and twines round it to the inner side of this cavity, along which it passes to the inner canthus, where it terminates; while on the outer side of the optic nerve it sends off, 1st, centralis retime, very small, pierces the sheath of the optic nerve, passes along the centre of the latter, into the eye, where it divides into delicate ramifications; these spread along the internal layer of the retina, and one. or two pierce the vitreous humour, and extend to the capsule of the lens ; 2nd, the lachrymal passes along the external rectus muscle, and supplies the lachrymal gland, and the external part of the palpebrae: while -above the optic nerve it gives off; 3rd \A\q supra-orhilal, which passes forwards along the levator palpebrae, and through the superciliary notch, supplies the muscle.s and integuments of the eye-brow, and ascending on the forehead, divides into several branches, which are dis- tributed to the scalp, and communicate with the tempo- ral and occipital arteries; 4 th, the posterior ciliary, ten or twelve in number, very small, surround the optic nerve, and pierce the back part of the sclerotic ; pass be- tween it and the choroid, and are distributed to the lat- ter; some of their branches continue as far as the ciliary processes and the iris; 5th, long ciliary, one on each side; they pass horizontally forwards, between the sclerotic and choroid membranes, as far as the ciliary circle; here they divide, and form a circular inosculation round the circumference of the iris, from this several branches radiate inwards, and again unite in a circle near the pupil; 6th, muscular arteries, to the differ- ent muscles in the orbit ; 7th, ethmoidal, passes through the posterior orbital foramen to the mucous' naembrane in the ethmoid cells; 8th, superior and inje- rior palpebral, to the palpebrae, caruncula, conjunctiva, and lachrymal sac; 9th, nasal, passes beneath the trochlea, along the side of the nose, and inosculates with the labial artery ; 10th, frontal, ascends to the eve- brow and forehead.

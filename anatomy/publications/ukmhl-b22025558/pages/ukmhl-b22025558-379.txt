369 The injerior profunda arises opposite the tendon ot the coraco-brachialis, descends on the surface of the triceps, along with the ulnar nerve, to the inner condyle, and communicates with the ulnar recurrent. The anastomotica arises about two inches above the joint, passes inwards, supplying the adjacent muscles, and inosculating with the preceding and with the ulnar recurrent arteries. Jn the triangular hollow at the bend of the elbow, the brachial artery divides into the radial and ulnar. The ulnar artery is the larger of the two, it de- scends along the ulnar side of the fore-arm to the palm of the hand, covered superiorly by the superficial flexors and pronators, and by the median nerve; in- feiiorly by the skin and fascia, overlapped, however, by the tendons of the flexor digitorum sublimis and flexor carpi ulnaris, between which it descends to the wrist; it passes over the brachiaeus anticus, flexor pro- fundus, pronator quadratus, the annular ligament of the carpus and the flexor tendons in the palm of the hand; it is accompanied by two veins, and by the ulnar nerve, the latter descends along its ulnar side; it gives off, 1st, the anterior ulnar recurrent, which ascends in front of the inner condyle, on the brachiseus anticus, and inos- culates with the anastomotica; 2d, the posterior idnar recurrent, large and tortuous, ascends behind the inner coudyle, along the ulnar nerve, and anastomoses with the anastomotica and inferior profunda arteries ; 3d, in- ter.osseal artery, passes backwards and divides into an anterior and posterior branch; the anterior inter-osseal artery descends along the fore-part of the inter-osseal membrane, beneath the deep flexors, pierces that membrane near the pronator quadratus, and de- scends on the back part of the carpus, and is distribu- ted to the carpal bones, and to the sheaths of the ex- tensor tendons ; the posterior inter-osseal artery passes backwards beneath the anconaeus, and descends along the back of the fore-arm, sending its branches to the ex- tensor muscles; this artery superiorl)^ sends a very large recurrent branch in the anconaeus muscle to the olecranon, to communicate with the superior profunda ; 4th, muscidar branches to the two layers of

4G4 the calcaneum, anteriorly it presents two articular sur- faces, the internal is square and supports the 4th meta- tarsal bone, the external is triangular and supports the 5th ; the external side is narrow, the internal is rough posteriorly but presents anteriorly two articulating sur- faces, the posterior for the scaphoid, and the anterior for the external cuneiform bone ; the cuboid is articu- lated with the calcaneum, the scaphoid, the external cuneiform, and the two external metatarsal bones. , The Cuneiform Bones; these three wedge-shaped bones are situated at the anterior part of the tarsus, be- tween the scaphoid and the three internal metatarsal bones ; the 1st or the internal is the largest of the three, its base is below and its long axis is from above down- wards, it is articulated posteriorly to the scaphoid bone, anteriorly to the 1st and externally to the second me- tatarsal bone, and to the middle cuneiform, inferiorly it presents a tubercle for the insertion of the tibialis anticus, and for a portion of the tendon of the tibialis posticus; the middle cuneiform is th'^ smallest, and is wedged in between the two others; it is also articulated behind to the scaphoid and before to the 2nd metatarsal bone; the 3rd or external cuneiform bone is situated be- ween the last and the cuboid bone, it is articulated an- teriorly with the 3rd metatarsal bone; posteriorly with the scaphoid, internally with the middle cuneiform and with the 2nd metatarsal bone, and externally with the cuboid, and with the 4th metatarsal bone. All the bones of the tarsus are composed of a soft spongy vascular tissue covei'ed by a compact, but thin lamina; they are each developed from one point of ossification, except the calcaneum and the astragalus, which com- mence each in two points. The Metatarsal Bones are five in number, the 1st or internal is the shortest and thickest, convex above, concave and sharp below, its posterior end is oval, con- cave, and rests on the internal cuneiform bone, the an- terior end round and smooth, supports the 1st or great toe, this extremity is grooved below, and lodges the sesamoid bones, the peronaeus longus is also in- serted into it ; the 2nd is the longest of the metatarsal bones, its tarsal end is wedged in between the three 1

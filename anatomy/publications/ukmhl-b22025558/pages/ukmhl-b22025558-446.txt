The Ethmoid Bone is situated in the notch between the orbital plates of the frontal bone, and forms the roof of the nostrils; it is so named from its cribriform or sieve-like appearance, it is of a cuboid figure, and composed of many thin, brittle, semi-transparent la- minte placed in every direction so as to form cells, these enlarge the surface of the nose without increas- ing the size or weight, for this bone is remarkably light; it consists of a middle perpendicular lamina and two symmetrical portions; its superior or cerebral sur- face is broad, and covered by the dura mater, in its posterior edge is a notch which receives a-process of the sphenoid bone, along the middle line is a hard ridge, which anteriorly rises into a remarkable process, the crista galli, to which the beginning of the falx is attached, this process ends before in two short wings which join the os frontis, and which often assist in bounding the foramen cmcum ; on either side of this process is a channel deeper before than behind, this lodges the olfactory nerves; anterior to each of these, and nearer to the process, is a small slit which transmits the nasal branch of the ophthalmic nerve ; this entire surface is perforated by numerous holes, about ten or twelve of these are large and are placed over the late- ral parts of the bone, the remainder are very small and are on either side of the median line, they each lead into a small vertical canal lined by dura mater; from the inferior surface of this plate, there descends the nasal lamella in the middle and a large spongy cellular mass on either side ; the nasal lamella is in the median line, it is thick above and behind where it joins the sphenoid, thin below where it joins the vomer and na- sal cartilage, and very thick before where it unites to the nasal process of the os frontis and to the nasal bones, its sides are marked with the canals for the ol- factory nerves, short and oblique before, vertical and very long in the middle and behind, they descend for about half the depth of the plate, and become converted into mere grooves; on either side ot this septum is a

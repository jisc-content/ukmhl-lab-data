318 to the oesophagus and stomach, these communicate with the vagus and solar plexus. The plirenic nerve can be traced into the spinal canal, and be seen to arise distinctly from the side of the spinal marrow. The external descending branches of the cervical plexus are numerous, some are superficial, others deep, the superficial descend to the clavicle and acromion pro- cess, supply the superficial muscles in their course, and terminate in the pectoral and deltoid muscles and in the integuments; the deep branches descend behind the clavicle, supply the deep muscles on the side of the neck and those connected to the scapula; one of these branches is remarkable for its length, it is of the same size as the phrenic, and is named the external respiratory nerve of the trunk; this nerve proceeds from the back part of the plexus, chiefly from the fourth cervical, it has also filaments connecting it to the 3d and 2d, and to the phrenic, it descends behind the scaleni muscles and beneath the trapezius and levator anguli scapulae, and is almost exclusively distributed to the serratus magnus muscle. The Brachial Plexus is formed by the junction of the anterior branches of the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th cervical, and of the 1st dorsal ; this plexus is broad and flat, the nerves forming it are very large, particu- larly the inferior; it is situated at the inferior and late- ral part of the neck, between the scaleni muscles and above the subclavian artery, it then descends obliquely outwards beneath the clavicle and subclavian muscle and over the first rib, into the axilla, \v4iere it rests on the serratus magnus behind the axillary artery and vein. The 5th and 6th cervical unite first, the 7th cervical runs alone for some distance, the 8th cervical and 1st dorsal unite immediately, so that, at first this plexus consists of three roots, these however soon unite, and in the axilla again separate and subdivide into seve- ral branches : the branches of this plexus are the tho- racic, supra and sub-scapular, the internal and external cutaneous, the median, ulnar, musculo-spiral, and cir- cumflex. The thoracic branches arise principally from the upper part of the plexus, arc four or five in num-

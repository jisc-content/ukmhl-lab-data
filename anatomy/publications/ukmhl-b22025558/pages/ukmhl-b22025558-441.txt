431 it is developed from one point of ossification, whicli is in the parietal prominence; it is joined to live bones, viz. the frontal, sphenoid, temporal, occipital and to its fellow. The Occipital Bone is curved and of a rliomboidal figure, placed at the posterior and inferior part of the cranium; it presents two surfaces, the external or pos- terior, or basilar, is convex, smooth above, presents near the centre the great proluberance to which the cervical ligament is connected; from each side of this leads the superior transverse ridge to which the occi- pito-frontalis, trapezius and complexus muscles are attached; midway between this and the foramen mag- num, is the inferior transverse ridge, to which the splenii, recti majores and obliqui superiores are at- tached ; from the tuberosity a spine leads down verti- cally in the median line as far as the foramen magnum ; this latter is of an oval figure, and transmits the medulla spinalis, the vertebral vessels, and the suboccipital nerves ; it is larger internally than externally ; in front ot this is the basilar process, which is very thick and strong,^ it passes forwards and a little upwards into the base of the skull to join the sphenoid bone; its sides are rough and contiguous to the petrous bones; it is also rough inferiorly, for the attachment of muscles and the mucous membrane of the pharynx; near the forepart of the foramen are the condyles, smooth and oblong, covered with cartilage, looking downwards, outwards, and backwards; their anterior and inner edges are the deepest, their long axis is from before backwards, in which direction, as also from side to side they are convex, they are uneven internally near their centre, for the insertion of the lateral ligaments from the odontoid process ; they are articulated to the atlas ; behind these is a fossa in which there is generally a small foramen through which a vein and small artery pass, and before them is another fossa in which there IS always a foramen for the ninth pair of nerves; exter- nal to each condyle is the jugidar eminence, semilunar, bounding posteriorly the foramen lacerum, and giving attachment to the rectus lateralis muscle. The uppew angle is acute ; the edges very irregular, as also along

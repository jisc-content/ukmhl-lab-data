270 bones, and ends in the lateral sinus near its termina- tion. The tratisverse sinus leads from one inferior pe- trosal sinus to the other, across the cuneiform process of the occipital bone. The occipital sinuses are two small canals contained in the falx cerebelli; they receive veins from the cerebellum, and sometimes from the vertebral canal, and open into the torcular Herophili; these sinuses sometimes extend along each side of the foramen magnum, and communicate with the lateral sinuses ; the occipital sinuses are olten wanting. Ihe torculi Herophili is a sort of common reservoir in which several sinuses end; it is situated opposite the tubero- sity of the occipital bone, and enclosed between the layers of the falx and tentorium ; it is somewhat oval, and presents six openings, viz. the lateral sinus on each side ; the longitudinal sinus above, the straight sinus before, and the occipital sinuses below. The second covering of the brain is a serous mem- brane, the arachnoid, so fine and delicate that in some situations it is difficult to demonstrate it; between the convolutions of the brain it can be raised from the pia mater, which sinks into the fissures between these; and a little air forced between these membranes will sepa- rate them for some distance, and will raise the arach- noid membrane in a vesicular form ; on the base of the brain, and in the spinal canal, it is stronger, and can be distinctly detached from the subjacent mem- brane. The arachnoid membrane covers the whole surface of the brain, and is thence reflected to the dura mater, which it lines throughout, except at the sella turcica, where the pituitary gland intervenes between these membranes ; from the surface of the brain it is reflected on the dura mater in several situations, viz. superiorly, as the veins enter the longitudinal sinur, this membrane accompanies them from the brain to the sinus, it is then reflected to the inner surface of the dura mater: interiorly, also, it surrounds the n^es m their course from the brain to the which they pass, and is then reflected on 11 e ^ a mater, the latter membrane being really continued for a short distance around ^ whereas the arachnoid membrane forms ;a cul de .

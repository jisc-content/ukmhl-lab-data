331 nerves by one filament, and with each of tlie dorsal, lumbar, and sacral nerves by two; the sympathetic nerves may either be considered as independent parts ot the nervous system communicating by numerous branches with every portion of that system, or they may each be regarded as a nervous cord formed by the union ot branches from all the spinal and from several ot the cerebral nerves ; the latter is probably the more correct view. The sympathetic nerves send off nu- merous branches, which are chiefly destined to supply the heart and the coats of the great vessels and all the pelvic and abdominal viscera except the stomach ; these branches arise from the ganglions on these nerves; of these there are generally three in the neck; in the back and loins they correspond with the number of vertebra in those regions, and in the pelvis there are three on each side and the coccygeal or impar gan- glion below ; these ganglions and their branches must be next examined. The Cervical Ganglions are three, the superior, middle, and inferior; the superior cervical ganglion is of an oval figure and reddish colour, extending from the first to the third cervical vertebra, placed on the rectus capitis anticus, behind the carotid artery and jugular vein, and internal to the eighth and ninth cerebral nerves ; this ganglion sends off several branches, viz. superior, interior, internal, external, and anterior ; the superior branches are two in number ; they ascend in the carotid canal to the cavernous sinus, and communicate with the sixth, and with the vidian branch of the fifth ; in this situation a plexus and sometimes a ganglion may be observed on the external surface of the artery, fine soft reddish filaments pass from this to the several nerves which are about to enter the orbit through the foramen lacerum, also to the gasserian ganglion of the fifth, and several continue attached to the carotid artery, and are lost in its cerebral branches. The inferior or descend- ing branches of the superior ganglion are small fila- ments to join the laryngeal nerves and the vagus, the superior cardiac nerve, (to be described presently,) and the continued cord of the sympathetic itself. The in- tcrnal branches unite with the phryngeal plexus; the

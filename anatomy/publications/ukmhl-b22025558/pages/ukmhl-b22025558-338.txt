328 torum longus ; to these and to the short peronaei muscles it sends several muscular branches; about tlie middle of the leg, it perforates the fascia, and a little above the outer malleolus it divides into the internal and external tarsal nerves or dorsal nerves of the foot; the internal is distributed to the integuments of the first and second toes, and communicates with the internal saphenus nerve and with the anterior tibial; the external sup- plies the integuments on the three outer toes, and com- municates with the internal branch and with the exter. nal saphenus nerve. The anterior tibial tierve descends obliquely forwards along with the anterior tibial artery between the tibialis anticus and the extensor digitorum longus and extensor pollicis, which muscles it supplies ; it also sends branches through the fascia to the integu- ments ; it then passes beneath the annular ligament of the tarsus, and runs to the inter-osseous muscle between two first metatarsal bones ; on the foot it sends a large branch to the extensor digitorum brevis, also several cutaneous and communicating filaments, and it termi- nates by supplying the first inter-osseal muscle and the integuments of the two internal toes; in the first interos- seal space a small branch communicates with the plan- tar nerves. The internal jjopliteal or posterior tibial nerve is larger than the preceding; it descends nearly vertically between the heads of the gastrocnemius and solaeus muscles, and behind the articulation of the knee and the poplitseus muscle ; it then descends obliquely inwards beneath the solseus and on the tibialis posticus and flexor digitorum longus, to the arch beneath the heel and the internal ankle; it here divides into the internal and external plantar nerves. In the ham a quantity of fat separates this nerve from the popliteal vessels; below the knee it becomes more closely con- nected to them, lying superficial and a little to their in- ner or tibial side; at the lower edge of the pophtaeus it passes CO the outer or fibular side of the posterior tibial artery and descends in that relation to this vessel as far as the internal malleolar region. The posterior tibial nerve above the knee gives oftâ€™ a small nerve, the poste- rior or external saphenus; this descends al^ong t le back of the leg, at first covered by the fascia, afterwards

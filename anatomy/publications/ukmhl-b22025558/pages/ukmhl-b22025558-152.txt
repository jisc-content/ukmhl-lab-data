142 teriorly ami laterally by the abdominal muscles, infe- riorly by the true and false pelvis, and posteriorly by the lumbar vertebrm, the crura of the diaphragm, and the psoae and quadrat! lumborum muscles. Although the expression “ cavity of the abdomen” is in common use, it is not correct, for during life there is no cavity, as the diaphragm and abdominal muscles by their alter- nate action keep up such a constant and uniform pres- sure on the viscera, that these and the parietes are always in perfect contact. The abdomen contains the peritonaeum and the organs of digestion; the kidneys, renal capsules and ureters ; also the thoracic duct, the aorta, vena cava, and the numerous branches of these vessels. The abdomen is very generally divided by anatomical writers into nine, and by some into twelve different regions; by drawing two transverse lines, one between the extremities of the cartilages of the 9th ribs, and the other between the anterior superior spi- nous processes of the ossa ilii, we may define three regions ; the epigastric above, the umbilical in the mid- dle, ami the hypogastric below; and then by drawing a vertical line on each side from the extremity of the ninth rib to the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium, we shall subdivide each of these regions into three parts : the three divisions of the epigastric region are the epigastrium, or scrobiculus cordis in the centre, and the right and left hypochondriac regions on either side; the ejrigastrium is immediately below the ensi- form cartilage, and the hypochondriac regions are co- vered by the fcdse ribs; the lateral portions of the umbilical division are the lumbar regions; the middle of the hypogastric region is the hypogastrium, and the lateral portions are the iliac regions ; the lower part of the hypogastrium is called by some the pubic region, and the lower part of each iliac division is called inguinal region, and contains the iliac vessels, and in the male the spermatic cord, and in the female the round ligament of the uterus. Ihe visceia, which con- stantly or occasionally occupy^ the otiier regions of the abdomen wdll be seen when the peritonaeal cavity has been opened, and rvith these the student should make himself familiar, as this knowledge may be of practical

146 patic vessels, is called the lesser or the gastro-hepatic omentum ; it is also sometimes named the capsule ot Glisson ; at the lesser arch of the stomach the two la- minae of this process separate to enclose the stomach, the posterior layer giving a serous covering to the back part of this organ, and in like manner the anterior layer covering its anterior surface, on which it is continuous with that portion of peritonaeum w'hich has descended from the diaphragm, and with that which is also con- tinued from the spleen to the stomach. The perito- rseum having thus enclosed the stomach and its vessels between the two layers of the lesser omentum, we next observe that these laminae having passed tlie great cur- vature of the stomach touch each other, and being j. ioed b}' the peritonaeum from the lower end of the spleen, de- scend under the name ot the gastro-colic or the gieat omentum, to the lower part of the abdomen : in general it descends lower on the left side than on the tight , it then turns on itself, and ascends obliquely baclwards to the arch of the colon, along the convex edge ot which its laminae separate to enclose this intestine and its yes- sels ; along the concave edge of the colon these laminae apai'n unite, and increasing in density form that process wdiich is called the transverse meso-colon, which passes backwards to the spine ; opposite the duodenum this process separates into an ascending and descending layer; the inferior division of the duodenum lies be- tvveen these ; the ascending layer proceeds in front ot the lower and middle divisions of the duodenum, up to the back part of the right lobe of the liver, "’I’ere comes continuous with the peritonaeal tumc ot that vis- cus and with the posterior layer ot the which is descending along the back part of the hepatic vessels. The descending layer of the transverse meso- colon expands into each lumbar region, in which it at- taches the lumbar portions of the colon ^ ture called the right and left lumbar meso-colon , in I e centre the inferior layer of the transverse «ieso-colon adheres to the vertebral column, and to the sels which lie upon it, and is thence reflected orwaid^ and downwards over the small intestines and their ve. scls, and returns around these to the spine, thus toim-

457 rotators of the limb, namely, tlie pyriform, gemelli and oDturaiors; the summit of the trochanter is thick and rough, the glutaeus medius is inserted into it, the an- erioi edge IS broad, and gives attaciiment to the sluteeus inimmus, into the posterior, which is round and thick, e qua ratus femoris is inserted. The lesser trochanter s a conical projection at the posterior and inner side of he shaft, and considerably below the great trochanter ; U looks backwards and inwards, the tendons of the psoas and ihac muscles are inserted into it behind its apex, a bursa is connected to it anteriorly. The inferior or of the femur is very large and broad, and di- " 0 eminences or condyles which are separated Fk ^ ^ y a deep notch; the coizr/w/eiarticulate with IF ^ f is larger, and projects more for- ward than the internal, its articulating surface is also broader and ascends higher, externally it is rough and presents a tuberosity which gives attachment to the ex- ternal latera ligament of the knee joint; this is less internal tubercle, beneath this bercle is a groove which receives the tendon of the p phtaeus rnuscle in the flexed position of the joint ■ ternally this condyle presents a rough surfaci to- wards the posterior part of which the anterior crucial -amerit IS inserted, it is very convex behind, flat be- fbre and broad below. The internal condyle is narrower, ess prominent before but prolonged more behind • it is also longer than the external, an"d therefore de ce c lower when the fcmur is vertical, but both are nearly on a level when the bone is in its ordinary oblique di- tubercle for the attach- for ligament of the knee and roF I tendon; to its outer side, which is ugh, the anterior crucial ligament adheres ; both con- d}les are more convex behind than before, they are by ^ deep uneven notch, which odges the crucial ligaments and is deprived of articular cartilage; anteriorly they are continued into each other and unite in a pulley-hke surface which is convex from above downwards, and concave from side to side, hiaher externally than internally; this trochlea is chiefly formed the external condyle, it supports the patella ; the It H

10 missure of ihe lips. The buccinator is covered by a con- siderable quantity of fat, which often extends in the form of large, soft, round masses beneath the masseter muscle; also by the zygomatic and depressor anguli oris mus- cles ; several branches of the facial artery and vein, and of the 7th and 5th pair of nerves ramify on its surface, it lies on the mucous membrane, and on a number of small round mucous glands called buccal; this muscle is perforated near its superior posterior third by the duct of the parotid gland, opposite the third superior molar tooth. The deep muscles of the face, which are connected with the lower maxilla, and are employed in the pro- cess of mastication, are the masseter, temporal, inter- nal, and external pterygoid of each side; previous to dissecting these, the student should examine the situa- tion and connexion of the parotid gland, one of the sa- livary glands. There are six salivary glands, three on each side, the parotid, submaxillary, and sublingual. The Parotid Gland is the largest of these conglo- merate glands; it derives its name from its proximity to the ear; it is exposed by dissecting off the integu- ments, and a dense fascia which covers and adheres to it; this fascia is continued from that of the neck, spreads over the gland, is closely connected to the cartilagi- nous part of the meatus auditorius, and sends numer- ous processes into the gland in every direction, serving to separate its lobules and to conduct the different ves- sels through its substance. The parotid gland is of an irregular square figure, and of a pale colour, filling the space between the ramus of the inferior maxilla and the ear, bounded above by the zygoma, below by a line drawn from the angle of the jaw to the mastoid process, posteriorly by the meatus auditorius, the mas- toid process and sterno mastoid muscle, anteriorly by the masseter muscle, the posterior third of whicli it overlaps. Its external surface is rather flat, but the internal is very irregular ; it sinks in behind the jaw, fills the deep excavation between this bone and the ear, rests against the styloid process of the temporal bone, the internal carotid' artery, jugular vein, and the large nerves connected with these vessels; it also fills the pos-

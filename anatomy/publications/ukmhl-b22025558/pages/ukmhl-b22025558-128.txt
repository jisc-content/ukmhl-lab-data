118 In the dissection of the forearm and hand, we meet with the branches of the brachial artery, with their ac- companying veins ; also branches of the brachial plexus of nerves^: the cutaneous veins have been already no- ticed. Ihe brachial artery, when it arrives at the head of the elbow, divides into its radial and ulnar branches. The radial artery descends from the elbow obliquely outwards, to the styloid process of the radius, passes over the outer side of the carpus, and then between the metacarpal bones of the thumb, and of the forefinger, where it divides into three branches, radialis indicis, magna pollicis, and palmaris profunda: the radial artery at first lies between the pronator teres and supinator longus ; afterwards between the supinator and flexor carpi radialis ; it then winds round the carpus, over the external lateral ligament, and beneath the extensor ten- dons of the thumb ; in the forearm it is only overlapped above by the supinator longus ; in the rest of its course it is superficial; it is accompanied by two veins, and by the radial branch of the musculo-spiral nerve, which lies to its outer side. The radial artery gives off, 1st, The recurrent branch, which ascends in front of the external condyle, to supply the muscles attached there, and to inosculate with the superior profunda; 2d, in its course down the forearm, several muscular branches; 3d, near the wrist, the superficialis volae, which passes to the small muscles of the thumb, and communicates with the superficial palmar artery â– , 4 th and 5th. branches to the fore and back part of the carpus: and between the thumb and index finger it divides into its three last branches; the magna pollicis subdivides, and supplies the sides of the thumb; the radialis indicis, in like man- ner, supplies the forefinger; and the palmaris profunda passes beneath all the flexor tendons across the four metacarpal bones, forms the deep palmar arch, and then joins a branch from the ulnar artery. The ulnar artery is larger than the radial: it descends obliquely inwards, beneath the superficial flexors and pronators, and lies on the flexor profundus; it passes over the an- nular ligament into the palm of the hand, and there di- vides into a su})erficial and deep branch : this vessel is covered above by several muscles, inferiorly it is super-

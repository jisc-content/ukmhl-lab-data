334 several small ganglions are enclosed, and to the aggre- gate of these the term cardiac ganglion is applied; su- periorly it receives the middle cardiac nerves from each side, also some filaments from the superior cardiac, par- ticularly on the left side, and also some from the inferior cardiac, particularly on the right side ; the greater portion of the right superior cardiac joins the middle cardiac before the latter arrives at the plexus, and the inferior is chiefly distributed on the fore-part of aorta to the anterior cardiac plexus; from the great cardiac plexus branches proceed in various directions, some pass backwards encircling the posterior coronary artery, and forming a plexus around it, and accompa- nying its branches into the substance of the heart, others pass forwards round the aorta, form the anterior cardiac plexus on it and on the right pulmonary artery, and vena cava ; from this plexus branches descend over the right auricle, accompany the anterior coronary artery, and form plexuses around it and its several branches ; from this ganglion also numerous nerves de- scend on either side along the pulmonary vessels and communicate with the pulmonary plexus; on the left side these branches encircle the ductus anteriosus. The sympathetic nerves in the thorax have twelve ganglions on each side, sometimes only eleven, the last cervical and first dorsal being then united; each of the thoracic ganglions is small and triangular, the base towards the spine, the apex externally ; covered by the pleura and placed on the heads of the ribs, the first ganglion is the largest; they all communicate by one or two branches, which ascend obliquely outwards, with the anterior or intercostal branch of the spinal nerves , from the base or anterior edge of each ganglion small branches pass forwards to the mediastinum, ramify on the aorta and adjacent vessels, and communicate with the pulmonary plexus. From the six inferior ganglions the splanchnic nerves arise; these are two in nutnber on each side, the greater and lesser or superior and infe- rior. The great Sj}lanchnic nerve arises by distinct roots from the sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, and tentli ganglions, these descend obliquely forwards and unite on the tenth dorsal vertebra into one cord, which enters

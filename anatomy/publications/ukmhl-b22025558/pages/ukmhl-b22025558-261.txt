body forwards on the toes as in progression ; to flex the 'nee joint, also to secure tlie articulation against dis- placement, by preventing the condyles of the femur slipping backwards off those of the'tibia. This large muse e IS superficial, a small portion of its internal Head is overlapped by the semi-membranosus ; its deep surface is more aponeurotic than its superficial; the ower angle ot the iiophteal space separates its two heads ; m this angle the popliteal vessels, the posterior tibia! nerve, and the plantaris muscle are contained; a bursa is p aced between each head of this muscle and the condyle of the femur, which it covers; the exter- nal head conceals the tendon of the popliteus; the internal covers the deep processes of the semi-membra- nosus tendon and an intervening bursa, also the inser- tion ot the poplitseus; the gastrocnemius covers the greatei part of the solasus, therefore, to examine the latter, detach the heads of the gastrocnemius from the condyles, and separate this muscle from the solteus to within two or three inches of the heel; the plantaris muscle is now also exposed. Plantaris arises fleshy from the back part of the femur above the external condyle, and from the pos- externa head of the gastrocnemius, and forms a small pjramidal fleshy belly, which descends obliquely in- wards, crosses the popliteal vessels, and ends in a flat tween the gastrocnemius and solmus; and when the tendons of these muscles are about to unite, that of the plantaris becomes superficial, it then descends aloncr the inner side ot the tendo Achillis to the heel, and is mer/er/ into the posterior part of the os calcis, a little anteriorto the tendo Achillis; it has also some con! nexion to the plantar fascia. Use, to extend the foot tn Â«iake tense the fascia, and o flex the knee; its origin is partly concealed by the external head of the gastrocnemius; its tendon also is at first covered by this muscle, but inferiorly it is su- perficial. This muscle is sometimes wantintr _ SoL^us, of an oval flattened figure, co.nsist- simo norly ol two heads, which are not so distinct Vrlni

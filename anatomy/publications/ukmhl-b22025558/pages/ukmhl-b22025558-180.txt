170 right and left iliac arteries. The abdominal aorta sends off the following branches: 1st, the two phrenic arteries; 2d, the coeliac axis ; 3d, the superior mesenteric artery; 4-th, the two renal arteries ; 5th, the spermatic arteries ; 6th, the inferior mesenteric artery ; also four of five pair of lumbar arteries from its posterior part; and lastly, from the angle of its division the middle sacral artery descends. The right and left iliac arteries descend obliquel}' out- wards and backwards ; that of the right side is the lon- ger of the two; opposite each ilio-sacral articulation each common iliac artery divides into the internal and external iliac. The external proceeds along the inner side of the psoas magnus, and passing beneath Poupart’s ligament, becomes the femoral artery; just above this ligament it sends off two branches, the epigastric and the circumflex ilii. The internal iliac artery descends into the pelvis, and gives off several branches, which shall be noticed afterwards in the dissection of that ca- vity. The veins in the abdomen correspond to the arte- ries ; each external iliac vein ascends along the inner side*of the artery of the same name, and near the sa- crum is joined by the internal iliac vein, which ascends from the pelvis; the union of these on each side form the common iliac veins; each of these ascends behind its accompanying artery, and opposite the right side of the fourth or fifth lumbar vertebra these veins unite and form the inferior or ascending vena cava; the left com- mon iliac vein is longer than the right, and passes be- hind the right iliac artery. The vena cava ascends along the right side of the aorta, and receives the spermatic, renal, and lumbar veins ; it lies, inferiorly, on the right psoas muscle, and on the right crus of the diaphragm ■ superiorly, it inclines forwards and to the right side, and enters the fissure in the liver; here it receives the venae cavm hepatic®; it then passes through the opening m the tendon of the diaphragm, and arrives at the righ auricle of the heart. On each side oi the abdominal aorta the sympathetic nerves may be seen; they pass from the thorax into the abdomen, beneath the true ligamentum arcuatum, and then descend between the c?us of the diaphragm and the psoas magnus on each side; in this course they form three or four oval gan-

330 SECTION III. DISSECTION OF THE GANGLIONS. In addition to the small ganglions already noticed in the description of the cerebral nerves, viz. the lenti- cular or ophthalmic, the spheno-palatine, or Meckelâ€™s, and the sub-maxillary, also the several ganglions on the spinal nerves, we find one continued chain of these bodies placed anterior to the vertebral column on either side of the median line; these ganglions, on each side, are all connected to each other, and resemble a knotted cord ; this cord receives the name of the sympathetic n6rv0* The Sympathetic Nerves, therefore, are two in number; they descend from the base of the cranium perpendicularly along the neck, placed on the rectus capitis and longus colli muscles, and behind the great vessels and nerves ; at the upper part of the chest each of these nerves is divided by the subclavian artery into several branches, which encircle that vessel and unite below it in the thorax; through this cavity they de- scend at first obliquely backwards and outwards along the heads of the ribs and covered by the pleura ; they then incline a little forwards and pass behind the true ligamentum arcuatum into the abdomen; through this region they descend obliquely outwards on the foie- part of the lumbar vertebrae and between the psoasand die crus of the diaphragm; they then sink into the pel- vis keeping close to the sacrum, and descend along the anterior surface of this bone obliquely inwards; near its inferior extremity, or on the first part of the cocep, these nerves unite and terminate m a small ganglion named ganglion impar. The superior extremity ot each sympathetic nerve is connected by seveial fila- ments to several of the cerebral nerves; some of these connexions have been improperly termed the origin of the sympathetic; in their course along the spinal co- lumn ea^ch nerve regularly pair of the spinal nerves, with each ot the ceivical

132 tonaeum; this fascia is connected to the internal lip of the ilium and to the whole length of Poupart’s liga- ment, as far as the third insertion, from which it is con- tinued behind the rectus to that of the opposite side; from these attachments, the fascia transversalis ascends between the peritonaeum and the transversalis muscle, as high as the diaphragm and as far back as the psoas magnus ; it is very strong and tense inferiorly for about an inch above Poupart’s ligament, but superiorly it is little more than condensed cellular membrane: this fascia serves to support the peritonaeum, particularly at the inferior part of the abdomen where the internal ob- lique and transversalis muscles are deficient; the sper- matic cord, or the round ligament always perforates this fascia about three quarters of an inch above Pou- part’s ligament, and about an inch and a half from the pubis ; this perforation is called the interned abdominal ring, and is situated about midway between the spine of the ilium and the symphisis pubis; it is not a distinct opening, for the edges are prolonged along the cord, and lost in its cellular covering. The interval between the internal and external abdominal rings is traversed by the spermatic cord, and is named the inguinal or spermatic canal, to the anatomy of which the student should particularly attend, as the disease of inguinal hernia is situated here, in the treatment of which a cor- rect knowledge of this region will be required. The spermatic or inguinal canal commences at the internal ring, and leads obliquely downwards, forwards, and in- wards to the external ring, where it terminates; this passage is bounded anteriorly by the tendon of the ex- ternal oblique and by the inferior fleshy margin of the internal oblique and transverse muscles, posterioi'ly b}' the transversalis fascia and by the conjoined tendons of the two last named muscles, inferiorly by Poupart’s ligament and its third insertion, superiorly this space is closed by the apposition of its opposite sides; in the male the spermatic cord and cremaster muscle, and in the female the round ligament of the womb passes through this canal, the obliquity or valve-like structure of which serves to protect the abdomen against a pro- trusion of its contents.

335 the abdomen either along with the aorta or separated from it by a fasciculus ot the diaphragm ; each nerve then expands into the semilunar ganglion. The lesser Splanchnic nerve arises by two roots from the tenth and eleventh ganglions ; these unite on the side of the last dorsal vertebra; this small nerve then enters the abdo- men thiough the crus of the diaphragm, communicates wath the preceding, and ends in the renal plexus. In the abdomen we find the semilunar and the lumbar ganglions of each side ; the semilunar ganglion of each side IS situated on the diaphragm, and partly on the aorta on either side of the coeliac axis, and above and behind the supra-renal capsule ; these are the largest ganglions on the sympathetic ; they communicate with each other by several filaments on which small gan- glions are placed ; this communication surrounds the cceliac axis, and is termed the solar plexus ; this plexus 13 situated behind the stomach, in front of the aorta and above the pancreas; from it numerous nerves pass off in various directions ; these nerves accompany the blood vessels and form plexuses around each, which are named according to their destination, hepatic, splenic and pstric; these plexuses communicate with the eighth pair; from the solar plexus branches descend in front 0. the aorta; these subdivide at the renal and mesenteric arteries, accompany these vessels, form plexuses around each, which are named accordinalv the renal, superior, and inferior mesenteric plexus'es into each ot these, branches from the lumbar ganglions enter. riie lesser splanchnic nerve enters tlie renal p exus; from each renal plexus descends the spermatic plexus, which in the male descends in the spermatic cord and supplies the testicle ; in the female it enters the pelvis and supplies the ovarium and uterus. From the inferior mesenteric plexus branches descend to the edge of the pekis, unite with others from the lumbar ganglions, and rorm a plexus around the internal iliac artery and its pelvic branches ; this is termed the hvpo gastric plexus ; it is joined by numerous filaments fVom nnd ganglions of the sympathetic and t communicates with the pelvic branches of the plexus.

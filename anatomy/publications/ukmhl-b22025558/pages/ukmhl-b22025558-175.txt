l65 tonvarcls and downwards ; in some persons it projects below the liver against the abdominal muscles; it is ge- nerally contiguous to the pylorus and to the colon ; the smaller extremity or neck of the gall bladder is directed upwards, backwards and inwards, is a little convoluted, and ends in the cystic duct, which is about an inch and a half long; this duct bends downwards and inwards, and joins the hepatic duct at an acute angle, the union of which forms, as was before mentioned, the ductus cho- ledochus. The gall bladder is closely united to the liver by the peritonaeum, which passes over it; also by cellular membrane and small blood-vessels; it is com- posed of a partial serous and a perfect cellular coat, and is lined by a mucous membrane ; the latter has a pecu- liar honey-comb-like appearance, and in the duct is dis- posed in a spiral lamina. This viscus serves as a reser- voir for the bile, when this fluid is not required in the intestinal canal. The bile is secreted in the liver, and flows down the hepatic duct, and if not required in the duodenum, or if obstructed in the ductus choledochus, it passes into the cystic duct to the gall bladder, where ir resides a longer or shorter time, during which period its watery part is absorbed : at the end of some time, when the bile is required to assist in digestion, it is forced out of the gall bladder, and then flows again along the same cjstic duct to the ductus choledochus, and so to the duodenum. The bile is not secreted in the gall bladder, nor can it possibly enter or leave this viscus by any other channel than through the cystic duct. The Spleen is situated in the lefthypochondrium, be- tween the stomach and the ribs, beneath the diaphragm, and above the kidney and the colon: it is connected to the diaphragm by the peritonseum, also to the stomach and pancreas by vessels and by the peritonaeum. The spleen is somewhat oval; convex towards the ribs, and concave towards the stomach ; on the latter surface there are several holes, and about the centre of it a de- pression or fissure for the entrance and exit of blood- vessels ; all this surface, however, is not concave, the part anterior to the vessels only being so, while the part posterior to them is convex ; the colour of the spleen is

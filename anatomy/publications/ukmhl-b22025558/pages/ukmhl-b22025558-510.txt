500 simple dislocations. A primary dislocation, either di- rectly backwards or diroctly forwards, is not likely to happen, as the strong attachments of the teres minor, supra and infra-spinati muscles to the greater tubercle of the humerus, and that of the sub-scapular to the lesser tubercle, respectively offer powerful resistance in either of these directions. It is plain then from the con- struction of this joint, that a dislocation downwards, where the head of the bone rests on the sternal costa of the scapula, between the subscapularis and long head of the triceps, is the most likely to occur; for the lower part of the capsular ligament being unsupported by muscles, is most weak ; and the action of the levator muscles of the shoulder, by rotating the head of the humerus from above down, will bring the head of the bone near the inferior edge of the glenoid cavit)', and thus place it in a situation most favourable for displace- ment, when violence is applied to the extended arm. There is but one circumstance in the construction of the joint which has a tendency to counteract the acci- dent, which is, that the glenoid cavity is of greater ex- tent from above down than across. DISLOCATION DOWNWARDS. When the humerus is dislocated downwards, the head of the bone is found resting on the sternal costa of the scapula, between the long head of the triceps and sub-scapularis. The lower portion of the capsu- lar ligament is ruptured, and sometimes the tendon of tlie sub-scapularis ; the tendons of the supra and infia- spinati muscles and of the teres minor are also sometimes lacerated. The anatomy of the sound joint would lead us to conclude that these latter muscles should be in- jured much more frequently than the former, but dis- sections of dislocated shoulder-joints have proved the contrary. Some of the fibres of the deltoid, pectorahs major, and coraco-brachialis are occasionally torn ; t le long tendon of the biceps usually remains unbroken. Independent of external violence, the elevating tRu^c es of the humerus, and of the whole arm, (if the elbow joint be fixed,) with the pectoralis major, latissimus âœ“

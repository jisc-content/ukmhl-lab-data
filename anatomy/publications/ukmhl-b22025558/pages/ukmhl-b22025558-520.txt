610 DIRECTIONS FOR MAKING DRIED PREPARATIONS OP ARTERIES. Although in every anatomical school competent persons are retained for the purpose of injecting arteries and veins; still the student may wish to do it for him- self, or he may be placed in such situations that he cannot command any kind ot assistance : to him, more particularly, the few remarks which we purpose making on the method of injecting and of preserving arterial preparations, may be considered applicable. Injections are of two kinds, coarse and fine; there are many descriptions of coarse injections; with the fine we have nothing to do, as it is used by anatomists only for the purpose of imitating the natural vascularity which membranes and other structures lose after death. Coarse injections may be employed either hot or cold, formerly the hot injection was the only one used, but now the cold one is veiy frequently employed. As much of the success of the injection depends on the state of the subject, great care should be observed in the choice; if possible a young and thin one should aN ways be employed, as the arteries in old subjects are so often ossified and inelastic, that we can never be cer- tain that they will not burst from the force employed, and extravasate the injection between the muscles and into the different cavities; another objection to the use of old subjects is, that the constant oozing of oily matter from preparations made of them renders them filthy, and almost useless, particularly in warm weather; how- ever some old subjects may be filled with the cold (or paint) injection, if care be taken not to use too much force. When the student has made up his mind to em- ploy the hot injection, it may be useful to him to follow a few rules. In the first place the pipe should be tied so firmly in the opening into the vessel, that there will be no possibility of its slipping out; secondly, the nozzle of the syringe should always be introduced into the pipe, for the purpose of exhausting the artery of air or coagulated blood ; this being done the stopcock should be imme- diately turned ; and lastly, particular care should be

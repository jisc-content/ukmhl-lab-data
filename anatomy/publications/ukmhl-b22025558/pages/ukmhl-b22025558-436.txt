4-26 the symphisis pubis is not so deep, the sciatic tubero- sities are directed more outwards, and the acetabula are more distant from each other; the male pelvis is deeper, narrower, and stronger. The dimensions of the male and female pelvis are given by Meckel as follows, Tom. 1. p. 473. In the Male. In the Female. Inches. Lines, Inches. Lines.

The ossa innominata are composed of two thin but compact laminae with an intervening diploe, the latter is nearly wanting inAhe iliac fossa where the bone is transparent, as well as in the cotyloid cavitj'. In the foetus each os innominatum is developed from three points of ossification, one in the iliac fossa, one in the sciatic tubercle, and one near the spine of the pubis; these three soon unite in the cotyloid cavity. Some years after birth the iliac crest is developed as a dis- tinct epiphysis, the sciatic tubercle and anterior inte- rior spine of the ilium are also covered by distinct plates of bone, and in some the angle of the pubis; in some females also, a plate of bone or epiphysis consti- tutes the spine of the pubis and occasionally grows so large and remains so moveable, as to resemble the ru- diments of a marsupial bone. In the foetus, the pelvis is very small and deep, and narrow transversely; the true and false are nearly in the same line, the acetabula are nearer the middle line and look more outwards, they are not beneath the pelvis as in the adult, hence the thigh bones in the infant cannot support or balance the weight of the trunk.

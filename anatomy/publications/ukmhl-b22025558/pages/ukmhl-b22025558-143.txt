133 frequently in the male than in the female sex, in conse- quence ot the spermatic cord and the inguinal rings in man being larger than ihe ligamentum teres or these openings in the female : there are two species of this disease, oblique and direct. Oblique inguinal hernia is the more common form ; in this case, the peritonasum or the hernial sac with its contents, protrude through the internal ring along the anterior part of tlie spermatic vessels to which it is connected by the surrounding cel- lular tissue and by the prolongation of the fascia trans- versalis from the edges of the opening ; this covering of the hernial sac is called the Jhscia propria of inguinal hernia. When the tumor has arrived at the lower edge of the transversalis and internal oblique it insinuates itself between the cremaster muscle and the vessels of the cord, along which it descends to the externt^l ring, where it is in general delayed for some time ; the form of this opening and the inter-columnar fascia preventing its free passage through it ; as the sac however de- scends towards the scrotum these inter-columnar fibres become closely united to the cremaster, and are gradu- ally elongated on the surface of the tumor. If the sac of an oblique inguinal hernia which has passed the ex- ternal ring be carefully dissected, it will be found covered by the following parts; beneath the integu- ments the superficial fascia, in general much thickened and divisible into several laminae, will be seen to sur- round the tumour; on dissecting offâ€™ this, the fibres of the cremaster, in general also thickened, will be ob- served spread on the forepart and sides of the sac, the intercolumnar bands from the external oblique tendon will be found closely connected to this muscle, and both will form a sort of capsule for the sac, suspending Jt towards the abdomen; if this covering be divided, the fascia propria will appear closely investing the tu- mour, and so adhering to it as to be separated with diffi- culty from it; this covering can often be divided into several layers, it presents, however, great difference in dffierent cases; beneath this, the hernial sac, or the 1 eritonaeum will be found, which also in cases of old hernia will be considerably thickened ; on opeiiim-- the hernial sac, its contents, cither omentum or intestine N

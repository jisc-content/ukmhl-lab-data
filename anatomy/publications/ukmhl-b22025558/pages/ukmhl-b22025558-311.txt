301 both it and the frontal bcdng immediately beneath tlie peiiosteum; previous to entering the oblique muscle Its size is somewhat increased. I HE Trigemini, or the fifth jiair, having formed the semilunar or gasserian ganglion, divides into three Haiiches, tlie ophthalmic, the superior and inferior max- iliaiy nerves. The Ophthalmic Nerve passes along the outer side of the cavernous sinus below the third and fourth, and above thesi.Kth; in this situation it receives some filaments from the sympathetic nerve ; as it approaches the foramen lacerum orbitale, it divides into three branches, the lachrymal, frontal, and nasal, which are situated with respect to the other nerves as above de- scribed. The lachrymal nerve, the smallest of the three, passes oraards and outwards to the lachrymal gland above the external rectus muscle and beneath the peiiosteum but gives no branches to this muscle; it is surrounded by fat and accompanied by thelachrymal artery^; it sends off, in this course, two small branches, one through the sphono-maxillary fissure to communicate with the su- jierior maxillary nerve, and the other through the malar bone to communicate with the facial nerve; near the gland the lachrymal nerve enlarges and sends four or five branches to its inferior surface, and it then terminates ill several fine soft filaments on the conjunctiva, linincr the superior palpebra and cellular membrane between tlie gland and malar bone. llhe frontal nerve enters the orbit, between the su- perior rectus and the periosteum, along with the fourth but inferior and external to it; it passes forwards in a kind of groove on the upper surface of the levator pal- pebrae muscle ; and near the superciliary arch it divides into two branches, an internal and external; the inter- nal or supra-ttochleator nerve, the smaller branch, runs forwards and inwards above the trochlea of the stipe nor oblique muscle, and is distributed to the corriia^ tor supercihi, orbicularis palpebrarum, and occipito- frontalis muscles, also to the integuments of the fore- ead and superior eyelid ; it communicates with the nasal nerve, and sends one or two small filaments into

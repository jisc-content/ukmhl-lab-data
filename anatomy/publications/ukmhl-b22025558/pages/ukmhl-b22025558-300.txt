290 CHAPTER II. dissection of the medulla spinalis. The spinal marrow is contained in a cavity or canal which is bounded by the bodies and processes of the vertebrae and by their connecting ligaments; this or- can, like the brain, is surrounded by three membranes, which are continuous with those in the cranium. Place the subject on the fore-part, remove the soft parts covering the spine, and with the skw of the spinous processes ot all the vertebrae close to articulating processes, then with the posterior arch of the spinal canal; a quantity of loose reddish cellular tissue intervenes between the bones an the dura mater, which membrane is loosely connected to them, and does not serve the office of periosteum as in the cranium ; it is more closely attached to the liga- ments and bones anteriorly than laterally or posteriorly. The dura mater of the spinal canal ,s ermed the thecrvertebralis; it is continued from the cranium through the foramen magnum, down the spinal canal a far as^the third lumbar vertebra, where it divides into ieveml processes, which are contioueJ ou the sacral nerves-^throughout this extent it regularly sends off a tubular process along each « its external surface is smooth and polished. ^ scissors divide this membrane along its whole lengt , S internal surface will be found lined by the reflected liver of the arachnoid or serous membran . \he arachnoid or the serous membrane in this reg o iiected to the pia mate , ^ I „ay be it"P^''=^betwe™ h^tw ids!lhencJmlned“^^^^ fowi^stbstSreS, denZ:L 7 ihl.

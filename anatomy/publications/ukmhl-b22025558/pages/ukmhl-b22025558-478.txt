468 small oval articulating surface for the clavicle; the lower edge gives attachment to the deltoid, its apex is I'ounded for tlie insertion of the triangular, or coraco- acromial ligament; above the spine is the siipraspinata fossa, which is wider behind than before, this is filled by the supraspinous muscle; the fossa infraspinata is larger, is convex above and concave and grooved inferiorly ; between this and the inferior costa is a raised surface extending from the inferior angle to the glenoid cavity; this surface is divided into two by an oblique line, the posterior portion is flat and somewhat square, and gives attachment to the teres major muscle, the anterior to the teres minor; into the ridge between these is inserted an aponeurosis common to these two mus- cles ; the superior or cervical costa or border of the scapula is the shortest and thinnest; at its forepart is a notch which is converted into a hole by ligament and sometimes by bone; it is traversed by the supra-scapular nerve, and sometimes by the vessels of that name, to this costa, the supraspinatus, subscapular, and omohyoid muscles are attached ; from the anterior part of this border in front of the notch arises the coracoid process, which is long and narrow, and directed at first upwards and forwards and then downwards, convex and rough above for the attachment of the coracoid and trapezoid ligaments, smooth and concave below, it overhangs the inner and upper part of the glenoid cavity, the pectora- lis minor is inserted into it anteriorly, the biceps and coraco-brachialis into its summit, and the triangular ligament into its external border. The base ot the scapula or the posterior or vertebral edge is nearer the spine above than below ; the spinati muscles adhere to its outer lip, the subscapular to its inner, and the rhomboid to its middle; about one-fourth from its upper extremity is a blunt projection formed by the smooth triangular root of the spine ; at the union ot the base and upper costa \% xhe superior posterior angle, which is embraced by the levator anguli muscle. The anterior or inferior or external or axillary costa is very thick, and inclines downwards and forwards, at its junction with the base it forms the iriferior angle, on which is a long flat surface which gives origin to the

252 âœ“ each other as those of the gastrocnemius ; the external is longer and larger than the internal, and arises from the back part of the head and from tlie superior third of the fibula, behind the peronaeus longus : the inter- nal head arises from the middle third of the tibia com- mencing below the obli(|ue insertion of the poplitseus ; the two heads are connected by a strong tendinous arch, beneath which pass the posterior tibial nerve and vessels; all the fibres descend' and form a large oval belly, which continues fleshy lower than the gas- torenemius; a tendon is formed first on its superficial surface, which is gradually united to that of the gas- trocnemius to form the tendo Achillis ; this strong ten- don is broad and thin above, narrow in the middle, and round and thick below, it is composed of strong vertical fibres which descend behind the os calcis, over a bursa covering a cartilaginous impression on that bone, and it is inserted into a rough surface below that. Use, to assist the gostrocnemius in extending the ankle ; this muscle is almost entirely concealed by the gastrocnemius; a little below the middle of the leg, however, it projects on each side of the tendon of the latter, and forms tlie lower calf of the leg; it covers the deep seated muscles, vessels, and nerves. Detach the solaeus from its origin, and the strong deep fascia of the leg is exposed ; this fascia is partly derived from tlie semi membranosus and poplitteus, and partly from the more superficial fascia of the leg; it adheres to the tibia and fibula, to the solaeus and to the deep muscles; inferiorly this fascia is strong, 1 and is connected to the sheaths of the tendons that pass behind the malleoli, and to the internal annular ligament of the ankle ; dissect of! this fascia and clean the four following muscles. PoPLiT^us, situated obliquely at the upper and back part of the leg, behind the knee, and above the other muscles in this region, flat and tiiangulai, a?/5eA' by a round tendon from a depression on the outer condyle, descends obliquely inwards and backwards, above the head of the fibula, and along the exteriial semi-lunar cartilage, to whicli it is connected by the synovial membrane of the knee, and by a few tendi-

368 wards round the inferior costa of the scapula, behind the long tendon of the triceps; and above the latis- simus and teres major muscles, it is distributed on the dorsum of the scapula to the infra-spinatus and teres minor muscles, and inosculates with the supra-scapular artery. The â€˜posterior circumjiex artery arises below the last, sometimes in common with it, it passes out of the axilla between the long tendon of the triceps and the humerus, turns round this bone between it and the deltoid muscle, to which last it sends numerous branches. The anterior circuniflex artery is smaller than the preceding, and arises either from it or from the axillary; it passes outwards round the anterior part of the hu- merus, beneath the deltoid, coraco-brachialis, and bi- ceps; to these muscles it sends its branches ; it also sends one long branch along the bicipital groove to the synovial membrane of the shoulder joint. The Brachial artery descends obliquely outwards to the bend of the elbow, where it divides into the radial and ulnar arteries; it is covered by the skin and bra- chial aponeurosis, and inferiorly by the fascia of the biceps, and the median basilic vein ; it lies on the inner side of the coraco-brachialis and biceps, and passes over the upper part of the triceps, the coraco-brachialis, and the brachiaeus anticus; it is accompanied by a vein on either side, also, by the median nerve, which above lies to its outer, and below to its inner side, it passes superficial to the artery about the middle of the arm ; in addition to several muscular branches it sends .off the superior and inferior profunda, and the anasto- motica. The superior profunda arises below the teres major, accompanies the musculo-spiral nerve obliquely down- wards and outwards, between the three heads of the triceps, and in the musculo-spiral groove of the humer- us ; it divides into two large branches, one descends in the* triceps to the olecranon, the other accompanies the radial nerve to the outer condyle, and communicates with the radial recurrent artery.

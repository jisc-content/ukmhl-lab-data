184 the posterior triangular division contains the lower ex- tremity of the rectum, surrounded by the cutaneous and deep sphincters, also on each side of this intestine a considerable quantity of fat filling up the space between the side of the rectum and the obturator internus muscle and fascia, which space is bounded superiorly, that is, separated from the pelvis by the levator ani muscle, and inferiorly is closed by the fascia and integuments, the fat is from two to three inches in depth ; when this mass is dissected out of the space which it fills, the le- vator ani muscle will be seen extended from the inter- nal surface of the pelvis to either side of the rectum, and to the coccyx, so as to form a partition between the pelvis and the perinseum.â€”First examine the mus- cles in the anterior part of the perinmum; the erector or compressor penis is most external, and lies on the crus penis; the accelerator ui inas extends along the middle of the perineum, attached to its fellow along the raphe, and covering the urethra; the transversalis perinffii connects the posterior extremities of these mus- cles. Immediately in front of the rectum, m the mul- dleline, and behind, but connected to the bulb ot the urethra, is a small, white, tendinous spot, coinposctl ot condensed cellular tendinous substance ; of the perinseal muscles are inserted; is theiefo e called the cevtral point of the perineum, or the common point of insertion to the muscles of the Erector, or Compressor Penis, long anti flat, narrow ateach extremity, broader in the ^ tendinous and fleshy from the inner surface ischii and from the insertion of the great oi infer o sacro-sciatic ligament, the fibres wards and inwards, adhering to the edges of the lam of the pubis and ischium, and covering the crus penis. The flLby fibres terminate in a tendinous expansioi^, whWi Llfnes forwards, upwards, ancl ou^ar^^ inserted into the fibrous membrane of the coi pus ca vernosum or crus penis. Use ; to draw down the pe- nis; it also contributes the erection or thsteiis.^^^^^^^ this orean by propelling the blood into it, and by the compilssion^of the veins against the bone preventing the Le return of this fluid through these vessels.

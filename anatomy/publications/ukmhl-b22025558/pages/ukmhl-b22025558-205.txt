195 fbrnier, and is inserted inferiorly into the great sciatic ligarnent, into the tuber ischii, and into the rami of the ischium and pubis, where it is continuous with the tiiangular ligament of the urethra, vvhicli ligament thus appears to be the continuation of the obturator fascia, from one side of the pelvis to the other. The vesical Jasciu covers and adheres to the internal surface of the levator ani, lying between it and the peritonaeum ; tliis i^cia descends anteriorly to the lower edge of the sym- physis pubis, and laterally to a level with a line carried rom this point round to the spine of the ischium ; from the pubes it is reflected on the upper surface of the pros- tate gland, and on the neck of the bladder, forming the anterior true ligaments of this organ ; laterally it is re- ectecl from the pelvis on the side of the prostate, and on the lower part of the side of the bladder, just above the outer edge of each vesicula seminalis, and thus it torrns the true lateral ligaments of the bladder; poste- j ^ vesical fascia becomes thin and cellular, is at- tached to the side of the rectum, and lost on the nerves and vessels passing into and out of the pelvis. The vesical fascia thus forms a pouch on each side of the bladder, which assists in closing the pelvis; it also n.xes the pelvic viscera, supports the peritonaium, and resists the pressure of the abdominal muscles and dia- phragm. This fascia is perforated by several blood- vessels. The anterior ligaments of the bladder are two in number; they arise, each, from the lower margin of the pubis by the side of the symphysis ; pass backwards and upwards on the upper surface of the prostate gland and expand on the anterior part of the bladder; many ot their fibres may be seen to become continuous with the muscular fibres of the bladder. A depression exists between these two ligaments, along which the dorsal veins or the penis pass from beneath the arch of the pubes to the side of the bladder in their course to the internal iliac veins, in which they terminate ; the pelvic fascia, however, is not deficient between these ligaments but IS continued from one to the other, so as to line this depression and cover the superior surface of these veins 1 he true lateral ligaments of the bladder arc, one on

514 be taken to remove all the cellular substance from the coats of the vessels; if this be not done, the preparation will always have a dirty appearance. The fattv matter IS likewise to be removed, but no muscle is to be taken away or pushed from its situation unless perfectly un- avoidable. The student should always remember that the utility of a dried preparation consists in its preserv- ing, as far as possible, the natural relation of parts ; on this account, the use of pieces of stick or other sub- stances to separate the muscles and exhibit the course of the vessels, unless absolutely necessary, is to be con- demned. One side of the subject ought to be appropri- ated to the exhibition of the superficial vessels, the other may be usedjfor the deep seated. When the dissection is completed, the extremity, or whatever portion of the body it may be, should be hung up in a dry and airy si- tuat.on (but not exposed to the sun) until the muscles acquire firmness, and no exudation appears on their surface.^ The preparation now fit for use, is to be brushed over with copal or mastich varnish, which makes the vessels more distinct, and materially assists in its future preservation.

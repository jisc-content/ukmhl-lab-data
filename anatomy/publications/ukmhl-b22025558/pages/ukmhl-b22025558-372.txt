3G2 cous membrane, and to inosculate with branches of the labial artery; between the pterygoid muscles it sends off, 3rd, the deep temporal branches, one pos- terior, the other anterior; these supply the muscle and ascend close to the bone; 4th, masseteric ; 5th, pie7-pgoid; 6th, buccal, to the buccinator mus- cle, the fat and integuments of the cheek; 7th, superior dental, which winds round the maxillary tuberosity and sends branches into the alveoli and to the gums; in the spheno-raaxillary fossa it gives off, 8th, infra-orbital, which passes along the canal of that name, is distributed to the muscles of the face, and communicates with the arteries of that region ; 9th, 7iasal passes inwards through the spheno-pala- tine hole, and is distributed to the mucous membrane on the spongy bones and on the septum ; 10th the su- perior palatine descends along the posterior palatine canal, and is distributed to the muscles and to the mu- cous membrane of the palate, principally to the hard palate; 11th the vidian; this is a small branch which ))asses backwards, and takes the course of the first part of the vidian nerve ; these terminating branches of the internal maxillary artery are entangled with the divi- sions of the superior maxillary nerve. The internal carotid artery ascends along the verte- bral column and the side of the pharynx from the cora- I'.ion carotid, ppslerior and externa! to the external ca- ) otid, behind the digastric and styloid muscles, internal to the jugular vein and anterior to the vagus and sym- ])athetic nerves, to the foramen cayoticum in the pe- trous bone ; it then bends tortuously forwards, upwards, and inwards, through the carotid canal, accompanied by the superior branches of the sympathetic, enters the cavernous sinus, through which it makes two remark- able turns internal to the sixth pair of nerves, and ariv- in" at the anterior clinoid process, it bends upwards and backwards, and a little outwards, and opposite the internal extremity of the fissure of Sylvius it divides into its three terminating hranches, it first gives off the ophthalmic artery : in the neck, and in the carotid canal, it sends small and unimportant branches to the sur- rounding parts.

iG branches of the external carotid; the nerves are branches of the 7th and 5th pair. The facial artery, which is a branch of the external carotid, is seen wind- ing round the side of the jaw, anterior to the masseter, and running in a contorted course towards the commis- sure of the lips, and thence ascending along the side of the nose to the internal canthus of the eye. in this course it sends off, numerous muscular branches, the coronary arteries of the lips, the nasal branches, and terminates in the angular branch, which communicates with the ophthalmic artery at the inner side of the orbit. The facial artery and its divisions are accom- panied by corresponding veins: the facial vein at the lower edge of the jaw, generally, but not always, di- vides into two branches, one, superficial, joins the external jugular vein, the other passing deeper in the neck, joins the internal jugular. The external carotid artery, which is seen ascending from the neck into the parotid gland, gives off numerous branches to its several lobules, and to the ear, and a little below the latter divides into the transversalis faciei, temporalis superfi- â€¢ cialis and raaxillaris interna. The transverse artery of the face crosses the masseter above, sometimes below the parotid duct, and divides into small muscular branches, some of which cfunmunicate with the facial and infraorbital arteries. The temporal artery ascends behind the articidation of the maxilla on the temporal aponeurosis, and soon divides into an anterior and pos- terior branch ; the former is directed towards the fore- head, supplies the integuments and muscles theie, and communicates with the frontal branches of the ophthal- mic artery; the posterior division of the temporal luns tortuously upwards and backwards, and divides into numerous branches, which supply the integuments and inosculate with the occipital and posterior auris arte- ries. The internal maxillary artery is the largest branch of the carotid ; it bends in beliind the neck of the lower jaw, between the bone and the internal late- ral ligament, then runs tortuously between the ptery- goid muscles, upwards, forwards, and inwards to the lower and back part of the orbit, where it sinks spheno-maxillary fossa; in this course it sends off the

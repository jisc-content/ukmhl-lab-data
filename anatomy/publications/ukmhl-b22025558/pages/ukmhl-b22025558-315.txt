305 tlie anterior palatine branches, and m here some ana- tomists describe a small ganglion (naso-palatine) to exist; this, however, can seldom be distinguished from the surrounding fat and vessels. The third or the pos- terior branch of INIeckelâ€™s ganglion is the vidian nerve; this passes backwards through the vidian canal above the internal pterygoid plate and sends some small fila- ments into the sphenoidal sinus ; it then perforates the cartilaginous substance that closes the I'oramen lace- rum anterius, enters the cranium, and divides into two branches, an inferior and superior; the inferior or carotid branch enters the cavernous sinus, and joins the plexus formed in this sinus around the artery by the ascending branches of the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic; the superior branch runs back- wards and outwards beneath the dura mater and gasse- rian ganglion in a groove on the petrous bone, enters the hiatus Fallopii in this bone, and becomes attached to theportio dura nerve, which it accompanies as far as the back part of the tympanum ; the vidian nerve then leaves Uie portlo dura, receives the name of corda tympani, and enters the tympanum a little below the pyramid; it now proceeds forwards between the lonf leg of the incus and the handle of the malleus ; to the latter it is firmly connected; it then escapes by the hole in the glenoid fissure along with the tendon of the laxa- tor tympani muscle; it then runs downwards, inwards, and forwards, joins the gustatory nerve, and continues attached to it as far as the submaxillary gland ; it now leaves the gustatory nerve and unites with some fila- ments from it in the submaxillary ganglion, which is situated near the posterior edge of the submaxillary gland, and from which a number of filaments proceed ; these form a plexus which supplies this gland. The superior maxillary nerve immediately after, and some- times previous to giving off the two descending branches which join the spheno-palatine ganglion, sends off the orbital branch, this ascends through the spheno-maxil- lary fissure and divides into two branches, the malar and temporal; the malar communicates with the la chr^mal nerve, and is distributed to the integumems D D 2

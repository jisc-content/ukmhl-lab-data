440 perior maxillary nerve; between the lesser and great wing is a long slit, the foramen lacerum orbitate, wide internally, narrow externally where the frontal bone sometimes assists in closing it, iftransmits the 3rd, -i'th, first branch of the 5th and the 6th pair of nerves from the cranium to the orbit: from the angle between the body and ala, the 'pterygoid plate descends perpendicu- larly, internally it bounds the posterior nans, external- ly the external pterygoid muscle is attached to it, ante- riorly the palate bone is connected to it, posteriorly it is hollowed into the pterygoid fossa, which lodges the inter- nal pterygoid muscle, and in a small depression internal to this the iensoxpalati muscle; this fossa thus divides this process into two plates, the external is broad and rough, the internal is longer and narrower, and ends in the ha- mulnr process, a small delicate hook, convex inwards, concave outwards, and covered by a bursa, round this the tendon of the tensor palati muscle turns; in the in- ferior notch between these plates the palate bone is re- ceived ; above the internal pterygoid plate is the vidian hole or canal, this opens anteriorly on the inner side of the foramen rotundum, into the spheno-maxillary fossa, and posteriorly into the foramen lacerum anterius, it transmits the vidian nerve and vessels. The structure of the sphenoid bone is very compact, except the body which is cellular; the latter about 10 years of age underoges the process of absorption, whereby the cavi- ties called the sphenoid sinuses are formed ; these open into the upper and back part of the nose; in front of them in the adult is a small curved plate of bone, the sphenoidal turbinated bone, it is of a pyramidal form, the base anteriorly connected to the posterior sethmoid cells, the apex posteriorly, and joined to the fore-part of the sinus, it lies above the spheno-pnlatine foramen, a hole which is below the body of the sphenoid, and between the orbital processes of the palate bone ; this hole leads from the nose to the spheno-maxillary space; these superior spongy bones are wanting in the child and sometimes in the adult. The sphenoid is articu- lated to the 7 bones of the cranium and to 5 of the face, viz., the two malar, two palate, and the vomer, and in some cases to the superior maxillary by the pte- rygoid plates, the palate bones however in general in-

<233 nous fibres; becomes broad and flesiiy, and is i/isertec/ into a flat triangular surface, which occupies' the su- perior fifth of tlie posterior surface of the tibia. Use, to bend the knee, and when bent, to twist the foot and tees inwards; it may also assist when the limb is extended m rotating the knee outwards ; it supports tlie external semi-lunar cartilage, and moves it sli<^htly, sc as to adapt Its situation to the external condyle of the temur, m the rotatory motions of the joint; the pophtteus is covered by the gastrocnemius and plantaris, a so y the external lateral ligament, the popliteal nerve an vessels ; it is superior to the sol$us, and passes over tlie tibio-fibular articulation and the back part of the tibia; it 13 nearly parallel to the upper part of the pJantaris; the tendon is nearly surrounded by the syno- via membrane of the knee, it lies however external to tlie cavity of the joint. Flexor Digitorum Perforans, broader in the centre than at either end, arises fleshy from the poste- rior flat surface of the tibia, commencing below the poplitaeus and extending to within two or three inches ot tlie ankle, also from the fascia and inter-muscular septa ; the fibres descend obliquely inwards to a tendon which passes behind the internal malleolus, in a groove in the tibia which is lubricated by a bursa, and in which It 1= confined along with the tendon of the tibialis pos- icus by the internal annular ligament, separated, hovv- ver, from that tendon by a ligamentous septum, each tendon also has a distinct synovial sac: this tendon then turns forwards and a little outwards into the sole of the foot, sti I confined in a bony groove, first in the astragalus, and then in the os calcis; in the sole of the oot It hes beneath the tendon of the flexor pollicis, and IS connected to it by a tendinous slip ; about the centre ot this region it expands and receives the insertion of the accessory muscle, it then divides into four tendons £ F Ihel'l fibrous sheath tm f ^ by synovtal membrane ; this sheath con- and ontiin-'*" of the second phalanx, i-ontains also the corresponding tendon of the exor digitorum brevis ; opposite the base of the second

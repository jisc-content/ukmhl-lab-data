321 flexors; at tlie pronator quadratus it divides into two branches, one to supply that muscle, the other traverses t e inter-osseous space, and is lost on the dorsum of the carpus and metacarpus: a little above the wrist, the median nerve gives off a superficial branch, which passes over the annular ligament, and is lost in the integuments; in the palm of the hand, the median neive divides into five digital branches, the two first pass one along either side of the thumb, the third goes to the radial side of the index finger, the fourth supp les the opposed sides of the index finger, the ourt 1 supplies the opposed sides of the index and middle nger and the fifth, which is joined by a small branch trom the ulnar nerve, supplies the opposed sides of the middle and ring fingers; these digital branches in the palm of the hand are superficial to the tendons, and form an arch nearly parallel to that formed by the ulnar artery, the branches of the latter and the neives then run together to the extremity of each finger; in this course they supply the lumbricales, t e integuments of the hand and fingers, and near the last phalanx of each the nerves enlarge and be- and soft, and divide into numerous fine branches, which are lost in the papillm of the cutis. mnar arises from the lower part of the plexus, descends obliquely backwards along the biceps, and behind the elbow joint, through the groove Ltween the inner condyle and the olecranon process; it then descends along the ulnar side nulil over the an. nalm f pisiform form, ends in the dppn T ’ 'O branches, a superficial and a Ti' i u superficial, and gives off forp *^'‘?"ohes to the triceps and to the skin ; in the "od between the laX thph^?"'*"'^" '?'*'’'®’ these muscles, particu- the wHst ,1 several filaments ; a little above bnnpl I • ^ '^os oft the dorsalis carpi ulnaris, a large h^nd 1 the back of the lostin branches which are ost in the integuments of that region and of the three oner fingers. Of the terminating branches of the ulnar nerve, the superficial is the larger, it divides into

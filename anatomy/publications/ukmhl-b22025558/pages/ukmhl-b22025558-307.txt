297 liistribiitecl to tlie inferior surface of the cerebellum. Ihe bastilar artery ascends along the median groove in the pons, and at its superior edge divides into four branches, two for each side, viz. the superior cerebel- < lar artery and the posterior cerebral; these are distri- buted as their names imply: the posterior cerebral ar- tery of each side is joined by the posterior branch of each internal carotid ; this communication completes the circle of W illis. Each internal carotid artery winds obliquely forwards, upwards, and inwards, through the tortuous canal in ilie temporal bone, and through the cavernous sinus ; beneath the anterior clinoid process it perforates the dura mater, and rises perpendicularly to the base of the brain between the second and third nerves, and then divides into three branches, the ante- rior, middle, and posterior; before it thus divides it gives off, first, small branches to the cavernous sinus and to the dura mater, and next the ophthalmic artery which enters the orbit through the optic hole and is dis- tributed to the eye and its appendages. The anterior branch of the carotid is also named the anterior cere- bral artery, or the artery of the corpus callosum ; this passes forwards and inwards, and is joined to the cor- responding artery of the opposite side by a short branch, (the anterior communicating artery,) it then ascends and runs along the upper surface of tlie corpus callosum, distributing its branches to the inner surface of each hemisphere; the middle branch of the carotid is very large, it passes upwards and outwards deep in tlie fissure of Sylvius, and is distributed to the anterior and middle lobes of the cerebrum ; the posterior branch of the caiotid is named the posterior commu- nicating artery ; it is small, passes backwards, and joins the posterior cerebral artery ; this forms the side of the circle of Willis.â€”(Sec Anatomy of Vascular System.) The vessels of the brain are accompanied by numerous fine filaments of the sympathetic nerve, these pass into its_ substance and supply its intimate structure. The veins of the brain empty themselves into the sinuses which have been already described ; the principal veins are on tlie superior surface of the brain, whereas the large arteries are below.

38 SECTION III. DISSECTION OF THE PHARYNX. To obtain a vietv of the muscles of the pharynx and palate, the student may now make the following dissec- tion : divide the trachea and oesophagus in the lower part of the neck; detach them from the vertebrce, to which they are loosely connected ; draw forward these organs, together with the vessels and nerves on either side ; place the saw flat on the bodies of the vertebi'cE ; insiiiuate its edge, between the styloid and mastoid processes on each side, and make a vertical section of the head; we have thus the face and anterior part of the cranium separated from the vertebral column ; or, should it he desirable to preserve the cranium, we may separate the occipital bone from the atlas, and then re- move from the subject the whole head, together with the organs we wish to examine; distend the pharynx with hair or tow, and remove some of the loose cellular tissue connected to it, The^/mn/wx is a large, muscular, and membranous bag, extending from the base of the ci-anium to the 4th or 5th cervical vertebra, where it ends in the oesopha- gus ; it is placed behind the nose, mouth and larynx; is somewhat of a,n oval form, the largest part being opposite the os hyoides, and the smaller extremity joining the (Esophagus, The pharynx is attached supe- riorly and posteriorly to the cuneiform process, by an aponeurosis, which is very strong in the middle line, laterally by a thinper aponeurosis to the petrous bone, and anteriorly, by fleshy fibres to the internal pterj'- goid plate and hamular process, and to the posterior part of the mylo-byoid ridge of the lower maxilla;â€”the pharynx is connected posteriorly to the vertebrre and to the deep muscles of the neck by loose reticular membrane; anteriorly it is attached by mucous mem- brane and muscular fibres to the cornua of the os hyo- ides and thyroid cartilage, and to the sides of the cri- coid, behind which the pharynx abruptly contracts and ends in the oesophagus: on either side of the pharynx, and loosely connected to it, is the sheath of the carotid

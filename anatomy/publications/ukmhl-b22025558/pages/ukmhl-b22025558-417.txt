They support and protect the soft parts, give the general form to the whole body as well as to its different parts, they also serve as the pas, sive organs of locomotion, affording a series of levers by means of which the muscles effect the various motions and actions of the body. When all the bones are connected by their ligaments, the collection is called a natural skeleton ; when united by art, an artificial skeleton. The skeleton is divided into the trunk and extremities. The trunk consists of the middle part and two extre- mities ; the middle of the trunk is formed by the verte- bral column and the chest; the upper extremity of the trunk is the head, the lower the pelvis.

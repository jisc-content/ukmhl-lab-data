441 tervene; the processes enumerated are 27, viz., 5 cli- noid, 1 aethmoidal, 2 lesser wings, 1 vomer, 2 spongy or triangular, 2 great wings, 2 temporal, 2 orbital, 2 spinous, 2 st)'loid, 4 pterygoid, and 2 hamular: the for- amina are 14 propfer and 8 common; the proper are, 2 optic, 2 lacerated orbital, 2 round, 2 oval, 2 spinal, 2 vidian and the 2 sinuses : the common are, 2 foramina lacera antica basis cranii, 2 spheno-maxillary fissures, one in each orbit bounded by the orbital plates of the sphe- noid, malar, maxillaiy and palate bones, 2 spheno- palatine, and 2 posterior palatine canals between the pterygoid processes and the superior maxillary tubero- sities. The bones of the cranium are connected to each other by suture, that is, the edge of each is serrated or cut into irregular teeth like processes, these indi- gitate or lock into each other, so as to unite the two edges in a very strong anti motionless manner, the indentations are irregular and oblique in very thick bones, but where the edges are thin, the su- ture is more straight and regular, they are more dis- tinct in the young than in the old, and on the outer than the inner surface of the cranium; there are seven sutures noticed by most anatomists, some however unnecessarily enumerate a greater number, the sphenoidal, aethmoidal, coronal, sagittal, lambdoid and two squamous. The sphenoidal suture is very ex- tensive, it follows the irregular edge of the sphenoid bone, and connects it to the occipital, the temporal, inferior angle of the parietal, the frontal, and the $thmoid. The cethmoidal suture in like manner en- circles the aethmoid bone and connects it to the frontal. "Yhe frontal or coronal suture proceeds from the upper extremity of the sphenoidal about an inch behind the external angle of the os frontis, asc^ju^, vertically inclining a little backwards, and '’“-v scends to the same point on the opposite sid^5^'con-' > nects the frontal and parietal bones in theJri^hner be* s V'’’ . fore explained.

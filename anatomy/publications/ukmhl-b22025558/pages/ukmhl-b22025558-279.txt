269 in the inferior angle of the parietal; it then descends inwards along the mastoid portion of the temporal bone, and again indenting the occipital, it turns forwards, and passing through the toraraen lacerum posterius, ends in the internal jugular vein ; each lateral sinus receives several small veins from the posterior lobes of the cere- brum and from the cerebellum ; these enter the sinus from without inwards, contrary to the current in the sinus; through each of these sinuses all the blood is re- turned from the cranium to the general system ; there are seldom any transverse bands orglandulae Pacchioni in these sinuses. The following sinuses are situated on the base ot the cranium. The cavernous si)ius on each side extends from the anterior clinoid process to the point of the petrous bone along the side of the body of the sphenoid; the dura mater in this region divides into two layers, one very thin adheres- to the irregular bony surface which bounds this cavity, the other much more dense is reflected over this space, and contains between its laminae the third and fourth nerve, and the first part of the fifth , the ophthalmic vein opens into the fore- part of this sinus, and the tvvo petrosal sinuses lead from it posteriorly to the lateral sinus; this sinus is in- tersected by tendinous bands, and presents rather a cel- lular or spongy appearance like the corpus cavernosum • penis; the internal carotid artery and the sixth or ah- ducens nerve pass through the cavity of this sinus, also several small branches from the sympathetic; the ve- nous membrane, however, is reflected around each, so as to separate them from the blood ; the cavernous sinuses communicate through the following; the circular Mnus consists of two small veins, which lead from one oavernous sinus to the other, the anterior is beneath the optic commissure, and before the pituitary gland ■ tile posterior is behind and rather below that body! petrosal sinuses are four in number, two on each fiide, the superior and inferior; they each lead from the cavernous sinuses backwards, the former along the tipper edge of the petrous bone, to the lateral sinuses opposite the inferior angle of the parietal bone; the in- erior petrous sinus leads downwards and backwards over the biuure between the petrous and occipital A A 2

320 liquely outwards, through the fibres of the coraco- brachialis, and between the brachieeus anticus and the biceps, it then descends along the outer border of the latter to the bend of the elbow, pierces the aponeurosis, becomes cutaneous, and descends along the radial side of the fore.arm to the wrist; in the arm this nerve gives muscular branches to the coraco brachialis, biceps, and brachiseus anticus, in the latter muscle it frequently communicates with the median nerve. At the elbow this nerve is situated between the biceps and supinator longus, and behind the cephalic vein, along the fore-arm it accompanies this vein, and is often superficial^ to it ; near the wrist this nerve divides into an anterior and posterior branch, the former passes to the ball of the thumb and palm of the hand, the latter to its dorsum. Median or brachial nerve is the largest branch of the plexus, it generally arises by two roots, a small ex- ternal one, which is in common with the external cu- taneous from the upper part of the plexus, and a large internal one from the lower division ot the plexus ; the brachial artery in general separates these two roots, which soon unite into one thick cord ; it descends ob- liquely outwards along the inner edge of the biceps, as far as the bend of the elbow, and in this part of its course it is covered only by the skin and fascia, situated rather to the outer side of the artery above, crossing over it about the middle of the arm, and to its ulnar side below; at the bend of the elbow it passes deep be- tween the supinator longus and pronator teres, and on the brachiseus anticus, perforates the pronator and then descends along the middle of the fore-arm, between the superficial and deep flexors, passes beneath the annular ligament of the carpus, where its size is increased, and terminates in the palm of the hand by dividing into five branches. In the arm the median nerve gives but few branches, these are small and unimportant; in the fore-arm it sends several considerable branches to the superficial and deep pronators and flexors, but not to the supinators, a little below the elbow it also gives off the anterior inter-osseal nerve, this accompanies the artery of the same name, along the anterior s^Jace of the inter-osseous membrane, and supplies the deep

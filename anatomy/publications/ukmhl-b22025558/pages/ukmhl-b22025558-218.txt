208 forms a fold, the fraenum preputii; the prepuce, there- fore, is only a fold of the common integument, the sides of which are connected together by very loose cellular tissue; this fold is expanded when the prepuce is drawn back, or when the penis becomes distended; the inner side of the prepuce is of more delicate tex- ture than the external, and that portion of it which is continued over the glans is still more delicate than either. Beneath the skin, around the corona glandis, are a number of small sebaceous glands, glandulae odo- riferae or Tysoni. The superficial fascia which covers the penis is continued from that of the abdomen, and extends around the penis as far as the corona glandis; it is thick and strong posteriorly, where it is reflected from the linea alba on the penis, so as to form the su- jierficial suspensory ligament of the latter; anteriorly it is loose and delicate. Beneath these coverings the penis is found to consist of two long cylindrical bodies, termed the crura or corpora cavernosa penis; each of these is composed of a strong, elastic, tendinous, and fibrous substance, forming a sort of tube, which is filled with a soft cellular tissue, through which a considerable artery, and several small tortuous veins, run from one end to the other. Each crus penis commences narrovv in front of the tuber ischii, and adheres to the rami of the ischium and pubis, as far forwards as the sym- physis; anterior to this the two crura become insepa- rably united, and continue so as far as the corona o-landis; here each crus ends in an obtuse point, oyer which the glans penis, which is the expanded extremity of the corpus spongiosum urethrae, is folded; the tw'o crura are attached to the symphysis pubis by the true suspensory ligawent, which is very strong, and of a tn angular figure ; it arises from the symphysis, and is in- serted into each crus; it consists of two laminae, be- tween which the dorsal vessels and nerves of the perns pass. The crura penis are separated from each other by an imperfect tendinous septum, composed of paral- lel fibres, with such intervals between them that the cavity of one crus communicates with, and can be in- jected from that of the other; this septum is named â€™p6ciin^or))\c% The crura penis are soniewiiat conica ,

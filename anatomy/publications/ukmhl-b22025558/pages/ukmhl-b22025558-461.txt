451 lip, external to which and looking backwards is the oval oblique opening of the dental canal, called the mental hole, through which a vessel and nerve of the same name pass ; posteriorly the body of the bone is concave, and lined above by the mucous membrane, in the middle it presents in the line of the symphisis, a chain of eminences, to the superior of which the frmnum linguae adheres, to the middle the genio-hyo-glossi, and to the inferior the genio-hyoidoei muscles ; above and on each side of these are depressions for the sublingual glands and at the lower border are two depressions for the digastric muscles. The sides of the maxilla have a direction backwards and outwards, on their outer surface is an oblique line which passes backw'ards and upwards to the anterior edge of the coronoid process, it gives at- tachment before to the platisma and depressor anguli oris, and behind to the buccinator muscles ; internally also is an oblique line, parallel to, but more prominent than the external, to this is attached the mylo-hyoid muscle anteriorly, and the superior constrictor of the pharynx posteriorly; beneath this line is a slight groove which contains the mylo hyoid nerve, and below this an oblong depression for the submaxillary gland; the lower edge or base of the jaw is rounded, thick before, thin behind, and grooved opposite the second molar tooth tor the facial artery; the upper or alveolar edge is broad posteriorly and bent a little inwards; it has usually IG alveoli, which, as in the upper jaw, vary in form ac- cording to that of the teeth. The angle of the jaw is more or less obtuse, and often bent a little outwards ; the niasseter adheres to it externally, the internal pteri- goid internally, and the stylo-maxillary ligament to the border of it. The ramus ascends a little backwards, is thick and round posteriorly and is enveloped by the parotid gland, externally it is covered by the masseter, internally it presents a deep groove which leads to a large hole, the inforior dental or maxillary; this is situ- ated near the centre of the ramus, and is protected in- ternally by a prominent spine into which the internal lateral ligament is inserted, a slight groove leads from this hole to the rnylo-hyoid muscle; the dental hole jeads into a canal which traverses the side of the bone

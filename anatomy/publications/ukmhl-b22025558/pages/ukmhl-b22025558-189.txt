179 Quadratus Lumborum, is a thick, flat muscJe, between the anterior and middle layers of the trans- versalis abdominis tendon, posterior to the psoas, the kidney and the diaphragm; and anterior to the sacro- lumbalis ; it arises tendinous from the posterior fourth of the spine of the ilium, and from the iiio-lumbar liga- ment; the fibres ascend obliquely inwards, and are m- seried into the extremity of the transverse processes of the four first lumbar vertebrae, and of the last dorsal; also into the internal surface of the posterior half of the last rib. Use; to bend the spine to one side, to de- press the last rib, thus assisting in expiration; when both muscles act, they support the spinal column in the perpendicular direction. Psoas Parvus arises fleshy from the side of the last dorsal and first lumbar vertebra, ends in a long flat ten- don, which descends on the inner side of the Psoas magnus, and is inserted hroad and thin into the linea ileo-pectinrea, or brim of the pelvis, also into the fascia iliaca and fascia lata, behind the femoral vessels Lse; it assists in bending the body forwards, or in rais- ing the pelvis; it also makes tense the crusal arch, in consequence of its attachment to the fascia lata. This muscle is often wanting ; when present, it is situated internal and anterior to the psoas magnus, and is partly concealed by the diaphragm, the renal vessels, the pe’- ritonsum, and at its insertion by the external iliac artery. Psoas Magnus, long, round and thick in the cen- tre, small at its extremities, fleshy at its superior, ten- dinous at its inferior; it extends along the sides of the lumbar vertebrae, of the brim of the pelvis, and the an- terior and inner part of the thigh ; it arises fleshy from the side of the body of the two last dorsal, and from the bodies and transverse processes of all the lumbar vertebrae, also from the intervertebral ligaments; the fibres all descend, at first vertically, afterwards' ob- liquely outwards, along the brim of the pelvis, and beneath Poupart’s ligament; the muscle then becomes tendinous, and descends obliquely inwards and back- wards, and is inserted tendinous into the back part of the lesser trochanter, also fleshy into a ridge below

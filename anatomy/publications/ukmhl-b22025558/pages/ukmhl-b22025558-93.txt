83 muscles are covered by the trapezius, latissimus, and integuments, and conceal part of the serrati postici muscles. Levator AycuLi Scapula, long, and somewhat round, placed at the upper and posterior part of the side of the neck, arises by four or five tendons from the posterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the four or five superior cervical vertebrae ; these soon ter- minate in a fleshy bell}^, which descends obliquely out- wards and backwards, and is inserted into tlie base of the scapula, between the spine and superior angle; its use is to elevate the whole scapula, if assisted by the trapezius, or to elevate the superior angle alone, and to rotate the scapula so as to depress the acromion, thus co-operating with the lesser pectoral muscle; it is covered by the trapezius; a small portion may be seen superiorly between this and the sterno-mastoid muscle: the tendinous origins have those of the splenius colli behind them, and of the scaleni and rectus capitis an- ticus major before them. Divide and reflect the rhom- boid muscles ; beneath these a quantity of loose cellular membrane is placed, between them and the serratus magnus, to the posterior view of which muscle the student should now attend; he may therefore again pe- ruse the account given of that muscle, (see page 55.) Serratus Posticus Superior, arises by a thin aponeurosis Irom'the ligamentum nuchas, and from two or three dorsal spines, forms a thin fleshy belly, which ends in three fleshy slips, which are inserted into the 2d, .Sd, and 4th ribs external to their angles. Use, to expand the tliorax by elevating the ribs and drawing them outwards. This muscle is covered by the trape- zius and rhomboid ; it lies on the splenius and the deep layer of muscles ; an aponeurosis is continued from it to the inferior serratus. Serratus Posticus Inferior, arises by a thin tendinous expansion, which is connected through tlie lumbar fascia to the two last dorsal and two u])per lum- bar spines ; it forms a thin fleshy expansion, which divides into three or four fasciculi, which are inserted into the lower edge of the four inferior ribs anterior to their angles. Use, by depressing the ribs it assists

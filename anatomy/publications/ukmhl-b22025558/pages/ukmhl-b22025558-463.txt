453 but very long; the grinders or molares are 10 in each jaw, the crown of these are broad and irregular, the roots are more or less divided; the upper grinders are stronger than the lower, the axis of the former are di- rected outwards, in the latter it is vertical; the two first molar are called hicuspidati, and are smaller than the canine; they have only two tubercles on the crown and the fang is single but sometimes it is double, the posJ terior grinders are the true molar or midticuspidati, these are large; the crown has four or five tubercles, the root has three or four divisions, each is perforated by a small hole. The teeth are composed of a very compact bone or ivory, less brittle than the enamel; the latter only covers the crown as far as the neck; the ivory has no cells in it, its fracture is silky; iri addition to the component parts of bone it also contains some tiuiite of lime ; it possesses the power of resisting the action of the air a long time; the enamel is very white, and so hard as to strike fire with steel; it is composed of fibres which are perpendicular to the surface of the crown, it is thicker where the teeth are exposed to much friction, it does not contain any vessels or nerves and is not regenerated when once destroyed; each root is perforated with a small hole which leads into the ca- vity in the crown; this cavity contains a pulp which is very vascular and nervous. ihe boneÂ» of the face are connected by sutures in the same manner as those of the cranium, it is unneces- sary to describe these individually, as they are all named' trom the particular bones they unite. The facial bones, in addition to forming the general outline of the face, also bound several regions, namely, the nose, orbits, palate, temporal, zygomatic and spheno-maxillary fossae. The bones entering into the nose have been already mentioned in the description of the organs of sense. 1 he Orbits are of a pyramidal figure, the base looking outwards and forwards, the apex backwards and in- wards: 7 bones enter into the parietes of each, the fron- tal, sphenoid, lachrymal, maxillary, palate, and malar; the upper wall or the roof of each orbit is formed by the frontal and the lesser wing of the sphenoid, it is concave, and presents the optic hole posteriorly and

364 The posterior communicaling artery arises from tlie carotid, opposite the ophthalmic; passes backwards and inwards, external to the corpora mamillaria, and joins the posterior cerebral artery; this artery forms the lateral part of the circle of Willis ; it sends several branches to the surrounding pia mater. The anterior cerebral artery, or arteria callosa, passes forwards and inwards above the optic nerve; anasto- moses with the opposite, by a short transverse branch, (the anterior communicating artery,) it then bends up- wards and backwards round the corpus callosum, on which it terminates by dividing into branches for the corresponding hemisphere of the cerebrum. The middle cerebral artery, very large, passes out- wards in the fissure of Sylvius, and divides into two tortuous branches, which supply the anterior and mid- dle lobes of the cerebrum. (See page 296.) The subclavian arteries; the right arises from the arteria innominata, and proceeds nearly transversely outwards, between the scaleni muscles, then obliquely downwards and outwards behind the clavicle; it is covered at first by the sterno-mastoid, hyoid, and thyroid muscles ; by the internal jugular vein, the va- gus,. and branches of the sympathetic nerve ; next, by the phrenic nerve and anterior scalenus muscle, and externally only by the skin, platysma, and fascia; it first passes over the recurrent nerve, the longus colli mus- cle, and sympathetic nerve ; next, the pleura and mid- dle scalenus muscle, and lastly, the first rib. The left subclavian arises from the posterior part of the arch of the aorta, ascends nearly vertically out of the chest; then turns outwâ€™ards and downwards between the scaleni muscles, and over the first rib ; in the chest this artery lies very deep, and is covered by the pleura and the lung, also by the vena innominata, the vagus, the sternum, and the muscles attached to it; it lies near the vertebrae, along the side of the oesophagus and thoracic duct; in the rest of its course, its relations are similar to those of the right; each sends off the follow- ing branches, vertebral, thyroid axis, internal mam- mary, superior intercostal and deep cervical.

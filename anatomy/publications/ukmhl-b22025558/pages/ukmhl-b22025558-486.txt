476 externally it joins the trapezoid, and internally the unciform ; both anteriorly and posteriorly it gives at- tachment to the ligaments. The unciform bone is next in size to the os mag- num; it is situated at the lower and inner part of the carpus, is rather wedge-shaped, the base below, articu- lated w'ith the 4th and 5th metacarpal bones; its upper surface is narrow, and meets the semilunar bone; its external side joins the magnum, its internal the cunei- form ; its posterior surface is rough for ligaments; from its anterior projects a small hooked process, curved out- wards for the attachment of the annular ligament and some of the muscles of the little finger. All the bones of the carpus, like those of the tarsus, are composed of a loose spongy vascular tissue, invested by a thin com- pact lamina; they are developed each from a single point of ossification, except the unciform, which has two ; the pisiform is the latest to ossify. The metacarpal bones belong to the class of long bones; they are 5 in number, are placed nearly parallel to each other, except the first, which is on a plane an- terior to the others ; the 1st is thick and short, the 3rd is the longest. They are all concave on the palmar surface, convex on the dorsal, and large at each extre- mity ; the posterior end is of an irregular figure; the anterior presents a round head; i\\e palmar surface of each is narrow, and presents a median prominent line; the posterior surface of the 1st is convex, but on the 2nd, 3rd and 4th; it presents a prominent longitudinal line, which bifurcates and forms the sides of a flat triangular surface, extending for near two-thirds of their length; into their edges the interosssei muscles are inserted ; the dorsal surface of the 5th is divided by an oblique line diagonally, the outer portion is concave, and lodges the fourth interosseous muscle, the inner convex and broad, and covered by the extensor tendon of the little finger. The carpal end or base of the 1st is concave from before backwards, and convex transversely, to ar- ticulate with the trapezium ; the base of the 2nd is con- cave, and articulates with the trapezoides, and presents externally a small smooth surface for the trapezium, and internally two smooth surfaces, one for the magnum, the other for the base of the 3rd metacarpal; the base

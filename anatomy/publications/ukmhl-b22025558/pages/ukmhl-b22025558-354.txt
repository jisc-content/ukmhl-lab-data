Under this head we shall examine not only the globe of the eye but its appendages; these are the eyelids, the lachrymal apparatus, and the muscles ot the orbit. The muscles of the orbit are seven in number, viz. the levator palpebras superioris, the obliquus superior and inferior, and the four recti; to obtain a satisfac- tory view of these muscles, the roof and a considerable portion of the external side of the orbit must be re- moved ; then the periosteum having been divided, the first muscle appears. Levator Palpebra5 Superioris is the highest muscle in the orbit; it arises narrow and tendinous from the upper edge of the foramen opticum, passes forwards and outwards beneath the frontal nerve, and becoming broader, bends down in front of the eye ; it then ends in a dense cellular expansion which is in- serted into the superior border ot the tarsal cartilage and into the superior palpebral sinus of the conjunctiva behind the palpebral ligament. Use, to elevate and retract into the orbit the upper eye-lid. OsLiauus Superior, at the upper and inner part of the orbit, arises on the inner side of tlie preceding, passes forwards along the os planum, ends in a round tendon which plays through the fibro cartilaginous pul- ley which is attached to the inner angle of the os fron- tis ; this tendon is then reflected backwards, outwards, and downwards, between the superior rectus and the eve, and then becoming broad and thin, is inserted into the sclerotic coat between the superior and external recti, about midway between the entrance of theneive and the insertion of the superior rectus. Use, to diaw

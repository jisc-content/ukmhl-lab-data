410 points, tliero are frequently accessory points or epiphy- ses found in the processes, as well as on the surfaces ot the body. These are the general characters of all the vertebrae, but each of the three classes present some peculiarity. , . , ^ . The Lumbar Verlebrcs are five ; these are the largest in the column; the bodij of each is very broad trans- verselv, compared with its height; its upper and lower surfaces are flat, and bordered with hard projecting edf^es, which render it concave from above downwards cn'its forepart. The lamince are thick, broad, but short; the notches, particularly the lower, are very large ; the svinousprocess is broad, flat, and square, and ends not m a point, but in a thick, rough border : the articulating processes are oval, strong, and vertical; the superior arc concave and look inwards; the inferior are convex and look outwards ; the transverse processes are long, t un, and horizontal, and more anterior than those of the dor- sal vertebrae ; the spinal foramen is triangular, and larger than in the back ; the body of the 5th lumbar vertebra cut off obliquely below, so as to be much thicker be- fore than behind ; its transverse processes are short, strone, and rounded. , , „ The dorsal vertebree are twelve in number, and of an intermediate size between the cervical and lumbar; they decrease from the 1st to the 4th, and then increase io the last, so that the 4th and 5th are the small- est. The body is thicker behind than before, and longer from before backwards than transversely, flat above and below, and round, except in the 1st, whose surfaces are heart shaped, and very convex anteriorly ; on either side !t prese^fs tivo smalf depressions or notches cove^d whh cartilage ; the superior is the tebrse are conjoined two of these notches foi^^^^ denression for the head of each nb; the lamince a e broad and thick ; the notches are large and anteiioi to the oblique processes; and larc/e and directed backwards ; on the fiont ot eac . of‘he two las,, ‘|'0- - ^ presssion covered with cartilage foi ai o .j j tubercle of the rib; the a^ the superior directed backwards, t le i ^ineus the spinal hole or canal is small and oval , the .pine

i<2 SECTION IV. DISSECTION OF THE PALATE AND ITS MUSCLES. The velum ’pendulum palati is a soft moveable sub- stance, attached superiorly and anteriorly to the hard palate on each side of the tongue and pharynx, and posteriorly and inferiorly it terminates in a thin edge, from the centre of which the uvula descends, thus giv- ing a lunated appearance to the edge of the velum on each side; these crescentic edges are named the half arches of the palate. The velum is situated obliquely, its fixed edge being superior and anterior to the loose, one surface looking forwards and downwards towards the mouth and tongue, the opposite surface looking up- wards and backwards; during life this aspect can be altered by the action of muscles, which can either ele- vate, depress, or make tense the velum. Beneath the mucous membrane of the velum several small glands are situated, chiefly on the inferior surface. The uvula is a conical prolongation of the velum, enclosing small glands, loose cellular membrane, and some muscular fibres; in deglutition, the velum and uvula are raised so as to touch the back part of the pharynx, and thus they are of use in preventing the food ascending into the upper or nasal part of the cavity, from which it might regurgitate into the nares. The muscles of the velum are five pair, the levator and tensor palati, the motor uvulae, palato-glossus and palato-pharyngeus. Levator-Palati, arises narrow from the petrous bone, in front of the foramen caroticum and behind the Eustachian tube, descends obliquely inwards, and is in- serled broad into the velum ; its name denotes its use. Tensor-Palati vel circumflexus palati, arises fleshy from a depression at the root of the internal pte- rygoid plate, from the spinous process of the sphenoid, and from the forepart of the Eustachian tube, descends between the internal pterygoid plate and muscle, ends in a flat tendon, which turns round the hamular process inwards to the velum, it then expands, and joins that from the opposite side. Use, to make tense the velum in a horizontal direction between the hamular processes.^ Motor Uvul®, atises from the posterior extremity or spine of the palate bones, descends close to its fel-

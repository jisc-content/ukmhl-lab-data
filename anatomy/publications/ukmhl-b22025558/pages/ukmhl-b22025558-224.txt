is slightly curved beneath the symphysis pubis. The vagina is directly below the urethra ; in the child it is partially closed in front by a crescentic fold of mem- brane, termed the hymen : in the adult several reddish eminences surround this opening ; the course and con- nexions of this canal will be better seen when the pelvis shall have been divided for the purpose of examining the internal organs of generation. Dissect off the in- teguments and fascia from the perinaeum and labia, and the following muscles may be seen : the sphincter ani, levator ani, and coccygaeus; these are similar to the muscles of the same name in the male perinaeum, also the transversalis perinaei; the erector clitoridis is ana- logous to the compressor penis ; and the. sphincter vaginae corresponds to the acceleratores urinae; it ex- tends from the clitoris superiorly around each side of the vagina to the central point of the perinaeum in front of the anus. To examine the internal organs of gene- ration make a lateral section of the pelvis in the same, manner as was directed in the dissection of the male pelvis. The peritonaeum may be first examined; this will be seen to descend along the fore-part of the rec- tum, to within three or four inches of the anus; it is thence reflected forwards on the posterior part of the vagina, the superior third of which it covets ; from the^ vagina it ascends on the posterior surface and sides of the uterus, continues round the superior fundus of this organ to its anterior part, on which it descends as low as the commencement of the vagina; it is thence le- flected to the bladder, and is continued over this organ, as in the male subject, to the abdominal muscles ; thus, in the female pelvis, the peritonEEum forms one cul ue sac between the rectum and vagina, and another be- tween the uterus and bladder. From each side of the uterus a broad fold of periionaium is extended trans- versely towards each iliac fossa; these folds are the broad ligaments of the uterus; enebsed between the laminEE of each of these are the Fallopian tube,^ round limment of the uterus, and the ovarium with its ligament and vessels. Dissect off the pentoiuEum from one side of the rectum and vagina, and the pelvic viscera will be more distinctly seen; the rectum takes

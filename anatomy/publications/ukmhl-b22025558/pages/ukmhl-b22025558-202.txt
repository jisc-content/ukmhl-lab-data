192 gular space or portion of the bladder, just above and behind the prostate gland, which is bounded on eithei side by the vasa deferentia and vesiculae seminales, pos- teriorly by the cul de sac of the peritonaeum, and an- teriorly by the prostate gland which forms the apex of this triangle; within this space the muscular coal oi the bladder is in contact with the rectum, and from the cavity of the latter the former organ may be perforated during life without injuring any important part ; this space is about three inches and a half, or four inches from the anus, and is selected by some surgeons as the best situation for tapping the bladder in case ot reten- tion of urine, when a catheter cannot be passed througti the urethra. The student may now proceed to exa- mine the pelvic viscera; for this purpose, separate the left crus penis from the bone, also the left border of the triangular ligament (if not already done), and detach the levator ani muscle of the left side from the bone, with the hand separate the cellular and aponeuiotic bands which lie superior to this muscle; then divide the symphysis pubis, or saw the left os pubis abou a t an inch external to the symphysis, divide the le t iho- sacral articulation, cut through the psoas muscle an iliac vessels, and then remove the os innominatum and lower extremity of the left side; the pelvm vscera wdl remain in the concavity of the sacrum and of oppo- site os innominatum. These viscera will be rendered more distinct by a little dissection,, first, moderately m flating the bladder through the ureter, a ligature having been tied around the penis, the rectum also may be moderately distended with curled hair or a ^ponge, and attached to the spine by a ligature. The pelvic portion of theperitonceum should be first attended ^ brane nuiy be now seen to descend fore-nart of the rectum to within about four inches ot he anus whence it is reflected on the lower and back part of the bladder: the line of this ^eflecUon ^ Lumbent position of the subject, marein of the third piece of the sacrum ; in the erect posture it will be foJnd on a level with the junctmn of [he sacrum and coccyx; the peritonseum is reflected the bladder between the middle of the vesiculÂ®

89 the head, and steadying it on the spine; this pair is partly covered by the last muscles; a portion of them, however, is seen between these: both the recti resemble the continuation of the inter-spinous muscles. Obliquus Capitis Inferior, is the strongest of these small muscles; it arises inferior and external to the posterior rectus, and superior to the spinalis colli, from the spinous process of the 2d vertebra, ascends obliquely backwards and outwards, and is inserted into the extremity of the transverse process of the atlas. Use, to rotate the head and atlas on the 2d vertebra, co-operating with the splenius of the same side, and the sterno-inastoid of the opposite side: this muscle is covered by the complexus, trachelo-mastoideus, and trapezius. Obliquus Capitis Superior, smaller than the last, above the insertion of which it arises, narrow, from the upper part of the transverse process of the atlas, ascends obliquely inwards, overlapping the rec- tus, and is inserted broad into the occipital bone, be- tween its transverse ridges, just behind the mastoid process. Use, to bend the head to one side, and draw it a little backwards ; any rotatory power it can exert (which must be slight) will oppose the last described muscle. In the dissection of the muscles of this re- gion, but few vessels or nerves of size or note are met with ; the arteries which supply these muscles are branches of the occipital and deep cervicrd su- periorly; the posterior branches of the intercostals in. the middle, and of the lumbar ai'teries below; the nerves are the small posterior branches of the cervical, dorsal and lumbar spinal nerves. i 2

tooth. Use, to raise the lower jaw wlien tlie whole mus- cle acts; the anterior fibres may also advance the jaw, and the posterior long fibres can draw it backwards, while the inferior transverse fibres, which are nearly pa- rallel to the external pterygoid muscle, may assist in the lateral and rotatory motions of the jaw ; this muscle, particularly its posterior portion, is the greatest secu- rity which the jaw possesses against dislocation. The temporal muscle is covered by the integuments, occipito frontalis, superficial temporal vessels and nerves, tempo- ral fascia, zygoma and masseter ; it lies on the side of the cranium, and covers the deep temporal vessels, and part of the external pterygoid and buccinator muscles. The temporal muscle 'Consists of two laminae of fleshy fibres, with an aponeurosis or tendon concealed be- tween them Remove the temporal, masseter and buc- cinator muscles, also the zygomatic arch, saw or break off, low down, thecoronoid process, dissect away some fat, and the pterygoid muscles will be exposed, the dis- section of which may be still further facilitated by di- viding the side of the lower jaw in front of the insertion of the masseter, and then draw-ing the angle and ramus backwards and forwards. Pteuygoideus Internus is strong and thick, placed on the inner side of the ramus of the jaw, arises tendi- nous and fleshy from the inner side of the external pterygoid plate, and pterygoid process of the palate bone; it fills the greater part of the pterygoid fossa, descends obliquely outwards and backwards, and is in- serted tendinous and fleshy into the inner side of the angle of the jaw, and into the rough surface above it. Use, to elevate the jaw, if the muscles of the opposite side act together; if, alternately, they can rotate it,each moving the jaw laterally, so as to turn it to the oppo- site side. This muscle is larger than the external pterygoid, inferior and external to which it lies, the term internal only referring to the relation of its origin. The tensor palati, superior constrictor, and submaxil- lary gland, are in contact with it internah^-: the ramus of the jaw is external to it, and separated from it by the dental artery and nerve, which are protected from the pressure of the muscle by the internal lateral ligament

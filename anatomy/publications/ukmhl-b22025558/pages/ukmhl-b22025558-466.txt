456 nal branch which leads to tlie great trochanter and is very long, the adductor magnus, gluteus maximus, and vastus externus are attached, the internal branch is short, and not very distinct, it leads to the lesser tro- chanter and gives attachment to the adductor brevis, pectinasus, vastus internus, and some fibres of the ilia- cus internus; to the lower and external branch of the linea aspera, the vastus externus and short head of the biceps are attached, and to the lower and internal, the vastus internus and adductor magnus adhere; these lines continue as low as the condyles, the internal is smooth and nearly obliterated near its middle for the passage of the crural artery. The upper or pelvic extremity of the femur presents three eminences, the head for articulation with the cotyloid cavity and the trochanters for the insertion of muscles. The head h of a globular figure, and forms a considerable segment of a sphere, it is directed upwards, foi wards and inwards; a little below its centre, there is a rough depression for the in- sertion of the round or articular ligament; with the ex- ception of this depression the head is covered through- out with cartilage, it is supported by an elongated process, the neck which forms an angle, more or less obtuse, with the shaft of the bone, the direction of this process is upwards, inwards, and a little forwards, it is flattened before and behind, thicker at the shaft than at the head, its lower edge is longer but smaller than the upper; a rough irregular line separates the head from the neck, beyond which the articular cartilage does not extend, and at its juncture to the shaft two rough lines extend inwards and downwards, from the great to the lesser trochanter, one on the fore, the other on the back part of the bone, into these the capsular liga- ment is inserted. The great trochanter is continuous with the external side of the shaft, and nearly in a line with its axis, it is on a little lower level than the head, it is thick, rough and square, externally it is broad and convex, tlie tendon of the gluteus maximus moves over this surface and an intervening bursa, a prominent ridge bounds it below, to this some fibres of the vastus externus are attached, internally it presents a pit or digital cavity which receives the tendons of the external

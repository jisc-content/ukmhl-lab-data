15 oFthe the lower extremity of this muscle is super- ficial, and lies between the parotid and submaxillary glands. Pterygoideus Exterxus is short and triangular, placed at the lower part of the temporal fossa, arises broad and fleshy from the outer side of the external pterygoid plate, from the crest on the great wing of the sphenoid, and from the back part of the tuberosity of the superior maxilla; the fibres pass outwards and backwards, nearly horizontal and converging, are in- serted, tendinous into the anterior and internal part of the neck of the lower jaw, and of the interarticular car- tilage, Use, to draw forward the jaw and interarticu- lar cartilage; if only one act, it will turn the jaw to the opposite side, so as to triturate or grind the food. These muscles are the chief agents in producing dislo- cation of the jaw; when the mouth is widely opened their spasmodic action may suddenly draw theâ€˜condyles forwards off the tubercles into the zygomatic fossae. The external pterygoid muscle lies in a transverse di- rection beneath the base of the cranium, and much fur- ther from the surface than the internal pterygoid, superior to which it lies; it is internal, and inferior to the temporal muscle, and is also concealed by the mas- seter. As the external and internal pterygoid muscles arise so near each other, aud thence pass in different directions to their insertion, the external going trans- versely, and the internal descending, they leave be- tween them a triangular space, which contains a quan- tity of fat, a small portion of the parotid gland, the in- ternal maxillary artery and vein, and the dental and gus- tatory branches of the inferior maxillary nerve.

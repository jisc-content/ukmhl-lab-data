327 fourth sacral, passes through the great sciatic notcli in- ternal to the preceding.; it then re-enters the pelvis by the lesser sciatic notch, and passing upwards and for- wards along the internal surface of the tuber ischii to- wards the pubis, it divides into two branches, an infe- rior and superior ; the inferior ascends obliquely for- wards and inwards along the ramus of the ischium to the perinasum, and is distributed to the muscles and in- teguments in that region, also to the scrotum ; the su- perior branch continues its course along the ramus of the pubis nearly to the symphysis, it then passes for- wards along the dorsum of the penis, increases in size as it approaches the glans penis, in the subcutaneous cellular tissue of which it terminates; in the female the inferior branch of the pudic nerve supplies the labium, the superior, the clitoris. The great sciatic or •posterior crural nerne is the principal branch of the sacral plexus, and the largest nerve in the body; it proceeds from the four su- perior sacral nerves, escapes from the pelvis below the pyriform muscle, sometimes through it, it then descends along the back of the thigh over the gemini, quadratus, and adductor magnus as far as the ham, where it divides into the external and internal pop- liteal nerves; in this course this nerve is covered su- periorly by the glutseus maximus and the hamstrings, interiorlj’ by the fascia lata and the integuments ; the sciatic nerve sends off several cutaneous and muscular branches, the latter supply the hamstrings, the gracilis, and the adductor magnus. The external popliteal or the peronceal nerve descends obliquely outwards alono- with the biceps tendon to the external condyle of the femur, it then turns forwards through the peronseus longus, round the neck of the fibula, and divides into two branches, the musculo-cutaneous and anterior ti- bial; the peronaeal nerve, before it arrives at the head of the fibula, sends off two or three long branches, term- ed the external cutaneous nerves of the leg ; these de- scend along the outer and back part of the leg, and communicate with the external saphenus nerve a branch of the posterior tibial. The musculo-cutaneous nerve descends between the peronaeus longus and extensor digi-

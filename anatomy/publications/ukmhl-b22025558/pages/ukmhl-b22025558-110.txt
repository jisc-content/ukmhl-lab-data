100 long head gives support to the inferior part of the capsular ligament of the shoulder, and so tends to protect that joint against dislocation, in that situation where it would be most likely to occur. The sudden contraction of the triceps during life sometimes breaks oftâ€™ the olecranon process, and draws upwards the se- parated portion, of course the individual loses for some time the pow'er of extending the forearm ; the frac- tured piece, however, is prevented being separated to any considerable distance by the aponeurosis of the triceps which covers the olecranon and whicli joins the fascia of tlie forearm, and also by the inferior fibres of this muscle, which being connected to the condyles, and having to ascend a little to the olecranon, tend to draw down its fractured portion. The 1st, or long head of the triceps, arises between the two teres muscles ; the second, or outer head, below the teres minor; and the third, or the bracluEeus internus, or posticus, below the teres major; the long and the second lieads are covered above by the deltoid, the remainder of them is superficial; the second lies ex- ternal to the supinator longus and radial extensors of the carpus; the third or internal head is also superfi- cial, and lies between the brachialis antiticus and co- raco-brachialis anteriorly, and the long portion of the triceps posteriorly; the ulnar nerve descends along this, and the radial or spiral, separates it from the second or outer head ; a small bursa lies between the tendon and the point of the olecranon, a larger one between the skin and the aponeurosis which covers that process ; this superficial bursa is peculiarly liable to inflamma- tion, which is generally of an unhealthy character, in consequence of an injur}', such as a fall upon the elbow producing a superficial lacerated wound. In the dis- section of the muscles of the arm, we should notice the course of the brachial artery and of its principal branches, also the divisions of the axillary plexus of nerves : the cutaneous veins have been already noticed; the deep veins accompany the arteries, two to each. The brachial artery, which is the continuation of the subclavian and axillarv, descends obliquely outwards, along the inner side, first of the coraco-brachialis, and

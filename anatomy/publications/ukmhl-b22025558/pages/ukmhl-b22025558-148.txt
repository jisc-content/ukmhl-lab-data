138 deep fasciae of the abdomen; divide the fascia transver- salis from Uie spine of the ilium towards the rectus muscle; dissect it carefully down from the peritonaeum, then push up this membrane, together with the caecum or sigmoid flexure of the colon, out of the iliac fossa, to which they are connected by very loose cellular mem- brane ; we thus obtain a view of the internal surface of Poupart’s ligament, and of the parts which pass beneath it, and which naturally fill the space or cavity of the crural arch: first observe the fascia transversalis attached to the inner lip of the ilium and to Pouparts ligament from the spine of that bone, as far as the pubis, into the linea innominata of which it is inserted ; here also it is inseparably joined to the conjoined tendons of the internal oblique and transverse muscles : as this fascia is passing anterior to the iliac or femoral vessels, a portion of it extends beneath Poupait’s ligament, in front of these vessels, so as to form the anteriov jHirt uj their sheath ; this process of the fascia transversalis soon be- comes thin and indistinct, and is lost in the cribuform part of the fascia lata. TheJascia iliaca is a tolerably strong aponeurosis; it covers the iliac and psoas mus- cles, passes behind the iliac vessels, and adheres to the unner margin of the pelvis; externally it is connecteu to the inner edge of the ilium, and inferiorly it is attached to Pounart’s ligament, and to the fascia transversalis, from the spine of the ilium as far inwards as the ihac arterv • here it presents a semilunar edge, separates from Foa,wit’s ligament, and from the fjwcia transversal.s, nasses behind the femoral vessels, forms the postenor part of the sheath, adheres to the pubis, and to the LpsJ of the hip joint and is connected to he pub c or^pectimeal portion of the fascia lata. The fascia transversalis and iliaca may be compared to a funnel, containing in the superior wide portion the penton^euni and its contents, andl enclosing m the inferior narrow Zxt ov pipe, the femoral vessels, and one or two lym- ^ aVinds- of this funnel the fascia transversalis £rtt lt’e,.ior, a„d the fascia iliaca the postenor S t esc fascite may be now seen to be perfectly con- rr ith each other, between the vessels and the spine of the ilium; different names only being applied

513 the subclavian vein, to allow the warm water and coagii- Ja to pass out ; when this has happened, a ligature pre- viously applied is to be firmly tied round the vessel, which will prevent the injection from flowing out; the same rule applies to the injection of veins in the lower extrernity. The veins of the head and neck are gene- rally injected from the superior longitudinal sinus : it IS scaicely necessary to mention that veins are filled with bluefluid, and the arterieswith white or red; for the blue injecuon smalt lilue is usually employed. To inject the arteries a transverse cut is to be made in the aorta, as c ose to its origin from the heart as possible. Care rniist be taken that the extremity of the pipe does not project so lar as to pass into the innominata, or one of the ves- sels arising from the leftside of the arch, as this ivould give only a partial injection. The nozzle of the pipe being carefully inserted into the opening of the vessel, two pieces^of twine are to be introduced under the vessel • one 01 these is to be firmly tied round the artery, this w 1 enabrace the nozzle of the pipe,its loose extremities, when the knot is firmly tied, are to be fixed to the wings of the pipe in order to prevent any chance of its slippinir out ol tlm vessel. The other ligature is to remain loose under the vessel, beyond the nozzle of the pipe about one inch. After injection is thrown in, this ligature is a so to be firmly tied round the vessel, leaving the pipe clear; the use of it is, that the injection may not return back when the pipe is removed from the aorta. This pre- caution IS more particularly necessary when the paint injec ion is useck In inserting a pipe into a small artery em, some difficulty may arise in the introduction from the pipe being larger than the calibre of the vessel • in his case the point of a scissors should be introduced’in- to the vessel and gradual dilatation produced by slowlv opening its blades. When the injection has rimained sufficiently long to set well in the vessels, dissection may be commenced, and here it is a rule which should be invariably followed, that the dissection be completed in as short a time as is consistent with a proper d^isplay of the vessels, for many preparations are lost in^conseSueLe of the part hrst dissected becoming spoiled before the rca.a,„der .a prepared ,br dryin .. care shol

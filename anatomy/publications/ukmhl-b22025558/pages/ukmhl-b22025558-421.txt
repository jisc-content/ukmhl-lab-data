411 processes are long, of a prismatic or triangular form, bent downwards very much, or imbricated, and tubercu- lar at their extremities. The 1 st has the body long trans- versely, and on either side a full depression above for the head of the 1st rib, and half of a similar cavity be- low for the upper part of the head of the second rib; its spinous process is thick, Jong, and horizontal, and its articular processes are oblique : the 10th has also a full depression for the 10th rib, the lllh and 12th in like manner ; these also want the articulating depressions on the transverse processes; the 12lh also resembles the lumbar, in the shape of its bodjq and inferior articular processes. The cervical vertcbrce are seven in number and smaller than the others; their body is long transversely, a little deeper before than behind; the lower surface is concave from behind forwards, the upper is larger or broader, and concave from side to side; the structure is more compact than in the dorsal and lumbar; the In- viinte are long and narrow, sharp and small superiorly, round and large inferiorly, so as to overlap those below; the spinal hole is large and triangular ; the notches are small and anterior to the articular processes; they are nearly of equal size above and below ; the spinous pro- cess is short, horizontal and bifid ; the transverse pro- cess is short, bifid, grooved above for the nerves, ^ancl perforated near its base by a round hole for the verte- bral vessels ; it is on a plane anterior to the transverse processes of the back or loins, and appears, on account of its foramen, to have a second or anterior root from the body of the vertebra: the articular processes are ob- lique, the superior oyal, slightly convex, look upwards and backwards; the inferior also oval, are concave, and directed downwards and forwards. The 1st cervical vertebra or atlas differs from the re- maining, in having a mere bony ring, without any dis- tinct body or spinous process, the anterior part of this ring is tubercular before, but presents posteriorly a smooth and concave oval articulating surface wliich re- ceives the odontoid process of the 2nd vertebra- the margin of this ring gives attachment to ligaments â€¢ it is round and thick behind, with a tubercle, instead of

311 which proceed several filaments to supply the tneni- brane lining the vestibule and semi-circular canals.— (bee Anatomy of the Ear.) Glosso-phai{angeal Nekve, or the first branch of the eighth pair ; this small nerve passes through the loramen lacerum posterius by a distinct canal, it then passes downwards and forwards anterior and internal to Che jupilar vein and carotid artery, and behind the ^'jlO'Pl'^ryngeus muscle ; it then winds round this muscle to its fore-part and descends obliquely inwards between it and the stylo-glossus to the posterior and ateral parts of the tongue; in this course this nerve terms an arch nearly parallel to that which the gusta- tory and lingual nerves describe; the glosso-pharyn- geal IS smaller than either of these nerves ; it is situated between them, but deeper than either; and has very iitt'.e, ifanjq communication with them. As thi^ nerve leaves the cranium it sends one or two small twio-s into the temporal bone, these communicate with the carotid plexus in the cavernous sinus; it is next at- tached to the facial, pneumo.gastric, and sympathetic- nerves by small filaments, whicli are connected toge- ther by loose reddish cellular membrane, and entan- g^d with several small vessels. This nerve next aives oft some branches to the pharyngeal plexus, some of these descend along the neck, and unite with the sym- pathetic and cardiac nerves, others ascend to the amygdala, and assist in forming the tonsillitic plexus • as It approaches the pharynx, this nerve gives several branches to the stylo-pharyngcus and hyo-glossus muscles, also to the superior and middle constrictors ot the pharynx ; several filaments pass between these to the mucous membrane of the pharynx and fauces aUo to the folds or arches of the palate and to the epiglottis; the remaining branches of the glosso-pha ryngeal nerve are distributed to tbe muscular Lb stance, papillae, and mucous membrane at the root of the tongue.

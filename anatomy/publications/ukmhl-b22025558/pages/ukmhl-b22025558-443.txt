433 horizontal and arises by two roots, one anterior covered by cartilage, narrow externall}', broad internally, runs transversely in front of the glenoid cavity, the other passes horizontally backwards, and bifurcates, one por- tion turns in to the glenoid fissure, the other is gra- dually lost above the mastoid process ; where these two roots of the Zygoma unite, there is a small tubercle to which the external lateral ligament of the lower jaw is attached; the zygoma thence bends forwards and downwards, slightly curved, convex outwards, and ends in a serrated edge which joins the malar bone; between the root of this process and the squamous plate there is a smooth trochlea, over which the posterior part of the temporal muscle moves; behind the transverse root of this process is the articular or glenoid cavity, which is crossed by the Glasserian fissure; this leads inwards and forwards, into it the capsular ligament is inserted, and near its centre is a small hole through whicli^the chorda tympani nerve and the laxator tympani muscle pass; to this fissure also, the processus gracilis of the malleus is attached ; the anterior part only of this ca- vity enters into the maxillary articulation, the posterior is filled by the parotid gland, and is bounded by the auditory process; this leads inwards andi forwards be- hind the glenoid cavity from the external auditory bole, which is between the two divisions of the outer root of the zygoma; this process or meatus is a twisted plate of bone, united above to the squamous plate, but pre- senting below a rugged edge to which the cartilage of the ear is attached ; the meatus takes a direction for- wards, inwards, and a little downwards, it is wider about the centre than at the extremities, it leads to the membrana tympani. The squamous plate internally is marked by vessels and by the convolutions of the brain like the other bones of the cranium ; its upper edge is bevelled of! and is very rough to overlap the parietal bone. The mammillary or mastoid is the posterior in- ferior portion, it is joined to the parietal bone above, and to the occipital behind, by a very deeply serrated edge, inferiorly it is prolonged into a rough nipple-like process, the mastoid, internal to which is a groove for the occipital artery, and another partly behind it for the V I*

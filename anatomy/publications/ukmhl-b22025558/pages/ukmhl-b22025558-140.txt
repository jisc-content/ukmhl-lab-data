130 rior tendon is described by some, not improperly, as di- viding into three layers : the posterior, very strong, is continuous with the fascia lumborum ; the middle, thinner and weaker, is attached to the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae, and is separated from the former by the lumbar muscles; and the anterior lamina, which is the weakest, is expanded over the quadratus lumbo- rum, and the inferior part of the diaphragm, and is con- nected to the sides of the bodies of the lumbar ver- tebrae. Ttie inlerior edge of the transversalis is in some degree confounded with that of the internal oblique, particularly at their origin from Poupart's ligament; it seldom, however, descends as low as that muscle, and it crosses the spermatic cord, or round ligament, just as either of these is about to enter the abdomen. Replace the oblique muscles, divide their tendons all along the side of the linea alba, and dissect them off the rectus towards the linea semilunaris: this anterior part of the sheath adheres so closely to the lineae transversae, that it is difficult to separate it from them. Rectus, long and flat, broader above than below, arises by a flat tendon, which is sometimes double, from the upper and anterior part of the pubis, ascends parallel to its fellow, becomes broad and thin above the umbilicus, and is inserted into the anterior part of the thorax by three fasciculi, the internal one of which is fixed to the ensiform cartilage and costo-xiphoid ligament; the middle longer and thinner to the car- tilage of the sixth rib ; and the external still broader and thinner to the cartilage of the fifth rib. Use, to bend the chest towards the pelvis, or to raise the latter towards the chest, also to compress the abdomen. The rectus is covered superiorly by the great pectoral, in the middle by the tendon of the external, and the an- terior layer of that of the internal oblique muscle, and inferiorly by the external oblique and the conjoined tendons of the internal oblique and transversalis, also by the pyramidalis. These muscles are much nearer to each other below than above; they are each enclosed in a distinct sheath, which consists, anteriorly, of the tendon of the external oblique and the anterior lamina of the internal oblique, posteriorly ot the posterior layer

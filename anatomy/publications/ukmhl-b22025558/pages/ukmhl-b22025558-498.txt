4-88 place in the situation of the glandulae agUilnatae ; ulce- ration however does not appear to be so common in the small as in the great intestines ; in dysenteric affec- tions of the great intestines, a great portion of the inner membrane is found hanging in shreds, occasioned by the great ravages of the ulceration ; while in some places, large patches of the mucous membrane have been totally stripped off, leaving the submucous coat quite bare, and appearing as if it had been dissected ; where this unfortunately happens, the raucous mem- brane is never afterwards repaired. Liver. The peri- toneal coat covering the liver, is not uncommonly found in a state of inflammation it is either affected by itself, or is included in general peritonitis; where the former happens, the anterior or convex surfaces are generally the parts inflamed, the same appearances exist, as de- scribed when speaking of pei itonil is, viz.: great crowding of small vessels containing florid blood, increased thick- ness and pulpiness of the membrane and an etfusion of coagulable lymph on the surface, which when organized forms permanent adhesions to the neighbouring visce- ra, and are found to exist more or less in every adult dead body. When the substance of the liver is inflamed (which is a rare occurrence in these countries,) it be- comes enlarged in size and of a purple colour, and harder to the touch than in its healthy state; if the inflammation continue for any length of time, abscesses are formed, which in some cases contain many pints of pus ; in persons labouring under an abscess of this kind, contracted in a warm climate, the liver will be found almost entirely converted into a bag holding nothing but pus. From the adhesions of the viscera from the previous inflammation, these abscesses generally dis- charge themselves by ulcerated openings into the sto- mach, transverse arch of the colon, or some coil of the small intestine. Tubercles of the liver. To describe the different kinds of tubercles mentioned by authors, is not our in- tention, as it would only tend to embarrass the student, without being of any essential service to him, more par- ticularly as writers themselves do not quite agree in their description of them. One of the most common

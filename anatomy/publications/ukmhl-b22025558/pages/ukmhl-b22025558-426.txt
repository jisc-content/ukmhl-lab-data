416 true costal cartilageSj and at its superior angle by half a notch, which joined to a similar notch in the first piece, formed the cavity for the 2nd cartilage: the five lower notches approximate, and the last is frequently completed by the xiphoid cartilage. This bone con- sists of a very spongy, cellular, and vascular tissue, co- vered on each surface by a compact layer. The Ribs are twelve on each side; they extend in an arched manner from the vertebrae towards the sternum, to which the seven superior are attached by separate cartilages; these are the or the sternal ribs ; the five inferior do not form complete circles, and are con- nected anteriorly to each other, and to the cartilage of the last true rib, and are named false ; the two last of these are sometimes called the floating ribs; the length of the ribs gradually increases from the 1st to the 8th, and then diminishes to the last; the breadth gradually diminishes from the 1st to the 12th, but in each rib it is greatest near the sternum; the 1st is nearly horizontal, the succeeding gradually incline downwards, so as to be lower before than behind ; the external surface of each is convex and smooth, and gives attachment to different muscles; the internal is concave, and lined by the pleu- ra ; the upper border is round and smooth, and gives at- tachment to the intercostal muscles ; the inferior is thin, and marked with a groove, which is deep posteriorly for the intercostal vessels ; this also gives attachment to the intercostal muscles. The posterior end of the rib pre- sents a head, neck, and tuberosity; the head is round, and divided by a ridge into two articular surfaces, which are received into the depressions in the dorsal vertebrae; an intervertebral ligament is attached to the middle ridge. The head is supported by the 7ieck, which is nar- row and round, and lies in fVont of the transverse process, to which it is connected posteriorly by the middle costo-transverse ligament. Beyond the neck is thetubercle, whichlooks backwards and downwards, and and is divided into two portions: the internal of these^ is smooth for articulation, with the transverse process of of the inferior of the two vertebrae, to whose bodies the head of the rib is connected; the outer portion is rough for the insertion of the external or posterior costo-

32 gual, Jabial or facial, auricular, occipital, pharyngeal, transverse facial, internal maxillary and temporal. The subclavian arteries are situated at the inferior and lateial part of the neck; the right arises from the arteria innominata, the l^t from the posterior part of the arch of the aorta; each subclavian artery passes up- wards and outwards to the anterior scalenus, behind which it passes ; it then turns downwards and outwards behind the clavicle, and over the first rib into the axilla; the difference in the origin causes an important differ- ence in the situation and connexions of the right and left subclavian in the early part of their course, the right being shorter and nearly transverse, lies higher in the neck, and more superficial than the left, which arises deep in the thorax, out of which it ascends perpendi- cularly before it turns outwards to pass between the scaleni; after this point, these vessels are similar in every respect; each gives off the following branches, viz. arteria vertebralis, raammaria interna, axis thyro- idea, cervicalis profunda, and intercostalis superior. The external jugular vein has been already noticed ; the internal jugular vein 0^ each side commences at the termination of the lateral sinus in the foramen lacerum posterius, descends along the outer side, first, of the internal, and afterwards of the common carotid artery, and at the inferior part of the neck joins the subclavian vein, which returns the blood from the upper extremity, and accompanies the subclavian artery; the junction of each jugular and subclavian, which is posterior to the sternal end of each clavicle, forms the right and left venae innominatae; these veins enter the chest, and uniting, commence the superior vena cava, as will be seen in the dissection of the thorax.â€”For the more particular description of the vessels of the neck, see the anatomy of the vascular system. The gustatory nerve is the principal branch of the inferior maxillary, or third division of the fifth pair ; it is seen, on dividing the mylo-hyoid, taking an arched course parallel to the stylo-glossus muscle, from within the angle of the jaw towards the tip and side of the tongue ; it accompanies the Whartonian duct, and rises above the sublingual gland, between it and the tongue;

l64 each proceed a branch of the hepatic veins and ducts. Through the liver, therefore,sets of vessels ramify, in addition to numerous lymphatics, viz. the branches of the hepatic arteries, vena; portarum, hepatic ducts and hepatic veins : the venae portarum are supposed to be the vessels from which the bile is secreted; the he- patic arteries nourish the substance of the liver; the hepatic ducts carry the bile from this organ, and the venae cavae hepalicae return the blood which has circu- lated through the liver, to the inferior venae cavae, just as this vessel is passing through the diaphragm. Ihe vence cavce hepoiicce, three or four in number, are seen escaping from the liver at the superior thick edge, be- hind the coronary ligament, and immediately joining the inferior or ascending venae cavae. The three other vessels of the liver may be seen between the layers of the lesser omentum, the artery lying to the left side, the biliary duct to the right, the vena porta behind and between both; the artery and vein de- scend obliquely inwards towards the spine, behind the pancreas. The hepatic artery is a branch of the cffliac axis, and the vena porta commences in front of the last dorsal vertebra and behind the pancreas. The right and left hepatic ducts, on clearing the trans- verse fassure, unite and torm the hepfic duct, uhich descends for about one inch and a halt along the right side of the lesser omentum, is then joined by the cysUc duct, from the gall-bladder : the union of these forms the ductus communis choledochus; this vessel, about three inches long, descends vertically behind the pylorus, the upper part of the duodenum and the pancreas, and is imbedded in the substance of the latter, about the mid- dle of the internal or concave side of the middle divi- sion of the duodenum, this duct perforates the coats ot this intestine in a very oblique direction, and opens on a small papilla internally, opposite the lower angle ot the duodenum : as the ductus choledochus is about to perforate the'duodenum, it is in general joined by the duct from the pancreas. . , , i The gall bladder is situated in the right hypochon- drium in a depression on the inferior surface of the ng it lobe of the liver : this membranous sac is of a pyritorm figure j the large extremity or fundus being directec

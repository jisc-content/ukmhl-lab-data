31-2 the spinal accessory, glosso-pharyngeal, lingual, and sympathetic nerves ; to all these it is closely connected, and the nerve here has the compact appearance, and sometimes the greyish tint of a ganglion ; at first it is placed anterior to the vein and to the lingual nerve ; it soon, however, passes behind both and opposite the at- las, the vein separates it from the glosso-pharyngeal nerve which lies anterior to that vessel; the vagus then descends along the lore-part of the neck enclosed in the sheath of the carotid artery and jugular vein : in this sheath it is placed between these vessels, rathei behind and more closely connected to the vein ; on the right side this nerve enters the thorax between the sub- clavian vein and artery, crossing the latter at right angles ; on the left side it is also anterior but I'cai-ly parallel to the subclavian artery, a little below wbicli it crosses obliquely the back part of the arch ot the aorta ; in the thorax these nerves descend at first obliquely backwards behind the roots of the lungs and enter the posterior mediastinum, they then descend along the oeso- phagus through thediaphragmand terminate on the sto- mach. Each pneumo-gastric nerve gives off the following branches ; they may be divided into cervical, thoracic, and abdominal; the cervical branches are, the pharyn- '■•eal, superior laryngeal, cardiac and recurrent or infe- rior laryngeal. First, the jjhanjngeal nerve arises from the vagus near the base of the cranium, and soon receives a twig from the spinal accessory ; it descends obliquely inwards behind the carotid artery to the side of the pharynx, divides into several branches, which commu- nicate with those from the glosso-pharyngeal, laryn- geal, and sympathetic; all these brmiches form he vharuncreal\lexus ; this plexus extends along the stde of the middle and upper constrictor, and sends nurnei- ous filaments to each of these muse es and to the n u cous membrane of the pharynx and fauces, ^^eco 1, the superior laryngeal nerve arises a little below the last • it runs in an arched manner downwards and fo - wards behind the internal carotid artery, and below the superior cervical ganglion, with which it communicates, as dso with the^ingual nerve; it sends several fila- ments to the pharyngeal plexus and then divides into

67 ramifications of the bronchial tubes, which end in numer- ous air cells ; these are collected at first in clusters, and joined by cellular membrane into lobules : these last are again united into larger masses by the pleura, so as to form lobes ; the air-cells are the terminations of the bronchial vessels ; they are globular, are lined by mucous membrane and covered by a fibrous, or, as some sup- pose, a muscular lamina; each bronchus divides into two branches, these again subdivide into two, and so on in binary order; these canals increase in number, and di- minish in size ; their final capillary branches end in small sacs or air cells; these constitute the principal bulk of the lung: the larger bronchial tubes are composed of the same materials as the trachea, but in the smaller branches there is no cartilaginous structure. On their delicate parietes the fine capillaries of the pulmonary aiteries and veins are spread, and here during life is effected that important change in the blood, from venous to arterial, which appears to be the great design of the function of respiration. The soft and yielding tissue of the lungs admits of the free entrance and rapid cir- culation of the air through their cells, all which become distended in the moment of inspiration ; in this act the lungs are wholly passive, the air distending them in the exact proportion with which the parietes of the chest are expanded; in expiration, the contraction of the thorax expels a great portion of the air from the cells, and thus the lungs become diminished in capacity ; in effecting this change the elasticity, aided in all probability by the irritable or muscular energy of these organs may assist tiie muscular and elastic power of the parietes of the chest. In expiration the air-cells are not wholly emp- tied ; no power can completely discharge the air from lungs that have once breathed.â€”See Anatomy of the Diaphragm. VVe shall next direct our attention to the pericardium and the heart. The pericardium is a strong fibro-serous membrane, in the form of a conical bag, whose base is below and apex above; it is larger than the heart, which it en- closes, together with a portion of the great vessels con- nected to it, and over whose surface its internal or serous layer is reflected: the external fibrous lamina is

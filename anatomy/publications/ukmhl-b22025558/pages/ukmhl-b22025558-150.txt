140 tliere the femoral vessels fill up the space, and strong partitions pass from the fascia transversalis to the fascia iliaca on the inner side of the vein, and between it and the artery; these prevent the distension of the sheath ; the fascia propria also rounds olf the angle be- tween the fascia transversalis and the forepart of the vessels, and prevents a hernia occurring in front of the artery or vein ; external to these vessels the ciural arch is completely closed by the close connexion between the fascitE transversalis and iliaca to Poupart’s ligament, in front of the psoas and iliac muscles. Femoral hernia then can occur only at the femoral or crural ring; this disease is more frequent in the female than in the male, the crural arch and ring being larger in the former than in the latter ; femoral hernia descends through a sort of canal which commences at the crural ring, and ends at the saphenic opening in the fascia lata, through which the sac protrudes; the hernial sac in de- scending carries before it the fascia propria, descends in the sheath of the vessels along the inner side of the vein, and may remain in this situation for a considerable time; as the tumor increases in size it bursts through the sheath, and either tears or dilates some opening in the cribriform fascia, and then turns forwards into the groin ; if the tumor increase still further, it is found to turn upwards over Poupari s ligament, and to rest on the lower part of the tendon of the external oblique; the form of the crural ring, the course of the superfi- cial epigastric vessels, and the close connexion between the superficial and cribriform fasciae, account for its ascending in this manner. If we dissect oft the integu- ments from a femoral hernia of long standing, we shall find beneath them the superficial fascia so increased in thickness and vascularity as to present a compact and almost fleshy-like appearance; when this shall have been divided, the tumour can be brought down oft’ the abdomen into the groin, and will be found covered by a dense and smooth capsule, which often presents a glossy ai)pearance ; this is the fascia propria ; in dissecting oft this, it will in general be found to consist of several laminiE, which sometimes separate so easily and appear so distinct as to lead an inexperienced operator to sup-

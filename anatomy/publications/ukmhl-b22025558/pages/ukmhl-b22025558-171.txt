161 nary; these connect it to the diaphragm and abdominal muscles, and the lesser omentum attaches it to the sto- mach and duodenum. The suspensory or falciform ligament is a fold of per- itonaeum attached anteriorly by its convex border to the linea alba, to the rectus muscle of the right side, and to the diaphragm ; it passes obliquely backwards and to the right side, and is attached by its posterior or con- cave edge to the upper or convex surlace of the liver, on which its laminae separate, and expand over each side of this organ ; enclosed in the inferior edge of this fold is the obliterated umbilical vein, which substance in the adult is named the ligamentum teres: this, which is enumerated as the second ligament of the liver, ascends from the umbilicus, obliquely backwards, and to the right side, and is inserted into a notch in the thin or anterior edge of the liver, which notch is the com- mencement ot the umbilical or horizontal fissure of the liver. The right and left lateral ligaments are triangular folds, connecting the right and left lobes of the liver to the diaphragm : the left lateral ligament lies anterior to the cardiac orifice of the stomach; the right lateral ligament is directly above the right kidney. The coro- nary ligament is situated at the upper extremity of the falciform process, and consists of two laminae of peri- tonaeum, which separate from each other, and connect the superior thick edge of the liver to the diaphragm ; between the laminae of this process the liver is deprived’ of a serous covering, and is in contact with the diaphragm; this space lies anterior to the inferior vena cava. The liver is of an irregular form ; it is longer transversely than from before backwards; its posterior edge is very thick, and in contact with the diapliragnr ; its anterior edge is thin, convex, and on a level with tlie edge of the right hypochondrium, and with the lower part of the epigastric region ; two notches may be observed in this edge ; one below tbe falciform ligament, into which the round ligament or obliterated umbilical vein enters; the ether corresponds to the gall bladder. ° The superior or anterior surface is smooth and con- vex, and divided by the suspensory ligament into a V 2

275 brain, and in diiTercnt subjects: in the child it is red- dish, in the old it is grey or ashy. It consists of a number ol vtry minute globules, corineeted together by the pia mater and vessi Is. The xvhite or medullary sub- s'ance is more firm, and when fresh, has some elasticity, and in many parts appears distinctly fibrous; its di- vided surface appears dotted with red spots; these are the divided vessels, they vary in number and size in different subjects: in a very fresh brain, when a sec- tion has been made of this white substance, it will, by its elasticit}^, force the blood to exude out for some little time in small drops from the divided vessels. The iorpus callosum is now seen in the median line of the cerebrum, but nearer the frontal than tlie occipital bone, between three or four inches long, convex, white, marked by two or three raised longitudinal lines close and nearly parallel to each other, (the raphe,) from these several transverse lines pass to either side ; its posterior end broad, round, and a little concave, is bent downwards, and is continuous on either side with the fornix and the hippocampi; its anterior end is also round, and bent downwards and backwards, is conti- nued on each side into the anterior lobes, and in the middle it joins the tuber cinereum and the optic com- missure; the corpus callosum connects the white fibrous substance of the hemispheres, and is therefore properly called the great commissure of the cerebrum ; it covers the lateral ventricles, the septum lucidum, and the for. nix. Divide this substance at a little distance from cither side of the raphe, the lateral ventricles will be opened, press the middle portion of the corpus callo- sum to one side, and the septum lucidum may be seen descending in the median line from it to the upper sur- face of the fornix. 'I he septum lucidum separates the two lateral vet.triclcs, triangular, the apex behind, fhe base before, the upper end connected to the corpus callosum ; the lower edge to the forni.x posteriorly, amt anteriorly to the inferior curved portion of the corpus callosum ; it consists of four lamina", two on each side, grey externally, white internally j between the white laminae a small cavity exists termed the Jifth ventricle, I his cavity is naturally closed, but when the corpu*

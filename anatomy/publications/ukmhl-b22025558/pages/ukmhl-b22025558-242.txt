232 surface of this fascia, from the three anterior fourths of the crest of the ilium, from the superior semicircular line or ridge which leads from the anterior spinous pro- cess of the ilium to the upper part of the sciatic notch, and from the surface of the ilium, above and below that ridge ; the fibres descend in different directions, the middle perpendicularly, the anterior, which are very short, and the posterior, which are long, obliquely; they all converge into a strong and broad tendon, which is inserted into the upper and outer part of the great trochanter, and is attached anteriorly to the ten- don of the glutaeus minimus. Use, to abduct the thigh ; its posterior fibres can extend and rotate it out- wards, its anterior fibres can flex and rotate it inwards; it also serves to maintain the pelvis in equilibrio on the femur, as when standing on one leg. This muscle is covered in part by the glutaeus maximus ; the anterior and larger portion is covered only by the integuments and fascia lata; it lies on the glutaeus minimus, its pos- terior edge is parallel to the pyriform muscle, and se- parated from it by the glutaeal vessels and nerves; the anterior edge is nearly parallel to the tensot vaginae muscle, is united to it above, but separated from it be- low by a quantity of fat, and by several branches of the external circumflex vessels and nerves. GLUTiEUs Minimus, is exposed by detaching from its origin the glutaeus rnedius ; small, semicircular, more tendinous than the last, it arises from the inferior semi- circular ridge on the dorsum of the ilium, and from the rough surface between it and the edge of the acetabu- lum ; the fibres converge as they descend, and end m a strong round twisted tendon, Avhicb is inserted into the upper and anterior part of the great trochanter, nrst passing over a small bursa. Use, similar to the last, it also strengthens the ilio-femoral articulation, and ^ it adheres to the capsular ligament, it can draw this out of the joint in abduction of the thigh. This muscle is covered by the glutasus medius, and a little oveilap- ped by the tendon of the pyriformis, it covers the cap- sular ligament and the external tendon of the rectus. Pyriformis, is of a flattened triangular form, the base at the sacrum within the pelvis, the apex at the

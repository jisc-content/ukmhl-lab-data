502 brachialis internus suffer from the violent projection of the humerus. The brachial artery also has been rup- tured in this manner. The flexor muscles of the arm, by keeping it bent, and the triceps by its contraction, are the muscles which oppose reduction. The internal condyle of the humerus and the olecranon present two prominent points, which are of great importance in as- sisting us to detect injuries about the elbow-joint. In the extended position of the arm they are nearly on the same line, and any displacement of the bones will cause a corresponding displacement of these two prominences. The form of the bones, the strength of the lateral ligaments, and the numerous muscles surrounding the joint, prevent a complete lateral luxation of both ulna and radius, while a luxation forwards cannot occur svith- out fracture of the olecranon. OF DISLOCATIONS OF THE HUMERAL EXTREMITY OF THE RADIUS. The radius may be dislocated at the humeral extre- mity, either backwards or forwards. When the radius is driven through the back part of the capsular ligament it is found to rest above the external condyle of the humeres, supported by the brachial fascia. The acces- sory and annular ligaments are torn, and sometimes the interosseous ligament suffers at its superior part. In dislocation forwards of the radius, the head of the bone rests above the external condyle of the os humeri. The accessory and annular ligaments, with a portion of the interosseous ligament, are ruptured in this luxation as in the former. The biceps muscle becomes shorter by contraction, and thus may resist, though not in any great degree, reduction. OF DISLOCATION OF THE HUMERAL EXTREMITY OF THE ULNA. The ulna may be dislocated backwards on the os humeri without being accompanied by the radius. The coronoi'd process is forced over the pulley of the hume- rus into the sigmoid fossa, and the olecranon forms a

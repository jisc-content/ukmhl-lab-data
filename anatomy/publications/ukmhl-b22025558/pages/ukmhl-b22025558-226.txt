216 wards and backwards; each terminates in a soft fringed extremity, called Corpus fimbriatum ; these canals are narrow where they join the uterus, but each increases in size near the corpus fimbriatum. The ow/rta are two small, white, flattened, oval bodies, one at each side, enclosed in the posterior fold of the broad ligament, and behind the Fallopian tube. Each ovary is con- nected to the side of the uterus by the broad ligament of the latter, also by a round fibrous cord, the proper ligament of the ovary; this is about two inches long, and is enclosed between the laminae of the broad liga- ment of the uterus. Each ovary is covered by the peri- tonaeum, which adheres very closely to it; beneath this is a strong white fibrous capsule, within which a num- ber of small vesicles will be found connected together by cellular membrane and vessels. CHAP. VIII. dissection of the inferior extremities. Each inferior extremity is connected to the trunk bv the strong ligaments of the hip joint, and by several muscles which pass from the pelvis to the thigh and lee. This dissection may be performed while the pelvis remains attached to the spine, or the former may be separated from the lumbar vertebrae, and divided into ^"^The muscles of the lower extremity are classed into those of the thigh, leg, and foot.

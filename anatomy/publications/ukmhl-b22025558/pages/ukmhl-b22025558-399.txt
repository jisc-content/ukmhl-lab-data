That portion of blood which was transmitted directly from the ri^ht auiicle, through the foramen ovale into the left auricle descends into the left ventricle, from which it is also’ propelled into the aorta, the superior branches of ® through the upper parts of the body, wdience it is returned to the heart by the veins that form the superior vena cava. The de- scending aorta conveys the blood to the abdominal viscera, and at the fourth lumbar vertebra this ves- sel divides into the external and internal iliac arteries ha former ,s small in ,l.e child, the latter is v™'; large, and is named the umbilical or hypogastric sidPof ^ " forwards and upwards ^bfg the cends to tL S- follow, and as- cends to the umbilicus; these arteries then twine around the umbilical vein in the cord, and arriving at the placenta divide into numerous branches, whiclf ra- orteries thus serve the office 0 veins.

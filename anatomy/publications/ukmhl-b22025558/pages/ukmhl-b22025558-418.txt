40S temporal, two parietal, the occipital, the ethmoid and the sphenoid bones; to tliese may be added the small turbinated bones of the sphenoid or of Bcrtin, and the four auricular bones in each temporal bone, which have been already described in the anatomy of the ear. The face is divided into the upper and lower jaw ; the upper consists of the two superior maxillary, two pala- tine, two lachrymal, two nasal, two malar, two inferior turbinated bones and the vomer ; to these ma)' be added the sixteen teeth. The loxcer jaxv consists of the infe- rior maxillary bone, which contains sixteen teeth ; some consider the os hyoides as an appendix to the bones of the face ; this bone however has been already noticed in the description of the larynx. The pelvis is the lower extremity of the trunk; it con- sists of the sacrum, the coccyx, and the two ossa inno- minata. The superior or thoracic extremities are composed each of four parts, the shoulder, which consists of the clavicle and scapula; the arm, of the humerus; the fore-arm of the radius and ulna; and the hand, which is subdivided into the carpus, metacarpus, and fingers. The carpus consists of eight small bones ; the metacar- pus of five, and the fingers each of three phalanges ex- cept the thumb, which has only two. The inferior or abdominal extremities are each divided into three parts; the thigh, which consists of but one bone, the femur; the leg, which consists of three, the patella, tibia, and fibula ; and the foot, which is divided into three parts, the tarsus, metatarsus, and toes ; the tarsus consists of seven irregular bones, the metatarsus of five long bones, and the toes of the three phalanges each, except the great toe, which has only two. In the adult skeleton the number of bones amount to 242, in- cluding the bones of the ear and the teeth, but excluding the os hyoides and the sesamoid bones. THE vertebrae:. The VertebrcE are tw'enty-four in number, they belong to the class of irregular bones, are placed one above the other, and connected by ligaments so as to form one

90 CHAP. V. DISSECTION OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY. The upper extremity is connected to the trunk by the sterno-clavicular ligaments, and by ten muscles, of which one is connected to the clavicle (subclavius,) one to the humerus (pectoralis major,) and eight to the scapula, viz. Trapezius, levator anguli scapulae, omo- hyoid, rhomboid major and minor, serratus raagnus, pectoralis minor, and latissimus dorsi; this last is also inserted into the humerus; all these muscles have been already examined ; these the student may divide, then separate the extremity from the trunk, and place a block under the axilla ; the dissection of the arm, however, may be performed while it remains connect- ed to the body. The muscles of the upper extremity are classed into those of the shoulder and arm, forearm and hand. SECTION I. dissection of the muscles of the shoulder and ARM. Dissect off the integuments from the shoulder and arm as low as the bend of the elbow; beneath the skin and adipose substance is the draM aj)oneurom; this is weak and imperfect in some situations, as on the deltoid muscle; in others it is strong and well marked, and it increases in strength as it descends ; it is con- nected posteriorly to the spine of the scapula, and to the infra-spinatus muscle; inferior to this it receives an addition of fibres from the insertion of the deltoid ; in- ternally it is in part continued along the vessels from the fiiscia of the axilla, and in part also from the ten- dons of the great pectoral and latissimus dorsi; i in- vests the whole arm, confining the muscles m their situation, and pressing them towards each other, part -

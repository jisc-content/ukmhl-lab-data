186 is connected to it by cellnlar membrane, and in some cases is intimately joined to it. In some subjects a second muscle may be observed taking a transverse course (the transversalis alter;) this aiises from the ra- mus of the ischium, proceeds obliquely forwards and in- wards, and is inserted into the accelerator urinae. These muscles are very irregular in size in different persons, in some being found very distinct and strong, in others a few pale and scattered fibres only point out then- course and situation. Between the three last described muscles on each side, we may remark a triangular space, which is bounded externally^by the crus perns and the erector penis muscle, internally by the urethra and ac- celerator urinae j the'base is posteriorly, and is tormeU bv the transversalis perinaei muscle. This space con- tains a quantity of fat, also the perinaeal artery, veins, and nerves, branches of the pudic vessels and nerves ; into this space, on the left side of the pennaeum, the operator must sink his knife in the lateral operation of lithotomv, in order to lay bare the groove in the staff. In this incision the transversalis muscle and a*'tery the perimeum must be divided. Next dissect 6ie erector penis from the crus penis, also the acceleratores urinae muscles from the bulb and corpus iirelhriE; detach the transverse muscle from its attach- ments, and remove the vessels and cellular membiane out of the triangular space just now nress the bulb of the urethra to one side, fiom the crus penis, and between these two bodies we may observe a strong ligamentous substance, the passing in tb - ferenf directions; this is the triangular ligament of the urethra or the mter-osseous ligament of the perineum Se aler of this ligament is above, and is weak and cellulal being lost in front of the symphysis pubis, on the dorsal vessels of the penis; the sides are connec ed to the rami of the pubis and ischium ; its base ^ ow^rds the rectum, being connected m the middle line rtiTe Lntral point of tl^e P-ij-um on each sale o which it is thin and weak, and gradually lost (^n e surface of the levator ani. Through this ligament the urethra passes about an inch below the inferior edge of rhe sj'mpSJl pubis, aud as this canal passes through

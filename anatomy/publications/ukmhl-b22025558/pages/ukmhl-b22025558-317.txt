307 anterior to it, and both unite inseparably; the nerve then divides into two branches, superior and inferior; the superior or external immediately subdivides into the deep temporal, masseteric, buccal, and pterygoid branches; the inferior or internal division of the nerve is the larger, and subdivides into the auricular, inferior dental, and gustatory nerves. First, the deep temporal nerves are two in number, an anterior and posterior, they ascend between the temporal bone and muscle, and are lost in the latter ; some small branches escape through the temporal fascia and communicate with the cutaneous temporal nerves. Second, the Buccal nerve arises in general in common with one of the last, it passes forwards and downwards between the pterygoid muscles to the external of which, and to the temporal, it sends some branches, it then passes between the co- ronoid process and the buccinator muscle, and on the latter it divides into several long branches which form a plexus on this muscle with branches of the facial and infra-orbital nerves. Third, the jwrwsder/c branch de- scends obliquely backwards and outwards through the sigmoid notch of the inferior maxilla, between the tem- poral muscle and the neck of the lower jaw, close to the latter, to which also it sends some filaments, it is lost in the substance of the masseter muscle. Fourth, the Pterygoid branchesave two or three delicate branches which descend to the pterygoid muscle. The deep portion of the trunk of the inferior maxillary nerve may be traced into these muscular branches. The three branches of the inferior division are the auricular, den- tal, and lingual nerves ; first, the auricular or temporo- auricidar branch ; this passes backwards and outwards behimt the neck of the lower jaw, and before the mea- tus auditorius; it here communicates with the facial nerve, and sends small filaments to the meatus and to the cartilages of the car, also to the articulation of the lower jaw; it then ascends through the parotid gland over the zygoma and divides into an anterior and posterior branch which follow the divisions of the temporal artery, communicate with the facial nerve and are lost in the integuments on the anterior and la- teral parts of the head. Second, the inferior dental nerve separates from the gustatory, and is connected to

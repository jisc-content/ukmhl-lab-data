376 and minimus muscles. 7th, The obturator artery passes out of the pelvis by the superior part of the thyroid hole into the upper part of the thigh beneath the pecti- naeus, and divides into several branches to supply the obturator and adductor muscles. 8th, The sciatic ar- tery passes over the pyriform muscle and escapes from tlie pelvis by the lower part of the sciatic notch, along with the sciatic nerve ; it sends several branches to the glutseus maximus, the hamstrings, and adductor mag- nus; also to the small capsular muscles and to the scia- tic nerve; these communicate with the circumflex and perforating arteries. 9th, The internal pudic artery smaller than the preceding, leaves the pelvis along with it below the pyriform muscle, re-enters the cavity be- tween the sciatic ligaments, and then ascends obliquely inwards and forwards along the tuber and ramus of the ischium and ramus of the pubis, and a little below the symphysis pubis divides intb two branches. In the pelvis the pudic at first gives small branches to the ad- joining viscera ; as it is passing round the spine of the ischium, and between the sciatic ligaments, it gives small branches to the surrounding ligaments and mus- cles; when it has re-entered the pelvis it gives off, 1st, external hcemorrhoidal arteries, two or three, they pass transversely to the side of the rectum and anus, and supply the integuments and muscles in that region; 2nd, the perinceal artery first descends, then turns for- wards and upwards round the transversus perinaei, pro- ceeds along the perinaeum, and is distributed to the muscles and integuments in this situation, and to the scrotum; 3rd, transversalis perincei, a small branch arising near to and often from the preceding;^ it takes the course of the muscle of that name, and is lost in the muscles and integuments; 4th, artery of the bulb, passes transversely between the layers of the triangular ligament, enters the spongy substance of the bujb, and spreads its branches through the corpus spongio- sum urethrae; 5th ariA Qtb ^T^tery of the corpus caverno- sum and dorsalis penis ; the former enters and extends along the corpus cavernosum, the latter along the dor- sum of the penis as far as the glans. In the female the pudic artery gives oft branches to the perinaeum and

194 and are four in number, two anterior and two lateral. We shall first consider the false Ugamenls, or the folds of the peritonaeum, which serve to connect the bladder to the pelvic viscera. The posterior ligaments ot the bladder are two in number, one on each side; they lead from the fore-part of the rectum to the back part of the bladder; each is of a semilunar forrn, its concavity looking forwards and upwards; in this fold are con- tained the ureter posteriorly, and the oWiteiated hy- pogastric artery anteriorly ; between the posterior liga- ments the qul desac of the peritonaeum descends, ihis membrane will be also found thrown into one or two semilunar folds on the posterior surface ot the bladder, provided this viscusbe in a state of contraction ; these disappear, however, when it becomes distended; hence it may be inferred, that these folds are designed to admit of the more easy distension of this organ. The lateral ligaments extend, one on each side, from the la- teral regions of the bladder to the iliac fossm; each contains in its duplicature the vas deferens in the ma e subject, and the ligamentum teres pf the uterus in the female. The superior ligament extends from tiie sum- mit of the bladder to the recti muscles; this portion of the peritonaeum is partially reflected over the i^mains of the urachus and of the hypogastric vessels. Detach the peritonaeum from the right iliac fossa, and gently draw the bladder and rectum from the pelvis, we shall then observe, that the neck and side of the former are retained in their situation by the reflection of a strong fascia (the pelvic fascia) from die parietes of the pelvis upon this viscus ; these reflections are the true liga- ments of the bladder. The pelvic foscia m?iy be con. sidered as a continuation ot the ihac fiiscia; it de- scends from behind the iliac vessels and from the brim of the pelvis, to which it adheres, and lines the pari- etes of the cavity as low down as the upper edge, or Uie origin of the levator ani muscle; here the pelvic fascia divides into two laminae, between which this mus- cle is enclosed : the external lamina is named the ob- turator fascia, the internal the vesical fascia. Ihe ob- turator fascia descends between the and levator uni muscles, adhering very closely to the

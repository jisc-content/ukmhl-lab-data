286 mity of the corpus callosum ; the middle is cineritious, and arises from one of the posterior convolutions of the anterior lobe; the three filaments soon unite and form a triangular swelling, from which the nerve pro- ceeds forwards and inwards for about two inches, in a groove in the anterior lobe, in which it is protected from pressure; it then ends in a soft oval bulb which is placed over the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone; from this several fine filaments descend through the foramina in this bone, and are distributed to the mucous membrane in the nose. The olfactory differ from the other cerebral nerves in figure, course, and structure ; prismatic or triangular, the apex is imbed- ded in the cerebrum; they converge as they leave the cranium; they consist of several striae, some white, others grey, all very soft; they are not surrounded by arachnoid membrane, but lie above it; they have no distinct sheath, and each ends in a soft grey swelling from which the ultimate filaments proceed, and which leave the cranium by a number of foramina. The SECOND PAIR or optic are large, soft, and flat posteriorly; round and enclosed in a dense neuri- lema anteriorly, each arises by two bands, one from the natis, the other from the testis; these pass out- wards beneath the optic thalamus, the first joins the corpus geniculatum externum, the second the corpus geniculatum internum ; these roots then unite in a soft flat band, which turns forwards in a semicircular course {tractus opticus) around the crus cerebri, to which it has a slight attachment, and from which it receives a few fibres; the optic nerves then converge, and unite before the sella turcica, in the optic commissure; in this flat, white, square substance, which is connected to and receives additional fibres from the tuber cine- reum, the two nerves are so confounded that the direc- tion of each is indistinct, and it is uncertain whether they decussate in whole or in part; from the commis- sure each nerve passes forwards and outwards on the inner side of the carotid and above the ophthalmic ai- tery, through the optic foramen, into the orbit; it is then surrounded by a process of dura mater, and pro- ceeding to the back part of the eye, it perforates the

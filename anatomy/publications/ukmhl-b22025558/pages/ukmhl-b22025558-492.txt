There is much difficulty experienced in distinguishing inflammation of this membrane from its natural state; tins depends on tbe great number of small vessels wbich natural!}' ramify on it; however, in- the inflamed state they become much more numerous, and by their anastomosis, make a beautiful reticulated ap- pearance, not however causing such a general redness as may be observed in the inflammation of some other membranes; and when the inflammation runs high, pu^ is formed whigh is eft'used on the whole upper surface of the brain. Next in order to inflammation, tbe most common morbid appearance found in the pia mater is tbe formation of small cysts, containing water, which are generally called hydatids; these are found more usually on tbe choroid plexus, and in the velum inter, positum. hijiammation of the substance of the brain is occasionally observed arising from external injury; the redness, which is generally slight, is confined to one par- ticular part; in this state, when cut into, the colour ap- pears to arise from a great many small vessels which are filled with red blood ; the inflamed part is softer and more yielding than natural, giving rise to an appear- ance wbich has been lately described by French writers, and called " ramollissement’’; when the inflammation pro- ceeds further, abscesses holding pus are formed, which, if of a large size, breakdown the substance of the brain, and present a very jagged appearance on their internal surface. Apoplexy, an effusion of blood either on the surface or in the substance of the brain, is also to be met with, and occasionally into some of tbe ventricles, iiroducing the disease called apoplexy ; the blood found m those situations is almost always coagulated ; however', when the person has long survived the apoplectic attack, the coagulated blood appears to be taken up by absorption, and its place supplied by a fluid of an al- buminous nature. Hydroccphahis. This is one of the most common affections of the brain; in this disease, water is found accumulated in the ventricles, amount- ing to a few ounces, or to so many pints ; tbe water, by raising up the anterior part of the fornix passes from

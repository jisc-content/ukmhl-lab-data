282 alongthe aqueduct of Sylvius, divide the valve of Vieus- sens and the cavity of i\\e fourth ventricle will be ex- posed ; this is directed obliquely downwards and back- wards, between the cerebrum, cerebellum, and medulla oblongata; it is bounded anteriorly by the pons Ya- rolii, in the median line of which is a narrow fissure, the calamus scriptorius, from eacli side of which a few white lines pass off'to join the auditory nerve; laterally by the processes from the testes and by the crura cere- belii; superiorly by the valve of Vieussens; posteriorly by the cerebellum, and inferiorly by the reflection of the arachnoid membrane, and of the pia mater from the inferior surface of the cerebellum to the back ot the spinal cord ; the pia mater is here peculiarly dense, and it sends a small process into the lower part ot this cavity, (the choroid plexus of the fourth ventricle,) which is loaded with tortuous vessels, and frequently presents a small number of reddish granular bodies. Raise either hemisphere of the cerebrum ; from its inferior surface, just below the corpus striatum and the optic thalamus, a thick, white fasciculus may be observed descending obliquely backwards and inwards; this is the crus cerebri; fibrous and white on the sur- face, each crus internally contains cineritious substance of a very dark colour (/ocms niger ;') the crura cerebri converge as they descend, and end in the upper extre- mity of the pons Varolii; the third ventricle is between them, and the tractus opticus of each side surrounds them. The crura cerebri and the following substance can be better examined when the brain is removed from the subject, and the base placed uppermost. The pons Varolii is somewhat square, it is placed obliquely on the cuneiform process, between the cerebrurii and cerebellum; the fourth ventricle, the aqueduct ol Syl- vius and the tubercula quadrigemina, are on its supe- rior and posterior surface; its inferior and anterior sur- face rests on the bone, and is grooved longitudinally by the basilar artery; its superior extremit) receives the crura cerebri, which it surrounds like a ring, hence it is sometimes called the annular protuberance; the crura cerebelli are attached to its sides, and the me-

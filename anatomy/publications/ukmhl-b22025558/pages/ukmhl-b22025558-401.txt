391 PART lY. DISSECTION OF THE JOINTS. W HEN all the muscles, vessels, nerves, &c. have been dissected, the student may examine the ana- tomy of the joints: in almost every articulation we find a smooth and delicate membrane extended over the articulating surface of each bone; this is termed a synovial membrane, it forms a shut sac like a serous membrane, and constantly contains a small quantity of a glairy fluid, termed synovia; this mem- brane is generally protected externally by liga- ments, which also serve to connect the bones to- gether ; these ligaments are termed capsular when they surround the joint, as in the shoulder and hip ; when they are confined to a particular part they are termed accessory ligaments, or lateral, anterior, pos- terior, &c. &c. TEMPORO-MAXILLARY ARTICULATIONS. Each condyle of the inferior maxilla is received into that portion of the glenoid cavity of the temporal bone which is anterior to the fissure, it also moves on the transverse root of the zygoma; this joint is strenc^then- ed by the external and internal lateral and the'stylo- maxillary ligaments, an inter-articular cartilage, two synovial membranes, and an imperfect capsular lijia- raent. ' The external lateral ligament arises broad from the zygomatic process of the temporal bone, descends ob- liquely back, and is inserted narrow into the outer side of the neck of the condyle of the lower jaw.

470 the subscapular tendon; between these tubercles is the deep groove for the long tendon of the biceps, into the anterior edge of which the tendon of tlie great pectoral is inserted, and into its posterior those of the teres major and latissirnus dorsi, this groove leads downwards and inwards. The body or shaji of the humerus is thick and round above, twisted in tbe middle, expanded and somewhat triangular inferiorly; its posterior surface is round above and twisted a little inwards, below it looks outwards and is flat and broad; this surface is covered by and gives attachment to the triceps muscle, a small vascular foramen may be observed about the centre; the anterior surface is divided for about one-fourth of its length by the bicipital groove into two unequal por- tions, the internal of which is smooth, and pre.sents near its centre a linear elevation for the insertion of the cora- cobrachialis, in the lower part of which is an oblique vas- cular foramen; the external portion is rough above tor the insertion of the deltoid muscle, and is grooved obliqely below for ibe passage of the musculo-spiral nerve and artery; these surfaces are separated by two prominent lines, one is external and anterior, the other IS internal and posterior, these lines are more distinct below than above, they give attachment to the inter- muscular ligaments and lead down to either condyle, the external is interrupted about the middle by the musculo-spiral groove, but is very prominent below, curved forwards and gives attachment to the brachiaeus anticus, the supinators and extensors, the .triceps and the external intermuscular ligament; on the anterior surface of the humerus there is also a prominent line continued from the anterior edge of the bicipital groove, it is gradually flattened below and covered by the brachiaeus anticus muscle. The Zoiuer extremity of the humerus is flattened, elongated transversely and twisted a little forwards, it presents internally the in- ternal condyle which is very prominent and turned somewhat backwards, this gives attachment to the com- mon tendon of the pronators and flexors, and to the internal lateral ligament of the elbow joint, externally is the external condyle, not so prominent as the internal, and situated lower dowm, it gives attachment to the

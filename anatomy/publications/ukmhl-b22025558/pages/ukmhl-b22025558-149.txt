139 to UifFerent portions of one extensive aponeurosis; as tlie iliac and transverse fasciae are continued one into the other, external to tlie iliac artery, a white line may be observed ; this is the circumflex ilii arterv enclosed in a sort of canal between these fasciae and Poupart’s ligament, to which these aponeuroses are united. file student should next consider how the space, commonly called the crural arch, is naturally filled; that portion of it between the spine of the ilium and the iliac or femoral artery is occupied by the psoas and iliac muscles; imbedded between these muscles is the anterior crural nerve; on the pubic side of these mus- cles is the femora] artery, next to which is the femoral vein, and at a little distance to the pubal side of this vessel is Gimbernaut’s ligament, which closes the inter- nal part of this space ; thus, almost all the crural arch IS Elled, except a small portion between the femoral vein and the third insertion of Poupart’s ligament; this space is ihefemoral or crural ring; this is somewhat of a triangular form, the base, externally, is the femoral vein, the apex internally is Gimbernaut’s ligament; it is bounded anteriorly by Poupart’s ligament, and by the superior fibres of tlie falcil'orm process of the fascia lata, and posteriorly by the pubis, covered by the pec- tinasal m uscle, and by die pectinasal portion of the fascia lata. Gimbernaut’s ligament prevents femoral hernia occurring internal to this space, which is the onlv part in the crural arch where a hernia can descend, and even here this accident is in a great degree guarded againstj as a lymphatic gland generally occupies this situation, aWl a layer of condensed cellular membrane extends across the opening; this layer is named ihe fascia propria ; this fascia, though weak and indistinct in the natural and ealthy state, becomes very thick and strong in cases of old femoral hernia; the fascia propria may be described as arising thin and delicate from the fascia iliaca on the external side of the iliac vessels; passing over these vessels it descends internally into the pelvis; inferiorly It 13 continued along these vessels to Poupart’s li<ra. ment, covers the femoral ring, and then ascendinc is lost on the inner surface of the fascia transversalis. rural hernia cannot occur external to the rin^^, as

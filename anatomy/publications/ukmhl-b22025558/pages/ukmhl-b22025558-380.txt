370 flexor muscles, and to the skin j 5tb, dorsalis carpi ulnaris turns round the lower end of tlie ulna, and spreads its branches on the back part of the wrist and hand; 6th, superjicialpalmar, i'oxms the palmar arcli, bends obliquely across the palm of the hand towards the thumb, and inosculates with branches of the radial artery ; 7th, ramus profundus, passes beneath the flexor tendons, crosses the 6th and 4th metacarpal bones, and joins the deep palmar branch of the radial artery, and thus completes the deep palmar arch ; from the super- ficial arch long digital branches pass, these divide and supply the opposite sides of all the fingers, except the radial side of the index finger and the thumb. The radial artery continues in the direction of the brachial artery; it passes along the radial side of the fore-arm to the wrist, turns round the external lateral ligament of this joint, then passes forwards between the heads of the two first metacarpal bones into the palm of the hand, and terminates in three branches ; in the fore-arm it is covered by the skin and fascia only, lies between the supinator longus externally, and the pro- nator teres, and flexor carpi radialis internally; it passes over the biceps, supinator brevis, pronator teres, flexor digitorum sublimis, flexor pollicis, and pronator quadratus; it is accompanied by two veins, and the ra- dial nerve is to its external side in the middle of the fore-arm ; on the outer side of the wrist it is'covered by the extensor tendons of the thumb, and on the back of the hand by the skin and fascia, it gives of, 1st, ra- dial recurrent, large and tortuous, bends outwards and upwards along the supinators and extensors, to which it sends several branches, and inosculates with the supe- rior profunda ; 2d, muscular branches to the flexors and supinators ; 3d, superficialis voice passes over the an- nular ligament of the carpus, supplies the small muscles of the thumb, and inosculates with the ulnar artery : 4th, dorsalis carpi radialis; 5th, dorsales pollicis, these branches are distributed as their names imply; 6th, ra- dialis indicis, runs along the radial side of the fore- finger; 7th, magna pollicis runs along the 1st metacar- pal bone, and divides into two branches, which pass along the opposite sides of the thumb to its last pha-

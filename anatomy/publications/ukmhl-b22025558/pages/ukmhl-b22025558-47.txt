37 and broad, is connected to the epiglottis and palate by inucous membrane, and to the os hyoides and infe- rior maxilla by muscles; the apex is thin and unat- tached ; that portion between it and the base is named the body of the tongue; all the upper surface, the sides, and about one third of its inferior surface, are covered by raucous membrane, which is very rough superiorly, from the number of papillae that project through it; anteriorly, these papillae are small, conical, and con- nected with the terminations of the nerves of taste; posteriorly they are large, round, lenticular, and very irregular; these are small glands which open on the mucous surface: near the epiglottis these glandular papillae are often observed to have a peculiar arrange- ment, like the letter v, the concavity turned forwards; behind the apex of this angle, a deep depression (fora- men ccecum) is observable; this contains some mucous follicles; a superficial groove runs along the dorsum of the tongue, one more distinct exists along the inferior surface, so that this organ is divided by the mesial line into two symmetrical portions ; accordingly, in para- lysis, one side only of this organ is frequently found affected.* The substance of the tongue is composed of adeps blended with numerous muscular fibres de- rived from the stylo, hyo, genio-hyo-glossi, and lingua- les muscles, and of many other fleshy fibres which do not properly belong to any of these : two large arteries (lingual) and six considerable nerves (the gustatory, the lingual and the glosso-pharyngeal, on each side) supply this organ. The tongue is not only the organ of taste, but by its great mobility it assists in speech, in suction and deglutition ; the fifth pair of nerves endow the tongue with sensation and with the sense of taste, the ninth with mobility, and the eighth connect its motions with those of the pharynx and stomach, * In hemiplegia, when the muscles of one side of the face are pa- ralysed, it has been remarked, that if the tongue be protruded, the apex will be directed towards the affected side, this phenomenon, which is only an apparent exception, depends on the action of the genio-byo-glossus muscle of the healthy side ; which will pull the base of the tongue on that side, towards the chin, and must therefore torn the point to the opposite side.

446 to form part of the lachrymal fossa and duct; its inter- nal surface forms part of the nasal fossa, and is connect- ed to the ethmoid bone above, below this is a channel that leads to the middle meatus, and inferior to this is a crest for the spongy bone ; between the nasal and ma- lar processes is the orbital plate, of a triangular form, the base joined to the etlxmoid, lachrymal and palate bones ; this process looks downwards and forwards ; its outer and posterior edge bounds the spheno-maxillary fissure ; the infra-orbital canal, which runs along it in a direction forwards and inwards, lodges the vessels and nerves of that name ; this canal divides anteriorly into two, the smaller is the aytterior dental, which descends in the anterior wall of the antrum, where it terminates by communicating with the anterior alveoli, the other or tlie proper infra orbital canal is wider, and ends in the infra-orbital hole; the edge of the bone above this liole is round to form part of the contour of the orbit, behind which the inferior oblique muscle of the eye arises ; behind and below this plate is the tuberosity, this is more prominent in the young, as it contains the last molar tooth, after the protrusion of which it diminishes, near this are three or four small holes, the posterior dental canals which lead to the posterior alveoli; be- neath the orbital plate, the body of the bone is exca- vated into a large cavity, the antrum highmorianuni, ot somewhat a triangular figure, the base towards the nose, the apex towards the malar process ; this is the largest sinus connected with the nose, it is sometimes divided by septa as wâ€™ell as by the anterior dental canal into two or more cells; the intra-prbilal canal runs along itsioof, through the floor, one or two ot the molar alveoli pro- ject and sometimes open, the canine fossa is in front of It, and the tuber bounds it behind, this cavity is lined by the membrane of the nosp ; in the skeleton the opening in its base is very large and irregular, but in the natural slate it is contracted by the ethmoid bone above, by tlie palate bone behind, and by the inferior spongy bone below, also by the lining membrane of the nose ; it opens by one or two small oblique openings into the ond- dle meatus of the nose, anterior to which is the in/un- dibuhm, a deep groove leading downwards, bacK.wards, and inwards, from the frontal sinus and the anterior

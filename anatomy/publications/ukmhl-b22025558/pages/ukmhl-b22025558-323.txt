313 t\yo branches, external and internal; the external is distributed to the sterno and hyo-thyroid, and to the o ler sLipeificial muscles, also to the thyroid gland and to the cartilages of the larynx ; the internal perforates he thyro-hyoKl membrane and divides into numerous lancies, many of these go to the anterior surface of the epiglottis, to the glands and mucous membrane the arytenoid glands and muscle., ; one long filament descends obliquely forwards along the side of the larynx beneath the thyroid carti- age and supplies the cnco-thyroid muscle. As the vagus descends it frequently gives off fine filaments to e carotid artery, and to unite with the sympathetic and with the cervical nerves; a little above the arteria t.rh ! cardiac nerves from the sym- pathetic ; the nerve of the left side does not send off so many or sucji large branches as that on the right terv\n?t‘ carotid ar- ioin h over it, and then join the cardiac plexus.

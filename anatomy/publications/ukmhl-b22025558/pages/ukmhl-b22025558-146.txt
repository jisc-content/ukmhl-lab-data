136 number, larger than the former, and placed perpendicu- larly or parallel to the saphena vein ; in general one lies behind this vessel; the deep inguinal glands are beneath the fascia lata, are three or four in number, and are closely connected to the sheath of the femoral vessels, chiefly to its inner side; in general one occupies the femoral ring. The Saphena vein is the principal cuta- neous vein of the lower extrimity; it will be seen in a future dissection to arise from the dorsum and inner side of the foot, and to ascend in front of the inner ankle along the inner side of the leg, and passing behind the inner condyle of the femur it continues to ascend along the inner and anterior part of the thigh to within about two inches of Poupart’s ligament, when it passes through an opening in the fascia lata (the saphenic opening) and joins the femoral vein. The saphenic opening in the fascia lata will be very distinctly seen if the vein be di- vided on the thigh and raised towards Poupart’s liga- ment, it presents a well marked semilunar edge, the con- cavity looking upwards; the edge, though apparently sharp, yet if carefully examined will be found reflected backwards on the sheath of the femoral vessels; remove the inguinal glands, clean the surface of the fascia lata, to the connexions of which in this region the student should next attend. The fascialata may be observed to be united to the spine of the ilium, to the whole length of Poupart’s ligament, also to the linea innominata and spine of the Pubis; it covers the muscles on either side of the groin, and the vessels in the middle : for the purpose of more particular examination, this fascia may be divided into three portions, the internal or pubic or pectineal portion, the external or iliac, and the middle or cribriform ; the internal or puhic portio7i covers the pec- linaeus, gracilis, and adductor muscles, and is inserted internally into the ramus of the ischium and pubis; su- periorly into the linea inominata or ileo-pectinea, ante- rior to Gimbernaut’s ligament; exteimally it passes be- hind the sheath of the femoral vessels, and at the edge of the psoas tendon divides into two laminre, one passes be- neath that tendon, and is attached to the capsular ligament of the hip-joint; the other passes over that tendon and is continued into the deep surface of the fascia iliaca.

60 forwards and downwards ; hence the perpendicular di- ameter of the thorax is much greater posteriorly than it is behind the sternum. The apex of the thorax is somewhat truncated, and presents an oval opening lono’cr transversely than from before backwards ; this, the superior orifice of the thorax, is bounded anteriorl]r by the upper edge of the sternum and interclavicular Ii- wament, posteriorly by the last cervical and first dorsal vertebr®, and laterally by the first rib : the several im- portant parts which pass through this opening shall be noticed afterwards. The inferior circumference ot tlie thorax is five or six times more extensive than the supe- rior ; it is bounded by the xiphoid, the last true and al the false costal cartilages, and by the last dorsal and first lumbar vertebrin ; its longer diameter is also trans- verse. Open the cavity by dividing the cartilages ot the ribs on each side of the sternum, and raising t le latter from below upwards ; if we look under the ster- num as we thus slowly raise it, we perceive that space called anterior mediastinum to be gradually developed, from the right and left pleurae separating from each other as we tear the loose cellular membrane which na- turally connects the pleurae and pericardium to the pos- terior surface of the bone: when the sternum is re- moved this region is fully exposed; it is described as being of a triangular form, the base, the steinum the sides, the pleurae, converging behind so as touch each other; the apex, the small portion of peri- cardium left uncovered by the pleurae ; naturally, how- ever, all the parts within the thorax are so closely ap- Sed to the parietes, that no space or cavity of a de- fined form, like that assigned to the anterior mediasti- num can truly be said to exist. The dissector, how. ever’ may cause this space to appear more distinct by "hf roTowing precaution : before you divide the carti- lages push your fingers from the abdomen behind the sternum and break down the cellular connexions be- tween it’and the pleurae, then cut the cartilages very near the sternum, and raise the latter; caution before dividing the cartilages, the pleura, par Saidy the right, will be in almost every instance laid jpen, aid so the appearance of the anterior mediastinum

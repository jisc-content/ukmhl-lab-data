197 and in either sex occasionally to the convolutions of the small intestines; all this region is covered by peri- tonaeum. 6th, The inferior region, in the female, lies on the ureters and on the vagina; in the male, on the vesiculte seminales, the intervening cul de sac of peri- tonaeum, the i ectum and the prostate gland; the superior and posterior part of this region is covered by the peri- tonaeum , but anterior to the line of the reflection of this membrane, from the bladder to the rectum, is the triangular portion of this region, in which the perito- naeum is deticient, and which has been already attended to, as the situation in which the operation of tappino- the bladder from the rectum may be performed. ^ ■ The coats ot the bladder are four, viz, 1st, the serous or peritonaeal; 2d, the muscular ; 3d, the cellular • 4th, the mucous : the serous is but a partial coat, it covers all the posterior surface, the posterior part of the upper and lower fundus; also the posterior part of each side. All the anterior region, the fore-part of the srdes, and of the upper and lower regions, are therefore uncovered by peritonaeum ; when the bladder is dis- tended there is more of this organ in proportion co- ^red by this membrane than in its contracted stale _lhe peritonaeal covering of the bladder is very dense* It may be easily dissected off the following. 2d, the muscular coat consists of fibres which are strontrer and redder than the muscular fibres on any of thS other hollow viscera ; they take different directions ; those of the superficial layer run chiefly in a longitudinal direc- tion, are connected anteriorly and inferiorly to the an- terior ligaments of the bladder, and superiorly to the urachus, posteriorly and inferiorly to the base of the prostate gland; these fibres are stronger on the ante nor and posterior surfaces than on the sides of the blad- dcr; on the latter regions they run obliquely. The an- grier fibres, from havinga fixed attachment, are called by some the detrusor urince muscle: the deep fibres mostly take a circular direction, are weak superiorly Jut strong near the cervix, where they are supposed to act as a sphincter muscle; these circular fibres which have received this name, maybe more distinctly .seen

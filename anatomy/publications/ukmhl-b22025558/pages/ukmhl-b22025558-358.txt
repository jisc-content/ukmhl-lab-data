348 The Lachrymal sac is a small oval pouch of mucous membrane, closed above and leading below' into the nasal duct, it is situated in a fossa formed by the max- illary and unguis bones, covered by the integuments, the tendon and some fleshy fibres of the orbicularis muscle, also by a strong fascia which is derived from that tendon and connected to the surrounding bony margin. A small muscle has been described by Mr. Horner as arising from the edge of the os unguis, and inserted into the lachrymal sac and ducts ; he conceives it to have the power of compressing the sac, and direct- ing the ducts and their contents towards it; it is not however in all subjects to be distinguished from the orbicular, which last can effect the purpose ascribed to this small muscle. The Nasal Duct (about three-fourths of an inch in lenwih in the recent state) descends from the sac ob- liquely backwards and a little outwards, surrounded by the maxillary, unguis, and inferior spongy bones ; be- neath the latter it opens by a small slit-like orifice, which is surrounded by a circular fold of mucous mem- brane, into the lower meatus, about an inch trom the anterior part of the naris; this duct is formed of mu- cous membrane only, it is connected to the periosteum. The nerves and vessels of the orbit have been already examined. The nerves of the palpebrae are derived from the portio dura of the 7th, from the lachrymal, frontal, and nasal branches of the ophthalmic, and from the infra-orbital branches of the 5th pair of nerves ; the vessels are branches of the ophthalmic, temporal, and facial. DISSECTION OF THE GLOBE OF THE EVE. It will facilitate the student in learning the anatomy of the eye, to dissect this organ in some of the inferior animals; almost every part of importance may be exa- mined with equal advantage in the eye of the sheep, ox, or pig, as in that of the human subject; many ot the minute parts are even on a larger scale, and can be dissected with greater ease: we also have it in our

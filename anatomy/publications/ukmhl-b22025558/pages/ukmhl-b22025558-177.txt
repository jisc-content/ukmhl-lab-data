167 vessel in the pancreatic duct; this is named the lesser jiancreas. The pancreatic fluid is supposed to be of use in diluting the bile, and rendering it and the con- tents of the duodenum more miscible with each other. The structure of the pancreas is similar to that of the salivary glands, and is thence called by some, the ab- dominal salivary gland. OF THE VESSELS AND NERVES OF THE ABDOMEN. The abdominal aorta gives off three large branches to supply the organs of digestion, viz. the cceliac axis, the superior mesenteric and inferior mesenteric arteries. Tlie cceliac axis may be seen by tearing through the les- ser omentum above the lesser curvature of the stomach to arise from the forepart of the aorta, at the upper ed<^e of the pancreas; it is about half an inch long, and divid*es into three branches, viz. the gastric, hepatic and splenic • tlie gastric artery and its branches run between the la- minae of the lesser omentum, along the concave ed<re of die stomach, and supply both surfaces of this organ, ihe artery accompanies the vena porta and the biliary duct to the transverse fissure of the liver first sending oft a small branch’to the pylorus Cnvlo- nflt-^ large branch (gastro-duode- na i3,) which descends behind the pylorus and subdi- vides into two branches, the pancreatico-duodenalis and gastro epiploica dextra; the former supplies the pancreas and duodenum; the latter runs along the con- vex edge of the stomach, between the layers of the great omentum ; the hepatic artery then divides into the right aid left hepatic arteries, which supply the riaht and left lobes of the liver; the right hepatic is The i''tena cystica, to le gall bladder. '[ he splenic artery is the longest and argest branch of the cceliac axis; it passes along the ifpcr and posterior part of the pancreas, to whfch it gives many branches; near the spleen it sends off the gastro-epiploica sinistra, which runs along the convex t ge of the stomach, between the layers of the great omentum ; the splenic artery then divides into five or

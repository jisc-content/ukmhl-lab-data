392 Tlie internal lateral ligament is thinner and longer than the external, it arises narrow from the spinous pro- cess of the sphenoid bone, descends obliquely forwards and is inserted broad into the orifice of the inferior dental canal. The stylo-maxillary ligament is a thin aponeurosis, arises from the styloid process of the temporal bone, passes forwards and outwards; is connected to the cervical fascia, and to the stylo-glossus muscle, and is inserted into the angle of the lower maxilla, between the masseter and internal pterygoid muscles, and the parotid and sub-maxillary glands. The synovial membranes, one covers the cartilagi- nous surface of the zygomatic eminence and the gle- noid cavity, and is reflected over the upper surface of the inter-articular cartilage: the other, which is smaller, covers the under surface of the inter-articular cartilage, and is reflected over the condyle ; these sacs have no communication with each other. The inter-articular Jibro-cartilage is of an oval figure, thick in its circumference, thin in the centre. Its upper surface is adapted to the articular eminence and glenoid cavity, and its lower surface to the con- dyle. Some fibres of the external pterygoid are at- tached to its forepart, the external lateral ligament also adheres to it: sometimes there is a hole in the centre of it. The capsular ligament consists of dense fibres which arise from the Zygomatic eminence and from the gle- noid fissure, as they descend they adhere to the interar- ticular cartilage, and are inserted into the neck of the lower jaw ; this ligament is deficient anteriorly, at the insertion of the external pterygoid muscle. â–  ARTICULATION OF THE OCCIPUT WITH THE ATLAS AND AXIS. The condyles of the occipital bone are received into the superior oblique processes of the atlas, and are attached by imperfect capsular ligaments, by synovial membranes which cover the opposed cartilaginous sur- faces, and by an anterior and posterior ligament which

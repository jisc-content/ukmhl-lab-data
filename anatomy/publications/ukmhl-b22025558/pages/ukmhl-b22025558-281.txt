271 at the exit of each; thus the arachnoid membrane, like all serous membranes, forms a shut sac, one side or layer of it (the parietal) adhering to the dura mater; the other (the visceral) covering the brain and extend- ing from one eminence to another, without penetrating between them ; it is smooth, polished, and transparent, without any distinct vessels; it exhales and again abÂ» sorbs a fine serous halitus which allows the opposed sur- faces to move against each other without friction ; this membrane is also continued into the cavities or ventri- cles of the brain, and gives to them a smooth lining. To see this process of the arachnoid membrane, separate gently the posterior lobes of the cerebrum, divide the falx, and at the anterior edge of the tentorium the two vense Galeni will be seen entering the straight sinus; these veins are surrounded by the serous membrane; press these gently to one side, and underneath them a small round hole or canal may be observed, leading forwards below these veins, and above the pineal gland, and opening into the back part of the third ventricle; this canal is lined by the arachnoid membrane, which is continued from that on the surface of the brain, and expands within the ventricles, so as to cover all the inequalities observed within them ; this arachnoid canal, or the canal of Bichat, will be noticed again in the examination of the ventricles. The third tunic of the brain is the vascular coat, or the pia mater, of a very soft and delicate structure, loaded with numerous fine vessels; it adheres to the whole surface of the brain, and following every involution of its surface, it is intimately united with its substance by numerous shred? and vessels, which admit of being drawn out like fine threads; on the convolutions of the brain it is insepa- rably connected to the arachnoid membrane, but in most other situations, particularly at tlie base of the brain, they are but loosely united to each other. The pia mater is also prolonged into the lateral ventricles, through an extensive fissure, which will be seen in the dissection of the brain between the fornix and the cor- pus callosum above, and the tubercula quadrigemina and pons Varolii below ; this fissure descends obliquely forwards on each side into the inferjpr corni) of each

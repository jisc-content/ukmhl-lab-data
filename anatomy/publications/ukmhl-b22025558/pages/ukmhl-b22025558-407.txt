397 superiorly, where the thyroid nerve and vessels pass tlirough. STERNO-CLAVICULAK ARTICULATION. Ihe clavicle is connected to the sternum by an an- terior, posterior, inferior, and inter-clavicular ligament, also by an inter-articular cartilage and two synovial mem- branes ; the anterior ligament arises from the end of the clavicle, descends inwards, and is inserted into the fore-part ot the sternum ; the posterior ligament takes a course parallel to the preceding, behind the joint ; the infetior or the costo-clavictdar or rhomboid ligament, passes from the lower surface of the sternal end ot the clavicle, and is inserted into the cartilage of the first rib ; the inler-clavicular extends from the posterior surface of one clavicle to the other, the cer- vical fascia is attached to the upper edge of this liga- ment ; the inter-articidar cartilage is thin below, and attached to the sternum, thick above and attached to the clavicle; a synovial membrane is connected to each surface of this cartilage. SCAPULO-CLAVICULAR ARTICULATION. The oval end of the clavicle is connected to the end of the acromion process by a superior and inferior ligament, which are attached to the surfaces of each bone, there is also a synovial membrane between both; sometimes there is an inter-articular cartilage in this articulation ; about an inch internal to this joint the clavicle is con- nected to the coracoid process by two fasciculi of liga- rnentous fibres, which do not properly belong to this*ar- ticulation, they are the conoid and trapezoid ligaments. Ihe conoid is the smaller of the two, its base is at- tached to a tubercle on the lower surface of the clavi- cle, its apex to the broad part of the coracoid process. trapezoid is more anterior and external, it is also broader and stronger than the conoid, it is about an inch distant from the articulation, it is attached above to an oblique line on the clavicle, and below to the up- per part of the coracoid process ; these ligaments arc M M

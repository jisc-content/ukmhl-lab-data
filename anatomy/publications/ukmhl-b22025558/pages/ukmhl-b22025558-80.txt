70 the left ventricle, which then propels it into the aorta, through whose branches it is conveyed to all parts of the body, whence it is again returned to the heart by the veins. The superior vena cava is seen descending obliquely forwards and inwards within the pericardium, and joining the upper and back part of the right auri- cle. Of the inferior cava but a short portion is seen within the pericardium; this vessel lies on a plane pos- terior to the superior cava, and passing obliquely up- wards, backwards, and inwards, joins the lower and back part of the right auricle. Between these two veins the right auricle is situated; it is somewhat square, its posterior part, between the two cavae, is called the sinus: the anterior loose portion, the auricular appendix or process ; the right auricle is connected interiorly to the right ventricle, and partl)'^ rests on the diaphragm ; on the right side it is free, and on the left it is connected to the left auricle; lay open this cavity by a perpendi- cular incision from the superior down to within half an inch of the inferior cava, from the centre of this make a transverse cut towards the anterior part of the auri- cle, wash out the blood, and we may then observe at the back part of the sinus the openings of the two cava, and between these a slight projection, tuhercidum Lovoeri; and in the auricular appendix the muscular fibres called musculi peclinati. We can also now per- ceive that the left or internal side of the auricle is formed by a thin sheet of membranous and muscular substance ; this is the septum auricularum ; on the in- ferior part of this we may observe a depression, the fossa ovalis, immediately above the inferior cava, and surrounded in part by a thick lip, named its annulus; at the upper and deeper part of this fossa we frequently find a small oblique passage leading into the left auricle, its obliquity, however, prevents any communication taking place during life: in the foetus before birth this was a free opening, the foramen ovale, between the two auricles ; anterior to the opening ot the inferior cava, we observe the semilunar fold ot the lining membrane, \.\\e Eustachian valve : this valve Is connected by its con- vex edge to the angle between the vein and auricle ; its concave edge is loose, and looks backwards and to

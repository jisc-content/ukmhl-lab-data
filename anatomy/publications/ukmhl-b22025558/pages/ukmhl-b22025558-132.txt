and fascia from the surface of the abdominal muscles, and continue the dissection as far back as within two or three inches of the spine. In dissecting the external oblique muscle at its upper and anterior part, care must be taken not to raise its aponeurosis, which is so thin, as it passes over the anterior part of the thorax, that it may be mistaken for condensed cellular membrane. In order to expose the external oblique muscle, make its fibres tense by putting a block under the loins, and dis- sect in a line nearly parallel to its fibres; to clean the posterior portion, the subject should be turned a little to the opposite side. The abdominal muscles consist of five pair, viz. obliqui externi, and interni, transversales, recti, and pyraraidales. Obliquus Externus, or Descendens, broad, thin, and somewhat square, extends over the anterior and late- ral parts of the abdomen, fleshy above and behind, ten- dinous before and below; it arises by eight or nine tri- angular fleshy slips; sometimes there are only seven, from the eight or nine inferior ribs, at a little distance from their cartilages; the five superior indigitate with corresponding portions of the serratus magnus ; and the three inferior with those of the latissimus dorsi, by which they are a little overlapped. The superior fibres are thin, aponeurotic, and weak, and pass horizontally inwards ; a tendinous and fleshy slip often connects this portion to the great pectoral muscle; the middle are the longest, and descend obliquely forwards and inwards: the posterior are strong and fleshy, and descend almost vertically: the superior and middle fibres end in a broad tendon, which commences at a little distance external to tlie linea semilunaris; this tendon is continued over the forepart of the abdomen, covers the rectus muscle, and is so broad interiorly as to extend from one spine of the ilium to that of the opposite side; it is very strong inferiorly, but so very thin above, where it covers the thoracic portion of the rectus, that the inexperienced dissector often removes it along with the integuments. The external oblique is inserted tendinous into the ensi- form cartilage, linea alba, pubis, Pouparts ligament which is formed by this tendon, and into the anteiior superior spinous process of the ilium, also tendinous and

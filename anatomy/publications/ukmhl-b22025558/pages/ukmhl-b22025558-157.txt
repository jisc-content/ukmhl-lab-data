11-7 ing a very important and remarkably folded or plaited process named the mesentery. From the inferior sur- face of the mesentery the peritonaeum extends into either iliac region, and descends into the pelvis in the middle; it serves to connect the caecum in the right, and the sigmoid curve of the colon in the left iliac fossa; in the pelvis the peritonaeum descends around the rectum,forming the process named the meso-rectum; opposite the lower third of the sacrum, it is reflected to the lower and back part of the bladder, and in the fe- male to the upper and back part of the vagina, from which it ascends on the uterus, and forms on each side of this organ the broad ligament which supports the Fallopian tube and the ovary; the peritonaeum is then reflected from the fore-part of the uterus to the back ot the bladder, ascends, both in the male and female, along the posterior surface and sides of this viscus to its su- perior fundus, from which, and from the iliac fossae, it is continued to the abdominal muscles; forms the in- guinal pouches, and may then be traced on the inner surface of the recti and transverse muscles up to the umbilicus, where the sac was opened. The different folds which the peritonaeum forms in this course are termed processes, tlie principal of which, in addition to the ligaments of the several organs, which shall be no- ticed in the description of the latter, are, the lesser omentum, the great omentum, the splenic omentum, the colic omentum, the appendices epiploicae, the trans- verse, and the right and left lumbar meso-colons, the mesentery, meso-caecum, and meso rectum. The lesser or gastro-hepalic omentum consists of two laminae, which extend from the transverse fissure of the liver to the lesser curvature of the stomach and to the - upper part of the duodenum; it contains between its layers the vessels of the liver, viz. the hepatic artery to the left side, the ductus choledochus to the right, and the vena porta behind and between both; at its con- nexion to the stomach, it encloses the coronary vessels of this organ; the lesser omentum lies anterior to the foramen of Winslow; this omentum seldom contains much fat. The great or gastro-colic omentum also consists of two

509 gulus and os calcis. The fibula is broken usually at its lower third, and the broken end of this bone is situated on the astragalus. The synovial membrane is ruptured with laceration of the deltoid and anterior ligaments of the tibia, and of the posterior transverse band from the tibia to the fibula. After the accident has taken place, contraction of the gastrocnemii, solei and peronei muscles, by rotating the foot out and drawing it up- wards, will offer resistance to reduction. If the tibia be dislocated outwards, the malleolus internus must be bro- ken off: the deltoid ligament is not ruptured; but if the fibula be not broken, the external lateral, anterior and posterior ligaments of this bone are lacerated. In the forward dislocation, the fibula and usually the mal- leolus internus are broken. The tibia rests on the os naviculare and internal cuneiform bone. The posterior part of the deltoid ligament, and the transverse band from the tibia to the fibula are ruptured. Dislocation forwards is an accident of rare occurrence. It cannot happen when the foot is flexed on the tibia, for then the tibia sinks down on the back part of the astratrulns and nothing but considerable force could raise iTover the upper portion of the bone, which, in this position extends like a bridge before it. Luxation backwards is even still more rare. Were such an accident to take place all the tibial ligaments would be broken, and the fibula most probably frac- tured. * ^ The astragulus, the os cuneiform internum, and the range of tarsal bones articulated with the os calcis and astragulus, are sometimes dislocated simply, but the accident is of very rare occurrence. Dislocations of the phalanges of the toes are similar to those already described as taking place in the fingers, and do net de- serve particular notice. X X 2

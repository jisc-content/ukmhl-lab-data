353 The Retina may be best exposed by gently tearing off the choroid, (the eye being held under water,) and then placing an inverted glass globe filled with clear diluted spirits over the dissection, the retina will be- come sliuhtly opaque, and have a magnified appear- ance, The optic nerve having pierced the choroid coat ends in this thin and delicate membrane, which IS transparent in the very recent eye, but soon be- comes opaque after death ; the retina extends around the sides and fore-part of the vitreous humour without adhering to it, as far forwards as within two lines of the lens; here the nervous matter ends by an abrupt line, along which a small blood-vessel runs. The reti- na is divisible into three layers: first, lamina serosa; ^cond, lamina nervosa; and third, lamina vasculosa. Ihe e.\ternal or serous layer is extremely delicate, it may be separated by gentle pressure with the handle o the knife, under water. Tin's membrane was dis- covered by Dr. Jacob. The middle, or the nervous layer, is soft and grey, and continuous with the optic nerve ; the internal or vascular layer is very delicate • it lies on the vitreous humour, and is continued on its tore-part to the capsule of the lens, where it becomes adherent to the hyaloid membrane. Dissect off the posterior half of the retina from the vitreous humour or cut transversely a fresh eye, and allow the humours to laJl out, then look on the concave surfitce of the re- tina, and we may observe in the centre of the optic nerve a small dark point, ihe poms opticus; this is the central artery of the retina, which then spreads its branches in the internal layer of the retina ; about two ines external to this, and in the axis of the eye, is a srnall yellow or orange spot, the punclum aureum • the retina IS thrown into folds around this; some describe a perforation and deficiency of the retina at this spot It rather appears, however, to depend on some necu! bar organization. The humours of the eye are the aqueous, crystalline, and vitreous. ^ The acjueous humour is perfectly colourless, about five grams in quantity; it fills the anterior and poste nor chambers, the former about two lines, the^Jalter H H 2

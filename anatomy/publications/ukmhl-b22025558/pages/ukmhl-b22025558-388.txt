378 I at first internal, afterwards posterior to it; the anterior crural nerve is external to it, two or tliree of its branches are ver}' near it, above the middle of the thigh, one small nerve crosses the artery, and the saphenus nerve descends in its sheath along the fore-part of the vessel; it sends off, 1st, three or four superficial branches, \\z. i —inguinal Z»ranc/ies to the inguinal glands, &c. ; the superficial pudic, one or two in number, which pass towards the pubis and are lost in the integuments; the superficial epigastric, the longest and largest of these branches, ascends obliquely inwards towards the umbi- licus, parallel to the internal epigastric, and is lost in the integuments; the external circumjlex ilii extends along Poupart’s ligament to the crest of the ilium, where it terminates in the skin; 2nd, the profunda is the largest branch of the femoral, it arises about two inches below the crural arch, from the outer and back part of the femoral artery, bends a little outwards at first, then de- scends obliquely inwards and backwards behind the fe- moral artery, and the tendon of the adductor longus, passing over the psoas, cruraeus, and adductor brevis, at the back part of the thigh it terminates m two branches for the hamstring muscles ; m this course it ffives off the two circumflex, and the three perforating branches ; the external circumflex artery, arises from the cuter part of the profunda, passes transversely be- neath the sartorius and rectus muscles, and divides into three fasciculi of branches, superior, middle, and inte- rior, the first ascend along the tensor vaginae and glu- taeus medius muscles, and inosculate with the glut®a artery, the second pass round the bone to its back part, and inosculate with the glutaeal, sqiatic, and internal circumfiex arteries; the third are the longest and largest branches, they descend towards the knee tmd <!upplv the extensor muscles. The internal circumflex artery arises sometimes below, sometimes above the preceding, it often proceeds from the femoral itself. It passes backwards between the psoas and pectinaeus, along the obturator externus tendon, to tlie back part of the thigh, first sending olf several branches to the surrounding muscles, and to the hip joint, a so some to inosculate with the obturator artery ; at the back of the

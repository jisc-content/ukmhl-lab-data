277 iamus, externally by medullary substance; internally it is deficient of cerebral substance, and is closed by the arachnoid membrane; inferiorly by the hippocampus major and corpus fimbriatum: these several bodies, which are observed in the different regions of these cavities, must next be examined individually ; and first, the corpora striata. These pyriform bodies have their larger ends directed forwards and inwards; their pos- terior small and pointed extremities pass backwards and outwards ; smooth and unattached superiorly and internally, on all other sides they are continuous with the white substance ; vascular, soft, and cineritious on their surface; they will be found, when cut into, to consist of alternate laminte of grey and white sub- stance ; the latter may be traced from the crura cere- bri through these bodies to the upper and anterior part of the cerebrum, hence the corpora striata are named b}' some the anterior or superior ganglions of the cere- brum. The tania semi-circularis, a narrow, semitrans- parent band, whitish, fibrous, placed in the groove be- tween the optic thalamus and corpus striatum ; arises narrow from a tubercle on the back part of the optic thalamus, (corpus geniculatmn externum,) passes for- wards and inwards, becomes broader, and joins the de- scending pillar of the fornix ; the anterior portion has a resemblance to the cornea, and has been named lami- ria cornea ; several veins from the corpus striatum pass beneath the tienia to join the venre Galeni. The c/io- 10ld plexus is a fold of thin vascular membrane derived from the pia mater; it enters the inferior cornu between the optic thalamus and the taenia hippocampi; loose and floating it ascends obliquely backwards over the hippocampus major, then turns forwards between the thalamus and the fornix, beneath which it is connected to the choroid membrane, and ends by uniting with its • ellow in the foramen commune anterius; each choroid })lexus IS covered by the arachnoid membrane; they receive a number of veins from the parietes of the ven- tncles, particularly from the corpora striata; these veins loia the venae Galeni, whicli will be noticed presently • very frequently small vesicles, hydatids, and even small hard tumors may be found in these membranes.

419 wards, is very broad transversely, and presents in tlie middle an oval surface or body cut off obliquely from before backwards and upwards, and covered with car- tilage for articulation with the last lumbar vertebra, its anterior edge is named the promontory; behind this is the triangular aperture of the sacral or spinal canal, and on each side of it is a smooth convex surface (or transverse process) directed forwards and continuous with the iliac fosste ; on either side of the spinal hole is the oblique or articular process, concave, and looking backwards and inwards to receive the articular pro- cesses of the last lumbar vertebra; anterior to each is a groove, which contributes with the notch in the last vertebra to form the last of the holes of conjunction for the passage of the last of the lumbar spinal nerves, and behind the oblique processes are the laminae, which are sharp, and give attachment to the last of the liga- menta flava. The inferior extremity or apex is directed downwards, and presents a small oval convex surface to articulate with the coccyx, on each side of which is a small notch for the last sacral nerve ; the anterior sur- face is concave from above downwards, flat from side to side, marked by four transverse^lines, which indicate its original division into five pieces resembling so many vertebra, (hence sometimes called false vertebrae;) the first of these grooves is convex, the remaining are con- cave ; on either side of the median line are the four anterior sacral holes, the two upper large, the two lower small; they are all round and smooth, communi- cate with the sacral canal, and transmit the anterior sacral nerves; grooves lead outwards from these holes, [ along which the nerves run; these are analogous to the intervertebral holes, and the intermediate grooved bone to the transverse processes in the vertebral column above; external to these is a depressed surface, which gives attachment to the pyriform muscle. The poste- 1 rior or spinal surface is convex and very rough, pre- I senting in the median line four horizontal eminences analogous to the spinous processes, which are often united into one ridge; inferior to these the sacral canal ends in a triangular channel, which is only closed be- hind by ligament and bounded on each side by two tu- i I

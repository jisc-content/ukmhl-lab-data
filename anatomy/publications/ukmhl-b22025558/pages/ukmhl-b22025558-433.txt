4*23 The Os Pubis is situated at the forepart of the pelvis, and internal part of the acetabulum ; it may be divided into its body and processes; the bodij is the most ex- ternal, it is thick, and forms the internal and superior part of the acetabulum, above which it joins the ilium in the ilio-pectinaeal eminence, and below it is united to the body of the ischium ; from this the 1st process pro- ceeds, the horizontal ramus, forwards and inwards, smooth and Hat superiorl}'^, and covered by the pecti- najus, smooth also posteriorly towards the cavity of the pelvis, and grooved beneath for the obturator foramen; a sharp ridge separates its superior from its posterior surface ; this ridge is the anterior part of the linea ileo- pectinaea, into it the pectin^us muscle and Gimber- naut’s ligament are inserted ; at the internal extremity of this ramus and of this line is the 2nd process, the tuberosity or spine; this is a prominent tubercle into which Poupart’s ligament is inserted ; from this spine the 3rd process, the crest, leads transversely inwards; it is about an inch in length ; the rectus abdominis and j)yramidalis muscles arise from it; at its internal end is the 4-lli process, the symphisis; this descends nearly vertical, and is joined to the opposite one by an inter- vening cartilage ; as the symphisis turns down from the transverse crest there is the angle of the pubis; from the lower part of the symphisis descends the 5th pro- cess, the inferior or descending ramus in an oblique di- rection backwards and outwards, to meet the ramus of the ischium ; this, with the ramus of the opposite pubis, forms the arch of the pubis, its outer edge assists in bounding the thyroid hole. The acetabulum or articular cavity for the head of the thigh bone is formed b)' the junction of the bodies of these three bones in different proportions; the ischium constitutes a little more than two-fifths, the ilium some- what less than two-fifihs, and the pubis the remainder ; it is surrounded by a prominence which is deficient or notched at only one point, this notcli in the border is opposite the thyroid hole, and between the ischium and pubis, throiigli it the articular vessels pass ; a rougli surface, the only part uncovered by cartilage, leads from it to the centre of the cavity; to this the articular

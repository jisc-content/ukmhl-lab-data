2o7 Abductor Minimi Digiti, is situated along tlic outer edge of the foot, a?yses tendinous and fleshy from the outer side ot the os calcis, and from a strong liga- ment which extends from this to the fifth metatarsal bone, also from the base of the latter, from the plantar tascia and its external inter-muscular septum; inserted. tendinous into the outer side of the base of the first phalanx of the little toe, and into the adjoining surface ot the metatarsal bone. Use, to separate the little toe from the others, and to flex it; tliis muscle is also su- perficial, the fascia covering it is very strong, it is the most external of the muscles in this region. Detach this first layer of muscles from their posterior altach- ments, and throw them forwards towards the toes; the tendons of the flexor pollicis and communis are now exposed, also the accessory muscle and the lumbri- cales; all these constitute the second layer of the plantar muscles. Ihe tendon of the flexor longus digitorum communis IS seen passing from the inner side of the os calcis to the middle of the plantar region, where it divides into Its four tendons, which have been already described as entering the sheaths on the inferior surface of the four outer toes, passing through the slits in the tendons of the flexor brevis, and then inserted into the last pha- lanx ot each toe. The tendon of the flexor pollicis ongus is now also seen passing above the former, to which It IS united by a tendinous fasciculus, and then proceeding forwards to the great toe. Musculus Accessorius, or flexor digitorum acce«- sorius, arises fleshy and tendinous from the inferior and .memal part of the os calcis, forms a flat and soZS square fleshy belly, which proceeding forwards is sorted into the upper and outer part of the tendon of le flexor digitorum longus, just before it divides bse, to assist the long flexor, and to counteract itj obliquity ; this muscle lies above the flexor digitorum Luwbricales are four small muscles which tendinous and fleshy from the tendons of the flexor digitorum ongus; there is none for the great tL X hrs. or the .ntcroal one is the largest; ti.esi four m„scle! z 2

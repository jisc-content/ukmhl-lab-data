380 i the internal passes round the head of the tibia, the external is beneath the external lateral ligament; these arteries pass round the joint to its fore-part, inosculate with the preceding and with the anterior tibial recur- rent ; at the lower part of the ham the popliteal di- vides into the anterior and posterior tibial arteries. The anterior perforates the inter-osseous space close to the head of the fibula, descends obliquely forwards along the inter-osseous membrane and over the lower part of the tibia, the synovial membrane of the ankle, and the superior and internal part of the tarsus to the first inter-osseal space ; in the leg it is overlapped by the tibialis anticus internally, by the extensor commu- nis and extensor pollicis externally j it passes beneath the annular ligament of the ankle; on the tarsus it is covered by the skin and by the internal tendon of the extensor brevis; it is accompanied by two veins ; the anterior tibial nerve descends superficial and external to it; it gives off, 1st, the recurrent, which passes up- wards and inwards, and is lost around the articulation of the knee; 2nd, muscular branches, very numerous, to the muscles on the outer and anterior part of the leg; 3rd, malleolar branches, which ramify on the ex- ternal and internal malleoli; on the former they inos- culate with the anterior peronaeal; 4th and 5th, tarsal and metatarsal, are distributed to the bones and liga- ments of the tarsus and metatarsus; between the two first metatarsal bones it divides into, 6th and 7th, the arteria jJoUicis and the communicans ; the former sup- plies the integuments of the great toe; the latter.the first inter-osseal muscle, and inosculates with the plantar arteries. The posterior tibial artery descends obliquely in- wards between the superficial and deep layer of mus- cles on the back of the leg, to the space between the heel and inner ankle, where it divides into the internal and external plantar arteries; it is covered by the gastrocnemius and solaeus, and lies on the tibialis pos- ticus, flexor communis, and interiorly on the tibia; it is accompanied by two veins, and by the posterior â€¢tibial nerve, which lies to its external side ; it gives off", 1st, several muscular branches to the deep and super-

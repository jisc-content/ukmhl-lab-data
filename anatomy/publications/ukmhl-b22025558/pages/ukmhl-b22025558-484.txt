474> leading downwards and forwards, and divided into two for the extensorossis mecacarpi and primi internodii pollicis; the border between these two last grooves is prolonged down into the styloid process, from which the external lateral ligament of the wrist arises; on the internal border is an oblong smooth cavity, to receive the lower end of the ulna; inferioriy the radius presents an articular surface, divided by a line from before back- wards, into two unequal portions; the external is large and triangular, and meets the scaphoid bone ; the inter- nal is smaller, somewhat square, and meets the lunar bone. The radius, like other long bones, is of a cellular structure at each extremity, and compact in the centre, where it also contains a medullary canal, which is larger above than below ; it is developed from three points of ossification, one for the shaft and one for each extremity. The Hand consists of the carpus, metacarpus, and fingers. The carpus is composed of 8 bones, arranged in two rows ; the first rovo consists of the scaphoid, lunar, cu- neiform, and pisiform; the second of the trapezium, trapezoid, magnum, and unciform, enumerating them from the radial to the ulnar side, or from without in- wards. The scaphoid is the largest in the upper row, at jthe upper and outer side of which it is situated; it presents four articular surfaces ; it is elongated and convex on the upper or radial surface, adapted to llie external depression on the end of the radius ; the inferior sur- face directed a little outwards and backwards, is tri- angular, smooth, and convex, to articulate with the trapezium and trapezoides; into the posterior narrow surface, ligaments are inserted ; to the external or radial side, the external lateral ligament is attached ; the inner or ulnar side presents two smooth articulating surfaces ; one superior, narrow, to articulate with the lunar bone; the other inferior, large and concave, to articulate with the magnum. _ i The semicircular or lunar bone is smaller than the scaphoid; it presents four articulating surfaces; smooth and convex above to meet the radius, concave below to articulate with the magnum and unciform ; its ulnar

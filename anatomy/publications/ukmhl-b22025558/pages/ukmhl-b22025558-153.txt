Dissect the abdominal mus- cles oh the peritonaeum; these can be easily separated aterallv and interiorly; but anteriorly, partieularly near he iimbihens, it will be found very difficult to detach tne sheath of the rectus from this membrane ; the ex- ternal surface of the peritonaeum, which is thus ex- posed, appears rough and cellular, from its connexion to the superincumbent muscles; three ligamentous couls are seen, extending along it anteriorly and in- teriorly, from the summit and sides of the urinarv blander towards the umbilicus; the central one of these IS t ie remains of the urachus, and that on each side is the obliterated umbilical or hypogastric artery; an- tei ioily and superiorly vve perceive another ligamentous substance, ascending trom the umbilicus obliquely back- wards. and to the right side; this is the remains of the Lirabi.ical vein; it is at first placed between the peri- oniEumand the muscles, but it soon sinks deep towards named the suspensory ligament of the liver, which will be seen when the peritonaeum is opened ; the epi-astric vessels also may be observed ascending from ealih in- St "rts'^sr’ ^^‘‘a«ches of tlie internal mammary artu es descending on the surface of this membrane. ^oxt open the peritonaeum by an incision from the ensiform cartilage to the umbilicus, and from this point cairy another on each side obliquely downwardl, to all ‘ '‘i ' tin-owing down the inferior flap thus formed we remark on its internal surface the bpfnrS"’"r ° 1 ^ ligamentous cords which were betoie noticed as ascending from the bladder to the umbilicus; we may also remark bow the external of hese cords, nr the obliterated umbilical artery on each side throws the lower part of the peritonim ^to pouches, tuo on each side, the ejilernal and internal ingnnial pouches; the former lies between the ilium vessel, the latter be t cen tins cord and the fundus of ilte bladder u p expcrnal pouch is large and vc,« conca.c in^L; , and a,,pears to protrude fopvards the ingui„„! caiiaf;

21 lateral parts of the neck it sinks deep, behind the angle of the jaw, to which it adheres, and is connected to the styloid process of the temporal bone, and to the stylo-maxillary ligament: absorbent glands, the lower part of the parotid, and much cellular membrane here lie between these two fasciae. In this situation collec- tions of matter often form, the result of cynanche paio- tid3ea,orofinflammationofsomeofthelymphatic glands . such collections are productive of great inconvenience, causing such swelling and tension as to interfeie vyith the motions of the jaw, and with the act of deglutition. The cervical fasciae bind down the muscles and support the vessels and glands in this region; at the lower part of the neck they serve to protect the trachea and the upper part of the thorax from the pressure of the at- mosphere during inspiration. Dissect oft the platysma and superficial fascia, and examine the subjacent mus- cles. Steuno-Cleido Mastoideus, long and flat, placed at the anterior and lateral part of the neck, arises by a strong flat tendon with fleshy fibres posterior to it, from the upper and anterior part of the first bone ofthe sternum, also by short aponeurotic and fleshy fibres from the upper and anterior edge of the sternal third, sometimes half of the clavicle ; a small triangular space separates these two origins, through which small ves- sels and some cellular membrane pass : this space cor- responds to the sterno-clavicular articulation. The sternal and longer portion of this muscle ascends obliquely backwards and outwards, and overlaps the clavicular, which ascends vertically ; about the middle ofthe neck they are intimately joined, and are inserted by a thin, broad aponeurosis into the upper part of the mastoid process, and into the external third of the su- perior transverse ridge of the occipital bone. Use, the sternal portion can turn the face and head towards the opposite side: the clavicular, can bend the head and neck to its own side, so as to approxi.mate the ear and shoulder; and if the two portions of the muscle on each side act together, they will move the head down- wards and forwards. If the muscles on the back of the neck be in action,

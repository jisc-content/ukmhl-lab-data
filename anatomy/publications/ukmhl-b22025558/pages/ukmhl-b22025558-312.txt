302 the frontal sinus. The external branch, or the supra- orbital or proper Jrontal nerve appears as the continua- tion of the original trunk, both in size and in direction, it passes through the superciliary notch or foramen, as- cends on the forehead, divides into two branches winch subdivide into numerous filaments, these chiefly ascend in the muscles and integuments of the scalp, many ot them take a very long course, and communicate wU i the portio dura, with the occipital nerves, and with those from the opposite side. Neither ol these two nerves gives any filaments to the muscles in the orbit. The nasal nerve separates from the frontal behind the orbit, enters this cavity beneath that branch, an between the two heads of the external rectus, it then runs obliquely forwards and inwards above the optic nerve and^below the superior rectus muscle, and con- tinues its course along the inner side of the orbit be ow ^superior oblique muscle, and here div.des mlo two brancLs, the external or the lofra-troeh eator nerve, and the internal or the nasal; the nasal nerve, p e- vious to its entrance into the orbit, is joined by a fila- ment fVom the sympathetic nerve; on the outer side of the optic, and just as it enters this cavity, it gives off a delicate branch about an inch in lengt , w i runs along the outer side of the optic nerve to the lenti- cular ganglion; as the nasal nerve passes over the op ic riives ott- two ciliary nerves.

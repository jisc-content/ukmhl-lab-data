381 ficial muscles; 2d, theperonceal artery arises about an inch below the popliteal, descends obliquely outwards towards the external ankle j between the fibula and flexor pollicis; sends numerous branches to the mus- cles of the leg, and about two inches above the ankle divides into the anterior and posterior peronccal branches; the former pierces the inter-osseous ligament, and inosculates with the external malleolar; the latter spreads its branches on the outer side of the heel and of the foot; between the heel and inner ankle the pos- terior tibial divides into the internal and external plan- tar; the internal plantar proceeds along the internal side of the sole of the foot, supplying the muscles and integuments of the great toe, and inosculating with the adjacent vessels both on the dorsum and in the sole of the foot; the external plantar, much larger than the preceding, passes forwards and outwards above the flexor digitorum brevis, as far as the 5th metatarsal bone; it then bends across the metatarsus, along the transversalis pedis, as far as the 1st metatarsal bone, where it joins the anterior tibial, and thus forms the plantar arch, from which proceed numerous muscular branches, and the digital arteries; these last arise from the anterior or convex edge of the arch, pass forw'ards, supplying the lumbricales and interossei muscles, and divide each into two branches to supply the opposite sides of the toes. SECTION II. ANATOMY OF THE VEINS. In addition to the veins which accompany the arte- ries, the relative situation of which has been al- ready considered, there are also several veins which run independent of these, and take a superficial or subcutaneous course. It is impossible to fix the exact point at which a vein commences ; it is ge- nerally considered that the arteries having terminated in minute ramifications or capillaries, the veins com- mence from these, so that in reality each vein is a

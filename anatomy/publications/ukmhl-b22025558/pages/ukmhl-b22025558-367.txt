357 PART III. ANATOMY OF THE VASCULAE SYSTEM. UNDER THIS HEAD WE MAY CONSIDER THE ANATOMY OF THE ARTERIESj VEINS, AND LYMPHATICS. CHAPTER I. anatomy of THE ARTERIES. Xhe principal blood-vessels have been already de- scribed in the anatomy of the different regions; in the present section ilie arteries shall be considered in a systematic manner, commencing with the aorta, and tracing its branches tliroiigh all parts of the body. Aorta arises from the upper part of the left ven- tricle, opposite the 4th or 5th dorsal vertebra, (see page 72,) ascends obliquely forwards and to theâ€™rioht side, then turns backwards and to the left, and then descends along the dorsal vertebras; it thus forms the arch which terminates on the left side of the 4th ver- tebra: the thoracic aorta descends along the left side of the remaining dorsal vertebrae, inclining a little to their fore-part inferiorly, and passes between the crura of the diaphragm: the abdominal aorta descends on the lumbar vertebras, as far as the 4lh or 5th, where it divides into the two common iliac arteries. The aorta is at first covered by the pericardium and the pulmo- nary artery; as it ascends it lies between this vessel and the vena cava; the arch lies on the trachea a little above its division, and on the bodies of the 2d and 3d

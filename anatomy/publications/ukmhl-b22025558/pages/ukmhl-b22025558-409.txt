390 HL’MERO-CUBITAL ARTICULATION’, OR THE ELEOW- JOINT. The opposed extremities of tlie humerus, ulna, and radius, mutuall}' receive each otlier, and are attached together by an external and internal lateral, and by an anterior and posterior ligament. The external lateral ligament arises from the ex- ternal condyle, and is inserted into the annular li- gament of the radius ; this ligament is confounded >vith the tendons of the supinator and extensor nius- ■cles. The internal lateral arises from the inner condyle, and is inserted in a radiated manner into the inner edge of the coronoid and olecranon processes, it is longer and broader than the external, is somewhat tri- angular, and divides inferiorly into two fasciculi, the an- terior of which extends to the coronoid process, and is confounded with the common tendinous origin of the muscles of the fore-arm; the posterior is inserted into the olecranon process, is covered by the ulnar nerve and connected to the adjacent muscles; both portions ad- here to the synovial membrane. The anterior ligament consists of thin fibres whicli take an irregular direction over the fore-part of tl>e joint; they arise chiefly from above the internal con- dyle, and the depression on the fore-part of the hume- rus ; tliey thence spread over the synovial membrane, behind the brachiaeus anticus; some are inserted into the annular ligament of the radius, and the remainder are gradually lost on the synovial membrane. _ The -posterior ligament is not so distinct as the ante- rior, unless the fore-arm be flexed ; the fibres chiefly extend in a transverse direction from one condyle to the other, they are attached to the synovial membrane, and covered by the triceps and anconseus. 'J he synovial membrane is common to the humero-cu- bital as well as to the cubito-radial articulation ; this membrane descends behind the anterior ligament, and a quantity of reddish^ fatty matter which intervenes, to the neck of the radius and annular ligament; round

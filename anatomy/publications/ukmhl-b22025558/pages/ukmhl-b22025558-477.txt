467 its circumference is rough for the attachment of liga- ments ; the clavicle serves to support the scapula and p prevent it trom falling too much forwards or inwards, it thereby allows it a greater freedom of motion, it also serves as a fixed point for certain muscles, and it pro- tects the vessels and nerves of the upper extremity; it is very perfect in the foetus, and is developed form a single point ol ossification ; it has no perfect epiphysis, although in the young subject there is an osseous crust at each extremity, which is at first separable from the rest of the bone. The Scapula is situated at the upper, lateral, and pos- terior part ot the chest, and extends from the second to the seventh rib, it is irregularly flat and triangular, it presents an internal and an external surface, three edges and three angles; the internal or anterior surface or subscapular fossa looks towards the ribs, is slightly con- cave and divided by three or four prominent lines which run obliquely from above downwards, and from without inwards into several broad grooves, which are filled by the tasciculi ot the subscapular muscle, the aponeuro- sis ot which is attached to those ridges ; above and be- low these is a smooth flat surface to which the serratus magnus is attached; the external or posterior surface or the dorsum is divided transversely into two unequal parts by a ridge ov spine which commences at the pos- terior border ot the scapula, from a smooth polished flat triangular surface, it proceeds forwards and be- comes more elevated, flattened above and below, and bounded by a long irregular undulated margin, which is rough above for the attachment of the trapezius, and below for that of the deltoid muscle ; a vascular hole is observed on its upper and under surface ; this spine is a little contracted anteriorly and externally, and termi- nates in an eminence named the acromion process ; this surmounts the shoulder joint, about an inch above it, is flattened in a direction contrary to that of the spine,^ Us external surface looks a little upwards and backwards IS convex, rather rough, and covered by the inte^'u- ments, us inferior or internal surface is smooth and con- cave, Its upper edge is directed backwards, gives attach- ment to the trapezius and presents near its termination a

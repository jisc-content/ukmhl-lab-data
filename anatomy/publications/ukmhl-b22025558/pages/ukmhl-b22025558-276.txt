2G6 the tentorium ; the convex edge of this process corres- ponds to the middle ridge or groove of the os frontis, to the sagittal edge of the two parietal bones, and to the perpendicular ridge of the occipital; the great lon- gitudinal sinus is enclosed between the layers of this })rocess, the whole extent of this edge ; the concave or inferior border of the falx corresponds to the middle line of the corpus callosum, from which it is but a very short distance; the inferior or lesser longitudinal sinus is enclosed in this ridge; the falx divides the cavity of the cranium in the median line, it separates the hemis- pheres of the cerebrum, and in dift’erent positions of the body supports the weight of each ; in old subjects it is often cribriform, and in some it is partly converted into bone. The tentorium ce7'ebeUi extends in somewhat a horizonal direction across the posterior part of the cra- nium ; it may be seen by gently raising the back part of either hemisphere of the brain; the convex edge of this fold is attached to the transverse ridge of the occi- pital bone, to the inferior angle of the parietal bones, to the superior angle of the petrous bones, and to the posterior clinoid processes of the sphenoid ; over this last attachment, the concave edge of the tentorium glides and h inserted into the anterior clinoid processes; the tentorium is raised and held in a state ot tension along the median line by the falx, its inferior surface is concave; anteriorly it presents a large oval opening, which is on a plane anterior to the foramen magnum, this is filled by the superior vermiform process of the cerebellum, the crura cerebri and the pons varolii; alon«- the convex edge of the tentorium, between its layers are two sinuses on each side, the great lateral and the superior petrous, in the median line also is another called the straight sinus, which extends along the base of the falx ; the tentorium serves to support the weight of the cerebrum oil the cerebellum. The fdlx cerclielli is seen when the brain is removed ; it is a small but thick process of little importance, the base is superiorly attached to the tentorium, the apex inferiorly, at the foramen magnum ; its convex edge adheres to the occipital spine, and contains between its layers the occipital sinuses; its concave edge sepa-

94 toid ; but between these and the latissimus dorsi, a por- tion of it is superficial. It lies on the bone, and the scapular vessels and nerves ; a large bursa lies between its tendon and the neck of the scapula. Teres Minor, small and narrow, inseparably at- tached to the last muscle, along the edge of which it runs; it arises from a depression between the two ridges on the inferior costa of the scapula, from the fascia which covers it, and from ligamentous septa, which enclose it; the fibres ascend obliquely forwards and outwards, cover and adhere to the capsule, and are inserted below the infra-spinatus into the inferior depres- sion on the great tuberosity of the humerus. Use, to co-operate with the last muscle. The origin of the teres minor is between and overlapped by the infra-spi- natus and teres major muscles; its middle portion is su- perficial, and its insertion is covered by the deltoid; it lies on the scapula, subscapular vessels, capsular liga- ment, and long head of the triceps, which last separates it from the teres major. SuB-ScAPULARis, is situated on the inner side of the scapula, opposite to the three last described muscles, broad and triangular, the base behind, the apex before ; it arises from all the surface and circumference of the sub-scapular fossa, the fibres run in thick fasciculi up- wards and forwards, and all converge towards the neck of the capsula, over which they glide, beneath the cora- coid process, and the muscles which are inserted into it; they end in a tendon which is intimately united to the scapular ligament, and inserted into the internal or small tubercle of the humerus; this muscle is covered by the scapula and the muscles of the shoulder; its in- ferior edge is in contact with the teres major; its inter- nal surface, which forms part of the axilla, is connected to the serratus magnus, and to the axillary vessels and nerves, by loose cellular membrane : a large bursa, very often communicating with the joint, lies between its ten- don and the neck of the scapula, beneath the coracoid process: another smaller bursa.is sometimes situated low- er down, between the tendon and the capsular ligament. Use, this, which is the strongest of these capsular raus-

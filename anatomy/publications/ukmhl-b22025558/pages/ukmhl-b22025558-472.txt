462 presents in its two posterior thirds a large puliey-like articular surface, which is convex from behind forwards, and concave transversel}^ it is inclined a little back- wards, is broader before than behind, and more promi- nent externally than internally ; anterior to this is a rough depression, on the neck of the bone, for the in- sertion of ligaments ; inferiorly, it presents two articu- lar surfaces for the os calcis, one is posterior and exter- nal, broad and concave, the other is anterior and internal and convex ; these surfaces are separated by a deep groove, which is narrow behind, broad before, and di- rected forwards and outwards ; strong ligaments pass from this groove to the os calcis; the posterior surface of the astragulas is narrow and slightly grooved in an oblique direction, downwards and inwards for the ten- don of the flexor pollicis; it presents externally a pointed eminence to which the external lateral ligament of the ankle joint is attached ; the anterior extremity is a smooth round head supported by a sort of neck, it is directed forwards, inwards and downwards, and is arti- culated with the navicular bone ; the external side piâ€™e- sents a triangular, smooth surface, concave from above downwards, and a little convex from before backwards, it is articulated with the (ibula; the inner side is rough for ligaments, except a cartilaginous surface near the upper part, which is smaller than that on the outer side, and broader before than behind, this is articulated with the internal malleolus. The Calcnneum or os calcis is the largest bone in the tarsus, at the lower and posterior part of which it is placed, it is elongated posteriorly into a process called the heel, its upper surface presents two articulating surfaces to support the astragalus; the posterior is convex, broad, and directed forwards and outw'ards, the anterior is internal, narrow, and concave ; these <ye separated by a deep rough transverse groove into which strong ligaments are inserted ; internal to this the bone is uneven, and projects into a sort of process,- into which the internal lateral ligament of the ankle joint is inserted ; the inferior surface is smaller than the superior and is nearly flat, it presents small tubercles for the attachment of muscles and ligaments ; the pos-

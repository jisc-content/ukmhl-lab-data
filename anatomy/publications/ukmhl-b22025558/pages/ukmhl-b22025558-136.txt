126 nal oblique; it is very strong, and when the lower extre- mity is extended, and the foot and toes everted, it ap- pears very tense; if we consider it as a distinct ligament, it may be described as having an attachment to, or as arisivg from the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium, and thence descending obliquely forwards and in- wards to the pubis, into which it is inserted by two attachments, one anteriorly into the tuberosity or spine; the other posteriorly into the linea innominata of the pubis, or the commencement of the linea ileo-peclinea : the 1st or iliac end of Poupart’s ligament is broad and continuous above, with the tendon of the oblique, and bel6w with the fascia lata; the anterior portion of the pubal end or the second insertion, is distinct and round, and can be felt through the skin ; it lies behind the cord, and is connected to that portion of the fascia lata which covers the adductor muscles; the posterior pubal attachment or the third insertion, also called Gimber- iiaut’s liga^nent, is broad and thin, and lies superior, pos- terior, and external to the former; it may be seen by raising the cord out of the external ring, and everting E’oupari’s ligament a little ; it is of a triangular form, the apex is anterior towards the tuberosity or spine of the pubis; the base is external and posterior, somewhat cres- centic, looking towards the femoral vessels; to it some fibres from the outer or iliac part of the fascia lata are attached, so as to elongate it in this direction : this third insertion of Poupart’s ligament forms the internal boun- dary of the femoral ring, and is therefore concerned in the anatomy of femoral hernia, as will be seen hereafter. Poupart’s ligament owes much of its strength to its con- nexion with the fascia lata of the thigh, as may be seen at present, also to its attachment to the fascia transversa- lis and iliaca, which will be exposed in a future stage of the dissection. Poupart’s ligament is of wse in strength* enintr the inferior part of the abdomen, and affording a fixed point of attachment to the deeper muscles anc to the different aponeuroses; it also protects the great femoral vessels and nerves in their passage from the ab- domen to the thigh, and its third insertion partlj' fills up the internal portion of the crural arch. From this third insertion, and from the pubis, u band of fibres may e

268 are most numerous; they are found in three situations, in the cavity of the sinus, external to the dura mater, or internal to it; the first are termed the glandulae mediae, the second, the externae, and the third the in- ternae; their use or structure is unknown, most proba- bly they are by no means allied to the glandular system. The longitudinal sinus, like all the other sinuses, con- sists of two tunics, the internal or the venous mem- brane, and the external or fibrous coat derived from the dura mater; this membrane is described as dividing into two layers on either side of the cavity; one con- tinues to adhere to the bone, and the other laminae descend on either side of the sinus, and unite in the falx; the base of the triangular cavity thus formed is towards the bone, the apex tow'ards the falx ; in addi- tion to many small veins, from the bones and from the dura mater, this sinus receives near the vertex eight or ten large veins from the upper surface of each hem- isphere of the brain, these run obliquely forwards be- tween the coats of the sinus, some for an inch, others for less, before they open into the' cavity, and just as they are terminating, they turn slightly, so that their mouths look inwards, or towards those of the opposite side; all the veins which enter the sinus do not take the oblique course now described, and vvhich is most probably designed to impede the reflux of the blood from the sinus into the cerebral veins. The inferior longitudinal sinus is not always present, it resembles a small vein enclosed in the lower edge of the falx near its base, it receives small veins from the corpus callo- sum, and ends in the following; the straight sinus is situated in the median line, enclosed between the la- minae of the base of the falx and above the tentorium, it receives the blood from the lateral ventricles returned by the two vente Galeni; this sinus proceeds backwards and downw-ards, and ends in the confluence of the two lateral and longitudinal sinuses ; it presents internally the same fibrous appearance as the great longitudinal sinus. The lateral are the largest sinuses, ot somew'hat an elliptical figure, each proceeds at first horizontally outwards and forwards, enclosed between the laminae of the tentorium, in a groove in the occipital bone, and

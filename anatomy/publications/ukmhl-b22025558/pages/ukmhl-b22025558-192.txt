182 niiixirnus overhangs this ligament j the tuberosity and ramus of the ischium can be felt through the integu- ments, also (unless the subject be very fat) the ramus of the pubis leading obliquely upwards on each side to the symphysis : the integuments of the perinaeum and scrotum are generally of a dark brownish color in the adult, and of a reddish hue in the child; very thin around the anus, and covering the scrotum, but dense in the intermediate space: along the mesial line, a pro- minent hard ridge is observable, the raphe of the peru naeum ; this line commences in front of the anus, and extends along the perinaeum, scrotum and penis, as tar as the prepuce of the latter. Dissect oft the integu- meats from this region, and we expose posteriorly a cutaneous muscle (the spincter ani) surrounding the anus, and anteriorly a strong fascia covering the mus- cles of the perinaeum, the crura penis, and the corpus soongiosum urethrae. , , , Sphincter Ani is flat, thin, oval, pale, and open in the middle ; it arises from a ligamentous substance, which extends from the os coccygis to the rectum ; t^he fibres descend obliquely forwards, expanding on eithei side nearly as far outwards as the tuberosity of the is- chium ; at the posterior part of the anus this rnuscle divides into two fasciculi, which pass, one at ^ach si e of this opening, and unite at its anterior pai t, thus en- circling this orifice ; inserted into the raphe m the inte- gumei^s, and into the superficial fascia ; ^ ft also perforates the latter, and is inserted into he common central point of the perinaeum ; a point which will be more fully seen when the fascia shall have been TaiU Use; to close the anus; it may also draw downward the bulb of the urethra ; this >s a W constantly in a state of contraction, and like all the iihiJctcr muscles, belongs to the class ot mixed mus- cles One of its surfaces looks upwards, 1 rnwfirds • one edge is internal, the other external.

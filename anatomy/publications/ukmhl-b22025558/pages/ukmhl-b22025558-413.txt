403 The inter-articular ligament, or ligamentum teres, arises narrow from tlie depression on the head of the femur, passes downwards and inwards, and be- coming broad, is inserted by two fibrous bands into the extremities of the notch in the edge of the acetabulum, and by tlie synovial membrane to the tatty substance that covers the rough surface at the bottom of the cavity. rÂ£MOKO-TIBIAL ARTICULATION, OK THE KNEE JOINT. The condyles of the femur, the head of the tibia, and the patella, enter into this articulation ; the ligaments which secure it may be classed into those external and those internal to the synovial membrane, although strictly they are all external to it; the external li- gaments are, the ligamentum patellte, ligamentum posticum, and the internal and external lateral liga- ments. The ligamentum patellce consists of strong parallel tendinous fibres which descend from the inferior angle of the patella, and are inserted into the tubercle of the tibia, a little below a small bursa which lies behind this ligament; it is partly a continuation of the exten- sor tendon. The posterior ligament has been noticed in the dis- section of the semi-membranosus muscle, from the ten- don of which this ligament arises; it then ascends ob- liquely from behind the inner condyle of the tibia to the external condyle of the femur.' The internal lateral ligament is broad and flat, arises from the internal condyle of the femur, descends ob- liquely forwards, and is inserted into the internal con- dyle of the tibia, and into the semilunar cartilage. Phe external lateral ligament or ligaments arise from the external condyle, are thick and round, descend backwards, and are inserted into the head of the fibula ; a portion ol tlie biceps tendon sometimes separates these ligaments; in many cases they form but a sin- gle cord. The synoyial membrane of the knee is the largest in the body ; it ascends between two and three inches on the fore-part of the femur, is thence reflected to the

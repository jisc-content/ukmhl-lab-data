249 gus, and descends between the peronaeus tertiiisand the flexor pollicis longns, and partly concealed by the pe- ronaeus longus ; it continues fleshy lower down than it, and projects on either side of its tendon ; it is separated from the peronaeus tertius by the external malleolus ; in the groove in the latter it is beneath the long pero- naaal tendon, that is nearer to the bone, but on the os calcis it is superior to it; an aponeurosis sometimes unites its insertion to that of the extensor tendon of the little toe. In the dissection of the foregoing muscles we meet with the anterior tibiai. vessels and their branches; also the peronaeal nerve and its divisions. The anterior tibiai artery is a branch of the popliteal; it passes forwards between the solaeus and poplitaeus, perforates the inter-osseous space, surrounded by some fibres of the tibialis posticus; it then descends obliquely in- wards and forwards as far as the cleft between the first and second metatarsal bones j in its course down the leg it is placed at first between the tibialis anticus and extensor communis, in the middle of the leg, between the former and the extensor pollicis, and inferiorly be- tween the tendon of the latter and that of the extensor communis; above it lies on the inter-osseous membrane, below it passes over the tibia, the synovial membrane of the ankle joint, the astragalus, navicular and cunei- foira bones and beneath the annular ligament and the internal tendon of the extensor digitorum brevis; in the leg the anterior tibiai artery sends off, first, the recurrent branch, which ascends on the outer and fore- part of the head of the tibia, and meets the external articular arteries; second, in its course along the leg, several muscular branches ; third, near the ankle, the two malleolar branches, of these, the external is the larger and inosculates with a small artery (the anterior peronaeal) which perforates the inter-osseous ligament about two inches above the ankle joint; on the tarsus, the anterior tibiai artery sends off the tarsal and meta- tarsal branches, which pass obliquely outwards, and supply the inter-ossei muscles, the bones and joints of the tarsus and metatarsus; between the two first me- tatarsal bones the anterior tibiai divides into the supe-

64 domen ; in this course the aorta furnishes the following branches : two or three bronchial arteries, which go to the lungs, as many oesophageal branches, and nine or ten pair of intercostal arteries, whose name implies their destination. The vena azygos commences in the abdomen by a small branch from one of the superior lumbar veins, en- ters the thorax behind the right side of the posterior mediastinum, covered by the right pleura; and opposite the 3d or 4<th dorsal vertebra it arches forwards over the root of the right lung, and opens into the superior vena cava, as that vessel is entering the pericardium. The vena azygos in this course receives the bronchial, oeso- phageal, and intercostal veins; those of the left side often unite into one branch, which passing behind the aorta, joins, opposite the 6th or 7 th vertebra, the prin- cipal trunk on the right side. The thoracic duct also commences in the abdomen, on the 2d or 3d vertebra, behind the aorta, in a sinus, called receptaculum chyli; contracting in size it enters the posterior mediastinum along with and to the right side of the aorta; it ascends between this vessel and the vena azygos, imbedded in fat, and opposite to the .'jth or 6th dorsal vertebra it attaches itself to the back of the cesophagus, runs ob- liquely along it, behind the arcii of the aorta, to the left side, and ascends in the neck behind the left carotid artery and jugular vein, as high as the 6th cervical ver- tebra ; it then bends downwards and outwards, and en- ters the left subclavian just before it joins the jugular vein. Tlie coats of the thoracic duct are so fine and thin, that it is often difficult to see or trace this vessel. For a more particular description of it, see the Anatomy of the Absorbent System. The splanchnic nerves arise by f our or five filaments from the dorsal ganglions of the sympathetic nerve ; the first is from the 5th or 6th gang- lion, the rest arise in succession below it; all unite and form the splanchnic nerves, which descend obliquely for- wards on each side of the aorta, along with which they enter the abdomen, where each terminates in^ a large ganglion, termed semilunar; these two ganglions^ are joined together by numerous branches, which constitute cceliac, ov solar plexus, from which the greater num-

11(3 Lumbricales, arise from the outer side of the ten- dons of the flexor profundus, near the carpus, a little beyond the annular ligament; they each form a small fleshy belly, which ends in a tendon; this runs along the radial side of the finger, joins the tendon of the corres- ponding interosseous muscle, and is inserted about the middle of the first phalanx into the tendinous expansion which covers the back part of each finger. Usey to assist in bending the first joint of the finger ; they can- not act unless the flexors are tense; the)' can also adduct and abduct the fingers, and when the common extensor muscle is in action, they may assist in extend- ing them; these small muscles are covered by the super- ficial flexor tendons, palmar vessels and nerves; the first is the largest, the fourth the smallest; the two middle run nearly parallel,but the internal and external diverge: the tendons of the lumbricales frequently divide into two portions ; one of these will be inserted into the first phalanx, the other into the posterior tendinous expan- sion. On the inner side of the palm of the hand are the three following muscles, which belong to the little finger. Abductor Miniivii Digiti, arises fleshy from the annular ligament and from the pisiform bone; its fibres run along the ulnar side of the metacarpal bone, and are tendinous into the ulnar side of the 1st phalanx; its name implies its use; it is superficial; a few fibres of the palmaris only cover it ; its origin is partly conti- nuous with the insertion of the flexor carpi ulnaris. Flexor Brevis Minimi Digiti, arises from the annular ligament and unciform bone, inserted by a round lendon into the base of the first phalanx of the little finger. Use, to flex and adduct the little finger; it lies to the radial side of the last muscle, along with which it is inserted. Adductor, or Optonens Minimi Digiti, arises internal to the last, and overlapped by it, and is inserted into all the metacarpal bone of this finger : its name de- notes its use. When all the flexor and extensor tendons have been removed, we observe the intervals between the meta- carpal bones to be filled by muscular fibres, which are called the interosseous muscles; they arc divided into

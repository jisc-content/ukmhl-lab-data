234- cular fibre adlieres; the crurseus descends close to the femur to its inferior third, the fibres then incline for- wards, become tendinous posteriorly, and are separated from the bone by a large bursa, and by a considerable quantity of fat; inserted into the upper and outer edge of the patella, also into the synovial membrane of the knee behind the vasti, particularly the external, to which it is here intimately united. Use, to assist the vasti and the rectus in-extentJiog the leg. 'Ibis muscle is covered by the rectus afid tHie vasti, from the latter it can only be separated superiorly by tearing a few mus- cular fibres, and tracing some large nerves and vessels that pass between them. Ihe large bursa, which is situated behind the lower part of this tymscle, is at- tached to and frequently communicates with the syno- vial membrane of the joint; a few muscular fibres are generally attached to this-membrane, and have been described as a distinct muscle, the Sub-cruiial or Cap- sular, this arises from the anterior surface of the temur, about its inferior fourth, passes forwards and down- wards, and is inserted into the synovial membrane. Use to raise the synovial membrane in extension ot the kg, so as to prevent its being contused by the *"^Sacilis, flat, long, and thin, broad and fleshy above, round and tendinous below, situated at the inner side of the thigh, immediately beneath the mte- gumems and fascia; arises by a thin short tendon frora^ the lower half of the symphysis, and Irom the mnei edge of the descending ramus of the pubis ; it soon ue- comes fleshy, and descends vertically, one edge directed forwards, the other backwards, and its surfaces looking one inwards, the other outwards; about the inferior fifth of the thigh it ends in a round tendon wmch p^ses behind the inner condyle, and then tnrns with the tendon of the sartorius, behind and beneatl which it lies ; inserted into the superior part ot the in- ternal surface of the tibia, and semi-tendinosus. Use, to adduct the leg a g j to bend the knee, and turn the leg and toot inwaids. The origin of the gracilis is between the tlie crus penis; its whole course is superficial, except

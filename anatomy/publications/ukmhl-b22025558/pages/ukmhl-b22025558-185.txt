175 I DISSECTION OF THE DEEP MUSCLES OF THE ABDOMEN. Diaphragm is exposed by dissecting oif the peri- tonaeum ; it separates the abdomen from the thorax, be- ing concave towards the former cavity, convex towards the latter ; it may be divided into two portions, a supe- rior broad portion (the true diaphragm) and the infe- rior lesser portion, or the appendices or crura of the diaphragm. The superior true diafhragm is broad, thin, and nearly circular; it arises by distinct fleshy fasciculi, from the posterior surface of the xiphoid cartilage, and from the internal surface of the cartilages of the last true, and of all the false ribs; these fasciculi indigitate with those of the transversalis muscle; between the extremity of the last rib and the side of the spine, it arises from the upper part of a strong aponeurosis, which covers the quadratus lumborum muscle; this is the anterior lamina of the tendon of the transversalis; the upper edge of this fascia being very tense, particu- larly when the 12th rib is everted, and appearing to be extended as a distinct ligament between this bone and the first lumbar vertebra, has received the name of the iigamentum arcuatum ; it is not a distinct ligament; it may, however, be named the external orjalse Iigamentum arcuatum, to distinguish it from a true and distinct liga- ment, which extends from the transverse process of the 1st to the body of the 2d lumbar vertebra; this may be named thetrue or in^ernn/ligamentum arcuatum; its con- cavity looks downwards, and extends across the upper ex- tremity of the psoas magnus and the sympathetic nerve; from the convex edge of this ligament the diaphragm* next arises; from this extensive origin the fibres pass in different directions, the anterior backwards and upwards to the edge of the cordiform tendon, the middle upwards and inwards, and then a little downwards, to the lateral borders of the central tendon, and the posterior fibres pass forwards and upwards to the posterior edge of the tendon; the anterior fibres are the shortest, the lateral

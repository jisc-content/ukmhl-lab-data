198 by everting the bladder, and dissecting off the nnicous membrane near the orifice of the urethra behind the uvula. At the anterior part of the inferior, region there is a compact layer of white dense fibrous sub- stance, into which the muscular fibres ot the bladder are inserted^ but which itself does not appear to be muscular except near the cervix; this structure \yill be found to correspond with a particular region, which will be noticed presently in the interior of tlie bladdei, and which is called the trigone, or the velum. Beneath the muscular is the 3d, or the cellulnr coat; it invests the whole organ, is very elastic, and seldom contains any adipose substance. Open the bladder by a perpen- dicular incision through its anterior part ; and the 4'th, or the mucous coat, will be observed ; this is pale, and thrown into many folds, particularly if the bladder had been empty, for this membrane has no contractile pow- er â€¢ through it the muscular fibres project, presenting a reticulated appearance, and very frequently the mu- cous membrane forms pouches, or small sacks, between these: inferiorly is seen the orifice of the urethra; it is somewhat of a crescentic figure, a small tubercle (tlie uvula) projecting into it from below : posterior to this the mucous membrane presents a smooth and dense ap- pearance throughout a small triangular space called the nielum or trigone; at the posterior angles of this space the orifice of each ureter may be observed, the line ex- tending between these forms the base of this triangle ; this line is somewhat semilunar j the sides of the tri- gone are defined by lines drawn from each ureter to lie uvula ; each is from an inch to an inch and a halt in length; beneath the membrane covering each oi these lines pale muscular fibres may in genera b found; these have been named by Mr. Bell, the mis-, cles of the ureters, who describes each as armng from the vesical extremity of the ureter, and thence descend- ing obliquely forwards and inwards, to be inserted by a fendon common to its fellow into the uvula. Fhe use. which he assigns to them is, to restrain the termina.ioii of the ureters, and preserve the obliquity of the of these tubes through the coats of the bladder when it is cont^^^^^^^^ for, fays he, without this provision the

493 some not being larger than a walnut, and others being larger than a childâ€™s head. Another sort of polypus forms in the uterus, which consists of an irregular bloody substance, with tattered processes hanging from it ; when cut into it appears to be a spongy mass, hold- ing large cells. The most common part to which poh'pi adhere, is the fundus uteri, and sometimes they are found attached to the os tineas. Ovnria. The mem- biane covering or the substance of the ovary, are very rarely found inflamed, except when they are included in general peritonitis ; when the inflammation proceeds from the uterus, it sometimes goes on to the formation nf pus in the ovary. Dropsy. The most common dis- ease in the ovary is dropsy, the whole substance of the ovarium is sometimes converted into a capsule contain- ing fluid. When the ovaria have become dropsical, their natural structure has disappeared, and they are found converted into cells, communicating with one another by considerable openings, and very much en- larged ; the ovaria are sometimes converted into a series of cysts, which have no communication with each other; these cysts have been confounded with hydatids, to which they bear some resemblance; they are however very different; they have much firmer and less pulpy coats than hytadids, they contain a different kind of fluid, and they are differently connected among them- selves. Hydatids either lie unconnected, or one laro-e one encloses a number of small ones; while ovarian cysts adhere to each other by broad surfaces, and do not enclose each other. The ovaria are sometimes found converted into cysts, holding large masses of fat, hair and some teeth ; these substances appear to be gene- rated by the internal membrane of the cyst; the hairs are most of them loose in the fatty substance, but many of them adhere to the inside of the capsule; the teetli winch are not always perfect, are sometimes attached to tlie cyst, and at others, to an irregular mass of bone. u u

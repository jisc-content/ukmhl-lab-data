110 to make the hand look supine; it can also bend the elbow joint. This muscle is superficial; it passes over the extensor carpi radialis longus above, the tendon of the pronator teres in the middle, and the radius infe- riorly; its tendon descends at first between the pro- nator teres and extensor radialis longus, afterwards be- tween the latter and that of the flexor carpi radialis : at its insertion it is crossed by the extensor tendons of the thumb. This muscle and its tendon overlap the radial nerve and vessels ; its ulnar edge, therefore, will serve as a guide to the latter, in case we are required, during life, to expose them, in order to tie a ligature around the radial artery. Extensor Carpi Radialis Longus, arises ten- dinous and fleshy from the ridge on the external side of the humerus, between the supinator longus and the external condyle; it passes over the outside of the joint, ends in a flat tendon, which descends along the outer and back part of the radius, runs through a groove on its lower extremity, and passing over the wrist joint, is inserted into the back part of the carpal end of the metacarpal bone of the index finger. Vse, it extends the wrist, bends the hand backwards, and abducts it a little; it may also assist in bending the elbow joint; it is covered by the last muscle, but projects behind it; the tendon passes beneath the extensors of the thumb and the annular ligament; it covers the supinator brevis and the following muscle. Extensor Carpi Radialis Brevis, arises tendi- nous and fleshy from the inferior and posterior part of the external condyle, and from the external lateral liga- ment, descends along the back part of the radius, ends in a flat tendon, which runs through the same groove as the tendon of the last muscle, beneath which it lies; passes also beneath the annular ligament, and is m- serled into the carpal extremity of the third metacarpal bone. Use, similar to that of the last; it is covered superiorly by the last described muscle, and by the su- pinator longus, and below by the tendons of the ex- tensor muscles of the thumb, and by that of the last muscle, and by the skin ; it covers the supinator brevis and the insertion of the pronator teres.

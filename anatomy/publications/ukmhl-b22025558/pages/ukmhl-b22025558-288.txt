278 The fornix, white, fibrous, triangular, is situated ho- rizontally, beneath the corpus callosum and septum lu- cidum, attached to the former posteriorly, to the latter anteriorly, it lies on the velum interpositumand choroid plexuses; the base posteriorly, arises, by two flat bands, (the posterior pillars or crura,) one from either side, from the hippocampus, major and minor, and from the taenia hippocampi, these crura pass forwardsand inwards, and unite (the body of the fornix;) this bends forwards and downwards, over the foramen commune anterius, and divides into two short, round, white cords, {^x\\e anterior pillars of the fornix) these descend behind the anterior commissure, and end in the corpora mammillaria, which are covered with grey substance from the tuber cine- reum : the inferior surface of the fornix which rests on the velum is marked posteriorly by several fine oblique lines {lyra or corpus psalloides.) Although the septum lucidum is a partition between the lateral ventricles, yet these cavities communicate together, as also with the third or middle ventricle, through an opening termed foramen commune anterius, this is situated in the me- ' dian line at the anterior part of the body of each ven- tricle, it is bounded superiorly and anteriorly by the for- nix, posteriorly by the two choroid plexuses and velum, laterally it leads from one lateral ventricle to the other, and interiorly it opens into the third. The optic tha- lami cannot be fully examined at present. In the pos- terior cornu of each ventricle is a small eminence, the hippocampus minor, large anteriorly, small and pointed behind, white on the surface, grey internally. In the inferior cornu we see the hippocampus major, a large white substance, convex externally, concave internally, smooth and white on the surface, grey within, extend- r.,.. «n dinner the floor of the cavity, and ending in a Ui LIJC i 1 (pineritious line may be observed, shorter than of the fornix • beneath the taenia hippocampi, a narrow * . < 1 I- ^ OO -

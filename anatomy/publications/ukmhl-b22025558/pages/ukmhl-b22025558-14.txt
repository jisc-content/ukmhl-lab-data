4 strongest of these auricular muscles ; it arises from the mastoid process above thesterno-mastoid muscle, passes forwards, and is inserted into the back part of the con- cha. This muscle is covered only by the skin, and lies on the temporal bone. In addition to these muscles, which move the exter- nal ear, there are several small muscles attached to dif- ferent parts of the cartilages, which serve to alter their form, and expand their cavities ; these muscles, as also those in the tympanum, shall be described hereafter in the dissection of the organ of hearing.* SECTION II. DISSECTION OF THE EXTERNAL PARTS OF THE FACE. The muscles of thej^ce require careful dissection : they are delicate, and often very pale; they may be classed into the superficial and deep; the former into those of the eyelids, nose, mouth, and lips; the latter into those of the lower jaw and palate. Make an inci- sion around the base of the orbit, through the skin, which is here very fine, and closely adhering to the fibres of the orbicularis muscle ; next make a perpen- dicular incision along the middle line of the nose, to the centre of the upper lip, continue this in a semicircular manner round the angle of the mouth to the middle of the lower lip, and thence to the chin, and lastly from the chin to the angle of the jaw; reflect the integuments cautiously from the eyelids and side of the face, as far back as Uie ear, avoiding the slender muscular fibres which adhere to the skin, and the vessels and nerves which will be exposed in this dissection. Orbicularis Palpebrarum, broad and thin, somewhat oval, in some subjects very pale and indis- â€¢ Previous to, or immediately after dissecting the muscles of the face, the student should examine the brain, the description of which organ will be found at the head of that of the nervous system.

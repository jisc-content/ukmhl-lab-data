220 of adipose substance, and by a few deep-seated lym- phatic glands; when these are removed, we always find the vein internal to the artery, and about an inch and a half from the spine of the pubis ; immediately external to the vein is the artery resting on the psoas, and about a quarter of an inch external to the artery is the ante- rior crural nerve, imbedded between the psoas and ilia- cus, and covered by the fascia iliaca, it does not theie- fore lie in the sheath of the vessels. Clean the several^ muscles which now partially appear on the fore-part ot the thigh ; external to the vessels, the sartorius and tensor vaginae are first seen ; internal to the vessels are the pectinaeus, gracilis and the three adductors, and im- mediately covering the anterior and lateral parts ot the femur are the rectus, cruraeus, vastus internus, and externus. MUSCLES ON THE FORE-PART AND SIDES OF THE THIGH. Tensor vagin® femoris, at the upper and outer nart of the thigh, narrow above, broad and thm below, tendinous and fleshy from the externa part o the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium it forms a fleshy belly, which descends obliquely back- wards, and is inserted, broad and thm, into a duplica- ture of the fascia lata on the outside of the thigh, about three inches below the great trochanter ; use, to make tense the fascia, to rotate the thigh inwards; also to assist in flexing and abducting it. Ihe ^ . muscle is between the sartorius and ’ between these muscles it descends, coveied by the fascia lata; its insertion is anterior to that of the g tJEus maximus muscle. . tLin Sartorius is the longest muscle m tl?e bodj. th.n •md flat like a riband, broader in the middle than at the extremities, situated obliquely along inner side of the thigh, ^ from the anterior superior spate ol the the notch below that process, it soon becomes broac and fleshy, extends obliquely across ll« h's'' » “ ner side, and descending perpendtculaily to the knee

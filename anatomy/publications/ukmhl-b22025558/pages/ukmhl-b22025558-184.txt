174 nalis, and runs for the extent of an inch between the tunics of the bladder, and opens internally (as will be seen hereafter in the dissection of the pelvic viscera) about an inch and a half from the commencement of the urethra, and about the same distance from its fellow. In the female tire pelvic portion of each ureter is longer than the male ; they also lie at a greater distance from each other, and perforate the bladder nearer to its neck than in the male subject. The ureter is composed ex- ternally of a fibrous coat, and internally ot a pale mu- cous membrane; it is surrounded by cellular tissue, and in some situations is partially covered by peritonaeum. The ureters are larger at their commencement, and smaller at their termination; the intermediate portion of each is nearly of one uniform diameter. Attached to the upper extremity of each kidney is a small gland-like substance, named renal capsule, or supra-renal, ov atrabiliary body; ot a crescentic shape, the base attached to the kidney by cellular membrane and by small blood-vessels; these organs lie on the diaphragm, and on the semilunar ganglion of each side, and are covered, that on the right side by the vena cava and duodenum, and on the left by the spleen and pan- creas ; a vein also runs along their anterior surface. In the interior of each renal capsule we find a small trian- gular cavity filled with a brownish fluid ; the walls of this cavity are very rough, no excretory duct can be found leading from it. The exact use of these bodies is not ascertained. The renal capsules in the adult aie thin, and of a brownish yellow colour; in the foetus they are very large and vascular, nearly equal to the kidney m size, and contain a quantity of reddish fltd^.^ ^ The bladder and urethra are the next divisions ot the urinary organs to be examined; as these, howevei, are pelvic viscera, we shall postpone the consideration of of them for the present, and the student should next examine the deep muscles of the abdomen, viz. the diaphragm, and the quadratus lumborum psoas parvus, psoas magnus, and iliacus internus ot each side.

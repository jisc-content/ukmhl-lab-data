445 The Malar or Cheek Bone is placed at the outer, and under part of the orbit, and forms the prominence of the cheek ; it is of an irregular square form, convex externally, and covered by the skin and orbicularis pal- pebrarum ; it presents one or two small holes for vessels and nerves ; its upper and outer edge is named exter7ml orbitar process, and joins the frontal bone ; its inner end is cut off obliquely and serrated, is attached to and overlaps the maxillary bone, this is the maxillary p-o- cess ; the upper edge is round, smooth, and concave, forms part of the base of the orbit and ends internally in a longangle,named theintcrnalorbitalprocess; thelovver is thick and uneven, and gives attachment to the masse- ter muscle, it ends posteriorly in the zygomatic pro~ cess, which passes backwards, and tern)inates in a ser- rated edge which supports the zygomatic process of the temporal bone ; behind this the malar bone is smooth, and forms part of the temporal fossa ; from the poste- rior surface a thin plate extends into the orbit, and is named the internal orbital process ; the posterior edge of this is notched to close the spheno maxillaiy fissure anteriorly. The malar bone is thick, strong, and cellu- lar ; it is well developed in the foetus. It is joined to four bones, the frontal, sphenoid, temporal, and superior maxillary ; the processes are five, the superior, inferior, and internal orbital, the malar, and zygomatic ; the fo- ramina are two or three proper and one common. The Superior Maxillary Bone is of a very irrefrular figure and attached to all the bones of the face; it forms part of the front of the face, a portion of theâ€™or- bit, nose and palate; it may be divided into the body and processes. The body is concave anteriorly, to form the infra-orbital or canine fossa, in the upper part of which is the infra-orbital hole; it is bounded exter- nally and above by a rough serrated surface, the 'malar process, which is smooth and hollowed out be- hind for the temporal muscle ; springing from the inner and upper part of the body, is the nasal process of a py- ramidal form, perforated by one, or two small holes for vessels, serrated above to join the os frontis, prominen*- below, slightly grooved anteriorly'to receive the nasal bone and the alar cartilage, and deeply grooved behind Q Q

76 the serous membrane which lines the vascular system, internally ; and 3dly, between these membranes a lami- na of muscular substance: the serous membranes are stronger, but the muscular tunic weaker in the auricles than in the ventricles j the muscular fibres are arranged chiefly in a spiral direction, but they are so closely united that their course is not obvious, unless after long mace- ration ; external to this tunic, in the adult or old, and on the right side principally, we generally find a quantity of adeps placed. The coats of the heart are supplied with blood from the two coronary arteries, the first branches of the aorta: the nerves of the heart are small and numerous, they are derived from the cervical gang- lions of the sympathetic, and from the pneumo-gastric of each side.â€”(See Vascular and Nervous Systems.) The student may next examine what are the parts which pass through the uijper orifice of the thorax. Posterior to the deep cervical fascia we perceive the sterno-hyoid and thyroid muscles first ascending through this opening: behind these is a quantity of cellular mem- brane, and the remains of the thymus gland ; next are the right and lejt vence innominatcB, the former descend- ing perpendicularly, the latter obliquely across this opening ; these two veins unite opposite the cartilage of the 2d rib of the right side, and form the superior vena cava, which soon enters the pericardium, and empties itself into the right auricle; behind these veins, the phrenic and par vagum enter the chest; the former is external and anterior to the latter, and both are anterior to the subclavian arteries. The phrenic nerve, accom- panied by the internal mammary vessels, descends through the thorax, anterior to the root of the lungs, to the diaphragm, to which it is distributed; this nerve on the left side is longer, and lies somewhat posterior to that on the right side; the Sth pair entering the chest, between the subclavian vein and artery, passes back- wards behind the root of the lung, on which it forms an extensive plexus, pulmonary p>lcxus; it then enters the posterior mediastinum, and becomes attached to the oesophagus, which conducts it to the stomach. Ve next perceive the innominata, left carotid, and left sub- clavian arteries ascending out of this cavity; the inno-

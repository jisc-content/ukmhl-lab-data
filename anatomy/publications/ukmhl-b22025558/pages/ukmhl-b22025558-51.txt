41 nares, and on the side of each of these is the opening of the Eustachian tube; below the velum is the isthmus faucium, or posterior opening of the mouth; below and behind the tongue is the opening of the glottis; and lastly, the termination of the pharynx in the oesopha- gus. The opeiiing of the nares are of an oval shape, their long diameter being vertical; the body of the sphenoid bone bounds them superiorly, the palate bones inferiorly, the internal pterygoid plates externally, and the vomer separates them from each other: through these openings the air generally passes during respira- tion. The Eicstacliia7i tubes open on each side of the posterior nares, behind the inferior spongy bone ; they are circular, and look forwards and inwards towards the septum narium, are formed of thick cartilage, covered by mucous membrane ; through these air is admitted from the nose into the tympanum, to support the mem- brana tympani on its inner side. The Eustachian tube must be again examined in the dissection of the organ of hearing.* Beneath the velum is the isthmus faucium, transversely oval, but capable of great change in figure and size, bounded above by the velum and uvula, below b}' the tongue, and on either side by the pillars or arches of the palate, and by the amygdalae. The opening of the glottis, or superior opening of the larynx, is at the lower and anterior part of the pharynx, behind the epi- glottis, and rather beneath the tongue; it is of a trian- gular form, the base anteriorly, formed by the epi- glottis; the sides are composed of folds of mucous mem- brane, termed aryteno-epiglottidean, and the apex, which is posteriorly, is formed by the appendices of the arytenoid cartilages. The glottis, which will again be considered in speaking of the larynx, is always open, except in the act of deglutition. The cesophageal open- ing is below and behind the glottis ; it is always closed, except in deglutition. The student should next exa- mine the velum pendulum palati, or palatum molle. â€¢ The student may practise the introduction of a probe into tliis tube; slightly curve a blunt probe, pass it along the lloorof the nose to the posterior nares, then direct its extremity upwards, outwards, and backwards, that is towards the ear, and it will enter this tube.

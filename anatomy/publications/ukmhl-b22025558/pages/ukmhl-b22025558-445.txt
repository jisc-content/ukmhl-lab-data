435 form, a sharp angular ridge to which the tentorium cerebelli is attached, separates its two surfaces, one looks forwards and upwards, the other backwards and inwards; on the superior vve observe anteriorly a slight depression which corresponds to the Gasserian ganglion of the fifth pair of nerves; leading from this is a delicate groove which conducts to a small opening, the hiatus Fallopii, through which the superior branch of the vidian nerve passes in order to enter the aqueduct of Fallopius,- the remainder of this surface is marked by the convolutions of the brain, and by the eminence of the superior semicircular canal ; on the posterior sur- face is the meatus auditorius internus, through which pass the two portions of the seventh pair of nerves, it is directed forwards and outwards, is lined by dura mater, and is terminated abruptly by a vertical bony process, beneath which is a sort of cribriform plate, through this the auditory nerves pass, and above this the portio dura enters the aqueduct of Fallopius ; the latter is a very long canal, which leads outwards and downwards behind the tympanum; the hiatus Fallopii and some canals from the tympanum open into it, it ends in the stylo-mastoid foramen ; behind the meatus is a small depression lined by dura mater, and posterior to this is a narrow short slit in which the canal of the vestibule ends, from this slit a groove descends to the jugular opening. The petrous bone contains within it the complicated apparatus of the organ of hearing which has been already described. The temporal bone is connected to five bones, the parietal, malar, sphe- noid, occipital, and inferior maxillary, and in some to the os hyoides; in the foetus it consists of two por- tions the squamous and petrous, the latter is large and well developed, and the ossicula auditus which it contains are perfect, and nearly as large as in the adult, the mastoid portion is not formed, the styloid })rocess is cartilaginous, and is distinct from the rest of the bone, the external auditory meatus is wanting, a bony ring supplies' its place and encircles the tympa- num. The processes enumerated are five, viz. the ina.sioid, auditory, zygomatic, styloid, and vaginal; the holes are ten proper and two common ; the proper are, the external auditory, glenoidal, stylo-mastoid, mastoid,

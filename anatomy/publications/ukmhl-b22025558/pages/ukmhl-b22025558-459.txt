449 joined to the maxillary, inferior spongy, vomer, sphe- noid, and aethmoid, and to the opposite palate bone; it is composed of thin compact substance, and is well torraed in the foetus ; its processes are seven, palate, na- sal, pterygoid, orbital, sphenoidal posterior nasal spiras and crest; its foramina are one proper and two com- mon. The proper is the posterior palatine hole or holes; the common are the posterior palatine or pterygo- maxillary canal and the spheno-palatine hole; the latter is above the nasal plate, below the body of the sphenoid, and between the orbital processes of the palate bone, it transmits the nasal nerve and artery from the sphe- no-maxillary fossa into the nose. The Inferior Spongy or Turbinated Bone, placed on the lower part of the outer side of the nose, elongated from before backwards, it presents a wrinkled or a surface, convex towards the nose, concave out- wards, its lower edge is loose, spongy, and curled out. wards; the upper edge is uneven, thin, and joined to the unguis, and to the maxillary and palate bones; it is connected to the unguis by a thin pyramidal process which completes the nasal duct; it is also in general united to the descending oblique process of the mth- moid, it is composed of very thin brittle substance mark, ed with pores and little spines. The Os Unguis or Lachrymal Bone is placed at the inner and forepart of the orbit; below the os fronds, behind the nasal process of the superior maxillary and before the aethmoid bone, it is of an oblong square shape, and very thin, it covers the anterior ethmoidal cells ; externally it is divided by a perpendicular ridge, which terminates below in a little hook-like processâ€™ into two unequal plates, the posterior or orbital plate is short and broad, the anterior lachrymal plate is concave, long and narrow, and forms part of the lachrymal or nasal fossa and duct. The os unguis is joined above to the internal angular and orbitar processes of the os fron- tis ; behind to the os planum of the aethmoid, below to the orbitar plate of the maxillary, before to the nasal process of the same, and before and below to the in- ferior spongy bone; its structure is very thin but com, pact.

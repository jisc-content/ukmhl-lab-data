68 connected, inferiorly, to the central division of the cor- diform tendon of the diaphragm, and to some of its fleshy portion between the central and the left divisions of that tendon ; anteriorly, to the pleurae, and to the parts contained in the anterior mediastinum ; poste- riorly, to the CESophagus and to the other parts in the posterior mediastinum ; superiorly, it is continued along the outer coat of the great vessels, while the serous layer is reflected on these towards the heart. On each side it is in a similar manner connected to the pulmo- nary vessels; the pleura and the phrenic nerve also are attached to it in this situation. The connexion be- tween it and the tendon of the diaphgram, particularly towards its fore part, is very intimate ; in the adult they are almost inseparable, not so however in the foetus. Open this bag, and we shall see that it is lined throughout by a smooth serous membrane, which if we trace to the superior part of the sac we shall perceive to be reflected on the vena cava on the right side, on the aorta in the middle, and on the pulmonary artery on the left side; on these three vessels it descends to- wards the heart: there is a longer portion of the aorta covered by the serous membrane than of the vena cava or pulmonary artery, which two are nearly equal in this respect. The serous layer is reflected on the superior cava, opposite the entrance of the vena azygos; as it descends along that vessel it nearly surrounds it, except a small portion of it posteriorly; from the vena cava it continues to the right auricle, which it covers anteriorly and on the right side; from this it passes on the right pulmonary veins, covers these partially, and is thence reflected to the fibrous layer; from the lower part of the right auricle it is continued partly round the infe- rior cava, and from it also it is reflected to the fibrous layer. On the aorta the serous layer descends at first on the forepart, afterwards on its sides and back part, so as to encircle it ; near the heart it passes Iroin it over the pulmonary artery, so as to connect these vessels to each other, leaving of course uncovered so much of each as are in apposition ; along these vessels the serous membrane descends to the ventricles, and having co- vered all the anterior surface of the heart, it turns

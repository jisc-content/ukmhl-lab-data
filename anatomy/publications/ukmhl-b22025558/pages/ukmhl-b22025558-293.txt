•283 dulla oblongata to its lower extremity, from which it is distinguished by a deep groove: the pons is of a more firm structure than any part of the brain, its surface is white and fibrous; the superficial layer of fibres run transversely from one crus cerebelli to the other, hence the pons has been named the commissure of the cere- bellum; beneath this lamina of transverse fibres a quan- tity of cineritious substance exists, through which white fibrous substance may be seen to ascend obliquely out- wards, in the direction of the crura cerebri. The pons Remove the posterior lobes of the cerebrum, divide" the tentorium, and the cerebellum will be exposetl; transversely oval, raised in the centre, divided int,o rwht and left hemispheres by a deep groove posteriorly and inferiorly, which receives the falx cerebelli, and by a broad notch anteriorly, which is behind the fourth ven- tricle; the upper surface of each hemisphere is nearly fiat, and is marked by a great number of narrow lines which run semicircularly, convex posteriorly; these are fissures into which the pia mater descends, the arach- noid membrane juissing over them ; these fissures are analogous to those in the cerebrum; they are involu- tiotis of the grey substance, the superficial extent of which is thus considerably augmented: the same ap- pearance is also observable inferiorly ; the lines, how- ever, are not so numerous or regular as above ; some lines pass in very deep into the cerebellum, and’divide it into lobes, others are only superficial, and divide it into lobules; the inferior surface of each hemisphere is very convex, and fills the inferior occipital fossm. Along the circumference of each hemisphere a deep fissure extends, at the bottom of which a white cord is observed; this is the cr«.s cerc^e//i which ascends ob- liquely forwards and inwards to join the pons Varolii;

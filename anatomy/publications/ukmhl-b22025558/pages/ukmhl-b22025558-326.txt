316 eighth passes out above the first dorsal vertebra. All these nerves immediately outside the inter-vertebral foramina, divide into a posterior and an anterior branch; the posterior of each is smaller than the anterior, with the exception of the second cervical nerve, whose pos- terior branch is very considerable, as it not only sup- plies the adjacent muscles, but also accompanies the occipital artery and its ramifications in the scalp ; the posterior branches of the other cervical nerves are small, they all communicate with each other, and are distributed to the integuments and muscles on the back part of the neck. The anterior branch of the first or the sub-occipital passes forwards above the transverse process of the atlas, and supplies the adjoining small recti muscles, then descends before the atlas, and unites with the anterior division of the second cervical, so as to encircle that bone with a nervous loop; in this course the sub-occipital is united by branches to the eighth and ninth, and to the superior ganglion of the sympathetic nerve; with the latter nerve the anterior branches of all the spinal nerves regularly communicate. The anterior branch of the second having received that from the first, descends and joins the anterior di- vision of the third, this in like manner is connected to the fourth; these anastomoses between the anterior branches of the four superior cervical nerves constitute the cervical plexus; the anterior branches of the four inferior cervical are much larger than those of the su- perior ; they are united in like manner to each other, and to the anterior branch of the first dorsal, and con- stitute the brachial plexus ; these two plexuses and their branches the student may next dissect. The Cervical Plexus is formed by the anterior branches of the four superior cervical nerves, which join each other in arches, from the convexities of which branches arise that again join in a similar manner, a quantity of cellular membrane is entangled in the are- olae between these; this plexusjs situated on the side of the neck, on a level with the 2d, 3d, and 4th verte- brae, between the sterno mastoid and trapezius muscles ; it sends off several branches which may be classed into ascending and descending ; the former consist of su-

384 the dorsal vertebrae and of the aorta, receiving the in- tercostal veins from each side, also the oesophageal and bronchial; at the 4-th vertebra it curves forwards round the root of the right lung, and opens into the back part of the vena cava. The veins of the lower extremity are superficial and deep ; the former^ the internal and external sa- phena ; the external passes from the dorsum of the foot behind the external malleolus, ascends along the back of the leg to the ham, and joins the popliteal vein ; the internal saphena commences on the upper and inner part of the foot, ascends in front of the inner ankle along the inner side of the leg, and behind the internal condyle of the knee; it then inclines to the internal and anterior part of the thigh, and as- cends to within about two inches of Pbupart’s liga- ment, it theu passes througli the saphenic opening in the fascia lata and joins the femoral vein ; the deep vehis of the leg accompany the arteries, two with each, they terminate in the popliteal vein, which ascends su- perficial and external to the artery; this vein then receives the name of femoral, and is closely connected to the artery, lying posterior to it belo-v, and on its inner side above ; this then passes behind the crural arch and becomes the external iliac, which lies internal and rather posterior to the accompanying artery ; op- posite the ilio-sacral symphysis this is joined by the internal iliac vein, which arises from the union of the several veins that accompanied the branches of the internal iliac artery; the union ot the external and internal iliac veins constitute the common iliac which ascends on each side towards the right side of the 4th lumbar vertebra, and unite to form the iirferior vena cava; the left common iliac vein is longer than the right,’ and runs obliquely across the _ spine ; both are posterior to the corresponding arteries. The inferior vena cava ascends along the right side of the lumbar vertebrae, on the psoas and left crus of the diaphragm, to the liver, passes through a grove in this organ be- tw6en the right and middle lobes, and then through the large quadrangular opening in the tendon of the diaphragm, perforates the pericardium, and opens into

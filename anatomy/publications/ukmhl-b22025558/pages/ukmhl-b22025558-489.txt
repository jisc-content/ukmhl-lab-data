APPENDIX. DIRECTIONS FOR OPENING THE HEAD. The most common period of the dissection for open- ing the head, is, when the student has examined the attachments of the occipito-frontalis, corrugator super- cilii and temporal muscles, parts most likely to be in- jured in the operation ; having made a transverse divi- sion of the fibres of the last named muscles, about an inch above the zygoma and any other soft parts that may be adhering; a block should then be placed un- der the shoulders of the subject, which allows the head to hang down ; let the student (having provided himself with a heavy hammer, strong in the claws) take hold of the head in his left hand, and with the right commence striking steadily, beginning about half an inch above the superciliary ridge, and continuing it round on a line with the incisions in the temporal mus- cle, terminating a little above the occipital ridge. No danger is to be apprehended of wounding the brain in this proceeding, although the student should be careful not to strike so heavily on the temporal or parietal bones as he may on the frontal or occipital, the former being of a much more brittle texture : when you have ascertained that no part of the bone remains unbroken, and have divided the pericranium with a scissors; your next step is to fix the claws of the hammer in the bro- ken part of the frontal bone, and with a steady pull tear the skull from the dura mater. This operation requires less labour and time than that done with a saw, and ought always to be preferred, except in cases -vyhere there is a wish to preserve the skull, or in private houses, where the feelings of the relatives are likely to be offended by the noise made with the hammer. When the saw is used, the head is to be placed on a block, the cut is to be carried round in the same direction, and the same precautions observed as described in using the

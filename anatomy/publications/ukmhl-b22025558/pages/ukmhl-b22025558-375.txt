365 The Vertebral Artery, arises from the upper and back part of the subclavian : ascends behind the inferior th}'- roid artery, enters the foramen in the transverse pro- cess ot the 5th or 6th cervical vertebra, and ascends through the several foramina in the superior vertebrae as high as the second; it then bends backwards and outwards ; passes through the foramen in the transverse process of the atlas; it then turns backwards and in- wards, round the articulation of this vertebra with the condyle, and pierces the dura mater; it then ascends obliquely inwards and forwards between the olivary and pyramidal bodies, and at the lower edge of the pons it unites with the opposite, to form the basilar artery; in this course it gives small branches to the spinal nerves and to the inter-vertebral muscles; at the foramen mag- num it gives off, 1st and 2d, the posterior and anterior spinal arteries, which descend all along the spinal cord ; 3rd, the injerior cerebellar artery often arises from the basilar ; it runs tortuously around the medulla oblon- gata, below the vagus, and sends its numerous branches to the inferior surface of the cerebellum. The basilar aHery, is formed by the confluence of the two vertebral; it ascends in the median groove ou the pons varolii, sends'small branches to the surround- ing membrane, and at the upper edge of that body it divides into four branches, two for each side, 1st, the superior cerebellar artery, passes outwards and back- wards, to the upper surface of each hemisphere of the cerebellum on which it spreads its branches; 2d, the posterior cerebral artery, this receives the posterior branch of the internal carotid, bends backwards and outwards, and spreads its ramifications on the posterior lobe of the cerebral hemisphere. (See page The thyroid axis, arises from the upper part of the subclavian close to the scalenus and phrenic nerve, it immediately divides into the four following branches: 1st, the injerior thyroid, ascends tortuously behind the common carotid, then bends downwards and inwards sends branches to the trachea, oesophagus, &c. and is distributed to the thyroid gland, in which it inoscu- lates with the superior thyroid, and with the arteries I I 2

443 lianâ€™ riilgcs of the os-frontis to tlie roots of the pte- rygoid processes of the os-sphenoides ; it presents the nasal spine and process of the os-frontis, tlie aethmoid bone, tlie orbital plates of the os-frontis, bounded by its angular processes before, and by the orbitar plates of the sphenoid behind ; in this division are the su- pra-orbital, the anterior and posterior orbital holes, the openings of the frontal and fethmoid cells, the optic and lacerated holes of the orbits, tlie vidian canals and the foramina rotunda. The middle division extends from the roots of the pterygoid to the styloid processes of the temporal bones, it presents the azygos process, the basilar process of the os-occipiti's, the anterior points of the petrous portions of the temporal bones; the spinous processes of the sphenoid, and the glenoid ca- vities of the temporal bones. The holes in this division are the oval, spinous, carotid, external, auditory glenoi- dal, and the Eustachian tubes. The fosta-ior division extends from the styloid processes of the temporal to the tuberosity of the occipital bone ; it presents the fora- men magnum, the two condyles, the jugular ridge, the styloid processes of the temporal bones, surrounded by their vaginal processes, the mamillary processes, the digastric pits, the inferior and superior transverse arches, the spine, protuberance and pits of the occipi- tal bone : the foramina in this division are the si_y- lo-mastoid, mastoid, magnum, lacera postica, anterior and posterior condyloid. I'he skull is divided internally into the arch or vault and the base; on the vault is to be observed the sulcus for the longitudinal sinus, the frontal crest, the grooves for the middle-arteries of the dura mater, the depi-es- sions for the convolutions of the brain, and for the gra- nulations or glandulae pacchionae ; the base of the skull is very uneven, and presents three portions on different planes, the anterior or frontal, the middle or spheno- temporal, and the posterior or occipital; the 1st is form- ed of the orbital plates of the frontal bone, the cribri- form plate of the ethmoid, and the lesser wings of the sphenoid; the foramina in this division are the ctECurn, olfactory, and optic. The 2nd division is bounded before by the transverse spinous processes of the sphenoid, on

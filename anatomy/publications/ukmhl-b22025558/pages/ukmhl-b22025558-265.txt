'255 astragalus, which substance supports a great portion oi the weight of the body in standing or in progression. Flexor Pollicis Longus, arises from the two in- leiior thirds of the fibula, by fleshy fibres, which de- scends obliquely inwards to a tendon which passes be- hind the internal malleolus through a groove first in the tibia, and next in the astragalus; entering the sole of the foot this tendon crosses above the flexor communis, and is connected to it by a tendinous slip, it then pro- ceeds forwards and inwards, between the two portions of the flexor pollicis brevis, enters a tendinous sheath, and is inserted into the last phalanx of the great toe. Use, to flex this toe, to extend the ankle and adduct the foot ; this muscle lies to the fibular side of the tibi- alis posticus, between it and the peronaei muscles ; as it passes behind the internal ankle it is about half an inch behind the tendons of the tibialis posticus and the flexor communis, and is separated from these by the poste- rior tibial nerve and vessels. SECTION V. DISSECTION OF THE MUSCLES OF THE FOOT. There is but one muscle on the dorsum or on the upper surface of the foot, the extensor digitorum brevis which has bec-n already examined, as being a sort of appendix to, or continuation of the long extensors of the toes which arise from the bones of the leo- The integuments and fascia in the sole of the foot have been already noticed; the muscles here are very numerous tiiey may be divided into four laminae, these are tolera* niy distinct about the middle of this region, buftit either side this arrangement is rather artificial ;â€™the two inter-muscular processes of the plantar fascia also di- vide these muscles into three compartments, an inter- i nal, a middle, and an external. The muscles of the irst or superficial layer, are the abductor pollicis flexor digitorum brevis, and abductor minimi digiti: in

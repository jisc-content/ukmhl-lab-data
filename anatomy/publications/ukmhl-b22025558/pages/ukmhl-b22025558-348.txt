338 and the sphenoid sinus open ; each naris opens poste- riorly into the pharynx, above the velum, by an oblong oval opening; these are separated from each other by the vomer, the internal pterygoid plates bound them externally, the sphenoid above and the palate bones below. To the anterior edge of each naris the cartila- ‘res composing the alae nasi are attached, these are five in number, one in the centre, two at each side ; the central cartilage is triangular and vertical, attached superiorly and posteriorly to the bony septum, its anterior edge is thick and sub-cutaneous, and at- tached on either side to the lateral cartilages : the lateral cartilages are two, one superior and triangular, attached to bone, the other inferior, and irregularly curved, convex externally, and attached to the pre- ceding and to the septum; in the ala? nasi small pieces of cartilage also may be noticed distinct from the larger cartilages. All the internal surface of the nose and of the sinuses communicating with it, are lined by a soft, vascular, and highly sensible mucous mem- brane ; this is the pituitary or Schneiderian membrane : this mucous membrane is continous anteriorly with the integuments ; it adheres to all the internal surtace of the bones of the nose, lines the sinuses, is continuous through the nasal duct with the membrana conjunctiva of each orbit; round the lower extremity of each duct it forms a slight circular fold; and posteriorly it ^ con- tinuous with the membrane of the pharynx and Eusta- chian tubes; this membrane adheres inseparably to the periosteum ; it is villous, very vascular, soft and thick In the septum and turbinated bones ; at the extremities of the latter it forms thick fleshy-looking folds or bps, fn the sinuses it is pale and thin; it is constantly moistened with a mucous secretion ; mucous glands a.e Z distinct in it; the olfactory or first pair of nerves are distributed to it in the form of numerous plexuses, it is also supplied with branches from the ophtha micand su- oerior Inaxillary divisions of the 5th pair ; the first pair ^re generally believed to endow the membrane with the pillar s^sibility of spelling; Magente i™ - recently made some experiments to prove that me branches of the 5th pair are accessory to this function.

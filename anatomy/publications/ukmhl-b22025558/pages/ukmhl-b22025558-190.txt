Use ; to flex the thigh on the pelvis, or the body on the thigh; it also rotates the thigh out- wards ; in standing it supports the spine, and prevents it bending backwards, and in walking it is particularly engaged; it then raises, throws forwards and outwards the lower extremity. This muscle is situated between the psoas parvus and the quadratus lumborum above, and between the former muscle and the iliacus below ; and in the groin, between the sartorius and the pecti- naeus : its insertion is between the vastus internus and the pectinaeus; it is covered in the lumbar region by the diaphragm, the kidney, and its vessels; also on the right side by the vena cava, and on the left by tbe aor- ta ; in the middle or pelvic division of its course it lies between the external iliac vessels and the iliac muscle and the anterior crural nerve ; in its lower or inguinal division it is partly covered by the femoral artery and nerve, and by some of their branches, also by the in- guinal glands, and by a considerLble quantity of cellular membrane. The psoas lies anterior to the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae, to the quadratus lumborum, the lumbar nerves, the inner edge ot the iliacus internus, and the capsular ligament ot the hip ; the lumbar nerves or the lumbar plexus m general run through the psoas, perforating its posterior portion; a large bursa separates its tendon from the pubes and from the capsular ligament; this bursa sometimes com- municates with the synovial membrane of the hip joint. A smaller bursa lies between the point of the lesser trochanter and this tendon. The tendon ot the psoas is formed in the outer or iliac side of the muscle, and receives the insertion of the fibres of the iliacus mter- ""iLiacus Internus, fl it, or concave, radiated or tri- angular, arises fleshy fl om the transverse P'^^cess o last lumbar vertebra, from the inner â„¢a;;gm o three anterior fourths of the crest ot the ilium trom the tuo anterior spinous processes, and from the "J^ervemrig notch, from the brim of the acetabulum and from th capsular ligament, also from the f the strong aponeurosis, the ihac fascia, which cove s it The iliac fascia is attached to the ciest ot t

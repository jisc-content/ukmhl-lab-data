471 external lateral ligament, and to the supinator and ex- tensor muscles ; between these condyles is an articu- lating surface turned forwards and presenting externally a small round head whicli articulates with the radius, above and internal to which is a slight depression cor- responding to the margin of the radius, internal to this is a sharp semicircular ridge which separates the radius and ulna, and next to this is the trochlea for articula- tion with the ulna, this is so much below the level of the small head and of the outer portion of the articular surface, as to give the whole bone an oblique direction outw'ards when its lower end is placed on a horizontal plane; at the anterior extremity of this trochlea is a small depression for the reception of the coronoid pro- cess in flexion of the joint, and at the posterior is a large fossa which lodges the olecranon process in the ex- tended state of the forearm. The humerus, like the femur, is compact in the structure of its body, and cellular in that of its extremities, it contains a large medullary canal, and is developed from eight points of ossification, one for the head, one for each tuberosity, one for the shaft, one for the trochlea, one for the small head, and one for each condyle. Ijlua is situated at the inner side of the forearm, it is longer than the radius, and is divided into the body and two extremities ; the upper extremity is larger than the lower, and presents two processes and an interven- ing cavity ; the posterior process, or the olecranon, is tlie highest part of the bone, its superior border gives attachment to the triceps extensor, posteriorly it pre- sents a smooth triangular surface, covered by skin and by a bursa ; anteriorly it is concave, and covered with cartilage; the coronoid process is anterior and inferior to the preceding ; anteriorly it gives insertion to the brachialis anticus muscle, internally to the flexors and pronators, and to the internal lateral liga- ment ; and externally it is hollowed out into the lesser sigmoid cavity, which receives the head of the radius ; this cavity is oval, its greatest diameter being from before backwards, it leads superiorly into ihe great sig- moid cavity, which moves on the trochlea of the hume-

324 first lumbar ; all these anterior branches of the dorsal nerves opposite the neck of each rib are connected by one or two short branches to the ganglions of the sym- pathetic. Lumbar Nerves ; of these there are five pair, they are larger than the dorsal, like them they divide into posterior and anterior branches; the posterior are dis- tributed to the lumbar muscles ; the anterior branches unite with each other in the substance of the psoas and form the lumbar plexus; this long and somewhat trian- gular plexus is situated along the sides of the four infe- rior lumbar vertebrae: it communicates above with the last dorsal and below with the first sacral, and divides into the following branches; inguino-cutaneous, ante- rior crural, obturator and lumbo-sacral. The inguino- cutaneous are generally three in number ; they descend from the two first lumbar nerves, pass through the psoas, and descend behind the peritonaeum ; the Jirst or the external descends obliquely outwards over the quadratus lumborum muscle to the middle of the crest of the ilium, it then sends several branches to the ab- dominal muscles, and divides into a cutaneous branch which passes to the integuments on the outer part of the thigh and into the external spermatic nerve which passes beneath the internal oblique muscle, attaches it- self to the spermatic cord, and distributes its branches to the, cremaster muscle and to the scrotum, in the male, or to the round ligam.ent and labium, in the fe- male ; the second, or the middle ingumo-cutaneous, de- scends internal to the last, pierces the abdominal mus- cles close to the anterior superior spine of the ilium, and is distributed to the skin on the outer part of the thigh ; the third or internal inguino-cutaneous descends internal to the last, and divides near Poupart’s liga- ment into two branches; one accompanies the sperma- tic vessels and is lost on the cord, the other follows the crural vessels and is lost in the integuments and glands of the groin. The anterior crural nerve arises in the lumbar plexus from the four superior nerves; it per- forates the psoas, descends obliquely outwards along its external side, on the iliacus internus, covered by the iliac fascia, and passes beneath Poupart’s ligament

329 it is subcutaneous; it communicates superiorly with filaments from the cutaneous branch of the sciatic plexus and with the external cutaneous branches of the peronaeal nerve; about the middle of the leg it is increased in size, and accompanies the external saphena vein to the external malleolus, behind which it passes ; it then curves forwards along the outer edge of the foot, communicating with the external dorsal nerves of the foot and supplying the integuments and muscles on the outer side of this region. In the ham, the posterior tibial nerve gives off several very large muscular branches to the gastrocnemius, solteus, and plantaris ; and in its course down the leg several eraalJer branches to the deep-seated muscles ; it also sends numerous filaments around the artery ; some very small twigs pass through the inter-osseous space along with the anterior tibial artery and join the anterior ti- bial nerve. The internal plantar nerve is larger than the external; it passes forwards along the inner side of the tarsus above the abductor pollicis, sends many branches to the plantar muscles and to the integuments and arriving near the base of the great toe, divides into four digital branches; the first runs along the tibial side of the first toe ; the second subdivides and supplies the opposed sides of the first and second toes ; the third, in like manner, the second and third toes '; and the fourth the opposed sides of the third and fourth toes : these digital nerves also supply the lumbricales and communicate with the dorsal nerves of the foot! The external plantar nerve passes forwards and out- wards above the flexor brevis to the fifth metatarsal bone, and divides into two branches; one, the super- ficial, supplies the little toe and the outer side of the fourth ; the deep branch passes obliquely inwards across the metatarsus, and supplies the inter-ossei and the other deep plantar muscles. r T 2

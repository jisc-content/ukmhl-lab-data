355 being enclosed in a fine membrane, it lias a gelatinous consistence; this membrane is called hyaloid, it en- closes the fluid, and sends processes into it, so as to di\ide the whole mass into numerous cells, which com- municate so freely that air injected will rapidly distend them; or if one or two openings be made in this cap- sule, the whole of the fluid will gradually escape; an- teriorly the crystalline lens is connected to this humour by the hyaloid membrane separating into two Jaminte • external to the lens, the ciliary processes and the in- tervening pigment mark it in a striated manner, like the disk of a flower; this appearance, therefore, has been called the ciliary disk, or corona ciliaris: the vi- treous humour serves to supjrort and expand the retina and the other tunics of the eye, also, in transmitting the rays of light from the lens, it prevents their too rapid convergence, and thus causes an image of larfi-er size to be painted on the retina. “ SECTION V. OF THE SKIN. The integument of the body is composed of one continued membrane, w’hich is very dense, at the same time very extensible; at the several orifices, it is con- tinuous with the mucous membranes, a vascular line alone marks the distinction between them : by macera- tion or putrefaction the skin may be divided into three laminae the cuticle, rete mucosum, and cutis vera 1 be cul/cle or epidermis is the external layer of the skin. It IS dry, thin, and transparent, and destitute of nerves and vessels, it is most intimately connected to the cutis by numerous fine hairs which pass through it also by the several exhalant and absorbent vessels tha[ open on its surface by very minute pores; in some Ind fW opaque, as in the hands anti leet; it is continued as a very fine pellicle into tlw. d.fcrcn, orifices, „„d can be .raced for'.a considtablc d ..anee on .he mucous memi.rauos, .|ms, Crem .be |iS I. ex.cnds over .lie iiliaiynx and alone .lie cesoirin as fur u, .be cardiac orifice of .l.c slornacir lea-

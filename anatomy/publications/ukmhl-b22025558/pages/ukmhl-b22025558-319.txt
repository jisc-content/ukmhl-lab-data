309 to tlie muscles of the palate, to the upper part of the pharynx, and to the mucous membrane of the gums ; 3rd, the corda tympani and some accompanying fila- ments to form a plexus which supplies the sub-maxillary gland; 4th, a few branches which descend along the hyo- glossus muscle to communicate with the ninth or the lingual nerve ; 5th, a fasciculus of nerves to the sublin- gual gland, and to the surrounding mucous membrane ; lastly, at the tongue it divides into several branches, some pass deep into the tissue of the tongue, others, which are long and fine, mount towards its surface and are lost in the mucous membrane and the papillae at the anterior part of the tongue., Facial Nerve or Portio Dura of the seventh pair; as this nerve is passing along the aqueduct of Fallopius in the temporal bone it receives superiorly the vidian nerve ; at the back part of the tympanum it sends off that nerve again which then receives the name of corda tympani,* here it also sends otf small twigs to the tensor tympani and stapedius muscles ; as it escapes by the stylo-mastoid foramen it gives off three branches, the posterior auricular, stylo-hyoid, and sub-mastoid ; the first, or i\\Q â€™posterior auricular, bends upwards and backwards behind the cartilage of the ear, to which it sends several long branches, others also pass backwards to the integuments covering the mastoid process and occipital bone ; the second, or the stplo-hyoid nerve, is distributed to the digastric and styloid muscles, and anastomoses with the sympathetic and glosso-pharyn- geal nerves; the third, or the sub-mastoid branch, per- forates the posterior belly of the digastric, supplies it with several filaments, and then communicates with the glasso-pharyngeal nerve around the jugular vein close to the base of the cranium, other filaments descend and join the laryngeal branches of the pneumo-gastric nerve. The facial nerve then turns forwards across the external carotid mtery and through the parotid gland; in this substance it divides into two large branches, the superior or larger is called temporo-facial ; the inferior, which IS smaller, the ccrvico-facial; these two branches take different directions, but are still connected toge- ther by cross branches which interlace with each other

Tlie Os Ilium is situated at the upper and outer part of the pelvis, and forms that projection com- monly called tlie hip ; it is broad, flat, and triangular, the base above, and semicircular, the apex below form- ing the upper and outer part of the acetabulum ; it ma}'" be divided into the body, alae. and processes. The bod^ is tlie inferior constricted portion which presents three surfaces, one external, smooth and concave, forms the , upper and outer side of the acetabulum ; the second is anterior, small, triangular, and united to the pubis; the third is posterior and joined to the ischium. The a/a is the broad fan-like portion which ascends, inclines outwards and a little forwards ; its external surface or dorsum is irregularly convex, rough, and marked by two curved lines from which the glutaeus raedius and mi- nimus arise; above and behind the upper line the bone is rough for the origin of the glutaeus maximus; the inter- na! surface of the ala is divided into tliree parts; one superior and anterior, is the iliac fossa, which gives origin to the internal iliac muscle; tlie second is pos- terior, rough, and united to the sacrum, and the third is smooth and small, and is the only portion of the iiium that enters into the side of the true pelvis; this pelvic portion of the ilium is above the sciatic notch, and is separated from the fossa by an obtuse ridge which is continuous behind with the promontory of the sacrum, and before with a similar ridge of the pubis; this line is named ilio-pectinea, and into the iliac por- tion of it the tendon of the psoas parvus and the iliac fascia are inserted. The processes are, first the crest, whicli in the young subject is an epipli3'sis, it forms the upper border of the ala, it is curved inwards before and outwards behind, and gives attachment to the three layers of abdominal muscles. Second, anterior superior spine, is that prominent projection at the upper and forepart of the crest and ala, it gives attachment to the muscles and to Poupartâ€™s ligament; between this and the next process is a notch ; third, inferior spine is above o 0

472 rus in flexion and extension of the forearm; this sig- moid cavity has a great resemblance to the letter c, if viewed in profile ; it is covered with cartilage ; its pos- terior vertical portion is larger than the anterior hori- zontal ; it is divided by a middle ridge into two lateral portions, of which the internal is the larger; these are each again divided by a transverse furrow, which ends in a notch at either margin. The body of the ulna is divided into three surfaces by three lines ; these surfaces are larger above than below;, the anterior is slightly grooved for the flexor profundus, and presents supe- riorly a vascular foramen, directed obliquely upwards; the internal surface is broad and concave above, and covered by muscles, below it is round and subcutaneous; the posterior surface is irregular; it is divided into two portions by a prominent line; of these the superior and internal is broad, and gives attachment to the anconaBus; the inferior and outer portion is long and narrow, and covered by the extensors of the thumb; the anterior edge is round, and gives insertion to the flexor profun- dus and pronator quadratus ; the posterior edge is very distinct above, and gives attachment to an aponeuro- sis, common to the flexor profundus and flexor and extensor carpi ulnaris; the external edge is sharp for the three superior fourths, and gives attachment to the in- terosseous ligament. The loiver or caryal end of the ulna is small and round, and presents two eminences; the external is named the head, it is round, and covered with cartilage, and is received into the cavity in the inner border of the radius, and is contiguous inferiorly with the fibre cartilage of the wrist; the interna! emi- nence or the styloid jirocess is more prominent, and on a level with the posterior surface of the bone; it is conical, elongated, and a little everted ; it gives attach- ment to the internal lateral ligament ot the wrist; these processes are separated posteriorly by a groove for the tendon of the extensor carpi ulnaris, and inferiorly by a depression for the insertion of the triangular fibro cartilage. The ulna is articulated above to the humerus and radius, and below to the radius and interarticular cartilage; it is developed from three points ot ossifica- tion, one for the shaft, and one for each extremity.

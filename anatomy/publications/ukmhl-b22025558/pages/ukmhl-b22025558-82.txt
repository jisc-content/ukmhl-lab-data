72 columnae take various directions, and are all covered by the fine lining membrane of the heart. At the base of this cavity we observe the auricular and arterial opening, the latter is superior, anterior, and to the left side of the former; from the margin of the auricular opening a fold of the lining membrane descends into the ventricle, the inferior loose edge of which divides into three portions, each ending in a very irregularly notched margin, to which the chordae tendineae are at- tached ; these are the tricuspid valves, one division is anterior, the second is posterior on the septum cordis, and the third, which is the largest, is to the left side, and separates the auricular from the arterial opening ; many of the tendinous threads are connected to the dorsum, as well as to the edge of these folds, and cross each other as they run to the carneae column®, dhe use of the tricuspid valves is to prevent the reflu.\ of the blood from the ventricle into the auricle; as the former cavity is being distended, the blood separates the valves from the parietes of the ventricle, and thus be- comes situated on their outer side; when the ventricle then contracts, it presses the blood against these folds, which are thus approximated to each other, and slightly raised against the opening so as to close it, the came® column® at the same time contracting make tense the chord® tendine®, and thus accomplish the two objects, 1st, of completely approximating the valves; and 2d, of preventing their being reversed or thrown up into the auricle. The orifice of the pulmonary artery is small, and situated at the highest point, and at the left extremity of the ventricle, the surface of which becomes smooth as it approaches it; this vessel is connected to the ventricle by the external and internal serous mem- branes of the heart, between which its fibrous coat is connected to the fleshy fibres of tbe ventricle by three roots, convex towards the heart, and marked inter- nally each by a distinct white line; from this arterial opening three folds, the semilunar valves, extend into the vessel, the convex edge ot each is fixed to the white line at each of the roots of the artery; the concave is loose, but thick, and contains in its centre a small tubercle, the corpus arantii, or sesamoideum.

434 digastric muscle, above and behind it is a bole through which a vein and small artery pass; this process is hol- lowed out into cells which communicate with the tym- ])anum, it gives attachment to the sterno-mastoid musle; the cerebral surface is deeply grooved for the lateral sinus. The petrous portion passes from the junction of the mastoid and squamous forwards and inwards into the base of the skull, it is of a triangular form, the base behind and very irregular, with a deep notch which assists the occipital bone in forming the foramen lace- rum posterius; the apex is anterior, contiguous to the body of the sphenoid bone, and completing with it, the foramen lacerum anterius which in the recent state is filled up with cartilage; this bone is peculiarly hard and rugged ; on its inferior surface we remark in front of the foramen lacerum posterius a minute hole which leads to the cochlea, and is named the aqueduct of the cochlea; more anteriorly is the styloid process which descends obliquely inwards and forwards, and gives at- tachment to three muscles; it is surrounded at its base or root by a plate of bone most prominent anteriorly and externally, this is named the vaginal process, it separates the glenoid fossa from the carotid foramen ; behind and outside the styloid process, between it and the mas- toid, is the stylo-mastoid hole or the lower end ot the aqueduct of Fallopius, this transmits the portio dura or the facial nerve; in front of the styloid process is the carotid hole which leads into a canal that winds forwards, upwards, and inwards, and which opens within the cranium above the foramen lacerum ante- rius by the side of the body of the sphenoid bone, it transmits the carotid artery and branches of the sympa- thetic nerve; in front oftlie carotid hole is a flat rougli surface to which the muscles of the palate are attached; the apex of the petrous bone is very irregular, it lies in the foramen lacerum anterius, the internal opening ot the carotid canal is in it; into the angle between the petrous and squamous portions the spinous part of the sphenoid bone is wedged; in this angle there are two lioles separated by a thin lamina of bone, the upper transmits the tensor tympani muscle, the lower is the extremity of the bony part of the Eustachian tube. The superior or cerebral surface presents a prismatic

*233 trochanter; situated partly within the pelvis, partly be- hind the hip joint, nearly parallel to the posterior bor- der of the glutaeiis mininuis ; it arises by three teneli- nous and fleshy fasciculi, from the anterior or concave surface of the 2d, 3d, and 4th divisions of the sacrum ; it also receives a few fibres from the anterior surface of the great sciatic ligament, and from the upi)er and back part of the ilium j the fibres form a thick fleshy belly, which passing through the great sciatic notch, descends obliquely outwards and a little forwards, and is iusei ted by a round tendon into the upper part of the digital fossa, at the root of the great trochanter above the tendons of the gemini and obturator muscles, to which it is connected. Use, to abduct the thigh, to extend and rotate it outwards, it can also act on the capsular ligament in the same manner as the glutteus minimus. Within the pelvis this muscle lies on the sacrum and is covered by the hypogastric vessels, the sciatic plexus of nerves, and the rectum ; the sciatic nerve often perforates it, near its lower margin ; on the dorsum of the pelvis this muscle is covered by the <^[11- t*us maximus, and is parallel to, but not covered^by the glutaeus medius ; it adheres to the capsular lit^a- ment, and is superior to the gemini, from which it is separated by the sciatic nerve and vessels : this muscle uivides the sciatic notch into tvvo parts, through the su- perior pass the glutaeal vessels and nerves, through the inferior the sciatic and pudic vessels, the sciatic nerve and several smaller branches of the sacral plexus of nerves. To expose the following five small rotator mus- cles of the hip joint, draw to either side the great sci- atic nerve, and remove the surrounding loose cellular tissue. Ge.\ielli, two small muscles behind the ilio-femo- ral articulation between the ischium and the trochanter the SUPERIOR ames narrow and fleshy from the spine of the ischium; the fibres pass outwards above the ten- don of the obturator internus, and are inserted with it into the upper part of the digital fossa of the great tro- chanter. Inferior arises also fleshy from the upper part of the tuber ischii, and from the great sciatic li- X 2

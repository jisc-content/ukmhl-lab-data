196 each side; each is continuous with the anterior liga- ment, and is formed by the reflection of the pelvic fas- cia from the inner surface of the levator ani to the side of the prostate gland and of the bladder. The superior and anterior extremity of the bladder is sometimes named the superior fundus ; the posterior extremity, which presses against the rectum, the Jij/e- rior fundus; the intervening portion is called the body, and that part which is connected to the pubes the cer- vix ; the latter is surrounded by the prostate gl^â€˜d> very little, however, of this gland being above it. i he cervix presents somewhat a conical figure ; and in the adult lies nearly horizontal, below and behind the pubes- in the child it is more vertical. If the bladder be moderately distended it will be found to present six regions on each of which some important objectma be noticed. 1st, The superior region, is in contact pos- teriorlv with the convolutions of the small intestines, and anteriorly with the recti abdominis J. are attached the urachus and obliterated umbilical a teries; posterior to these this region is covered by pe- ritoneum, whereas anterior to them this deficient. If the bladder be much distended this le- gion is sometimes found to incline to the left side. 2d and 3d ; The lateral regions, are contiguous to the sides of the pelvis, to the vesical fascia, and to the levatores ani mJscles: descending obliquely backwards along this region on each side, we find the vas deferens cross- ing over the obliterated umbilical artery above, and on ei the ureter below, thus passing internal to to the mesial line ; the peritonaeum adheres to so mucli of Sch lateral region of the bladder as lies pos er.or to l"v?s tuLens fvhiic that portion anter.r to tt ts e- ficient of this serous covering. 4ih, l ie anleno pion is behind the recti muscles, the pubes, the pubic Lament, and the triangular ligament of the ui-ethia^ aU this re^^ion wants the peritonaeal covering, Us inferio? part tve observe the anterior ligaments of the &e':n":b:ner;f:fieh^^^^^^^

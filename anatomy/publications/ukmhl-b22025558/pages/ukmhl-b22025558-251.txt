The posterior tibial nerve ac- companies the popliteal vessels through the space of that name, which space the student should next exa- mine. popliteal sjrace is situated behind the knee-ioirt extending upvvards for about one-fourth of the thigh’ and downwards for about one-sixth of the le<-• it is somewhat oval, is bounded internally by the inner’ham- externally by the biceps, external head of the gastrocne- mius, and the plantaris; it is covered by the inte-u- ments and by a strong fascia, which, derived from the ascia lata, is strengthened by adhering to the condyles of the femur, and to the adjoining tendons ; this fascia serves to approximate the sides of this region, and thus is^fm^ depth. The popliteal space s bounded before by the flat surface of the femur, by f fby the ligament of tl, ’ by the head of the tibia, and byUiepopli- taeus muscle; in this region are contained the termi- nating branches of the sciatic nerve, the popliteal ar- tery and vein with their branches ; also some lymphatic glands and much adipose substance. The nerves are superficial and external to the vessels, that is, nearer 0 the biceps; the vessels are close to the bone and near to the semi membranosus muscle, the vein Leino- superficial and a little to the outer side of the artery^ two or three lymphatic glands are connected to thL latter; and a quantity of fat, which is of a peculiar soft The‘com-se of nerve and vessels, ine couise of the peronseal nerve has been alreadv h’ rierve descends nearly vei^ n of the gastrocnemius, ruL be eath the soiaeus, and over the poplitmus, and then ac companies the posterior tibial vessels down the le^^ and along the inner side of the heel to the sole of the'foot in which course it shall be examined afterwards • in the ham this nerve sends off muscular branches, also Ihe ftie nnT saphetius which accompanies posterior saphena vein along the back of tlfe lec- y

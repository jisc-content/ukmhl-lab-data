261 the first phalanx of the fourth toe. Use, to separate the fourth toe from the three internal. All (he interossei muscles serve to strengthen the metatarsus, to press the metatarsal bones together; they also serve to flex tlie first joint of the four outer toes, and may assist in extending their last phalanges; these muscles can exert no influence on the great toe; there is only one muscle between the two first meta- tarsal bones ; between the others there are two, there- foie there are tour superior or dorsal interossei mus- cles, but three inferior; the latter are situated more m the concavity of each metatarsal bone than between these bones; the superior are stronger and more ten- dinous than the inferior, and are only partially covered by the long and short extensor tendons. In dissecting the muscles on the back of the leg, and those in the sole of the foot, we meet the posterior ti- bial artery and nerve, and their principal branches. 1 he posterior tibicil artery is the larger branch of the popliteal; it descends obliquely inwards beneath the deep fascia and the superficial muscles, and over the tibiahs posticus and flexor communis to the fossa be- tween the heel and inner ankle, it here ends in the two plantar arteries; in this course it gives oft'many muscu- lar branches, also the peronceal artery; the latter arises from the tibial, about an inch below the popli- taeus; it descends obliquely outwards along the back part of the fibula beneath the flexor pollicis lonaus • behind, and a little above the outer ankle, it divides into the anterior and posterior perooEeal arteries • the rormer perforates the interosseous space and joins' the external malleolar artery ; the latter descends between the external ankle and the heel, and is distributed to the ligaments and adipose substance in that region. The two plantar branches of the posterior tibia! ar- tery are distributed to the muscles and integuments ot the foot and toes; the internal plantar is the smaller ot the two. It supplies the muscles along the inner side ot the tarsus; ihe external plantar, the larger branch runs across the foot obliquely outwards, towards the fifth matatarsal bone, between the first and second layers of plantar muscles ; from the little toe it next

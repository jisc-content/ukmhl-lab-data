484 from the condensation of the natural vapour, which exists in all serous cavities, or the oozing out of the serous parts of the blood from the contraction of the heart after death. To examine the valves of the heart, which are in many subjects ossified, the apex of that organ may be cut off, this will expose the cavities of the right and left ventricles; by introducing the fore finger info the right, the tricuspid and semilunar valves of the pulmonary artery may be examined, while the same proceeding in the left will detect whether any disease exists in the mitral or semilunar valves of the aorta ; a ligature tied tightly round the heart above the cut, will prevent any further effusion of blood. Polypi of the heart. In cutting open the heart, large portions of coagulablc lymph are found filling up the ventricles, and passing for some way into the large arteries; these substances were formerly considered as diseased appearances, and called polypi of the heart, but they are now more properly classed with those changes which naturally take place after death, and are accounted nothing more than a simple coagulation of blood. There are many other morbid changes that take place in the sttucture of this organ, such as an increased growth of the muscular fibres of the ventricles, great wasting of the parietes, deposition of fat in its substance, and some others, which a person well acquainted with the natural struc- ture of this organ will have little difficulty in detecting. Pleura, This membrane, when attacked by inflam- mation, goes through the same stages as described when speaking of inflammation of the pericardium; thicken- ing of its substance, increased vascularity, terminating in tbe deposition of lymph on the surface, which has the same reticulated appearance, and in some cases going on to the formation of purulent fluid and water; where the inflammation has existed for a considerable time, an adhesion through the medium of coagulable lymph is established between the pleura costalis and pleura pulmonalis ; when recent these adhesions are slight and easily broken down; but when they have existed for any considerable length of lime, they become so strong that much force is required to destroy them; in fact.

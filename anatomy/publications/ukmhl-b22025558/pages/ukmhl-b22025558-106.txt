96 ward tlie inferior angle of the scapula; it thus assists the capsular muscles in retaining these two bones in apposition. The origin of this muscle is superficial, the latissimus dorsi sometimes overlaps it; it is here con- nected to the infra-spinatus and teres minor; from the latter the long head of the triceps afterwards separates it; it passes anterior to this muscle, and assists the latis- simus in forming the posterior fold of the axilla. The muscles of the arm are the coraco-brtvchialis, biceps, and brachiteus anticus anteriorly, and the triceps pos- teriorly. CoRAco-BRACHiALiS arises tendinous and fleshy from the point of the coracoid process, and from the tendon of the short head of the biceps ; it descends obliquely forwards, and is inserted, chiefly tendinous, into the internal side of the humerus, about the middle, and into the ridge leading to the internal condyle, by an aponeurosis, which forms the internal inter-muscular ligament, which is joined to the fascia of the arm. Use, to adduct, raise, and draw forwards the arm ; also to rotate it outwards. The origin of this muscle cannot be separated from the short head of the biceps, but as it descends, it lies behind, and to the inner side of that â€¢ muscle; it is covered above by the deltoid and pectoral; a small portion of it below is superficial, and is seen be- tween the biceps and triceps; its insertion is just below that of the teres major, and separates the brachiaeus an- ticus and posticus: the coraco-brachialis passes over the tendon of the subscapular, latissimus and teres mus- cles ; the brachial artery and median nerve, at first lie to its inner side, but pass superficial to its inseition; the belly of this muscle is generally, but not always, perforated by the External cutaneous, or perforans cas- serii nerve. Biceps, is situated along the fore part ot the humerus, t and consists of two portions superiorly, the external or long, the internal or short; the internal arises tendi- nous from the coracoid process, between the coraco- brachialis and triangular ligament; it soon becomes fleshy, descends obliquely outwards, and a little above the middle of the humerus is united to the external or

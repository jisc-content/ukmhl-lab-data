288 ganglion be raised from the bone, a small fasciculus of fibres may be observed to pass from the trunk of the fifth pair, without entering into the ganglion, to the in- ferior maxillary nerve ; this fasciculus can be traced into the anterior root of the fifth, or into the pons \ d- rolii. When this nerve is detached from the brain, a small nipple-like tubercle is seen on the latter at the point of separation. The fifth pair of nerves resemble spinal nerves, in arising by two roots, and in having a ganglion placed on the posterior, to which the anterior is only connected. The SIXTH or Abducentes, are of a middle size between the third and fourth; eacl arises from the outer side of the corpus pyramidale, a little below the pons, it passes forwards and outwards, pierces the dura mater behind the body of the sphenoid bone, traverses the cavernous sinus on the outer side of the carotid artery, and is there joined by two or three small fila- ments from the superior cervical ganglion of the sym- pathetic nerve, it then enters the orbit through the for- amen lacerum, and is distributed to the external rec- tus muscle j the basilar artery is between the sixth pair of nerves. The SEVENTH PAIR consists of two portions, the PoRTio Dura or the Facial nerve and the Portio Mollis or the Auditory nerve; the facial nerve arises Irom the lower edge of the side of the pons be- low the crus cerebelli, and rather behind and above the corpus olivare ; the auditory nerve or portio molhs arises by three or four striae from thesideof the calamus scrip- torius and from a small mass of grey substance on the back of the corpus restiforme; these are at first sepa- rated bv the restiforme, but soon unite into one soft white cord, which passes forwards and outwards and joins the portio dura ; the two nerves then pass outwards, tlie mollis being larger than the dura, which is con- tained in a groove in the former, and a small blood ves- sel runs between them ; they both enter the meatus auditorius internus, where they soon separate; cial nerve runs along the aqueduct ot Fallopius, w ici canal opens inferiorly at the stylo-mastoid foramen ; this nerve then turns forwards, and is distributed to the side

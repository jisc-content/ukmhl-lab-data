36 lower jaw; draw forward the tongue with a tenaculum, and cleanse the parts very well. The 7)iouth is bounded anteriorly by the lips, superiorly by the hard and soft palate, laterally by the cheeks, inferiorly by the tongue, and mucous membrane reflected from it to the gums ; posteriorly it communicates with the pharynx : this opening is named i\\e isthmus faucium; it is bounded above by the velum and uvula, below by the tongue, and on each side by the arches of the palate. The an- terior part of the palate, or hardpalate, is formed of the palate plates of the maxillary and palate bones, covered by mucous membrane and glands; the posterior part of the palate, or sqfi palate, or velum pendulum, consists of a dense aponeurosis, and of several muscles and glands, enclosed in mucous membrane ; the cheeks are formed of mucous membrane, covered by the buccina- tor and a quantity of fat; several small mucous glands lie between the membrane and this muscle, and towards the upper and back part on each side we perceive the small opening of Stenoâ€™s duct. The mouth is lined throughout by mucous membrane, which is continuous with the cutis on the lips, and extends posteriorly through the pharynx, whence it ascends to line the nares, the Eustachian tube and tympanum on each side, and descends to line the oesophagus and larynx; as it is reflected from one surface to another, it forms folds or freena, as between the lips and alveoli, and beneath the tongue; at the sides of the fauces, also, it forms two semilunar folds on each side, called the pillars or arches of the palate: these folds enclose muscular fibres, which we shall examine afterwards. On looking into the mouth, either in the living or dead subject, the follow- ing objects strike the attention; inferiorly the tongue and teeth; laterally the cheeks; posteriorly the back part of the pharynx; superiorly the hard and soft palate, from the centre of the latter, the uvula, and from the sides, the pillars or arches descending to the tongue and pharynx; in the recess between these pillars on each side the tonsil or amygdala is also seen ; lastly, if the tongue be drawn forward, the epiglottis comes into view. The tongue is of a triangular shape : its base, thick

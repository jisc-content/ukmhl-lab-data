292 two fissures by transverse bands or commissures ; if either side be divided by a transverse section, it will be found to consist of grey and white substance, the latter placed externally, the former internally, and of a lu- nated appearance, the concavity looking outwards ; some grey substance is also placed transversely, and connects the convexities of these lateral masses. The younger the subject the more distinct is the cineritius substance in the spinal cord. The medullary substance on each side appears to be arranged in three columns, separated by superficial grooves; from these the spinal nerves proceed, and it has been partly ascertained by Majendie and Bell that the posterior roots of these nerves are endowed with sensation only, that the ante- rior are connected with voluntary motion, and the mid- dle, or those which arise from the sides of the cord, with respiration. In addition to the spinal accessory nerves, which may be now seen to arise from each side of the medulla spinalis in the upper half of the neck by twelve or four- teen small filaments, and to ascend behind the liga- menta denticulata, the spinal cord gives origin to thirty pair of nerves. ORIGIN OF THE SPINAL NERVEk. The spinal nerves are symmetrical; there are thirty pair, which are divided into eight cervical, twelve dor- sal, five lumbar, and five sacral; all these nerves arise and terminate nearly in a similar manner; each spinal nerve is at first composed of two roots, an anterior and posterior, each of which consists of several filaments, which oTisc from the antei'ior and postei lor surface of the spinal cord on either side of the median fissures; these filaments unite into fasciculi; those composing the posterior root are larger than those in the anterior; these two fasciculi or roots are separated from each other by the side of the spinal cord, and by the liga- mentum dentatum; they then converge and proceed ob- liquely outwards and dowâ€™mvards to the dura matei, which the}' perforate distinctly by two small openings,

near the I^nee, where it is covered by the sartoriiis ; its insertion is interior to that of the sartorius, and supe- rior to that of the serai-tendinosus; the saphena vein and nerve are situated between its tendon and that of the sartorius at the inner side of the knee, but these are separated from each other by a fascia, which attaches t lese tendons together, the vein iying superficial: from the tendon of the gracilis an aponeurosis is sent off to the tascia of the leg. I ECTIN.BUS, flat, triangular,''Toroad above, situated at the superior, anterior, and internal part of the thio-h • arises fleshy from the linea innominata on the horizontal ramus of the pubis, between the spine of that bone and the ilio-pectm$al eminence ; it forms a flat fleshy belly, which descends obliquely outwards and backwards, and IS inserted by a flat tendon into the rough ridge which leads from the lesser trochanter to the linea aspera. Lse, to adduct and flex the fliigh, also, to rotale it out- wards; It may also serve to strengthen the capsular ligament of the hip joint internally, and in adduction of the hrab to draw the capsule inwards from between the neck of the femur and the acetabulum. The pectinreus lies between the psoas magnus and the adductor longus • tie latter overlaps it; it is covered superiorly by the fascia lata, and inferiorly by the femoral vessels; it covers the obturator nerve and vessels, the external obturator muscle, and the adductor brevis ; it also ad- heres to the capsular ligament of the hip joint. iRiCEPs Adductor Femoris consists of three nor- thTthi'gh ^ distinct laminae from the pelvis to Adductor Longus, flat and triangular, broad below IS situated at t^ upper and internal part of the thigh’ . uperficial to the other adductors and to the pectinmus’ n nmw by a short, small, but strong tendon from the a tenor surface of the pubis, between its spine and the symphysis; tins ends in a broad fleshy belly, which de- •scend, obliquely backwards and outwards, and is in- serted by a broad thin tendon into the middle third of the linea aspera, between the adductor magnus and the astus internus, to both of which it is closely united fhe origin of t.iis muscle lies between the pcctimeus

58 SECTION II. DISSECTION OF THE AXILLA. The Axilla is a conical cavity, the apex superiorly at the coracoid process and clavicle, the base below, formed by skin and a thick fascia ; it is bounded anteri- orly by the great and lesser pectoral muscles, internal- ly by the serratus magnus and the ribs, externally by the scapula and subscapular muscle, and posteriorly by the serratus and latissimus dorsi. This region con- tains several lymphatic glands, vessels and nerves, and a quantity of loose cellular and adipose tissue, which is continued from the neck beneath the clavicle, and often presents a watery reddish appearance. When the pectoral muscles have been divided, and some cel- lular membrane removed, the axillary vein first ap- pears ; at the upper part of the axilla this vessel is in- ternal and anterior to the artery ; inferiorly it is directly over this vessel and more closely connected to it than above; this vein receives the cephalic vein, and several branches from the parietes of the thorax, and from the shoulder. The axillary artery may be next seen, tak- ing an oblique course downwards and outwards through this space, and giving oftâ€™ thoracic branches from its in- ternal side; and from its external, the subscapular and circumflex arteries; behind the artery, at the upper part of the axilla, the brachial ^plexus of nerves is seen ; as this descends it becomes more and more closely con- nected to it, and at the lower part of this cavity the branches of the plexus have almost surrounded the ar- tery. This plexus may be seen dividing into several branches; superiorly, it gives oft the thoracic, supia and subscapular ; and lower dowai it divides into the external and internal cutaneous, the median, ulnar, ra- dial or spiral, and articular or circumflex. The gene- ral distribution of these branches will bo noticed in the dissection of the upper e.xtremity, and tor their parti- cular description see Anatomy ot the Nervous System. At the lower part of the axilla the artery may be ob- served in general to lie between the two roots ot the

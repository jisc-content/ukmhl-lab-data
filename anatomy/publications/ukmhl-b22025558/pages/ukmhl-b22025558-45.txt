pair of cervical nerves ; the 1st, or suboccipital, is veiy small; the 8th is very large; the 1st leaves the spinal canal between the occipital bone and the atlas; and the 8th between the last cervical and first dorsal vertebra: these cervical nerves all divide into a posterior and an- terior branch, the former are distributed to the muscles and integuments on the back of the neck; the anterior branches of the 1st, 2d, 3d, and 4th, communicate with each other, and give origin to several branches, which again unite with each other,, and constitute the cervical plexus ; this plexus is between the mastoid and trape- zius muscles ; it sends oftâ€™ several branches, which are entangled with much cellular membrane and several absorbent glands : the anterior branches of the four inferior cervical nerves with that of the first dorsal, unite and form the brachial plexus ; this is situated at the lateral and inferior part of the neck, and accompa- nies the subclavian artery beneath the clavicle into the axilla, in which region the plexus divides into several branches to supply the upper extremity and the mus- cles on the parietes of the thorax. In the inferior and lateral part of the neck, on each side, {hephrenic nerve is also seen; this arises by several fine filaments from the 3d, 4th, and 5th cervical nerves ; the phrenic nerve descends obliquely inwards along the anterior scalenus muscle, enters the thorax between the subclavian vein and artery, and is distributed to the diaphragm. Pre- vious to examining the deep muscles of the neck, the student should study the anatomy of the mouth, pharynx, and larynx. SECTION II. DISSECTIOK OF THE MOUTH, PHARYNX, AND LARYNX. The cavity of the mouth may be exposed by divid- ing the commissure of the lips and the cheek of one side, and removing a small portion of the side of the

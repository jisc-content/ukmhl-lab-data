374 tcstine; near the latter each branch divides into two, which proceed in a direct course, one on the anterior, the other on the posterior surface of the intestine, and are distributed principally to the mucous mem- brane. The inferior mesenteric ctr/ery arises about two inches below the preceding ; it descends towards the left iliac fossa and divides into three branches, left colic, sig- moid, and superior haemorrhoidal ; the lejt colic as- cends in the left meso-colon, anastomoses with the mid- dle colic branch of the superior mesenteric, and sup- plies the left part of the colon ; the sigmoid artery is distributed to the sigmoid flexure of the colon ; the jm- â€œperior hcemorrhoidal descends along the back pait ot the rectum, supplies the coats ot this intestine, and inos- culates with the middle and inferior haemorrhoidal ar- teries. The renal arteries arise from the sides of the aorta, between the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries; the right is longer than the left; it passes across the spine behind the vena cava; both pass behind their corresponding vein and divide near the kidney into five or six branches, which ramify through the substance of this gland. The capsular arteries are two or three in number; they arise either from the renal arteries or from the aorta; they supply the renal capsules. The spermatic arteries arise from the fore-pai t of the aorta ; the left frequently arises from the lenal ar- tery ; they are long and tortuous, descend obliquely outwards, crossing in front of the psoas muscle and the ureter; in the male they accompany the vas deferens through the inguinal canal, and supply the testicle and epididymis; in the female they pass to the ova- rium, and also send branches to the fallopian tubes, and to the sides of the uterus. The lumbar arteries are four or five pair; they arise from the back part of the aorta, pass obliquely out- wards through tire psoas, send branches between the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebiac, to the muscles of the back and loins, and terminate in the ab- dominal muscles.

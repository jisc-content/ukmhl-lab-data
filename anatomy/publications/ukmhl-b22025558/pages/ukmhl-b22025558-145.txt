135 time, tlie spermatic canal will be fouritl altered in many respects from its natural condition ; it will have become dilated and shortened, and the abdominal rinas expand- ed and approximated so as to render it difficult to dis- tinpish tne oblique from the direct inguinal hernia. In connexion with inguinal hernia, the student may next study the anatomy of the groin in reference to cru- ral hernia or he may postpone this dissection until the contents of the abdomen have been examined and re- moved ; we shall however here subjoin the description of the parts concerned in this disease: remove the inteeu- ments from the anterior part of the upper third of the thigh, t.ie superficial fascia will be seen descendimr over l^oupart s igament to invest the lower extremity • In the groin this fascia IS very thick, and may be divided into amf[l.P by lymphatic glands and the supeihcial inguinal vessels; this fascia may be easily raised from rhe fascia lata on the outer and ihner sides of the .high but in the middle of the groin and about an men below Poupart’s ligament, these fasciie are almost inseparably joined; when the superficial fascia WP feted off the forepart of the thigh, ne shall see severa lymphatic glands, the saphena vein and some small blood-vessels lying on the fascia • in structure the latter more resembles the superficial, than the fascia lata ; the form and boundaries of the inguinal region also may then be more distinctly seen ; this'^space 1. tnangu ar, the base is Poupart’s ligament; the Ipex addimt'"’' meeting of the Sartorius and adductor museffis; the external side is very prominent I clTIf ^he sartorius, ihacus, rectus^nd other muscles all covered by the fascia lata; the internal or pubic side IS flat and on a plane posterior to the iliac • It IS formed by the pectinaeus and adductor muscles also covered by the fascia lata. The inguinal are irregu ar in number and size; they are in ceneral about twelve m number, and may be thvided into a sn perfica and a deep set; the arc tl.e mo e nun,« iTeHof St at.roSr,;eltT'l^l?nSrsi;ri"5:r;“

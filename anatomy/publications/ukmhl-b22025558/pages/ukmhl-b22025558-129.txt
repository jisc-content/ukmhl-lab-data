119 ficial, and lies between the tendon of the flexor sub- liiuis and flexor carpi ulnaris; it is attended by its two veins, and in the inferior two-thirds of the fore- arm by the ulnar nerve, which always lies to its ulnar side ; near the wrist this nerve is somewhat behind the artery. The ulnar artery sends off 1st and 2d its re- current branches, the anterior, small, ascends in front of the internal condyle, the posterior, large, passes behind that condyle and Joins the inferior profunda; 3d, the interosseous artery, which passing backwards, divides into its posterior and anterior branch ; the pos- terior passes through the upper part of the interos- seous space, and ascends in the substance of the an- conaeus; the anterior interosseous descends between and beneath the flexor profundus and flexor pollicis as far as the pronator quadratus, where it terminates; 4-th, muscular branches ; 5th and 6th, to the back and front of the carpus; and in the palm of the hand it terminates in the deep and superficial branch ; the former sinks between the muscles of the little finger, to join the deep palmar arch ; the superficial runs across the flexor tendons, forming the superficial arch, from the convex side of which, the long digital arte- ries arise; these supply the three inner fingers. (See Vascular System.) In addition to the cutaneous nerves already noticed, we find the median, ulnar and musculo-spiral descend- ing in the forearm ; the median nerve passes between the heads of the pronator teres, and descends beneath the flexor sublimis, giving off the anterior interosseous nerve, and branches to the muscles of the forearm; it passes beneath the annular ligament, appears superficial in the palm of the hand near the thumb, and sends off digital branches, which accompany the digital arteries to all the fingers, except the little and the ulnar side of the ring finger. The idnar nerve winds round be- hind the internal condyle, between the heads of the flexor carpi ulnaris, and descends along the internal side of the ulnar artery to the hand, where it termi- nates, by dividing into a small superficial and a lar<re deep branch, dhe musculo-spiral or radial nerve^h seen beneath the supinator longus, descending alon<>-

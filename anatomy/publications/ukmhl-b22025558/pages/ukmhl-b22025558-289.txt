279 nia, its edge is serrated; this is tlie corpus denticidatuuu Divide the fornix about its centre, draw forwards its anterior portion, and the foramen commune anterius will be seen ; throw the posterior portion backwards, and the choroid membrane or the velum interpositum will be exposed ; this is of a triangular form, beneath the fornix, and above the optic thalami, the pineal gland, the arachnoid canal, and the third ventricle ; the cho- roid plexuses are united to it laterally and in front, the vence Galeni extend along its median line ; these veins receive the blood from each plexus, and from the different eminences in the ventricles, they pass back- wards, and end in the straight sinus, they sometimes first unite into one trunk; the velum is formed of pia mater, which is continued from the surface of the brain through the great transverse fissure, which is beneath the corpus callosum and the fornix, and above the tu- bercula quadrigemina and the pineal gland; it is also covered by the arachnoid membrane, which is of ex- treme delicacy ; raise this membrane from before back- wards, first dividing the small veins which run into it, the optic thalami will be now exposed, and posterior to these the pineal gland, and the superior surface of the tubercula quadrigemina; the anterior extremity of the arachnoid canal also is seen ; this orifice is beneath the veins of Galen and above the gland, it is in general surrounded b}â€™small granulations; remove the velum. The pineal gland is situated above the tubercula quadri- gemina, about the size of a pea, cineritious, heart-shaped, the base anteriorly containing, in general, some small sandy particles (the acervulus,) the posterior part is soft and pulpy, ihe(conarium) is surrounded by a very vascular membrane derived from the velum ; unconnected to the brain in every situation, except anteriorly, whence a small transverse medullary band proceeds, which di- vides into too long delicate processes {peduncidi,) these pass forwards on the inner surface of the optic thalami, and join the descending pillars of the fornix, at the for- amen commune anterius. The optic thalami, two firm bodies white on their surface, grey within, placed behind and between the corpora striata, smooth superiorly

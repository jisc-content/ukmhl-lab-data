162 right and left portion, and is contiguous with the diaphragm. The inferior surface is very irregular, marked by several projections and depressions; the former are called lobes, and are five in number, viz. first, the great or right lobe ; second, the /c/i, separated from the former by the horizontal fissure; third, ihe spige- lian or middle lobe; this is situated behind the lesser omentum and above and behind the transverse fissure, and between the oesophagus and the cava; it is con- nected to the right lobe by two roots; one is thin and placed vertically between the fissure for the vena cava and that for the ductus venosus ; the other is thick and placed transversely, and is called lobidus caudatus, or the fourth lobe of the liver; the lobulus caudatus is immediately behind the transverse fissure, and extends from the spigelian, along the right lobe between the depressions marked by the colon and right kidney. Fifth, the lobulus quadratus or anonymus, is at the ante- rior part of the right lobe, in front of the transverse fis- sure, and between the gall bladder and horizontal fis- sure. The principal depressions or fissures on the in- ferior surface of the liver are the following ; first, the transverse Jissure which is situated between the lobulus quadratus and caudatus, and extends from the horizon- tal fissure transversely to the right; the vessels and nerves of the liver enter the gland in this fissure; se- cond, the horizontal Jissure extends from the notch in the anterior edge of the liver, backwards and upwards between the right and left lobes; the anterior pait of this fissure contains the obliterated umbilical vein, the posterior part the obliterated ductus venosus; third, the Jissure for the vena cava is between the lobulus spi- gelii and the right lobe ; this, as the anterior part of the horizontal fissure, is frequently like a foramen in the liver, being surrounded by the substance of the gland : fifth, the depression for the gall bladder is on the inferior surface of the right lobe, and to the rig it side of the lobulus quadratus; the substance of the liver is sometimes deficient over this bag; sixth ant seventh, superficial depressions on the under sur ace o the right lobe; the anterior corresponds to the co/ow, the posterior to the right kidney and its capsule; t lese

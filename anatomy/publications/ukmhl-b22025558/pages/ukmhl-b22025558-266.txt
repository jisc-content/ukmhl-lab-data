256 the second layer are the long flexor tendons, the acces- sory muscle and the lumbricales; the third layer con- sists of the flexor pollicis brevis, adductor pollicis, trans- versalis pedis, and flexor minimi digiti; in the fourth layer, are the interossei muscles, and the tendon of the peronaeus longus. , n i Abductor Pollicis, arises tendinous and flesny from the lower and inner part of the os calcis, trom the internal annular ligament, the plantar aponeurosis, and internal inter-muscular septum; the flbres pass foi wards and inwards, and are inserted tendinous into the inter- nal sesamoid bone, and into the internal side ot the base of the first phalanx ot the great toe. use, to se- parate the great toe Ironi the others ; this muscle is by some writers called the adductor pollicis, its action being then referred to the mesial line of the body; it is the most internal of the plantar muscles and is superfi- cial, the fascia covering it is very thin. Flexor Digitorum Brevis Perforatus arises from the inferior and rather from the internal part of the os calcis, from the internal annular ligament, the plantar aponeurosis and inter-muscular septa; it forms a fleshy mass, which passing forwards divides about the middle of the foot into four delicate tendons, which ac- company the flexor longus communis into the and synovial sheaths, bemeath the phalanges of the four outer toes; each tendon is slit opposite the base of the second phalanx, and having tendon, this short tendon is then folded out on the n ferior surface of the second phalanx, and is inserted into it, above the long flexor tendon. Use, to assist the lono- flexor, to strengthen the plantar fascia, and to meseiAe the arch of the foot; this muscle is imme- diately above the strong central poriion of the plantai fasciaf from which a considerable portion ot it arises, it therefore always presents a rough surface, when dis- sS it bequeath the long flexor tendons, the ac- cessory muscle and the lumbricales ; it is joined to the a?du for pollicis posteriorly, but anteriorly - -1- from it by the tenVlon of the flexor fourth or the external of its tendons, oi that tor tiie little toe, is sometimes wanting.

25 mastoid, which can thus move more easily on this structure. The anterior belly and insertion are co- vered by the integuments and fascia, and this portion of the muscle divides the anterior lateral triangle of the neck into an inferior and superior part. The omo- hyoid crosses over the scaleni muscles, the brachial plexus, phrenic, pneumo-gastric and sympathetic nerves, the carotid artery, and jugular vein. Beneath the three last described muscles, and lying on the trachea and sides of the larynx, is a large, soft, red mass of a crescentic shape, the concavity directed upwards ; this is the thyroid gland; it is in general larger in the child than in the adult or old, and in the female than in the male; its size, however, varies con- siderably in different individuals even of the same sex and age. It consists of two large pyramidal portions, called lateral lobes, connected together by a narrow slip, the middle lobe ; this is thin and flat, and closely connected to the second, third, and fourth rings of the trachea ; the lateral lobes are plump and convex, large below, pointed above, placed by the side of the trachea and larynx, and extending as high as the ala of the thy- roid cartilage; the left lateral lobe rests on the oeso- phagus, and both right and left overlap the carotid artery, inferior thyroid vessels, and recurrent nerve; they are-covered by the sterno-mastoid, hyoid, thyroid, and omo-hyoid muscles, by the platysma and skin; they lie on the side of the trachea and larynx, on the crico-thyroid and inferior constrictor of the pharynx. This organ is soft and spongy, the cells contain a yel- low, serous, sometimes an oily fluid ; it has no excre- tory duct, although it is supplied by four large arteries; several veins, however, issue from it, particularly from its inferior part. The middle lobe is sometimes defi- cient; in some cases it passes behind the oesophagus, or between this tube and the trachea, a circumstance which might be productive of great inconvenience, and even danger, in the event of bronchocele (chronic en- largement of this gland) occurring in one in whom this malformation existed. A narrow slip is often seen to ascend from the middle lobe as high as the os hyoidcs. In the infant the low er part of the thyroid is connected u

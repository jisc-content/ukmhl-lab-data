141 pose that the hernial sac itself is exposed. These then are the coverings of the sac, which is thus placed ex- ternal or superficial to the fascia lata : the neck of the sac, however, it is to be recollected, lies deep within the sheath of the vessels, and is therefore covered by the fascia transversalis, and by the superior cornu of the falciform process of the fascia lata. Let the student now review the dissection that has been made ; let him move the thigh in ditferent directions, and he will re- mark that, when it is rotated inwards, Poupart’s and Gimbernaut’s ligaments, as well as the fascia lata, feel relaxed, and that the crural ring will feel larger or more dilatable ; let him also observe the relation of the femo- ral vein, the epigastric vessels, and the spermatic cord or round ligament to this opening ; pass up the finger from the groin into the crural ring, and suppose that the stricture on femoral hernia was. seated here, and that this opening required to be dilated, he will now perceive that this may be done with most safety by di- recting the edge of the bistoury forwards and a little inwards, so as to divide the external edge of Gimber- nauts ligament, which edge is composed of the inser- tion of the superior cornu of the falciform process of the fascia lata; the stricture on femoral hernia may, however, be seated lower down than in the neck of the sac ; it may be situated in that opening of the cribriform fascia through which the hernial sac has protruded; in such a case, the stricture may be divided by directing the edge of the knife directly inwards along the surface of the Pectinaeus muscle. SECTION II. DISSECTION OF THE VISCERA OF THE ABDOMEN. The abdomen is the largest cavity in the body; it is of an oval form; its capacity, and in some degree its figure, differ at different ages and in different sub- jects ; it is bounded superiorly by the diaphragm, an-

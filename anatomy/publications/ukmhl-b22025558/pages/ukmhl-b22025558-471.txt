461 neck; the bodi/ then becomes triangular, is twisted a little and curved outwards, its inner surface looks a lit- tle backwards above but is twisted forwards below; this IS divided into two portions by the internal edge into which the interosseous ligament is inserted, the anterior portion gives attachment to the extensors, and the posterior is grooved for the tibialis posticus, its ex- ternal surface is covered by the perontei muscles, the posterior surface gives attachment to the solaeus above and to the flexor pollicis below; in this surface we perceive the orifice of the vascular canal leading downwards ; the internal edge gives attachment to mus- cles above and to the interosseous ligament below, the external edge is turned backwards and gives attach- ment to the soliELis, flexor pollicis, and peronmi mus- cles ; and the anterior edge to the extensor digitorum and to the peronaei; inferiorly this edge turns outwards and bifurcates, enclosing a triangular surface, which is subcutaneous ; the lower or tarsal end is larger than the head, it is elongated into a long oval process, the external malleolus or ankle, this is larger, more promi oent and posterior to the inner ankle, it is convex and subcutaneous externally, internally it is smooth and triangular, a little concave from behind forwards and convex in the perpendicular direction, it articulates with the astragalus, above this is a triangular rough surface to articulate with the tibia, anteriorly this pro- cess 13 rough but thin for the origin of ligaments, its posterior edge is broader aud grooved for the peronaeal tendons, internal to which is a depression for the origin of the posterior lateral, or the transverse ligament of the ankle joint; from the point of this process the ex- ternal lateral ligament arises ; the fibula is articulated at both ends to the tibia and below to the astragalus. Ibe i-oof IS divided into the tarsus, metatarsus and toes. The bones of the tarsus are 7, astragalus] calcaneum, navicular, cuboid, and 3 cuneiform. _ Ihe Astragalus is next to the calcaneum in point of size It IS of an irregular twisted shape, larger above and at . Â®or posteriorly; it is situated at the upper and middle part of the tarsus, where it is wedged between the two malleoli, its superior surface R It 2

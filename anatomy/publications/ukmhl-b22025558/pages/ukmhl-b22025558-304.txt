294 stances have been stated ; it is necessary to recollect that the former is soft, vascular, and pulpy, and that the latter is fibrous ; it is an opinion entertained by many, particularly Gall and Spurzheim, that the grey is the origin or matrix of the white substance, or that the former is a secreting organ, and that the latter con- sists of fine conducting vessels or filaments; the direc- tion of the fibres in some situations is very distinct; some pass from below upwards and outwards ; these are termed the diverging fibres, others pass from the surface or circumference downwards and inwards, these 2ixe i\\e converging or uniting fibres: first proceed to trace these two orders of fibres in the cerebellum. STRUCTURE OF THE CEREBELLUM. Trace the restiform body upwards into the crus cerebelli; divide this substance vertically, and the for- mer may be seen continued into the mass of grey sub- stance in the crus known by the name of corpus den- tatum, or the ganglion of the cerebellum ; trom the inner edge of this a narrow white fasciculus may be traced inwards towards the median line; it there unites with a similar process from the opposite side, and both divide into several fine bands, which diverge and form the vermiform process, (or the primary portion of the cerebellum;) the peripheral extremities of these fibres are covered by cineritous substance, and present, when cut vertically, an arborescent appearance ; the remain- der, or the principal portion of the restiform body, passes upwards and outwards through the corpus denta- tum and then divides into several processes or stalks which diverge through each hemisphere and subdivide into finer branches, each of which is covered by the <rrey substance on the surface; a vertical section ot either hemisphere presents also that arborescent ap- pearance known by the name of arbor vit$. The con- verging fibres of the cerebellum are inferior and supe- rior ; the latter are very delicate and rather indisUnct in their course ; they consist of several fibres which issue from the vermiform process and unite in one

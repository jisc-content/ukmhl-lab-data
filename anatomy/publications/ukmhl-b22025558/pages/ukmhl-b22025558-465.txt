455 tinguiihed by a transverse ridge or crest near the root ot the great wing of the sphenoid bone, from this it ex- tends to the tuberosity of the maxillary bone, and is bounded externally by the ramus of the lower jaw. The Pterygo-Maxillary Fossa is a very narrow space, it is enclosed between the pterygoid processes behind and the tuberosity of the maxillary bone before, it is bounded>internally by the nasal lamella of the palate bone, which separates it fi'om the nose; it is imme- diately below ai:id behind the orbit, with which it com- municates by the spheno maxillary fissure, it also commu- nicates with the palate by tlie posterior palatine canals, and with the nose by the spheno palatine hole, it also leads into the temporal and zygomatic fossae. The Extremities are two superior, and two inferior. The inferior extremity is divided into three parts, the thigh, leg, and foot; the thigh contains but one bone, the femur. _ The Femur is the longest bone in the system, it con- sists of the body or shaft and two extremities ; the body IS slightly twisted, thick above, very broad below, con- tracted and nearly cylindrical in the centre, arched and smooth before and concave behind, with a sharp roucÂ»h ridge down the centre, named the linea aspera, this ex- tends along the middle third of the bone, parallel to its axis and divides above and below into two ridges, these pass superiorly one to each trochanter, that to the inner being the shorter; and inferiorly one to either condyle; these inferior divisions separate further and enclose a a flat triangular space, the popliteal; this line is very prominent about the centre and presents two lips and an interstice, for the attachment of different muscles; the anterior convex surface of the femur is broader to- \\aids either end than in the centre, it is a little con- cave superiorly, the sides are slightly flattened, and the external is somewhat broader than the internal, particu- larly above ; above the middle of the linea aspera one or two holes may be seen to enter obliquely upwards, these transmit the nutritious or the medullary vessels of the bone; to the linea aspera in the middle of the thigh, the vastus externus, the adductor tendons, and t le vastus internus are attached, to the superior exter-

26 to the thymus gland. The use of this organ is not fully ascertained. Next dissect the muscles at the upper part of the neck. Digastricus, placed at the lateral and anterior part of the neck, thick and fleshy at each extremity, round and tendinous in the centre, arises from a groove in the temporal bone, internal to the mastoid process, descends obliquely forwards and inwards, ends in a round ten- don which perforates the stylo-hyoid muscle, and is connected to the cornu of the os hyoides by a dense fascia, sometimes by a tendinous ring like a pully; the tendon is then reflected upwards and forwards, and soon ends in the anterior fleshy belly, which continu- ing forwards and inwards, is inserted into a rough de- pression on the inner side of the base of the jaw, close to the symphysis. Use, to depress the lower jaw, and when tlie mouth is closed, to elevate the os hyoides,. tongue and larynx ; the posterior belly can also draw these backwards and upwards, and the anterior up- wards and forwards, so that this muscle can exert great influence in deglutition ; it can also draw the head backwards, if the chin be fixed. The digastric is covered posteriorly by the sterno-mastoid and splenius, and by a portion of the parotid, more anteriorly by a few fibres of the stylo-hyoideus and a small part of the submaxillary gland, by the cervical fascia, platysma and skin ; it passes across the styloid muscles, the external and internal carotid arteries, the 8th, 9th and sympa- thetic nerves; also the origin of the hyo-glossus and insertion of the mjdo-hyoid. In the position in which the subject is placed during this dissection, this muscle forms the inferior or convex border of a semicircular space, the superior straight edge of which is marked by the side of the maxilla, and by a line continued from its angle to the mastoid process: this digastric space is divided by the stylo-maxillary ligament into a posterior and anterior part. The posterior smaller one contains the parotid gland, the carotid artery, and 7th pair of nerves ; and deeper than these, the styloid pro- cess and origin of the styloid muscles, also the int-caro- tid, jugular vein, and 8th, 9th and sympathetic nerves. The anterior division of the digastric space contains

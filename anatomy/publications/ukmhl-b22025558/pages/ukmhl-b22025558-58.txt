48 Thyro-arytenoideus is flat and thin, arises from the posterior surface of the thyroid cartilage near its angle : the fibres pass backwards and outwards, expand- ing over the side of the rima glottidis, and are inserted into the anterior edge of the arytenoid cartilage. Use, to draw the cartilage forwards and towards its fellow, thereby diminishing the capacity of the rima elottidis; these muscles can also produce various alterations in the form, position, and degree of tension of the chordae vo- cales, which they cover, and they can compress the sinus, or sacculus laryngis. The thyro-arytonoid mus- cles are considered by some as the principal and most important agents in the production of voice, in conse- quence of their proximity to the vocal chords, and their capability of producing endless varieties in their condi- tion, causing the vibration in their edges so to differ in intensity and duration, as to produce, from the air pass- ing over them, (to a certain extent only) correspond- ing varieties of sound or tone. These muscles are covered by the alse of the thyroid cartilage; they lie on the chordae vocales, and the in- termediate sinus ; superiorly, their fibres extend to an indefinite height in the mucous folds of the glot- tis, and inferiorly they are connected to the following muscles. Crico-arytenoideus lateralis, arises from the upper edge of the side of the cricoid cartilage; as- cends obliquely backwards, inserted into the base of the arytenoid. Use, to draw that cartilage forwards and outwards, and thus to relax the vocal chords, and enlarge the rima from side to side, but contract it from before backwards. Raise the mucous membrane on the back part of the larynx, to expose the muscles situated there. Crico-arytenoideus Posticus, strong and flat, arises from the depression on the posterior surface of the cricoid ; the fibres ascend obliquely outwards, in- serted by a tendon into the outside of the base of the arytenoid cartilage. Use, to draw this cartilage back- wards and outwards, so as to enlarge the rima in every direction, as in full inspiration. These muscles lie on the back of the cricoid cartilage, and are covered pos-

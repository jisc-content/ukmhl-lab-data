DISSECTION OF THE BRAIN. HE biain is subdivided into three portions, cere- brum, cerebellum, and medulla oblongata ; these are however, so intimately connected, that it is difficult to mark the exact lirnits of each. Divide the scalp from one ear across the vertex to the other; reflect one flap over the face, the other over the back of the neck ; make a circular cut with the saw through the cranium on a level with the cartilage of the ear on each side, anteriorly about an inch jfbove the superciliary arches, and posteriorly a little below the tubercle of the os occipitis. It is only necessary to saw through the outer table of the bones, the eleva- tor, or a few smari strokes with the claw of the ham- mer will then suffice to crack the internal table, (indeed the cranium may be opened by the hammer alone â€¢ tliia plan, however, injures the bones so much as to

400 whicli it forms a cul de sac, is prolonged into the sig- moid cavities of the ulna, and thence is reflected to the lateral ligaments and to the triceps tendon, which leads it to the posterior depression on the humerus, it is thence expanded over the articular eminences at the lower end of this bone. RADIO-ULNAH ARTICULATIONS. These are two, a superior and an inferior ; in the stiperior the head of the radius is received into the lesser sigmoid cavity of the ulna, and is retained in it by the following ligament. The annular ligament forms about three-fourths of a circle ; it arises from ihe anterior, and is inserted into the posterior border of the lesser sigmoid cavity of the ulna; this liga- ment is lined by the synovial membrane of the joint, it encircles the head and neck of the radius; it often presents a cartilaginous structure. The oblique ligament is a small round fibrous cord, it arises from the coronoid process of the ulna, de- scends obliquely outwards, and is inserted into the radius below its tubercle ; it is on a plane anterior to the inter-osseous ligament, and it separates the flexor digitorum sublimis from the supinator radii brevis mus- cle. The opposed edges of the radius and ulna are con- nected by a thin aponeurosis the inter-osseal membrane or ligament; it is composed of long fibres which de- scend obliquely inw-ards from the radius to the ulna; this ligament is deficient above and below, and in many places is perforated by vessels. ... In the inferior radio-ulnar articulation^ the round head of the ulna is received into the sigmoid cavity of the radius, and retained in it by a \oose synovial ' membrane or the sacciform ligament, which is cover- ed before and behind by some ligamentous fibres ; it passes from the radius to the uina, and forms a very loose sac above the following ligament or cartilage; it alwat's contains a quantity ot synovia. The fibro-cartUage is triangular, it arises narrow from the styloid process of the ulna, and rs inserted

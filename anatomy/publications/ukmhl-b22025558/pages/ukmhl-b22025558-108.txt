98 the great pectoral and deltoid: not unfrequently thi* muscle has another origin from the humerus below its head; in some a fasciculus unites it to the coraco-bra- chialis, and in others to the brachiaeus anticus muscle, which lies behind it. The belly of the biceps is super- ficial, and lies on the brachialis anticus; the brachial artery descends along its internal border, and somewhat overlapped by it, in the middle and lower part of the arm. This muscle or its tendon will serve as a guide in the living subject, in case we are required to tie this vessel, but superiorly the coraco-brachialis intervenes : the semilunar fascia is extended over the trunk of this artery and nerve, and affords them some, but not a con- stant protection, in the operation of venesection in the median basilic vein, which vein is superficial to this fascia, but parallel, and often so close to the artery as to expose the latter to some degree of danger in that operation. BaACHiALis Anticus, or Externus, improperly called by some Internus, arises from the centre of the humerus by two fleshy slips, one on either side of the insertion of the deltoid, from the forepart of the bone down to the condyles, and on each side as far as the intermuscular ligaments; the fibres descend con- verging, pass anterior to the elbow joint, adhere to the synovial membrane, and are inserted by a strong tendon into the coronoid process of the ulna, and into a rough surface on this bone beneath that process. Use, to flex the forearm, and in doing so it draws the synovial mem- brane out of the angle of the joint; it also strengthens this articulation in its extended state, by pressing the ulna against the humerus, and supporting the joint in front: this muscle is covered by the biceps and by the brachial vessels and nerves ; external to the biceps it is superficial; its external head is the longer, and lies be- tween tbe deltoid and second head of ihe triceps; the internal separates the deltoid from the coraco-brachialis; the tendon .passes deep into the hollow at the elbow, behind the tendon of the biceps, and is inserted on its internal side; a fleshy fasciculus often unites this musclti and the biceps about the middle of the arm.

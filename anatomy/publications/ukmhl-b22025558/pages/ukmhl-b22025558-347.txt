337 membrane ; to the anterior part of the bones of the nose, the cartilages, which form the septum and aim nasi, are attached. The nose is bounded superiorly by the nasal, frontal, ethmoid and sphenoid bones, the roof of the nose is arched, and has different aspects, the anterior part looks downwards and backwards, the middle perpen- dicularly downwards, and the posterior part downwards and forwards ; interiorly by the palatine plates of the maxillary and palate bones, the floor of the nose is nearly horizontal, but with a slight inclination back- wards, and is concave in the transverse direction, on either fci e by the superior maxillary, unguis, spongy, ethmoid and palate bones, and by the internal pterygoid plates; It IS divided into two symmetrical portions (the nares) by the septum, which is composed of the azj^gos plate of the sphenoid, the nasal lamella of the ethmoid, the vomer, the spines of the palate and maxillary bones, and by a cartilage ; the external wall of each naris is deeply grooved by three fossae or meatuses, the superior, middle, and inferior; they are situated between the spongy bones, the middle is the widest ; the nasal or lachrymal duct opens into the anterior third of the inferior meatus, the Eustachian tube behind, but on a level with the inferior spongy bone, and at the side o the septum anteriorly may be observed the su- perior orifice of the anterior palatine canal, which, al- tnough a distinct opening superiorly towards the cavity of the nose, yet inferiorly towards the mouth, forms with the one of the opposite side a common foramen • this communication, however, between the nose and mouth does not exist in the recent state in the human subject but does so in some animals, and in these Ja- cobson has ascribed a peculiar office to it; into the middle meatus, the antrum maxillare opens by a small oblique slit, which looks backwards and inwards, and although in the dry bone appears tolerably large, yet in the recent state admits only a small probe, on account ot the mucous membrane being thrown into a small fold which surrounds it, and in front of this, a groove named the infundibulum, which leads from the frontal sinus ; into this groove the anterior ethmoid cells open • into the upper meatus, the posterior ethmoid cells c; G

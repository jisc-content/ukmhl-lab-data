310 in a plexifonn manner ; this plexus is named parotidean plexus, or pes anserinns. The temporo-facial nerve as- cends obliquely forwards across the neck of the lower jaw ; it first communicates with the auricular branch of the inferior maxillary nerve, and then divides into three fasciculi, the temporal, malar, and buccal; these nerves take that course which their name implies; they are all remarkable for the plexiform arrangement of their branches, and for their frequent communications with each other, and with the three divisions of the fifth pair, which are distributed to the face. The cervico-Jhcial nerve descends obliquely forwards through the parotid gland towards the angle of the jaw, where it is only co- vered by the skin and platysma ; this nerve also divides into many branches, which may be arranged in three fasciculi, the maxillary, the sub-maxillary, and the cer- vical; the first, or the niaxillarp, cvois the ramus of the jaw and the masseter muscle, and communicate in the mus- cles of the lower lip with the mental nerve, and with the superior division of the seventh; the second, or suh-maxil- lary, course along the base of the jaw, sending filaments to the integuments and superficial muscles, these also communicate at the chin with the mental nerve; the third, or cervical branches, are ver}' long and numer- ous ; they are distributed to the platysma and to the superficial muscles of the neck, and communicate with several filaments of the cervical plexus. The portio dura nerve has been ingeniously supposed by Mr. Bell to be the nerve that excites the muscles of the face in particular conditions of respiration and in the expies- sion of passion, &c., hence he has named it the respira- tory nerve of the face; others consider the poitio dura as the exclusive motor nerve of the face. The AuniTORY Nerve or Portio Mollis of the se- venth pair; this nerve separates from the portio dura at the bottom of the meatus auditorius internus, and then divides into tw'o branches, an anterior and pos- terior ; the anterior passes forwards to the cochlea, penetrates through many small openings, and is dis- tributed to the membrane covering its spiral lamina, and to that lining the canal on its axis: the posterior branch passes outwards, forms a gi'^y swelling, lom

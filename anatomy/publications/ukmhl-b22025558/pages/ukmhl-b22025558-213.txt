QOS w ith P‘^ch other, and wuh the vessels and nerves of the gland : this structure receives the name of Testis, which 13 therefore placed near the posterior part of the g and, and enclosed between the laminae of the corpus highmonanum; from the upper part of this tissue five or SIX tortuous vessels ascend obliquely backwards, pierce the tunica albuginea, and arrive at the head of the epididymis; here they increase in size, and become coi et or convoluted ; these are the vasa ^ereniia or com vasciilosi: they all terminate in the head or globus major ot the epididymis, and unite into one small duct (the vas deferens), which is twisted and coiled over and over again m a most extraordinary and peculiar man- nei. Ihe body and globus minor of the epididymis are solely composed of this convoluted vessel, which by care may be unravelled to a great extent: the con, volutions ot this tube, of which the epididymis thus consists, are connected to each other by fine cellular tissue and by the reflected tunica vaginalis; the epidi- dymis has no fibrous capsule like the testis; from its ower extremity the vas deferens at length escapes, and mcreasing in size and density, this duct bends upwards a ong the inner side of the epididymis, and a little above the head of the latter it becomes connected to the spermatic vessels and cremaster muscle ; with these upwards and outwards along the inguinal channel, and through the internal bdominal ring: it here separates from the spermatic essels, the latter ascending towards the spine, while he va, deferens passes backwards, inwards, and down- wards, enc osed in the lateral fold of peritoneum which conducts It to the bladder, along the side and inferior fundus of which it runs internal to the ve- co'iverging to its fellow : at the ififl I ‘ gland each vas deferens joins of union c,e forms the ductus ejaculatorius communis obliquely forwards and inwards, and opens into the prostatic portion of the- urethra on the side of the verumontanum. While the vas deferens is contained in the spermatic cord it lies posterior to the spermatic arteries and veins, and to the

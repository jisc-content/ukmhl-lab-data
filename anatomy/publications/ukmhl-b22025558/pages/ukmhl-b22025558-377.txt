367 The Axillary artery descends from the lower edge of the tirst rib, obliquely outwards to the tendon of the latissimus dorsi muscle, it is covered by the integu- ments, and at first by the external border of the great pectoral muscle, lower down by the great and lesser pectoral, and still lower down by the tendon of the great pectoral only; it passes over the 1st intercostal, and serratus magnus muscles, the brachial plexus, the sub-scapular and the tendons of the latissimus dorsi and teres major muscles; the axillary vein descends along its inner and anterior part, and the brachial plexus lies posterior and external to it, it sends off the following arteries, the thoracica acromialis, the superior and long thoracic, the subscapular, the posterior and an- terior circumflex. The acromial thoracic artery arises from the front of the axillary below the subclavian muscle, above the lesser pectoral, and opposite the fissure between the great pectoral and deltoid muscles ; it divides into se- veral branches, which pass some to the pectoral mus- cles, others to the acromion process, deltoid muscle, and integuments of the shoulder and arm, one long branch accompanies the cephalic vein, superior thoracic artery arises a little below the preceeling, sometimes in common with it, it passes forwards and inwards, and divides into branches which supply the cellular membrane and glands in the ax- illa, the pectoral muscles, the breast, and the integu- ments, ° The lo7ig thoracic artery arises below the lesser pec- toral, descends obliquely forwards along the side of the chest, parallel to the lower edge of the great pectoral, to which it sends some branches, it terminates in the intercostal muscles and integuments, and inosculates with the internal mammary and the intercostal arte- ries. The subscagulur artery arises opposite to and descends along the lower edge of the sub-scapular muscle, and soon divides into an anterior and posterior branch • the former continues to descend along the back part of the axilla, and supplies the sub-scapular, serratus magnus and latissimus dorsi muscles; the latter passes back’

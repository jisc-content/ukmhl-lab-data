tinct, in others strong and well marked, arises by seve- ral rteshy fibres from the internal angular process of the os frontis, and from the upper edge of a small horizon- tal tendon, (which tendon is about one quarter of aninch in length; it is inserted internally into the upper edge of the nasal process of the superior maxillary bone, thence it passes outwards and backwards as far as the caruncula lachrymalis, and divides into two slips, which are inserted into the tarsal cartilages, and the lachrymal ducts;) the fleshy fibres then proceed in curves, upwards and outwards, along the upper edo-e of the orbit, the eyelid, and tarsal cartilage, as far as the temple and external commissure of the eyelids; thence the fibres curve in a similar manner along the inferior eyelid and edge of the orbit to the internal canthus, where the fibres are inserted into the nasal process of the superior maxilla, and into the inferior- edge of the horizontal tendon.â€” Use, to close the eye- lids, chiefly by depressing the superior; to press the tears inwards towards the puncta lachrymalia; the su- perior and external fibres can also depress the eyebrow, and thus oppose the occipito frontalis; the inferior fibres can raise the cheek, draw the lower eyelid inwards, and compress the lachrymal sac which they cover. This muscle is covered by and adheres to the skin; supe- riorly it intermixes with the occipito-frontalis, and co- vers the corrugator supercilii, the frontal vessels and nerves, the tarsal cartilage, and levator palpebrae supe- rioris; inferiorly it intermixes with the muscles of the cheek and lips, and sometimes with the platisma myoides, and covers the inferior eyelid, the origin of the levator anguli oris and the infra-orbital vessels and nerves. The external ov orbital fibres of this muscle ai-e strong and red, and run circularly round the base of the orbit; the middle or fibres are pale, thin, and scattered, and are contained in the eyelids; the inter- nal or ciliary portion is a thick but pale fasciculus, si- tuated under the ciliae, at the edge of each eyelid. The palpebral and ciliary portion adhere more closely to the skin, and present an elliptical appearance, as the fibres, from the upper and lower eyelid, intersect each other at the outer canthus, and adhere to the ligament of a 2

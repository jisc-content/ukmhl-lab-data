193 nales, it then ascends on the back part and sides of this organ to its superior fundus, whence it is continued to the abdominal muscles; below the line of its reflection on the bladder, or below the cul de sac, we may again take notice of the triangular space on the inferior fun- us o t le bladder, before alluded to as the situation in which that viscus can be punctured from the rectum m case of retention of urine. The reflections of the peritoneum from each side of the rectum to tlie back u are called the posterior ligaments and the fold which this membrane forms on each side” between the bladder and the iliac fossa are named the lateral igaments of the bladder; these shall be more particularly noticed presently. Remark, the curved course of the rectum,itsdilatation near the anus, also the connexion of the peritonaeum to its upper and middle thirds, and obseae that the lower third of this intestine s completely^below and unattached to this membrane. i>iext study the connexions of the urinary bladder. yesica Urinaria^ when contracted, is situated in the anterior and inferior part of the pelvis behind and be low the pubes; when distended it occupies more or less of the hypogastric region ; when contracted, it appears of a flattened triangular form, the base towards the rec- tum. the apex behind the lower edge of the symphysis pubis; when distended, it presents an oval figure, Uie arger end towards the rectum, the smaller and anterior nubesTn 1^1 abdominis muscles, between the pubes and the peritonaeum ; the axis of the bladder is a fhp one extremity to wp ’ u I ‘-’"d of this line, if produced wou d touch the extremity of the coccyx, and if conti- nued anteriorly it would reach the linea alba, midway between the pubes and the umbilicus. In the verJ young subject, the bladder is of a pyriform figure, and ^ lodged in the hypogastric region. The bidder IS connected to the parietes and toihe viscera of the pelvis by folds of the peritonteum, and by the re- flections of the pelvic fascia. The folds of the perito n^um are termed false ligaments, and are five in^nurn", her, viz. two posterior, two lateral, and one sunerior • >e true ligaments are reflections of the pelvm fascia*

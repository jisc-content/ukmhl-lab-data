274 reddish colour descends, the infandihulum; this passes behind and ratlic'i- beneath the commissure of the optic nerves; it terminates on the surface of llie pituitary gland; it is surrounded by arachnoid membrane ; it is not pervious inferiorly; above it co nmunicates with the third ventricle. The pituitary bod}' is placed in the sella turcica between the dura mater and arach- noid membrane; transversely oval, composed anteriorly of a yellowish substance, which is notched before, and convex behind like a kidney, and posteriorly of a whitish semi-fluid or pulpy substance. Behind the cor- pora albicantia, we next observe a small triangular de- pression, closed above by a thin plate which forms the posterior part of the floor of the third ventricle ; this is the middle perforated plate of the brain ; on either Â«ide of this is the crus cerebri, connecting the cerebrum to the pons Varolii, which last is situated in the median line behind the last described substances ; behind the pons is the posterior extremity of the corpus callosum, and between these eminences is the great transverse fissure which transmits the pia mater into the ventricles, and which also contains the arachnoid canal and the pineal gland; behind this we observe, lastly, the pos- terior extremity of the median fissure separating the posterior lobes of the cerebrum. Cut off the upper part of one hemisphere nearly on a level with the corpus callosum, the appearance now presented is termed the centrum ovale minus, a mass of while substance surrounded by the irregularly undulat- ing line of grey substance; a small cavity or fissure may now also be oberved between the corpus callosum and the lower and internal margin of each hemisphere : next slice ofl'both hemispheres on a level with the cor- pus collosutn, and the centrum magnum ovate is pre- sented, that is, a line of grey substance surrounding the central mass of white substance. The greij or cor- tical or cineritioiis substance of the brain is .soft and pulpy, and more vascular than the while ; on the sur- face of the cerebrum it is about the eighth of an inch in thickness; in other situations it is placed in consi- derable masses, and covered by the white substance; the shade of its colour diflers in different parts of the

-157 the left or descending, and the sigmoid flexure; there i>, however, no mark of distinction whatever between these different divisions. The ascending colon extends from the cmcum to the inferior surflice of the right lobe of the liver, which it marks with a superficial depression ; this portion of the colon is concave anteriorly, and covered by the perito- naeum and by the abdominal muscles; it lies on the xight kidney ; the duodenum is connected to it internal- ly ; the superior extremity is generally tinged with bile from being in contact with the gall bladder. The transverse arch of the colon extends tortuously from the right hypochondrium, across the inferior part of the epigastric or the unbilical region into the left hj pochondrium ; it is covered by the abdominal mus- cles, and lies anterior to the small intestines: on the right side it is connected to the liver, in the middle to the stomach and to the great omentum ; and its left extiemity, which is superior and posterior to the right, IS attached to the spleen by peritonaeum; the appendices epiploicae are very numerous on this part of the colon. iheleft or descending coign extends from the spleen to the left iliac region ; it is longer than the right co- lon ; It IS connected to the left kidney and psoas muscle by the peritonaeum and cellular membrane. The sigmoid flexure is connected so loosely in the ihac fossa, that a great portion of it often lies in the pel- vis : this part of the colon is partially covered by the small intestines, and is connected to the psoas and iliac muscles, to the ureter and spermatic vessels. The rectum extends from the sigmoid flexure of the colon to the anus ; it commences opposite the left ilio- n and descends obliquely towards the middle line as far as the lower end of the sacrum • it then bends forwards towards the perinasum, and las’tlv turning downwards, it ends at the anus. The rectum is connected posteriorly to the sacrum and coccyx by the meso-rectum superiorly, and by vessels and nerves in- reriorly: anteriorly the rectum is connected to the dp- ritonaeum above, and below, in the male subject to Uie .nfer,orfu„du, „f the bladder, tbo vesicate'’ seminafes P ’

144 the existence of this pouch may conduce to the pro- duction of oblique inguinal as well as of femoral her- nia ; the internal pouch lies behind the external ring, and becomes protruded in direct or ventro-inguinal hernia. When the peritonaeum has been fully opened, we perceive its inner surface smooth and polished like all serous membranes, and filling its cavity we see the numerous digestive organs; these, though apparently within this bag, are really behind it, and only protrude the posterior side of this large sac into the cavity; no- thing is contained within the peritonaeum but the serous fluid, which is constantly exhaled, for the purpose of lubricating its opposite sides. We also obtain a partial view of the following organs, which in general occupy the same situation during life as we perceive them now to hold. Filling the right hypochondrium is the liver, with the fundus of the gall bladder projecting a little below it. In the epigastric region we see a portion of the liver also, resting on the stomach, and below it we see the pylorus and the commencement of the duode- num ; in the left hypochondrium lie the spleen and great extremity of the stomach; in the light and left lumbar regions we find the colon, ascending through the former, and descending through the latter, behind vvhich is each kidney ; the duodenum also partly occupies the right lumbar region; through the proper umbilical re- gion the transverse colon runs, not fixed however in any particular part of it, and from this intestine we perceive the great omentum descending towards the lower part of the abdomen, presenting however, very different ap- pearances in different subjects; in some being expanded over the small intestines, so as nearly to conceal them; in others being coiled up into a narrow fold, and often concealed in some recess between the surrounding viscera: the convolutions of the jejunum and ilium in- testines occupy the lower part of the umbilical, and extend indifferently into the hypogastric, and iliac regions; the caecum or caput cob is fixed in tlieiigi , and the sigmoid flexure of the colon in the left iliac fossa; the rectum and other pelvic viscera occupy the hypogastric regions, but will of course change their own situation as well as that of the small ui-

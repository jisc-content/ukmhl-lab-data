Obliquus Inferior is situated at the inferior and anterior part of the orbit; it arises tendinous from the orbital edge of the superior maxillary bone above the infra-orbital foramen, and external to the lachrymal sac, it ascends obliquely outwards and backwards be- low the inferior rectus, and is inserted by a tendinous expansion into the sclerotic coat behind the transverse axis of the eye, and between the sclerotic coat and the external rectus. Use, to draw the globe forwards and inwards, and to rotate it upwards and outwards. Recti muscles are four in number, the superior is called attollens ocuii, the inferior dejiressor oculi, the internal adductor, and the external abductor oculi; they all arise around the optic foramen; the external has an additional attachment to the foramen lacerum ; they all pass forwards around the optic nerve, separated from it by the ciliary vessels and nerves, and by a great quantity of fat; a little beyond the middle of the eye they become tendinous, and are each inserted about a quarter of an inch behind the cornea; the four tendons are connected together by an aponeurosis wdiich is at- tached to the conjunctiva ; the use of these muscles is, collectively, to retract the eye into the orbit, and indi- vidually to move it, as their names imply. Under the head of lachrymal apparatus we may considei the lachrymal gland, membrana conjunctiva, palpebrae, and lachrymal passages. The lachrymal gland IS placed in the upper part of the orbit, behind the external angular process of the os frontis, above the external rectus and the conjunctiva; of a flattened oval figure, and a pale colour, separable into two or more lobes, which, like other conglomerate glands, can be separated into numerous granules; these are united by a loose capsule; from these, five or six small ducts proceed and open behind the upper eyelid along the line of reflection of the conjunctiva from the nal- pebra to the sclerotic. ^

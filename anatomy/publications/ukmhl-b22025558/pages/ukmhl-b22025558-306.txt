29G The anterior and external portion oF each crus, which is in continuation with the corpus pyramidale, in like manner ascends and expands into Fasciculi, which may be traced into the inferior, anterior, and external con- volutions of each hemisphere. The uneven surface known by the name of convolutions appears to depend on the unequal length of these diverging fibres ; if they were all of equal extent the surface of the cerebrum rvould be smooth, but as some fall short ot others, and all are covered by the grey substance, an uneven or con- voluted surface is the result. From this grey substance which covers the surface of each convolution, the con- verging or descending fibres are described as arising, and thence passing towards the mesial line to unite with those from the opposite side ; the corpus callosum and the anterior and posterior commissures are supposed to be thus formed; in addition to these transverse pro- cesses there are several other parts which may serve as media of communication between different pans in each hemisphere of the brain, viz, the fornix, the taenia semicircularis, the pineal gland, and its pedunculi, the infundibulum, the septum lucidum, &c. &c. VESSELS OF THE BRAIN. The brain is supplied with blood by the two verte- bral and the two internal carotid arteries. The verte- bral arteries are the first branches of the subclavian arteries, each ascends through the series of foramina in the transverse processes of the cervical vertebrae, and passing through the foramen magnum into the cra- nium, they proceed obliquely forwards and inwards and end in a common trunk called the basilar artery ; each vertebral first sends off two long and delicate branches, one on the anterior, the other on the posterior surface of the spinal cord, these extend tlie whole length ot this organ, supplying it with blood, and sending out small branches along the several spinal nerves; next to these branches each vertebral gives off the interior artery of the cerebellum ; this turns backwards between the pneumo-gastric and spinal accessory nerves, and is

will be seen. The student should next attend to the situation of the epigastric vessels and their relation to the parts concerned in oblique inguinal hernia; these vessels are placed behind the fascia transversalis be- tween it and the peritonoeum, and in general can be discerned through the fascia; if not, a little dissection will render them apparent; two veins usually accom- pany the artery, one on either side; sometimes there is but one epigastric vein, and that is on the pubal or inner side of the artery ; the epigastric artery arises from the external iliac near Poupartâ€™s ligament; it first descends a little forwards and inwards, then ascends towards the rectus muscle, immediately behind the fascia transver- salis, and very near to the inner or pubal side of the in- ternal abdominal ring; in oblique inguinal hernia the neck of the sac is nearly in contact with the epigastric vessels, which thus bound it on its internal side, hence the rule of practice, in performing the operation for the relief of strangulated inguinal hernia, when the stricture is seated in the neck of the sac, is, to direct the edge of the knife or bistoury upwards and outwards. Direct or ventro-iiiguiaal hernia protrudes directly through the external ring without descending along the spermatic channel : the occurrence of this disease is in a great degree guarded against by the fascia transver- salis, and by the conjoined tendons which lie imme- diately behind the external ring; the edge of the rectus, the triangular ligament and the spermatic cord may be also all enumerated as additional protections to this part of tile abdomen: in this species of hernia the sac will be found covered only by the integuments, super- ficial fascia and some tendinous and aponeurotic bands it may have carried before it; it is not covered by the cremaster, and in general it descends along the inner side of the cord, but in some cases it passes behind it; it is never, however, found between the cremaster mus- cle and the spermatic vessels. The epigastric vessels lie to the iliac or outer side of the neck of the sac; in dividing the latter therefore, in case this operation be required during life, the edge of the knife should be di- rected upwards and inwards. When the disease of in- guinal hernia has continued for a considerable length of

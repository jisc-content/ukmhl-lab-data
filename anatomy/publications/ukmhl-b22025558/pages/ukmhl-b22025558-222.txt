212 canal of the urethra contracts a little beyond the bulb, and continues of nearly the same diameter until it ar- rives opposite the scrotum; it is there slightly con- tracted for a short distance : about an inch posterior to the external orifice of the urethra the canal is dilated in the transverse direction ; this dilation is called ybi5Â« navicularis: lastly, the orifice of the urethra is con- tracted into a narrow vertical slit. Several small lacunae open on the surface of the mucous membrane of the urethra, between the bulb and the anterior extremity ; the orifices of these, in a healthy condition of the mem- brane, are very small; they are all directed forwards: if bristles be introduced into some of these ducts they will be found in many cases to extend backwards for near an inch in the submucous tissue; these lacunae secrete a thin mucous fluid, which is expelled by the urine in its passage along the urethra: in chronic dis- eases of the urethra these ducts not unfrequently be- come so much enlarged as to admit the end of a small bougie, and so lead to the formation of a false passage ; the largest lacunae are on the upper surface of the urethra ; one in particular, near the fossa navicularis, is named the lacuna niagna.* * Daring the dissection of the pelvic viscera, perinaeum, &c. the student should frequently practise the introduction of a catheter into the bladder, which is to be done in the following manner; the subject lying on its back with the legs drawn up, the penis should be held, by placing the thumb and index-finger on each side of the corona glandis, by which means the orifice of the urethra will not be compressed ; the penis is then to be drawn upwards, and the catheter, being previously oiled, is now to be introduced in a line with the linea alba into the urethra, directly downward as far as the bulb ; the concavity of the instrument being towards the abdomen. The catheter having reached the bulb, its handle is to be depressed by bringing it forwards between the thighs, and in proportion as this is done, the point is elevated, and the catheter glides into the bladder ; in this latter part of the operation, the penis must be allowed to sink down, for if it be kept extended on the instrument, the membranous part of the urethra would be drawn towards the pubes, by vybich means the introduction of the instrument would be rendered difficult.

204 cremaiter muscle; as it passes through the internal ring it hooks round the epigastric artery, being sepa- rated from it by the spermatic artery alone; the vas defhrens next passes over the psoas and iliac muscles, the external iliac artery and vein; it then bends over the obliterated hypogastric artery and descends inter- nal to it; and in the same manner it next crosses over the ureter, so as to lie at first anterior to that tube, oi between it and the bladder, and then to descend along its internal side; the vas deferens then runs between the bladder and rectum, near to its fellow, and internal to the vesicula seminalis, as far as the prostate gland, which it perforates in the direction before mentioned. This vessel has a peculiar hard wiry feel like wliip- cord : its caliber is small; its coats are two in number, an internal raucous, and an external, very thick, hnn and white, like cartilage. Between the yesiculae each vas deferens is flattened, enlarged, and often covu- luted ; when it enters the prostate it again contracts, and its firm external tunic ceases. In some a second duct will be found to leave the testis and to run tor some distance parallel to the vas ^'eferens which in some cases it will join, while in others it will be found to end in a cul dc sac. The spermatic cord extends fioi* the enididvmis to the internal abdominal ring; it consists of the vas deferens, spermatic artery veins, and nerves; this fasciculus of vessels is covered by loose ce ulai membrane, and by the cremaster muscle: beneath the latter the vessels of the cord will be tound joined to- .rether by a fine b,ut tolerably dense membrane, named the Tunica Vaginalis of the cord ; this mernbrane is the remains of that portion of peritonaeum which m the tus accompanied the spermatic vessels ol the scro urn, and which after birth lost its seroiis characters, and be- came converted into condensed cellular membrane, i\S covering is strengthened by that prolongation ot the fascia transversalis which is continued from the in- ternal abdominal ring along the spermatic The spermatic artery arises from the abdominal ao ta below^the renal artery, and not unfrequently froni tli^e latter; it descends along the psoas rnuscle, pa^s through the internal abdominal ring on the outer side

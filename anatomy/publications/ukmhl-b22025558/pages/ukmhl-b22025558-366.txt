356 it terminates in a fimbriated margin; from the external ear it extends along the meatus externus, and covers the membrana tjunpani; inferiorly also it is continued along the mucous lining of the urethra, vagina, and rectum ; the cuticle serves to defend certain parts of the body from pressure, to protect its surface from con- tact, and to prevent evaporation. The rete mucosum is a thin vascular lamina, adhering to the cutis, con- nected to it by vessels, it has a villous appearance, and is tinged with a mucous fluid, which presents different shades of colour in different situations and in different individuals j the peculiar complexion or colour of the body depends upon this secretion: in the negro, it is very thick and black, while the cuticle is transparent and the cutis vascular and red; some anatomists divide the rete mucosum into two, and some even into three or four laminae. The cutis vera, dermis or chorion^ is much more dense than either of the preceding laminae, it is very tough and strong, in some situations more so than in others ; its internal surface is cellular, its exter- nal is smooth and very vascular, it is also highly sensi-. ble, particularly in some situations, as in the fingers and toes, where numerous nerves are distributed to it in the form of small conical or oval papillae; these are very distinct at the end of each finger, they are very vascular, and into each a nervous filament can be traced, in these papillae the sense of touch more parti- cularly resides. The subcutaneous cellular tissue is connected to the deep surface of the cutis, which is itself cellular; the cellular membrane is considered by some as a part of the integuments; in some parts of the body, particularly if exposed to pressure, the cells are filled with adeps, in other situations, where the parts are subject to motion, the cells are very loose, and only contain a fine serous exhalation ; the former species of cellular membrane has been named adipose membrane, ibe latter reticular membrane.

124 the bladder in case of retention of urine ; paracentesis, or tapping of the abdomen, in case of ascites; and the superior operation for lithotomy. The inferior fourth or fifth part of the linea alba is sometimes deficient, as also a portion of the muscles on each side ; so that the urinary bladder is superficial, and constantly exposed : in such cases the anterior part of this viscus also is usually wanting, and therefore its cavity and the orifices of the ureters can be perceived during life. The linea semilunaris extends from the tuberosity of the pubis on each side upwards and outwards, about four inches from the linea alba, towards the cartilages of the 8th and 9th ribs; it appears white, and somewhat de- pressed, and is formed by the tendon of the internal ob- lique, dividing at the edge of the rectus into two layers, to enclose this muscle in a sort of sheath. In the living subject this line may be traced by taking the point mid- way between the umbilicus and the anterior superior spi- nous process of the ilium, and from it drawing one line towards the tuberosity or spine of tbe pubis, and ano- ther towards the cartilage of the 9th rib. The opera- tion of tapping ovarian dropsy should always be per- formed here ; and this situation is also selected by some as the best for performing paracentesis in case of ascites. In this last mentioned disease, however, this line is not exactly midway between the umbilicus and spine of the ilium, but half an inch nearer the latter. The line(S transversae are three or four in number, and cross the rectus muscle from the linea alba to the linea semilunaris; they are tendinous intersections of that muscle, which adhere so intimately to its sheath, as to give to the latter this indented appearance. These lines will be again noticed in the dissection of the rec- tus ; they are much better marked in some than in others: during life they are very distinct when the abdominal muscles are in strong action. Between the linea alba and semilunaris on each side many small holes are often to be observed in the tendon of the external oblique : they are only for the transmission of small vessels and nerves ; they are generally of a square form, and are much larger and more numerous in some than

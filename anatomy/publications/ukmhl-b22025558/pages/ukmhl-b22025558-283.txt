273 size and shape, and are somewhat convoluted like tlie intestines ; their round edges are separated by fissures which are closed by the arachnoid membrane; these fissures are nearly an inch deep ; they take different di- rections, serpentine, longitudinal, and oblique; if a section of the cerebrum be made, these fissures will be found to be only involutions of the cineritious substance covering the brain ; each fissure therefore is only a continuation of the surface, and is covered throughout by the pia mater. The cerebrum, on its inferior surface, is also divided into the two hemispheres by the great median fissure at each extremit)', and in the centre by a depression con- taining several substances; each hemisphere inferiorly is divided into three lobes, the anterior, small, triangu- lar, flat, or a little concave, rests on the roof of the or- bit, presents a deep groove which lodges the olfactory nerve; the middle lobe is prominent, round, and deep, fills up the middle fossa in the base of the cra- nium, and is separated from the anterior lobe by a deep fissure, (Jissura Sylvii) which ascends obliquely out- wards and backwards; this fissure corresponds to the sphenoidal fold of the dura mater, and to the lesser wing of the sphenoid bone; the brain above it is per- forated by a number of small holes for the entrance of vessels (pars perjoree externe ;) this fissure contains the middle artery of the brain, and one origin of the olfactory nerve. The posterior lobe rests on the tento- rium, and is separated from the middle only by a slight excavation ; between the hemispheres we observe, im- mediately behind the anterior extremity of the median fissure, the lower end of the corpus callosum ; posterior to this, and connected to it is the commissure of the optic nerves ; behind this is a soft grey substance, the tuber cinereiim ; this is connected anteriorly to these nerves, and posteriorly to two small white bodies termed the corpora mamillaria or albicantia: these are about the size of small peas, situated behind the tuber cinereum, and attached by it to each other; they are grey internally, although white externally, the anterior pillars of the formax terminate in these. From the centre of the tuber cinereum a thin conical tube of a

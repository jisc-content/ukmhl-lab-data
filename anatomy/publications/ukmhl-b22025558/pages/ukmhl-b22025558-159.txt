149 is thin and delicate; it ascends in front of the inferior and middle portions of the duodenum, and of the pan- creas; it also covers the aorta and vena cava, and conti- nues along this latter vessel to the liver, on the spigelian lobe of tvhich it expands, and on it and on the right lobe, behind the foramen of Winslow, it becomes conti- nuous with the peritonaeum, which has been reflected on the back part of the liver from the diaphragm. As this ascending layer proceeds in front of the pancreas, it is continuous on each side with the posterior layer of the fesser omentum which covers the back part of the sto- mach. This ascending la3'er may be best seen and traced by dividing the great omentum a little below the stomach, and raising this organ towards the thorax ; we shall thus lay open the cavity of the omentum, and shall be able to trace the parietes of this bag through their whole extent. The cavity of the omentum extends from the trans- verse fissure of the liver superiorly, to the lower border of the great omentum inferiorly; it is bounded anteriorly by the lesser omentum, the stomach, and the anterior or descending portion of the great omentum; inferiorly it is formed by the great omentum turning on itself; and posteriorly it is bounded by the ascending portion of the great omentum, by the colon, by the transverse meso-colon, and by the superior or ascending layer of this process, which terminates at the liver. The cavity of the ornentum communicates with the general perito- naeal cavity through the foramen of Winslow; this open- ing is situated in the lower part of the right hypochon- driac region just above the right lumbar ; it is somewhat oval, bounded anteriorly by the lesser omentum and by the hepatic vessels, posteriorly by the termination of the ascending layer of the meso-colon which invests the vena cava, superiorly by thelobulus caudatus of the liver, and inferiorly by the superior portion of the duodenum; if the membrane composing the omenta be perfect, and if air be ^rced through this opening, it will descend behind the stomach, and will inflate the omental cavity â€¢ the great omentum, however, in general is so cribriform that this experiment cannot be performed ; the princi- pal use of this cavity is most probably to afford a serous o2

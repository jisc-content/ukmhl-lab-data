487 common situation we find it in is between the convex surface of the liver and diaphragm ; when it opens, it is by ulcerated communications with the stomach or transverse arch of the colon. Stomach. Inflammation of the stomach is rare, ex- cept in cases of poison; when it is inflamed, the mu- cous membrane appears pulpy and very vascular, occasionally with some extravasation of blood be- tween the middle and mucous coats : ulcers of the stomach are sometimes to be met with, they are un- like ulcerations in other parts; they are generally circular in their shape, with the edges smooth, defined and looking as if they were healed; the stomach is thickened in their neighbourhood, although this is not always the case ; an appearance that may be confound- ed with ulcer of the stomach is, where tbe gastric juice acts upon this organ after death, and produces digestion of its several coats ; this latter process causes a lacerated ragged appearance of the edges, while an ulcer of the stomach looks as if a circular piece were removed by the cut of a knife. Pylorus. The pyloric extremity of the stomach is often found much thickened; this induration is general- ly of a cancerous nature, it is sometimes so great, as to prevent the passage of the food into the duodenum* when it extends into the stomach this organ becomes indurated, ulceration takes place, and cancer of the stomach is then said to exist. Intestines. I he intestinal canal is very subject to inflammation, increased vascularity of the mucous coat with thickening of all the tunics, denote this inflamma-â€™ non ; except in violent states of inflammation, the pe- ritoneal coat is not engaged. The colour of the intestine IS sometimes very dark, from a large quantity of black extravasated blood retained between its tunics ; this appearance is often improperly mistaken for mortifica- tion ; when the inflammation is confined to the mucous coat, it often terminates in ulceration; the ulcers which are on the mucous membrane have some difference in their appearance, sometimes having at hickened raised edge, and at others, not elevated at all above the surface- according to some, ulceration more frequently take.s

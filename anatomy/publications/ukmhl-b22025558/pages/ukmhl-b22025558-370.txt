360 rior to the masseter muscle, and then ascends oblique- ly forwards and inwards towards the side of the nose ; in the neck it gives off, 1st, injerior palatine, which ascends along the side of the pharynx, and supplies the velum and the amygdala; the branch to the latter often arises distinctly; 2nd, glandular to the sub- niaxillary and adjoining lymphatic glands ; 3rd, sub- mental runs along tlie mylo-liyoid muscle to the chin, and supplies the surrounding muscles. On the face it gives off, 4th, inferior labial to the muscles and in- teguments between the lip and the chin; 5th, the inferior and superior coronary, these run along the border of tbe lips close to the mucous membrane and directly join those from the opposite side; 6th, late- ralis nasi to the muscles and skin on the side and dor- sum of the nose; and 7th, angularis, which commu- nicates with the ophthalmic. The w?Â«scii/ar flrier.y descends obliquely backwards, divides into several branches, which are principally distributed to the sterno-mastoid muscle and to the surrounding cellular tissue and glands. The occipital artery arises opposite the labial, as- cends obliquely backwards behind the digastric, then curves horizontally backwards between the mastoid process and the atlas, and near the mesial line it ascends on the occiput; it gives off several muscular branches, some to the mastoid and trapezius muscles, several to the deep muscles on the side and back of the neck, and on the occiput it divides into tortuous branches, which ascend in different directions in the scalp, and inosculate with the different arteries in that region. The posterior auricular artery arises above, often in common with the occipital; it ascends behind the parotid and between the meatus auditoris and the mastoid process; it divides into several branches vvhich are lost in the-integuments of the ear and in the scalp. The inferior or ascending pharyngeal artery arises near the division of the common carotid, ascends ver- tically to the base of the skull, and sends off several pharyngeal and palatine branches, and ends in a small

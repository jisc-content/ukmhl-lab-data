272 lateral ventricle between the optic thalamus and the hippocampus major; tlirougli these lateral prolongations of this fissure, a process of the pia mater enters, termed the choroid plexus, and through the central or trans- verse portion of ii, another process, termed the choroid membrane or velum interpositum ; these processes are covered by the arachnoid membrane, and are all con- nected together, as will be seen in the dissection of the ventricles ; this great fissure in the brain is closed everj' where by the aracluioid membrane on the surface of the brain, except at the foramen of Bichat. The use of the pia mater is to form an exact capsule for the brain, also an extensive surface, on which the vessels divide minutely, and are probably arranged in some peculiar manner, previous to their penetrating the sub- stance of the brain. There are two modes of dissecting the brain ; first, by removing it in successive slices from above down- wards; and secondly, from below upwards; the first plan is best adapted for studying the relative anatomy of the different parts of the brain, or for examining this organ pathologically; the second for unravelling its structure; the student should practise both, and first, that from above downwards. DISSECTION OF THE CEREBRUM. The Cerebrum is the largest part of the brain, of an oval figure, the larger end posteriorly, a little flat- tened on the sides, convex above, and divided into two equal portions, the right and left hemispheres, by a deep fissure which extends along the median line; this fissure is continued before and behind through the en- tire depth of the cerebrum, but in the middle it is bounded below by the corpus callosum ; it contains the falx cerebri and the arteries of the corpus callosum; each hemisphere is convex superiorly and externally, and flat internally, or towards the falx, inferiorly very irregular and uneven*; the surface of each hemisphere is every where marked by a number of eminences term- ed the convolutions of the brain ; these are of various

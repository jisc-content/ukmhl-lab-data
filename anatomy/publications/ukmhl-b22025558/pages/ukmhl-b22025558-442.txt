432 the sides, ossci triquetra are often entangled in the notches- Tlie internal or cerebral surface is concave, and marked by two lines which cross about the centre, or opposite the tuberosity, these bound four fossae, the two superior receive the posterior lobes of the-cere- brum, and are marked by their convolutions, the infe- rior are smooth, and lodge the hemispheres of the cere- bellum, to the vertical ridge is attached the falx ce- rebri above and falx cerebelli below; the lower extre- mity of the latter is bifurcated, the upper half is grooved for the longitudinal sinus; to the transverse ridge the tentorium is attached, it is grooved for il)c lateral sinus ; the basilar process is concave from side to side, to support the pons Varolii and the basilar ar- tery ; on either margin of it is a slight groove for tire inferior petrosal sinus ; on each side of the foramen magnum above the jugular processes is a groove for the lower extremit}- of the lateral sinus. This bone is joined to six bones, viz. the two parietal, two temporal, the sphenoid and the atlas. Its processes are six, namely, two condyles, two jugular, the basilar, and the tuberosity. Its foramina are five proper and two com- mon ; the proper are, the magnum, the two anterior and twm posterior condyloid; the common are, the foramina lacera postica basis cranii, these foramina are completed by the petrous bone, each is imperfectly di- vided into two, a small anterior portion which transmits the eighth pair of nerves, and a larger posterior w'hich lodges the termination of the lateral sinus in the com- mencement of the internal jugular vein. This is a very hard bone, although thin throughout except at the ridges and processes; it is developed from four points, one for the basilar process, one for each condyle, and one for the upper and back part. The Temporal Bones are situated at the lateral, middle and inferior parts of the skull, of a very irregular shape, thin above and before, and thick behind and below ; each may be divided into three portions, the squamous, the mastoid, and the petrous. The pars squamosa is the superior division, it is flat, thin, and scaly, forms part of the temporal fossa, is bounded above by a semicircuhuâ€™ edge, and below by the zygomatic process, which is

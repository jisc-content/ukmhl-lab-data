448 Jar plate, at the lower and outer angle of which is 3rd, the pteiygoid process; and 4th, at the upper extremity of the nasal is the orbital portion ; the palate process or plate is nearly square, flat, and rough below, smooth above, and concave from side to side to form part of the floor of the nose, posteriorly it has a thin edge to which the velum palati is attached ; its anterior border is serrated to join the palate plate of the maxillary bone, its inner edge rises into a spine or crest to support the vomer, and is continued posteriorly into the posterior nasal spine ; its centre is thinner than its edges. The nasal process or vertical plate is broad and thin, rests partly on the maxillary bone, its inner or nasal surface forms part of the nasal fossa, and is marked by two de- pressions which assist in forming the lower and middle meatus of the nose, the ridge between these supports the lower spongy bone, externally it is uneven and grooved for the posterior palatine vessels and nerves; the anterior edge of this plate is thin and brittle, and prolonged for some way over the antrum, the posterior edge joins the pterygoid processes. The tuberosity or the ^pterygoid process arises from the lower and outer angle, is thick and wedge-shaped, it inclines backwards and outwards, and presents three fossae, one at each side for each pterygoid plate, and one in the middle which assists in forming the pterygoid fossa; the inner- most of these fossae is the deepest : this process is per- forated by one or two small holes which lead from the palatine canal: at the upper extremity of the nasal plate are the orbital and sphenoidal processes, separated from each other by a deep notch; the orbital is the larger and anterior of the two, it is triangular and bent a little outwards, it appears in the most remote part of the floor of the orbit, where it is joined to the maxilla- ry bone by one edge, to the os planum by the second, while the third enters into the spheno maxillary fissure; the sphenoidal or posterior orbital process is smaller and is articulated to the body and spongy plate of the sphenoid bone; both these processes are cellular, the cells communicate with those of the sethmoid and sphe- noid bones; the notch between these two processes forms the spheno palatine hole j the palate bone is

230 DISSECTION OF THE MUSCLES OF THE IIIF. These are, the three glutiei, tlie pyriformis, the gemini, the two obturator, and the quadratus femoris. Gluteus Maximus covers the greater part of the pelvis, also the upper part of the thigh ; it is somewhat square, one edge being attached to the sacrum, the op- posite edge to the femur, and to the fascia lata, the other edges are directed one upwards and forwards, the other downwards and backwards. The inferior edge is thick and round, and covered by a great quantity of fat; this forms \X\e fold of the nates. It is difficult to clean the surface of the glutasus maximus, its fasciculi are so coarse and rough, this may be facilitated by dis- secting parallel to the fibres, that is, in a line drawn from the sacrum towards the great trochanter. This muscle arises by fleshy and short aponeurotic fibres, from the posterior fifth of the crest of the ilium, from the rough surface between the crest and the superior semicircular ridge on this bone, from the posterior ilio-sacral ligaments and lumbar fascia, from the tuber- cles on the posterior surface of the sacrum, the side of the coccyx, and from the great sciatic ligament,, which last it covers; the fibres are collected into distinct fas- ciculi, which descend obliquely outwards and forwaids, nearly parallel to each other, converging a little to- wards the thigh ; the lower fibres are the lougfsh |bey all form a strong and dense mass, particularly below, and end in aflatand thick tendon, whose external surface is rough and coarse, but the internal smooth and hneh l)v a bursa which separates it from and allows it to Mide over tho great trochanter; this tendon is inserted fnto a rough edge which leads from the trochanter to the linca aspera, also into the upper third of that line, and by a tendinous expansion into the fascia lata, cc- -ieringr the vastus externus muscle. Vsey to extend the thigh! also to abduct and rotate it outwards, to support the pelvis and the trunk on the lower extremity, a so to make tense the fascia lumborum and the fascia lata. The glutaeus maximus is covered by the integuments.

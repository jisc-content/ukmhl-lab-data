477 of the Srd is nearly plane, and rests on the magnum, and presents on either side articulating surfaces for the contiguous metacarpal bones ; the base of the ^th pre- sents two articulating surfaces, one for the magnum and one for the unciform; on the radial side two, and on the ulnar side one articulating surface, for the adjacent metacarpal bones; the base of the 5th presents a con- cave surface, directed outwards to articulate with the unciform ; its radial side articulates with the base of the 4th metacarpal bone. The anterior, or digital ends of all the metacarpal bones are convex, their smooth sur- faces extending further on the palmar than on the dor- sal surfaces of each; they are articulated with the bases of the first phalanges. The Fingers are composed each of three phalanges, except the thumb, which has only two ; there are there- fore 14 phalanges in all; the Jirst, or those next the metacarpus, are the largest, the third are the smallest, tlie 2nd or middle are of an intermediate size. The metacarpal, or the first phalanges are 5 in number; the base or posterior end of each presents an oval cavity for the head of the metacarpal bone; the anterior ex- tremity of each presents two small condyles, separated by a groove; these are prolonged anteriorly, and articu- late with the second or middle phalanx ; the anterior surface of each is arched from before backwards, hol- lowed from side to side, to lodge the flexor tendon, the sheath of which is attached to its lateral edges ; the posterior surface is convex and arched. The second or middle phalanges are 4 in number, they are smaller than the first; the base of each presents a pulley-like surface to articulate with the first, with which it forms ginglymoid joint; about the centre of their anterior surface is a rough depression for the insertion of the tendon of the flexor sublimis; the anterior or digital extremity of each resembles the anterior end of the first phalanx, and is convex from before backwards, and concave from side to side ; the two articulating condyles being prolonged on the palmar further than on the dorsal surface, so as to increase the extent of flexion ; the thumb wants this second phalanx. The third or last or ungual phalanges are five in number, they are the

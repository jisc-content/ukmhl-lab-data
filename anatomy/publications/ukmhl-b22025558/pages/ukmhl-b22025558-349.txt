339 SECTION IL ORGAN OF TASTE. The organ ofla&te resides in the mucous membrane of the tongue ; this membrane is spread over the mus- cular substance of the tongue, adheres closely to it, and presents a number of projections or papillae; the tongue is very vascular and is supplied with six nerves; the gustatory is distributed anteriorly and chiefly to the papillae, the lingual to the inferior surface and to its muscular substance, the glosso-pharnygeal to the mus- cular substance and mucous membrane at its base ; ex- periments have proved that the 5th nerve endows this organ with its peculiar sense, that of taste; and that the lingual or 9th is its motor nerve; the glosso-pha- ryngeal is probably for the purpose of connecting the tongue in sympathy with the stomach and the respira- tory organs ; the form of the tongue has been already described, (see page 36.) SECTION III. ANATOMY OF THE EAR. The parts composing this complicated organ may be divided into three classes; the 1st concludes the exter- nal ear, or the cartilages and meatus externus ; the 2d the tympanum with the Eustachian., tube, ossicula au- ditus and mastoid cells ; the 3d the labyrinth or inter- nal ear, which includes the vestibule, semi-circular canals, cochlea, and meatus internus with the portio mollis. 'l\\Q external ear consists of the pinna or auricle and the meatus externus ; the 'pinna is composed of a thin fibro-cartilaginous plate, curved in different directions, so as to present different eminences and depressions ; the convex edge which forms the outline of it is the helix, below this is a short semicircular fold, the anti, helix, this divides superiorly into two crura; the de- if

Pl.ace the detached extremity on its fore-part, with a block beneath the hip joint, so as to flex the latter Rightly, and thus extend the muscles in this region Raise the integuments from the posterior surface of the limb, from the crest of the ilium to the calf of the leo- • the cutaneous nerves which are met with in this dissec- tion, are branches from the lumbar nerves, from the sacral plexus, and from the sciatic nerve. The cutaneous veins pass in different directions, some turn round the inner side of the limb to the saphena vein, others pene- trate between the muscles and join the deep veins vvhich accompany the muscular or the perforating arteries, and others descend to the popliteal space, and join the popliteal or the lesser saphena vein. The fascia lata o\er the glutpus maximus is weak, but anterior to that muscle, that is covering the glutmus raedius, it is very strong, and adheres to the surface of this muscle, and of he ^‘""\»bove it; on the posterior part high, the fascia is not so dense as on the outer or anterior part ; inferiorly, over the popliteal region, ►Mah '‘”1'^^ stronger than above; front the thiph u is continued over the muscles of the leg in which situation it maybe examined afterwards: the ascia and integuments being removed, the muscles should be cleanly dissected; these may be divided into ilm muscles of the hip amkof the thight

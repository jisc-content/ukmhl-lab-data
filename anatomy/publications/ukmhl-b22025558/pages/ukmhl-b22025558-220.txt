210 spongy portion. The first, or the prostatic portion of the urethra is within the pelvis ; it is about an inch and a quarter, or an inch and a half in length; in the erect position of the body its direction is downwards and for- w'ards; it is nearer to the upper than to the lower sur- face of the gland. The membranous portion is about half an inch long ; it is described in general as being concave towards the pubes; it is, however, but very slightly so, it runs nearly horizontal, about three quar- ters of an inch below the symphysis pubes. The spongy portion commences in the bulb in front of the trian- gular ligament, extends to the extremity of the canal, and ends in the glans penis; this part of the canal is surrounded by a vascular and cellular texture, named the corpus spongiosum urethrae,which has some resemblance to the corpora cavernosa penis. The corpus spongiosum urethrae consists of a number of fine cells, which com- municate with each other; through these an aiterj'from each side, (a branch from the internal pudic) extends; these vessels send oft numerous branches, which pour their blood into the surrounding cells, from which the veins afterwards absorb it: the bulb and the glans penis are expansions of this cellular texture, the formei on the inferior, the latter on the superior part and sides* This Spongy substance is invested by a fine, but strong and semi-transparent aponeurosis very diffemit from that which covers the corpora cavernosa. The corpus spongiosum surrounds the urethra, but is thicker inferiorly and laterally than superiorly; there is no di- rect communication between the corpus spongiosum urethrm and the corpora cavernosa penis, the one can therefore, be distended with air or injectimi without the other, or both may be injected with different co- loured fluids. In order to inject the crura penis, make a small opening in each crus near its attachment to the ischium, insert a pipe into one of these, and force warm water through it; this will soon escape through the opening in the opposite crus, carrying along with it the blood which was contained m the cells, then secuie with a ligature the opposite crus, and inject some co-

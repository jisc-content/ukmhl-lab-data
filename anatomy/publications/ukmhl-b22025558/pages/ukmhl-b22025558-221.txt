211 loured fluid. To prepare the corpus spongiosum ure- thr$, make a small opening in the substance of the bulb, next, open the dorsal vein of the penis, in it se- cure a small pipe, water injected through this will escape at the opening in the bulb; when all the blood shall have been thus washed out, the latter opening may be secured, and some coloured fluid injected along the dorsal vein. ° If, however, a fine injection be forced from the pudic, or from the internal iliac artery, it maybe made to distend the corpora cavernosa penis, and the corpus spongiosum urethrae at one and the same time. The student may now detach the crura penis and the neck ot the bladder from the pubes, and remove these organs together with the urethra from the subject; continue an incision from the anterior part of the bladder through the upper part of the prostate gland, and of the urethra to Its extremity; the mucous lining of the urethra will be thus exposed, the difference in the diameter and other peculiarities m different parts of it may now also be observed. 1st, The prostatic portion is somewhat contracted at either extremity, and dilated in the cen- rc, particularly on the lower surface, and at either side ot the middle line; these enlargements are called the j^ostatic sinuses ; they are separated from each other y a prominent fold of the lining membrane, extending rom the uvula of the bladder along the mesial line of the urethra, as far as the bulb ; this fold is named verii- monlanum, or caput galhnaginis ; in the centre of it is a very Jarge lacuna, (sinus pocularisj, the orifice of which IS directed forwards ; on either side of thfs pouch an in general external to it, is the opening of the com- mon ejaculatory duct, external to which, and i^the prostatic sinus on each side are the several small ori- fices of the ducts of the prostate gland. 2d, The mem- branous portion is shorter, and of a smaller caliber than the prostatic ; it is cylindrical, its anterior extremity is oortioTTfh """'r ”■ The spongy r.dn I • J dilated at first, parti- cularly inferiorly (sinus of the bulb); anterior to^ this e small ducts of the anti-prostatic glands open.

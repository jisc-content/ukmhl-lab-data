238 by the glutseus maximus, and passing over the gemini, obturator, and quadratus muscles; its course along the back of the thigh, and its branches, shall be considered after the dissection ol the following muscles. DISSECTION OE THE MUSCLES ON THE BACK PART OF THE THIGH. The fascia in this situation has been already noticed; the muscles are only three in number, and are com- monly called hamstrings ; the semi-tendinosus and semi- membranosus form the inner, the biceps the outer ham- string. Biceps Flexor Cruris, consists of a long and short head; the long head arises from the outer and back part of the tuber ischii in common with the semi-tendi- nosus, this descends obliquely outwards, and soon ends in a thick fleshy belly; about the inferior third of the thigh it joins, at an acute angle, the short head, which arises fleshy from the linea aspera, between the vastus externus and tliQ, adductors, commencing below the insertion of the glutaeus maximus, and continuing to within two inches of the external condyle; here the muscle ends in a strong tendon, which descends at first behind the knee, then turns forwards and outwards towards the haad of the fibula, into which it is inserted ; the tendon is here divided in general by the external lateral ligament into two fasciculi, the superficial of which, in addition to its attachment to the head of the fibula, is also inserted into the fascia of the leg; and the deep fasciculus which is also inserted into the fibula, sends some fibres to the head of the tibia. Use, to flex the knee-joint, also, by its long head, to extend the thigh and rotate the whole limb outwards ; tlie long head can also fix the pelvis, and prevent it and the trunk from bending forwards on the head of the femur. The superior fiftli of this muscle is concealed by the glutaeus maximus, the remainder is covered by the integuments and fascia, and descends between the vastus externus and semi-tendinosus, forming the outer hamstring; the long head passes over the semi-mem-

236 fei'ior surface of the lhyr6id or obturator ligament, and from the surrounding surface of the pubis and ischium, the fibres descend obliquely outwards and backwards behind the neck of the femur, in a sort of notch or groove between the tuber ischii and the edge of the acetabulum ; here they end in a strong tendon, which ascends a little behind the neck of the femur, then runs directly outwards along the inferior gemellus, and adhering to the capsular ligament, is inserted into the lower part of the digital fossa. Use, to adduct the thigh, and to rotate it outwards; it also supports and strengthens the inferior and posterior part of the ilio- femoral articulation, particularly in abduction of the thigh. This muscle is placed in a very deep situation, being covered, anteriorly, by the adductor brevis and peclinscus, also by the obturator nerve and vessels, in- ternally by the adductor muscles, externally by the joint, and posteriorly by the quadratus femoris and glu- taeus maximus. The several small muscles just described, in addition to their individual actions, effect the common purpose of strengthening the ilio-femoral articulation ; the cap- sular ligament of this joint is covered anteriorly by the rectus, psoas, and iliacus; internally by the pectinseus and obturator externus; externally by the tendon of the rectus, the glutaeus minimus and medius, and pos- teriorly by the pyriform, geraini, obturator tendons, quadratus femoris, and glutaeus maximus; many of these muscles, like the small capsular muscles of the shoulder joint, guard against dislocation in the different motions of the limb, and also serve to protect the cap- sular ligament by drawing it out of the angle which is formed between the acetabulum and the neck of the femur in the rotatory motions of the limb. In dissecting the foregoing muscles, several vessels and nerves must have been remarked ; the former are derived from the hypogastric or internal iliac vessels; the latter from the sacral plexus of nerves ; the arteries are the glutaeal, sciatic, and pudic. Thegluteeal artery escapes through the upper part of the sciatic notch, above the pyriform muscle, and immediately divides into several branches; these are distributed to the

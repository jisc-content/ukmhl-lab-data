387 glands ; the lymphatics from the inferior extremi- ties and trom the pelvis ascend towards the spine, form a plexus round tlie iliac arteries, and pass be- hind the aorta close to the vertebrae, and terminate in the receptaculum cliyli, or the commencement of the thoracic duct, into which numerous lymphatic or lacteal vessels open from the intestinal canal. The lacteal or chyliferous vessels commence from open mouths on the surface of the intestine, and thence pass through the mesenteric glands, increasing in size and dinainishing in number, towards the spine. The lymphatics of the stomach take the course of the arteries ot that viscus, also towards the spine, and join the thoracic duct. The lymphatics of the liver are su- perficial and deep, the former are very distinct, some pass back towards the spine, others ascend along the falciform ligament, enter the thorax, and proceed through the anterior mediastinum to the thoracic duct near its termination ; the deep lymphatics pass, some out of the transverse fissure, others from the posterior edge of the liver on the diaphragm, all then pass back towards the spine. The thoracic canal commences on the body of the t^d or 3d lumbar vertebra by a large dilatation, named ihe receptaculum chyli; it then ascends between the crura of the diaphragm into the posterior mediastinum, and is situated on the right of the aorta, on theleft of the vena ^ygos, and behind the oesophagus ; -with these relations, it rises to about the 5th dorsal vertebra, and then crosses the spine obliquely to the leftside, passing behind the oesophagus and the arch of the aorta; it then again ascends, and is placed beneath the left pleura, between the left carotid and subclavian arteries, and along the left side of the oesophagus, it iises into the neck, as high as the 6th vertebra, behind the carotid and thyroid arteries, and jugular vein ; it then curves outwards and downwards, and opens into the leu subclavian vein, close to the jugular. Two valves internally protect this opening, these are situated one at either side. Ihe thoracic duct receives in its course along the thorax several branches from the Jungs, the heart, and the parietes of the chest; in

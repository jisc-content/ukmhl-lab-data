I lo « conceals the insertion of the temporal, and the origin of the buccinator, from which it is separated by a great quantity of fat ; the superficial layer covers the deep one, except a small portion of the latter near the arti- culation of the maxilla; strong tendinous septa pass from the surface of this muscle through its substance, and adhere to the ramus of the bone beneath. Temporalis, is concealed by the temporal aponeu- rosis, the zygoma, and the masseter. The aponeurosis is very strong and tense, of a semicircular form, adher- ing by its superior convex border to the semicircular ridge on the side of the cranium, which extends from the external angular process of the frontal as far back as the mastoid process of the temporal bone, and by its inferior straight margin to the upper edge of the zygo- ma; this fascia consists of two laminae, which are very distinct inferiorly, some fat being interposed ; the fibres composing the external layer run longiludinall}^ those of the internal irregularly. The temporal aponeurosis confines the muscle in its place, and gives additional origin to its fibres. Separate the masseter from its su- perior attachment, divide with the saw the zygoma at either end, and elevate it together with the lower part of the temporal fascia; the temporal muscle will be thus exposed. It omc^from all the side of the cranium be- neath the semicircular ridge on the parietal bone, and from all the temporal fossa and fascia; the fibres there- fore are attached internally to the parietal, frontal, and temporal bones, also to the sphenoid as low down as the crest at the root of its creat wing; anteriorly to the ma- lar bone, and externally to the inside of the temporal fascia, and to the zygomatic arch. The fleshy fibres all descend converging; the middle nearly vertical; the anterior with a little obliquity backwards; the pos- terior, which are verj’ long, pass nearly horizontally forwards, over a smooth surface at the root of the zygo- ma, and the inferior fibres, which arise from the crest on the sphenoid bone are very short, and pass trans- versely outwards. Inserted by a strong tendon into the coronoid process of the inferior maxilla ; it surrounds that process, and is continued along its fore part as far as the last molar c

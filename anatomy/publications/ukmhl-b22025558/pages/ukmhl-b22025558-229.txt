•219 backwards, and is lost on the sheath of the femoral vessels. That part of the fascia which is internal to this opening is named the pubic portion of the fascia lata; it covers the pectinaeus muscle, adheres to the spine and linea innominata of the pubis, extends behind the femoral vessels, and is continuous with the fascia iliaca ; that part ot the fascia lata external to the saphenic opening is called the iliac portion; it covers the sar- torius, tensor vaginae, rectus, and iliacus internus mus- cles, and is continued obliquely in front of the femoral vessels, in the form of a crescentic or Jalciforni 'process, the concavity of wliich is directed downwards and in- wards; the convexity is towards the ilium, and attached to PoLipart’s ligament; the lower cornu of this crescen- tic process is continuous with the outer cornu of the saphenic opening, and the upper cornu extends in front of the femoral vessels to their inner side, and is inserted along with the third insertion of Poupart’s ligament into the linea innominata, or theilio pectinaea: between the margin of the falciform process and the pubic part of the fascia lata is a thin membrane, perforated b\'^ numsrousvessels, this is termed the cribriform fascia; It is connected on either side to the iliac and pubic porl tions of the fascia lata, and extends from the saphena vein to Poupart s ligament, in front of the femoral ves- sels; it adheres to the anterior part of the sheath of the latter, or to the fascia transversalis ; when this cribri- form fascia is removed, the falciform process is made more distinct.— (See Description of Crural Hernia, page 135.) The fascia lata, in some situations, parti- cularly along the outer side of the limb, is seen to con- sist ol two laminae of fibres; the external take a circular, the internal a longitudinal direction; these two laminm are very distinctly separated at the upper and outer part of the thigh by the insertion of the tensor vaginae femoris; the deep layer, which in this situation is verv strong, is attached to the capsular ligament of the hip joint, and to the external head of the rectus muscle Raise the fascia lata from the anterior and lateral parts of the thigh, several muscles will come into view, the femoral vessels also in the groin will be partially ex- posed, they are still somewhat concealed by a quantity

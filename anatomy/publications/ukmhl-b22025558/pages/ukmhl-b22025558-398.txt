388 tlie neck, the lymphatics from the left arm and left side of the head, face, and neck, open into it. The lymphatics of the upper extremities are superficial and deep, the former accompany the sub-cutaneous veins to the elbow, and a little above the bend of the joint they pass inwards through a small gland that is situated above the inner condyle; they then join the deep lymphatics, and ascend along the inner side of the arm to the axilla, pass through the axillary conglobate glands, surround the axillary artery, and pass with it beneath the clavicle into the neck, where they are joined by the lymphatics from the neck and shoulder. On the left side these branches end in the thoracic duct; on the right side they form a short canal (called the right or lesser thoracic duct) which opens into the right or left vena innominaia, at the upper part of the anterior mediastinum. ANATOMY OF THE FQ3TAL CIRCULATION. The umbilical vein which arises by numerous branches from the placenta, and extends along the umbilical cord, twisted round the umbilical arteries, enters the umbilicus of the foetus, ascends obliquely backwards, enclosed in the duplicature of the falci- form ligament, behind the linea alba, and the right rectus muscle ; it arrives at the notch in the ante- rior edge of the liver, proceeds backw'ards along the horizontal fissure, sending branches to either side, particularly to the left lobe, which at this period of life is of considerable size. When the umbilical vein arrives near the transverse fissure, it divides into two branches; the right or communicating, the left or the ductus venosus, the right is the larger, it passes transversely for about an inch, and joins the trunk of the vena portae; the lej't, or the ductus venosus, ascends between the left and spigelian lobes towards the diaphragm, and joins the middle hepatic veins just as these are about to join the vena cava. The right auricle distended with blood from the superior and inferior vena cava, then contracts and propels its

460 tinct and bifurcated below. The lower or tarsal end of the tibia is somewhat square, presents an anterior convex edge covered by the extensor tendons, a pos- terior nearly smooth edge traversed by a groove for the tendon of the flexor pollicis longus, externally is a concave triangular surface, rough above for ligaments, and smooth aod cartilaginous below to receive the lower end of the fibula; internally the tibia ends in a thick flattened perpendicular process, the internal malleolus or ankle ; it is convex and subcutaneous, it lies an- terior to the superior internal tuberosity on account of the twisting of the bone ; the outer side of this process is smooth and cartilaginous, and joined at right angles to the cavity at the lower end of the bone; it is articu- lated to the side of the astragalus, its anterior edge is convex and gives attachment to ligaments, its posterior edge is grooved superficially for the tendons of the tibi- alis j)Osticus and flexor communis, the extremity of this process is broad and descends lower before than behind, it gives origin to the internal lateral ligament of the ankle ; the lower surface of the tibia is quadrilateral, concave from before backwards, and somewhat convex from side to side, being traversed from before back- wards by a very superficial ridge or prominence, this surface is broader externally, it is bounded internally by the internal malleolus, and externally by the fibula; the tibia is articulated to the femur, the fibula and as- tragalus ; its ossification commences in three points, one for the shaft, and one for each extremity, the tubercle at the upper end of the crest, and the malleolus are sometimes found as epiphyses. The Fibula is very slender and nearly as long as the tibia; it is placed at the side of the leg, nearly vertical, its lower end inclined a little forwards ; the superior or femoral e/zr/is small and circular, and presents a slight cavity forwards, upwards and inwards, to articulate with the tuberosity on the external condyle of the tibia, behind this is a slight pyramidal projection, its whole circumference is rough for the insertion of ligaments which attach it to the tibia, also for the external lateral ligament of the knee joint, and for the tendon ot the biceps; below this the bone is round and slender like a

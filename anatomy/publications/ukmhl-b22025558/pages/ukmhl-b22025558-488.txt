478 smallest, somewhat of a pyramidal form; the base articulates with the 2nd phalanx, and presents a pulley- like surface, having two sm'all cavities and a middle ridge, such as the base of the 2nd phalanx; their pos- terior surface, convex, supports the nail, their anterior rough and irregularly concave, for the attachment of the flexor tendon and ligaments ; its anterior extremity or apex is irregularly tuberculated to support the extre- mity of the finger. The phalanges in structure resem- ble metacarpal bones; the last are more cellular, and have no medullary canal ; they are developed each from two points of ossification, one for the shaft, and one for the anterior extremity; the posterior end is con- tinued from the shaft. On the articulation between the metacarpal bone and the first phalanx of the thumb there are ge- nerally two sesamoid hones, and sometimes one in the corresponding joint of the index finger; these bones, like those in the foot, as well as in other situations, where they are occasionally found, as behind the con- dyles of the femur, in the heads of the gastrocnemii muscles, do not properly belong to the osseous system, they are rather accessories to the tendons of muscles ; they are found in the limbs only, and generally in the direction of flexion ; they are developed from cartilage, which is deposited in tendinous or ligamentous struc- ture, and are very slow to ossify ; the patella has some resemblance to bones of this class, it is however more perfect, and is placed on the aspect of extension ; the sesamoid bones serve to strengthen the articulations to which they are attached; they also increase the power of the muscles, by altering the direction of their ten- dons, and removing them further from the axis of the bone which they are intended to move.

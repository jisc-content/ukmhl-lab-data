59 median nerve, with the external cutaneous to its outer or humeral side, and with the ulnar and internal cuta- neous to .its inner or thoracic side, while posterior to it arc the musculo spiral and articular nerves. The lym- phatic glands are connected to the axillary vessels by the small branches which supply them : several lie pos- terior to the edge of the pectoral muscle; from these a Ciiain continues up to the coracoid process, and are continued beneath the clavicle and the glands in the neck; several also lie on the subscapular muscle, and some are scattered indifferently through this space. SECTION III, DISSECTION OF THE CAVITY OF THE THORAX. The thoiax is situated at the upper and anterior part ot the trunk; it contains the lungs, the organs of res- piration, the heart, the chief agent in the circulation of tne blood, also several nerves and vessels passing to and from the heart, and through the cavdy; this region is oounded anteriorly by the sternum and costal carti- ages, laterally by the ribs and intercostal muscles, pos- teriorly by the vertebree and angles of the ribs, inferi- orJy by the diaphragm, superinrlv by the several mu«- cles corinected to the clavicle, first rib and sternum, and by the difierent parts passing into or out of the cavitv Ihe tlmrax, viewed externally, presents a very different form before and after the upper extremities are de- tached from It; in the former state it appears of great Hransverse width above, and narrow below ; whereas in the latter condition, it is seen to be very contracted aoove and expanded below. The thorax may be com- pared to a section of a cone, the posterior fourth bein<j- removed, the three anterior parts retained and united to each other. The axis of the cavity is oblique from above dovvnwards and forwards ; the base of the thorax Is aUo oblique from before, backwards and downwards 4nd the apex on the contrary is oblique from behind,’

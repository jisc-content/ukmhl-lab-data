line of the frontal bone down to the nose. The Inmb- doid suture extends on either side from the posterior extremity of the sagittal suture, downwards and for- wards to the mastoid process of tlie temporal boiifr; a suture named the additanienlum of the lambdoid con- tinues down between this process and the occipital bone as far as the foramen lacerum posterius; the lambdoid suture is very rough and frequently contains ossa triquetra of very irregular size, it connects the oc- cipital and the two parietal bones; the additamentum is very little serrated, but presents uneven thick edges, it connects the occipital to the mastoid portion of the temporal bone, the mastoid'hole is frequently in it, it nearly corresponds to the lateral sinus. The squamous suture on each side is continued from the extremity of the sphenoidal in an arched direction upwards and backwards, as, far as the inferior angle of the parietal, it is then co.ntinued under the name of additamentum of the squamous suture, directly backwards for about an inch ; the structure of the squamous differs from that of the other sutures, the bones are not serrated but thin and scaly, fmd overlap each other, it unites the temporal to the parietal; the additamentum is serrated and connects the inferior angle of the parietal to the upper part of the mastoid portion of the temporal bone, it corresponds to the course of the lateral sinus inter- nally ; a small os triquetrum is sometimes found at the anterior part of this suture, and seldom in any other situation. OF THE SKULL IN GENERAL. The oM^er surface of the skull presents 4. regions, the superior is smooth and even, has no remarkable appeal - ance deserving more particular attention ; the lateral regions are each divided into two, anterior or temporal, and the posterior or mastoid ; the inferior region ex- tends from the nasal notch to the occipital protuberance, and is bounded laterally by the zygomatic arches, and by a ridge which is continued from these processes round the skull with but little interruption; this region may be divided into three portions, anterioi, middle, and posterior; the anterior extends from the superci-

Ihe student may ne.Kt examine the anatomy of the perilonaum; this is the largest serous sac or mem- brane in the body; it lines the abdominal muscles, and covers almost all the abdominal viscera ; that por- tion which adheres to the parietes is called the pa- and that covering the viscera the visceral layer. Ihe peritoneum is a shut sac, and therefore when opened presents one continued surface, ndiich may be traced throughout the whole extent without any inter- ruption ; It covers the viscera in such a manner as tliat they lie external or posterior to it; the flimiliar example ot the double night-cap on the head has been, not unaptly, adduced, to explain how the vis- cera may be covered by the peritonaeum, and yet really he beneath it or behind it. Let us now trace this membrane,through its entire extent, commencino- at the umbilicus; from the transverse incision that was made into it in this situation, we may perceive It to ascend on the internal surface of the transverse and recti muscles, as high as the margin of the tho- rax; then bending back, it adheres to the inferior surface of the diaphragm, and continues very far back dn-Mm'" particularly in the left hypochon- dnum, fiom the diaphragm it is reflected on the spleen on the left side, on the stomach in the centre on tlds last T- n this last named viscus by a distinct fold, the falci- frnm umbilicus, and from the abdominal muscles on the right side of the dianlir.^'* pemon^um is reflected from the p gm on each side of these organs in the epi- whfch^rf"'^ hypochondriac regions, it forms folds, I n hi ^ ligaments; these nat on^of H •‘'I- P^i-ticidarly in the exami- nation of the individual viscera.

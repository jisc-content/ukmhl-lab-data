cles, strengthens the inner side of the articulation, and guards against dislocation when the elbow is suddenly drawn backwards and outwards. This muscle can ab- duct the arm, draw it backwards, and rotate it inwards, so as to turn the palm of the hand backwards. These four capsular muscles, which have been just described, are of great use to the shoulder articulation ; the head of the humerus is so large, the glenoid cavity so superficial, and the capsular ligament so loose and long, that, but for these muscles, the bones could not remain in apposition ; hence, in cases of paralysis of the muscles of this region, the joint becomes elongated and flattened, and a partial dislocation exists : in the dissect- ing room also, if we divide all the muscles surrounding the capsule, and leave the latter uninjured, the bones will no longer be in contact: these muscles, therefore, serve to strengthen the capsule, to keep the head of the humerus pressed against the glenoid cavity, and thus to counteract that tendency to dislocate the head of the bone, which the larger muscles of the limb frequently have, in consequence of their insertion being at such a distance from the centre of the joint, added to the ana- tomical imperfections in the latter already alluded to ; which imperfections, hovvever, are much counter-ba- lanced by the great mobility which the joint enjoys in consequence of this formation, by the numerous oppos- ing muscles which serve to protect the articulation, and by the rotatory motion of which the scapula is alloM'Cd to partake. Teres Major, long and flat, arise from a rough, flat surface on the inferior angle of the scapula, below the infra-spinatus ; it forms a thick fleshy belly, which as- cends forwards and outwards to the inner side of the arm, and ends in a broad thin tendon, which is at first closely connected to the back of the tendon of the latis- simus dorsi; but near the humerus, a small bursa inter- venes, and is inserted into the inner or posterior edge of the bicipital groove, behind the tendon of the latissirnus, and in general, but not always, extending lower down than it. Use, to rotate the humerus inwards, and to draw it downwards and backwards; also to draw for-

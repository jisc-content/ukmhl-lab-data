386 SECTION III. ANATOMY OF THE LYMPHATIC SYSTEM. The lymphatic vessels have a great resemblance to veins, they are furnished with numerous valves, and arc arranged in two sets, a superficial and deep; both of these accompany the veins, that is, proceed from the extreme parts towards the centre, the greater number terminate in the thoracic duct, some however end in the veins on the right side, and recent obser- vations seem to prove, that in different situations the lymphatic and venous system are more closely allied than was foi merly believed ; the lymphatics are extremely minute, in some situations they cannot be demonstrated, as in the brain, in such probably the veins perform the additional office of absorption ; it is uncertain in what manner these vessels commence, whether by open mouths in the different structures, or whether they are fine returning arteries taking the same course as the veins, and only differing from the latter in their delicacy of size, in having more nu- merous valves, in not transmitting the coloured parti- cles of the blood, and in being connected with the lymphatic or conglobate glands. . The lymphatics of the lower extremities are super- ficial and deep, the first accompany the external and internal saphena veins; those which take the course of the external saphena, end in the popliteal glands, where they unite with the deep lymphatic vessels which take the course of the tibial and fibular veins and arteries; the lymphatics which accompany the internal saphena vein ascend to the groin, pass through the inguinal glands, and communicate not only with all the deep lymphatics of the limb, but also with the superficial vessels from the abdomen, pe- rinaeum, and genital organs ; the deep-seated lymphatics about the hip and the perinaum accompany the branches of the internal iliac artery and vein into the pelvis, where they pass through the pelvic lymphatic

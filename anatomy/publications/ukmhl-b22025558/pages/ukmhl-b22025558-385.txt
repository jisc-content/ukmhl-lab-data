375 The middle sacral arlery arises from the back part of the aorta a little above the bifurcation ; it descends nearly in the median line close to the sacrum, sends its branches to this bone, and communicates with the la- teral sacral arteries. The common iliac arteries descend obliquely outwards as far as the ilio-sacral articulations, opposite which each divides into the internal and external iliac; the right iliac is longer than the left, and passes over the commencement of the vena cava. The internal iliac ov hijpogastric artery p?i5ses down- wards and forwards into the pelvis to the side and back part of the bladder, where it ends in a ligamentous substance, which ascends first along the side of the bladder, and then behind the recti muscles as far as the umbilicus; the internal iliac artery gives off the follow- ing branches, ilio-lumbar, lateral sacral, haemorrhoidal, vesical, uterine and vaginal, the gluteal, sciatic, obtu-' rator, and pudic. 1st, The ilio-lumbar arises from the back part of the internal iliac, passes outwards behind the external iliac vessels and the psoas muscle, into the substance of the iliacus internus, in which it divides into ascending and descending branches. 2nd, The lateral sacral descends obliquely inwards in front of the sacral holes, through which it sends branches to the spi- nal nerves, also to the pyriform muscle, and to com- municate with the middle sacral. 3rd, The hcemorrlioi- dal are two or three branches of uncertain origin, they pass to the sides of the rectum and communicate with the superior and inferior haemorrhoidal arteries. 4th, The vesical arteries arise from the iliac, or from some of its branches; they ramify on the coats of the blad- der; the inferior also supply the parts about the neck of this organ. 5th, The uterine and vaginal arteries either arise from the internal iliac or from some of its branches, and are distributed as their names imply. 6th, The glutceal artery passes backwards and outwards from the pelvis by the upper part of the sciatic notch, above the pyriform muscle, and divides into several branches, some of which supply the glutteus maximus, others pass forwards in a semicircular course towards the spine of the ilium, and supply the glutacus medius

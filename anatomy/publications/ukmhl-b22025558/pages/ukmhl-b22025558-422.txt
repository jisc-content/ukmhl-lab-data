412 spine for the attachment of the recti muscles; the spi- nal hole is very large and divided into two by the trans- verse ligament, which arises from two tubercles placed on the inner side of the superior articulating processes ; the anterior portion, small, receives the tooth-like process of the 2nd vertebra, the posterior forms the spinal canal, the lamince are thick and round behind, but, near the articulating processes, are grooved above for the verte- bral artery, and below for the 2nd spinal nerve; before these notches are the articular processes, the superior horizontal, concave, oval from before backwards, look upwards and inwards, and receive the occipital con- dyles ; the inferior are nearly flat, circular, and inclined a little inwards; i\\Q transverse processes are long, and end in an obtuse point, the anterior root is slender, the posterior is long and large, the hole between these is larger than in the other vertebrae, and is directed up- wards and backwards ; from this a groove for the verte- bral artery wdnds backw'ards round the superior articu- lar process. In the adult the atlas is very compact; in the foetus its ossification takes place from five points, one for the anterior arch, two for the posterior, and one for each lateral part. The axis or 2d vertebra is remarkable for the length of its body, which has anteriorly a central ridge between tw'o depressions for muscles, and from its upper part there rises by a sort of a neck, a large, round, dentiform {odontoid) process, the forepart of which is received into the small articulating cavity on the anterior arch ot the atlas, while posteriorly it presents a small, smooth convexity, which moves against the smooth surface ol the transverse ligament of the atlas; the apex is rather pointed, to it and to the sides of this process the lateral or check ligaments are attached; the lamince very strong; the superior notches are behind, the interior before the articular processes; the spinal hole is large and heart-shaped; the spinous process is.forked and very strong, its under surface is channelled; the superior oblique processes are slightly convex, nearly horizontal, and look a little outwards; the inferior are smaller, fiat, and look downwards and forwards; the transverse pro- cesses are short, arise from the outside ot the superior

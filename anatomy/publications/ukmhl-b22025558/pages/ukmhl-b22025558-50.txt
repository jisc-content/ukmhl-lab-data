40 pel ioi and middle constrictors, and is inserted partly along with the latter and partly into the cornu of the thyroid cartilage. Use, to elevate and dilate the pharynx, in order to receive the food from the tongue; divide the stylo-pharyngeus, and the superior constrictor will be exposed. Constrictor Pharyngis Superior, surrounds the superior part of the pharynx; arises by a dense apo- neurosis from the petrous bone, which soon becomes connected with the next origin, which is fleshy, from the lower part of the internal pterygoid plate and ha- mular process, also from the intermaxillary ligament which connects it to the buccinator muscle, from the posterior third of the mylo-hyoid ridge, and from the side of the base of the longue; all the fibres take a semicircular course backwards and inwards, and are inserted into the cuneiform process and into the mid- dle tendinous line on the back of the pharynx. The superior constrictor is covered hy the styloid muscles and by the great vessels and nerves, and inferiorly by the middle constrictor, from which the stylo-pharyn- geus and glosso-pharyngeal nerve separate it: between the attachment to the petrous bone and that to the occi- pital, the raucous membrane is uncovered by muscular fibres in a small semicircular space, named sinus of Morgagni; this is beneath the cuneiform process, on each side of the middle line, and corresponds to the Eustachian tubes; between the temporal and pterygoid attachments, the muscles of the velum lie, and between the pterygoid and maxillary origins the internal ptery- goid muscle and the gustatory nerve are situated. Use, the constrictors diminish the capacity of the pharynx, and by the successive contractions of each, the food is forced into the oesophagus; the complex muscular structure of the pharynx may also assist in the modu- lation of the voice and in the production of certain sounds. Open the pharynx by a perpendicular incision through the middle tendinous line; on looking into the cavity it will be found divided by the velum into two por- tions, a superior and inferior: seven openings also may be remarked leading from it in different directions, viz. in the upper or nasal portion there are the two posterior

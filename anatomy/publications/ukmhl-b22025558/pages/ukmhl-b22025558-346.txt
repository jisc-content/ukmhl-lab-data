336 tic are five on each side, sometimes only four or three ; * they are situated on the anterior and lateral parts of the bodies of the vertebrae internal to the psoas, of an oval figure, smaller than the cervical; each ganglion is connected by one or two communicating branches which pass through the psoas to the anterior branches of the lumbar spinal nerves ; from the fore-part of each several filaments pass in front of the aorta and assist in the formation of the different abdominal plexuses which are principally derived from the solar plexus. The sacral ganglions are three or four in number; the first is oval, the remaining are of an irregular form; they each communicate with the sacral nerves and send filaments to the hypogastric and pelvic plexuses; from the last ganglion on each side a small branch passes inwards in front of the coccyx ; these branches unite in the middle line and form a small plexus, sometimes a distinct ganglion is placed here; from the convexity of the arch which these branches form, filaments pass off to the cocygaeus, levator, and sphincter ani muscles.

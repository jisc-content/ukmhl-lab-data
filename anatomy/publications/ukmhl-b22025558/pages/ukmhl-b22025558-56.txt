4G to the epiglottis by the aryteno-epiglottidean folds of mucous membrane, which folds form the sides of the glottis, and inferiorly to the angle of the thyroid by two ligaments on each side, csWeiithyro-arylenoid, or chordcB vocales; these arise from a sharp projection on the fore part of the baise of each arytenoid, pass forwards converging, and are inserted into the angle of the thyroid; the inferior is tendinous and liorizontal, the superior membranous and semilunar ; the narrow pas- sage between these ligaments of opposite sides is called the rima gloUidis; between the superior and inferior ligament of each side is a semilunar fossa called the sinus or ventricle of the larynx. The eyi- glottis, or fibro-cartilage, is anterior to the glottis; it is somewhat of an oval form, connected inferiorly by a stalk-like process to the angle of the thyroid ; anteriorly by cellular membrane and by the epiglottidean gland to the os hyoides, also to the tongue by three folds of mu- cous membrane, the central one of which is called the fraenum epiglottidis ; posteriorly to the arytenoid car- tilages by the folds of mucous membrane, which form the sides of the glottis. Tlie epiglottis stands nearly vertical; it is a little curved forwards at its upper bor- der and along its sides, so that its anterior suface is concave from above downwards, and convex trans- versely; and its posterior surface is concave from side to side, and convex from above downwards; it is very elastic, and never found ossified, a change which the cartilages of the larynx are prone to undergo : in de- glutition the epiglottis is of much use; it covers the larynx, and so prevents any foreign substance entering it; during this act the tongue is turned backwards, and the larynx raised forwards; thus the glottis is closed, and the contents of the mouth pass over the epiglottis into the pharynx. The larynx is lined by mucous membrane, which passing from the tongue and pharynx, covers the epiglottis and arytenoid cartilages, forms their connecting folds, descends into the larynx, covers the chordae vocales, lines the ventricles of the larynx, and is continued down through the trachea and the brandies of that tube ; it is but loosely connected to the cartilages above at the glottis, but more closely below; several mucous glands are connected to it, thus in the

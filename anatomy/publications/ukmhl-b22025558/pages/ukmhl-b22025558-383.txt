373 merous branches, and inosculates with the gastro*- epiploica sinistra, a branch of the splenic artery ; the right and left hepatic arteries then separate and plunge into the substance of the liver, accompanying the branches of the vena porta: the right hepatic is the larger, and before it enters the gland it gives off the cystic artery which supplies the parietes of the gall- bladder; 3rd, the splenic artery the longest brancli of the cceliac axis ; it passes backwards and to the left side along the upper edge of the pancreas, to which it sends several branches; near the spleen it gives off the gastro-epiploica sinisti'a; this bends forwards, and to the right side along the great curvature of the stomach, and between the laminte of the great omentum, it inos- culates with the corresponding branch from the hepatic artery ; the splenic next sends off the vasa brevia, five or six small branches which pass to the great end of the stomach, and inosculate with the proper gastric arteries; the splenic artery then divides into several branches, which enter the foramina on the concavesurface of the spleen, and ramify through its spongy substance. The superior mesenteric artery arises a little below the cceliac, descends obliquely forwards and to the left behind the pancreas, and over the duodenum; it then passes between the layers of the mesentery and takes an arched course towards the right iliac fossa ; from its concave side arise three branches, the ileo-colic, ri^ht colic, and middle colic; these three branches proceed between the laminae of the raeso-colon to the large in- testine, each divides into two branches, which unite with those on either side, and form arches, from the convexities of which branches arise, some of which subdivide and unite again in the same manner as the first branches; near the intestine straight branches pro-, ceed on the anterior and posterior surface, and supply the muscular and mucous coats; from the convex side of the mesenteric artery 18 or 20 branches arise, these proceed between the laminte of the mesentery, divide, and form arches, from which new branches arise, these again divide, and again unite in an arched manner; these divisions and subsequent inosculations occur three or four times before the arteries arrive at the in- K K

45 the body, a small process, the appendix ascends ob- liquely backwards, and gives attachment to the stylo- hyoid ligament and muscle. Use, to serve as a fixed point for the muscles of the tongue, pharynx and larynx. Four cartilages enter into the formation of the ske- leton of the larynx, the thyroid, cricoid and two aryte- noid, and one fibro-cartilage, the epiglottis. The thy- roid-cartilage is placed at the anterior and lateral parts of the larynx; it presents, anteriorly, a prominence, named, in the male subject, the poniim Adami, late- rally the ales, each of which in passing backwards, in- creases in depth, and presents an oblique ridge for the attachment of the sterno-thyroid, and thyro-hyoid mus- cles ; a hole is frequentlj'^ observed in each ala near this ridge; posteriorly the alae terminate round and thick, and from their upper and lower extremity send oft' the processes called cornua; the ascending cornua arc con- nected to the cornua of the os hyoides by round liga- ments, which are often cartilaginous, and even bony ; the inferior cornua are shorter, and are attached by synovial membranes and capsular ligaments to the sides of the cricoid cartilage ; the anterior angle of the thy- roid is connected superiorly to the body of the os hyoi- des by a thin membrane, anterior hyo-thyroid ligament, and inferiorly to the cricoid cartilage by a strong elastic ligament, crico-thyroid.—The cricoid, or annular carti- lage, forms the lower part of the larynx, is narrow be- fore, deep behind ; the inferior edge or circumference is nearly horizontal; the superior is oblique, leading from above and from behind, downwards and forwards ; on its posterior surface is a middle prominent ridge, on each side of which is a depression, filled by the poste- rior crico-arytenoid muscle; at the upper and back part on each side is a smootli articulating convex surface, on which the arytenoid cartilage moves.—The arytenoid cartilages are triangular, the base below moving on the cricoid, the apex above inclining a little backwards, and surmounted by a small process, the up'pendix; the inter- nal, or opposed side of each cartilage is flat, the exter- nal is rough for the insertion of muscles, the posterior sur- face of each is concave, and covered by the arytenoid mu-cle ; the anterior is sharp, and connected superiorly

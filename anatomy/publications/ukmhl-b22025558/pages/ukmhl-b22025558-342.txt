332 external join the superior cervical nerves, and the ante- rior unite with branches of the vagus and the facial, and form a plexus around the carotid artery ; from this se- veral branches extend along the external carotid, and form plexuses around each of-its principal branches, which are named accordingly. The middle cervical aangUon is sometimes wanting; it is smaller than the superior, of a triangular, often an irregular form, is situated behind the carotid near the curve of the infe- rior thyroid artery, opposite the fifth vertebra, and upon the longus colli muscle ; it sends off branches in different directions which communicate with the cervi- cal nerves and with the vagus: it also sends some fila- ments to join the cardiac nerves. The injerior cervical ganglion is of an irregular figure; it frequently appears to consist of several small ganglions connected to each other by reddish filaments; it is situated between the transverse process of the last cervical veitebia and the neck of the first rib, behind and.on either side of the vertebral artery, and between the scalenus and longus colli muscles ; filaments from it communicate with the phrenic nerve and with the brachial plexus ; several also encircle the subclavian artery and extend along that trunk and its several branches, particularly along the vertebral artery; from it also the inferior cardiac nerves proceed. The student may next examine the cardiac nerves ; there are three on each side, they are named superior, middle, and inferior ; the superior car- diac nerve, though very small, takes a long course ; it arises by two or three filaments from the superior cer- vical ganglion, descends along the side of the traciea behind the carotid artery to the chest; m this course it communicates with the laryngeal nerves, with the va- gus, and with the inferior and middle ganglions of the sympathetic ; there is sometimes a small ganglion upon it near the inferior thyroid artery ; at the lower part of the neck it passes behind the subclavian vein and over the arteria innominata; it here divides into several fila- Lnts; some pass along the coats | aorta, others join the recurrent nerve â€˜he middle and inferior cardiac nerves ; the superior cardiac e on the left side has a similar origin and course in the

413 articular processes, are bent downwards, and are not oihd ; the hole is directed obliquely upwards and out- wards. This vertebra in the fcetus has an additional point of ossification in the odontoid process. It is ar- ticulated directly with the atlas and the 3rd vertebra and indirectly with the occipital bone. The ie-centh cervical vertebra is large, its spine is very prominent, and not bifid ; its transverse process is seldom perforated, as in the other cervical vertebrm • when there is a foramen in it, it transmits the vertebral vein and not the artery; in this vertebra an additional point or ossification is found in the pedicle which con- nects the processes to the body; this sometimes in- creases beyond the transverse process, so as to resemble a supernumerary or a cervical rib. The length ot the vertebral column is generally about a third of that of the whole body ; the lumbar and cervical regions are nearly equal, and each about half of the dorsal, the latter commonly measures inches, and each of the former about 6. Its general torm 13 that of a pyramid, the base below; but wlien accurately examined it will be found to represent three pyramids; the first has its apex in the third cervical vertebra, surmounted by the axis and atlas, and its base ij. in the first dorsal, which is also the base of the se- cond pyramid whose apex is in the fifth dorsal, where a so IS the apex of the third pyramid, whose base is at the sacruin ; the vertebrae diminishing in size about the 4th and oth dorsal. The column is convex anteriorly in the neck, concave in the back, and convex in the oin, ; these curvatures are caused by the different thickness of the bodies of the vertebrm before and be- hind, and of the intervertebral ligaments in these three situations A perpendicular line passed through the centre of the apex and base of the column will be found nterior to the dorsal, and posterior to the cervical and umbar vertebrae. In the dorsal region there is gene- tn 1 which is usually concave the lek side ; this direction of this curve has been y some ascribed to the pressure of the aorta on the left •de, by others, and with more probability, to the effect of muscular action, for as the muscles of the ri-du arm N N 2 °

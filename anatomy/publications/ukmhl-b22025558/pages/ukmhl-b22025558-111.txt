101 afterwards of the biceps ; near the elbow it inclines for- wards, and then sinks beneath the fascia of the biceps, and a little below the bend of the elbow it divides into the radial and ulnar arteries. In this course it is co- vered by the fascia and integuments, and overlapped a little bj^ the biceps; it is surrounded by a sheath of cel- lular membrane, which also contains the two venae comites ; the internal cutaneous nerve lies superficial to it; the median or brachial is also superficial to it above, and rather to its outer side, about the middle of the arm, it crosses the artery, and inferiorly it is almost always to its ulnar or inner side. The ulnar nerve lies internal to the artery, and at some distance from it in- teriorly; the radial or spiral nerve is posterior to it, and separates it above from the triceps. In this course the artery passes over the tendons of the latissimus and teres, a small part of the triceps, the coraco-brachialis, and the brachiasus anticus. The brachial artery gives off several muscular branches from its external side; and from its internal, the superior profunda, which ac- companies the spiral nerve round the back of the hu- merus to its external side; tlie inferior profunda whicli descends along with the ulnar nerve towards the inner condyle, and the anastomotica magna, which runs to- wards the inner side of the elbow joint.â€”See Anatomy of the Vascular System. The branches of the brachial plexus of nerves, which are met with in the dissection of the arm, are six in number: 1st, the internal cutaneous, which has been already noticed; 2d, the external cutaneous, or mus- culo cutaneous, or perforans casserii, pierces the coraco- brachialis muscle, descends obliquely outwards between the biceps and brachialis anticus, to which it sends se- veral filaments, and at the anterior edge of the supinator longus it becomes cutaneous, descending along with the cephalic vein and its branches; 3d, the median or bra- chial nerve accompanies the brachial artery to the bend of the elbow, and sinks beneath the muscles of the forearm, in the dissection of which the remainder of its course will be exposed ; 4th, the ulnar nerve descends along the inner portion of the triceps, or the brachimus internus, runs behind the inner condyle, and is then K 2

452 beneath the alveoli, with each of which it communicates; it contains the dental nerve and vessels; below the inci- sors this canal turns back a little and ends at the men- tal hole ; this canal is nearer the inner surface of the jaw behind, and the outer surface before; the ramus «nds above in a notch and two processes, the anterior or coronoid, the posterior or condyloid; the notch is traversed by the masseter nerve and vessels. The coro- ^widprocess \s triangular, the apex is inclined a little t3utwards, it is embraced by the insertion of the tempo- ral muscle. The condyle is an oblong convex process supported by a neck which is most depressed anteriorly, for the insertion of the external pterygoid muscle ; the ■condyle is curved forwards and most convex in that di- direction ; it is directed obliquely backwards and in- v'ards, so that its internal extremity is posterior, it is also higher than the external; its posterior surface is nearly straight and almost free from cartilage. By these })rocesses the lower maxilla is articulated with the tem- poral bones ; on the external edge of each is a tubercle for the insertion of the external lateral ligament. The lower jaw in the young subject always consists of two symmetrical pieces. The Teeth are small, hard bones, 32 in number, 16 in each jaw ; their form is generally conical the apex in the aveoli; in each tooth we distinguish the crown, neck, and root; i\\e croton is external to the alveolus, it has no periosteum, but is covered by a firm w'hite vitre- ous substance, named enamel: the neck is surrounded by the gum, and the root is firmly held in the alveolus by a mode of connexion called gomphosis. The teeth are divided into three classes, the incisores, the canini and the molares: the incisores are four in each jaw, the crovni of these is sharp, and wedge-shaped, convex before and thickly covered with enamel; those in the upper are stronger than those in the lower jaw; the former are broader, their edge is like a chisel, cut off posteriorly, the latter are more vertical, their anterior surface is bevelled oft, but they are not so sharp as those in the upper jaw, their roots are larger; the canine teeth or cuspidali are 2 in each jaw, the crown is conical, a little blunt, convex before, their root is single

Optic Nerves: each optic nerve, on passing tl)iough the optic foramen, becomes surrounded by a strong sheath derived from tlie dura mater ; the four lecti muscles next surround it, from the fleshy portions ^ separated by a considerable quantity of soft tat, m which several nerves and vessels are lod<^ed ; from the optic foramen this nerve proceeds forv°ards and a little inwards, so as to be slightly curved, the convexity outwards; at the back part of the eye it is very much constricted; it then pierces the Sclerotic and choroid membranes and terminates m the retina.— (bee Anatomy of the Eye.) The ophthalmic artery accompanies this nerve, in the optic foramen it lies beneath it, it afterwards twines around it to its internal side. In addition to the dura mater, this nerve possesses a very dense neurilema which sends in numerous pro- cesses to form small canals or tubes in which the ner- vous substance is contained, so that this nerve is not composed like other nerves, of several filaments placed paiallel to each other; if the white substance be re- moved by maceration in an alkali, its cellular struc- ture will become obvious. At the side of the body of the sphenoid bone, the following four nerves of the orbit lie according to their numerical order, viz. most superiorly the third pair, then the fourth, next the ophthalmic branch of the fifth pair, and most inferiorly the sixth or abducens nerve- they are here closely united to each other, forminfr 'viat may be termed the orbital jilexus, until they arrive at the anterior clinoid process, where they separate, and as they are entering the foramen lacerum orbitale they lie thus; most superior is the fourth, then the frontal branch of ophthalmic, next the superior division of the tlnrd, external to which, and near to the outer wall of the oroit, is lachyrmal nerve of the ophthalmic after these the nasal nerve, below which is the inferior division of the third, and lastly lying inferior to them all, liolding the same relation to them as at the caver- nous sinus, is the sixth nerve. lo expose these four nerves the orbit should be

231 by a considerable depth of fat, and by a thin fascia; us the latter approaches the upper edge of the muscle, it becomes more strong and adherent, and is thence extended over the anterior part of the gluta;u3 medius, to which it adheres very closely, and is then inserted into the crest and anterior spine the ilium. The glu- tasus maximus covers all the muscles on the posterior part of the pelvis, except the anterior portion of the glutEEus medins, which is covered by the fascia just now mentioned ; its insertion into the linea aspera is above the short heachof the biceps, and between the vastus externus and adductor magnus; a very large bursa lines its tendon, and is expanded over the trochanter and a portion of the vastus externus ; it is very thin, it usu- ally contains much synovial fluid, and it is frequently intersected by tendinous bands ; a smaller bursa is of- ten situated below it, between the tendons of the glu- taeus maximus and vastus externus. Divide this muscle by a perpendicular incision, and separate the edges; several muscles, vessels, &c. may be noticed,having tliefollov/ing relation to each other: commencing above, we see the glutseus medius muscle, beneath this, the pyriformis, and between these, the glutseal vessels and the superior glutacal nerve; below the pyriform muscle we remark the great sciatic and some smaller nerves, also the sciatic and pudic vessels, all escaping from the pelvis by the lower part of the sciatic notch ; next in order are the gemini muscles surrounding the tendon of the obturator internus, be- low these is the quadratus femoris, parallel to the su- perior fibres of the adductor magnus ; the great sciatic ligament, the tuber ischii, and the superior attachment of the hamstring muscles are seen in this dissection, also several small arteries and veins, and a considerable quantity of loose watery cellular tissue, which surrounds the sciatic nerve in its course through the depression between the trochanter and tuber ischii. Glut.eus Medius, triangular, flat, thinner than the last described muscle is exposed by dividing the glu- taeus maximus and dissecting off the strong fascia which extends from its anterior edge to the crest of the ilium, arises by fleshy and aponeurotic fibres from the dee[>

341 roof of the cavity may be broken or cut through at the lower and internal part of the squamous plate ; this ca- vity is placed between the meatus externus and the la- byrinth; it is of an irregular figure, rather circular ; it presents on its internal side a tubercular eminence, named the j)7-omontory, and two foramina, one above, the other below that eminence ; the superior foramen, or fenestra avails, is closed by a membrane, to which the base of the stapes bone is attached, this opening communicates with the vestibule; the inferior or the foramen rotundum is also closed by a membrane, it communicates with the internal part of the cochlea or the scala tympani; the posterior wall of the tympanum presents superiorly the opening of a short canal, which leads to the mastoid cells, these are of irregular form and differ in different subjects; beneath this is the ramid, a small bony projection, hollow, containing the muscle of the stapes; beneath the pyramid is the small foramen leading Ifom the aqueduct of Fallopius, and transmitting the corda tympani. The tympanum pre- sents anteriorly the openings of two canals, one supe- rior containing the tensor tympani muscle, the other, the inferior, is the Eustachian tube ; this descends ob- liquely forwards and inwards, and terminates by a trum- pet-shaped mouth, behind the posterior nares, on a le- vel with the inferior spongy bone; this canal is small, and osseous posteriorly, anteriorly it is large and formed of membrane externally, and of a curved fibro-carti- lage internally; it is lined by mucous membrane, which is prolonged from the pharynx into the tympa- num; through this tube the atmosphere can pass from the fauceis into the tympanum, to support the latter on its internal surface. In the superior boundary of the tympanum are some- small foramina for the ))assage of blood-vessels ; its inferior boundary presents the glenoid fissure, through which pass the corda tympani, the ten- don of the laxator tympani, and the processus gracilis of the malleus. Within the cavity of the tympanum are four small bones, first the malleus, attached to the membrar.a tympani, and resting on the second, the in- cus, one leg of which is connected to the third, the or- bicular, which is articulated to the fourth, the stapes^ G G 2

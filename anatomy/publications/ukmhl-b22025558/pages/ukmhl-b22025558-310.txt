300 plate of the os frontis by two cuts with the saw, these should unite in the optic formen ; the internal is to be carried forward to the superciliary arch about half an inch external to the internal angular process; the»ex- ternal incision is to be carried deeply through the ma- lar bone ; a slight blow with the hammer will then throw forwards the roof of the orbit, and the bone will sepa- rate easily from the periosteum. The THIRD PAIR, or motores oculorum, in passing through the foramen lacerum orbitale, divide into two branches, a superior and inferior: the superior, or the smaller, passes between the heads of the external rectus Auscle and over the optic and nasal nerves, and divides into two branches, the smaller and shorter one ot which supplies the superior rectus, the other the levator pal- pebi-ffi muscle. The inferior or the larger branch passes below and to the outside of the optic nerve and divides into three branches, an internal, middle, and external; the internal is the largest, it passes obliquely down- wards, forwards, and inwards, beneath the optic nerve, and getting to its internal side is distributed to the internal rectus, the middle to the inferior rectus; and the external, which is the longest, passes down- wards and forwards on the surface of the inferior rec- tus, between it and the globe of the eye, (it gives no filaments to this muscle,) and is lost in the interior ob- lique muscle ; this last branch gives oft’ from its root a small short filament to the ophthalmic ganglion. All the branches of the third pair are distributed to the ocular surface of the muscles. The Trochleator, or fourth nerve, having entered the orbit by the foramen lacerum, ascends obliquely forwards and inwards above the levator palpebrae and the superior rectus, and is distributed by four or five fine branches to the upper surface ot the superior ob- lique muscle; as this delicate nerve is passing along the outer side of the cavernous sinus, it lies between the third pair and the ophthalmic branch ot the fifth, below the former and above the latter and the sixth ; as it enters the orbit it mounts above the third and fifth, and is therefore the highest nerve m the orjit,

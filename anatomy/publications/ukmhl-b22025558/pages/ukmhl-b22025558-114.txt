101< palmar Jascia : this is of a triangular form, commences narrow at the annular ligament, from which, and from the tendon of the palmaris longus, it arises; it then ex- pands oyer the palm of the hand, and near the fingers divides into four fasciculi, each of which is forked and inserted into either side of each of the sheaths of the flexor tendons, and into the capsular ligaments of the first phalanges; transverse bands pass across these di- verging fasciculi, and several fibres penetrate between the tendons, and join the metacarpal bones and inter- osseous muscles; a thin aponeurosis, derived from the outer edge of the palmar fascia, covers the muscles of the thumb, and a similar one, those of the little finger. Attached to the palmar fascia is the following small cutaneous muscle : Palmaris Brevis, arises from the annular ligament and palmar fascia ; the fibres pass transversely inwards, and are inserted into the integuments on the inner side of the palm of the hand. Use, to deepen the hollow of the palm of the hand by drawing the integuments to- wards the thumb. We may now dissect off the fascia of the hand and forearm, to expose the muscles; in some situations it is difficult and unnecessary to sepa- rate this from the muscular fibres; beneath the palmar fascia we expose the superficial palmar arch of vessels and nerves passing across the flexor tendons and the lumbricales muscles. The muscles of the forearm are so very numerous, that it will be found convenient to class them according to their situation and their use. One set of these mus- cles is employed in bending the forearm, wrist, and fin- gers; these are the flexors: a second, nearly allied to these, have the power of pronating the hand, that is, of rolling the radius across the ulna, so as to make the palm of the hand look downwards; these are the prona- tors ; a third set, the extensors, can extend the forearm, hand, and fingers ; and a fourth, allied to these, the su- pinators, can turn the hand supine; that is, place the radius and ulna on the same plane, and make the palm of the hand look upwards. The pronators and flexors arise chiefly from the internal condyle, and from the inner or ulnar side of the forearm ; each of these two

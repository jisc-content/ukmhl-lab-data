62 mediastinum, and arriving at the forepart of the peri- cardium is continued along the side of that bag as far back as tlie root of the lung, whence it is reflected over the anterior surface of this organ, sinking into its fis- sures, and connecting all its lobules to each other; hav- ing thus invested the whole lung, it arrives at the pos- terior surface of its root, from which it is reflected to the back part of the pericardium, where it approaches the opposite pleura, to which it is connected by cellular membrane ; thence it passes to the sides of the verte- brae, thus forming the side of the posterior mediasti- num (to be examined presently;) the pleura then ex- pands along the side of the spine, ascending as high as the transverse process of the 6th or 7th cervical verte- bra, and descending to the diaphragm, the convex sur- face of which it covers ; on this muscle also it is re- flected from the lower edge of the root ot the lung by a fold called ligamentum latum 'pulmonis, loose and tri- angular, the base towards the diaphragm, one side con- nected to the lung, and the opposite to the mediasti- num ; from the vertebrae, the pleura continues to pass outwards, lining the ribs and intercostal muscles, as far forwards as the side of the sternum, where the sac was opened, and the description commenced. The pleurae are of a conical form, the apex of each is in the neck, covered by the anterior scalenus and subclavian arterjâ€™, the base adheres to the diaphragm ; the right pleura is shorter but broader than the left, which is long and narrow ; the liver on the right side and the heart on the left, cause these differences to exist; the apex of the right is often higher in the neck than that of the left. The two pleurae have been resembled to two bladders placed nearly parallel to each other, not having any communication, but touching each other along the me- sial line; this juxta-position of the tw'O pleurae between the sternum and vertebrae forms a sort ot paitition be- tween the right and left sides of the thoiax; this par- n tition is called mediastinum; it consists of course of two laminae, right and left, connected anteriorly to the sternum, posteriorly to the spine ; these laminae are se- parated from each other in three situations, in order to tuiclose certain organs, so that the mediastinum is di-

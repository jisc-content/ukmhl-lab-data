20G nued irom that covering the prostate gland. Each ve- sicula consists of two tunics, viz. mucous membrane internally, and peculiar grey substance externall}% somewhat similar to, but softer than the outer coat of the vas deferens. The vas deferens communicates more freely with the corresponding vesicula than the latter does with the former, hence air or fluid in- iected into the vas deferens will generally distend the vesicula seminalis of the same side before it escapes into the urethra. These organs are generally believed to contribute some additional secretion to the seminal fluid, rather than to serve as reservoirs for the latter ; their exact use, however, is not well known; they are wanting in many animals. The Prostate gland is situ- ated at the anterior and inferior part of the pelvis, be- hind the triangular ligament, in front of the rectum, to which it is connected by cellular membrane; it sur- rounds the neck of the bladder, and is attached by the anterior ligaments of this organ to the lower edge of the symphysis pubis, from which it is about three-fourths of an inch distant. The prostate gland is somewhat heart-shaped, or triangular; it is also compared to a chesnut; the base or larger extremity is posterior, and connected to the vesiculse seminales ; the apex is ante- rior, and extends within a short distance of the trian- gular ligament; the neck ot the bladder, and about an inch of the urethra, run through its substance, but a small portion of it lies superior to the neck of the blad- der and urethra ; this part is convex, and is covered by the dorsal veins of the penis, and by the anterior liga- ments of the bladder ; the inferior or posterior surface of the gland is almost flat, a slight groove is generally observable on it, extending along the mesial line ; this surface is attached to the fore-part of the rectum, and may be felt distinctly cither in the living or in the dead subject by the finger introduced into the intestine about two inches and a half above the anus ; the sides of the gland are smooth and round, and are covered by a strong fascia, by several veins, and by the levatores- am muscfes. In the base or posterior end is a notch or the entrance of the common ejaculatory ducts ; tins notch, together with the groove on the posterior sur-

150 surface or cavity for the stomach to move or to distend into posteriorly daring the process of digestion. The splenic omentum extends from the fissure in the spleen to the great end of the stomach, and is continu- ous inferiorly with the great omentum ; the splenic ves- sels and the vasa brevia are contained between the la- minae of this process. The colic omentum is a fold of peritonaeum which descends from the upper part of the right or ascending colon ; it generally lies posterior to the great omentum ; it is composed ot two laminae, between which are con- tained blood-vessels and adipose substance. The appendices epiploicce are attached all along the large intestine ; but principally to the transverse aich of the colon ; they are small prolongations of the peiito- n^um, filled with a soft tatty substance ; they are never found attached to the small intestine; they vary very much in different subjects in number and size; their use is not ascertained. The mesentery is the largest and most remaikab e process of the peritonaeum; it is continuous with the descending layer of the meso-colon, and extends from the left side of the second lumbar vertebra obliquely downwards to the right iliac fossa; this is the root of the mesentery ; from this it expands very much, and is folded round the jejunum and ileum intestines, and then returns again to the spine or to the interior surface ot the root; the laminae of the mesentery can be easily separated; between them we find the mesenteric arte- rie^s veins and nerves, also numerous absorbent vessels andâ€™ glands ; the mesentery serves to support the con- volutions of the small intestines and the numerous ves- sels nassing to and from these. _ The meso-ccecum is a fold of peritonaeum which at- taches the caecum to the right iliac fossa; this procees, howe^ frequently imperfect; the posterior portion of this intestine being sometimes deprived of a serous coat, and connected to the iliac muscle by cellular mem- The meso-rectum is a short fold of peritonaeum which connects the superior portion ot the rectum ^ and anterior part of the sacrum; it encloses the haemo hoidal vessels and nerves.

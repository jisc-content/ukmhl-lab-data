The bodies of the vertebrae are united by an ante- rior, a posterior, and inter-vertebral ligaments. The Anterior Vertebral Lis^ment is a strong band of fibres extending from the axis to the sacrum, and adhering to the bones and inter-vertebral substances : beneath this band other fibres are seen crossing ob- liquely between the bodies of the vertebra?. This li- gament is narrow in the cervical and lumbar regions, broader and more distinct in the dorsal; it consists of three planes of fibres, viz. the superficial extend over four or five vertebrae; the middle over two or three, and the third only cover a single vertebra. The Posterior Vertebral Ligament extends down the back part of the bodies of the vertebrae, along the front of the spinal canal; it consists of smooth glistening fibres; it is narrow' in the dorsal, and broad in the lumbar and cervical regions. The Inter-vertebral Ligaments orjibro-cartilages are placed between the bodies of all the vertebrae, except between the atlas and dentata. They are united very firmly above and below to the flat surfaces of the vertebrae. In the neck and loins they are thicker in front than behind, the contrary in the back; they are formed of concentric layers of fibrous matter decussating each other, and having intervals between them, which are more considerable towards the cen- tre. These intervals are filled by a soft elastic pulpy tissue, w'hich is gradually increased in quantity to- wards the centre. The articulating processes of the vertebra? are con- nected by synovial membranes, and by ligamentous fibres extended irregularly between them. Between the back part of the plates of the verte- brae, are the ligamenta sub-flava. These ligaments close the intervals between the vertebrae, and thus corn- plete the back part of the spinal canal. They exist

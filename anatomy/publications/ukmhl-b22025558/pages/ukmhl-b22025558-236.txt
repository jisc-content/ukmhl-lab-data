226 and the gracilis, and above the adductor brevis; its in- sertion is behind the vastus internus, and in front of the adductor magnus; this adductor is covered by the integuments and fascia superiorly, and by the sartorius and tbe femoral vessels inferiorly; it lies anterior to the two following muscles. Adductor Brevis, short, flat, and triangular, is situated posterior to the adductor longus and peciinaeus, and internal to the psoas; arises flat and tendinous from the anterior inferior surface of the pubis, between the symphysis and the thyroid hole; it soon ends in a deshy belly, which passes outwards, backwards, and a little downwards, inserted by tendinous slips into the superior third of the internal root of the linea aspera, extending for about three inches below the lesser trochanter. The origin of this muscle is external to the gracilis, and concealed by the adductor longus and the pectinmus; as it descends it is covered by these muscles, except a small portion near its inserlion,whicli appears between them ; this portion is posterior to tlie femoral and profunda vessels; its insertion is anterior to that of the adductor magnus ; m the tendon of this adductor one or two large openings frequently exist tor the passage of some of the perforating arteries. Adductor Magnus, the longest and largest of the adductors, triangular, the base a'-tached to the femiir the apex to the pelvis; omes chiefly fleshy fiomte anterior surface of the descending ramus of the pub s, external to the gracilis, also from the ramus of he ischium, and tendinous from the external bordei of the tuberosity of the latter; the hbres pass outwards with different ^degrees of obliquity; those the pubis ascend obliquely outwards, those fiom the ZZs of the ischiun/pass outwards and downwards, and those from the tuber ischii more directly down- wards; inserted fleshy into the rough from the great trochanter to and fleshy into the linea aspera and by a long round Lndon into the internal condyle of the einur. The superior edge of this muscle has a twisted a^pemanc^^^^ it is nearly parallel to the quadralus femoiis, several branches of the internal circumflex vessels pass between

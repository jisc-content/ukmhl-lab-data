79 ments along the middle line, from the occiput to the sacrum; make a transverse incision from the last cervi- cal vertebra to the acromion, and another from the last dorsal vertebra to the posterior part of the axilla; re- flect the upper and lower flap of integument from the spine towards the side, and raise the middle portion from below upwards and inwards ; thus the dissector can most easily expose the trapezius and latissimus dorsi muscles; the integuments in this region are dense, also the subjacent cellular tissue, which seldom contains much adeps, inferiorly it is often anasarcous ; when all this is dissected from the posterior part of the trunk, we see exposed the trapezius superiorly, the latissimus dorsi inferiorly, and between these, in a small triangular space behind the base of the scapula, a part of the great rhom- boid, also two or three tendons of the sacro-lumbalis, and a portion of the 7th, 8th and 9th ribs, and of the corresponding intercostal muscles; along the middle line of the neck a strong ligament is observed, (ligamen- tum nuchae), at the lower part of which a strong apo- neurosis of an oval form, (the cervical aponeurosis) : also covering the lumbar region another still stronger is seen, (the lumbar fascia): to each of these the student should pay attention. The ligamentum nuchcB is inserted superiorly into the occipital protuberance, it descends in the median line, broad above, and sinking in deep, so as to form a septum between the muscles on the right and left sides, and is inserted inferiorly into the spinous pro- cesses of the three or four last cervical vertebrae, and into the cervical aponeurosis. Use, to support the head in flexion of the neck, and to give attachment to mus- cles. The cervical aponeurosis extends from the 5tli cervical to the 5tli dorsal vertebra, narrow at each extremity, and broad in the centre between the superior angles of the two scapulae ; the fibres are transverse, and continuous with the fibres of the trapezius on each side : it gives strength to these, and binds down the subjacent muscles. The lumbar fascia is of great strength ; it is also somewhat oval, attached by its inferior extremity to the spinous processes of the sacrum, and by its superior to those of the inferior dorsal vertebrae; on either side it is connected to the crest of the ilium, and to the abdo-

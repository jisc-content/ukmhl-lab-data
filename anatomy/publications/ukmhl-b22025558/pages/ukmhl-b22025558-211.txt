201 in the scrotum communicated with the general cavity of the peritonaeum by a sort of canal which led along the fore-part of the cord from the abdomen to the scro- tum : this canal, however, about the period of birth was closed by adhesive inflammation, and ever afterwards the cavity of the tunica vaginalis is quite distinct from that of the peritoneum. The tunica vaginalis, there- fore, is a serous membrane, a shut sac, suspending, and partly enclosing the testicle, and also reflected over its anterior part and sides: that portion of it which sus- pends the gland, and which lines the scrotum, may be named the tunica vaginalis scroti; while the reflected portion which covers the sides and fore-part of the tes- ticle is the tunica vaginalis testis. This membrane is so loosely connected to the scrotum that it can be de- tached from it with little force ; it is thence reflected on the side and fore-part of the epididymis and testis ; it also ascends a short distance on the fore-part of the cord; the posterior part of the epididymis is altoge- ther uncovered by it: as it is continued from the epididymis to the testicle it passes in between these organs, particularly on their outer side, so as to form a sort of pouch between them. Both the testicle and epididymis are in reality behind this serous membrane, and nothing is contained within its cavity except the serous fluid, which lubricates its opposed surfaces, and which facilitates that gliding motion which the testi- cle undergoes in the scrotum. When the anterior part of the tunica vaginalis is divided, we see its in- ternal surface smooth and polished, and shining through its reflected layer which covers the testis, we can dis- cern_ the next tunic of this gland, tunica albuginea: this is a dense fibrous membrane; it forms the proper capsule of the gland, adheres to it, preserves its pe- culiar form, and sends several processes or septa into the testicle, which will be seen when the body of the latter shall have been opened ; it has no connexion to the epididymis; it is difficult to dissect off the re- flected layer of the serous membrane, or the tunica vaginalis testis from the tunica albuginea they are so mtimately united; through the latter several blood- vessels can be distinctly seen. Each testicle is of an

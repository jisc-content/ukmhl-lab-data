298 CHAPTER III. DISSECTION OF THE NERVES. The course and ultimate distribution of most of the nerves have been already mentioned in the description of the muscles and of the several regions of the body ; in the present chapter they shall be considered in a sys- tematic manner, commencing with the cerebral nerves, the origins of which have been already described. SECTION I. DISSECTION OF THE CEREBRAL NERVES. Olfactory nerves; from the bulb, which each of these nerves forms at the side of the crista galli, several branches descend into the nose, through the foramen in the cribriform plate ; they may be divided into the internal, middle, and external. The internal branches, about ten in number, descend in grooves along the sep- tum, subdivide into many filaments which form a plexus with each other in the mucous membrane; some of these can be traced nearly to the floor of the nose. The middle branches are distributed to tlie mucous membrane lining the roof of each nostril. Ihee^Ier- 7ial descend along the grooves on the turbi- nated bones, dividing and communicating frequently with each other, so as to form numerous plexuses, which are lost in the pituitary membrane. All the branches of the olfactory nerves are very soft in the cranium, but in passing through the ethmoid bone they each receive a sheath from the dura mater, which is ultimately lost in the external layer of the mucous membrane.â€”(See the Anatomy of the Nose.)

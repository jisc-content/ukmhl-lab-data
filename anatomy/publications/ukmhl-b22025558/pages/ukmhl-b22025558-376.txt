366 of the opposite side ; 2d, the ascending cervical ascends along and is distributed to the anterior scalenus, longus colli, and rectus capitis anticus major muscles ; 3rd, supra-scapular runs obliquely outwards and downwards beneath the clavicle, passes above the notch in the su- perior costa of the scapula, supplies the supra-spinatus muscle, and descends beneath the acromion process to the infra-spinatus and teres minor muscles; 4th, trans- versalis colli ascends obliquely outwards round the sca- leni muscles, and beneath the trapezius, it divides into two branches, one, the cervicalis superjicialis, supplies the superficial muscles on the side and back part of the neck ; the other, the posterior scapidar arlerp, descends beneath the levator anguli scapulae, and the rhomboid muscles along the base of the scapula as far as the infe- rior angle, where it inosculates with the subscapular artery ; the posterior aiâ€™tery of the scapula, as also the supra-scapular in many subjects, arise distinctly from the subclavian artery. The internal mammary artery arises opposite the thyroid axis, it desends obliquely forwards and inwards, between the cartilages of the ribs and the pleura, as far as the ensiform cartilage, it gives branches to the pleura, pericardium, and mediastinum, a long branch to the diaphragm, which accompanies the phrenic nerve, also intrecostal branches, which inosculate with the aortic intercostals; it terminates by sending branches to the diaphragm, and to the abdominal muscles, the latter inosculate with the epigastric ar- tery. The superior intercostal artery arises betsveen the scaleni, descends behind the pleura, in front of the neck of the Island 2d ribs, and supplies the two first pair of intercostal muscles. The cervicalis profunda arises opposite tlie last, as- cends obliquely backwards and outwards, between the transverse processes of the 6th and 7th cervical verte- brae, and ascending on the back of the neck, supplies the complexus and tire other deep muscles in that re- gion, and inosculates with the descending branches of the occipital artery.

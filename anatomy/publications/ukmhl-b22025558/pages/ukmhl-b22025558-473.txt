463 terior extremity is slightly convex, smooth above' and covered by a bursa, and rough below for the insertion ot the tendo achillis ; the anterior extremity is smaller, and presents an articular surface for the cuboid bone, which is concave from above downwards and convex from side to side; externally it is rather flat, being marked with two shallow grooves, for the peroneal ten- dons, a spine separates these, into this the external lateral ligament of the ankle joint is inserted, internally it is broad and hollowed out into an arch, under which the flexor tendons, the tibialis posticus and the plantar vessels and nerves pass, the tendon of the flexor pollicis runs in a distinct groove; the os calcis is attached above to the astragalus and before to the cuboid. The or Scaphoid Bone is situated about the middle of the tarsus and at its upper and internal pai t; of an oval form, its posterior surface is smooth and concave, to form a sort of superficial or denoid cavity for the head of the astragalus, the latter however IS much larger and projects interiorly, in which direc tion It IS supported by the strong calceo-scaphoid liga- ment, and by the tendon of the tibialis posticus, which here generally contains a sesamoid bone; the anterior surface is convex, and divided by two vertical ridges into three surfaces for the three cuneiform bones- the circumference is irregular for the attachment of’lio-a- meins, internally it is rather smooth, but inferiorlv^ it presents a tubercle into which the tibialis posiicu^s is inserted ; on its external side there is in general a smal flat articular surface for the cuboid bone- the scaphoid IS connected to the astragalus, to the ’three cuneiform and to the cuboid bones. ««ter and anterior par of the tarsus external to the navicular, and anterior 0 the calcaneum ; although of a cubical form, it is yet thicker and longer internally than externally, its upper su ace IS flat and rough for the attachment df'ligaZnt and muscles, the lower surface is irregular, roulTand tubercular behind for the calceo-cuboid iicramen am\ grooved before for tlie tendon of the peronmns b n ^ ns posterior surface is smooth, concave transversl^y’ and convex from above downwards; it articulates with

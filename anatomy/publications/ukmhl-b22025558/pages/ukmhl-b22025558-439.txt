429 is the nasal spine and the orifices of the frontal sinuses, its edges are cellular to unite to and communicate with the cells of the ethmoid bone; along its margins are two foramina, the anterior and posterior orbital, they are common to this and to the ethmoid bone, the anterior transmits the nasal twig of the ophthalmic nerve and ante- rior ethmoidal artery, the posterior, the posterior ethmoi- dal artery; on either side are the orbitalprocessessmooih, concave, and triangular, the apex behind, present- ing near thetexternal angular process a deep pit for the lachrymal gland, and near the internal a slight depression for the cartilaginous pulley of the superior oblique mus- cle of the eye, instead of a depression there is sometimes a small spine : the cerebral surface of these processes is convex, but very uneven, marked by the brain and ves- sels ; their posterior margins are thin, and cut obliquely to support the lesser wings of the sphenoid bone. The processes of this bone, enumerated by anatomists, are II, viz., 2 orbital, 4 angular, 2 superciliaiy, 2 tempo- ral, and 1 nasal; the foramina are 9, viz., 1, the fora- men ccecum, 2 and 3, the frontal sinuses, between the nasal and internal angular processes, 4 and 5, the su- praorbital, 6 and 7, the anterior, and 8 and 9 the pos- terior orbital; these last, as well as the foramen coecumj are often common to this and the ethmoid bone. The os frontis is joined to 4 bones of the cranium, viz., the two parietal, the sphenoid and ethmoid, and to 8 bones of the face, viz., the nasal, superior maxillary, lachry- mal, and malar. The structure is thick towards the nasal protuberance and superciliary ridges, but very thin in the orbital plates; it is composed of two com- pact laminae and an intervening diploe, by the absorp- tion of the latter and the greater separation of the plates, the cavities called the frontal sinuses are form- ed ; these do not exist in childhood, and in the adult their extent is very variable; they generally extend from the ethmoid notch upwards and outwards for one third of the superciliary arch, sometimes much further; they are generally separated by a septum ; their use is not fully ascertained. This "bone is deve- loped from two points of ossification, one in each fron- tal prominence; from this the bone extends in rays

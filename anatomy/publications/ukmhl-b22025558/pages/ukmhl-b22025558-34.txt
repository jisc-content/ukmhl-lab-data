24 Stekno-Thyroideus is broader and shorter than the last, arises from the posterior surface of the ster- num and cartilage of the second rib, ascends obliquely outwards, and is insertedxnio the oblique line on the ala of the thyroid cartilage. Use, to depress the larynx. This muscle is covered by the slerno-mastoid and hyoid muscles, and by the skin ; it conceals the vena innominata and carotid artery, the thyroid gland, and the trachea; between it and the latter there is a consi- derable quantity of cellular membrane which contains several veins {inferior thyroid v.). Several filaments ot the descendens noni nerve are distributed to this and to the former muscle. It is between the sterno-thyrmd muscles that the operation of tracheotomy is performed, while that of laryngotomy is between the sterno-hyoid muscles and between the thyroid and cricoid carti- ^MO HYOIDEus is long, slender, and digastric, arises broad and fleshy from the superior costa of the scapula behind its semilunar notch, from the ligament covering that notch, sometimes from the base of the coracoid process, and sometimes also from the acromial end ot the clavicle; it ascends obliquely forwards a little above the clavicle, passes beneath the sterno-mptoid muscle, where it is generally tendinous, except in tlie very young subject; becoming again fleshy, it ascends nearly vertical along the outer side of the sterno- hyoid, and is inserted fleshy into the lower border of the os hyoides at the junction of its body and cornu. Use, (the muscle of one side cannot act independent of the other,) both draw the os hyoides, pharynx, and larynx downwards and backwards, and m de-lutition serve lo urge the food into the oesophagus. The oriLun of this muscle is concealed by the trapezius, it lies anterior to the insertion of the levator anguh scapulae and between the serratus magnus and supra- spiiatus muscles: the posterior belly is covered only by the integuments and fitscia, and divides the great pLterior lateral triangle of the neck into an interior Ld superior part, as was before lion ofthe omo-hyoid can frequently be distinguished n the living neck. The tendon crosses the carotid artly and jugular vein, and is covered by the sterno-

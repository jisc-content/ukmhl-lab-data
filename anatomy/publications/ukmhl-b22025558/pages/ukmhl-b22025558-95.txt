85 it arises from the posterior third of the crest of the ilium, from the oblique and transverse processes of the sacrum, from the sacro-iliac ligaments, and from the transverse and oblique processes of the lumbar verte- bra; ; it ascends and divides into several long tendons, which are inserted into all the ribs near their angles. Use, to extend the spine, and bend it a little to one side, also to depress the ribs as in expiration. The laiigissimus dorsi lies internal to the last, and arises in common with it, from the posterior surface of the sa- crum and of the transverse and oblique processes of the lumbar vertebrae; ascending along the vertebral co- lumn, it is inserted internally by small tendons into all the dorsal vertebrm, and externally by fleshy and ten- dinous slips into all the ribs between their tubercles and angles. Use, to extend, bend to one side, and support the spinal column. When we separate the sacro-lum- balis from the longissimus dorsi and evert the former, we shall expose five or six small tendinous and fleshy fasciculi which arise from the superior edge of each rib, and ascending are inserted into the tendons of the sacro.lumbalis ; these are called thq miiscidi acccssorii; they are very irregular in number, structure and size. Spinalis dorsi lies between the longissimus dorsi and spine ; it arises from the two superior lumbar and three infenor dorsal spines ; it ascends close to the spinal co- lumn, and is inserted into the nine superior dorsal spines : its use is similar to the last. These three mus- cles are covered by the lumbar fascia, and by the twm preceding layers. These lumbar muscles in old sub- jects H'ill be often found soft, weak, and pale, and often blended with a soft fatty substance, so as sometimes to resemble a mass of adipocere. Cervicalis Descendens, or more properly Ascen- DENs, looks like a continuation of the sacro-lumbalis, internal to which it arises by four or five tendons from as many of the superior ribs between their tubercles and angles; these unite in a small fleshy belly, which ascends obliquely forwards and outwards, and is inserted by three or four tendons into the transverse processes ot the 4rth, 5th and 6th cervical vertebrae, between the 1

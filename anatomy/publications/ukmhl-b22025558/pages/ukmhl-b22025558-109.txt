99 of the humerus, and extends from the scapula to the olecranon ; it consists superiorly of three portions, viz. the middle or long head, the second or external head, and the third or internal, or short head, or brachiseus internus or posticus. The long, or middle head, arises by a flat short ten- don about an inch broad, from the lower part of the neck of the scapula, and from the anterior portion of the inferior costa; it also adheres to the inferior part of the capsular ligament; it soon ends in a large fleshy belly which descends along the back part of the hu- merus, that'surface which is towards the bone conti- nues tendinous for some distance ; about the superior third of the arm it joins the second or external head, which arises immediately below the insertion of the teres minor, by a narrow tendinous and fleshy slip, from a ridge on the outer side,of the humerus commencing below the great tuberosity, and leading down to the external condyle ; it also arises from the bone behind this ridge, from the intermuscular ligament, and from the external condyle, by a tendon which passes upwards and inwards, and joins the remainder of the muscle; these inferior fibres are parallel to the anconmus; the third, or short head, or brachiceiis interims, or posticus, improperly called brachiieus extcrnus, arises narrow on the inside of the humerus, above its centre, com- mencing tendinous just below the insertion of the teres major, and continuing to arise from the ridge which leads to the internal condyle, and from the internal intermuscular ligament ; these three portions of the triceps unite above the middle of the arm, and descending along its posterior part, end in a flat broad tendon which consists of two laminae, a super- ficial and a deep; the former is continued into the fascia on the back part of the forearm, the latter, wliich is stronger but narrower, is inserted into the olecranon process. Use, to extend the forearm on the arm, and by its long portion to carry the arm back- wards, and in some cases to adduct it; it also draws up the synovial membrane from between the olecra- non process and the humerus, and thus protects it from pressure in the extended state of the limb.

372 The Abdomikal Aorta sends ofF the following branches; the phrenic, cceliac axis, superior mesen- teric, inferior mesenteric, renal, supra-renal, spermatic, lumbar, and middle sacral. The phrenic arteries arise in common, or near each other, from the fore-part of the aorta; they both send branches to the supra-renal capsules and to the crura of the diaphragm; the right ascends behind the vena cava; the left behind the oesophagus; on the dia- phragm each divides into an external and internal branch ; the former passes towards the circumference of the muscle, and inosculates with the internal mam- mary and the inferior intercostals; the latter encircles the central tendon, communicates with its fellow and with the phrenic branches of the mammary. The cceliac axis arises from the fore-part of the aorta opposite the last dorsal vertebra; it soon divides into three branches, 1st, the gastric artery ascends ob- liquely to the left side, to the cardiac orifce, to which and to the oesophagus it sends several branches; it then bends along the lesser curvature towards the right side between the laminae of the lesser omentum, and inos- culates with the superior pyloric artery; it sends its branches to the anterior and posterior surfaces of the stomach; 2nd, hepatic artery ascends obliquely to- wards the right side, in front and to the left side of the vena porta and ductus choledochus, and in the transverse fissure of the liver, divides into right and left hepatic arteries; in this course it gives off the superior pyloric, which passes along the upper surface of the pylorus and joins the gastric artery ; and the (rastro-duodenalis which descends between the pylo- rus and the duodenum ; this gives off inferior pyloric branches, and divides into the pancreatico-duodenalis and gastro-epiploica dextra : the Iâ€™ormer takes a curved course between the duodenum and the pancreas, sending branches to each, and inosculates with the superior mesenteric artery; the latter turns forwards, and to the left side along the great curvature of the stomach, between it and the laminae of the great omen- tum, to which, as well as the stomach, it sends nu-

Flexor Pollicis Brevis, consists of two portions, between which is the tendon of tlie flexor longus; one head, the external or anterior arises from the inside of the annular ligament, and from the trapezium and scap- hoid bones, passes outwards, and is inserted into the external sesamoid bone and base of the 1st phalanx of the thumb; the 2d, or internal or posterior arises from the os magnum, and the base of the metacarpal bone of tbe middle finger ; ii also passes outwards, distinct from the other at first, but afterwards united to it, and is inserted into the internal sesamoid bone, and base of the 1st phalanx. Use, to flex the first phalanx and meta- carpal bone on the carpus: this muscle is concealed by the twm former, and bv the first lumbricalis ; it covers the two first interossei muscles, and the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis; its outer edge is connected to the opponens pollicis, and the internal to the adductor. Adductor Pollicis, triangular and broad, arises fleshy from three-fourths of the anterior surface of the third metacarpal bone, the ^bres pass outwards over the second metacarpal, and converging are inserted into -the inner side of the root of the first phalanx of the thumb, along with part of the last muscle; its name de- notes its use. This muscle at its origin is covered ante- riorly by the deep flexor tendons and by the lumbri- cales; its insertion is covered by the following muscle, wâ€™hich may be best seen from behind. Abductor Ixdicis, also triangular, arises tendinous and fleshy from the metacarpal bone of the forefinger, and from one half of that of the thumb; its fibres ex- tend obliquely inwards and forwards, end in a tendon which passes by the outer side of the first joint of the forefinger, and is inserted into the outer side of the base of its first phalanx. Use, to separate the forefinger from the others, or to adduct the thumb. This muscle is superficial posteriorly; anteriorly it is covered by that last described; the radial artery passes between its two heads or origins; this muscle is similar to, and may be regarded as one of the posterior interossei, like these also, its insertion joins that of the common extensor tendon. In the middle of tlie palm of the hand are seen four small muscles.

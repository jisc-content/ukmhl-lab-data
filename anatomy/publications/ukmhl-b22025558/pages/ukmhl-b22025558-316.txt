306 and muscles covering the malar bone; the temporal branch also passes through the malar bone into the temporal fossa, pierces the temporal fascia, becomes cutaneous, and joining some branches of the facial nerve, it accompanies the temporal artery, and is lost in the integuments of the temple and head. Tlie su- perior maxillary nerve next gives off l\\e posterior dental nerves; these are two or three branches which wind round the tuberosity of the maxillary bone, enter small foramina, which lead to the posterior alveoli m this bone, and supply the molar teeth ; some branches also supply the gums and the buccinator muscle. As the infra-orbital nerve, which is the last branch of the su- perior maxillary, proceeds along the floor of the orbit, it sends off some small filaments to the tat and muscles in this region, also the anterior dental; this descends along the fore-part of the antrum, to the lining mem- brane of which it gives some fine filaments and is then lost in several branches which supply the canine and incisor teeth: the infra-orbital nerve then escapes through the foramen of the same name beneath the orbicularis palpebrarum and levator labii superions alaeque nasi muscles; it here divides into several branches which are distributed to the face, some of these ascend to the palpebrae, others pass outwards to the cheek, and the largest branches descend to the ala nasi and to the upper lip ; these different branches have frequent communications on the side of the face with the portio dura, on the nose with the nasal nerves, and on the buccinator muscle they form a plexus with each other and with the buccal and facial nerves. The Inferior Maxillary Nmve; this, which is the third and largest branch of ’"J* mediately passes from the ganglion men ovale into the zygomatic fossa behind the extei- Ild pterygoid muscle, where it divides into two large brancheJ,^a superior or external, and an inferior or internal The inferior maxillary nerve consists of two portions, one is plexiform, and P>-oceeds from the g^ scrian ganglion, the other is concealed bj thi , a consists of white parallel fibres whici throu.^h the ganglion; in the zygoma ic fos^a ^is sma1l*^deep portion winds round the other, beco e>

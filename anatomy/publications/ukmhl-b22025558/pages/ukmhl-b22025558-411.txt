401 broad into the inner edge of the radius below the ulna, which bone it separates from the wrist joint, or froni the cuneiform bone, its anterior and posterior edges are connected to the ligamentous fibres that pass from the ulna to the radius. RADIO-CARPAL ARTICtlLATION, OR THE WRIST JOINT. In this joint the lower end of the radius and the intcr- articular-cartilage form a socket for the scaphoid, lunar, and cuneiform bones; this joint is secured by an external and internal lateral, and by a posterior and anterier ligament. The external lateral extends from the styloid pro- cess of the radius and is inserted into the scaphoid bone; some fibres extend to the annular ligament and to the os trapezium. The internallaterfd extends obliquely downwards and forwards, from the styloid process of the ulna to the cuneiform bone. The anterior and posterior ligaments descend from the radius and inter-articular cartilage anteriorly and posteriorly, and are inserted into the superior row of the carpus. A synovial membrane covers the superior row of the carpal bones, is thence reflected to line the ligaments, and is continued over the articular surface of the radius, and of the inter.articular cartilage. The three first bones of the carpus are connect- ed to each other by ligamentous bands, both on the dorsal and palmar aspects, passing in difl'erent direc- tions from one bone to another ; the pisiform is ar- ticulated distinctly to the cuneiform bone; the bones of the second row are connected to each other in the same manner as those of the first, and the two rows are attached by two lateral ligaments and by dorsal and palmar bands, also by the head of the os magnum being received into the cavity formed by the lunar and scaphoid bones ; one synovial mem- brane extends between these two rows, and sends processes between the individual bones; the bones of the carpus are also firmly connected to each other by the annidar ligamenty\s\\\eh is inserted externally ' M M 2

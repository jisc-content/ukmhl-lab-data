317 f^ificial and deep, the latter of internal and external; the ascending superhcial branches are two or three in number, they ascend obliquely forwards over the sterno- inastoid muscle, supply the platysma and integuments over the parotid gland, also on the ear and on the side and back part ot the head, and communicate freely vMti tie portio dura of the 7th pair of nerves; one of these IS much larger than_ the others, is named super- colli, it may be traced chiefly from the third cervical, and is lost near the ear and in the parotid ghyid; this nerve accompanies the external jugular vein. The deep ascending branches of the plexus, are small nerves which supply the sterno mas- toid, digastric, splenius and adjacent muscles, and com- municate with the neighbouring nerves. The descend- ing branches are internal and external, the internal are two, a superficial and a deep; the superficial internal descending branch joins the descendens noni, and assists It in supplying the superficial muscles on the fore-part ot the neck. The deep internal descending branch is the j)}irenic nerve: this arises from the lower part of the plexus, chiefly from the 4th cervical, it has also in general a fi.ament or two from the brachial plexus ; the phrenic nerve, or, as it is also named, the internal res- piratory nerve descends obliquely inwards, on the an- terior scalenus muscle, at the lower part of the neck it communicates with the lower cervical ganglion, and olten with the vagus or its recurrent, it then enters the thorax between the subclavian vein and artery, and de- scends to the diaphragm on the side of the pericardium between It and the pleura; the right phrenic is nearly perpendicular, the left takes an oblique course round the apex of the heart, it is therefore longer and lies more posterior than the right. On the diaphragm these nerves divide mio several branches, some of which ra- mify on the superior surface of that muscle, others on Its interior accompanying the phrenic vessels. These branches on the right side send some filaments to the inferior vena cava and to the liver, and unite with the o7ihelln of (he stomach; on the left stile the phrenic nerve sends some filaments E E 2

52 levator anguli scapulae, which muscles cannot be exa- mined at present. We shall next proceed to the dissec- tion of the thorax. CHAP. III. DISSECTION OF THE THORAX. SECTION I. OF THE MUSCLES ON THE ANTERIOR AND LATERAL PARTS OF THE THORAX. Make one incision through the integuments along the clavicle, a second from the upper end of the sternum to the ensiform cartilage, and from this point carry ^ towards the shoulder; reflect the integuments and sub- jacent cellular membrane from within and from below, upwards and outwards, and thus the great pectoral mus- cle will be exposed, the dissection of which will be taci- iitated if its fibres be made tense by separating tlm arm from the side. Beneath the integuments in the female we find the mammary gland; this is a conglomerate gland, imbedded in fat, hemispherical, flat posteriorly, convex anteriorly, surrounded by a capsule of condensed cellular membrane, which is loosely connected to the pectoral muscle, and sends processes into the gland to support and connect its several lobules; these last are very soft and pale, almost white; from each of them small ducts arise, which uniting together form larger tubes; these converge towards the root of the nipp e, where they expand into sinuses, from which smaller ducts proceed and open on its surface; the skin cover- ing the breast is soft and delicate, and about the centre of it, is the conical projection called the nipple, near the point of which the lactiferous ducts open ; the base is surrounded by an areola of a dark colour. This gland will be found to differ in structure in different subjects ; in some the capsule is indistinct, and the lobules sea -

^19 teriorly by the pale mucous membrane descending into the oesophagus : these and the crico-thyroid muscles are the dilators of the rima glottidis. Ahytenoideus, fills tlie interval between the aryte- noid cartilages, and is enclosed in a fold of mucous membrane : it consists of oblique and transverse fibres; the former consist of two or three fasciculi, M'hich pass from the apex of one cartilage to the base of the oppo- site ; the transverse fibres are more numerous, and are attached to the posterior surface of each cartilage. Use, to approximate these cartilages, and close the sides of the rima: these, together with the thyro and crico-ary. tenoidei laterales are the contractors of the rima glottis. In the aryteno-epiglottidean folds, fleshy fibres are sometimes discernible, and have been described as dis- tinct muscles, and named from their situation, aryteno- epiglottidean and thyreo-epiglottidean or the depressors of the epiglottis. In the human subject, however, these are never sufficiently well marked to merit the appella- tion of distinct muscles. The arteries which supply the larynx are derived from the superior and inferior thyroid ; the former is a branch of the external carotid, the latter of the subcla- vian. The lar3'ngeal nerves are four in number, two on each side, the superior and injerior ; both are derived Irom the par vagum or pneumo-gastric ; the former arising from it near the base of the cranium, the latter, on the rightside, comes oftâ€™from this trunk at the lower part of the neck, and on the left side it arises from it in the thorax, below the arch of the aorta: the inferior laryngeal nerves are principally distributed to the mus- cles, and the superior to the membrane and glands of the larynx, but not exclusively so. The inferior supply the posterior and lateral crico- arytenoid and the thyro-arytenoid muscles ; the superior sends a large branch to the arytenoid, and a small, but very long filament to the crico-thyroid muscle; several branches of this nerve are distributed to the epiglottis, and to the mucous membrane at the glottis, which in this situation possesses great sensibility.

326 The Sacral Nerves are five pair, they divide within the spinal canal into their anterior and posterior branches, the latter, very small, pass through the pos- terior sacral holes and supply the muscles and integu- ments ; the anterior branches are very large, parUcu- larly the three superior, the two last are much smaller ; these five nerves, with the branch from the last lum- bar, form the sacrctl plexus, large and flat, placed on the sacrum and pyramidal muscle behind the rectum, and the other pelvic viscera, it sends off the^ following branches both internal and external; the internal or pelvic are the haemorrhoidal and vesical, and in the fe- male the uterine and the vaginal; the external branches are the inferior glutaeal, the inferior or lesser sciatic, posterior cutaneous, pudic, and great sciatic or poste- rior crural. The hcemorrhoidal, vesical, uienne and vaginal branches are all small nerves which arise from the upper part of the plexus, are entangled with ac- companying vessels, and interlace with each other; they are distributed to the different pelvic viscera, as their names imply. The lesser sciatic nerve escapes from the pelvis with the former and with the sciatic artery, it then passes downwards to the space between the tuber iscbii and trochanter major, but nearer to the former, round which it twrnes, and at its lower part divides into two sets of branches, a superficial and a deep ; the for- mer pass over the hamstring muscles with the poste- rior cutaneous nerve and are lost in these rnuscles; and the latter pass under the muscles ami are distributed to the quadratus femoris, upper part of the adductor mag- iius muscles, &c. and some go to the hip joint. Ihe inferior dutccnl nerve leaves the pelvis below the py- riform muscle, and divides at once into several branches, which are principally distributed to the glu. taeus maximus, some also pass to the perinaeum and to the inner side of the thigh. The posterior cutaneous nerve arises in common with the preceding from the se- cond and third sacral nerves, escapes from the pelvis below the pyriform muscle, becomes cutaneou.Â«, and descends alLvg the back part of tbe thigh and leg and communicates with the cutaneous nerves in the lattei Jeg^r The pudic nerve arises from the third and

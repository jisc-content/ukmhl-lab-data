240 over the poplitaeus muscle, and is inserted into the pos- terior part of the heads of the tibia and fibula, and is also continuous with the deep fascia of the leg; the third process appears the continuation of the tendon, it turns forwards beneath the internal lateral ligament, round the head of the tibia into which it is inserted. Use, to extend the thigh on the pelvis, and to support the latter on the thigh, to flex the knee and to rotate the leg inwards; it also strengthens the back part of the knee, and can draw the synovial membrane out of the angle of the joint. This muscle, at its origin, lies external to the other hamstrings; it is covered at first by the semi-tendinosus, biceps, and glutaeus maximus, inferiorly it is superficial; above it passes over the quadratus femoris and adductor magnus muscles; below it overlaps the popliteal vessels, and the internal head of the gastrocnemius, from which last it is separated by a bursa; the sciatic nerve is on its outer, the gracilis on its inner side. The arteries which are met with in the dissection of these muscles are branches of the sciatic, circumflex, perforating and articular, the numerous ramifications of these vessels are distributed to the hamstring and adductor muscles, and are accompanied by their cor- responding veins ; the principal nerve in this situation is the great sciatic; from the back part of the hip joint this large nerve descends along the back of the thigh to the upper part of the popliteal space, where it divides into the peronaeal and posterior tibial nerves: in this course it is covered at first by the glutaeus maximus, afterwards by the biceps and semi-tendi- nosus, and inferiorly by the integuments and fascia; having passed over tlie quadratus femoris and the other small muscles at the back of the hip joint, it next lies on the adductor magnus, and inferiorly on a quantity of adipose substance. The sciatic nerve gives off several cutaneous and muscular filaments, in addi- tion to its two terminating branches, the peronteal and the posterior tibial ; the feronceal nerve takes the course of the biceps tendon towards the head of the fibula, where it divides into several branches which are distributed to the integuments and muscles on the outer

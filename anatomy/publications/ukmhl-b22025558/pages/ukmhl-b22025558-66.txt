56 lies on a plane anterior to the next or middle division, which is very thin, consisting of but few fleshy fibres, connected together by an aponeurosis. This portion is of a triangular form, the apex attached to the fld and 4-th ribs, the base to the basis of the scapula, not ex- actly to the bone, but to a strong tendinous cord, which extends along this line from the superior to the inferior angle. The third, or inferior division of the serratus is the strongest and most extensive ; it is ra- diated or triangular ; apex thick and fleshy, at- tached to the inferior angle of the scapula; the base thin and expanded on the ribs. 1 he serratus may be ao'ain examined when dissecting the muscles on the back of the tr U 0 j\.« Inteucostales, are 22 in number on each side, 11 external and 11 internal;—the commence at the transverse processes of the dorsal vertebrae, arise from the inferior edge of eacli rib, descend in fasciculi obliquely forwards, and are inserted into the external lip of the superior edge ol the rib beneath, and termi- nate a little behind the costal extremity of the carti- lages : an aponeurosis, the fibres of whicli run in the same direction, supply their place as tar as the ster- nuna. The internal intercostal muscles take an oppo- site direction, and decussate the former; they com- mence at the sternu.m, and are discontinued at the an- gles of the ribs ; they arise from the inner lip of the lower edge of each cartilage and rib, the fibies, paler and shorter than tho^e of the external, descend ob- liquely backwards, and are inserted into the inner hp of the superior edge of the cartilage and rib beneath. JJse both lamincC co-operate to raise the ribs, thenist rib being fixed by the scaleni. Tire nitei-costal mus- cles, in elevating the ribs, also evert their louer edges, and twist them at their vertebral and sternal ends, and thus assist in inspiration, by enlarging the chest trans- versely, and from before backwards. The internal layer lies on the pleura, and is separated from the exteina by the intercostal vessels and nerves; the external layer is connected to the pleura only in the space be- tween the angles of the ribs and the vei tebia?.

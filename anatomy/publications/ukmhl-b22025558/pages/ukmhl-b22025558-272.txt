262 runs obliquely forwards and inwards, towards the first metatarsal bone, above the second layer of the plantar muscles, and between the first and second metatarsal bones it joins the deep branch of the anterior tibial artery, and thus forms the great plantar arch of arte- ries, from the convexity of which proceed the digital arteries, to supply the toes, (see Anatomy of the Vas- cular System.) The posterior tibial artery and its se- veral branches are accompanied by corresponding veins, all of which end in the popliteal vein. Ihe /jqs- terior tibial nerve is the principal branch of the sciatic, it accompanies the posterior tibial artery, at first lying to its tibial, afterwards to its fibular side; in this course it sends off several small branches to the deep and su- perficial muscles of the leg, and between the heel and ankle it divides into the two plantar nerves, which take the course of the corresponding arteries. In this in- ternal malleolar region, when the integuments, tascia and internal annular ligament are i-emoved, we find the three tendons, the posterior tibial nerves and vessels to have the followdng relation to each other, the tibialis posticus and flexor communis tendons are bound close to the ankle, about half an inch behind these is the pos- terior tibial artery accompanied by two veins, the nerve is a little nearer to the heel, and the tendon oi the flexor pollicis lies about half an inch nearer to the latter.

304 fifth pair. Remove the outer wall of the orbit with the saw or hammer, make a vertical section of the nose and face, and separate the globe of the eye and its muscles from their attachments; below the cavity of the orbit the superior maxillary nerve may be seen. The Superior Maxillary Nerve passes from the middle of the gasserian ganglion forwards through the foramen rotundum into the pterygo-maxillary fossa ; it here sends off several branches, and continues its course forwards along the infra-orbital canal to the cheek, where it terminates in the infra-orbital nerves ; in the pterygo-maxillary fossa it first sends down two small branches along the back part of the superior max- illary bone; these, after a short course, unite in a small triangular reddish substance called the spheno-palntine ganglion, or the ganglion of Meckel; this ganglion is imbedded in fat, surrounded by the branches of the in- ternal maxillary artery, and is situated on the external side of the nasal plate of the palate bone, which sepa- rates it from the cavity of the nose, behind the tubero- sity of the superior maxillary bone, and in front of the pterygoid processes. Three branches proceed from Meckel’s ganglion, an inferior, internal, and posterior. First the inferior or the palntine nerve descends in the bony canal of that name, sends some small twigs through this canal to the spongy bones, and near the palate di- vides into three filaments, an anterior, middle, and pos- terior ; the anterior passes forwards in a groove within the alveoli and above the mucous membrane, supplying the latter and sending small branches into the bone to the teeth: the middle and posterior filaments of the palatine nerve are distributed to the amygdalae, the soft palate, and the uvula. The internal branch, or the spheno-palatine nerve is very short, passes through the spheno-palatine hole into the upper and back part of the nose, and divides into five or six branches; the most of these pass immediately into the mucous mem- brane, covering the superior and middle spongy bones, one branch called the naso-polaiine ne}ve, or nerve 0/ ■ Cotunnius, passes beneath the sphenoidal sinus, and de- scends obliquely forwards along the septum nasi as tar as the foramen incisivum, where it communicates with

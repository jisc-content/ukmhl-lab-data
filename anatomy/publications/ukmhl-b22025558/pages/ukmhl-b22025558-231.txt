221 passes behind the condyle of the femur; it then turns forwards and outwards towards the inner side of the tipper end of the tibia, into which it is inserted below the tubercle, by a long flat tendon, the anterior edge of ■which is attached to the fascia lata covering the knee jointj and the posterior edge sends oft an aponeurosis to the fascia of the leg. Use, to flex the leg upon the thigh, also the latter on the pelvis ; to adduct the ihio'h and leg obliquely, so as to cross the lovver extremitii^; when the thigh and leg are extended, it assists in rais- ing and advancing forwards the whole limb, also in tuining the knee outwards; when the knee is bent, it may turn the leg and toes inwards; in standing, it also supports die pelvis and prevents it bending backwards on the thigh. This muscle through its whole extent IS covered only by the fascia lata and the integuments, Its superior extremity lies between the tensor vaginal and the ihacus internus muscles ; its inferior extremity expands into a strong aponeurosis, which covers and adheres to the tendons of the semi-tendinosus and ^va- cihs tnuscles; in its course along the thigh it first passes over the psoas, iliacus, and rectus muscles, next over the abductor muscles and the femoral vessels, from which it IS separated by a strong aponeurosis; infe- norJy It passes over the internal lateral ligament of the knee, between the tendons of the adductor magnusand the gracihs. The superior third of this muscle extends m an oblique direction from the ilium downwards and inwards, forms the external boundary of the inc^uinal region and lies to the outer side of the femoral vessels • the middle third is more vertical in its course, and is here about two inches broad, and completely covers the femoral vessels, also a part of the adductor, and vastus intc-rnus muscles. centre, placed vertically on the fore-part of the thiah rnt^L^^f^n inferior and nternal, from the anterior inferior spinous process of •rom tlio superior and exiernal border of the acetabu- lum, and Irom the capsular ligament; these tendons u 2

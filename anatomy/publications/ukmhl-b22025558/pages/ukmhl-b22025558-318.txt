308 it by a small twig ; it descends at first between the two pterygoid muscles, then between the lower jaw and the internal pterygoid ; it is here separated from the latter by the internal lateral ligament ; about the middle of the internal surface of the lamus of the jaw it sends off a small filament, the mylo-hyoid nerve, this descends obliquely forwards, confined in a groove in the bone by an expansion from the internal lateral ligament; near the chin it divides into small branches for the mylo- hyoid, genio-hyoid, and digastric muscles. The dental nerve then enters the canal in the lower jaw, which ex- tends from the dental foramen obliquely forwards be- neath the teeth as far as the chin ; in this course, this nerve, which is accompanied by the dental vessels, supplies each of the molar and canine teeth with soft delicate twigs, and at the mental foramen it divides into two branches, one continues its course within the bone beneath the incisor teeth, the other is the mental nerve ; this escapes by the mental foramen, bends up- wards, and divides in a radiated manner into several branches vvhich pass to the muscles, mucous membi ane, and integuments of the lower lip, and communicate with the facial nerve. Third, the lingual ov gustatory nerve is smaller than the dental, to which it is con- nected by a short branch which encloses a space through which the internal maxillary artery passes ; beyond this branch of communication ihe corda tyinpani (which has been before traced from Meckelâ€™s ganglion) joins the gustatory nerve at an acute angle ; the latter is in- creased in size at this spot; the gustatory nerve is here situated between theexternal pterygoid and the rnuscles of the palate and pharynx ; it then descends obliquely forwards between the internal pterygoid and the ramus of the lower jaw ; it next turns forwards above the sub- maxillary gland and the mylo-hyoid muscle and lies on the mylo-hyoidean attachment ot the superior constric- tor of the pharynx, and on the mucous membrane of the mouth and the hyo-glossus muscle, and accompanies the Whartonian duct; it then ascends above the sublm- eual gland and becomes attached to the lateral and an- terior parts of the tongue. In this course the gusta oiy nerve gives off, 1st, one or two small filaments to ihc internal pterygoid muscle; 2nd, several to t le oiisi s,

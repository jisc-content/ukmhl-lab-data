202 oval form, flattened on each side, also a little on the back part beneath the epididymis; it is suspended rather obliquely, the superior extremity being directed forwards and outwards, the inferior backwards and inwards. Bent like an arch, along the posterior sur- face of each testicle, is the epididymis, long and nar- row, large above (globus major), narrow in the middle (body), and again enlarged below (globus minor), at- tached to the testicle above by vessels, and in the rest of its extent by the reflected layer of the tunica vaginalis, closely on the internal, but very loosely on the external or femoral side; from its inferior extre- mity the vas deferens proceeds, and thence ascends along its internal side. Divide the tunica albuginea anteriorly and we observe the testicle to be composed of a soft greyish pulpy substance, which, when opened out a little, and floated in water, is found to consist of numerous fine tortuous shreds or vessels of delicate texture, loosely connected to each other; some are of considerable length, and with a little care may be drawn out of the gland to the extent of two or three feet; they are placed in packets or fasciculi, which are separated from each other by fibrous bands or septa, which are derived from the tunica albuginea, and which may now be seen to pass in considerable numbers through the gland towards the back pait, where they join the corpus Ughmorianmi: this name is applied to a long fold or process of the tunica al- buginea, which projects into the back part of the gland ; it consists of two laminae, between which the vessels and nerves of the testicle are enclosed: this process is broader above than below, is perforated in the former situation by the excretory ducts of the testicle; to its anterior border and sides are attached the sepimenta or processes of the tunica albuginea be- fore mentioned. From the several collections of small tubes, which are disposed between these hands or septa, about twelve or twenty larger vessels may be seen to proceed nearly in parallel lines towarcs tie back part of the gland; these are the tubidi recti ; they pierce the corpus highmorianum, and it one lamina of this process be raised oft'they will be seen entangled

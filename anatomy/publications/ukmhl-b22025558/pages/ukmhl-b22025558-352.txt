34^2 which rests on the membrane of the fenestra ovalis, be- tween which and the membrana tympani these four bones form a connecting chain, for the purpose of con- veying the impressions of sound from the membrana tympani to the internal ear. The malleus is immedi- ately behind the membrana tympani, it presents ahead, neck, handle, a long and short process; the head is smooth and articulated behind with the incus, the neck is small, and gives origin anteriorly to the processus gracilis, which is about half an inch long, traverses the glenoid fissure, and gives attachment to the tendon ot the laxator tympani muscle ; the handle descends from the neck, adheres to the membrana tympani, and has a short process superiorly for the insertion of the tensor tympani muscle. The incus is internal and posterior to the malleus, presents a body, and a long and short crus ; the body is directed forwards and upwards, and receives the head of the malleus, the superior crus is short, and lies in the foramen of the mastoid cells, the inferior long, and perpendicular, is articulated with the following ;—The os orbiculare, extremely small, is be- tw'een the incus and the following :—The is placed horizontally, the base is on the fenestra ovalis, the head is articulated to the orbicular bone, the neck gives attach- ment to the stapedius muscle, the crura ot the stirrup are separated by a space filled by membrane. There are three muscles in the tympanum, viz. sta- pedius, tensor, and laxator tympani. Stapedius arises within the pyramid ; its tendon is inserted inlo the neck of the stapes ; its use is to raise the stapes, and to press its base against the fenestra ovalis. Tensor tympani arises in the canal in the petrous bone above the Eus- tachian tube, passes backwards into the tympanum, and is inserted into the short process below the neck of the malleus; use to draw the malleus into the tym- panum, and thus to increase the concavity of the mem- brana tympani. Laxator tympani arises from the spi- nous process of the sphenoid bone, and from the Eus- tachian tube, ends in a delicate tendon whicli passes through the glenoid fissure along with the corda tym- pani, and is inserted into the processus gracilis ot the malleus or the process of Raw. Use, to draw the

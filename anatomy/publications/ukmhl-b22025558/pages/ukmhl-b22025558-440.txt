430 which unite in the mitklle line, but occasionally a su- ture remains between them; this has been said, but without sufficient foundation, to be more frequent in women than in men. Tlie Parietal Bones are symmetrical, and form the upper and lateral parts of the cranium; each is nearly square, convex, and smooth externally, about the cen- tre is the protuberance, which is better marked in children, below this is the curved temporal ridge con- tinuous with theprocess of that name on the os frontis, to this the temporal aponeurosis adheres ; below this it is rough for the attachment of the temporal muscle ; of the four edges, the upper or parietal is the longest, it is serrated, and with the opposite bone forms the sa- gittal suture; the anterior or frontal edge is also ser- rated to join the os frontis in the coronal suture; the posterior or occipital edge is very irregular, and joins the occipital bone in the lambdoid suture ; in this su- ture small bones called ossa Wormii or triquetra are often found ; the inferior or temporal edge is the shortest, it is concave, and joins the temporal bone by the squamous suture; of its four angles the anterior superior is nearly right, in the child this is deficient and the fontanelle exists ; the superior posterior angle is somewhat rounded ; near this in general is a foramen which transmits small vessels from the pericranium to the dura mater, the inferior anterior is long and curved and joins the sphenoid bone, the inferior posterior is very irregular and joins the mastoid portion ot the temporal bone ; the cerebral surface is marked by the convolutions of the brain, and by the branches of the middle artery of the dura mater; this vessel is in a groove, sometimes in a perfect canal or tube in the anterior inferior angle, and from this the branches pass upwards and backwards, a large one ascends a little posterior to the coronal edge ; along the parietal border is half a groove, which with that in the opposite bone, lodges the longitudinal sinus; near this are irregular depressions for the glandulae Pacchioni or the granula- tions of the dura mater; the posterior inferior angle is grooved and lodges part of the lateral sinus : the struc- ture of the parietal bone issimilar to that ot the frontal; I

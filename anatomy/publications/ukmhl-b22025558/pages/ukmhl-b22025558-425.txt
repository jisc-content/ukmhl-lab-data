415 The Sternum is situated at the forepart of the chest, in the median line, and in a direction from above down- wards and forwards; of a flat and elongated form, broad above, narrow in the middle, and pointed below j its an- terior surflice is covered by the skin and pectoral apo- neurosis, is marked by four transverse lines which indi- cate its original division into five pieces; the two upper lines are most prominent: the posterior surface is smooth and concave, gives attachment to muscles, and looks toward the anterior mediastinum ; the edges are thick, and present seven depressions for the cartilages of the true ribs; the superior of these is round, and the margin of it is often continuous with the 1st costal car- tilage; ^ the remaining depressions are angular, and most of them correspond to theâ€™ transverse lines or jidges; hence these sockets are more distinct in the young than in the old ; they are all covered with cartilage and separated from each other by notches. The upper or clavicular end of the sternum is broad, thick, and concave from side to side, for the lodgment of the inter- clavicular ligament, and is hollowed out at each ancrie for articulation with the clavicle, into a shallow sigmoid cavity covered with cartilage and directed outwards and backwards; this surface is slightly convex from before backivards; the inferior extremity is long and thin, and ends in a cartilaginous epiphysis, the xiphoid or ensi- .this is sometimes pointed, sometimes bifau, thick or thin, turned forwards or backwards, and sometimes perforated by a central hole; it remains car- tilaginous to a late period of life; to it the abdominal muscles and the costo-xiphoid ligament are attached, the sternum in the fcetus is separable into four or five pieces, m the adult into two. The upper piece is the arger and thicker of the two, and somewhat square Its edges receive the cartilages of the 1st rib, and half ot those of the second ; its lower edge is nearly straicrht and united to the 2nd piece by a cartilage which some- times admits of slight motion between the two, but which m old persons is generally found ossified ; a fora- men is sometimes observed in this piece of the sternum l ie 2nd piece is longer and narrower than the first its edges are marked by five depressions for the five lower

The vena portce receives the blood from all the abdominal viscera except the kidneys, bladder, and uterus; a large vein commences on the back of the rectum, (/iiFworr^o/^6f/) ascends towards the meso-colon and becomes the inferior mesenteric vein which ac- companies the artery of the same name; about the 2nd lumbar vertebra this unites with the sitnerior mesen- tenc vein which accompanies the artery of that'name also; behind the pancreas this trunk is joined by a very large vein, the splenic, which returns the blood iroin the spleen, and also receives the veins from the great and lesser curvatures of the stomach, from the duodenum pd pancreas; this large vein passes trans- versely behind the pancreas and below the splenic ar- tery the vena portae is formed by the union of the sp erne and mesenteric veins, in front of the aorta, and behind the pancreas ; it then ascends to the right side, enclosed in the lesser omentum and behind the hepa- tic artery and ductus choledochus; in this course it receives small veins from the omentum, pancreas, and gall-bladder;^ at the transverse fissure it divides at right angles into a right and left branch, which pass horizontally for a short distance, and form what is termed the sinus of the porta; this rests on the lo- bulus caudatus ; these branches then enter the liver, and ramify through its substance along with the branches of the hepatic artery and duct, and sur- rounded by the capsule of Glisson. The vena portae has no valves, whereas all the veins of the extremities are furnished with these, also the superficial veins of the neck; the deep veins of the neck, the vena azygos, and the pelvic veins, are de- on ^Â®^ts of the veiia portae are more dense and fibrous than those of most other veins; the thT w a very dense structure, that when divided it will often remain open like an L L

IV. ON COREELATIONS OF GROWTH, WITH A SPECIAL EXAMPLE FROM THE ANATOMY OF A PORPOISE. Philosophers of other countries have often taken occasion to remark, and in no complimentary terms, upon the utilitarian ten- dency constantly displayed by the English mind. Our everlasting seeking after hidden purposes, our infantine inquisitiveness after final causes in biological as well as other investigations, has fre- quently called forth contemptuous comments from foreigners who happened to be acquainted with Bacon's famous comparison of final causes to vestal virgins.

Our natural hankering after hypothesis, our constitutional craving after rationales, has called into use^ if not into being, the several theories of adherence to type, of complemental nutrition, of genealogical, yet modified, transmission, and of correlation of growth. The first of these theories has won with us not a little popularity; its antique dress, striking the eye, diverted the attention from the utter incongruity which exists between Platonic mysticisms and modern science; and, appealing to our reverence for the dreams of our youth, it has lived longer, and made more converts than un- assisted by the associations of the Academy it ever could have done. Even now it is fairly in the way of developing out of the larva stage of an Idolon Theatri into an Idolon Fori, a more active, elusive, albeit fragile, Imago. But a few years back, the joint empire of final and formal causes, of confederated teleological and

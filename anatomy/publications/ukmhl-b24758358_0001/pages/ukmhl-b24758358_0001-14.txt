vi PREFACE. the Clarendon Press, Messrs. Macmillan & Co., and C. G. Gates, Esq., for permission to reprint the Papers published under their respective auspices,â€”and the Messrs. Churchill for the use of a number of woodcuts. I have also to express my great indebtedness to Mrs. Rolleston for much valuable assistance in collecting the Papers; to Dr. James Murie, and Charles Robertson, Esq., for important help in compiling the chronological Hst of published writings; and to the latter gentleman, and W. Hatchett Jackson, Esq., for the aid they have given me in identifying some of the objects referred to in certain of the Papers with specimens contained in the Oxford Museum, and for other information. I have also received hints and suggestions of various kinds from Sir George Burrows, Bart., Sir Henry W. Acland, K.C.B., Prof. Flower, Prof. Max Muller, Prof. Moseley, J. Park Harrison, Esq., Edward Chapman, Esq., Dr. A. B. Shepherd, F. E. Beddard, Esq., E. S. Cobbold, Esq., and H. D. Rolleston, Esq., to all of whom I wish to convey my thanks. A Biographical Memoir has, at Mi-s. Rolleston's request, been kindly prepared by E. B. Tylor, Esq. I consider it a privilege to have been entrusted with the work of arranging and editing this collection of the writings of the late Professor Rolleston, whose acquaintance I made when we studied medicine together in the school of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, whose friendship I enjoyed uninterruptedly for a period of thirty years, and for whose talents, learning, and per- sonal character I entertain the highest respect and esteem.

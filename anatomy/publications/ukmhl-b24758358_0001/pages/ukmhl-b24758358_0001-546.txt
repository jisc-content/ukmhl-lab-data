REPORT ON THE FAUNA OF A CRANNOG AT LOCHLEE, TARBOLTON, AYRSHIRE K Among the bones submitted to me by Robert Munro, M.D., Kilmarnockj and reported as having been procured from a Crannog- at Lochlee, the following* animals have their skeletons repre- sented :— The ox, Bos long\frons.—No proof of the presence of the wild variety. The pig*, Sus scrofa, variety domestica.—I am not clear that the wild variety is represented here any more than in the specimens of the preceding- species. (One fragment might have belonged to a wild individual, the molar No. 3 in it having all the pinnacles and eminences which have given to the teeth of the Suidae, as to the whole division of non-ruminant Ariodactyles, the name Buno- dontj worn away, and having its grinding surface consequently reduced to one single, however sinuous, continent of dentine bounded by enamel.) As is well known ^, the bones of an ill- tended and ill-fed, self-providing, so-called domestic pig, come to be very like the bones of a thoroughly wild pig ; whilst, on the other hand, it is also well known that very great valuations exist as to size within the limits even of the wild varieties Sus scrofa. But in the series now before me there is only one fragment, con- sisting of the part of the lower jaw which carries the last molar, * [In 1878 a Crannog at Lochlee was excavated and a description was given by Dr. Robert Munro to the Society of Antiquaries in Scotland, and published in their Pro- ceedings, 1880. The Report on the animal remains found in the course of the excava- tions was furnished by Professor Rolleston.—Editor.] * See Nathusius, ' Schweineschiidel,' 1864, p. 147; Riitimeyer, 'Basel Gesell.

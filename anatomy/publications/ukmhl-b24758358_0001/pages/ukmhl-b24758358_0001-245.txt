XIIL ON THE VAEIOUS FOEMS OF THE SO-CALLED 'CELTIC CRANIUM. Pkofessou NilssoNj eighteen years ago, declared that he con- sidered nothing more vague and uncertain than the form of the Celtic cranium^; and Professor Ecker^ has expressed himself in much the same language as to the Roman cranium: the latter of these two authors, however, has done much towards removing some of the uncertainty of which he complains. Upon these two points I should wish here to make a few remarks. Under the head of pre-Roman skulls, found in Britain, most writers would be agreed that three distinct types may be classedâ€”as the ' River-bed' type of Professor Huxley, the brachycephalic type of Dr. Thurnam, and the dolichocephalic ' pre-Celtic type ' of the same author. I have to say that a dolichocephalic cranium, distinct from the dolichocephalic Celtic cranium found in the long barrows, exists in addition to these three types, with the latter of which, I believe, it is sometimes con- founded. Representatives of this type of crania may be found in a cast in the easily accessible Museum of the London College of Sur- geons, and in another cast^ made by Dr. Thurnam, and now widely circulated, of a cranium procured by me, through the kindness of J. C. Athorpe, Esq., from a barrow near Dinnington, in South Yorkshire; and, finally, in no less than thirty-two crania or calvaria, which the inexhaustible civility of William Aid worth, Esq., has enabled me to procure from an all but equally inexhaustible cemetery on his estate at Frilford. First, of the cast in the College of Surgeons; in the Catalogue of the Osteological Series it may be found described thus at No. 5709 : ' A plaster cast of * 'Crania Eritannica,' Letter to Dr. Thumam, p. 17.

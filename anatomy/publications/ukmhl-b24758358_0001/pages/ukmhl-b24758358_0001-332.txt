GENEEAL EEMAEKS 243 bone to the other, must have put the men of the round-barrow time into even sharper contrast with the surviving descendants of the men of the stone and bone ages. The eyebrows in the powerful men of the later period, if developed at all in cor- respondence with the large underlying frontal sinuses and supra- orbital ridges, must have given a beetling and probably even for- bidding appearance to the upper part of the face, whilst the boldly outstanding and heavy cheek bones must have produced an im- pression of raw and rough strength and ponderosity entirely in keeping with it. Overhung at its root, the nose must have projected boldly forwards, not merely beyond the plane of the forehead^ but much beyond that of the prominent eyebrows them- selves. In some cases, but not by any means in so many as might a priori have been expected, the somewhat lengthy upper jaw had its anterior or incisive segment projecting so as to constitute alveolar prognathism, whilst the sockets of the canines and those teeth themselves attained such a development as to give a somewhat square appearance to the jaw when viewed from in front. The lower jaw, which in every well-marked variety of the human species contributes very importantly towards the making up of its distinctive character, was in the brachycephalous Briton usually a very different bone from the lower jaw of his Silui'ian predecessor. Its chin was prominent, and contributed a greater proportion to the entire depth of the bone in front than the alveolar portion. Its ramus might not be thicker and stouter than the ramus of the other variety with which it is compared, but as the eye follows the lower line of two such lower jaws along to their angle the superior strength of the later type is made manifest, not merely by the muscular markings and eversion of the angle, but by the much greater width of the entire bone at this point. We may now pass from the brachycephalic British skull of the bronze * period, leaving some of its minor characteristics to be gathered in the way of contrast from the ensuing general descrip- tion of the dolichocephalic variety, and summing up the general impression which an inspection of a series of such skulls makes upon an observer by saying that it suggests the application of such epithets as ' well-filled,^ 'eurycephalic,' 'sub-cubical;' or when the rounding-off effect of senile change has begun to tell, * subsphe-

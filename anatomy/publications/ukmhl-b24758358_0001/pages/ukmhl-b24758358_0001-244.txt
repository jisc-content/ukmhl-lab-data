154) NOTES ON THE POST-MORTEM EXAMINATION, ETC. noted in persons undoubtedly centenarian, may, by the very fact of their being many, lend some probability to it. Taken singly, they have little weight, their evidence is cumulative. Perhaps even standing alone, the diminution of the mass of the blood and of the blood-making organs—the spleen and the mesenteric glands—may be considered as some proof of great age. The dilatation of the aorta and the outgrowing of the prostate are frequently, yet not constantly nor exclusively, noticeable senile changes. The pathological alterations which the heart, lungs, liver and kidneys had undergone impair any evidence which might possibly have been based upon their weights. The pancreas I did not weigh, through inadvertence^. Many other omissions will be noted in my account of this examination; some, however, such as that of the weight of the body, were owing, not to inadvertence, but to other causes, which I need not specify. * I may say that M. Durand-Fardel is wrong in saying (1. c. p. xxi), ' Le pancreas est, suivant Canstatt, de toutes les glandes celle dont la metamorphose atrophique s'observe le plus souvent cliez les vicillards.' Canstatt's words are, ' Atrophische Ver- wandlung in hohen Alter nicht selten isC (Tome i. p. 69.) This correction may, I hope, save some one certain trouble, which M. Durand-Fardel's erroneous statement caused me to undertake.

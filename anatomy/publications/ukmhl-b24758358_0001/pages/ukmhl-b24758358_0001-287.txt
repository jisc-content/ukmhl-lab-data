No skulls resembling them in their distinctive characters have come into my hands from any British burial-place belonging to the Stone Age, On the other hand, there is no doubt that this variety of the brachycephalic skull has survived and is represented amongst us in modern days. Dr. Beddoe ^, for example, and Professor Virchow^, have both specially remarked upon the likeness borne by certain modern Danish heads to some of the ancient Borreby crania; and their characteristics are even exaggerated in a pre- sumably modern cranium figured by M. Topinard in his L'Anthro- pologie, 1876, p. 298, fig. 37. A few references have been given above, pp. 176, 177 note, to memoiTS bearing upon the production of cranial defonnities artificially though undesignedly.

XVIII. ON THE PEOPLE OF THE LONG-BAEEOW PEEIOD. Introductory Remarks.-^ln this paper I propose to give in detail a descriotion of the examination of three long barrows situated near the little village of Nether Swell, in the county of Gloucester, prefacing this account by some general remarksâ€”firstly, as to the physical characteristics of the people of the long barrow period; secondly, as to the possibility of dividing that period into successive epochs ; and thirdly, as to the rationale of the various modes of dis- posing of the dead observable in those early tumuli. In these prefatory remarks I shall not confine myself to the facts observed in the Gloucestershire explorations, but shall use, for purposes of comparison, my records of the investigation of similar barrows carried on by me in Yorkshire and elsewhere, with the valuable assistance of Canon Greenwell. Looking at the osteological remains as a whole, perhaps the most striking point is the great disproportion in the sizes and the lengths of certain of the long bones, and, by consequence, in heights, of the male and female skeletons respectively. The male skeletons were very ordinarily about 5 feet 6 inches in height, as against a height of but 4 feet 10 inches attained to by the female. The average difference between the statures of males and females in civilised races is about half this amount, whilst a precisely similar disproportion is observable at the present day between the stature of individuals of the two sexes amongst savages The clavicles ' The late Sir Andrew Smith, K.C.B., informed me, that from extensive obaerva- tiona, carried on for a period of seventeen years, in South Africa, he could assui-e me that the Amakosa Kaffirs to the eastward of the colony averaged near 5 feet Sj inches, women 5 feet ^ inch. (See ' Archaeologia,' 1870, vol. xlii. p. 457, where I put this observation, and a number of other measurements bearing upon this point, on record.) A a

438 NOTES ON SKELETON FOUND AT CISSBURY. shall very rarely fail in tlie lower races of mankind to find the former of these distances much exceed the latter; and it is certainly only in the lower jaws of the hig-her races that we find the opposite proportion to prevail. So that if it were not wearisome to add to the list of indices, an anteroposterior index might be established for comparing the relative proportions of the two segments of the usually curved line described by the posterior surface of the symphysis. The length from the foramen specified to the alveolar edge of the symphysis is in the female jaw i-i inch as against -85 inch in the male, whilst the distance from the same foramen to the mental border of the symphysis is in the female jaw -6 inch as against - J inch in the male. The following general conclusions appear to be deducible from the foregoing descriptions and comparison of the two Cissbury skeletons :â€” Firstly, that from the osteological peculiarities either of the cranium or of the lower jaw, or of the trunk and limbs, or of the skelelon as a whole, arguments of considerable cogency may be drawn for or against the ' priscan' date of a human skeleton, independently of the arguments to be drawn from its archaeological surroundings. Secondly, that in skeletons proved to be priscan by both the above lines of argumentation, points of diflPerence will still be found to exist, independent on the one hand of points of sexual difFerencCj and in spite, on the other, of any tendencies to uni- formity, which the supposed uniformity of priscan life may be thought likely to produce.

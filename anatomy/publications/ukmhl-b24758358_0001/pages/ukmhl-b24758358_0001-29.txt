LIFE OF DR. ROLLESTON. xxi one of the lady nurses, slight as they are, may give an idea of what he seemed to others. 'During the nine months that I spent in the Hospital at Smyrna, I nursed almost exclusively under him in the Division confided to Dr. Leared's and his care, so that I had constant opportunities for understanding his fine character, so full of talent and energy, so kind, and with so much earnestness beneath his playful manner.

Can anything speak more strongly for our organisation and sanitary condition? The English have put unbounded means at the disposal of the authorities everywhere throughout the Levant; we, here at Smyrna, have made use of them, and the results will justify the expenditure.

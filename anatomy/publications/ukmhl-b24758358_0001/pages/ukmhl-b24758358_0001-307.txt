The parietal tubera are well marked, and one of them is the seat of an exostosis; the walls of the skull below widen only very slig-htty as they pass down to the mastoids ; the point however of maximum width lies below that of the parietal tubera and on a level with the posterior and superior angle of the squamous. A dilatation in the line of an accidental fissure running about midway between the upper and lower borders of the left parietal bone marks the exact position of the parietal tuberosity of that side; which, as is the rule in skulls of this type, is seen to be both further forward and lower down than it, with the part of the brain which it covers (for which see Husehke, 1. c. p. 142), would be in brachy- cephalic forms. The upper lineae seraicirculares for the origin of the temporal muscles are plainly seen above the parietal tubera. WEAVERTHORPE. [xliv. 3. p. 198.] The calvaria and lower jaw, ' Weaverthorpe, xliv. 3,' may firstly be taken to illustrate the fact that a type existed in the Bronze Period which is recognisable amongst modern Celtic populations; and, secondly, may throw some light upon the various

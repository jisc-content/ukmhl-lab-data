101 AND THOSE OF CERTAIN OTHER MAMMALIA. In therefore the deeiduate mammalia, or, in other words, in those mammalia in which the foetal placenta brings away with it always certain maternal elements inextricably interfused with its mass, and very commonly certain other maternal elements also in the form of a superposed layer of deciduous serotina, we find that, by looking to the three following points—fiirstly, to the extent of vascularity which the chorion possesses, secondly, to sources whence this vascular supply comes, and, thirdly, to the relation which the ultimate capillary ramifications of the umbilical vessels hold to the maternal blood-vascular system-—we can make four classes well established and acknowledged upon quite other prin- ciples of division, viz. the Simiadae, the Insectivora, the Rodentia, and the Carnivora. The persistence of the allantois as a sac seems to be a variable character within the limits of single classes ; but its relations to the amnios within and to the secondary chorion without appear, in this as well as in the non-deciduate division of mammals, to furnish good classificatory indications. The development of a decidua reflexa is probably constant in the Simiadae ; it is variable in extent in the Rodents and probably also in the Insectivora, and it is virtually absent in the Carnivora, In the Rodents alone does the yelk-sac assume any physiological importance, and this it does by virtue of the omphalo-mesenterie vessels it carries, and at the cost of its.sac-character. In the other classes it is found, at the end of the period of gestation, to retain this character, the structure being in a more or less atrophied condition. The second division in Professor Weber's binary classification of Mammals corresponds, if we exclude the Edentata provisionally, and include, with perhaps more confidence, the Sirenia\ exactly with the Ungulata and Mutica of Linnaeus, and with the Artio- dactyla, and Perissodactyla, and Mutilata of Professor Owen's classification in the Linnean Society's ' Proceedings.'' Of all these animals alike it may be predicated that at parturition the villi of the chorion separate themselves from the maternal structures, in which previously they were ensheathed, without bringing away ' [The diffused arrangement of the villi on the chorion of the Dugong has been ascertained by Paul Harting.

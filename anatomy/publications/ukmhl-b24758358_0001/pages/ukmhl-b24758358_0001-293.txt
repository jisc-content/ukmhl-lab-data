LANGTON WOLD. 203 for such bones tbe name of' (6nmvs a colonnes' (Topinard, ' L'An- thropolog-ie,' p. 324, 1876). This skull, and the one next to be described, Duggleby i. 2, may be taken as typical representatives of the male and female form respectively of the Plohberg type of His and Riitimeyer as described and figured in the ' Crania Helvetica' of those authors. There can be no doubt as to the respective sexes and ag-es of these two skulls, the trunk and limb-bones of both having- been available for examination as well as the crania, thoug-h many of both sets of bone in both cases have suffered considerably from posthumous injury, and have to be spoken of as reconstructed. There are several modifications of the dolichocephalic type found in barrows of the Neolithic Period which do not correspond with the Hohberg type just mentioned; that type however is found in those barrows, and these skulls, though of a later date, very fairly represent it, and their respective sexes being certainly fixed they enable us to distinguish in this type the characters which have an ethnographical from those which have merely a sexual significance. The skull, Langton Wold i, is distinctly and essentially ortho- gnathous, as shown by comparison of the basi-cranial with the basio-subnasal and basio-alveolar lengths; the supraciliary ridges owe their large size to the masculine character of the skeleton they belong to, they meet, however, as these ridges are said to do in this type by the ethnologists just referred to, without that depression in the middle glabellar line which is usual in the brachycephali; the median vertical contour describes the characteristically equable dolichocephalic curve from the point where the glabella sinks into the oblique facies frontalis of the os frontis to the centre of the su- perior squama occipitis, where a spot ^^'^ anterior to the upper side of the external occipital protuberance, and -^^'^ anterior to the com- mencement of a linea nuchae mediana, separated by a slight interval from that largely developed ridge, marks the back of the skull. This occipital dolichocephaly, plain enough also on simple inspection, is further made manifest by its low antero-posterior index, 45, though it is right to say that the skull has probably undergone some compression with the usual result of producing a lengthening, and in this case owing to its intrinsic wall-sidedness in the temporal and parietal regions, especially in the posterior half of the skull.

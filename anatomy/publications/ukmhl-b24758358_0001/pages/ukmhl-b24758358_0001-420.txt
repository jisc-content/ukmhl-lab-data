APPENDIX. 330 ' balauus capillis' and the ' balanatum gausape,' finer ware than that of these diminutive amphorae would, I think, have been used, for finer ware is usually present in abundance in such collections, and was, as I have noted, 1. c, specially abundant in the case specified; whilst, as was pointed out to me by Mr. Wm. Hatchett Jackson, of the University Museum, small jars of much the same contour, if not of the same paste, are still largely used in the honey trade of Narbonne. The sale of honey was amongst the ' patrias artes' of the Ligurian of the times of Diodorus and Strabo and fashions and patterns which have once been in vogue in such trades are often very persistent. Strong evidence of the literary and historical kind (q. v.) is brought forward by Mr. J. Thrupp, in his interesting article on the ' Domes- tication of Animals in England' (' Trans. Ethn. Soc. London,' 1865, New Series, vol. iv. p. 169), in favour of the conclusion that ' in the sixth and seventh centuries bees were altogether wild' in this country. The history of the words used for ' hive' appears to show that the first step towards the domestication of the bee by the English was ' the formation of imitations in bark (rusca, see Ducange, sub voc.) of the hollows of the trees in which they were found.' About the middle of the tenth century we read of Anglo-Saxon ' beo-churls;' and we find ' the Anglo- ' Diodorus (v. 34) writes thus of the Celtiberians (in the connection abeady referred to, p. 635 supra) : Ipocpats Si xpuivraL Kpiaai iravToSanoTs Koi Sa\pt\fai Kal oivofitkiros ■nofxarL, xopvy°^'^V^ '''V^ x*^?"' t6 ixf\t irafiirXridts. It may be an overstraining of the words to suggest that the six last quoted may be considered to indicate that wild rather than hive honey was in the mind of the writer. The words of his contemporary Strabo are in a parallel passage (iv. 6, 2, p. 168, ed. Miiller, 1853) to the following eflfect:— A(7i'€y, ^SivTfS airb 0pffifj.a.r<iiv iT\fov ml faXaKTOs Kai Kpid'ivov TrSiiaTos, vtp.6ixtvoi to T€ irpbs OaKa.TT'Q, x<i"pi'a ico-l to -nkiov tA oprf . . vKtjv ■nannoWrjv vavm^yrjaiijiov icai fit- ■yak6SfvSpov . . .

Gesell. Zurich,' Rapp. vi. Pfahlbauten, p. 34, suggests that the straining of honey off the comb may have been the use to which were put such perforated dishes as that figured by Keller, I.e., taf v. fig. 26, p. 270, or ed. Lee, pi. lii. B, fig. 1. See also D^sor, ' Le Bel Age du Bronze,' p. 12, fig. 22, and Schliemann, ' Trojanische Alterthiimer,' tab. 174, fig. 3377- Usually such perforations are held to have been intended for filtering whey off curds, in accordance with the Homeric words, Od. ix. 222, 223 :— VaTov S' 6p^ ayyea iravra TavXoi Tt (TKaflSei Tf TeTvyfieva. But we may suppose that in such descriptions as this we have traditions of a much earlier period than those we are here concerned with, preserved for us. It is right however to add that Herr Edmund v. Fellenberg, 'Bericht uber die Pfahlbauten des Bielersees, S. A. 1875,' pp. 55-61, suggests yet another application, that of fumi- gation, for these vessels. Honey however is so strained in certain Swiss valleys at the present day.

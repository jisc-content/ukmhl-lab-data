X. ON THE PLACENTAL STEUCTURES OF THE TENREC (CENTETES ECAUDATUS) AND THOSE OF CERTAIN OTHER MAMMALIA; WITH REMARKS ON THE VALUE OF THE PLACENTAL SYSTEM OF CLASSIFICATION. Having, through the kiudness of Alfred Newton, Esq., F.Z.S,, come into possession of a female tenrec [Gentetes ecaudatns), I pro- pose to lay before the Society a description of its generative organs, and of certain foetal structures which, were found in connexion with them. To this I shall append descriptions of the homologous structures in several other mammalia, comparing them mfer se, as well as with what I believe will prove to be the unique modifications of the placenta in the tenrec; and throughout the paper I shall keep in view the bearing which the facts detailed may have upon the morphological value of differences in the structure of the placenta. I. Female Generative Organs. The uretliro-sexual and anal outlets open within a single ori- fice, on either side of which there is a saucer-shaped depression, such as exists within the rabbit, underlain by a cluster of all but sessile glands, with which racemose anal glands, possessing ex- cretory ducts converging to one common pedicle, co-exist. The urethro-sexual canal is seven-eighths of an inch in length ; its walls are smooth internally, and it receives on either side the duct of a Duvernoy gland. The vagina is divisible into two portions, the lower part of the tube being smooth and patent internally, whilst the upper has its canal more or less perfectly obliterated by the interlocking of inwardly growing transverse processes of its

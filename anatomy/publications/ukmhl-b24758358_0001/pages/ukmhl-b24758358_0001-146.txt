60 ON COKRELATIONS OF GROWTH, WITH A SPECIAL EXAMPLE 1 ' Origin of Species,' pp. 145, 197, ist edit.; pp. 162, 217, 3rd edit. inter-maxillaries, or of the representatives of the Polian vesicles in the Arenicola. But many of Mr. Paget's instances cannot be brought under this head, and constituted as our minds are, we cannot but read them as he has done. Mr, Darwin, on the other hand, himself admits ^ that there are many instances of correlated growth of which our reason can give no rationale, either as subserving ends, or as conforming to type, or as speaking of parentage, or as working up into structure what would else be waste and excretor}^; for which in other words it can assign neither final, nor formal, nor material cause. I would in- stance, in addition to those he brings forward, the correlations of growth witnessed in Morbus caeruleus betwixt a malformation of the heart and a clubbed adunque state of the finger-nails, and in Morbus Addisoni betwixt disorganised supra-renal capsules and pig- mentary skin-discolouration. Unable to rationalise, we class such phe- nomena as these under the wide head of ' Correlations of Growth.' The very vagueness of the phrase prevents us from even momentarily deluding ourselves with the idea that it amounts to an explanation, and to more therefore than an expression of facts. It cannot be accused of striving to conceal the flimsiness of its thought by a magnificent display of archaic words, as certain exchequers would fain conceal their bankruptcy from the world by a copious issue of paper-money. Herein lies its great merit. On a future occasion I shall consider the nature of the hyber- nating glands, if so they may be called, of certain hybernating and non-hybernating Insectivora and Chiroptera, and the possibility of classing them as growths tautogeueous with the highly-developed mesenteric and cervical lymphatic glands found in so many of those creatures. And before concluding I would mention yet another class of structures, the existence of which admits of being rationalised upon yet another principle. These structures, fixed and settled in the adult organism, speak of a time when the sex was as yet unfixed and unsettled in the developing embryo, and accessory organs of either kind were, if so we may say, prepared so as to be in readiness to meet either event. The mammary glands, the Weberian organ, and the cysts of Morgagni of the adult male, the round ligament

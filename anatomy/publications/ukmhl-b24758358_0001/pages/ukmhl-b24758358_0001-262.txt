For a description of senile chang-es iu the cranium, may be con- sulted Welcker, 'Archiv fiir Anthropologic,' i. p. 119, 1866; Virchow, ' Verhandlungen Phys. Med. Gesellschaft zu Wiirzburg,' iv. 354j 1853, 'Ueber die Involutionskrankheit (Malum senile) der platten Knochen, namentlich des Schadels,' or ' Gesamm. Abhand.' p. 1010 sqq., 1856 ; Lucae, ' Schadel abnorm. Form,' xiii. and xiv, P- 3i> 1857 ; and Cleland, ' Phil. Trans.' pp. 136, 160, 162, 1870. The 'basilar angle' of Professor Broca, taken in the manner recommended by him (' Revue d'Anthropologie,' ii, 3. p. 202, 1873; 'Instructions Craniologiques, Mem. Soc. Anth. Paris,' torn. ii. 2^^ Serie, 1875, pp. 90-93, or Topinard, 'L'Anthropologic,' pp. 54, 307, 1876), has been added to some of the lists of measurements. It ex- presses well in the inverse ratio of its numbers the greater or less extent of the cranial curvature or antero-posterior arch described by the cerebral hemispheres. Its rationale is well illustrated by such figures as those given by Ecker, 'Archiv fiir Anthropologic,' iv. 1870, p. 301, fig. 39, p. 303, fig. 40, and by the figures in the two plates appended to that paper, ' Ueber die verschiedeue Kriimmung des Schadelrohres und iiber die Stellung des Schadels auf die Wirbelsaule beim Neger und beim Europaer.' The same indication is given in a less precise way by placing a skull with the grinding surface of its upper-jaw teeth upon a flat surface and then observing whether it is the occipital condyles or the conceptacula cerebelli which furnish a support to the back part of the skull when it is brought down on to that surface. This method however of estimating the extent of cranial curvature is not rarely likely to mislead us. For in skulls of adults, and especially of male adults, the occipital condyles are often found to have increased considerably in a downward direction; and such skulls may then come, when placed as above directed, to rest upon them, owing, not to any deficiency in the cranial curvature or length of the brain, but simply to this outgrowing of the condyles which is developed in aid of the maintenance of the balance of the

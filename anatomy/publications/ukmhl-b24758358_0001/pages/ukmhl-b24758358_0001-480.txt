390 ON THE PEOPLE OP THE LONQ-BAKROW PERIOD. This barrow contained four more or less disturbed 'chambers,' or 'cists/ In the case of the first of these receptacles of the dead, which was the one which had suffered most in the way of disturbance, there can be no doubt that the term ' chamber' is the right one to apply to it, as the limitary wall of the barrow formed a passage leading down to it; but in the case of the other three, this passage was not found to exist, and though the end stones, which give a ' cist' its distinctive character—that, namely, of being closed on all sides—were not found in situ, it is easy to understand how they may have been the first to be moved, when the plough was first driven across the barrow, at right angles to the long axis of which they stood. The ' chamber' having been most completely ruined, we can with certainty depose to the presence of no more than two bodies as having been found, represented by fragments in its immediate neighbourhood, and as having, consequently, with some likelihood, been once contained in its interior when intact. One of these had been an adult, one a child, with tlie milk dentition only in place. The bones of the adult were discoloured with manganic oxide, as were those of an ox and horse found with them ; those of the child were not. Of the three other receptacles, ' cists,' or ' chambers/ for the dead, the first examined contained portions of the bodies of two adults and four children, together with the larger part of the skeleton of a young dog, and some other domestic animals' bones. The second contained portions of ten skeletons, all of which, with one exception—the skeleton of a boy or girl—had belonged to adults, whilst the fourth contained only one skeleton, that of a person between twelve and sixteen, with whom a fragment of coarse domestic pottery was found. September 35, Friday.—The first operation in the way of ex- amining this barrow took the shape of cutting a trench across its eastward end, at right angles to its long axis, at a level which subsequent examination showed to be about 8 feet to the westward of the central concavity of the horned eastward end. At about 17 or 18 feet westwards from the centre point of the eastward end were found some bones of a child, with the milk dentition in place, about 2 feet or half-way down in the barrow. Parts also of an ulna, of a tibia, of the phalanges, and of both

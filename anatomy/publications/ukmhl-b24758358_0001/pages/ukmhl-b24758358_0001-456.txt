366 ON THE PEOPLE OF THE LONG-BARROW PERIOD. passages were available ; but that burial without burning-, and also without any cist or chamber whatever, may, in otlier districts not so conditioned, have been contemporaneous with burial in chambers ; and finally, that inhumation in cists without passages leading down to them, and cremation, mark later epochs in the long-barrow period. The questions are in need of further evidence for their definite solution, and they are beset with numerous difiiculties and sources of fallacy. Coming, in the third place, to a consideration of the modes of burial observable in long barrows, and the rationale to be given of them, I have to say that one peculiaritj"- appears to me to charac- terise all long barrows, whether they contain burnt or unburnt bodies, and that this peculiarity is, that whether the number of bodies be large or small, they occupy but a relatively small part of the entire tumulus. In other words, the bony remains, burnt or unburnt, are huddled together in short compass, whilst, so far as we see on the first contemplation of their arrangement, they might have been disposed with little or no more trouble at intervals throughout the tumulus. A segment or two of the entire length of the barrow has been employed for the reception, all the rest has been erected for the honour of the dead. In a long barrow near Market Weighton, containing some twenty-six burnt skeletons, the whole number were found within a distance of 60 feet from its east end ; of these twenty-six, twenty-one were buried in a segment of 32 feet in length, and of these twenty-one, seventeen lay in a length of 17 feet. In another barrow, also of the cremation variety, near Kirkby Stephen, and 179 feet in length, the whole number of burnt bodies amounted only to seven, but they were crowded into a segment of the barrow which was but 3 feet 6 inches wide and la feet 6 inches in length, A chamber 7 feet by 4 feet, in one of the Gloucestershire barrows, ' Swell vii.,' contained, even after having been exposed to rifling by the rustics of the neighbourhood during a period of many years, remnants of no less than nine adult skeletons. Another receptacle which I examined in another barrow (' Swell vi.') close by, and which I believe to have been a cist, though, from its having been disturbed, it is a little unsafe to speak quite positively, contained within a space of 5 feet 6 inches by 4 feet, parts of two adult unburnt skeletons, male and female respectively, parts of three children about seven or eight years of age, and the skeleton

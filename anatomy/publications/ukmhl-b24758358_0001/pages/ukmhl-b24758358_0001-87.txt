I. ON THE AFFINITIES OF THE BEAIN OF THE OEANG UTANG. As an opportunity has quite lately been aflPorded me of dissecting' an Orang' Utang, and as the University Museum possesses a con- siderable number of preparations which illustrate the ' Zoological Relations of Man with the Lower Animals,' it is less presumptuous in me than it otherwise would have been to write upon a subject which has met with such able, as well as such recent handling in the Natural History Review ^. The great attention which the paper to which I allude has attracted, renders it unnecessary for me either to recapitulate the views it propounds, or to specify in detail the points in which I agree, or those in which I feel myself compelled to differ, with the writer of it, whose authority I should be little likely needlessly to dispute. In this paper it will be with human rather than with simious brains that I shall contrast and compare the brain of the Orang Utang; incidentally, however, I shall institute comparisons between the brain of the Asiatic ape, and that of the smaller of the two most anthropoid African apes, the Chimpanzee. Ticdemann and Buffon exemplify, respectivelj'-, the two most opposite views which it is possible to entertain as to the question of the actual anatomical truth, on the one hand, and of the possible anthropological bearings of the former of these two comparisons, on the other. Buffon, writing in 1766, speaks of the brain of the orang in much the same language as Tyson, in his 'Anatomy of a Pygmie,' had, more than sixty years previously, applied to the brain of the chimpanzee. Between these brains and that of man ' ' On the Zoological Relations of Man with the Lower Animals.' By Professor Huxley, 1861,

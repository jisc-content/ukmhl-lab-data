ON HOMOLOGIES OF THE LOBES OF THE LIVER IN MAMMALIA. 73 lodgment of that portion of the stomach : immediately overhung itself by the right subdivision of the suspensory lobe, it again over- lies the ' right kidney lobule/ which is very commonly either deeply fissured or greatly excavated for the reception of the organ after which it is named. The ' superior right lobule' and the ' right kidney lobule' are often found to be fused into one mass in animals such as the hedgehog {Erinaceus eiiropaeus) and the long- eared bat {Plecatus auritus), in which they are usually distinct. Lastly, we have the ' lobulus Spigelii,^ which (with two exceptions in the marsupial series, viz. Phalangista vulpina and the Macropus gigantetis), we have found to be more directly in connexion with, and sessile upon, the 'right kidney lobule' than upon any other portion of the liver. The bile-duct and the aiferent blood-vessels of the liver pass in front of the origin of this lobule. It may effloresce into two processes distally and to the left, one of which may pass before and the other behind the cardiac end of the stomach, as in Mtis decumanus; or it may give off a process near its origin and towards the right, which may interpose itself be- tween the ' right kidney lobule^ and the ' superior right lobule,' as in the shrew [Sorex vulgaris). In the nomenclature suggested by M. Duvernoy ('Ann. des Sciences Naturelles,' ser. ii. torn, iv), the left division of the suspensory lobe is named 'lobe principal gauche,' but its diminished proportions, as compared with those of the ' left lobe' in some of the Insectivora and lower Quadrumana, incline us to consider it as wholly lost in such livers as those of man and the ruminants, and to assign it, when it does exist, to the ' suspensory lobe.' Without, however, positively pronouncing upon its homology, convenience of description induces us to name it ' left suspensory lobule.' It is proposed, then, to speak of the liver as divisible into three principal lobes, two of which frequently admit of further subdivision —at the most, however, into not more than three lobules each :— The ' left lobe.' The ^suspensoiy lobe,' which may f ^ ^"^^ suspensory lobule, be divided into \ ^ '^f''^'^^ suspensory lobule, V a right suspensory lobule. The ' right lobe,' which may be f ^ '"^^fZ ^'^^^ ^^^^^^^^ divided into 1 ^ ''8"^* V a lobulus Spigelii.

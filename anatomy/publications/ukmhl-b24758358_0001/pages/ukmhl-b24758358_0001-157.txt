VIII. THREE ANATOMICAL NOTES AND TWO ANATOMICAL QUERIES. The following points of anatomy, though of no very wide sig- nificance, are nevertheless by no means devoid of interest, and are, I believe, new:— I. The organs of Bojanus open into the pericardial space on either side, in the floor of that space at a point between the outer end of the auricle and the visceral mass in Ostrea and Pecten. It is obvious that this orifice, which in other Lamellibranchiata is drawn out into a funnel-shaped passage, is the representative of the ' pyriform vesicle' of the nudibranchiate mollusca, for which see Hancock, ' Linnasan Society's Transactions,' xxiv. p. 511 (1864). 3. To distinguish the skull of a hare [Lepus timidus) from that of a rabbit (Lepiis cimiculus), several points of dilference may be employed. Perhaps the readiest, and, as I believe, the surest, is the greater complexity of the maxillo-turbinal bones in the latter animal. It is obvious that an animal living very usually in a subterranean atmosphere is advantaged by having that atmosphere warmed as much as possible before entering the lungs. 3. Two of the subungulate rodents—viz. the guinea-pig {Cavia aperea), as shown by Mr. Marshall ('Phil. Trans.' 1850^ p. 151); and the agouti [Basyprocta agtdi)—resemble the ungulata proper, in having but a single vena cava superior. They difier from these larger quadrupeds in possessing clavicles, though, it is true, incom- plete ones. Coelogenys also—another of the subungulate rodents— possesses clavicles. I should be much obliged to any of the readers of the 'Journal of Anatomy and Physiology' who would inform me whether Coelofjenys, HydrocJioerus, and Dolichotis have one or two superior cavae, and whether the two last-named of the five Siiiungit- lala are really entirely devoid of clavicles.

LIFE OF DR. ROLLESTON. Ixii any necessity for the Institute taking the matter up. It seems to me an entirely political one . . . .' The extremely important subject, at what stage in the development of science its results may be wisely brought into contact and it may be conflict with political and social opinions, is thus in Rolleston's view to be managed by keeping science and practice apart as long as may be. Whether he was right or wrong, his judgment must be fairly stated and considered, as based on experience.

V. ON CERTAIN MODIFICATIONS IN THE STRUCTURE OF DIVING ANIMALS. In this communication the Cetacea, in the class Mammalia, were contrasted with the Phocidae, and in the class Aves, the Colymbidae were contrasted with the Cinclidae, as to the degree of modification which their tegumentary^ circulatory, and osseous systems had undergone in adaptation to their aquatic habits. The skin of the seal was less specially modified than that of the whale, and the aberrations from the ordinary mammalian characters which its bones and teeth presented were in like manner less marked than those of the animals with which it was compared. The teeth in the order Seals were often irregular as regarded their number, their implantation, and their permanence in the jaw; and the epiphyses of the vertebrae were often slow to unite with the bodies. All these particularities were instances of correlation of growth existing between the skin and systems as far removed from its direct influence as the osseous and dental; and all these parti- cularities, together with those of the systems with which they were correlated, were much more marked in the whales than in the seals. The seals were well provided with intra-hepatic venous sinuses, but their reservoirs for arterial blood were far inferior in grade of development to those of the cetacea. Little could be said as to difference in the degree of patency in the foramen ovale and ductus venosus in the two subjects of comparison, at least so far as the common seal [PJioca vituUna) and common porpoise [PItocaena comtmmis) might serve as representatives of the two orders. To the rudiments of the foetal vena umbilicalis and ductus Botalli, in both, the same remark applied. The stunted salivary glands of the seals seemed an approximation

II. ON THE AFFINITIES AND DIFFEEENCES BE- TWEEN THE BEAIN OF MAN AND THE BEAINS OF CERTAIN ANIMALS. I HAVE here seven drawingSj some more, some less diagram- matical, in illustration of my subject,â€”'The Affinities and Differ- ences between the Brain of Man and the Brains of certain of the Lower Animals.' The two figures on the sheet numbered L represent dissections of the brain of the dog [Canis fainiliaris) and of the brain of a monkey, the vervet (Cercopitheais lalandii); the brain of the monkey is to the left, that of the dog to the right in the drawing. Sheet II represents similarly preiwed dissections of the brain of man and of the brain of an American marmoset monkey (^Hapale penicillatd), holding the same relative positions as the preceding. These four drawings are intended to illustrate the structures known as the lateral ventricles, and to show, further, what relations of overlapping or of outcropping the lesser, after brain, or cerebellum, may stand in to the upper and larger brain, known as the cerebral hemisphere. They are drawings of dissec- tions made within the last fortnight at the Oxford Museum. The other eight figures are either exact reproductions of figures given in M. Gratiolet's celebrated and authoritative work on the Cere- bral Convolutions 1; or as in the single case of Sheet HI, they are the result of the application to his uncoloured plates of the plan of colouring which Cuvier was wont to employ, and of which M. Gra- tiolet has himself made such excellent use. The object of these eight figures is to make intelligible what in former days was, in no exaggerated metaphor, spoken of as the ' chaos of the convo- lutions,' and to enable us hereby to take a scientific estimate of ' Paris, 1854, Bertrand, Editeur.

THE BLOOD-CORPUSCLES OF THE ANNELIDES. 497 containing- two or three per cent, of alumina was coagulated by a few drops of well-water, and could not he transferred from one glass to another, unless the glass was repeatedly washed out hy distilled wafer, without gelatinising ' The late Professor Max Schiiltze, iu his article in the fii-st number of his ' Archiv fiir Mikroskopische Anatomie' (1865), whilst observing that 'iin Blute ist gewiss keiu Bestandtheil gleichgultig' (p. 36), and discussing the import of the ' Zimmermannsche Korperchen,' adds that they have been left unmentioned in the recent handbooks of microscopic anatomy. It may be worth while, therefore, to supply here certain references to memoirs wliich treat of them, and bodies closely allied to them, and which, with the exception of those by Zimmermann himself, mostly point to their being properly regarded either as arte/acta, or as morbid, or as post-mm-tein products:— Zimmermann.—Rust's 'Magazin fiir GesammteHeilkunde,' 1846-48, Bd. 66, p. 173. Virchow's 'Archiv,' xviii. p. 221, i860. 'Zeitschrift fiir Wiss. Zoologie,' xi. p. 344. Virchow.—'Archiv,' i. p. 389, 1847. ' Cellularpathologie,' 1871, pp. 193-266, where these bodies are spoken of as ' Triimmer und Bruchstiicke alter Blutkorperchen.' Schultze (I.e. 1865, pp. 38-41) recommends further investigation into the nature of the several ' Kornchenbildungeu' in blood, not considering them to be all alike either arte/acta or what Mr. Gulliver has called the ' molecular basis of the chyle.' Bottcher.—^Virchow's 'Archiv,' xxxvi. p. 414 seq., 1866. Hensen.—'Zeitschrift fiir Wiss. Zool.' xi. p. 259. Beale.—'Microscope in Medicine,' 1878, pp. 263-4. Eollett,—Strieker's 'Handbuch,' 1869, p. 300, or p. 413 English translation. The ' minute spherules' described by Mr. Gulliver (' Gerber's General Anatomy,' pp. 10, 23, 24, 25, Appendix, and fig. 268) appeal- to be identical with the ' Zimmer- mamuche Korperchen,' and from his account of them, as also from that given by Martin Barry of the blood, figured by him (' Phil. Trans.' 1. c), we may gather that they are produced in special abundance in altered or altering blood. t

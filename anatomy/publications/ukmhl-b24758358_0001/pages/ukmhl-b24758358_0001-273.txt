The femur of the skeleton to which this skull belonged is 19-1" in lengtli, and has its various ridges, and especially that which is in relation with the insertion of the glutaeus maximus, considerably developed. The humerus is I2'7'" long, and by examination of this bone, of the femur, of the skull, and the lower jaw, we are enabled to say that they belonged to a strong male in the later part of the middle period of life, probably about fifty years of age and 5' 9" in height. In the greater obliquity of its forehead and the larger deve- lopment of its supraciliary ridges this skull differs from the one which precedes it, and forms a connecting link between such skulls as that and the one which is described at pages 190,194, viz.' Rudstone, Ixiii. 9.' The relations between the basi-cranial axis, the basio-subnasal line, and the basio-alveolar respectively, as well as the verticality of the pteiygoids, show that this skull is essentially orthognathous, as His and Riitimeyer in treating of skulls of a similar type, viz. their ' Disentis' type, say Crania Helvetica,' p. 37) all pre-historic

XIV. ON THE WEDDO OF CEYLON. Professou Rolleston exhibited in 1872 to the British Asso- ciation, Section of Biology, ten photographs of the Jungle Weddo, taken by B. F. Hartshorne, Esq., as also three skulls of the same tribe procured by the same gentleman, and some skulls of certain Kolarian tribes procured by H. Duthoit, Esq., of Mirzapore, and exhibited for the sake of comparison with those of the Ceylon aborigines. There was no doubt about the genuine- ness of the three Weddo skulls; yet one of the three was as markedly brachycephalic (the cephalic index being 81) as the others, or as Weddo skulls usually, were dolichocephalic. The cephalic indices in the two other skulls, procured from the district of the Jungle Weddo, a tribe now numbering, in all probability, little over 100 persons, were 70 and 76. In three other Weddo skulls, two of which had been obtained by Lieutenant Perkins for Canon Greenwell, and the third had been presented by Mr. Sabonnadiere to the Oxford University Museum, the cephalic indices were respectively 72, 68, and 64. The cubic capacity in each of the two dolichocephalic crania sent by Mr. Hartshorne was 85-25 cubic inches and 80 cubic inches respectively; the cubic capacity of the single brachycephalic specimen was, approximatively, 69 cubic inches. It was of importance to note that synostosis could have had nothing to do with the bringing about of the aberrances of the brachycephalic Weddo cranium, for the coronal suture was open whilst the sagittal was obliterated, the very condition which, if the shape of the skull had ruled the shape of the brain instead of the reverse, would have produced dolicho- cephaly. The presence of parietal occipital flattening on the left side (a deformity unintentionally produced during early life by the mode of carrying the infant) was also noteworthy as being rarely observed except in brachycephalous skulls. With reference to the M

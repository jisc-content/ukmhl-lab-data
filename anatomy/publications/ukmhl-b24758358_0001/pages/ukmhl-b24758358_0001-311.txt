It has suffered very much from posthumous pressure, and the measurements given of it must be taken as being merely approximative. Still, there is abundant evidence furnished by its form in its present condition for saying that it formed part of an exaggeratedly dolichocephalic skull to which the name ' cymbocephalic,' proposed by Professor Daniel Wilson^ in 1850, may very appropriately be applied. No limb nor trunk bones have been assigned to this calvaria, and some doubt may exist as to the sex of its owner ; it is most probable perhaps ' See ' British Association Eeport for 1850,' p. 142.

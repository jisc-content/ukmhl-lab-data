459 LOCHLEE, TARBOLTON, AYRSIIIKE. in the red-deer is known as the sur-rojal antler, to be anything- but a rein-deer's. Writing- for Scottish readers, I need not refer to Dr. J. A. Smith's paper ' On Remains of the Reindeer in Scotland,' read before the Society of the Antiquaries of Scotland, June 14, 1869, vol. viii. pt. i. pp. 186-233, nor to his references in that exhaustive memoir to preceding- writers. But I may mention an additional reference which Dr. J. A. Smith—not being- gifted with as much second- sight as he is with insight—could not have then referred to, as it is contained in a book of more recent date than is his paper. This reference will be found in Dr. Joseph Anderson's edition of the ' Orkneyinga Saga,' chap. vi. p. 183. Regarding a subsequent consignment of bones and horns sent to Professor Rolleston, he writes as follows:—■ The only remark which I feel called upon to make relates to the bones and the teeth of the pig; the marrow cavity in the lower jaw of one of the pigs, a young specimen, containing^ a large quantity of crystals, and the teeth of the older pigs showing a great deal of wear for the teeth of what were, I think, domesticated swine. The crystals were analysed by W. W. Fisher, Esq., of the Chemical Department in the Oxford Museum, and found to be vivianite, as supposed. It is not uncommon to have bones from prehistoric ' finds' which have been much acted on either by fire or water, thus coloured by double decomposition of the bone phosphate with some iron salt furnished either from the bone and flesh or otherwise. The horns (all the washed ones in the collection) received a few days ago are all of red-deer {Cervus elapJms) except one, which is of Cervm cajireohis. With this consignment came one bone, or rather the ulna and radius of a Bos longifrons more or less fused into one bone. The horn of the roe is rather a large one.

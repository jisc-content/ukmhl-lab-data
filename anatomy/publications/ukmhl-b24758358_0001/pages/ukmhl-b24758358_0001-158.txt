IX. ON THE HOMOLOGIES OF THE LOBES OF THE LIVER IN MAMMALIA. • In descriptions of the internal anatomy of rare animals, it is usually easy, even without the aid of figures, to compare the accounts given of the arrangement of their organs with the arrangement of similar structures in animals more familiar to us. To this statement the descriptions given of the lohes and lobules of a multifid liver form an exception; and the purport of this paper is to furnish the zoologist with a convenient and readily applicable system of nomenclature for the several divisions which the liver may be found to present in the mammalian series. The umbilical vein of the foetus, preserved for us in the adult in the so-called ' suspensory ligament,' furnishes us with our first landmark. The lobe to which it is attached we may call the ' suspensory lobe ;' it is very commonly, though not in the human subject, trifid,—the suspensory ligament having one lobule to its left, sub-equal with a second to its right, which is bounded in that direction by the cystic fossa where the gall-bladder exists, and this second lobule, the ' suspensory central,' having the third lobule lying upon the right, between the indentation (when it exists) for the gall-bladder and the free right edge of the entire lobe. The ' suspensory lobe' overhangs the two other lobes into which the mammalian liver is divisible. To the left it overhangs a lobe which is very rarely if at all deeply incised or indented; this lobe we would call the ' left lobe.' The lobe which it overhangs to the right is very frequently lobulated somewhat complexly. This ' right lobe ' is divisible into three secondary lobules, the ' superior right lobule,' the 'right kidney lobule,' and the 'lobulus Spigelii.' The ' superior right lobule' is frequently in relation with the pylorus, and in some animals, as the rabbit, is deei% excavated for the

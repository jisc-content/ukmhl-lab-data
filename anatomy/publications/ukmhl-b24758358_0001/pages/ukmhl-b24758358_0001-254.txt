DESCRIPTION OF FIGURES OF SKULLS. 164 angles to this vertical line will pass at a slightly variable distance above the floor of the nostrils, and will be found ordinarily, though not invariably, to be parallel with the horizontal plane which would be obtained from a consideration of the visual axis, or from the direction of the fronto-ethmoidal suture as proposed by Professor Goodsir^ or from a horizontal surface touching the skull at its occipital condyles and at the posterior border of its occipital foramen, as proposed by Professor Cleland ^. The principal measurements taken have been :â€” I. Mea^ixrements of Calvaria. Extreme length. Cubical capacity Fronto-inial length. Extreme breadth. Vertical height. Absolute height. Basi-crauial axis. Circumference. Erontal arc. Parietal arc. Occipital arc. Minimum frontal widtli. Maximum frontal width. Maximum occipital width. II. Measurements of race. Length of face : ' naso-alveolar' line. Breadth of face : interzygomatic line. ' Basio-subnasal' line ' Basio-alveolar' line. Height of orbit. Width of orbit. Length of nose. Width of nose. Lower jaw, interangular diameter. Lower jaw, depth at symphysis. Lower jaw, width of ramus. III. Indices. Length breadth index: 'cephalic index.' Antero-posterior index. Where any of these measurements have been omitted^ it will be understood that the damaged condition of the skull prevented them from being taken. It will be well, as some differences exist in the practice of cranio- graphers as to the exact points whence their measurements are taken, to specify, in cases where such differences have existed, what the points are whence and to which the measurements given in the subjoined descriptions have been taken.

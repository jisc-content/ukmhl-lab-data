XYII. APPENDIX TO THE ACCOUNT OF THE CRANIA OBTAINED FROM BRITISH BARROWS. I HAVE thought it well to put together in an appendix a few remarks *upon the flora and fauna of the prehistoric times with which I have been dealing, with the view of supplementing rather than of summaris- ing the already existing and veiy extensive literature of this subject. Having had numerous opportunities of examining, not merely the col- lected contents of barrows, but the barrows themselves whilst still con- taining them in situ, I have come to feel that the history of the pre- historic flora and fauna may have been somewhat analogous to that of the barrows themselves, and may therefore receive some elucidation from it. Firstly, the barrows survive mainly in parts of the country into which agricultural improvements with their levelling tendencies have not penetrated as thoroughly as they have into less rugged, less hilly, more arable districts. But the same causes which have allowed these sometimes large masses to remain undisturbed may be reasonably supposed to have been equally favourable to the living organisms which were their contemporaries. Secondly, when we come to look at the structure of the barrows in various parts of this country and the character of their manufactured contents, we are impressed with the existence in them of a similarity and uniformity the more striking as it is not paralleled by any very marked similarity in the analogous human creations of the present day; whilst it is reproduced more or less closely in the flora and the domesticated fauna of those localities. The sheep, oxen, and swine of the Scotch and Welsh highlands, even if not as closely alike as are the horned cairns of Caithness, of Gloucestershire, and of the Peninsula of Gower (see p. 303 supra and Article XVIII), are never- theless far from dissimilar; vegetable being more dependent upon in- organic influences than animal life, the flora at present in occupation of those districts may perhaps, when we make allowance for very recent disturbances in the way of planting, be held to be even as exact a re- production of that which occupied them in neolithic times as the pottery of that period found at one end of this country is of the contemporaneous Y

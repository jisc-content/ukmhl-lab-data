XXIV. REPOET ON BONES FKOM CHASTLETON\ I WAS reluctantly obliged to decline to join the excursion to Cliastleton, but I have been favoured with a small box of bones from that pleasant place, of which I will now say a few words. All the bones, with two or three exceptions, are bones of domestic anjmals. The exceptions are constituted by two lower jaws and one upper jaw of the water rat, Arvicola amphibius. These jaws have a certain interest, as they are just the parts which the polecat, Mustela ptitorms, leaves behind—and rightly, as the large rootless molars and the strong incisors of this harmless vegetable-feeding rodent would be a hard thing for his sharp scissorlike teeth. I have found large quantities of these jaws, handfuls in fact, and without exaggeration, in the lairs of polecats. The polecat is a river-haunting riparian animal, but will carry even frogs a long distance away from the marshy places he finds them in. Siis scrofa, varietas domestical is represented by a few incisors. The pig, being a beast familiar to man from the very earliest times, as his solidarity with man in supporting the life-phases of more than one Entozoon shows, is rarely absent from the earliest pre- historic finds of Neolithic times. The cow, Bos (probably) longifrons, is also represented, but scantily. The sheep, Ovis aries, or the goat (there are no differentiating parts * [These bones were obtained during excavations conducted under tlae direction of E. W. Brabrook, F.S.A., Alfred White, F.S.A., and J. E. Price, F.S.A., in the camp at Chastleton, Moreton-in-Marsh, on the confines of Oxfordshire, Gloucestershire, and Worcestershire. Mr. Price states, in the ' Journal of the Anthropological Institute,' vol. X. p. 125, 1881, that the excavations proved the whole of the camp to be of Roman construction. ' There is nothing in the objects found to illustrate a period either earlier or later than the Roman occupation.'—Editor.]

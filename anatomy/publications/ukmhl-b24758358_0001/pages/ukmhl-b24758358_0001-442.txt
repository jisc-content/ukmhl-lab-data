APPENDIX. 352 collections from Schaffis and elsewhere that the small race of swine Sua scrofa, var. palustris, existed there as a wild race; and coupling this with the facts, on the one side, of the exceeding readiness with which this species lends itself to domestication, and on the other side, of the considerable difficulties which attend its transport over great distances in space, I incline to think that this animal may have had a different history from the others just mentioned, and may have been domesticated upon the spot.

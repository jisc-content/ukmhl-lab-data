55 BY THE ZINC CHLORIDE. nccessar3^ Brains, however, like other org-ans, vary very much in their consistence and power of taking" on consistence after death, and the amount of uncertainty which attaches to this latter mode of preserving brains may perhaps be explained otherwise. Thirdly, I have observed in adult human brains, treated with Burnett's solution of zinc chloride, that the larg'er arteries will, if not re- moved sufficiently early, recoil or retract themselves as arteries in a living body will do when cut away from their peripheral ramifi- cations, and so come to imbed themselves in the substance of the convolutions, and thereby channel and disfigure them. In this matter of the expediency of not delaying the removal of the membranes, the nitric acid method coincides with the zinc chloride, (For this, as regards the former method, see Dr. Bevan Lewis, cit. Dr. J. Crichton Browne, on General Paralysis of the Insane, 'West Riding Lunatic Asylum Medical Reports,' vol. vi. 187(5, p. 203.) In conclusion, I may draw attention to the fact that Duvernoy in his Memoir on the Nervous System of the Lamellibranchiata, published with exquisite and accurate illustrations in the ' Me- moires de I'lnstitut,' 1854, p. 8, tells us that he used zinc chloride for his dissections. The specific gravity of Burnett's solution of zinc chloride is about I'343, and it may be used undiluted for the purposes in question. The above method of preserving the brain, which we have for some years carried out in the Oxford Museum, agrees in its essential features with the first stage of the process recently described by Dr. Carlo Giacomini in a communication made to the Royal Academy of Medicine of Turin. (See Abstract in Report on recent memoirs on the Anatomy of the Brain in Journal of Anatomy and Physiology,' Jan. 1879.)

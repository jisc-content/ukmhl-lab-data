XXV. ON THE CEANIOLOGY OF THE BUSHMEN. The following human bones—viz. four skulls, six lower jaws, four cervical vertebrae, one large and one small sized scapula, two small sized and fragmentary humeri, a fragment of a very slight but adult ulna, four cervical vertebrae, and five more or less frag- mentary ribs—have been put into my hands by Mr. C. G. Gates, with information to the effect that tbey had belonged probably to a Bushman horde massacred somewhere between the Tati and Ramaqueban rivers, in S. lat. 20° 54', and long. 27° 42'. With these human bones came some bones of JEqutis {cahallus or zebra?); also of one large ruminant [Bos taxmis or Bos caffer), and one smaller ; and part of the skull of an ostrich [Struthio cameliis^; and, later, the feet-bones of an elephant [Elejjhas africamis). All these bones had been collected by my former pupil, Mr. Frank Gates, of Christ Church, Oxford. The four skulls had not their lower jaws assigned to them ; but to three of them jaws were assignable, which in all probability had really belonged to them, being very exactly coadaptable, to say nothing of their having been sent in company with them and with certain cervical vertebrae. These six lower jaws are by far the most important bones as regards the question of the nationality of the entire 'find.' If, indeed, these half-dozen lower jaws had been brought to me with no other accompaniments and with no other information than that they had been all brought from one spot in Africa, I think I should have been justified in saying that they had belonged to no other known African race than the Khoi-Khoiuj or its central African representative, the Akka. For they all six alike show the following distinctive and eminently significant peculiarities—viz. lowness of coronoid process, smallness of absolute size, and all but complete obsolescence of chin.

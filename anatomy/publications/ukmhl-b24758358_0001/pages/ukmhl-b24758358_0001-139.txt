III. NOTE ON THE PRESEEVATION OF ENCEPHALA BY THE ZINC CHLORIDE. It has long* been known that zinc chloride may be used in conjunction with spirit for the i:)reservation of encephala. Gratiolet in a note at p. 11 of his famous ' Memoire sur les plis cerebraux de I'Homme et des Primates,' 1854, informs us that a certain Parisian modeller, by name Stahl, was in the habit of hardening- brains for modelling, by placing them whilst fresh, and with the membranes adherent, for two or three days in a solution of zinc chloride marking 25Â° on the areometer of Gay-Lussac. Gratiolet, however, does not say that he himself treated brains in this fashion for his own purpose ; if he had so treated them he would have discovered that for purposes of manipulation it is necessary to subject the brain thus acted upon- to an immersion in alcohol. This Professor von Bischoff of Munich pointed out in his Memoir on'Die Grosshirnwindungen des Menschen' Abhandlungen der k. bayer. Akad. der Wiss.^ CI. ii. Bd. x. Abtheil. ii. 1868, p. 401, or ' S. A.' pp. II, 12), stating at the same time that having employed the solution of zinc chloride for twenty-four years for the preserva- tion of subjects for dissection he had observed that the brains of subjects thus injected, and brains simply put into this solution, presented the following advantages for purposes of study. They become more plastic and tough, less liable to chapping and break- ing away in flakes, than brains simply treated with alcohol; but they do require some subsequent supplementary immersion in alcohol of moderate strength to prevent the acid chloride, which at first coagulates, from softening the albuminous substances of the organ. A second, and this not an inconsiderable advantage, is attained by their allowing the pia mater to be stripped away with

DESCRLPTION OF FIGURES OF SKULLS. 208 of comparative narrowness of the transverse diameter of the basis cranii (see Weis- bach, I.e. p. 68), as in some others, childlike characters, will have their parietal tubera relatively prominent; and how ill-filled male skulls in ill-fed races may come to re- semble them in this point. In well-filled male skulls, on the other hand, the prominence of the parietal tubera is lost in the general globosity produced by the widening out of the lower parts of the brain. SHERBURN WOLD. [vii. I. p. 146.] Skull of a woman of from thirty to thirty-five years AND OF 4 FT. 8 IN. IN HEIGHT.

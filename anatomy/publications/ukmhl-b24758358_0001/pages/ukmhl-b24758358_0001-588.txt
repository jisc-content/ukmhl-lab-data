498 XXVII. ON THE DIFFEEENCE OF BEHAVIOUE EXHI- BITED BY INULINE AND OEDINARY STAECH WHEN TEEATED WITH SALIVAEY DIASTASE AND OTHEE CONVEETING AGENTS. The following were the chief results:— 1. Inuline from the Dahlia retains sugar with great tenacity, but by repeated washings it can be freed from that impurity. 2. When thus freed from sugar, it obstinately resists the con- verting influence of salivary diastase. 3. This salivary diastase was obtained from human saliva, and from parotid and submaxillary gland-substance infused with water and buccal mucus. 4. The same salivary diastase instantly converted ordinary starch into grape-sugar. 5. This salivary-gland infusion, however, if made with salivary gland substance from young animals yet sucking, was found to be ineffectual upon ordinary starch. Bidder's researches were in accordance with this. These results led to the two following practical rules:—i. Arti- chokes are little likely to act as a substitute for the potato, as they contain inuline vice starch. 2. Starch foods are useless in the early months of infancy, as salivary diastase at such a period is inactive.

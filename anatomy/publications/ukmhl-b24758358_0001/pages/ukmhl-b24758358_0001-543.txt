XXII. DESCRIPTION OF A HUMAN SKELETON FOUND IN A BAEEOW AT KOCKLEY^ Of the skull and bones sent to me from Roclcley barrow I have to say that they appear to me to have belonged to a strong man of little if anything above 5 feet 5 inches in stature, and considerably past the middle period of life. He had suffered a good deal from the rheumatic exostosis which so commonly plagued the former in- habitants of this country in every grade of life; but on the other hand he appears to have retained his full adult complement of thirty-two teeth to the time of death. It is possible that out of some two or three sockets now filled with eai-th the teeth may have dropped out a short time before the death of their owner; it can, however, have been only a short time, as the sockets are but little absorbed. The teeth are very much worn, in some cases to below the level of the enamel; but there is no indication, except in one case, of any alveolar abscess having followed upon this severe tare and tret. In an ill-fed subject the case would have been very dif- ferent, as Mr. Mummery has shown in his paper on ''Dental Caries,' in the 'Transactions of the Odontological Society of Great Britain,' November, 1869, vol. ii. pp. 47, 51, 54, 60^ 63. As regards the affinities of the owner of the skull, I should, if allowed to speculate upon the evidence furnished by the osteological remains only, say that we have here one of the hybrids produced by the intercrossing of the tall brachycephalic bronze folk with the short but dolichocephalic race of the long barrow—and stone with ' [In August 1879, the Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Society were present at the opening of an early British bowl-shaped barrow, on the estate of W, H. Tanner, Esq., of Eockley. An account of the opening was given by H. Cunnington, Esq., in the Proceedings of the Society, and the skeleton was described by Professor Rolleslon.—Editor.]

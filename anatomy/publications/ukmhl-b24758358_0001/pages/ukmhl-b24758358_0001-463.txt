ON THE PEOPLE OF THE LONG-BAEROW PERIOD. 373 I will now commence a detailed account of the examination of three long- barrows, situated near the villnge of Nether, or Lower Swell, near Stow-on-the-Wold, in the county of Gloucester. Three persons, the Rev. David Royce, Canon Greenwell, and myself, were concerned in their examination. A large part of the investigation of the barrow first explored, and hereinafter spoken of as Swell i., was superintended by Mr. Royce alone, in the years 1867 and 1868; and to his report of what he observed in it I am greatly indebted for much of what relates to its structure. To his zeal and intelligence, exercised for a period of no less than eight years, we owe the preservation not only of valuable records of facts, but of many osteological and other relics which might otherwise have been scattered and lost. To Canon GreenwelFs suggestions and advice, as well as to his very efficient help in other ways, and notably in the examination of the third barrow (Swell vii.) at (p. 622) a translation from ' Les Bardes Bretons,' relating to the death of Kendelann, puts in italics the following words :—'Son squelette shche encore au coin dufeu.' And in commenting upon them he says :—' Est-ce h, dire que les Bretons eussent conserve jusqu'alors le vieil usage, ddcrit par Strabon, de faire dessdcher les os de leurs parents et de les garder dans un coffre au coin du feu domestique 1' I have; not succeeded in verifying this quotation, which appears to have exceedingly important bearings on the subject of ossuaries, or at least upon that of the practice of keeping the dead body accessible for some time after death, a proceeding which terminates usually in its removal to an ossuary. The following references to statements as to the use of ossuaries in ancient and modern times may be found useful:— Phineas Fletcher, 'Eclogues,' p. 10, ed. 1771, i2mo. G.

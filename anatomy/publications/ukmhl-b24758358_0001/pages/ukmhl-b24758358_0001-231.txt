XIL NOTES ON THE POST-MOKTEM EXAMINATION OF A MAN SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN ONE HUNDKED AND SIX YEARS OLD. A TVTAN, reputed to liave been in his 107th year, died at Oxford, on Thursday, September iith, 1862. By the kind offices of Mr. Tyerman, who has published an account of his life \ I was enabled to make a post-mortem examination of his body. From Mr. Tyer- man's account of his life, I learn that he was born on the 5th of March, 1756; and that his father died at the age of 75, and his mother at 104, and his grandmother at 110. Extra-anatomical discussion as to his age may be found in 'Notes and Queries,' April 12th, 1863, May 17th, 1862, June 17th, 1862 ; and a letter seriously impugning his claims to this length- ened term of years may be found in ' Jackson's Oxford Journal,' for September 27th, 1862. After making many enquiries myself, and after examining the evidence collected for me by my friend, A. B. Shepherd, Esq., of Brasenose College, upon the spots con- nected by tradition with the old man's early days, I have not been able to convince myself that one would be justified in rejecting as unfounded the statements as to his age which he himself uniformly and consistently made. I am not clear that it is possible to bring conclusive evidence as to a single case, such as this, from the revelations of anatomical in- vestigation. Sir Anthony Carlisle may not have been quite justi- fied in saying that most aged persons die of actual disease in organs not worn out by the length of time they have been performing their functions; but his dictum was not so far from the truth as * ' Notices of the life of John Pratt (now in hia io6th year),' by Thomas F.

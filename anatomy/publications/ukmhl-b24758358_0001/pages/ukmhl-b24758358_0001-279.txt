A comparison indeed of such a series as that which has been obtained from the small Danish island of Moen, figures and casts of some of the crania of which are readily accessible ^, with such a series of skulls as that which Canon Green well has presented to the Oxford Museum from the British round barrows, is instructive in many ways. By going over the entire number of specimens contained in such series we learn, firstly, that forms so widely different at first sight as the skull ' Cowlam, lix. 3,' and the one next to be described, or the one from Borreby figured in Sir Charles Lyell's ' Antiquity of Man' (p. 91,4th ed. 1S71), are nevertheless found in company and contem- poraneity with each other in many barrows. Secondly, vi^e find that '■ For figures of crania from the tumuli in Moen, see Nilsson's ' Stone Age' (trans. Lubbock), 1868, pi. xii. fig3. 230-232, pi. xiii. fig. 240, pp. 121, 126; Sir John Lubbock's ' Prehistoric Times' (3rd ed.), p. 159 ; Eetzius'' Ethnographische Schriften,' pi. iii. fig. 2. A cast. No. 5710, of a small skull from Moen is to be seen in the Royal College of Surgeons in London, and another of a larger one from Udby in the feame island was procured from the late Professor Thomson through the kind offices of Dr. F. Krebs for the Oxford University Museum. The original of this cast has been measured and described by Professor Virohow in the ' Archiv fiir Anthropologie,' torn. iv. pp. 68, 84, where he diaws especial attention to its ' capsuliires Hinterhaupt niitstarken Scbaltknochen der Lambdanaht,' points observable in 'Cowlam, lix. 3.'

XXI. EEPORT OF EXCAVATION OF A TWIN-BARROW AND A SINGLE ROUND BARROW AT SIG- WELL (SIX WELLS), PARISH OF COMPTON, SOMERSET. The following account of the examination of three round barrows at Sigwell, in the parish of Compton, Somersetshire, two of which were in juxtaposition and may be spoken of as a twin-barrow, whilst the other stood apart from any other barrow, but overlooked what we hold to have been a camp of an earlier period than these barrows, throws light upon the following questions. Firstly, it shows that in the Bronze age, and amongst men who were practising cremation, considerable variety existed as to the mode of their disposing of the dead. In the two burials discovered no urn had been employed, and the bones had been picked out of the pyre and placed apart, one set in a bark coffin, the other simply in a separate place in the soil of the barrow. Yet in one of the barrows pottery was found of a kind which showed with some probability that urn burial was not unknown to the original constructors of the barrow. Secondly, the measurements of the entire mass of each barrow, as compared with those of the very small spaces in which the bm-ned bones were contained, in one case within a circle of 6 inches radius, will show how exceedingly easy it must be to overlook the existence of such a burial, and how cautious we should be in asserting that nothing can be found in such mounds to serve as their raison d'etre. Thirdly, the relative position and elevation and other pecu- liarities of one of these barrows, that to be hereinafter spoken of as ' Sigwell iii,' and of a small British camp, show, as we believe very unmistakeably, that the camp was earlier in point of date than the barrow, and the work of stone-using, not of bronze-using, men.

PEEFACE. These volumes contain a selection of the most important Essays contributed by the late Professor RoUeston to the Transactions of various learned Societies and to scientific Journals. Along with them are also reprinted several Addresses delivered before the British Association for the Advancement of Science and other learned bodies. These reprints have been arranged in the following sections : I. Anatomy and Physiology, in which are included many im- portant Anthropological memoirs ; II. Zoology, including his Memoirs on Archseo-zoology; III. Archseology; IV. Addresses and Miscellaneous papers. Amongst the unpublished manuscripts left by Dr. Rolleston were notes on various subjects of archseological interest, which, owing to the failure in health that for some months preceded his much lamented death, he had evidently been unable to pre- pare for publication. Of these, his notes on the site of some Ptoman pottery works discovered in 1879 at the Mynchery upon the Sewage Farm near Littlemore, Oxford; also notes on archseological discoveries made both at Wytham, Berks, and at Yamton, Oxfordshire, are of much interest. Unfortunately these notes are too fragmentary to be reproduced in the form in which he left them, but I have prepared a digest, which has been printed as an appendix to the second volume. I have to thank the Councils of the Anthropological Institute, the Zoological Society, the Linnean Society, the Society of Antiquaries, the Royal Geographical Society, the Delegates of

OF THE OKANQ UTANG. 13 In Orang = i|inch. : 3 inch. = i : 2.40. In Man = i^inch. : 4^inch. = i : 2-75. In Chimpanzee' = 15-5" 32-5 = 0.48 : I. (In Orang = 4I inch. : 1^ inch. = i : 0-44. e : f. ) In Man = 6-7 inch,: 3-4inch. = i : 0-50, or r : 0.42, ( In Chimpanzee'= 99 mil. : 43 mil. = i : 0-43. The following six measurements of height, breadth, and length of the human cerebral hemispheres, are the three maximum and the three minimum measurements given by Huschke, at the ninety- ninth page of his work, already referred to:—• Maximum height in Chinese = 155 mil. „ breadth in Inca =i73*3i, „ length in Croat = 200 ,, Minimum in Hindoo Fakir = 124 mil. „ Croat = 103 „ „ Inca = 151 „ From these measurements it is evident that the variations of height oscillate within narrower limits in the human brain than the variations either of length or breadth. The measurement of height, therefore, would seem to possess greater serial importance than either of the other two measurements. Yet the following measurements will show that it is precisely in this dimension that the brain of the apes stands in the greatest relative inferiority to that of man.

Of all the differences of measurements and their relations as yet adduced, the difference between the relative heights of the human and the simious brains seems the most important. Small as the difference in the two measurements of corpora eal- losa may seem, we must yet record that posteriorly to the posterior bourrelet or rounded edge of that body in the orang, the corpora quadrigemina came into view when the brain was removed from the skull. This observation will be seen later to have, when coupled ' Schroeder Van der Kolk, citt. Huschke, 1. c, p. 82. " Idem, Ibid., p. 129. ' Ibid. * Gratiolet, ' Mdmoire/ p. 54.

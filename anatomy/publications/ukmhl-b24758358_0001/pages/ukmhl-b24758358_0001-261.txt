INTRODUCTION. in The following works and memoirs may be consulted as to points distinguishing male from female crania:â€” Humphry, 'Human Skeleton,' 1858, pp. 103-232. Von Baer, 'Crania Selecta,' Mem. Acad. Imp. St. Petersbourg, tom. viii. 1859, p. 259. Welcker,' Wachsthum und Bau des Menschlichen Sehadels,' 1862, pp. 65, 141. 'Archiv filr Anthropologie,' Bd. i. 1866, pp. no and 120-127. B. Davis, Ibid., Bd. ii. p. 25. Ecker, Ibid. p. 82,and Bd. ii. p. 110,1867, and 'Crania Germaniae Meridionalis Occidentalis/ 1865, p. 78. Aeby,' Schadelformen,' 1867, pp. 10-12. 'Archiv fiir Anthropo- logic,' vi. 1872, p. 302. Cleland, 'Phil. Trans.' 1870, pp. 124-132, 161-164. Weisbach, 'Archiv fiir Anthropologic,' Bd. i. 1866, pp. 191 and 285. 'Archiv fiir Anthropologic,' Bd. iii. 1868, p. 61. With tables such as those given by Dr. Aitken, 'On the Growth of the Recruit,' 1863, pp. 36-38, and by Welcker, 'Archiv fiir An- thropologic,' i. p. 119, 1864, there is very little difficulty in deter- mining with a high degree of probability the age of skulls below 30 years of age, if the bones of the trunk and limbs are available as well as the cranium. This, however, has by no means always been the case with the skulls of this series; still the condition of the teeth furnishes us with a fair indication for an approximate estimate of the age of their owner up to the age mentioned. When the teeth all alike have begun to show marks of wear, but the inner and outer surfaces of the skull still retain some smoothness and glossiness, I have spoken of the skull as belonging to a person in the ' early portion of middle life,' meaning thereby a period from 30 to 40. Greater wear of the teeth as yet unaccompanied with serious senile changes I have spoken of as characterising ' later middle life,' a period between 40 and 50. The commencement of senile changes I ])ave noted by speaking of the skull as having belonged to a person ' past middle life,' their greater development by speaking of the skull as that of an 'aged' person. In priscan, as indeed, according to Dr. E. Zuckerkandl ('Reise der Osterreich. Freg. Novara,' 1875, p. 117}, in modern skulls, both of civilised and savage races, the obliteration of the sutures of the skull takes place at any time within a period extending over no less a time than the twenty years from the age of 20 to that of 40.

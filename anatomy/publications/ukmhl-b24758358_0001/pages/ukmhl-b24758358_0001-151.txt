VI. ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ENAMEL IN THE TEETH OF MAMMALS, AS ILLUSTKATED BY THE VAKIOUS STAGES OF GROWTH DEMON- STRABLE IN THE EVOLUTION OF THE FOURTH MOLAR OP A YOUNG ELEPHANT, ELEPEAS INDICUS, AND OF THE INCISOR TEETH IN THE FOETAL CALF, BOS TAUBUS. A NAKED-EYE examination of a spirit preparation of a developing molar tooth of an elephant appears to be sufficient to show that in development the dentine takes precedence of the enamel in the tooth. In such a tooth a certain number of the more anteriorly placed denticles may be seen to be formed of caps of dentine, of a yellowish colour, encrusted, for various distances from their apices downwards, with opaque white deposits of enamel. Posteriorly to the denticles of this composite character, we see a few denticles consisting of dentine alone, upon which no deposition of enamel has as yet taken place; and, most posteriorly of all, we see processes of the dentinal pulp, which, as yet, are devoid of any covering of dentine. If, in the second place, we proceed to take note of the capsular processes in which the denticles are enclosed, we shall observe that the inner (reflected) surfaces of certain of these capsules are rough- ened over by deposit, in correspondence with the enamel deposit already noticed on the denticles which they surround. The deposit on the inner surface of the capsule is soft, and consists of cylindri- form cells packed closely together, and forming, when their interior surface is looked down upon, a mosaic arrangement by their apposi- tion, whilst in the immediate neighbourhood of their exterior (their still attached) surface, numerous blood-vessels are seen ramifying. There can be no doubt that we have here the often-described proxi- mal, and, as yet, but imperfectly calcified ends of the enamel-cells, p

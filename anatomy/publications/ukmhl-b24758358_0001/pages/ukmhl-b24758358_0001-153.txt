IN THE TEETH OF MAMMALS. 67 numerous memoirs or treatises on the development of the teeth which have appeared of late. It is believed, however, that as yet it has not been recorded that the enamel of the elephant's molar, as also that of the mastodon's, presents the very same decussating* arrangement of the inner portion of its enamel v?hich Mr. Tomes has figured ('Phil. Trans./ 1850^ pi. xliv, xlv, xlvi), as noted by him in the Rodentia, less the Leporidae and Hystricidae. Thus the rodent affinities of the elephant, which have so often been com- mented upon, receive a fresh illustration. P 2

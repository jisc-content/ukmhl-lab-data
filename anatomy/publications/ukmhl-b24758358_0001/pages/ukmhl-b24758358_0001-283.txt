The wisdom teeth are very much less worn than the two first molars; only one wisdom tooth however has been developed in the lower law. The lower jaw has lost by water-wear a good deal of its angle on the side figured ; the angle on the side not shown in the figure, though it would even by itself have been assigned to the male sex, has by no means the boldly defined outlines and large size usually seen in the brachycephali of this series. The inter-angular diameter however of the entire jaw is as large as that of even larger skulls of this type. The parieto-occipital dip is eminently brachycephalic ; the point of maximum height is anterior to the coronal suture, the point of maximum width is the region representing the faintly marked parietal tnbera. o

UPON THE SERIES OF PREHISTORIC CRANIA. 285 gladiatorial shows from the sacrificing of men at funerals, we know that the Italian races were at one time guilty of the same cruelty. ' iSTecdum ea aetate,' says Pleyne, Virg. 1. c, ' metuendum fuit Maroni ne displiceret immane facinus lectoribus,' such sacrifices having been abolished, as Pliny (H. N. xxx. 3. 4) tells us, by the Romans, only in the yeai* 97 B.C. Still, in spite of these familiar and a cloud of other testimonies ^ of the literary kind in favour ^ Aa regards the literature of immolation at funerals, the following references may be given in addition to those given in the text:— Herod, iv. 71, the words in which, iiruTa fiiifil KaTaffTtyd^ovfff iv 5e tt} Xoiirrj evpv- X'u/x]? TTjs Btjktjs, raiv traXKaKtoiv re jxiav avoiTvi^avTts Bairrovo'i, k.tX., find a detailed illustration in Dr. Joseph Anderson's translation of Professor Holmboe's Danish version of the Arabic account by Ahmed Fozlan of the cremation of a Norse chief, ' Proc. Soc. Ant. Scot.,' May 13, 1872, especially p. 525. Dr. Joseph Anderson, I.e. p. 522, refers to the Volsunga Saga as giving an account of the erection of a tent by Brynhild Gunnar over the pile on which she was to be burnt with Sigurd's corpse. J. C. F. Baehr, vol. iv. p. 560 of his 1832 edition of Herodotus, supplies the following refer- ences from Clarke's 'Travels' in illustration of the account given by Herodotus of the funeral of a Scythian chief: i. pp. 32. 38, 199, 316, 338 coll., 354, 399-432 seqq. I have not been able to verify these references, and they are omitted in Baehr's later edition, 1. c. I owe to him however many of the following references bearing prin- cipally upon the practice of widow-immolation:— Hdt. y. 5. Cicero, Tusc. Disp. v. 27. Diodorus Siculus, xvii. 91, and xis. 33, 34, Strabo, xv. i. 30. 699; xv, i. 62. 714. - Propertius, iv. 12-15. Nicolaus Damascenus, fragm. 143, 155-161; 3. 463. Valerius Maximus, ii. 6. Plutarch, ii. 499. Mela, ii, 2 ; iii. 2. Pausaniaa, iv. 2. 5. Aelian, V. H., vii. 18. Servius, fl. a.u. 390, ad Verg. Aen. vi. 228. Theodoret, Or. ad Graecos, ix. p. 129. Stephanas Byzantinus, s.v. Viria. With reference to this last-cited author it may be remarked that he makes no mention of any competition existing between the widows for the right of immolation on the occatdon of the husband's death. To the fact, however, of such a competition existing we have the evidence, whatever it may be worth, of Herodotus v. 5, Cicero, Propertius, Diodorus, Strabo, Valerius Maximus, Nicolaus Damascenus, and Mela, locc. citt. Grinmi, 'Das Verbrennen der Leichen,''Kleinere Schriften,' p. 300, agrees with Strabo, xv. i. 30, in considering as inadequate the reason reported or assigned by both Strabo and Diodorus, xvii. 91, for the origin of widow-burning, an institution for the establiabment of which, as we know from Professor Max Mtiller, 'Chips from a German Workshop,' ii. 34, ibique citatis, it was necessary to falsify the Vedae. He does not say why he repudiates the reason mentioned by those two writers, on tpwaai

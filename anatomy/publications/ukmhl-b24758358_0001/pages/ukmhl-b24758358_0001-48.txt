A walk round a Museum with Professor Rolleston was a treat I more than once enjoyed. He would take up topic after topic, some great and some small, and pour out his stores of precise and often recondite knowledge, always de- lighted to be questioned, and glad of any appearance of receiving information. I remember how once a turn was given to our talk by the chance mention of a piece of rascally cruelty in- flicted upon animals. I remember the rush of indignant words, and the excitement which could not abate till he had uttered his passionate exclamation.

Rolleston was a man whose mind and character were built on a large enough scale to allow of the full all-sided truth being told about him.

While awake his mind seemed never to be in a state of com- parative repose. It was constantly striving at the solution of some problem or other, either in argument or discussion, or in a

('Vergleichende Anatomie,' vol. iii. p. 194) to that of Mr. Parker XI. ON THE HOMOLOGIES OF CEETAIN MUSCLES CONNECTED WITH THE SHOULDER-JOINT. The main points of the paper which I have herewith the honour of laying- before the Linnean Society are, first, that the pectoralis secundus s. levator humeri of birds finds its homologue in the sub- clavius of mammals, and not in the pectoralis minor of antbro- potomy, and, secondly, that the ' epicoraco-humeraP muscle, as described by Mr. Mivart in the Echidna hystride and in the Iguana tuherculata, is the homologue of the two former of the three muscles now mentioned. A minor issue will be raised as to the source whence the sternal factor of the avian levator humeri comes to be added to the reptilian epicoraco-humeral, which, as its name implies, has no such mesial point of origin: and it may be stated at once that, though the mammalian subclavius furnishes instances of two methods whereby the subclavius of man may acquire such an accessory point of origin, viz. either by borrowing from the rectus abdominis, or by simple apposition to its head, from the cartilage of the first rib, of fibres from the praesternum on which it abuts; the analogy of other animals seems to point to its being in this latter way that this addition is made. Some other points of less moment will arise in the discussion of these questions, or be brought forward at the conclusion of the argument as to the pec- toral muscles. Dissections of the bony structures of the shoulder- girdle of the crocodile, and the coraco-scapular bone of the emu, and of certain of the muscles arising from these bones and passing to the upper extremity in either case, have been chosen for special examination, amongst other reasons, because the structural arrange- ments of the classes to which they respectively belong express, as has been remarked by anatomists from the time of Meckel

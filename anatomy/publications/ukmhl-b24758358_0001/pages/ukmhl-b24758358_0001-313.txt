XVI. GENERAL REMARKS UPON THE PRECEDING SERIES OF PREHISTORIC CRANIA FROM 'BRITISH BARROWS.' A LAJiGE series of skulls from prehistoric burial-places in the north of England, and chiefly in the East Riding' of Yorkshire, having, together with many others from other localities, been pre- sented to the Oxford University Museum by the Rev. William Greenwell, F.S.A., I undertook to select a certain number of these skulls for figuring and description. There is room for the addition of some general remarks to the account contained in the preceding chapter of the craniography of the skulls thus selected, a con- siderable quantity of additional material having come into our hands during the time which has elapsed since the commencement of this work. A craniographer with Canon Greenwell's series before his eyes in a coup-d^ceil view would be impressed with the fact that out of the series, t^vo sets, the one by its length typically illustrative of the dolichocephalic, the other by its breadth as typically illustrative of the brachycephalic form of skull, could at once be selected, even by a person devoid of any special anatomical knowledge. An antiquary similarly inspecting this series with a knowledge of its archaeological history would, if he separated it into two groups, the one containing all the skulls of the stone and bone age, the other containing all those of the bronze period, perceive that, while the latter group comprised both dolichocephalic and brachycephalic crania and in very nearly equal proportions, none but dolicho- cephalic skulls were to be found in any set of skulls from the barrows of the premetallic period ^. ' Sir William Wilde, in a lecture on the Ethnology of the Ancient Irit^h, delivered at the College of Physicians in 1844 and originally published in the 'Dublin Literary Journal,' promulgated the idea that two races, one dolichocephalic, the other

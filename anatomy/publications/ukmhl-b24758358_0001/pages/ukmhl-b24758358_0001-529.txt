'j6° Stature, as calculated from lengths of femur, 4' 9". The entire skeleton, as laid out with spacing between vertebrae, occupied a length of 4' io"-5, to which an inch should be added for scalp and plantar soft parts, making in all a stature of 4' 11"'5. ^ This measurement only admits of being approximately obtained in the female skeleton with which we have been comparing it, it is however about an inch less, a significant fact not without parallel in prehistoric skeletons. ^ For this Index, see 'British Barrows,' 1877, pp. 563, 667, and this volume, Article XV. p. 167.

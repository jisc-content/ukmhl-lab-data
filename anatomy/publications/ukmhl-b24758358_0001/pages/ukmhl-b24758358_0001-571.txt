THE BLOOD-COEPUSOLES OF THE ANNELIDE8. 481 is tte following- quotation from p. cxxix. of my ' Forms of Animal Life,' published in 1870:— ' In a few Annelids, again (Syllidea armata, the Opheliae, the CirratuUda, and the Staurocephali and Branchiobdella), the so-called pseud-haemal system contains corpus- culated blood, and communicates with the perivisceral cavity so as to form a lacunar circulation.' In answer to Professor Lankester's attack I have to say, that a careful consideration of the passage just quoted, and even as just quoted—that is to say, isolated and apart both from the connection in which it stands, and from discussions of the same subject else- where in the same book—is sufficient to suggest to any unprejudiced observer that the error which it contains is simply an error of the press. The passage should run, as by a most trifling and obvious transposition and alteration it can be made to run, thus:— 'In a few AnneUdes, again {Syllidea armata, the Opheliae, the CirratuUda, and the Staurocephali ), the so-called pseud-haemal system contains corpusculated blood, and in Branchiobdella communicateB with the perivisceral cavity, so as to form a lacunar circulation.' As regards the passage when thus altered, I shall hereafter attempt to show that it states what is currently accepted as our knowledge of the subject. But I have first to prove that, as it stands in the bookj it should have suggested to Professor Lankester that it should be thus manipulated and altered. Taking then the passage as it stands, and as isolated, I will ask the candid reader to note the eleven words contained in brackets, and par- ticularly the last five of them. He will observe that a comma is placed after each of the three sets of words, ^Syllidea armata^ 'the Opheliae^ 'the Cirrahdida;^ that to these three sets of words, a fourth similar set is added in the words, 'and the Staurocephali,' to which no comma is appended; and finally, that to this fourth set of words, denoting a fourth set of Annelides, a fifth set is added in the awkward set of words, ' and BrancM- ohdella' Surely the clumsy repetition of the particle ' and' might have been considered to indicate that somethino" was wronc: in the sentence, and when combined with the fact that no comma is placed after Slaurocephali,' must show that this latter word had somehow or other got dissevered from the terminal comma-super- seding bracket, by an accidental intercalation into the space left vacant above of the words ' and Branchiobdella^ These two words should be slightly altered into ' m Branchiobdella:'' and secondly I i

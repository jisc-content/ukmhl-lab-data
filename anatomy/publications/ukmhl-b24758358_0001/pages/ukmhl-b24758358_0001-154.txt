VII. NOTES ON THE BLOOD-COEPUSCLES OF THE TWO-TOED SLOTH, CHOLOPUS DIDACTYLU8, AND OF THE ELEPHANT, ELEPHASINDICUS. Mr. H. N. Moseley ^, of Exeter College, called my attention a few days ago to the appearance of nucleation which a slide of the dried blood-corpuscles of the Two-toed Sloth, Cholopus didactylus, presented under a quarter-of-an-ineh object-glass of Powell and Lealand's. I had a short time before met with a statement in the recently-published second part of Dr. Kiihne's 'Lehrbuch der Physiologischen Chemie,' p. 195^ to the effect that only some mammals, the sloth and the camel, possessed nucleated blood-cor- puscles. And this coincidence determined me to iise such means as we had at our disposal for settling a point as to which all recent authorities were, as far as my knowledge went, opposed to Dr. Kiihne. The employment of a twelfth-of-an-inch object-glass, by the same makers, has convinced Mr. Moseley and myself that, though a certain number of the dried blood-corpuscles of the sloth do contain one or more nuclei more or less roughly hewn, and irregularly and eccentrically placed, still the immense majority of them possess the non-nucleated character ordinarily assigned to the mammalian red blood-cell. The larger size of the blood-cells of the two-toed sloth, the largest next to those of the elephant put on record amongst mammalian blood-cells by Mr. Gulliver^, may in more ways than one have rendered an examination of them by a low power amenable to fallacy, and recourse to those of a higher power necessary. In * Now Professor Moseley, Dr. RoUeston's successor in the Linacre Chair. ^ ' Lehrbuch der Physiologischen Chemie,' von Dr. W.

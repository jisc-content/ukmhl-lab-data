66 ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ENAMEL which have broken away in the preparation from the more thoroug-hly calcified segments constituting- the enamel deposit on the denticles. It is, in fact, the layer which has been supposed to be at once the functionless ' membrana praeformativa' of Raschkow, and the func- tionally protective, however otherwise physiologically inert,' cuiicula dentls^ or ' Nasmyth's membrane.' If now, in the third place, we take a thin microscopic section of the anterior part of the lower jaw of a foetal calf, made in a sagittal direction, so as to show several developing teeth of various ages in situ, we are enabled easily to recognise the representatives of the various structures visible to the naked eye in the molar tooth of the elephant, and to harmonise the â€¢ apparently conflicting statements, which have been made, as to the relations held by the tissue forming the enamel prisms^ on the one hand, to the stellate tissue of the non-vascular enamel organ, and, on the other, to the vascular tooth- capsule. In such a section of a tooth, in which the enamel has already begun to be deposited, we can see the factor of the enamel organ, which is made up of stellate, loosely-compacted anastomosing cells, the so-called ' spongy substance/ occupying or forming a trian- gular area with the apex upwards. The apex of this triangular space marks the lowest level to which the formation of enamel has advanced in its progi-ess downwards from the summit of the tooth. Above this jDoint, or, in other words, where the formation of the enamel has called for an abundant supply of mineral matter, the non-vascular stellate tissue has disappeared, and allowed the vessels of the tooth- capsule to come into close relation with the enamel-forming cells which draw so largely upon what they contain. Below this point the stellate tissue gradually re-assumes its original propor- tions, and in a section of the lateral portions of the spoon-shaped incisors of the calf it may be seen to pass completely round the calcifying dental pulp from its buccal to its lingual surface. The area occupied by this stellate tissue corresponds, of course, to the parts of the cavities of the capsular processes, which lie below the level of the enamel deposit on the denticles; the disappearance of the stellate tissue in the molar of the elephant, and the separation in tliat preparation of the upper part of the capsule from the depositing enamel, are alike what the Germans call artefacla. Much of what has been advanced in this short paper may be found explicitly or implicitly stated in some one or other of the

THE NOTOOHOKD. 33 Fig. 34.â€”A SERIES OP TRANSVERSE SECTIONS TIIUOOGH THE NEtJRENTERIO AND NOTOCHORDAL CANAL OF A HOLE EMBRYO. (Heape.) The embryo was slightly more advanced than the one represented in Fig. 25. The dorsal opening is shown in I., continued into the primitive groove ; the canal passes thence through the column of cells which unites the epiblast and hypoblast at the front of the primitive streak (II.), into the noto- chordal thickening of the hypoblast (III.), along which it extends for some distance (IV.), and eventually opens ventrally (V.) into a median groove, which is formed in the notochordal thickening (n.ch.c.) ep, me, hi/, epiblast, mesoblast, hypoblast ; p.f/r. (in I. and II.), primitive groove ; c, nourenteric or notochordal canal; m.rjr. (in III., IV., and V.), medullary groove. VOL. I. D

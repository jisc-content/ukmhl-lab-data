IV, groove continuous with optic stalk ; As, pars subthalamica ; T.c, tuber cinereum. B. Section a little further back. Sf is replaced by a less prominent but broader fold of the roof. Ad, which subsequently receives the choroidal vessels, and is therefore the choroidal fold ; Ifs, hemisphere vesicle ; Th, thalamus ; S.M, sulcus of Monro, below and behind the thalamus. C. Still further back ; Ad, choroidal fold here projecting into lateral ventricles, but still free from mesoblast and bloodvessels ; Ma, mammillary tubercle. The other lettering as before.

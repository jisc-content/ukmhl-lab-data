DEVELOPMENT OF THE HEART. 139 is found to open from the right horn of the sinus into the right part of the common auricle. The sinus now forms a transversely disposed sac, lying below and behind the common auricle, with a larger right and a smaller left horn (the latter being Fig. 167.—Heart op human embryo slightly more advanced than that shown in fig. 166.

B, endothelial tube. a.c, auricular canal ; a.i, area interposita of His ; m, posterior mesocardium ; r.au, I.au, right and left auricles ; l.v, left ventricle ; r.v, right ventricle ; b.a, bulbus aortal. tapered off into the left duct of Cuvier); in this condition it has been termed by His seuxus rcuniens (fig. 169, B, and fig. 171). The umbilical and vitelline veins soon open into it by a common trunk, which becomes the upper end of the vena cava inferior. A oco' Fig. 168.—Heart of rabbit embryo.

The slit-like orifice of the sinus in the back of the right auricle is guarded by two valve-like folds of the endocardium, which project into the cavity of the auricle (right

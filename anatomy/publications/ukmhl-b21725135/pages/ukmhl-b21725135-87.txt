From these cells fibres, which are probably afferent (His), grow centrally into the hind-brain and peripherally along Fig. 90, C.â€”Section prom the same embryo at the exit of the facial nerve.

Some of these afferent fibres may form the chorda tympani, but there are many more than are found in that nerve. The optic nerves take origin as hollow outgrowths of the brain, which afterwards become solid, while nerve-fibres become developed in their walls. Their mode of origin will be further treated of in connection with the development of the eye. The olfactory lobe, which consists of the olfactory bulb and tract (often spoken of as the first or olfactory nerve), and the part of the base of the brain from which the tract arises, makes its appearance as a protrusion of the antero- ventral part of each cerebral hemisphere, extending towards the thickened olfactory area of the epiblast (see fig. 70, B, Rl; and fig. 74, olf). This primitive olfactory lobe is early seen to be divided into anterior and posterior parts by a broad sulcus (fig. 95). Of the two parts, the anterior becomes considerably elongated, and ultimately forms not only the tract and bulb but also the trigonum olfactorium, and a small area on the mesial side of this (termed by His Broca's area) ; whilst from the posterior, the larger part of the anterior perforated space (mesial to the lateral olfactory root) and the peduncle of the corpus callosum (gyrus

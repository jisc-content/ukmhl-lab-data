168 FORMATION OF THE AUDITORY OSSICLES. ,{ * .° ,V10US interpretation of these appearances would seem to bo that both the malleus and incus are developed from the cartilaginous bar of the first or mandibular arch 11s view is not, however, universally held. For, as the several illustrations show the second or nyoid bar is also connected to the developing incus, through which it is joined to the pSioSc capsule, lienee it has been inferred by some that the incus belongs to the hyoid bar ind not to the mandibular (A. Fraser). Others have looked upon it as representing a hyomandibular caitilage like that which m Sauropsida forms a common suspensory apparatus for both mandi Inilar and hyoidean apparatus (Huxley). This hyomandibula itself, however, may repre- Fig. 200.—Condition ok Meckel's car- tilage AND THE HYOID BAR IN THE HUMAN ECETUS OF ABOUT 18 WEEKS. (Kolliker.)

Lastly, yet another solu- tion of the question has been offered, viz., that both incus and malleus are hyomandibular (Albrecht, Gadow). The last mentioned opinion is based mainly upon considerations of com- parative anatomy, which can hardly be left out of account in dealing with the morphology of these structures. In lower Vertebrata the suspensory apparatus of the lower jaw comprises besides the hyomandibula, common to it and to the hyoid apparatus, a large bone, known as the quadrate, by means of which, either directly or with the intercalation of an os arti- culare, the lower jaw is united with the basis cranii and periotic capsule. Reichert looked upon the incus as the homologue of the quadrate, and the malleus as that of the os articulare ; and the same view was taken by Gegenbaur, Huxley, on the other hand, came to the conclusion that the homologue of the quadrate bone of reptiles and birds is to be found in the malleus, and that the incus represents a portion of the hyomandibular bar, which, as above stated, is common to both first and second arches. Various other observers have concluded that the quadrate of lower vertebrates is represented in mammals by the zygomatic process of the squamosal. Gadow, however, looks upon it as represented by the tympanic ring of mammals. The stapes has been variously described as representing: 1, a part of the hyoid arch (Reichert); 2, a part of the periotic capsule which has become detached (Parker); 3, in part or wholly, the hyomandibula of lower vertebrates (Gegenbaur, Huxley, Albrecht, Gadow); 4, hyomandibula and detached periotic cartilage conjoined (Gradenigo); 5, as an independent circular deposit of cartilage around the stapedial artery 1 (Salensky, Fraser). It is at any rate closely connected with the hyoid bar, which forms from above down the tympano-hyal and 1 This artery disappears in man, but is persistent in many mammals.

35 FORMATION OF PRO-AMNION. extended to this part. The head end of the embryo grows forward over this bilaminar portion, and since the embryo, as it becomes differentiated, tends to sink below the general surface of the blastoderm, the head which now overlies the bilaminar part produces a depression of this part towards the interior of the vesicle, so that the head of the embryo becomes enclosed by the bilaminar wall of the depression (fig. 36). The enclosing membrane, which is well marked in the rabbit, has been termed by v. Beneden the pro-amnion,: by an extension of mesoblast and of the mesoblastic cleavage between its layers, it afterwards becomes split into somatopleure and splanchnopleure, and the former becomes continuous with the true amnion (see p. 42). The stage of pro-amnion, if it exists at all, must disappear very early in the human embryo. Soon after the appearance of the anterior limiting sulcus, two lateral limiting sulci arc seen running external and parallel to the medullary folds ; these lateral sulci, as they dip down, mark off the body of the embryo from the rest of the Fig. 36.— DIAGRAMMATIC LONGITUDINAL SECTIONS THROUGH THE EMBRYO OF THE RABBIT. The SECTIONS SHOW THE MANNER IN WHICH THE PRO-AMNION IS FORMED BY A DIPPING DOWN OF THE HEAD AND ANTERIOR PART OF THE BODY INTO A DEPRESSION OF THE BLASTODERM WHICH AT THIS PART IS FORMED OF EPIBLAST AND HYPOBLAST ONLY.

That part of the cavity Of the original blastodermic vesicle which does not form a part of the alimentary canal, but remains connected with it by a wide neck of communication, is known as the yolk-sac. At a later stage, when the body walls are formed, and the yolk-sac, relatively greatly diminished in size, lies altogether outside the body of the foetus, it is merely connected by a long narrow duct, which runs D 2

90 DEVELOPMENT OF THE EAR. exterior. In elasmobranch iishes this connection is never closed, but remains throughout life in the form of a small duct-like tube which passes up through the cranial wall and opens on the epidermis. In other vertebrates the connection with the exterior becomes closed—in the chick during the third day—and what remains A B Fig. 104.—Sections through region of the hind-brain of human embryos, showing three STAGES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE OTIC VESICLE.

Eventually it developes into a long epithelial tube, which passes through the petrous bone, with an expanded end lying within the skull underneath the dura mater. This tube and its expanded termination form respec- tively the endolymphatic canal and saccule (fig. 106). In the meantime the auditory vesicle becomes elongated and begins to be irregular. Its ventral end projects as a distinct hollow process, at first straight, but soon becoming curved ; this is the rudiment of the epithelial canal of the cochlea.

They become connected subsequently with outgrowths from the posterior nerve-rudiments. These rudimentary sense organs have been described in mammals also (by Froriep). They appear to represent the special sense organs of the gill clefts of fishes, which were first de- scribed by Leydig (1850). Beard is of opinion that the nose and ear are also specialised branchial sense organs, the only ones that are persistent in higher vertebrates. This differentiation of a special sensory portion of epiblast into rudiments of special sense- organs, occurs according to Golowine’s observations in the chick, not only in the head but also in the trunk, where they in all probability represent rudiments of “organs of the lateral line,” such as are seen in fishes. Various observers have described the ganglion rudiments as actually becoming formed at

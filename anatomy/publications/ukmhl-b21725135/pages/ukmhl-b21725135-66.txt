58 DEVELOPMENT OF THE SPINAL CORD. teimcd myelospongivw, and the cells by which it is formed arc spoken of as snonaio- blcists (Ilis) (fig. Gl). Between the inner ends of the columnar epithelium cells or spongioblasts there is seen at a comparatively early period (four and five weeks in the human embryo) a number of rounded cells, with a considerable amount of clear protoplasm, forming Fig. 61.

Fig. 61.— Three neuroblasts, each with a nerve-fibre process growing out beyond the BASEMENT MEMBRANE OF THE EMBRYONIC SPINAL CORD (His). an interrupted layer in this innermost zone. Their nuclei are mostly in one stage or another of karyokinesis (fig. 02). They are termed by His the germinal cells, and according to him they give origin to the cells next to he described. The third kind of cell (neuroblast) met with in the cord of the early embryo is one with a relatively large oval nucleus, and little protoplasm, hut with a tapering protoplasmic prolongation directed outwards towards the surface of the cord. These cells arc found in groups, at first only in or near the layer of germinal cells (fig. 63), hut subsequently in the outer layers (fig. Of). The prolongations are the com- mencements of the nerve-fibres, and they mostly converge either straight or with an arcuate course towards what will subsequently he the place of exit of the fibres of the anterior roots. The outermost layer of the embryonic cord after the differentiation of the various kinds of cells above described is free from nuclei, and is composed of the partly reticulated, partly radially arranged external or attached extremities of the

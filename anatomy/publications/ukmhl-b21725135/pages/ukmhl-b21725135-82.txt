DEVELOPMENT OF THE NERVES. 74 to the dorsal aspect of the neural tube, but that attachment becomes subsequently lost, and they then form completely isolated portions of cpiblast, composed of oval cells, and lying at the side of the embryonic cord between it and the muscle plates ol the pioto\eitebim (fig. 84). ihese are the rudiments of the posterior-root ganglia. The remainder of the neural crest disappears : at least in most vertebrata. Some little time after the separation of these ganglion-rudiments, the ventral or anterior roots of the spinal nerves begin to grow out from the ventro-lateral aspect of the neural tube. They were originally described by Balfour in elasmobranchs, as forming bud-like outgrowths from the neural epiblast, the outgrowths being com- posed ol spindle-shaped cells (fig. 84, nr). But according to the recent and extended Fig. 84.—Section through the dorsal part op the trunk op a torpedo embryo.

These cells are in fact neuroblasts, and from either end of each cell, which is thus rendered bipolar (fig. 8(1), a process becoming eventually the axis-cylinder of a nerve-fibre grows out, one towards the central organ, the other towards the periphery. The centrally directed processes soon reach and grow into the embryonic cord at its dorso-lateral aspect, where they are presently seen in sections occupying an oval area near the periphery of the cord ; 1 The place at which the anterior roots spring from the cord is not opposite to the corresponding posterior root, but midway between that root and the succeeding one.

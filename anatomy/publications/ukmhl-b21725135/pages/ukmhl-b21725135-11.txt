3 PLAN of organization. Fig. 1.—Diagram op an early human embryo. (Allen Thomson.) s, s, indications of the vertebral divisions along the line of the back ; r, u, upper limb ; t, f, lower limb ; a, umbilical cord. In the cranial part the divisions of the brain are indicated, together with the eye, and au, the auditory vesicle ; near b, the visceral arches and clefts of the head, forming inter alia the rudiments of the upper and lower jaws. Fig. 2.—Semi-diagrammatic view op a longitudinal section op the embryo represented in FIGURE 1 ; SHOWING THE RELATIONS OP THE PRINCIPAL SYSTEMS AND ORGANS.' (Allen Thomson.) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, primary divisions of the brain in the cranial part of the neural canal; n, n, spinal cord in the vertebral part of the canal ; s, spinous process of one of the vertebral; ch, chorda dorsalis run- ning through the axis of the vertebral centra ; ok', the same extending into the base of the cranium : a, dorsal aorta ; p, pharyngeal cavity ; i, i, alimentary canal : /t, ventricular part of the heart, with which the arterial bulb is seen joining the aorta by arches ; b, visceral arches of head ; l, liver ; w, Wolffian body ; v, urinary vesicle or allantois, joining the intestine in the cloaca, cl ; u, u1, umbilicus.

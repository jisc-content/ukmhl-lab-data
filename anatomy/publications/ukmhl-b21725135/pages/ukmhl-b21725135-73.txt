65 DEVELOPMENT OF THE MEDULLA OBLONGATA. reduced to a thin layer of flattened epithelium, the substance of this part of the medulla oblongata is wholly formed by a thickening of the shifted lateral boundaries. In these, the bend marking the distinction between the ventral and dorsal laminae— now bv change of position mesial and external—continues to be evident, and is in fact recognizable even in sections of the fully-developed brain. l Of the longitudinal columns of the medulla oblongata the restiform bodies first become prominent (third month in the human embryo). The (anterior) pyramids are obvious in the fifth month, and the olivary tubercle about the sixth. But before any of these, and indeed with Pig. 71.—Sections across the region op the calamus scriptorius op the brain represented in fig. 70, A. (His.) A, region of the glossopharyngeal ganglion. B, of the auditory-facial ganglion. Fig. 72.—Sections across the fourth ventricle op a somewhat older embryo (His.) A, section taken through the lower part. B, across the widest part (trigeminus region). C, through upper part (cerebellar region). r, roof of neural canal : al, alar lamina ; hi, basal lamina ; v, ventral border. Pig. 73.—Sections across the lower half of the fourth ventricle op a still older embryo, showing gradual opening out op the neural canal and the commencing folding over op the alar lamina (at/). v, ventral border ; t, tamia; ot, otic vesicle ; rl, reeessus labyrinthi. In the succeeding stage (not here represented) the angle at v has almost disappeared, the fold / has extended over the alar lamina, and the two thickened halves are in the same horizontal plane, covered by a greatly expanded and thinned out roof.

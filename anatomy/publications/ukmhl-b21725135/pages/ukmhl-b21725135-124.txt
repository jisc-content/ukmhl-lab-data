11G DEVELOPMENT OF THE URINARY AND GENERATIVE ORGANS. wards, a series of transversely coursing tubes becomes developed in the intermediate* cell-mass. These tubes are connected for a time with other involutions of the peritoneal epithelium (fig. 141), but subsequently lose their connection with that A Fig. 138.—Diagrams of the arrangement of the urinary and genital organs in elasmobranchs.

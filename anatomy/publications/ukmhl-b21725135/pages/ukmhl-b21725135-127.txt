THE WOLFFIAN DUCT AND BODY. 119 are observed developing in the bowl of the spoon from mesoblast cells, which presently become entirely enclosed by the end of the tube. Subsequently a second Fig. 142.—Transverse sections of sheep embryos, showing two stages in the development of THE WOLFFIAN BODY. (BoilUet.) w.d, Wolffian duct; w.b, Wolffian body; p.v, protovertebra; ch, notochord; n.c, neural canal; am, amnion ; uo, aorta ; i, intestine; y.s, yolk-sac. with glomeruli become formed between, and open into those which are already connected with that duct. All these tubes are short and straight when first deve- loped, but afterwards lengthen and become converted into convoluted uriniferous tubes, which, like those of the permanent kidneys, begin in a dilated extremity enclosing a tuft of capillary blood-vessels (glomerulus), which are supplied by branches of the primitive aortas. Fig. 141.—Transverse section through the trunk of a duck embryo with about twenty-four MESOBLASTIC SOMITES. (Balfour.) am, amnion; so, somatopleure; sp, splancknopleure ; wd, Wolffian duct ; si; segjnental tube with peritoneal involution ; ca.v, cardinal vein ; m.s, muscle-platc ; sp.g, spinal ganglion ; sp.c, spinal cord ; ch, notochord ; ao, aorta ; hy, hypoblast. and a third set of tubes become developed in a similar manner, but without perito- neal invaginations, and also open directly into the Wolffian duct. Lastly, other tubes

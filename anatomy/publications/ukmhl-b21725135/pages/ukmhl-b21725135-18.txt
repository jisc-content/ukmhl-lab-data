10 FORMATION OF POLAR GLOBULES. Fig. 9.—Formation op the first polar globule in the egg of ascaris jiegalocephala. (v. Gehuchten.) A. The ovum with the germinal vesicle transformed into a spindle of (achromatic) fibrils : from the poles of the spindle other fibrils radiate into the protoplasm. At the equator of the spindle eight portions of chromatin are visible ; cs, head of a spermatozoon which lias previously entered the ovum, and is becoming transformed into the male pronucleus ; m, gelatinous membrane of the ovum. B. The chromatin particles are seen separated into two sets. The achromatic fibrils are not shown in this preparation. The ovum is considerably shrunken. C. Half of the germinal vesicle is extruded into a perivitelline space, and along with a portion of protoplasm is becoming separated off from the ovum as a polar globule. The extruded half inchuhs four of the chromatin particles ; the other four remain in the ovum ; m', membrane dividing the polar globule from the ovum. A P> C D Tig. 10.—Formation of the second polar globule in ascaris megalocephala. (Carnoy.) A. The remainder of the germinal vesicle (after extrusion of the first giobule, f/1) has again become transformed into a spindle of achromatic fibrils, with the four remaining chromatin particles at the equator of the spindle. B. The spindle, now irregularly Y-shaped, is seen approaching the surface of the ovum ; </, first polar globule; ns, male pronucleus which has become formed from a spermatozoon; p. pole of spindle. C. Extrusion of half of the germinal vesicle remainder. D. Completion of the process; the second polar globule, ff2, is now separated from the ovum ; it contains two of the chromatin particles. The other two remain in what is left of the germinal \ esicle, /t:i which now forms the female pronucleus ; ns, male pronucleus ; first polar globule.

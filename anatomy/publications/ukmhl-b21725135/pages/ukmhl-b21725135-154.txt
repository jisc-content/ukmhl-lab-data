140 DEVELOPMENT OF THE PRINCIPAL ARTERIES. into it from the compact outer layer of muscle, and unite with one another to form a spongework of muscular trabeculm, while the endothelium of the cavity becomes depressed between and over these trabeculie, and lines all the spaces between them, which thus communicate with the cavity of the ventricle. The ventricles are therefore now in the same condition in which they are found permanently in many of the lower vertebrates (e.g. frog). Ultimately the compact outer layer of muscle becomes greatly increased in thick- ness, and the spongework of trabeculae occupies a relatively much smaller portion of the cavity, being developed in part into the columnoe oarneoe of the adult heart. Peculiarities of the foetal heart.—Besides the peculiarities of structure, which have been above described, the foetal heart differs in position, in relative size, and in the thickness of its several parts, from tiie organ after birth. Thus it is at first placed immediately under the head, but subsequently, with the development of the neck, it gradually assumes a position farther back. In early foetal life it is much larger in proportion to the size of the body than at a later period, and at birth it is still proportionally large. The walls of both ventricles are of equal thickness during foetal life, a peculiarity which is evidently connected with the fact that in consequence of the communication of the pulmonary artery, through the ductus arteriosus, with the aorta, the blood pressure which they have to overcome is the same. DEVELOPMENT OP THE PRINCIPAL ARTERIES. From the point of insertion of the aortic bulb into the ventral wall of the foregut, first one, and then in succession four other arterial arches, become formed, and pass on either side, one into each visceral arch.

These two vessels run down the trunk on either side of the notochord, yielding, as they descend, lateral offsets to the body walls and to the yolk sac. finally they give off, at the lower or posterior extremity, two large vessels, which accompany the allantois, and furnish blood to the foetal part of the placenta (umbilical or allantoic arteries). The primitive aortic do not long remain double. As was first shown by means of sections by Allen Thomson, they unite in the middle line, the union beginning in the dorsal region and extending forwards and backwards ; in the latter direction

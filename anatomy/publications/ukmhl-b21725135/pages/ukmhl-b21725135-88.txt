Fig. 91.—Cranial nerves of a human embryo, 10.2 mm. long. (His.) -f- The cranial nerves are indicated by Koman,. the spinal nerves by Arabic numerals, c./i, cerebral hemisphere ; Ih, thalamencephalon ; m.b, mid-brain; Mx, maxillary process; Mu, mandibular arch ; Hy, hyoid arch ; the facial nerve is seen to send a branch (chorda tympani) across the hyomandibular cleft ; G.g, Gasserian ganglion ; c.g, ciliary ganglion ; v, vestibular, and c, cochlear part of auditory ; g.p, ganglion petrosum of glosso-pharyngeal ; g.j, ganglion jugulare of vagus ; an anastomosis is seen between these ; g.tr, ganglion trunci of vagus ; F, ganglion described by Froriep as belonging to the hypoglossal; r.d, ramus descendens of hypoglossal • ot otic vesicle. The eye is also represented, and a part of the heart. Fig. 92.—Diagram showino the centripetal and centrifugal roots of the cranial nerves of TI1E SAME EMBRYO. (His. ) The places of exit of the nerves are marked by dotted circles or ovals. The efferent nerves (HI-• IV, mV, VI, VII, part of IX, XI, and XII), arc seen to arise within the nerve centre from groups ot neuroblasts ; the afferent fibres (F>, VIII, v and c, most of IX, and X), pass a certain distance in- wards, and for the most part also caudalwards in the nerve-centre, and there end. The ganglion ru< i- inents from which they have grown are not shown here. They will be found in the preceding ngme.

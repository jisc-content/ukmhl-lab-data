20 FORMATION OF THE BLASTODERM. third or intermediate layer. This is mainly derived, as was first pointed out by Ivolliker, from the primitive ectoderm of the groove, but since in this situation the two primary layers become eventually more or less blended, it is probable that the primitive entoderm cells also take part in its formation, although this part is in the mammal evidently a subordinate one. It is further maintained by many embry- Fig. 21.—Section across the posterior end of the embryonic area of a rabbit at the time OF THE FIRST SIGN OF A PRIMITIVE STREAK.

development oe the eye. 8a development of the eye. T1 first development of the eye occurs as a hollow protrusion of the anterior -primary optic vesicle-in the manner already menhoned (see fio- 68 e ancl fi<>'. 03). The vesicle thus formed abuts externally against the external epiblast of the side of the head (fig. 96) ; and this external epiblast opposite the most prominent point of the primary optic vesicle, becomes thickened and Fig. 95.—Side view op the same part op THE BRAIN IN A STILL MORE ADVANCED EMBRYO, THE EYE HAVING BEEN CUT AWAY.

This island, which is the rudimentary lens, lies between, but is entirely distinct from the external epiblast on the one hand, and the neural epiblast of the primary optic vesicle on the other hand. Its forma- tion is accompanied by a cupping in of the primary optic vesicle (figs. 94, 97, 98), which is invaginated before it, and this invagination is increased by an ingrowth of mesoblast, which occurs between the lens and the cupped optic vesicle, and which subsequently forms the vitreous humour. Invaginated in this way the cavity of the original optic vesicle becomes almost entirely obliterated, and appears merely as a cleft between the two layers which form the wall of the so-called “ optic cup.” The inner of these two layers is from the first thicker than the outer, and in it are developed all the parts of the future retina from the membrana limitans interna

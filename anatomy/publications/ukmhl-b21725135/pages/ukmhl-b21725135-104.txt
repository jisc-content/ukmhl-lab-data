DEVELOPMENT OF THE NOSE. 06 Fig. 112.—Head op an embryo still more advanced in development. (His.) A, from above ; B, roof of mouth after removal of lower jaw ; i.m, placed on the fronto-nasal process and just above its intermediate depressed part; l.n.pr, lateral nasal process ; m.n.pr, mesial nasal process ; the other letters as before.

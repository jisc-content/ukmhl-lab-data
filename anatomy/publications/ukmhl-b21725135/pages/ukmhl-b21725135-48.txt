q'u HEART AND VASCULAR SYSTEM. almost continuous chain. These red points are small groups of coloured nucleated blood corpuscles which have been developed within certain of the mesoblast cells in the manner explained in another portion of this work (see Histology, Development of blood-corpuscles and blood-vessels). The mesoblast cells in question form the blood- vessels of the vascular area by becoming united with one another into a capillary net"oik, vhich becomes connected mcsially with branches of the primitive aortic Fig. 43.â€”Vascular area op tiie rabbit op 11 days. (v. Beneclen and Julin.) The arteries are represented red, the veins Line ; the capillaries are not shown. In both the stages illustrated, the terminal sinus is seen to be arterial. (vitelline arteries), and peripherally with a circular vessel (terminal sinus), arterial in mammals but venous in the chick, which forms the circumferential boundary of the vascular area. From the capillary network of the vascular area the blood is collected into two vitelline veins, which course backwards and inwards to carry the blood of the area to the venous roots of the heart. This is the first circulation, or the circulation of the vascular area. It is also called the vitelline circulation, because the vascular area is developed in the mesoblast of the splanchnopleural layer which encloses the vitcllus, and its capillaries are an important means of bringing the food material of the vitellus to the embryo. The origin of the cells which form the endothelium of the vascular system is not definitely known. It has been supposed by some that they are in the first instance of hypoblastic origin, but the evidence on this point is insufficient, and it is more generally held that they are specially modified mosoblastic cells. Regarding the origin of the endothelium of the heart, see p. 13G.

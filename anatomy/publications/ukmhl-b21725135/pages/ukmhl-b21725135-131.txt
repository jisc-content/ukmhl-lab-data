THE MCLLERIAN DUCT. 123 duct (fio-. 149), To this duct it presently adheres intimately, and then continues Fi". 147. — Four sections through the anterior part op the SEGMENTAL DUCT OF A SCYLLIUM EMBRYO. (Balfour. ) The figure shows how the segmental duct becomes split into the Wolffian duct dorsally and the Mullerian duct or oviduct ventrally; Wd, Wolffian duct; od, Mullerian duct or oviduct ; sd (in D), segmental duct. to grow backwards for a certain distance as a thicken- ing of the epithelium of that tube, the thickening becoming gradually separated off from before back- wards, and the lumen passing along it. Further back it ceases to grow thus in connection with the Wolffian duct, but is prolonged as an independent cellular cord, which lies in a groove along the side of the Wolffian duct (Balfour and Sedgwick). Entering the genital corcl} the two Mullerian ducts lie at first on the mesial side of the corresponding Wolffian ducts, but lower down pass behind them ; they finally come again between these ducts, lying close together, and, according to Mihalkovics, approach close to the siuus urogenitalis, which by this time is formed out of the ventral part of the cloaca (see p. 128) without actually opening into it for some time. The Mullerian ducts fuse together below into a single tube (second month); the fusion begins not at the lower end.

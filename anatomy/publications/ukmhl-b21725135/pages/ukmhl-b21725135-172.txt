THE LIMBS. 164 Each limb consists of a part which is sunk in the substance of the lateral rkbm, and in which the thoracic or pelvic girdle becomes developed, and of a free "or Fig. 194.â€”Transverse section through an anterior part of the trunk of an embryo of Scyllium. (Balfour.; sp. c, spinal corcl; sp.g, ganglion of posterior root; ar, anterior root; dn, dorsal ; sp. n, ventral branch of spinal nerve ; mp, muscle plate; mp', part of muscle plate already converted into muscle; mp.I, part of muscle plate extending into the limb ; nl, nervus lateralis ; ao, aorta ; ch, notochord ; sy.g, sympathetic ganglion; ca.v, cardinal vein ; sd, segmental duct; st, segmental tube; du, duode- num ; hp.d, junction of hepatic duct with it; pan, rudiment of pancreas connected with another part of duodenum ; umc, opening of umbilical canal (vitelline duct). projecting part (fig. 195). This is at first quite simple, and represents the distal segment of the limb (hand or foot). The other two segments (forearm and leg ; arm and thigh) are successively marked off between it and the girdle by the development of transverse furrows representing the joints (fifth and sixth week). At about the same time four notches appear in the flattened distal extremity, marking off the intervals between the fingers and toes, and the middle segment (fore-arm or leg) begins to be flexed upon the proximal (arm or thigh), the the limbs do not receive such prolongations from the muscle-plates in birds and mammals ; the muscles develop in situ from previously indifferent mesoblast.

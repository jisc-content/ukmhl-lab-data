DEVELOPMENT OF THE HEART. 143 cavity, where its situation is externally marked by a groove. The free edge of this septum grows forwards and downwards, and the septum (fig. 170, s) giadua ly separates the auricular cavity into a right and left half, the separation being com- pleted by the junction of its free edge, which shows a distinct endocardial thickening, V.C.S. Fig. 173.â€”Two STAGES IN the formation of the septum intermedium in the heart of the human EMBRYO. (His.) In A the septum is represented as growing from a triangular area to the left of the sino-auricular orifice ; in B it has coalesced with the endocardial cushions, and lies like a stopper in the auricular canal. r.a, l.a, right and left auricle ; r.v, l.v, right and left ventricle; s.r, sinus venosus; Eu. v, Eustachian valve ; s.sp, septum spurium ; s.s, septum superius; s.ivf, septum infcrius ; s.i, septum intermedium ; v.c.s, vena cava superior dextra.

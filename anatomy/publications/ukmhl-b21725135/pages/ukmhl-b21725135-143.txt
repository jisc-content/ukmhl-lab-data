DEVELOPMENT OF THE HEART. 135 The mesoblastic cleft (coelom, ph) is somewhat dilated, but is not doubled in, as iu the heart region. The lateral mesoblast ceases a short distance beyond it. Fig. 161 is a section through the middle of the head region of the same embryo. Here, while Fig. 158.—Embryo rabbit of eight days and eighteen hours, with 9 protovertebr.®, viewed FROM THE VENTRAL ASPECT. 2^. (Kolliker.)

A, view from below of an embryo in which the formation of the heart was somewhat more advanced than in fig. 158, and of which an outline of the heart is repeated in B. C, from another embryo, shows the two halves of the heart in the commencement of their coalescence, h, the part of the bent tube which becomes the ventricle ; a, primitive aortic arches and descending aortic ; VV, vitelline veins entering the heart posteriorly The arrows indicate the course of the blood. the other parts of the section arc much the same as in front, the dilatation of the coelom, which is in fact the rudiment of the future pericardium, is occupied by an Fig. 160.—Section from the same embryo further forward than that shown in the following figure.

This fold becomes subsequently entirely separated and the aperture or line of invagination closed; it forms the

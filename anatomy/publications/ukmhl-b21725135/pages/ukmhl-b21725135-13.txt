5 DESCRIPTIVE TERMS. plane. The words anterior and posterior, superior and inferior, and several others indicating position, are employed in human anatomy strictly with reference to the erect posture of the body. But now that the more extended study of comparative anatomy and embryonic development is largely applied to the elucidation of the human structure, it is very desirable that descriptive terms should be sought which may without ambiguity indicate position and relation in the organism at once in man and animals. Such terms as dorsal and ventral, neural and visceral, cephalic and caudal, central and peripheral, proximal and distal, axial and appendicular, pre- axial and postaxial, are of this kind, and ought, whenever this may be done con- sistently with sufficient clearness of description, to take the place of those which are only applicable to the peculiar attitude of the human body, so as to bring the language of human and comparative anatomy as much as possible into conformity. In many instances, also, precision may be obtained by reference to certain fixed relations of parts, such as the vertebral and sternal aspects, the radial and ulnar, and the iibial and fibular borders, the flexor and extensor surfaces of the limbs, and similarly in other parts of the body.

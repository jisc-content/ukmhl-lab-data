19 FORMATION OF THE BLASTODERM. sfrectj. (ficrs. 18,19). Almost as soon as the primitive streak has become fully formed, it mav be observed to be scored along its length, except at the anterior end which is that directed towards the centre of the embryonic area, by a narrow groove—the primitive groove. The proliferating primitive ectoderm comes into close relationship below this groove with the primitive entoderm, and the two may be partly or Pier, 17.—Embryonic area of mole immediately prior to appearance of primitive streak and FORMED OF TWO LAYERS ONLY, Fig. 18. —Embryonic area of the mole showing the primitive streak and groove ending POSTERIORLY IN A CRESCENTIC THICKENING. The area is bilaminar in front, trilaminar in the posterior half.

They are magnified 49 times. entirely blended, but the union is closest at the anterior end of the primitive streak where a continuous column of cells unites the primitive ectoderm and entoderm, so that the two layers are here indistinguishable. The proliferation of the cells of the primitive streak subsequently proceeds chiefly at the sides of the primitive groove, and the cells which are produced by this proli- feration extend themselves laterally between the ectoderm and entoderm to form a 1'ig. 20, A. and B.—Views of the embryonic area of the rabbit showing two stages in the EXTENSION OF THE MESOBLAST. (Kolliker.) In A. the mesoblast extends on either side of the primitive streak over the posterior part of the embryonic area and also behind the primitive streak beyond the limits of that area. In B. the mesoblast extends over a circular area which surrounds the embryonic area. The em- bryonic area is also trilaminar, except in the middle line in front of the primitive streak.

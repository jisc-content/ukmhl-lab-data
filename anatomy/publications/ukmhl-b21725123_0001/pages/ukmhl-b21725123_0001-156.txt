148 DEVELOPMENT OF THE PRINCIPAL ARTEUIES. time of birth being the fourth and fifth arches of the left side, which form the arch of the aorta and the ductus arteriosus respectively. This obliteration begins early in the iiist and second arches, so that in many animals by the time the posterior arches are formed the anterior are partially obliterated ; but in man this is not the case, all five pairs of arches being present and fully pervious for a certain time (figs 178, 179, from His). V b As development proceeds, the point of insertion of the aortic bulb, which is at first opposite the first arterial arch, becomes, along with the rest of the heart.

Finally, by a continuance of the same process, the fourth arch on each side comes to spring from the ascending trunk : that of the right side forming the innominate artery, that of the left the arch of the aorta ; and only the fifth arch, from which the pulmonary arteries spring, has for a time a descending direction. From the dorsal part of the first arch a branch passes towards the brain—this becomes the upper part of the internal carotid. When the first and second arches become obliterated—a change which next occurs—this branch remains in continuity with the third arch by the unobliterated dorsal portions of the first and second arches (upper extremity of primitive aortae) ; these portions, together with the third arch, form the lower part of the internal carotid, the posterior communication between the third and fourth arch becoming obliterated. The branches of the external carotid are produced from the remains (ventral) of the first and second arches ; the maxillary and temporal arteries from the first, the lingual and ascending pharyngeal arteries, and probably also the occipital and auricular, from the anterior part of the second arch. The division of the bulb into aortic and pulmonary trunks begins just at the time when the extremity of the aortic bulb has become shifted backward so as

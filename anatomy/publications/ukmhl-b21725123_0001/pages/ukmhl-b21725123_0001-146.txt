DEVELOPMENT OF THE HEART. 138 The s-inus venosns may be described as consisting of two lateral enlargements or horns, and of a transverse part connecting these horns. The veins which it at this time receives are the umbilical, the vitelline, and the ducts of Cuvier (formed A B Fig. 165.—Condition of the heart in the human embryo of about fifteen days, reconstructed FROM SERIAL SECTIONS.

The sinus is at first in free communi- cation with the common auricular cavity, but the junction presently becomes narrowed, and the resulting aperture, which eventually acquires a slit-like character,

Fig. 91.—Cranial nerves op a human embryo, 10.2 mm. long. (His.) f. The cranial nerves are indicated by Roman, the spinal nerves by Arabic numerals, c. h, cerebral hemisphere ; th, thalamenceplialon ; m.l), mid-brain; Mx, maxillary process; Mn, mandibular arch ; lit], hyoid arch ; the facial nerve is seen to send a branch (chorda tympani) across the hyomandibular cleft ; G.g, Gasserian ganglion ; c.g, ciliary ganglion ; v, vestibular, and c, cochlear part of auditory ; g.p, ganglion petrosum of glossopharyngeal; g.j, ganglion jugulare of vagus ; an anastomosis is seen between these ; g.tr, ganglion trunci of vagus ; /*', ganglion described by Froriep as belonging to the hypoglossal; r.d, ramus descendens of hypoglossal • ot otic vesicle. The eye is also represented, and a part of the heart. Fig. 92.—Diagram showing me centripetal and centrifugal roots of the cranial nerves of THE SAME EMBRYO. (His.) The places of exit of the nerves are marked by dotted circles or ovals. The efferent nerves (///., IF, mV FI, VII, part of IX, XI, and XII), are seen to arise within the nerve centre from groups ot neuroblasts ; the afferent fibres (F.s, VIII, v and c, most of IX, and X), pass a certain distance in- wards, and for the most part also caudalwards in the nerve-centre, and there end. the ganglion rue ments from which they have grown are not shown here. They will bo found in the preceding figure.

109 THE LUNGS. FORMATION OF THE GLANDS OF THE ALIMENTARY CANAL. Under this head may be included not only those organs which are ordinarily so termed, but also the lungs, and the thymus and thyroid bodies, since the early development of these three organs resembles that of the true secreting glands. All the organs above enumerated are formed as epithelial involutions, either solid at first and afterwards becoming hollowed out, or hollow from the first. As these epithelial buds grow into the mesoblast, they may either bifurcate or give off lateral branches, and in this manner all the ramifications of the ducts of the compound racemose glands are produced. The blind extremities generally end eventually in enlarged tabular or saccular dilatations. All the epithelium of the gland-saccules and ducts is derived from the original epithelial sprout, while the basement membranes and connective tissue and blood-vessels of the gland are derived from the surrounding mesoblast. The salivary glands and most other glands of the mouth, and part of the hypophysis, which must also be reckoned as a glandular development, are formed in this way by involution of the buccal or stomodaeal epiblast; while the lungs, liver, pancreas, thyroid, thymus, and all the small glands of the rest of the alimentary canal are formed of involutions of the hypoblast. The development of the teeth, which also first make their appearance as involutions of stomodmal epiblast (enamel germs), will be described after their structure has been dealt with (in the part of this work which is devoted to Splanchnology). The lungs—The lungs begin to develope from the ventral part of the pharynx at its junction with the oesophagus, in the beginning of the third day in the chick, Three buds are seen on the right side, two on the left.

30 EARLY CHANGES IN THE BLASTODERM. EARLY CHANGES IN THE BLASTODERM, RESULTING IN THE FORMATION OF THE EMBRYO. FIRST APPEARANCE OF THE EMBRYO; FORMATION OF THE NEURAL GROOVE AND MESOBLASTIC SOMITES. Neural canal.—The blastoderm in mammals, as we have seen, eventually completely encloses the cavity of the ovum, and even in the large telolecithal ovum of the bird, it gradually extends so as to cover a large part of the yolk. But only a small portion of this membrane takes part in the formation of the body of the embryo, that portion namely which lies immediately in front of the primitive groove, and it is here that what may be regarded as the first trace of the embryo makes its appearance—very soon after the outgrowth of mesoblast from the sides of that Fig. 30.—Embryonic area, with outline of part of the vascular area, from a rabbits ovum of seaten days. (From Kollilcer.) oo, vascular area ; ay, embryonic area ; pr, primitive streak and groove ; rf, medullary groove. groove-in the form of a shallow furrow (fig. 30, rf), wide behind where it embraces the anterior end of the primitive streak, and at first narrow in front, and bounded on either side and anteriorly by a fold of epiblast; which folds, in fact, Fig. 31.—Section across the anterior part of the medullary groove of an early embryo OF THE GUINEA FIG. (E. A. S.) cpi folds of epiblast rising up on either side of the middle line, and thus bounding* the mcdullai} groove; mg, middle of medullary groove; hy, hypoblast, which is in contact with the medullary epiblast at the middle of the groove, hut is elsewhere separated from it by mesoblast, me, which has burrowed forwards between the two primary layers. A cleft is seen in the mesoblast on either side ; this is the commencement of the anterior part of the ccelom.

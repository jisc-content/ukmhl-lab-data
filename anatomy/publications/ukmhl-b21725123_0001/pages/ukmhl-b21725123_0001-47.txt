39 HEART A ED VASCULAR SYSTEM. end of the single tubular heart bifurcates at an obtuse angle to form two large venous roots { primitive veins), which receive the blood from the vascular area on the yolk-sac when this is developed, and pass it on to the heart. These two primitive veins become the vitelline veins. The heart begins to beat very soon after its appearance, even whilst still filled only with a colourless fluid, and before receiving blood from the vascular area. Fig. 42.â€”Vascular area of the rabbit of 10 days. (y. Beneden and Julin.) The arteries and arterial capillaries are represented red, the venous capillaries and veins blue. Afterwards, when receiving and propelling the red blood from that area, and especially after it has become elongated and bent upon itself, it is one of the most prominent objects seen on examining the embryo ; projecting as it does freely into the yet widely open coelom immediately behind and beneath the cephalic region of the body. The first vessels to be developed are formed in mesoblast altogether outside the body and within a circular area (vascular area), which surrounds the developing embryo for a certain distance. The first appearance of red blood occurs in the form of isolated red points (blood-islands of Pander), which are scattered about within this area, and arc especially numerous at its circumference, where they form an

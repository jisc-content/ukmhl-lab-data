26 MESENCHYME THEORY OE HERTW1G. late years it lias obtained, in its modified foi-m as above given, the adherence of many embryologists, and especially of R. and 0. Hertwig, Kupifer, KoRmann, and Waldeyer. R. and 0. Hertwig have given the name of mesenchyme to Iiis's parablast, while retaining the designation of middle germinal layer or mesoderm for the rest of the mesoblast, from which it differs (1) in its structure, consisting of loosely arranged wandering cells, as distinguished from the epithelium-like lamellae, of which according to their description the rest of the mesoderm is composed ; (2) in its derivation, arising as separate cells from the entoderm instead of in the form of a coherent layer ; and (i!) in its further development and destination, giving origin to the connective tissues and blood-vessels, and perhaps to the plain muscular tissue, whereas the mesoderm proper gives origin to the skeletal muscles and to the epithelium of the saious cavities, and of the genital and urinary organs. They describe the true mesoderm as consisting of two epithelial lamelke, which form distinct layers of the blastoderm, so that according to this view the complete blastoderm would consist of four layers (epiblast, outer or somatic mesoblast, inner or splanchnic mesoblast and hypoblast) besides the mesenchyme ; to which must be added a median strand of cells set aside for the formation of the notochord. It appears evident from the researches of Kowalevsky in Sagitta and Amphioxus that what is to be regarded as the typical origin of the mesoblast in Metazoa1 takes the form of a pair of diverticula from the primitive archenteric cavity (fig. 28, la ; fig. 29, I), which hollow diverti- cula become pinched off from the remainder of that cavity, and, their cavities becoming com- pressed laterally, are converted into the coelom or body-cavity (serous cavities of vertebrata), the two walls of this cavity on either side forming respectively the inner and outer mesodermic layers of R. and 0. Hertwig. In Sagitta, the diverticula occur in the neighbourhood of the Fig. 28.â€”Formation of mesoblastio somites in ampiiioxus, shown in longitudinal optical section.

In most vertebrates above Amphioxus the mesoblastic outgrowths are from the first solid, not hollow (although a split may early, and does eventually in any case, occur in them, the coelom being thus pro- duced), nor do they originate so distinctly from the entoderm, but arise rather at the junction 1 Except the Ccelenterata which have only the two primary layers.

DEVELOPMENT OF THE HEART. 140 --vuml>. v. Fig. 170.—SECTION THROUGH THE HEART OP A RABBIT EMBRYO AT THE STAGE SHOWN IN PIG. 169. (Born.) r.s, 1.8, right and left horns of sinus receiving from above the respective superior venie cavse ; r.au, l.au, right and left auricles ; r.v, l.v, right and left parts of the ventricle ; r.v v, l.v.v, right and left valves guarding the orifice from the right horn of the sinus into the right auricle; au.v.c, one of the two endocardial cushions which are beginning to sub-divide the common auriculo-ventricular aperture. The dotted line encloses the extent of the endocardial thickening; s', first septum superior growing down between the auricles and prolonged below by a thickening of endocardium. Close to this septum in the left auricle is seen the opening of the pulmonary vein ; s.inf, inferior septum of the ventricles. Fig. 171.—View from behinb op the heart of a human embryo op about 4 weeks, magnified. (His.) The two superior cavse, right and left, and the inferior cava are seen opening separately into the sinus which is a transversely elongated sac communicating only by a narrow orifice with the right auricle. Fig. 169.—Anterior and posterior aspect op the heart op a somewhat older rabbit embryo. (Born.) p.a, pulmonary artery ; s.r, s.l, s.tr, right and left horns and transverse part of sinus respectively; r.s.c, l.s.c, right and left superior cavse ; pc, aperture of pulmonary vein ; h.v, hepatic veins; d.v, ductus venosus ; me, mesocardium posterius. The other letters as in fig. 168. 7‘ ootv. —S.r v. r.s.c.. /

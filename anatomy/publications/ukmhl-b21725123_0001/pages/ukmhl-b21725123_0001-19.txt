FERTILIZATION. 11 Fertilization.—The ovum, after its expulsion from the Graafian follicle is received upon the fimbriated end of the Fallopian tube. The fimbrte arc covered by a prolongation of the ciliated lining of the tube, and the action of the alia serves to nropel the minute ovum into and along the tube towards the uterus. In this passage it may, if impregnation have occurred, meet with the spermatozoa, one or more of which may penetrate the zona pellucida, and fertilize the ovum It is possible in some instances for fertilization to occur on the fimbriated extremity of the tube, or in the body of the uterus, but it is probable that in most cases it happens in the tube itself. It is probable that normally only a single spermatozoon enters the vitellus If it should happen that two or more enter, normal development does not as a rule occur. Exceptions to this rale have, however, been recorded. The changes in the ovum which accompany fertilization have, like those which result in the formation of the polar globules, been studied most satisfactorily in the transparent ova of echinoderms and in Ascaris. In the former (fig. 11) the spermatozoa Fig. 11.—Fertilization op the ovijm of an echinodekji. (Selenka.) s, spermatozoon ; m.pr, male pronucleus ; f.pr, female pronucleus. 1.

According to v. Beneden’s account, the spermatozoon always enters in Ascaris at a particular part of the ovum (polar disc), at which part there is an aperture in the vitelline membrane (micropyle). When once it has passed into the ovum, this aperture becomes closed, and the head of the spermatozoon rapidly increases in size, and acquires the appearance of a nucleus which, in contra-distinction to the remains of the germinal vesicle, or female pro-nucleus, is termed the malepro-nuclcus. Soon it leaves the periphery, and passes towards the centre of the ovum in the direction of the female pro-nucleus. In its passage through the protoplasm it appears to exer- cise a peculiar attraction upon the granules in that substance, for these become arranged in its vicinity in radiating lines. The tail of the spermatozoon has in the meantime disappeared, whether by being cast oft or by blending with the protoplasm of the ovum has not certainly been made out. As the male pro-nucleus approaches the female pro-nucleus, the latter moves somewhat to meet it, and pre- sently the two pro-nuclei come into contact and together form a new nucleus, com-

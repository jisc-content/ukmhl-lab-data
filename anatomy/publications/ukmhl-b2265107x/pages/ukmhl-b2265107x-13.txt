PEEFACE. The lectures which the author delivered last winter, at King's College, and which were published in the Medical Times and Gazette in the Spring, and his paper in the last volume of the Philosophical Transactions form the basis of the present memoir. It need hardly be said, that the great expense of illus- trating his researches in the usual way would have precluded the author from bringing them forward in a separate form; moreover, the sale of a work Hke the present must necessarily be very small, as the subject can only be interesting to a limited number of readers. Feel- ing the necessity of illustrations, he determined, to attempt, although against the advice of some, to take photographs of his drawings. For the success which has attended this effort he is mainly indebted to the assistance and encouragement he has received from several friends who are interested in photography. The author sees great reason to hope that the plan which has been adopted mil be found of great practical utility in illustrating scientific treatises, of which only a few copies are required. In those cases, however, where a considerable number is wanted, the expense of photo- gi-aphs would be much greater than that of engravings, and the length of time required to print them forms a considerable obstacle to their use on a large scale. b

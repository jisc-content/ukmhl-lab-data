The lai'ge portal vein is formed by tlie union of the veins of the stomach and intestines, the pancreatic and splenic veins, and the veins of the mesentery, omentum, and gall-bladder. The larger trunks of the portal vein pursue their course in the portal canals, as has been described in page 18. The smaller branches may be said, in general terms, to be arranged round the lobules. These often give off twigs to the neighbouring lobules in a stellate manner. The branches upon different sides do not anastomose so as to encircle each lobule with a venous ring, as many authors, following Kiernan's figures, have described and represented, but communicate with each other only through the intervention of capillaries, as Bowman, Kdlliker, and some other observers have stated. Gerlach, on the other hand, gives drawings of these anas- tomosing trunks, the diameter of which he represents as the same round the entire circumference of the lobule. I have not been able to demonstrate such an appearance by any mode of prepa- ration. Even in the pig there is no vascular ring, although to the unaided eye it might appear so. Interlobular branches of the portal vein in the pig's liver are represented in fig. 10. The draw- ing gives a good idea of their general arrangement. The capilla- ries are only partially injected. In the liver of the human subject, and in livers allied to it, small branches of the portal vein can

IVriNUTE ANATOMY OF THE LIVElt. 64 quite unable to explain a number of appearances which I have often seen; and I have been led to a totally different conclusion upon this point, as has been fully discussed. That view seems to me to be the only one, with reference to the termination of the ducts, compatible with the facts which have been observed. When the ducts are injected, according to the method described in Chap. I., the epithelium and the injection may be seen very distinctly with a quarter of an inch object-glass, in narrow tubes, often not more than the l-3000th or l-2000th of an inch in diameter, and I have never been able to satisfy myself of the existence of blind extre- mities. The investigation, however, must be admitted to be a most difficult one, and the question at issue of such a delicate nature, that I am very unwilling to convey an impression of speaking too confidently in favour of the results of my own work, or in the least degree to appear to disparage the conclusions which other ob- servers have arrived at,—no matter how essentially these conclu- sions may be at variance with my own, or how strongly I may feel convinced in my own mind of the truth of my deductions, and of the correctness of the data upon which they have been founded. Diameter of the finest Ducts.—The diameter of the finest ducts can only be obtained approximatively; for when not injected, they can only be demonstrated distinctly in fortunate specimens, and are probably somewhat narrower than during life. When injected, on the other hand, they are usually distended, and sometimes to a very considerable extent. In the pig, the smallest branches con- taining a little injection are not more than the 1-3000th of an inch in diameter; in the human subject, about 1-2500th; in the seal, 1-3000th; in some fishes, not more than l-5000th. The diameter of the cavity of the tube and the total diameter of ducts of different sizes are shown in the following Table :— E.xtemal Diameter. Internal Diameter. C -008 •004 Pig .

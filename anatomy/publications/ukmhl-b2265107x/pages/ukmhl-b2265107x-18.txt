ON Till': ANATOMY OF THE LIYEK. EXPLANATION OF THE FIGURES. The greater number of the photographs were taken from diagrams copied from the author's drawings. Many of them have been much diminished aud some are less distinct than could be wished; but it is hoped that they will in some measure aid in rendering the description, more intelligible. The dia- grams from which the photographs were taken, were copied from di-awings which had been traced from the preparations with the aid of the neutral tint glass reflector. The magnifying power has been estimated by comparison with the original objects, but it is only to be regarded as approximative. The author feels that many of the delineations are capable of improvement, aud since these have been finished he has been enabled to obtain photo- graphs which convey a much more accurate idea of the structure represented, than he at first anticipated, especially in the case of tissues in a morbid state. Fig. 1. Frontispiece.—Plan of the arrangement of the tissues in a lobule of human liver. The part represented is supposed to be a small segment of a lobule, of which the centre is seen at e, and a part of the circumference on the left of the figure. At the lower part are seen branches of the vein, artery, and duct in a small portal canal. Magnified about 120 diameters. ]). V.—Portal vein. a. Artery. d. Duct. e. Hepatic vein. The branches of the portal vein, interlobular, are seen in the upper and lower part of the figure breaking up into capillaries, which form a solid net- work throughout the entire lobule. In the meshes of this network arc con-

MINUTK ANATOMY OF THE LIVER. 72 Division of the organ into Lobules. The vessels and ducts ramifying in the portal canals are ulti- mately distributed in such a manner that they serve to divide the organ into little masses, and thus map out spaces, or lobules, each of which contains all the structural elements of the organ, and may be regarded as an elementary liver. In the intervals between the fissures by which the portal vein, artery, and duct are conducted to the lobule, its capillary vessels and its secreting structure are continuous with those of adjacent lobules. The size and form of the lobules differ much in diff'erent animals; but their essential structure is the same in all, except in the pig, in the Polar bear, according to Miiller, and in the Octodon Cummingii (one of the rodents), according to Hyrtl. In these exceptional cases the liver is divided into a number of distinct and separate lobules, each provided with a capsule of its own, just as the kidney of the porpoise and of the seal is divided into a uumber of separate renules. In the pig each lobule is provided with a separate fibrous capsule of its own, and is, therefore, completely isolated from its neighbours. Branches of the portal vein, artery, and duct run between them, and give off branches to contiguous lobules. In the intervals between the fibrous capsules areolar tissue can fre- quently be demonstrated. In aU cases, upon a section, the lobule is seen to be bounded externally by branches of the vein, artery, and duct, and in the centre is situated a small branch of the hepatic vein. Areolar Tissue in Portal Canals. In the liver of the human subject, and in that of vertebrate animals generally, with the exceptions above mentioned, the lobules are not separated from each other by any fibrous partition, and there is no areolar or fibrous tissue, or prolongation of Glisson's capsule between them, or in their interior.

DISTENSION OF THE TUBES BY INJECTION. RADIATION OF THE TUBES FROM THE CENTRE OF THE LOBULE.—DIAMETER OF THE TUBES OF THE NETAVORK. INTERVAL BETWEEN THE WALLS OF THE CAPILLARIES, AND THE MEMBRANE OF THE TUBULAR NETWORK.—CON- TENTS OF THE TUBULAR NETWORK OF BASEMENT MEM- BRANE.—CELLS.—CONTENTS OF THE CELL.—TUBULAR NET- WORK IN FISHES.—OF THE MANNER IN WHICH THE CELLS ARE ARRANGED WITHIN THE TUBULAR MEMBRANE, A LOBULE of the liver consists of a solid network of capillary vessels, in the meshes of which the liver-cells are seen. Towards the central part of the lobule, the cells assume a more linear direc- tion, and appear to radiate from the intralobular vein as from a centre. It has long been a question whether the cells simply lie in the meshes of the capillary network, or whether they are enclosed in tubes of basement membrane. The cells are prone to become detached in the form of little columns which are often branched, an appearance which is usually considered to be due to the manner in which they are fitted into the vascular meshes, and not to the presence of any tissue surrounding them, which would keep them together in this manner. In these detached masses it is not easy to demonstrate a basement membrane, and their con- nexion has been accounted for by a supposed adhesion of the cells to each other. Among the authorities who have advocated the existence of a basement membrane may be mentioned Krukeuberg, Schroder Van der Kolk, Retzius, Weber, Theile, Backer, and Leidy, while Kiernan described a lobular biliary plexus, the tubes of which were considered by him to be continuous with the ducts, nearly rive-

SUMMARY. 73 The vessels at their entrance into the liver, and as they run for some distance in the larger portal canals, are surrounded with much areolar tissue; but the disposition of this texture about the vessels of the liver is very similar to its arrangement about the larger vessels distributed to other organs. Intimate Structure of the Lobule. The lobule itself is composed of a solid capillary netvrork, and of another network composed of a very delicate tubular membrane, in which the liver cells are contained. These networks mutually intertwine with each other. The capillary network is directly continuous with the smallest interlobular branches of the portal vein, distributed upon the cir- cumference of the lobule on the one hand, and with the small intralobular branch of the hepatic vein arising in its centre upon the other. The vessels of the network converge toward the centre of the lobule. Small branches of the artery open into the venous capillaries of the lobule, near its circumference, and the diameter of these small branches is considerably less than that of the venous capil- laries into which they open; the former not more than the l-4000th of an inch in diameter, the latter about the 1-1600th. In all cases, the blood, enriched with constituents recently absorbed from the intestine, flows with a gradually increasing rapidity from the circumference of the lobule towards its centre, while the bile flows in a precisely opposite direction. Of the Liver Cells and of the Tubular Network in which they lie. The liver-cells lie within a tubular network of basement mem- brane, which separates them from the walls of the capillaries. In many cases, however, these thin membranous tubes cannot be separated, and are, no doubt, incorporated with each other. The cells are not attached to the basement membrane of the tube, but lie in its cavity. Among them free oil globules and

22 MINUTE ANATOMY OF THE LIVER. in every specimen submitted to examination, is, perhaps, greater than would be supposed from what I have just observed; by manipulation the small vessels in uninjected specimens become so altered that it would be impossible to distinguish them from fibrous tissue. On the other hand, it might be m-ged, that in injected specimens the fibrous tissue is so compressed by distended vessels as to be almost invisible. Even if this were the case, in numerous places where these vessels were slightly separated from each other, one eould hardly fail to recognize fibrous tissue if it existed. The areolar coat of the vessels and ducts is not prolonged upon the small branches which are given off firom the trunks in the larger portal canals; and, after many careful examinations of the arrangement and connexions of the vessels in the portal canals of many animals, I have been unable to observe anything in the distribution of the areolar tissue around the vessels of the liver differing from its arrangement in many other situations. The vessels of the kidney and of other glands, as is well known, are invested at their entrance, like those of the liver, with much areolar tissue, which is gradually lost as the vessels approach the secreting portion of the gland. Manner in which the mapping-out into distitict portions is p)ro- duced.â€”The cause of the mapping-out of the lobides of the liver in all animals has been considered to be due to the extensive dis- tribution of Glisson's capsule between them; but in these situ- ations, as has been already remarked, many observers like myself have altogether failed in their attempts to demonstrate such a structure, with the single exception of the pig. The fibrous appearance in the interlobulur spaces of the uninjected livers of animals generally, I have shown to be due to the collapsed state of small branches of the vein, artery, and especially of the duct, which are very numerous. The divisions, or apparent septa, between the ultimate portions of hepatic substance in the human liver (independent of altera- tions in vascular distension so well described by Kiernan) seem to be produced in part by the arrangement of the smallest branches of the duct, and partly by that of the vein and artery. In the seal and hedgehog the markings are not very distinct, and the

10 CHAPTER II. GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE LIVER.—DIMENSIONS.—BULK. WEIGHT.—SPECIFIC GRAVITY.—CHEMICAL COMPOSITION.— PORTAL CANALS.—HEPATIC VENOUS CANALS.—LOBULES OF THE PIG AND OP OTHER ANIMALS.— CAPSULE OF THE LO- BULES.—PORTAL CANALS AND INTERLOBULAR FISSURES.— GLISSON'S CAPSULE,—MANNER IN WHICH THE MAPPING OUT INTO DISTINCT PORTIONS IS PRODUCED. For much that is known of the anatomy of the liver, we are indebted to the labors of one of the greatest living anatomists, Mr. Kiernan, and almost every one is well acquainted with his most valuable researches upon the structure of this gland.* These investigations were made nearly a quarter of a century ago, at a time when the compound microscope was a very imperfect instru- ment, and principally with the aid of a lens alone. The li\'er-cells, the great agents in the secretion of bile, were hardly known, and the exact arrangement of the capillary vessels was not satis- factorily demonstrated until many years after. Yet very much of of that which Mr. Kiernan did, and the correctness of the con- clusions which he arrived at, have been fully confirmed by later investigators. The latest researches appear to militate most strongly against the inferences of Mr. Kiernan with reference to the manner in which the ducts commence; but there is, I think, little doubt, that he was, in the main, right, and the conclusions which I have arrived at in investigating many of my own preparations were foreshadowed by him at a time when the means of observation were very imperfect in comparison to those which we may now employ. Dimensions, Weight, and Chemical Composition of the Healthy Jjiver.—The liver in health measures about 12 inches from side to side, and 6 or 7 in its antero-posterior diameter. Its bulk corres- ponds to neai'ly 100 cubic inches, and its weight varies from 3 to 4 pounds, according to the quantity of blood which it may contain • On the Anatomy and Physiology of the Liver.

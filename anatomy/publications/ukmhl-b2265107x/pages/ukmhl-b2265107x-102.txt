50 MINUTE ANATOMY OF THE LIVER. In the only embryos of mammalia which I have examined, more than one row of cells is contained within the tube, and two or three are commonly met with (human foetus, foetus of ox). Tlie cells are smaller than in the adult liver, the tubes not unfrequently being larger. In birds also (linnet, turkey, starling, fowl), two or three cells lie within the tube in some places, but in others only one is met with. In the embryo-chick numerous rows of cells are seen lying across the tube. In those reptiles which I have observed, there are often several cells lying across the tube (frog, adder, field-snake); in fishes, so far as my observation goes, there is also room for many rows of cells (flounder, frog-fish, sturgeon, herring, cod, &c.). It may be said, generally, that the tubes are most narrow amongst mammalia, and widest amongst fishes. The cells also are well defined in the former, but not often demonstrable in the latter class. The similarity of the arrangement of the cells in the tubes of the embryos of man and the higher animals, with the embryonic, as well as the permanent, condition which they assume in the lower vertebrata, and in many of the invertebrata, is a point which must excite great interest, and is one which has a parallel in the case of other glands and many tissues. There is perhaps no more striking example of this gradual progress from the lower and simpler form of structure to the higher and more elaborate than the one here adduced.

SUMMARY. 75 As the ducts increase in size they are provided with a fibrous coat, and the epitheUum in their interior becomes columnar. The interlobular ducts do not anastomose. Sacculi in the Coats of the Ducts. When the fibrous coat reaches a certain degree of thickness it contains numerous little cavities, or sacculi, arranged entirely round the tube in the pig and in most animals, but forming two parallel rows, one on either side of the duct, in the human subject. These little sacculi often communicate with each other in the coats of the duct. The smaller branches of the duct also anasto- mose frequently, either in the coats of the duet or just external to them. The sacculi appear to serve the purpose of bringing the bile in th-e thick walled ducts into closer relation with the vessels which surround them, and especially with the branches of the artery which are distributed to their coats. Of the Vasa Aberrantia and of the arrangement of the Vessels around them. In the transverse fissure of the human liver and some others, and in the large portal canals, are found some peculiar branches of the duct, vasa aberrantia, with numerous sacculi on their walls, which anastomose with each other and form a network. In the same localities in the human subject, and in the gall- bladder, a very peculiar arrangement of the vessels occurs. Both arteries and veins form a network, and each branch of the artery is accompanied with two branches of the vein, one on either side of it.

MINUTE ANATOMY OF THE LIVER. 66 tissues of the liver, so as to form minute portions resembling each other, or lobules, the most complete changes in the circulating blood are ensured, while the circulation is retarded in the least possible degree compatible with the alteration to be produced; and at the same time the anatomical elements, through the inter- vention of which these changes are effected, are combined in such a manner as to occupy the smallest possible amount of space. The cells in all parts of the network have, no doubt, the power of forming bile, but in different degrees; those quite close to the centre of the lobule, have often been observed to be filled with yellow granules. There is no reason for supposing that the secretion is passed from cell to cell, and at last into the duct; for if this were the case, we should at least expect to find greater difference in the cells near the ducts than really exists; and it must be remembered that in many animals in a state of per- fect health, no difference whatever is to be demonstrated. The ceDs at the cu-cumference of the lobules of the human liver usually contain a much larger quantity of oil than those nearer the centre, which is just what we should anticipate when we con- sider that the portal blood, rich with the freshly absorbed con- stituents of the food, first reaches these marginal cells. The direction of the cu'culation is the reverse of that which we should expect to find if the secretion were transmitted from cell to cell, as most authorities in the present day insist upon. For if this â– were really the case, it seems to me that we should be forced to admit that the blood flowed through the superficial part of the capillary network to no purpose. On the other hand, the anatomy of the organ almost forces upon us the conclusion, that the cells nearest to the duct take the most active part in the secretion, and that the blood gets gradually rendered more free of substances from which the bile is formed, as it travels along the capillaiy tubes from circumference to centre, with a gradually increasing rapidity of movement. Lastly, the assumed absence of any channel in which bile could flow, ceases to be a tenable objection, since it has been shown to be comparatively easy, provided that certain precautions be observed in conducting the operation, to force injection into a channel which does exist. For if, by ai'tificial means, fluid can be made to puss in an opposite dii-ection, within the tubes of this

EXAMINATION OF SPECIMENS. 9 appear confused and indefinite. The seetions should bear exami- nation with a quarter or eighth of an inch object-glass. It is, of course, very difficult, and, in great measure, a matter of chance, to obtain a section including the course of the smallest duct, and it will often be necessary to examine very many sections before a demonstrative specimen can be obtained. When we consider how difficult it is to obtain a section of the mammalian kidney, showing, even for a short distance, the convolutions of a single uriniferous tube, it need not excite surprise that it is rare to obtain a section of the liver, which shows clearly the termina- tion of the smallest branches of the duct, for these tubes in passing only a very short distance, often occupy many very different planes. The circumstances which render the demonstra- tion of the com-se of the ui'iniferous tube very difficult, operate still more forcibly in the case of the liver, as the tubes are very much smaller, the tissue of which they are composed infinitely more delicate, and the entire organ so soft that veiy slight mani- pulation is sufficient entirely to destroy the relative positions of the anatomical elements of w^hich it is composed.

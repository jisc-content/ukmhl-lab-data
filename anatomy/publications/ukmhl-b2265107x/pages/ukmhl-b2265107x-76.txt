24 MINUTE ANATOMY OF THE LIVER. and become coutinuous with the capillaries aud cell-containing network of which the secreting structure is composed. The interlobular spaces are enormously increased in extent in certain cases of disease where the liver-cells at the margin of the lobule have degenerated. This increase, of course, takes place at the expense of the secreting structure of the lobules, which in a section are seen to be much diminished in size. I have a speci- men of diseased liver in which the interlobular spaces are as wide as the lobules. That this increased extent, is due to an alteration in the secreting structure of the lobule is certain, because the net- work which originally contained cells can be distinctly traced, and in many situations contains biliary particles. Such a specimen would have been formerly described as produced by a thickening of Glisson's capsule. The interlobular spaces then are occupied only by branches of the vessels and duct which lie in close proximity to each other, and no structure corresponding to the description of Glisson's capsule is to be detected in this situation. With reference to the physiological arrangement of the ele- mentary tissues of which the gland is composed, it may, I think, be said that the livers of aU vertebrate animals are arranged so as to form more or less isolated portions, or lobules; but in a strictly anatomical sense, the term must be confined to the liver of the pig, since it is only in this animal that the individual lobules can be separated from one another.

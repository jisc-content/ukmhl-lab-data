vl rRRFACE. For the illustration of scientific subjects the necessary exactness of photographs offers great advantages, and some anatomical structures may be delineated far more like nature in this manner than by engraving. The illus- trations in the present volume must not be regarded, by any means, as the most perfect which can be obtained ; indeed, several which have since been made have caused the author to become very dissatisfied with those pub- lished, many of which were taken from diagrams rather carelessly copied from his drawings. Lately some photo- graphs have been taken directly from the original drawings of specimens of diseased livers in every respect far superior to any in the present volume. Some copies have also been obtained from the objects themselves, which the author hopes to publish at some future time. In spite of the help and valuable instruction he has received from many kind friends, especially from Mr. Hardwich and from his friend and pupil, Mr. JuHus Pollock, the author can only look upon himself as a most indifferent photographer, with a very few months' expe- rience ; and he feels that some apology is due from him to those more skilful and experienced than himself, for the wrong he has done their beautiful art, in bringing forward some decidedly bad pictures in a photographic point of view. These delineations may, nevertheless, be sufficiently good to render his views upon the structure of the liver intelligible ; for without illustrations, he fears it would be almost impossible for any one to understand his meaning. Several of the best negatives were kindly taken by Mr. Pollock. The prints have been worked off in the author's private laboratory. It may be interesting here to give an account of the

The organ was taken from the body of a man 31 years of age, who was kUled by falling from a second-floor window while in the enjoyment of perfect health. Water Solid matter Fatty matter Albumen ...

In fatty degeneration an enormous amount of fatty matter may accumulate in the organ. In one remarkable case, I obtained from a liver 75 "07 per cent, of solid matter, and of this 6.5-19 consisted of fatty matter.* In scrofulous degene- ration of the Hver, the albuminous materials and the water are increased, while the fatty matter is diminished in quantity. The liver is essentially composed of certain elementary struc- tures, which are common to all secreting organs possessing ducts, although in the different glands these structures are variously modi- fied to serve special ends, which differ in each individual organ. These essential structural elements are the following:â€”Cells, lying in a cavity composed of basement membrane, which have the power of separating certain peculiar substances from the blood, for which alone they have any attraction. Vessels, which bring the blood into close proximity with the cells, and Efferent Ducts, in direct continuity with the cavity in which the secreting cells are contained, which carry off the secretion after it has been elabo- rated. It is impossible to help being forcibly struck with the manner in which these anatomical elements are arranged in this organ, for the same disposition of the parts which economizes material and * Diseases of the Liver.

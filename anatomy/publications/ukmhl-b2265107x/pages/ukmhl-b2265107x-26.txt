XX EXPLANATION OF TFIR FIGUHES. Magnified 160 diameters. Fig. 63.—Portion of oell-coutaining network of the Guinea-pig. Fig. 64.—Small branches of duct and their connexion with cell-containing network. From the sturgeon. Injected with Prussian blue. Magnified 35 diameters. h. Portion of ceU-containiug network much distended with oil globules. From the sturgeon. c. Small branch of duct at its junction with one of the large tubes, X. Remnants of capillary vessels. Magnified 200 diameters. Fig. 65.—Branches of duct and ceU-containiug network from the firog-fish (Lophius piscatorias). d. Ducts injected with Prussian blue. Natural size. e f i. Portions of cell-containing network. g h k. Minute ducts and branches to network. The shading shows the extent to which the injection has passed. I. Portion of trunk of small duct showing epithelium in its interior. m. Portion of duct with epithelium in its interior. The waUs are com- posed of an outer layer of longitudinal fibres, and an inner layer con- sisting of circular fibres, probably muscular. e g liikl m. Magnified 150 diameters. Fig. 66.—Ducts and ceU-containing network, from the liver of the flounder. a. Small duct with branches. I c d e. Smaller branches continuous with cell-containing network, with a few crystals in the interior of the one marked b. f. Part of tube of network. g. Capillaries of lobule much contracted and irregular from the mode of preparing the specimen. h. Tubes of cell-containing network with biliary matter precipitated in the form of a highly refractive substance, in the interior. In many situations the mass has broken, and the fragments have become sepa- rated from each other by a short interval, the tube of basement mem- brane having remained entire, as represented at i.

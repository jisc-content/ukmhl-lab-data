MINUTE ANATOMY OF THE LIVER. CHAPTER I. OF THE METHOD OF INVESTIGATION,—HARDENING THE LIVER. —SYRUP.—^ALCOHOL AND SODA; THEIR USE IN RENDERING ALBUMINOUS TISSUES TRANSPARENT.—METHOD OF INJECT- ING THE DUCTS OF THE LIVER AND THE HEPATIC CELL- CONTAINING NETWORK. — OPAQUE INJECTIONS.—TRANSPA- RENT INJECTIONS.—PRUSSIAN BLUE.—DIRECTIONS FOR IN- JECTING THE DUCTS OF A LIVER FOR EXAMINATION WITH HIGH POWERS OF THE MICROSCOPE.—PREPARING THE IN- JECTING FLUID.—OF INJECTING THE VEINS WITH PLAIN SIZE.—PREPARATION OF SPECIMENS PREVIOUS TO EXAMINA- TION IN THE MICROSCOPE. In the following inquiry I have employed several methods of investigation which differ in many important particulars, as far as 1 am able to ascertain, from those which have been followed by other observers. As I believe that my success is to be attributed solely to the methods employed in the inquiry, it seems to me important that they should be described in detail before the results of the investigations are referred to. METHOD OF PREPARING SPECIMENS TO SHOW THE CONTINUITY OF THE DUCTS WITH THE CELL-CONTAINING NETWORK. I have not found it possible to demonstrate very satisfactorily the arrangement of the ducts and cell-containing network of the liver, without previous preparation, although I have succeeded in' making it out, in some instances, in perfectly fresh specimens examined in glycerine. The difficulty of deciding the point in recent preparations need not excite surprise if the extreme soft- ness of the hver and tlie difficulty of cutting thin sections B

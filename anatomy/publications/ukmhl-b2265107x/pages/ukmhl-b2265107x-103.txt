51 CHAPTER V. OP THE ULTIMATE RAMIFICATIONS OF THE DUCTS, AND OF THEIR CONNEXION WITH THE CELL-CONTAINING NETWORK. —ANASTOMOSES OF THE DUCTS.—OF THE FINEST BRANCHES OF THE DUCTS, AND OF THEIR JUNCTION WITH THE SECRETING TUBES OF THE CELL-CONTAINING NETWORK; MAMMALIA ; BIRDS ; REPTILES ; FISHES. — EPITHELIUM OF THE SMALLER DUCTS.—DR. HANDFIELD JONEs' VIEWS. Numerous observers, who have carefully investigated the matter,, differ widely in the conclusions they have arrived at with regard to the manner in wliich the most minute ducts commence in the liver; and are at issue with reference to their mode of con- nexion with the secreting structure, and the precise relation which they bear to the secreting cells. In his valuable paper published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1833, Mr. Kiernan describes and figures the anastomoses between branches of the hepatic ducts in the left triangular ligament of the human liver. He also refers to communications existing between the ducts in other situations, as in the membranous bridge stretching over the fissure of the um- bilical vein, and upon the inferior surface of the diaphragm. In the same paper, this author gives a diagram of the manner in which he supposed the ducts to terminate in the lobules of the liver, and subjoins the following remarks :—"No such view of the ducts as that represented in this figure can be obtained in the liver. The interlobular ducts are in the figure seen anastomosing with each other. I have never seen these anastomoses, but I have seen the anastomoses of the ducts in the left lateral ligament, and, from the results of experiments related in this paper, I believe the interlobular ducts anastomose; I have never injected the lobular biliary plexus to the extent represented in this figure." Since the appearance of this important communication, the subject has been much investigated both in this country and on the continent; but, as far as I can ascertain, no observer has yet succeeded in demonstratiny the manner in which the ducts E 2

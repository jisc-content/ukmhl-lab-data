269 BRACHIAL ARTERY. artery are the following :-The and wm. ¥\s. 77. 7 * encircling it with branches, and the median basilic vein crosses over it at the elbow. The basilic vein is near, and inside the artery above, but is superficial to the fascia in the lower half of the arm The nerves in relation with the internal cutaneous (") is in contact with the vessel until it perfo- rates the fascia about the middle of the arm. The ulnar ners^e {^) lies to the inner side as far as the insertion of the coraco-brachialis muscle ; and the mus- culo-spiral (fig. 69, is behind for a dis- tance of two inches. The median nerve (') is close to the vessel throughout, but alters its position in this way :—as low as the insertion of the coraco- brachialis it is placed on the outer side, but it then crosses ob- liquely either over or under the artery, and becomes internal about two inches above the elbow joint. Peculiarities in posi- tum. The brachial trunk may leave the inner border of the biceps in the lower half of the arm, and course along the intermuscular geptum, with or without the median nerve, to the inner condyle of the hu- merus. At this spot the vessel is directed to its ordinary position in front of the elbow, either through or beneath the fibres of the pronator teres, which has then a wide Deviation in position * Axillary and brachial arteries and their branches. (Quain's "Arteries.") —1. Axillary .artery and branches : the small branch above the figure is the highest thoracic, and the larger branch close below, the acromial thoracic. 2. Long thoracic branch. 3. Subscapular branch. 4. Brachial artei'y and branches. 5. Sui)erior profunda branch. 6. Inferior profunda branch. 7. Anastomotic branch. 8. Biceps muscle. 9. Triceps muscle. The median and ulnar nerves are shown in the arm ; the median is close to the brachial artery.

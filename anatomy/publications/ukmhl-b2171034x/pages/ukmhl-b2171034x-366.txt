The aorta has its origin in the left ventricle, and curving backwards over the windpipe and the gullet, forms an arch which ceases on the left side of the spinal column' at the lower border of ^'S- 105.* the fifth dorsal vertebra. The arch has its con- vexity upwards and to the right, and its con- cavity to the root of the left lung ; and from it the large vessels for the supply of the upper part of the body take their origin. For the purpose of reducing to order the numerous con- nections of this portion of the aorta, it is divided into thi-ee parts—as- cending, transverse, and descending. The Jirst or ascending part is about two inches in length, or slightly more, and is directed upwards behind, and close to the sternum : it reaches as high as the upper border of the cartilage of the second rib on the right side, and is contained nearly altogether in the peri- cardium. At first the pulmonary artery is superficial to it ; but, as the vessels take different directions, the arch is soon uncovered, and remains so to its termination. Behind it are the right branches of the pulmonary vessels. On the right side is the descending cava ; and on the left, the pulmonary artery. Near the heart the vessel bulges opposite the semilunar valves (fig. 105). There is some- times another dilatation along the right side, which is named the gi'eat sinus of the aorta. The second or transverse portion recedes from the sternum and reaches from the second right costal cartilage to the left side of the body of the fourth dorsal vertebra (the lower border). It rests upon the trachea above the bifurcation, and is placed over the oesophagus and the thoracic duct. Lying in front of this piece of the artery are the vagus, phrenic, and superficial cardiac nerves of the left side,—the first nerve sending backwards its recurrent branch beneath the vessel. Along the upper border is the left innominate * Arch of the aorta and its great vessels, a. Aortic arch. 6. Innominate arteiy. c. Left common carotid, d. Left subclavian, e.

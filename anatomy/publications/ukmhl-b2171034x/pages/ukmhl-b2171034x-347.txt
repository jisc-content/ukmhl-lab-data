BOOT OF LUNG. S31 lung. Occasionally there may be a trace of the tliird lobe in the BesTlS the difference in the number of the lobes, the right lung f^^^^l^^H^ is larger and heavier, and is wider and more hollowed out at the size of the base than the left; it is also shorter by an inch. The mcreased i^^g â€¢ length and the narrowness of the left lung are due to the absence Fig. 97.* of a large projecting body like the liver under it, and to the du-ec- tion of the heart to the left side. The root of the lung consists of the vessels entering the fissm-e on Root of the the inner surface ; and as these are botmd together by the pleura ^"^"S- and some areolar tissue they form a foot-stalk, which fixes the lung to the heart and the windpipe. The root is situate at the imier situation, surface, about midway between the base and apex, and about a third of the breadth from the posterior border of the lung. In front of the root on both sides, are the phrenic and the anterior Connec- pulmonary nerves, the former being at some little distance from it; and anterior to the right root is the descending cava. Behind on both sides, is the posterior pulmonic plexus ; and on the left side there is, in addition, the descending aorta. Above on the right side is the vena azygos ; and on the left side, the arch of the aorta. Below each root is the fold of pleura called ligamentum latum pulmonis. In the root of the lung are collected a branch of the pulmonary consti- artery, two pulmonary veins, and a division of the air tube (bronchus); jJIg'^og^*! * Diagram to show the difference in the anterior border of the right and left lung, the edge being indicated by the dark line ; and to mark the different level of the base on the two sides.

♦ MEDIAN NERVE AND BRANCHES. 293 of the short flexor, and ends in the abductor and opponens pollicis " The ^ioital nerves C) are five in number. Three of them which are distributed to the sides of the thumb and the radial ide of the fore finger, are undivided, and come fi-om the external the two pieces into which the trunk of the median sphts. ihe other two spring from the inner piece of the nerve, and are bifur- cated to supply the opposed sides of the middle and fore, and the middle and ring fingers.

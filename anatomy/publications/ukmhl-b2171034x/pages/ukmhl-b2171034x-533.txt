517 EXCRETORY TUBES OF KIDNEY. bedded in tlic cortical substance, and is resolved into bundles of tubes which are prolonged into the cortical covering. Each pyramidal mass is constracted of uriniferal tubes (tubes of Composi- Bellini) which open below at the apex of the papilla (fig. 1G2, a) ; and the cut surface has a grooved appearance indicatory of its construction. If the mass is compressed, urine will exude from the tubes through the apertures in the apex. The cortical or investing part (hg. IGl, e) forms abput three- ^j;;^^^*" fourths of the kidney ; it covers the pyramidal masses with a layer subntance; about two lines in thickness, and sends prolongations between the same nearly to their apices. Its colour is of a light red, unless the colour; Iddney is blanched ; and its consistence is so slight that the mass consistence, gives way beneath the finger. In the injected kidney red points (Jlalpighian bodies) are scattered througli the cortex, giving it a gi-anular appearance. Structure of the Kidney. The mass of the kidney consists of ^^^^^^^^ ,^ minute convoluted tubes, intermixed Avith bloodvessels, Ijoiiphatics, a iibrous nerves, and an intertubular matrix. The whole is incased by a fibrous coat. The fibrous coat is a white layer, which is connected with the Fibrous kidney by fine processes and vessels, and is readily detached from '^'^'^^ it by slight force. At the inner margin of the Iddney it sinks into sends in the sinus, and sends processes on the entering vessels and excretory duct. Stroma or matrix. Between the tubules and the vessels of the Matrix of Iddney is a uniting material, which surrounds and isolates them, '^"^^"^^J- and is most abundant in the cortical substance. It somewhat re- sembles areolar tissue in its nature, and is fibrous at some spots. To obtain a knowledge of the anatomy of the secreting tubes, and of the bloodvessels, the dissector will require a microscope, and good fine injections of the kidney. Secretory tubules. The uriniferous tubes (tubuli uriniferi) occupy Uriniferous successively the cortical substance, and the Malpighian pp-amids; ^^^^^'^^ • but they have a different an-angement in each, as is delineated *','.f"nge- below (fig. 1G2, a). inent. In the Malpi(jldan pyramid the tubes are straight, and ascend I" the from the apertures in the apex, bifurcating repeatedly, as far as pjfraluki'f' the base, and forming a cone which resembles the stem and branches of a tree. At the wide end of the pyramid they are collected into size ami bundles which reach nearly to the surface of the Iddney, and be- <^'"^'"°'> come convoluted as they enter the cortex, but some unite in arches (Henle). Near the apex they measure -3-^0^1 of an incli across, but the last subdivisions are only half that size, or of an inch. Descending between the straight tubes are the small " looped mixeil witli tubes " of Henle (fig. 1G2, rj). These run down from the cortical He};f,."^ substance nearly to the apex of the pyramid, where they turn up- ' wards, forming loops with the convexity down, and ascend to open whioU aro into the straight tubes : their size is about a third of the others. '^'""U. In the cortical substance the tubes are more numerous and very in tiin convoluted (fig. 1G3) ; they have an average width of -i^th of an ™bstaioe

ANATOMY OF FEMORAL HEENIA. 618 turned inwards, and the fat removed, the tube on the vessels (crural sheath) will be brought into view as it descends beneath Poupart's ligament. With the handle of the scalpel the crural sheath is to be separated Ddme carefully fi-om the fascia lata beneath, from Poupart's Ugament in ^ • front, and fi'om Gimbernat's ligament on the inner side. FoiiparCs ligament (fig. 192, or the crural arch, is the firm The crural band of the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle of the ^^^j^ abdomen, which stretches fi'om the fi-ont of the iliac crest to the ,nents pubes (p. 444). When viewed on the surface, the arch is cun^ed form: downwai-ds towards the limb, whilst the fascia lata remains on the tliigh. The outer half is oblique. But the inner half is almost horizontal, and widens as it approaches the pubes, where it is in- serted into the pubic spine and pectineal line of the hip bone, forming Gimbernat's ligament. The space between the crural arch and the iimominate bone is Pyhoiiow larger in the female than in the male, and is closed by parts passing beneath, fi-om the abdomen to the thigh. The outer half of the intei-val is filled by the fleshy psoas and iliacus muscles, to which the arch is closely bound by fascia ; and the inner half is occupied by the femoral vessels and their sheath. Gimhemafs ligament, or the piece of the tendon of the external Gimbernat's oblique muscle which is inserted into the pectineal line, is about three-fomihs of an inch in length, and is triangular in shape. Its apex is at the pubic spine ; whilst its base is in contact with the form and craral sheath, and is joined by the fascia lata. By one margin connections, (anterior) it is continuous with the crural arch, and by the opposite it is fixed to the pectineal line. In the erect position of the body the ligament is almost horizontal. The crural sheath (fig. 192, ■^)is a loose tube[of membrane around Crural the femoral vessels. It has the form of a funnel, sloped unequally on the sides. The wide part or base of the tube is upwards : and ^^^^ the nan-ow part ceases about two inches below Poupart's ligament, tious, by blending with the common areolar sheath of the bloodvessels. Its outer border is nearly straight, and is perforated by the genito- crural nerve Q). Its inner border is oblique, and is pierced by lymphatics, superficial vessels, and the saphenous vein (/) ; tliis part of the sheath appears in the saphenous opening, and is con- nected to the falciform margin and the superficial fascia. In fi-ont of the crm-al sheath and behind it is the fascia lata of the thigh. The sheath is continuous with the fascire lining the abdomen in how formed this way ;—the anterior part is prolonged beneath Poupart's liga- ment into the fascia transversalis, and the posterior half is contmued into the fascia iliaca (p. 464). Crossing the front of the sheath beneath the arch of Poupart's Deep crural ligament, is a fibrous band, the deep crwal arch. A notice of it is included in the description of the fascia transversalis (p. 453). Dissection (fig. 192). The student is to open the sheath by an Open the mcision across the front, and to raise the loose anterior part with ^j^^Ji hooks. Inside the tube are contained the femoral vessels, each ^ "^'^

OBTUEATOE NERVE AND BRANCHES. C33 articular artery, and occasionally one to the under surface of the pectineus. , , ,, i The ADDUCTOR BREVis (fig. 196, ^) has a thin fleshy and aponeu- Adductor rotic attachment, ahout two inches in depth, to the fi-ont of the hip thin at the bone with the gracilis. The muscle arises from the pubic border of the bone close to and outside the gracilis, reaching upwards as liigh as the adductor longus, and not quite so low as the graciUs. It is inserted, behind the pectineus, into all the line leading fi-om the JIJ^j^^']^.''* linea aspera to the small trochanter. tion. In front of the muscle are the pectineus and the adductor longus, Parts in Avith the superficial piece of the obturator nerve, and the profunda artery ; but it is gradually uncovered by the adductor longus below, and the contiguous borders of the two are side by side at their in- sertion into the femur. Behind the muscle is the adductor magnus, beliind, with the deep piece of the obturator nen-^e and a branch of the inner circumflex artery. In contact with the upper border lies the obturator extemus, F, and the internal circumflex artery passes between the two. Action. Tliis muscle adducts the limb with slight flexion of the JJ^°,2!fygg hip joint, like the pectineus. And if it acts fi-om the femur it will ^ ^^^^ ' balance and move fon^'ards the pehas. The OBTURATOR NERVE (fig. 196, ^) is a branch of the lumbar 0^'^*™'^*^°^ plexus (p. 543), and supplies the adductor muscles of the thigh, as Avell as the hip and knee joints. The nerve issues fi-om the pehas through the apertm-e in the upper part of the thyroid foramen ; and |uto uvo^ it divides in that opening into two pieces, which are named super- ficial and deep from their position with respect to the adductor brevis muscle. A. The superficial part Q) of the nerve is directed over the adduc- flcf^f pait" tor bi'evis, but beneath the pectineus and the adductor longus, to ends on the femoral artery, on which it is distributed ; at the lower border of the last muscle it furnishes an offset or two to join in a plexus joins plexus with the internal cutaneous and saphenous nerves (p. 628), and in the thigh: supply the teguments.* In the aperture of exit, this piece of the nen'-e sends outwards an to'^^p'^oinT articular twig to the hip joint with the joint-artery. Muscular branches are furnished to the adductor longus, the ad- muscular to ductor brevis, and the gracilis. adductors. B. The deep piece (^) of the obturator nerve pierces the fibres of Sfe Se^vf °* the external obturator muscle, and, continuing beneath the adductor brevis, is consumed chiefly in the adductor magnus. The following offsets are supplied by it:— ^ Muscular branches enter the obturator extemus as the nerve adductor pierces it ; others are furnished to the large, and sometimes to the magnus, .short adductor. A slender articular branch (fig. 196, *) enters the fibres of the and gives adductor magnus, and passes through this near the linea aspera to kMetoint * In some bodies the superficial part of the nerve is of large size, and has a <listribution similar to tliat of the inner branch of the internal cutaneous nerve, whose place it takes : in such instances it joins freely iu the plc.\us.

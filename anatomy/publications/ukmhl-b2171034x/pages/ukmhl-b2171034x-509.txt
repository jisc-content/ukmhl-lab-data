493 STRUCTURE OF STOMACH. The circular fibres (fig. 145, I) forn; the 2'^^^;^^^' ^^^^ he best seen by removing the longitudinal fibres neai the pylo.us !^le7re h f^m the lefrto the right end of the Btomach ; bu at the pylorus they are most numerous and strongest, and form a rmg or sphincter (c) around the openmg. pSmular or and oblique The oblique fibres (fig. 145, .) are contmuous with cir^u^^r oi an^^^ deep layer of the cesophagus. On the left and right b^/^ f orifice they are so arranged as to form a kmdof spluncter (d and.) Fig. 145.* (Henle) ; but those on the left (e), the strongest, arch over the great end of the stomach, and spread out on the anterior and posterior surfaces, gradually disappearing on them. Fibrous coat. By remo-\'ing the muscular layer over a small space. The fibrous the fibrous coat will appear as a white shining stratum of areolar ^Â° ^ ^jn. ^ tissue. This coat gives strength to the stomach, and serves as a lied in which the larger vessels and nerves ramify before their dis- tribution to the mucous layer. If a small opening is made in this membrane, the mucous coat will project through it, supposing the stomach to be distended with air. The mucous coat will come into view on cutting open the stomach. Mucous but the appearances now described can be recognised only in a ' recent stomach. This coat is a softish layer, of a pale rose colour soon after death feel, in the healthy condition. In the empty state of the stomach the colour, membrane is less vascular than dming digestion ; and in infancy the natural redness is greater than in childhood or old age. When folds, the stomach is contracted the membrane is thrown into numerous wavy ridges or rugftc, which become longitudinal along the great curve, towards tlie pylorus. * Diagram representing the arrangement of the muscular fibres of the stomach.

Oblique fibres more numerous, on the right of the cardiac orifice, and covering the great end of the stomach.

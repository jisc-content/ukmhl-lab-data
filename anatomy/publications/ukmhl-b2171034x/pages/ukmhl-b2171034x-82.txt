DISSECTION OF THE NECK. 66 of lympha- tic (.luut: Only tlie origin and first part of the arterial branches can be now seen ; then- termination is met with in other stages of this dissec- tion, or in the dissection of other parts of the body. Next the student should seek the small right lymphatic duct that opens into the subclavian vein near the junction of this with Fig. 16.* of brachial ple.ms; the jugular. A notice of it will be given with the lymphatics of the thorax (p. 366). The outer part of the subclavian artery having been already prepared, let the dissector remove more completely the fibrous tissue from the nerves of the brachial plexus. From the plexus trace the small branch to the subclavius muscle ; and the branches to the rhomboid and serratus muscles, wloich pierce the middle scalenus. * A view of t'fie common carotid and subcla^^an ai-teries (Quain's "Ar- teries"). 1. Anterior scalenus, with the phrenic nerve on it. 2. Middle scalenus. 3. Levator anguli scapulse. 4. Omohyoideus. 5. Rectus capitis anticus major. 6. Common carotid ai-tery. 7. Subclavian vein. 8. Sub- clavian artery. 9. Digastric muscle. 10. P.arotid gland. 11. Submaxillary gland. 12. Thyroid body. 13. Trapezius muscle, reflected.

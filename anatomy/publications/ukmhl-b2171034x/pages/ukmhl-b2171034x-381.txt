365 THORACIC DUCT AND LYMPHATICS. The exte,-nal layer is formed of parallel longitudina fibres, which extemai._ form an entu-e covering, and end below on the stomach, ihe tbres ^^^^ begin opposite the cricoid cartilage (p. 132) ; and at intervals vary- ing from half an inch to an incii and a half, they are connected with tendinous points (^V To of an inch long) Uke the fibres of the rectus abdominis muscle. The internal layer of circular fibres is continuous above with the '^^^^^^^^ fibres of the pharynx ; they are more oblique at the middle than at fibres, either end of the CESophagus. The fibrous layer is situate between the muscular and mucous Fibrous coats, and attaches the one to the other loosely. _ _ The mucous coat will be seen on cuttmg open the tube : it is Mmous reddish in colour above but pale below, and is very loosely con- • nected with the muscular coat, so that it is thrown into longitudinal folds when the ojsophagus is contracted. Lining the interior is a thick layer of scaly epithelium ; and the surface is studded with ^P^*^^^^™ minute papillte. Some compoimd glands (oesophageal) are scattered along the tube : Some^ at the lower end of the gullet they are most numerous, and form a ^ ^° ^' ling (cardiac) close to the stomach. Lymphatics of the THORiVX. In the thorax are lymphatic vessels Lympiiatics of the wall and the viscera, which enter collections of glands, and "homx. end in one or other of the lymphatic ducts. Besides these, the large thoracic duct traverses the thorax in its course from the abdomen to the neck. Lymphatic glands. Along the course of the internal mammary Sternal artery lies a chain of sternal or mediastinal glands, which receive ° lymphatics fi'om the fi'ont of the chest, the thymus body, the peri- cardium, and the upper surfaces of the diaphragm and liver. On each side of the spine, near the heads of the ribs, as well as Intercostal, between the intercostal muscles, is placed a group of intercostal glands for the reception of the lymphatics of the posterior wall of the thorax. Numerous bronchial glands are situate at the diAasion and along Bronclual the side of the trachea, through which the lymphatics of the lung pass ; and beneath the arch of the aorta are a few cardiac glands, and cardiac, to which the lymphatics of the heart are directed. Along the side of the aorta and oesophagus is a chain of oisopha- CEsophageal. geal glands, which are joined by the lymphatics of the oesophagus, and communicate with those of the lungs. Tlie thoracic duct (fig. 106, ') is the main channel by which the Thoracic lymphatic and lacteal fluid of the lower half of the body, and of ^^^^ the left side of the upper half of the body, is conveyed into the blood. The duct begins in the abdomen in an enlargement (chyli begins in receptaculum, p. 540), and ends in the left subclavian vein of the ^^l^^Ci neck. It is about eighteen inches in length, and is contained in ends in the thorax, except at its origin and termination. It has the under- mentioned connections :— Entering the cavity on the right of the aorta and through the Connec- same opening, the duct ascends on the right side of that vessel

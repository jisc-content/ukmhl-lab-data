99 SUBLINGUAL GLAND. The iiYPO-GLOSSAL Or NINTH NERVE (fig. 23,") in the Bubmaxillary Ninth region lies on the hyo-glossus muscle, being concealed by the be- mylo-hyoideus: but at the inner border of the hyo-glossus it 5='""^^'^^^^ enters the fibres of the genio-hyo-glossus, and is continued along the middle line of the tongue to the tip. Branches. On the hyo-glossus the ninth nerve furnishes branches ^ J^Jj^""^''^" to the muscles of the submaxillary region, except the mylo-hyoid muscles and the digastric, \'va., to the hyo-glossus, stylo-glossus, gem'o- hyoideus, and genio-hyo-glossus. Further, some offsets communi- cate with the gustatory nerve on the hyo-glossus. Along the ^ddle of the tongue the nerve sends upwards long ^^^^^ filaments which supply the lingual structure, and communicate vnih. the giistatoiy nerve. The (jlosso-pliaryngeal cranial nei-ve (fig. 23, ••), crossing between Glosso- the two carotid arteries, com-ses over the stylo-pharyngeus and nlvll^^'^^^ the middle constrictor of the pharynx, and ends under the hyo- glossus in branches for the tongue. See Dissection of the Tongue. The duct of the siihnaxilla'fiy gland (fig. 23, AVharton's duct, AViiarton's issues from the deep part of the glandular mass turning round the '^^'^^ border of the mylo-hyoid muscle. It is about two inches in length, and is du-ected upwards on the hyo-glossus muscle, and beneath the gustatory nerve, to open on the side of the frasnum lingute in opens by the centre of an emmence : its opening in the mouth will be seen iJjfJJ™^ if a bristle be passed along it. The duct has a thin wall, and consists externally of a fibrous layer with much elastic tissue and a few pale muscular fibres ; and internally of a mucous lining Avith flattened epitheUum. The deep part of the submaxillaiy gland extends along the Sublingual side of the duct, reaching, in some instances, the sublingual gland, fjeueath The sublingual glaml (fig. 23, ^) is somewhat of the shape of an tongue, almond, and the longest measurement, which is about one inch and a half, is directed backwards. It is situate beneath the tip of the tongue, in contact with the inner surface of the lower jaw, and close to the symphysis. Separated from the cavity of the mouth by the mucous membrane, the gland is prolonged across the upper border of the genio-hyo-glossus muscle, so as to touch the one of the opposite side. The sublingual is an aggregation of small glandular masses. Structure, each being provided with a separate duct (Henle). The ducts pucts open (ductus Eiviniani) are from ten to eighteen in number. Some of '"outii. them open beneath the tongue along a crescent-shaped fold of the mucous membrane, and others join the Whartonian duct ; one or more form a larger tube, which either joins that duct or opens near it.

748 DISSECTION OF THE EAR. I Tympiuiic uerve supplies ineiiibrmic and otlicr branches, viz.: upwards, unite with the largo superficial petrosal, and the facial nerve. The connections of the chorda tympani nerve can be seen on the preparation used for tlie muscles. The tympanic branch of the glosso-pharyngeal nerve (fig 241 ) nerve of Jacobson (p. 109) enters a special aperture in the temporal bone, to reach the inner wall of the tympanum. In this cavity the nerve supplies filaments to the lining membrane and the fenestra Fig. 241.* One to the sympa- thetic. Another to petrosal nerve. And a third to otic ganglion : rotunda; and it terminates in the thi-ee undermentioned branches, which are contained in grooves on the promontory, and connect this nerve with others.f Branches. One branch is arched forwards and downwards, and enters the carotid canal to communicate with the sympathetic (*) on the arteiy (p. 115). A second (^) is directed upwards to join the large superficial petrosal ner^^e in the hiatus Fallopli (p. 143). And the third (■*) has the foUoAving course :—It ascends in front of the fenestra ovalis, and near the gangliform enlargement on the * Jacobson's neiTe in the tympanum (Breschet).—a. Carotid artery, b. Tensor tympani muscle. c. Inferior maxillary trunk of the fifth nerve. d. Otic ganglion, Nerves : 1. Petrous ganglion of the glosso-pharyngeal. 2. Nerve of Jacobson. 3. Sympathetic on the carotid. 4. Small superficial petrosal nerve. 5. Offset to join large petrosal nerve. 6. Branch to Eustachian tube. 7. Facial nerve ; 8. chorda tympani branch. 9. Nerve of the otic ganglion to the tensor tympani muscle. + Instead of viewing these filaments as offsets of the nerve of Jacobson, they may be sujiposed to come from the other nerves : according to this view the tympanic 'plcxus would be derived from several sources.

VESSELS AXD NERVES OF TYMPANUM. 747 that of the pharynx through the Eustachian tube, and is prolonged into the mastoid cells thi-ough the apertures leading into them. It assists to form part of the membrana tympani, and of the Arran^gc- secondary membrane in the fenestra rotunda ; it is reflected also cavity, over the chain of bones, the muscles, ligaments, and chorda tympani nerve. In the tympanum the membrane is thin, not very ^".^^^^^j^g vascular, and secretes a w^atery fluid ; but in the lower end of the " Eustachian tube it is thick and more vascular, is provided with numerous glands, and its epithehum is laminated. Its surface is covered with a columnar ciliated epithelium, but on Epithelium, the membrana tympani and the ossicula it is laminar and unciliated. Bloodvessels. The arteries of the tympanum are furnished fi-om ^^^^^^^^^^ the following branches of the external carotid, viz., internal maxil- carotids, lary, posterior auricular, ascending pharjoigeal; and some offsets come fi-om the internal carotid in the temporal bone. The veins join Veins, the large meningeal and pharyngeal branches. The internal maxillary artery supplies an inferior tympanic branch (fig. 238, d, p. 88), which enters the cavity through the Glase- lary, rian fissure, and distributes a branch to the membrane of the tympanum. The stylo-mastoid branch of the posterior auricular artery (p. 80), jjosterior; entering the lower end of the aqueduct of Fallopius, gives twigs to the back of the cavity, and the mastoid cells. One of this set, superior tympanic (fig. 238, e), anastomoses with the tympanic branch of the internal maxillary artery, and forms a circle around the membrana tympani, from which offsets are directed inwards. Other branches fi'om the ascending pharyngeal, or fi-om the in- inferior; ferior palatine artery, enter the fore part of the space by the P^l^t"^^- Eustachian tube. Nerves. The lining membrane of the tympanum is supplied from Nei-ves from the plexus (tympanic) between Jacobson's and the sympathetic ^^^^^^ nerve : but the muscles derive their nerves from other sources. Crossing the cavity is the. chorda tympani branch of the facial nerve. Dissection (fig. 241). The preparation of the tympanic plexus will Dissection require a separate fresh temporal bone, which has been softened in ^uj'nwves; diluted hydrochloric acid, and in which the nerves have been hardened afterwards in spirit. The origin of Jacobson's nerve fi'om the glosso-pharyngeal is firet to be sought close to the skull ; and the fine auricular branch of the pneumo-gastric may be looked for at the same time (p. Ill), outside Supposing the nerve to be found, the student should place the cayity,'"'' scalpel on the outer side of the Eustachian tube, and carry it back- wards through the vaginal and styloid processes of the temporal bone, so as to take away the outer part of the tympanum, but without opening the lower end of the aqueduct of Fallopius. After the tympanum has been laid open, Jacobson's nerve is to and inside be followed in its canal; and the branches in the grooves on the '^"^'^y- surface of the promontory are to be pursued :â€”one of tliese arch- ing forwards joins in the carotid plexus ; and two others directed

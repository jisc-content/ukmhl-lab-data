424 DISSECTION OF THE PERINiETJM. Superficial The suhcv taneous fatty layer or the superficial fascia of the anterior fascia: jj^if ^^^^ pcnna^um is continuous with that of the adjoining regions ; and its depth, and tlie quantity of fat in it, will vary with the condition of the body. It resembles the corresponding stratum variei'^'"''' t^''^ '1"^^ ^^PPer part of the tliigh, in consisting of two different portions. One, a subcutaneous fatty part, continuous with that of the rest of the body, which loses its fat towai-ds the scrotum, and possesses there involuntary muscular fibres. The other deeper, but more membranous part, is of Umited extent, varies. Superllcial and Fig. 130.* latter forms a deep part: and is connected with the firm subjacent structures. Externally it is fixed to the pubic arch of the hip-bone, outside the line of the crus penis and its muscle, extending as low as the ischial tuberositj^. Posteriorly the stratum bends down to join the triangular ligament of the urethi-a; but in front it is unattached, and is continued to the scrotum and penis. By means of similar connections of the tafront^^^" membrane on both sides, a space is enclosed over the anterior half this divided perinasum. From its -under surface a septum dips do^vn- liy a septum, wards in the middle line, and divides posteriorly the subjacent space into two ; but anteriorly this partition is less perfect, or may disappear. * Superficial dissection of tlie anterior half of the perinoeum (Illustrations of Dissections).

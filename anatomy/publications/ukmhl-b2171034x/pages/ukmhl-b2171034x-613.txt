597 SACRO-SCIATIC LIGAMENTS. extensible piece of cartilage interposed between them. In some instances, and especially during pregnancy, tliere is a greater Bometimes degree of motion perceptible. Two sacro-sciatic ligaments pass from the side of the sacrum and S^c'jo-J'cifÂ« coccyx to the hinder border of the os innominatum, across the space two;' Fig. 187.* FiK. 188.t between those bones at the back of the pelvis : they are named lai'ge and small. The large ligament (fig. 188, o) reaches from the back of the Large, liip bone, and the side of the sacrum and coccyx to the ischial tube- rosity. As this may have been cut in the examination of the gluteal region, no fiu-ther notice is given here ; but if it remains entire, see p. GoO for its description. The small ligament (fig. 188, I) is attached internally by a wide Small; piece to the border of the sacrum and coccyx, where it is united with the origin of the preceding band. The fibres are directed attacluuents outwards, and arc inserted as a naiTOw band mto the ischial spine of the hip bone. Its pelvic surface is covered by the coccygeus and con- muscle ; and by the opposite surface it is in contact with the great "^ctious. sacro-sciatic ligament. Above it is the large sacro-sciatic foramen ; and below it is the small foramen of the same name, Avhich is bounded by the two ligaments. By their position these ligaments convert into two foramina Aiiertnros (sacro-sciatic), the large sacro-sciatic excavation in the dried bones : them!' the openings, and tlie things they give passage to, are described with the Buttock, p. G50. * This figure shows the in-egular piece of cartilage {a) in the sacro-iliac articulation. t Sacro-sciatic ligaments, a. Large or posterior ligament, h. Small or anterior ligament.

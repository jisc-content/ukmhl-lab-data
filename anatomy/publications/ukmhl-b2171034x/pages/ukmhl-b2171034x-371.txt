355 VAGUS NERVE AND BRiiNCHES. and 18 directed obliquely backwards, by the side of the trachea and between this tube and the oesophagus, to the postenor aspect of the root of the lung, where it gives rise to the postenor V^^o^^^ plexus. From the plexus two large offsets are continueci , back of back of the gullet, and unite below into one trunk, which reaches ^sopiuigus. the posterior surface of the stomach. ^^^^ ^^^^^^ The left nerve appears in the thorax on the outer side ol tne leit above root common carotid artery, and courses over the arch of the aorta, and of lung, beneath the root of the Imig, forming there a larger plexus than . on the right side. From the pulmonic plexus one or two branches a^^aon^ pass to the front of the oesophagus, and join Avith offsets ot the oesophagus, right nerve in a plexus ; but these pieces are collected finally mto one trunk, which is continued on the fi-ont of the gullet to the anterior part of the stomach. The branches of the pneumo-gastric nerve in the thorax are the following:— a. The recurrent or inferior laryngeal nerve, arismg on the right ^^^^ side on a level with the subclavian artery, and on the left at the lower border of the arch of the aorta, bends backwards to the trachea, along which it ascends to the larynx. On each side this branch is freely connected with the cervical cardiac branches of the sympathetic nerve, especially on the left side beneath the arch of the aorta. b. Cardiac branches (thoracic). Besides the cardiac branches fur- ^^^^^'g,. nished by the vagus in the neck, other offsets pass in fi'ont of the trachea to the cardiac plexus. On the right side they come from the trunlc of the vagus and the recurrent branch, but they are sup- phed by the recurrent nerve alone on the left side. The termination of the lower cervical cardiac branch of each p'^^^^^^^Jg" vagus ners'^e (p. Ill) may be now seen. The branch of the right brauch. lies by the side of the innominate arteiy, and joins a cardiac nerve of the sympathetic of the same side ; and the branch of the left vagus crosses over the arch of the aorta, to end in the superficial cardiac plexus (p. 337). c. Pulmonary branches. There are two sets of nei^ves for the Pulmonary lung, one on the anterior and the other on the posterior aspect of ^^'^"'^^'^^ ■ the root. The anterior branches are two or thi-ee in number, and small in ^^^'^gjlj^,. size, and communicate with filaments of the sjanpathetic on the pulmonary artery : these nerves are best seen on the left side. The posterior branches are the largest and much the most nume- '"^1°^.;^,, rous. Forming a plexif orm arrangement (posterior pulmonary form a plexus) behind the root of the lung by the flattening and splitting l'^^^^^- of the trunk of the nerve, they are joined by filaments from the third and fourth ganglia of the knotted cord of the sympathetic, and arc conveyed into the lung on the divisions of the air tube., d. (Esophageal branches are furnished to the gullet, but m greatest Tf.ai,ciief'^''^^ abundance in the lower half. Below the root of the lung the form a branches of the pneumo-gastric nerves surround the oesophagus with l'^^^"^^- a network (plexus gulce). A A 2

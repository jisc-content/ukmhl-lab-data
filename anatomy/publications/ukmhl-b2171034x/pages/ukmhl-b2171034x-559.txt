543 LUMBAR ARTERIES AND VEINS. A branch to the femoral arienj, whose place of origin varies much, toft^moral is distributed around the upper part of that vessel. , * /. The obturator nerve (n) appertains to the adductor muscles of f^'^^^^"^ the thigh (p. 633). Derived from the third and fourth nerves m aixlomen; the plexus, it is directed beneath the psoas to the inner border ; escaped from beneath the muscle the nerve crosses the pelvis below the external iliac, but above the obturator vessels, and enters the emi«_intl.e thigh through the aperture at the top of the tiiyroid foramen. Occasionally the obturator gives origin to the following branch:— The accessor!/ obturator nerve (/) arises from the trunk of the |j*^f,^^f'''°''i' •obturator, or from the third and fourth nerves of the plexus. Its ^^^^^^^y^^^ course is along the inner border of the psoas beneath the investing iiip joint fascia, and over the hip bone to the thigh, where it ends by joining the obturator ners^e, and supplying the hip jomt. Gangliated cord of the sympathetic. The lumbar part of the ^l^f^^g^^ :gangliated cord of the sjanpathetic in the abdomen is placed on the in tlie side of the spinal column (fig. 170) ; it lies along the inner border ^^'^""^^"j. of the psoas muscle, nearer the fi-ont of the vertebraj than in the iil'tuorax; thorax, and is somewhat concealed on the right side by the vena •cava. The cord possesses four or five oblong ganglia opposite the jias fojjr^^r _ •bodies of the vertebrre, which supply connecting and visceral branches. Connecting branches. From each ganglion two small branches are hranclies to ■directed backwards along the centre of the body of the vertebra, uerves"^^ ■with the lumbar artery ; these unite with one or two spinal nerves near the interv^ertebral foramen. The connecting branches are long in the lumbar region in consequence of the gangliated cord being raised by the psoas muscle nearer the fi-ont of the vertebra3. Branches of distribution. Most of the internal branches throw supplies themselves into the aortic and hypogastric plexuses, and so reach ^ '•'■oera. the viscera indirectl3\ Some filaments enter the vertebrae and their •connecting ligaments. Last dorsal nerve (fig. 170 e). The anterior primary branch of the Last dorsal last dorsal resembles the intercostal ner^-es in its distribution, but differs from them in not being contained in an intercostal space. Lying below the last rib, the nerve is directed outwards across the upper part of the quadratus lumborum, and beneath the fascia cover- ing that muscle, as far as the aponeurosis of the transversalis ab- course in dominis (fascia lumborum) ; here it enters the wall of the abdomen, abaomeu,'^ and ends in an abdominal and a cutaneous branch (p. 450). The lowest intercostal artery accompanies it. Near the spine it furnishes a small branch to the quadratus muscle • I'mucIi to and it may communicate by means of this with the first lumbar nerve. The LUMiiAii ARTERIES of the aorta (p. 533), are furnished to the Lumbar Back, the spinal canal, and the wall of the abdomen : they resemble nveiumim- the aortic intercostals in their course and distribution. Commonly ^^'^^^ four in number on each side, they arise opposite the centre of the " lumbar vertebra), and the vessels of opposite sides are sometimes .joined in a common trunk ; they then pass backwards beneath the course:

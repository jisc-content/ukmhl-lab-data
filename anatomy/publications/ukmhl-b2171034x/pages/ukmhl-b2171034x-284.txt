It bends the elbow-joint, and acts powerfully in supi- nating the radius. When the body is hanging by the hands it will apply the scapula firmly to the humerus, and will assist in raising the trunk. With the arm hanging and the radius fixed, the long head will assist the abductors in removing the limb from the thorax; and after the limb is abducted, the short head will aid iii restoring it to the pendent position; The CORACO-BRACHIALIS (fig. 73, ") is roundish in form, and is named from its attachments. Its oriqin is fleshy from the tip of the coracoid process, and from the tendinous short head of the biceps. Its fibres become tendinous, and are inserted, below the level of the deltoid muscle, into the ridge on the inner side of the humerus: from the insertion an aponeurotic slip is continued upwards to the head of the humerus, and is joined by fleshy fibres. Part of the muscle is beneath the pectoralis major (fig. 78), and forms a prominence in the axilla ; but the rest is superficial, except at the insertion where it is covered by the brachial vessels and the median nerve. The coraco-brachialis conceals the subscapular muscle, the anterior circumflex vessels, and the tendons of the latissimus and teres. Along the inner border are the large artery and ner\'^es of the limb. Perforating it is the inusculo-cutaneous nerve. Action. The hanging limb is abducted to the thorax by this muscle ; and the action is gi-eater in proportion as the humerus is removed from the trunk. The humerus being fixed, the muscle will bring down the scapula, and assist in keeping the articular surfaces of the shoulder joint in apposition. The BRACHIAL ARTERY (fig. 77, ^) is a continuation of the axillarj' trunk, and supplies vessels to the upper limb. It begins at the lower border of the teres major muscle, and terminates rather below the bend of the elbow, or "opposite the neck of the i-adius" (Quain), in two branches—radial and ulnar, for the forearm. In the upper part of its course, the vessel is internal to the humerus, but afterwards in front of that bone ; and its situation is indicated by the surface depression along the inner border of the biceps and coraco-brachialis muscles. In all its extent the brachial artery is superficial, being covered by the integuments and the deep fascia ; but at the bend of the elbow it becomes deeper, and is crossed by the prolongation from the tendon of the biceps. Posteriorly the artery has the following muscular connections (fig. 78) :—Whilst it is inside the humerus it is placed over the long liead of the triceps, f, for two inches, but separated partly by the musculo-spiral nerve and profunda vessels; and over the inner head, G, of the same muscle for about an inch and a half. But when the vessel turns to the front of the bone, it lies on the insertion of the coraco-brachialis, c, and on the brachialis anticus, ii. To the outer side are laid the coraco-brachialis and biceps muscles, c, and B, the latter overlapping it. Veins. Venaj comites lie on the sides of the artery (fig. 78, d),

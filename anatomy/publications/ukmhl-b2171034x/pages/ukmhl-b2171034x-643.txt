In it the patella is situate, some few scattered aponeu- rotic fibres passing over the cutaneous surface, but none being con- tinued over the articular surface of the bone. (See Ligament of the Patella, p. 700.) From the lower part of the muscle a superficial aponeurotic ex- expansion pansion is derived: this prolongation, which is strongest on the inner side, is united with the fascia lata and the other tendinous offsets to form a capsule in front of the joint, and is fixed below to the heads of the tibia and fibula. Suhcrurem muscle. Beneath the strong fibres of the vastus, near SmaU sub- the laiee joint, is a thin layer of pale fibres, wliich is but a part of muscle; the mner vastus, separated from the rest by areolar tissue. Attached ends on the to the femur in the lower fourth, and often by an outer and imier slip, syno™^ sac. it ends in aponeurotic fibres on the synovial sac of the loiee joint. Action. All three heads of the triceps extend the knee joint when Usejrith^^^ the tibia is moveable ; and the rectus can flex the hip joint over abie^""'^^' which it passes. The fleshy bellies are strong enough to break the patella transversely over the end of the femur, or to rupture some- times the common tendon. When the tibia is fixed the vasti -will bring forwards the femur, ^^^^f^^'* and straighten the knee, as in walking or standing ; and the rectus will prop the pehds on the femm-, or assist in moving it forwards hi stooping.

The inner partition is very thin along the side of the vastus the inner is internus ; and its place is supplied by the strong tendon of the "^'^^•^"^ct. adductor magnus between the inner condyle and the linea aspera : the internal articular vessels are transmitted thi-ough it to the front of the knee joint. The EXTERNAL CIRCUMFLEX ARTERY (fig. 196, ^) is the chief vessel Extei-nal for the supply of the muscles of the front of the thigh. It arises artery^''^ from the outer side of the profunda (deep femoral) artery, but often from the femoral trunk. It is du-ected outwards through the divisions of the anterior crural nerve, and beneath the sartorius and rectus muscles to the outer part of the thigh, where it ends in branches. Offsets are given from it to the rectus and sartorius ; its bwuchea s s 2 ^'"'^

97 GUSTATORY NERVE. Tlie lingual artery (fig. 17,/), arises from the external carotid Lingual between the superior thyroid and facial branches. At first it is ^^^^^^ directed inwards above the os hyoides, and then upwards beneath tj.e tongue the hyo-glossus to the under part of the tongue (fig. 23) ; it ends J-^*'';''^"- at the anterior border of that muscle in the sublingual and ramne branches. Near the hyo-glossus the artery is crossed by tlie ninth nerve, and by the digastric and stylo-hyoid muscles. Beneath the hyo-glossus, the vessel rests on the middle constrictor and genio- hyo-glossus muscles, and is below the level of the glosso-pharyngeal nerve. Its branches are these :— a. A small hijoid branch is distributed on the upper border of the its tonches OS hyoides, supplying the muscles ; it anastomoses with its fellow j^^^.^ of the opposite side, and with the hyoid branch of the superior bone; thyroid artery of the same side. b. A branch to the dorsum of the tongue arises beneath the hyo- ^^^^^ . glossus muscle, and ascends to supply the substance of the tongue ^ ' and the tonsil. The fibres of the hyo-glossus must be divided to sec it. c. The sublingual branch springs fi-om the final division of the to tiie sub- arteiy at the edge of the hyo-glossus, and is directed outwards to giami; the gland of the same name. Some offsets supply the gums and the contiguous muscles, and one continues behind the incisor teeth to join a similar artery from the other side. d. The ranine branch (9) is the terminal part of the lingual to the sub- StrclTlCG of artery, and extends forwards along the outer side of the genio-hyo- tongue, glossus to the tip of the tongue where it ends. Muscular offsets are furnished to the substance of the tongue of the same side. This artery Ues along the fi-£enum lingua, but is embedded in the muscular fibres. The lingual vein commences on both the upper and under surfaces Lingual of the tongue. It lies with its companion artery, and ends in the internal jugular vein. The GUSTATORY or LINGUAL NERVE (fig. 23, ') has been followed I'ingual I161'V6 in the pterygo-maxillary region to its passage between the ramus of the lower jaw and the internal pterygoid muscle (p. 92). In this region the nerve is inclined forwards to the side of the tongue, ^'/'"Q^j'^jfg^ across the mucous membrane of the mouth and the origin of the superior constrictor muscle, and above the deep part of the sub- maxillary gland. Lastly, it is directed across the Whartonian duct, and along the side of the tongue to the apex.

ARTERIES OF THE BRAIX. 183 between the halves of the large brain : and as it is about to enter, it is united to its fellow by a short thick branch,-the antovor c— communicating (■>). Then passing into the fissure, it bends round ^^ery; the anterior part of the corpus callosum, so as to be placed on the upper aspect in the natural position of the brain, and is continued backwards, distributing offsets nearly to the posterior extremity of tli6 liGniispliGrs It gives off numerous branches, and some of them supply the base its offsets of the cerebrum, thus :— Neai- the commencement it furnishes small branches to the brain to base of (anterior perforated spot) contiguous to the inner end of the fissure of Sylvius : and it distributes some offsets to the under part of the frontal lobe. ., b. The micMle cerebral artery C) is the largest branch of the carotid, ;^',ebrai and ramifies over the outer side of the hemisphere. Entering the aitery fissure of Sylvius, the artery divides into many large pieces, which issue at the outer end of that groove and, spreading over the external surface of the hemisphere, inosculate with the other two ^^^gVpartof . cerebral arteries at the fi-ont, the back, and the upper part of the hemisphere: brain.

Sylvius, and enter the cerebral substance through the substantia perforata antica. c. The posterior communicatinfj artery (") is a small tAvig, which ^"yj^^ji. is du-ected backwards parallel to, and on the inner side of the third eating, nerve, to join the posterior cerebral artery (of the basilar) near the pons. d. The choroid artei-y (anterior) (^) is small in size, and arises either from the trunk of the carotid, or from the middle cerebral artery : it passes backwards on the outer side of the precedmg, and finds its way between the hemisphere and the crus cerebri to the choroid plexus of the lateral ventricle. Circle of Willis. The arteries at the under part of the brain are Circle of . . Willis ■ united freely both on then- own side and across the middle line m ' an arterial anastomosis,—the circle of Willis. On each side this vessels that circle is fonned by the trunk of the internal carotid giving for- wards the anterior cerebral, and backwards the posterior communi- cating artery. In front it is constructed by the converging anterior cerebral, and the anterior communicating artery. And beliind is the bifurcation of the basilar trunk into the posterior cerebrals. In the area of the circle lie several bodies corresponding with the floor of the third ventricle. Tlie complete inosculation between the cranial vessels in the f^oscufation circle of Willis allows at all times a free cnculation of blood through between the brain, even though a large vessel on one side of the neck should be obstructed. The VEINS of the brain enter the sinuses of the dm-a mater, instead Veins of the of uniting into trunks as companions to the arteries. Two sets of veins belong to the cerebrum, viz. superficial or ex- Two sets of temal, and deep or internal. > ccrebmm,

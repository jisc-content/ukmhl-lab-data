571 ANATOMY OF YESICULA SEMIXALIS. Bloodvessels. The arteries are rather small, and are furnished by Arteries, the inferior vesical and middle hasmorrhoidal (p. 5G3). The veins form a plexus around the gland, which comnnuiicatcs in front with Veins form the dorsal vein of the penis, and beliind Avith the venous plexus at l'''^'""'*- the base of the bladder. In old men this vascular intercommuni- cation gives rise to considerable haaraoiThage in the operation of lithotomy. The nerves are supplied bj' the hypogastric plexus. The lymphatics Nen-es. of this body and of the vesicula3 seminales are received into the Ljnui)Iiatics. glands by the side of the internal iliac artery. VESicuL.'ii Seminalks (fig. 17G, e). These vesicles are two mem- Seminal branous sacs, which secrete a fluid to mix with the semen. They '• Fig. 176.* are placed on the under surface of the bladder behind the prostate, aefmition and diverge fi-om one another so as to limit laterally a triangular situation' space in that situation : their form and connections have been already described (p. 054). Though sacculated and bulged beliind, sacculated the vesicula becomes straight and narrowed in front (duct) ; and at the base of the prostate it blends with the vas deferens to form the common seminal or ejaculatory duct (r/). The vesicula seminalis consists, like tl'ie epididymis, of a tube rorn,e,iora bent into a zigzag form, so as to produce lateral sacs or pouches '"'^^: * View of the under surface of the bladder with the vesiculie seminales and vasa deferentia (shghtly altered from Halier). a.

195 GRAY SUBSTANCE OF MEDULLA. Remains of gray matter of the spinal cord. At the lower end of fj^'^^^e^^,^* the medulla the central gray matter resembles that in the spinal of meduUa. cord (fig. 126), but it undergoes the following changes : ^—The posterior comu increases in bulk, and extends towards the side of Posterior the cord, where it appears on the surface, in front of the restiform body, as the gray tubercle of Rolando (tuberculo cinero, fig. 58, t). Higher in the medulla it becomes the chief nucleus of the sensory root of the fifth nei've. The piece of the gray commissure behind the central canal of the gray com- • missupc * cord joins, above, the nucleus of the vagus nerve, and contributes to the auditory nucleus : and the piece in front of the canal is laid Fig. 58.+ bare in the floor of the fourth ventricle by the inclination outwards of the restiform bodies ; above it enters the fasciculi teretes (p. 229). Special deposits of gray matter. Other gi-ay deposits exist in the special medulla, both in fi-ont and behind :—^those behind are near the floor deposits of of the fom'th ventricle, and serve as nuclei of origin for certain ^^^'^''^^ nei-ves ; whilst those in fi'ont are interspersed amongst the fibres of the lateral columns of the cord. Nuclei at the hack of the medidla. A nucleus for the hypoglossal Nucleus of nerve is deposited in fi'ont of the central canal, and extends upwards '^'"'^^ into the floor of the fourth ventricle close to the median sulcus (fig. 58, 0). The nucleus of the accessory part of the spinal accessory nerve is Nucleus of placed opposite that of the hypoglossal, but behind the central canal mc&s- ' sory * The description of the arrangement of the gi-ay matter in the medulla oblongata is a summary of the facts contained in Mr. Clarke's Paper in the " Transactions of the Royal Society for 1858." t Transverse section of the medulla oblongata above the middle of the olivary body (Clarke), a.

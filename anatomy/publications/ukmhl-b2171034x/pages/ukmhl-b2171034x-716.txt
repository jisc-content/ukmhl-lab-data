700 DISSECTION OF THE LEG. Anterior ligament, tendon of tlio extensor. Open tlie kneo-joiut of the articulation; and the tendon of the nerves to the interior popliteus pierces it. The anterior ligament (ligamentum patellaj, fig. 215, part of the tendon of insertion of the extensor muscle of the knee (p. 626) is two inches long. Superiorly it is attached to the lower point ot the patella, and to the depression on the inner surface of the apex ; and infenorly it is inserted into the tubercle of the head of the tibia, and into an inch of the bone below it. An expansion of the triceps extensor covers it; and a bursa intervenes between it and the top of the tubercle of the tibia. Dissection (fig. 216). To see the reflections of the synovial mem- brane raise the knee on blocks, and open the joint by an incision on each side, above the patella. When the anterior portion of the capsule with the patella is thrown down, a fold (mucous ligament) will be seen extending from the intercondyloid fossa of the femur to a mass of fat below the patella. On each side of the knee-pan is a similar fold (alar ligament) over some fat. and dissect The limb may be laid flat on the table, and some of the posterior menfe ligament may be removed, to show the pouches of the synovial membrane which project behind over the condyles of the femur ; but the limb is to be replaced in the former position before the parts are learnt. Synovial The synovial memhrane (fig. 216) lines the interior of the capsule, membrane jg continued to the articular ends of the bones. It inA^ests the interarticulai- cartilages after the manner of serous membranes, and * The capsule of the knee-joint cut across, and the patella thrown down, to show the named folds of the synovial sac. a. Mucous ligament, b. Internal, and c, externa] alar ligament.

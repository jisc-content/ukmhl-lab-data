The inner head is hxed by a narrow tendon to the anterior surface of the stcrnuia, first piece of the sternum ; and the outer head has a wide fleshy andciavi, attachment to the sternal third of the clavicle. From this origin the heads are directed upwards, the internal passing backwards, Fig. 15*. and the external alniost vertically, and are blended about the middle of the neck in a roundish belly.

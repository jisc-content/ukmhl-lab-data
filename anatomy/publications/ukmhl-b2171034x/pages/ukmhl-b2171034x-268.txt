252 DISSECTION OF THE UrPER LIMB. Inner layer deficient behinil; join.s inter- nal oblique below. Use of outer muscles; inner layer, laterally, in front. Both acting. Dissection of internal manunary vessels. Triangularis sterni is in the thorax and attached to the ribs. Connec- tions. Use. The internal intercostal muscle, attached to the inner border of the ribs bounding the intercostal space, begins in front at the ex- tremity of the ribs, and ceases behind near tlicir angles. Posteriorly they do not end at the same distance fi-om the spine, for the upper and lower approach nearer than the middle ; and, anteriorly, in the two lowest spaces, the muscular fibres are continuous with the internal obHque of the abdomen. One surface is covered by the external muscle and the intercostal vessels and nerve ; and the opposite surface is in contact with the pleura. Action. By the alternate action of the intercostal muscles the ribs ai'e moved in respiration. The external intercostals elevate the ribs and evert the lower edges, so as to enlarge the thorax in the antero-posterior and transverse directions : they come into play during inspiration. The intei-nal intercostals act in a different way at the side and fore part of the chest. Between the osseous parts of the ribs they depress and turn in those bones, diminishing the size of the thorax ; and they are brought into use in expiration. Between the rib-cartilages they raise the ribs, and become muscles of inspiration, like the outer layer. If both sets of muscles contract simultaneously the motion of the ribs will be arrested ; or if two or more ribs are broken near the spinal column, the muscles of the space or spaces injm-ed will be unable to move those bones. Dissection. To bring into \\ew the triangularis sterai muscle and the internal mammary vessels, the cartilages of the tnie ribs, except the first and seventh, are to be taken away with the Intervening muscles on the right side of the body but the two ribs mentioned are to be left untouched for the benefit of the dissectors of the abdomen and head and neck. Small arteries to each intercostal space and the surface of the thorax, and the intercostal nei-ves, are to be preserved. The surface of the triangularis stemi will be apparent when the loose tissue and fat are removed. The TRIANGULARIS STERNi (fig. 72, a) is a thin muscle beneath the costal cartilages. It arises internally from the side of the xiphoid cartilage, fi-om the side of the sternum as high as the tliird costal cartilage, and usually from the inner ends of the lower three true costal cartilages. Its fibres are directed outwards, the upper being most obhque, and are inserted by fleshy f ascicuH into the true ribs except the last two and the first, at the jnnction of the bone and cartilage ; and into an aponeurosis in the intercostal spaces. The muscle is covered by the ribs and the internal intercostals, and by the internal mammary vessels and the intercostal nerves. It lies on the pleura. Its lower fibres touch those of the transver- salis abdominis (fig. 72, â–  Action. The muscle assists in depressing the anterior ends of the * On the left side the vessels and the muscle may have been destroyed by the injection of the body.

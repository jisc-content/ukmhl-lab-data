177 STERNO-CLAVICULAR JOINT. joint. Sometimes there is an aperture in the centre of the fibro- ''t!^o synovial sacs are present in the articulation, one on each side Two^yj^^^_ of the fibro-cartilage. The sac in contact with the sternum is looser ^^anes. than that touching the clavicle. Movement. The inner end of the clavicle can be moved up and moHou down, and forwards and backwards, and the direction it takes is the opposite to that of the limb and the shoulder. Thus when the limb is depressed the sternal end of the clavicle is raised ; and if the arm is elevated, the inner end of that bone will be lowered. When the shoulder is forced back the collar bone moves forwai'ds at the sternum ; and the inner end of that bone Avill project back when the shoulder is impelled forwards. The extent of each move- ment is but limited, though those forwards and upwards are the freest ; and dislocation may ensue in any direction, except down- wards. * Ligaments of the inner end of the clavicle, and of the cartilage of the second rib. 1. Capsule. 2. Costo-clavicular ligament. 3. Interclavicular ligament. 4. Ligaments of the second rib with the sternum. 6. Inter- articular fibro-cartilage of second rib. 7. Interarticular fibro-cartilage of the clavicle. N

Excretory duct is bent on the testicle forming epididymis iianjed parts. Is but a single tube length and size. Wliere it is straight it is the vas deferens : this opens into the urctlira : become larger (J^tli of an incli) and straigliter in direction, and are named tnbuli recti or vasa recta : tiiey are about twenty in number, and piercing the fibrous mediastinum enter into tlie rete testis. Eete testis (fig. 1G7, e). In the mediastinum tlic seminal tubes have very tlnn walls, and are situate in the anterior part, in front of the bloodvessels; they communicate freely so as to form a net- work. Vasa efferentia (fig. 1G7,/). About twelve or twenty seminal tubes issue from the top of the rete, and leave the upper end of the testicle as the vasa efferentia : these are larger than the tubes with which they are continuous, and end in the common excretory duct. Though straight at first they soon become convoluted, and have been named coni vasculost. In the natural state they are about half an inch in length, but when unravelled they measure six inches • and they join the excretory duct at intei-vals of about three inches! They have a muscular coat of longitudinal and circular fibres ; and the epithelium of the mucous lining is columnar and cihated. The EXCRETORY DUCT receives the vasa efl:erentia from the upper part of the gland, and extends thence to the uretlu-a. Its first part, Avhich is in contact with the testis, is very fiexuous, and forms the epididymis : but the remainder is straight, and is named vas deferens. The epididymis (fig. 1G7, h) extends in the form of anarch along the outer side of the testis, from the upper to the lower end, and receives its name fi-om its situation. Opposite the upper part of the testicle it presents an enlarged portion or head, the globus major {(j) ; and at the lower end of that organ it becomes more pomted or tail-like—(jlohus minor (i), before ending in the vas deferens. The intervening narrow part of the epididymis is called the body (h). Its head is attached to the testis by the vasa eflrerentia; and its lower part is fixed to the tunica albuginea by fibrous tissue, and by the reflection of the tmiica vaginalis. The epididymis is formed of a single tube, bent in a zigzag way, whose coils are united into a solid mass b}'- fibrous tissue. After the removal of the serous membrane and some fibrous tissue this part of the tube may be uncoiled ; it will then measm-e twenty feet in length. The diameter of its canal is about ^th of an inch, though there is a shght diminution in size towards the globus minor, but it is increased finally in the vas deferens. The vas deferens (fig. 167, /j) begins opposite the lower end of the testis, at the termination of the globus minor of the epididymis. At first the excretory duct is slightly wavy, but afterwards it becomes for the most part a fiiTC round tube : near its termination it is enlarged again and sacculated, but this condition will be refeiTcd to with the ^dscera of the pelvis. In its course to the urethra it ascends on the inner side of the testicle, and along the bloodvessels of the spermatic cord with which it enters the internal abdominal yng ; it is then directed over the side of the bladder, and through the prostate to open into the

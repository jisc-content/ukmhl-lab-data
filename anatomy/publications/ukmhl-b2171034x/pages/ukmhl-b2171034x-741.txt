725 STRUCTURE OF CORNEA. its transparency is destroyed by disturbance of the position of the strata. The tissue when boiled gives chondrin. Between the corneal layers are flattened irregular spaces, which join freely with one another ; and these intei-vals are occupied by nucleated stellate cells, called corneal corpuscles. In the healthy condition bloodvessels do not penneate it, but cease in capillary loops at the circumference. Nerves ramify in it, after losing their opacity at the circumference : they are said to form a subepithelial plexus on the anterior surface, from which varicose fibrils are prolonged amongst the pieces of the epithelium. The membrane at the back of the cornea (fig. 226)—membrane of Demours—consists of a basement layer covered by epithelium. The basement layer, E (posterior elastic lamina. Bowman), may be peeled off after a cut has been made across the cornea. It is dense, hard and elastic, measuring -^oo^"^ 2^*^ ^ ^"^^ ™ t\rick.- ness ; it is veiy brittle, tearing readily when an attempt is made to separate it, and curls up when it is free, with the attached surface innermost. Though very elastic, the struc- ture is destitute of fibres. It is always transparent, and remains so after boiling, after the action of acids, and even after maceration. At the edge of the comea this lamina breaks up into processes (" pillars of the iris ") which blend with the outer margin of the ills, and with the sclerotic and choroid coats. A luminar epithelium, G, like that on serous membranes, clothes its fi-ee surface (fig. 226). The conjunctiva in front of the cornea (fig. 226) consists chiefly of epithehum cells, though there is a subjacent basement-like stratum.

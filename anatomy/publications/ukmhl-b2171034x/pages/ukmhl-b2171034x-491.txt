Each part of the colon has a separate meso-colon attaching it, thus there is an ascending, a transverse, a descending, and a sigmoid meso-colon. The caecum is fixed by a meso-cajcum, and the rectum by a meso-rectum. The meso-ccecum attaches the caput caecum coli to the right iliac meso- C86CUID. * fossa. Usually the peritoneum does not surround the gut so as to form a fold behind it, but in some bodies the serous membrane furnishes a suspensory process to this part of the intestine. By the ascending and the descending meso-colon the ascending and ^^^^"^^'^ the descending parts of the colon ai-e kept in place. In the folds, meso-colon'; as in that of the caecum, the peritoneum does not commonly surround the intestine, though it may meet behind the gut and form pro- cesses of some length. The upper end of the left colon has a distinct foldâ€”pleuro-colic, pleuro-colic fixing it to the wall of the abdomen. Attached by a wide end to ' the diaplu-agm opposite the eleventh or tenth rib, it passes trans- versely below the spleen, and forms the lower boundary of a hollow in which the spleen rests. The transverse meso-colon is a more perfect fold than either of the transverse others connected with the large intestine, and serves as a partition between the small intestine and the stomach, liver, and spleen. By one side it is fixed to the colon, and by the other to the abdominal wall below the pancreas. It encloses the vessels of the colon between its layers. The sigmoid meso-colon is a long process of the serous membrane, sigmoid and attaches the sigmoid flexure of the colon to the left iliac fossa.

For whilst smau'^tes- the jejunum and ileum are attached to the abdominal wall by one t^e- process (mesentery), the duodenum has special connections with the serous membrane.

And the last part, which crosses the aorta, is but slightly in contact with the serous membrane ; for it lies at first between the strata of the transverse meso-colon, and then beneath the superior mesenteric vessels.

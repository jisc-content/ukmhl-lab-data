This hernial tumbur is generally smaller than inguinal, â–  and does not extend into the scrotum in the male, or the labium in the female ; and if its neck can be traced below Poupart's liga- ment, it can be distinguished certainly from an inguinal hernia. Place of Seat of stricture and division of it. The strangulation of a femoral ^ hernia may be situate either outside or inside the neck of the sac. How to cut The external stricture may be found opposite the margin of the the external ga,p]ienous opening, or deeper in, opposite Poupart's hgament. It may be removed by cutting down on the neck of the tumoiu- at the inner side, and dividing the constricting band arching over the neck of the hernia in this situation, without opening the sac. and the The stricture inside the neck of the sac is occasioned by the tliick- structure. ening of the peritoneum. For its relief the neck of the sac is to be laid bai-e, as if there was an external stricture ; and if the intestine cannot be passed into the abdomen after division of all resisting- bands on the exterior of the neck, the sac of the peritoneum is to be opened ; and a director having been introduced through the con- striction, a cut is to be made horizontally inwards for the extent of one or two lines. The several vessels that may be wounded in at- tempting to relieve the deep stricture are enumerated at page 465. Scarpa's triangular space.

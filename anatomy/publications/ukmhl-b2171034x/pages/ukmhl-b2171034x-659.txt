The fibres con- verge to a tendon which is inserted into an impression across the and inserted outer surface of 'the great trochanter, extending from the tip ^^to^t^o; behind to the root m fi-ont. The superficial surface is concealed in part by the gluteus maxi- Connec- mus ; and the deep is in contact with the gluteus minimus, and the ' ' gluteal vessels and nerve. The anterior border lies over the gluteus minimus, and is in contact with the tensor of the fascia lata. The posterior is contiguous to the pyriformis, only the gluteal vessels intervening. A small bursa is interposed between the tendon of insertion and the trochanter. Action. The whole muscle abducts the hanging femur ; and the j?^*'^^'^ anterior fibres rotate in the limb. In walldng it is combined with hanging, the adductors in mo^ang forwards the femur. Both limbs resting on the ground the muscles assist in fixing the both limbs pelvis.

Detach and partly separated from the gluteus minimus beneath, the gluteal ^|jJs''t(f see vessels and nerve mil come into view. The two chief branches gluteal ves- of the artery,—one being near the iliac crest, and the other lower down,—are to be traced through the fleshy fibres as the reflection of the gluteus is proceeded with ; and the main piece of the nerve and nerve, is to be followed forwards to the tensor vaginjB femoris muscle. The branches of the artery and nerve to the gluteus medius will be cut in removing that muscle. The gluteal artery (fig. 198, a) is the lai-gest branch of the inter- Gluteal nal iliac (p. 663), and issues from the pelvis above the pyi-iformis ^^'^^'^'^ muscle. On the dorsum of the hip bone it ends in offsets which di^^ded into supply the gluteal muscles and the bone. Its named branches are superficial and deep :— The superficial branch supplies offsets to the integuments, and Superficial some deeper twigs over the sacrum ; it ends in the gluteus maxi- mus, which it penetrates on the under surface. The deep branch (fig. 199, a) is the continuation of the arteiy. Deep and subdivides into two pieces which run between the two smaller = glutei. One (6, superior) courses along the origin of the gluteus minimus (supplying mostly the medius) to the fr-ont of the ihac crest, where it anastomoses with the ascending branch of the exter- this has an nal circumflex artery. The other portion (c, mferior) is directed "j^'^'^^"" forwards over the middle of the smallest gluteal muscle, with the pLe. nerve, towards the anterior lower iliac spme where it enters the tensor of the fascia lata, and communicates with the external cir- cumflex branch (p. 628) : many offsets are furnished to the gluteus minimus, and some pierce that muscle to supply the hip joint.

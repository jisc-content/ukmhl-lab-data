About the middle of the forearm the ulnar nerve (■*) ap- proaches the artery and continues thence on the inner side. In the lower half it has a straight course to the pisifomi bone, and is covered by the teguments and fascia, and the flexor carpi ulnaris as far as the Avrist. To the outer side are the tendons of the flexor subhmis. Beneath it is the flexor profun- dus, C. Veins. Two companion veins accompany the ar- tery, as in the upper part, and are united across it at intervals. Nerves. The ulnar nerve (■•) lies close to, and on the inner side of the vessels ; and a small branch (^), sending twigs around the artery, courses to the palm of the hand. On the annular ligament of the wrist the arteiy has passed through the fascia and lies close to the pisiform bone. The ulnar nerve, with its palmar branch, still ac- companies the vessel on the inner side. Branches. The greater Fig. 81. Lower hal in relation with muscles. veins.

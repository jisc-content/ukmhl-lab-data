44 Branches. Long root lentiruliir ganglion. Long cilinr bnuiL-lies. DISSECTION OF THE ORBIT. the superior rectus and levator palpebraj muscles, and lies afterwards bclo-vv tlie superior oblique ; in tliis part of its course it furnishes the lolJowiiig- branches :— The branch to ihe lenticular ganglion is about halP an inch long and very slender, and arises as soon as the nerve comes into the orbit: this is the long- root of the lenticular ganglion, ■y Long ciliary branches. As the nasal cro.sscs the optic nerve, it supplies two or more ciliary branches (fig. 11) to the eyeball. Fig. 11.* Infra-trocli- lear tauKh. These lie on the inner side of the optic, and join the ciliary branches of the lenticular ganglion. The infra-trochlear branch ("■) arises as the nasal nerve is about to leave the cavity, and is directed forwards below the pulley of the superior oblique muscle, to end in the upper eyelid, the con- junctiva, and the side of the nose. Before this branch leaves the orbit it receives an offset of communication from the siipra-troch- lear nei-ve. * Second view of the orbit (Illustrations of Dissections). Muscles :— A.

291 ULNAR VESSELS AND NERVE. The superficud transverse ligament of the fingeis is a thin fibrous Jjjf band, which stretches across the roots of the four fingers, and is contained in the fold of skin, forming the rudiment of a web be- tween them. Beneath it the digital nerves and vessels are contmued onwards to their terminations. Sheath of the flexor tendons (fig. 82). Along each finger the flexor Shfat^ of^^ tendons are retained in place against the phalanges by a fibrous Fig. 82." tliickuess. Has a syno- vial sac. Dissection. Superficial palmar arch. sheath. Opposite the middle of each of the two nearest phalanges the sheath is formed by a strong fibrous band (e and/) (ligamcntum vagi- nale), which is almost tendinous in consistence ; but opposite the joints it consists of a thin membrane with scattered and oblique fibres. If the sheath be opened it will be seen to be lined by a synovial membrane, which forms long and slender vascular folds (vincula vasculosa) be- tween the tendons and the bones. Dissection. The palmar fascia, and the thinner parts of the digital sheaths opposite the joints of the fingers may be taken away. On the removal of the fascia the palmar arch of the ulnar arteiy, and the median and ulnar ner^^es, become apparent. Palmar Part of the Ulnar Artery (fig. 83). In the palm of the hand the ulnar artery is directed towards the muscles of the thumb, where it communicates Avith two ofEsets of the radial trunk, viz., the superficial volar branch (c), and the branch to the radial side of the fore- finger (/). The cm-ved part of the artery, which lies across the hand, is named the super- ficial palmar arch (d).—Its convexity is turned towards the fingers, and its position in the palm would be nearly marked by a line across the hand fi-om the cleft of the thumb. The arch is comparatively superficial; it is covered in greater part by the integuments and the palmar fascia, but at the inner border of the hand the palmaris brevis muscle (h) lies over it. Beneath it are the flexor tendons and the branches of the ulnar and median nerves. Venje comites lie on its sides. Branches. From the convexity of the arch proceed the digital Branches arteries, and from the concavity some small offsets to the palm of the hand. A small branch (profunda) arises as soon as the artery enters the hand. a.

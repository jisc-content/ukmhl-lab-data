SCAEPA'S TRIANGULAR SPACE. 617 ral vessels are to be followed downwards as far as the sartoiius Lmscfe On the outer side of the vessels elean the divisions of the ,eek nerves, rent erural nerve, together with the branches of an arteiy (pro- antenor crurai nerve, fo i-emovinff the fat from be- takeaway " ™: L°,rr."^^^^ contains tUe trunk, of the «ood c...... vessels of the thigh, and the anterior crural nerve, with lymphatics Fig. 193.* and fat. It measures commonly tlrree inches from above do'wn ; but extent, ^ the length varies Avith the breadth of the sartorius, and the height at which this muscle crosses inwards. * Dissection of Scarpa's triangular space (Illustrations of Dissections) Muscles: a.

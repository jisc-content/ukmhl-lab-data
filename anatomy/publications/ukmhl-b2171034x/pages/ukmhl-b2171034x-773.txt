767 STEUCTUEE OF MEMBRANOUS SACS. together with blood-vessels and nerves. _ ., . The outer fibrous covering is loose and flocculent, is easily outer, detached, and contains irregular pigment cells with ramifjrmg blood-vessels. The middle stratum (tunica propria) is clear and middle, tough, like the hyaloid membrane in the interior of the eyeball: its inner surface is irregular owing to slight eminences ; and in the ampulla of the semicircular tubes this layer forms the transverse projection. The inner one is formed by a layer of flattened jjmer. nucleated cells, which are continued over the eminences in the interior. In the region of the nerve, both in the ampulla of the semicircular tube and in the sacs, the epithelium is said to become columnar, and to have intermixed spindle-shaped nucleated cells (like the olfactorial), which possess hair-like processes at their free ends. The small calcareous masses, or the otoliths, consist of minute, otoliths elongated, six or eight-sided particles of carbonate of lime, which of^j^g"^ are pointed at the ends, and are situate in the inner part of the wall of the utricle and saccule. Within the enlargement of each semicircular tube there is also a calcareous material. * Petrous bone partly removed to show the membranous labyrinth in place (Breschet). a.

METATARSO-PHALANGEAL JOINTS. 717 Two synovial membranes are present in these tarso-metatarsal two syno- y vial mem- articulations. branes. There is one between the cuboid and the two outer metatarsals, which serves for the adjacent lateral articular surfaces of the bones: this is not always separate from the following. The second is placed in the joint between the external and middle cuneiforms with their metatarsal bones (third and second), and is fin offset of the common sjmovial membrane belonging to the articulation of the scaphoid with the cuneiform bones (p. 714) : prolongations from it are fm-nished to the lateral articular faces of the second, third, and fourth (inner side) metatarsals. Articular surfaces. The osseous surfaces are not flat; for the Form of metatarsal bones are undulating, and the tarsal are uneven to fft ' into the others. Movement. From the wedge-shaped form of the metatarsal bones a slight movement from above down is obtainable ; and tills is greatest in the little toe and the next. In the little toe there is an abductory and adductoiy motion; and a small degi'ee of the same exists in the fourth toe. adduction. Dissection. All the superficial ligaments having been taken away. Separate the the interosseous ligaments of the tarsus and metatarsus may be seen l^^teroi^'^^ by separating forcibly the cuneiform bones from one another and seous. fi'om the OS cuboides ; the latter bone from the os scaphoides ; and the bases of the metatarsals from one another. The dissector will find that, in using force, the bones will sometimes tear sooner than the ligaments. IMetatarsus with phalanges. These are condyloid joints, in Union of which the head of the metatarsal bone is received into the cavity "lui ^liT^"^ of the phalanx. lauges, by Each articulation has two lateral and an inferior ligament, as in two lateral the hand; and the joint is further strengthened above by an ex-and inferior: pansion derived from the tendons of the extensors of the toes. A distinct synovial membrane exists in each joint. In the articulation of the great toe there are two sesamoid bones, synovial which are connected with the inferior and lateral ligaments. All these structm-es are better seen in the hand, where they are more distinct; and their anatomy is more fully described with the dissection of that part. (See page 322.) Surfaces of bone. The metatarsal bone has a rounded head, which Form of is longest from above down, and reaches farthest on the plantar surface. On the end of the phalanx is a cup-shaped cavity. Movement. In this condyloid joint as in the hand, there is angular Kind of motion in four different directions, with circumduction. motion. Flexion and extension. Wlicn the joint is bent the phalanx passes Bonding under the head of the metatarsal bone ; and when it is extended extond- the phalanx moves back beyond a straight line with the metatarsal bone. A limit to flexion is set by the meeting of the bones, by the st^ito of stretching of the fore part of the lateral ligaments, and by the = extensor tendon ; and to extension, by the tightness of the inferior

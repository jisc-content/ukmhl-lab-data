ARTERIES OF THE BRAIN. 181 site the foramen magnum, and ramifies in tlie dura mater lining the fossa of the occipital bone. ., , i ^ t> i (1. The inferior cerebellar artei-y (posterior ) is distributed to the ui'iiler the under surface of the cerebellum. Taking origin from the end v^^^^^ of the vertebral, this branch winds backwards round the medul a, between tlie pneumo-gastric and spinal accessoiy nerves, to the Fis. 52*. median fissm-e of the cerebellum. Directed onwards along the fissure the artery reaches the upper surface of the small brain, and there anastomoses with the superior cerebellar artery. An ofEset of this branch ramifies over the under part of the offsets, cerebellum, and ends externally by anastomosing with the artery of the upper surface. As the vessel lies by the side of the apertm-e of the fourth ventricle it gives a small choroid twig to the plexus of that cavity. The BASILAR ARTERY ("), formed by the union of the two verte- BasUar brals, reaches from the lower to the upper border of the pons, where it ends by di%ading into two branches (posterior cerebral) ^^^^^^ "-"'^ for the cerebrum. The vessel touches the basilar process of the situation, occipital bone, from that circumstance receiving its name, and lies in the median groove of the pons. On each side of, and almost parallel to it is the sixth nerve. Branches. Besides the two terminal branches mentioned above. Branches: tlie artery supplies transverse oflEsets to the pons and the under part of the cerebellum, and a large branch to the upper surface of the cerebellum. * Arteries at the base of the brain. 1.

300 DISSECTION OF THE HAND. Arrange- ment. Action ns flexors and extensors. carpal bones between which they lie. The dorsal muscles are thus allotted to the digits :—two belong to the second finger, a tliird is connected with the radial side of the fore, and the fourth with the ulnar side of the ring finger. Action. They help to bend the metacarpo-phalangeal joints by their attachment to the first phalanx; and will assist in the extension 86. t as alDcluctors and adduc- tors. Dissection. Annular ligament of front of ■wrist of the two last phalangeal joints through their union with the extensor tendon. Further, the interossei can separate and approximate the straight- ened fingers :—thus the palmar set adduct to the second finger ; and the dorsal abduct fi-om the middle line of the second finger— the two fixed to this digit moving it to the right and left of that line. Dissection. The attachments of the annular ligament to the carpal bones on each side are to be next dissected out by takmg away the small muscles of the thumb and little finger. Before reading its description, the ends of the cut hgament may be placed in appo- sition, and fixed with a stitch. The anterior annular ligament is a firm ligamentous band, which arches over and binds down the flexor tendons of the fingers. It is attached externally to the fi-ont of the os scaphoides, and to the fore and inner parts, and ridge of the os trapezium ; and mternally to the unciform and pisiform bones. By its upper border it is con- nected Avith the aponeurosis of the forearm ; and by its anterior surface it is joined by the palmar fascia. On it lie the palmaris longus and the ulnar artery and nerve. * Three palmar interosseous muscles, a. Muscle of the little finger; 6, of the ring finger ; and c, of the forefingei*. + Four dorsal interosseous muscles, d. Muscle of the forefinger, called sometimes abductor indicis. c and /. Muscles of the middle finger, g. Muscle of the ring finger.

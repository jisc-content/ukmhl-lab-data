740 DISSECTION OF THE EAR. outer end, extremity IS dilated, and the posteiior edge projects farther than the anterior ; the greater portion of the margin is rough, and gives at- tachment to the cartilage of the pinna. The inner end is smaller, and IS marked in the dry bone by a groove for the insertion of the membrane of the tympanum ; it is so sloped that the anterior wall ]uts beyond the posterior by about two lines. In the fetus the osseous part of the meatus is absent. After biiih it grows out of the osseous ring (tympanic bone) which supports the membrana tympani. nSane ..^^'^'''^^ meatus.

Condition in the fetus. glands. the cartilaginous portion; it is continued over the membrane of the tympanum in the form of a thin pelhcle. At the entrance of the meatus are a few hairs. In the subcutaneous tissue over the carti- Cerujuinous lags of the meatus lie some ceruminous glands of a yellow-brown colour, resembling in form and arrangement the sweat glands of the skin ; these secrete the ear wax, and open on the surface by separate orifices : they are absent in the osseous part, and are most abundant in that small portion of the tube which is formed by fibrous tissue. Vessels and nerves. The meatus receives its arteries from the pos- terior auricular, the internal maxillary, and the temporal branch of Xen'es. the external carotid (p. 80). Its nerves are derived from the auriculo- temporal branch of the fifth nerve, and enter the auditory passage between the bone and the cartilage (p. 91). * Vertical section of the meatus auditorius and tympanum (Scarpa), a.

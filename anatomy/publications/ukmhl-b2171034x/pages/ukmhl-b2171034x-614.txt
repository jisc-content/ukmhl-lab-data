DISSECTION OF THE TELVIS. 598 mc^nw'r'"" I^i^^MKNTS OF THE INNOMINATE BoNES (fig. 189). Tlie innominate iiil. bm'iU. ^'ones are xinited in front, at the pubic symphysis, by an interposed piece of cartilage and special ligaments ; and behind, each is con- nected with the transverse process of the last lumbar vertebra by a separate band (iho-lumbar). In tlie centre of the bone is a mem- branous structure closing the thyroid aperture. Ilio-luiulmr The ilio-lumhar or ilio-vertehral ligament is triangular in form, and is divided into fasciculi. Internally it is attached to the tip of the transverse process of the last lumbar vertebra ; externally the Pig. ISO.* fibres spread out, and are inserted into the iliac-crest for about an inch, opposite the posterior part of the ihac fossa. To the upper border of the ligament the fascia lumborum is attached: its posterior surface is covered by the quadratus lumborum, and its anterior by the iliacus muscle. The thin ohturator menibrane (fig. 189, h) closes almost entirely the thyroid foramen, and is composed of fibres crossing in diiferent directions. It is attached to the bony margin of the foramen, except above wliere the obturator vessels pass tlu-ough ; and towards the lower part of the aperture it is connected to the pelvic aspect of the hip-bone.

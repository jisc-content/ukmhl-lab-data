MUSCLES OF THE TONGUE. 151 Only the two parts of the hyo-glossus (basic ^^^d er t^^^^^^^^^^^ O ch^-dro- p. 95), which arise fi-om the body and great wmg of the hyoid bone, are refeiTed to above. To lay bare the third part or the chondio- glossus, K, which is a small muscular slip attached to the small coinu of the OS hyoides, turn upwards the dorsum of the tongue, and feel for the small cornu of the hyoid bone tlu-ough the mucous membrane. Then remove the raucous membrane in fi-ont of the cornu, and the fibres of the muscle radiating forwards will be visible. ^ , • , The palato and stylo-cjlossus musde8, jy and ^a,^^ P^™^^^ Fig. 37." the glossus J Fibres. bined at their attachment to the lateral part of the tongue, form, together with the following muscle, an expansion over anterior two thirds of the dorsum be- neath the superficial lingiialis. In this stratum the fibres radiate fi'om the pouit of contact of the muscles with the tongue—some passing almost hori- zontally inwards to the middle, and others obliquely fonvards to the tip of the organ. A great portion of the stylo-glossus is du-ected along the side of the tongue ; and some fibres are inchned to -the under sm-face m fi-ont of the hyo- glossus, to jom those of the opposite muscle beneath the tip. Hyo-(jlossus. The two superficial parts of the muscle (basic- and cerato- glossus, G, p. 95) enter the under siu^ace of the tongue, between the stylo-glossus and the Idngualis. After entering that surface by sepai-ate bundles, they are bent round the mar- gin, and form, with the two preceding muscles, a stratum on the dorsum of the tongue. The third part of the muscle, or the chondro-glossus, F, is distinct jf^glj^^^Jf'*' from the rest. About two or three lines wide at its origin fi'om the glossus, root of the small cornu, and fi'om part of the body of the os hyoides, origin, the muscle enters beneath the upper lingualis, and passes obliquely ending in inwards over the posterior third of the dorsum, to blend with the ''^"^ tongue, hyo-glossus. Cortex of the tongue. The muscles above described, together with Muscular the superficial lingualis, constitute a cortical layer of oblique and tongue, longitudinal fibres, which covers the tongue, except below where some muscles arc placed, and resembles " a slipper turned upside down." This stratum is pierced by deeper fibres. The genio-hyo-glossus (fig. 38, '^) enters the tongue vertically on An-ange the side of the septum, and perforates the cortical covering to end j."^'g^ * Muscles on the surface of the tongue. A.

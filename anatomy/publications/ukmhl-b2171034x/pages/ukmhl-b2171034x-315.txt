The large artery of the thumb (e) {^^^^^^^^^^^ (art princeps pollicis) runs between the first metacarpal bone and ^^.^^^ the flexor brevis pollicis, to the interval between the heads of the thetlmmb. muscle, where it divides into the two collateral branches of the thumb : these are distributed like the arteries of the superficial arch (p. 292). ^. _ .^.pwof e. The digital branch of the index finger (d) (art. radiahs indicis) f^^^^^. is directed over the first dorsal interosseous muscle, J, and beneath linger, the short flexor and the adductor pollicis, to the radial side of the forefinger. At the anterior border of the adductor pollicis, D, this branch is usually connected by an offset with the superficial palmar arch ; and at the end of the digit it unites with the branch furnished to the opposite side by the ulnar artery. The dee}) branch of the ulnar nerve accompanies the arch of the ^/fP^!;j:^"'=^ radial artery as far as the muscles of the thumb, and terminates nerve, in offsets to the adductor pollicis and the inner head of the short flexor. Branches. Near its origin the nerve furnishes branches to the Muscular muscles of the little finger. In the palm it gives offsets to all the °fi'«<^ts. palmar and dorsal interosseous muscles, and to the inner two lum- brical muscles (•''), besides the terminal branches before mentioned. The transverse metacarpal ligament connects together the heads of Ligament of the four inner metacarpal bones. Its cutaneous surface is hollowed iJfetearpal where the flexor tendons cross it ; and beneath it the interossei ijones. muscles pass to their insertion. To the posterior border the fascia covering the interossei muscles is united. The ligament should now be taken away to see the interossei muscles. The INTEROSSEI MUSCLES, SO named fi-om their position between the Seven inter- , 1 • 1 m 1 1 ossei mus- metacarpal bones, are seven m number. Iwo muscles occupy each ejes, space, except in the first Avhere there is onlj' one ; they arise from the metacarpal bones, and are inserted into the first phalanx of the fingers. They are divided into palmar and dorsal interossei ; but di^-ided into all the small muscles are evident in the palm of the hand, though anJ}"dorsal some project more than the others. The palmar muscles (fig. 85), three in number, are smaller than Number and the dorsal set, and are most prominent in the palm of the hand. paimai°^ They arise from the palmar surface of the metacarpal bones of the fingers on which they act, viz., those of the fore, ring, and little fingers ; and they are inserted into the ulnar side of the fore, and the radial side of the otlier two digits. Both sets of muscles have a similar termination (fig. 82, &) :— Common in- the fibres end in a tendon, which is inserted into the side of the first ^otii""cts^ or metacarpal phalanx, and sends an expansion to join the extensor tendon on the dorsum of the bone.

145 FACIAL NERVE IN THE BONE. Facial nerve being traced to it; and the meatus auditorius is to he laid open, to see the facial and auditory nerves in that hollow. The course of the chorda tympani nerve (hranch of the fac al) of^^'-;'- across the tympanum will be brought into sight by the removal of the central ear bone, the incus. This nei-ve may be also followed to the facial through the wall of the cavity behind, as well as out of the cavity in front. The remaining branches of the facial nei-ve in the bone are very and other minute, and are not to be seen except on a fi-esh piece of the skull which has been softened in acid. The student may there- Fig. 35.* fore omit the paragraphs marked with an asterisk, till he is able to obtain a part on which a careful examination can be made. The facial nerve (fig. 35, is received mto the internal auditory meatus, and entering the aqueduct of Fallopius at the bottom of that hollow, is conducted through the tem- poral bone to the stylo-mas- toid foramen and the face (p. 36). In its serpentine course thi-ough the bone, the nerve is first directed out- wards to the inner wall of the tympanum : at that spot it bends backwards, and is marked by a gangliform is marked swelling (intumescentia gangliformis), to wliich several small nerves wiifcr^^'"^ are united. From this swelling the nerve is continued through the ^^^'j®,^}''^'' arched aqueduct, to the aperture of exit from the bone. The hranches of the nerve in the bone sei-ve chiefly to connect it with other nerves ; but one supplies the tongue, and another the stapedius muscle. ° Connecting branches communicate with the auditoiy and glosso- Branches pharyngeal neiwes ; and -with two trunks (superior and inferior i^e'rv"" maxillary) of the fifth nerve. Union loith the auditory nerve. In the bottom of the meatus to aiulitory, the facial and auditory nerves are connected by one or two minute filaments. * Connecting hranches of the gangliform enlargement. Tiie swelling to superior of the facial nerve receives three small twigs. One in front is the "y'Jj^Jp''^,^ large superficial petrosal nevye"^ {y'lilLmvL) ; another is the small super- wuisynipa- ficial petrosal' of the tympanic nerve ; and the thhd is the external *''^'^*''^> * Nerves joining the enlargement of the facial nerve, 1.

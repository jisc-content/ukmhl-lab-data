SPHENO-PALATINE AND OTIC GANGLIA, FACIAL AND NASAL NERVES, AND FINAL BRANCHES OF THE INTERNAL MAXILLARY VESSELS. Tlie preparation of Meckel's ganglion and its branches (fig. 34), Brandies of and of the terminal branches of the internal maxillary artery, is a difficult task, in consequence of the nerves and A'-essels being con- * Nerves of the septum of the nose. 1.

91 INFERIOR DENTAL NERVE. The ptemoid branches come from both parts of the inferior n-^n j^ t« niaxiUary nerve. muscles:— Tlie branch or branches to the external ptenjgoid springs fromtlie extemal smaller piece of the trmik, or from the buccal nerve, and enters the under surface of the muscle. The nen-e to the internal iJiei-ycjoid arises fi-om the large part ol internal, tlie maxillary trunk close to the s'iaill, and maybe followed beneath the upper border to the deep surface of its muscle ; it will be learnt in the dissection of the otic ganglion (Section 14). The buccal branch ('), longer and larger than the others, perfo-Buccinatoi rates the external pterygoid, and is directed inwards, beneath the coronoid process to the surface of the buccinator, where it ends in terminal branches. As it perforates the pteiygoid muscle filaments are given to the fleshy substance ; and after it has passed through ^^^f^l^^ the iibres it furnishes a branch to the temporal muscle. The nerve is directed towards the angle of the mouth, supplying the integu- ment, the buccinator muscle, and the lining mucous membrane. It ^^'^^jj^™"^*;"^^^ is united fi-eely with the facial nerve, the two forming a plexus. The LARGER PART of the inferior maxillary nerve divides into ^,^"j°7 three tnmks—auriculo-temporal, dental, and gustatory. A few of |Jjf'-^';i<j'^^.. the fibrils of the small (motor) root are applied to it, and are con- veyed to certain muscles, viz. tensor tympani, circumflexus palati, pterygoideus internus, mylo-hyoideus, and digastricus. The AUKICULO-TEIIPORAL NERVE (*) Separates fi'om the others ^mpw^ near the base of the skull, and has commonly two roots. Its course to the surface of the head is directed first backwards be- neath the external pterygoid muscle, as far as the articulation of j^®^ Ijeneath the jaw ; and then upwards with the temporal artery in fi'ont of the ear. The nerve furnishes branches to the surrounding parts, braiiiches^^^ viz., the joint, the ear, and the parotid gland ; and it communicates with the facial nerve. Its ramifications on the head are described at page 8. In the part now dissected its branches are the follow- ing :— a. Branches of the meatus auditorius. Two offsets are given to *° t''"' the meatus from the point of union of the branches of the facial with the auriculo-temporal nerve, and enter that tube between the cartilage and bone. b. Auricular branch. The branch to the joint of the jaw arises near the same spot as the preceding, or from the branches to the meatus. " "'"'^^' c. The inferior auricular branch supplies the external ear below the ear, and the meatus auditorius : it sends offsets along the internal maxillaiy -nrteiy, which communicate with the sympathetic nerve. d. Parotid branches. These small filaments ramify in the gland, parotid; e. Communicating branches. Two or more branches around the ex- to join facial temal carotid artery communicate with the facial and sympathetic thetiT"^"'' nei-ves. The INFERIOR DENTAL (^) is the largest of the three trunks of the inferior inferior maxillary nen^e. In its course to the canal in the lower '^""^^ jaw, the ner^'e is external to the gustatory, and lies at first beneath is between the external pterygoid muscle ; it is aftenvards placed on the in- }^usi:£'^

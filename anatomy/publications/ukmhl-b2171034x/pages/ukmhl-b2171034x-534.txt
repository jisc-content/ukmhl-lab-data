At the one end (farther) each tube is dilated into the Malpighian corpuscle (h) â€¢ and at the other it passes into a straight tube or joins an " arch " at the base of the pyramid. The " looped Fig. 162 * Fig. lC3.t mixed with looped tubes : structure. Malpighian hodies, position; size and composi- tion. The capsiTle; liow fonned, Tlie blood- vessels, tubes" of Henle (fig. 162) have the same arrangement in the cortical substance as the larger tubuli uiiniferi. The wall of the convoluted tubes consists of a thin basement membrane, and is lined by a thick, nucleated, and granular epithe- lium. Malpighian corpuscles (fig. 164, a). These small bodies are con- nected with the fi-ee ends of the convoluted tubes, one to each : and are arranged in double rows in the cortical substance between the pyramids, one row being on each side of an interpyramidal branch of artery, from which they receive twigs ; each measures about i-|^th of an inch, and consists of an incasing capsule with an enclosed tuft of bloodvessels (glomerulus). The capsule (5) is the dilated end of the convoluted tube, and is perforated at the extremity by two small bloodvessels. Its wall , consists of a thin basement membrane, and is lined by a transparent laminar eiaithelium. * The glomerulus (fig. 164, b) is formed by the intercommunications * Plan of the arrangement of the nriuiferal tubes, a.

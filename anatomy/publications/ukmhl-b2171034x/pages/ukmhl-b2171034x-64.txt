48 DISSECTION OF THE OllBIT. Uiiper mill lower, and two I'OHtigUOUK ssect infe- rior obliiiuc. Ihe upper and the lower rectus elevate and depress tl.e fore part of the ball around a transverse axis; but as their fibres are directed obhquely outwards, the upper muscle turns the pupil up and in and tlie lower muscle turns it down and in. By the simultaneous action of two contiguous recti, the ball will be moved to a point intermediate to that to which it would be directed by either muscle singly. Dissection. By opening tlie optic foramen, tlie attachment of the recti muscles will be more fully laid bare. To dissect out the Fig. 12.* Lower obliqnc muscle. inferior oblique muscle, let the ej'^eball be replaced in its natural position ; then by taldng away the conjunctival Iming of the lower eyelid near the inner part of the orbit, and removing some fat, the muscle will appear beneath the eyeball, bending fi-om the inner to the outer side : it may be followed outwards to its insertion into the ball. The INFERIOR OBLIQUE MUSCLE (fig. 12, ") is situatc near the anterior margin of the orbit, and differs fi-om the other muscles in being directed across, instead of parallel to the axis of the orbit. * Third view of the orbit (inustratioris of Dissections). Muscles :—a. Upper rectus and levator palpebriE thrown back together, f. External rectus, c. Inferior rectus. t>. Internal rectus, f. Upper oblique cut, showing the insertion, ii. Insertion of inferior oblique. Nerves:—1. Upper branch of the third. 2. Sixth nerve. 3. Inferior oblique branch of the tliird. i. Branch of third to inferior rectus. 5.

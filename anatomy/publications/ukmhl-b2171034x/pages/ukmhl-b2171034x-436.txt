Connected ^vith the lower end of the rectum are four muscles, viz. a fine cuticular muscle, and two sphincters (external and internal) with the levator ani. Corrugator cutis anif (fig. 129, •"'). This thin subcutaneous layer of involuntary muscle surrounds the anus with radiating fibres. Externally it blends with the subdermic tissue outside the internal sphincter ; and internally it enters the anus and ends in the sub- mucous tissue within the sphincter. * A view of the dissection of the rectal half of the perinEeum (Illustrations of Dissections).

647 GEMELLI AND OBTURATOR INTERNUS. Muscular branches of the sacral plexus are furnished to the gluteus UMv ma^mus and to the external rotators except the obturator externus. Branches of gluteus. One or more brandies of the plexus enter the upper fibres of the gluteus maximus (fig. 198). IVo branches for the pyriformis enter the under surface, and are Branch of learnt with the sacral plexus in the pelvis (p. 5G7). The nerve to the obturator internus (fig. 199, arises from the Nen^of _ upper part of the plexus, and is directed to its muscle through the small sacro-sciatic notch with the pudic nerve : its termination is seen in the dissection of the pelvis (p. 567). The nei-ve to the superior gemellus (fig. 199, ^ is a very small "ffXT' twig, and arises separately from the following ; it enters the inner end of the muscle on the superficial surface. The nerve to the inferior gemellus and the quadratus (fig. 199, ^) '^^^^^ is a slender branch, which passes with a companion artery beneath and quad- tlie gemelli and the obturator internus, to end in the two muscles ^^t'^, from which it receives its designation. Tliis nerve will be seen more fully in a subsequent dissection, when articular filaments '^^^^^'^ from it to the hip joint may be recognised. Dissection. To see the remaining small rotator muscles, hook aside the great sciatic nerve, and take away the branches of the sciatic artery if it is necessary. In cleaning these muscles the Umb should be rotated inwards. The gemelli are to be separated fi-om the tendon of the obturator internus. The SUPERIOR GEMELLUS (fig. 198, '^) is the highest of the two Superior muscular shps along the sides of the tendon of the obturator gemeUus. muscle. Internally it is attached to the outer and lower part of the ischial spine, and externally it is inserted with the obturator into the great trochanter. Oftentimes the muscle is absent. The INFERIOR GEMELLUS (fig. 198, ^) is larger than its fellow, gg^^g^^g Its origin is connected with the upper part of the ischial tuberosity, along the lower edge or lip of the groove for the obturator internus muscle ; and its insertion is the same as that of the obturator tendon, ^^yj"'^^^^ This muscle is placed between the obturator internus and quad- rator. ratus, but near the femur the tendon of the obturator externus comes into contact with its lower border. Action. These small fleshy slips seem to be but accessory pieces Use to iielp of origin to the internal obturator, with which they combine in use. The OBTURATOR INTERNUS (fig 198, °) arises from the innominate Obturator bone inside the pelvis (p. 594), and passes to the exterior tlu-ough the small sacro-sciatic notch. The tendon of the muscle is directed outwards over the hip joint, and is inserted viiih. the gemelli into the outside top of the great trochanter, in fi'ont of the ijyriformis, as well as P®^^> into the contiguous portion of the neck of the femur. Outside the pelvis the obturator is mostly tendinous, and is em- lies over hip braced by the gemelli muscles in the following way : near the pelvis the gemelli meet beneath, but near the trochanter they cover the tendon. Beneath the obturator is a synovial sac. Crossing the muscle are the large and small sciatic nerves and the sciatic vessels ;

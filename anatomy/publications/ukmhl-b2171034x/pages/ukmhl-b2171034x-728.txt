712 DISSECTION OF THE LEG. internal. and inferior ligaments. The last is strongest, and divided into two parts: divided into two pieces, or it may be situate at the outer border of the foot. At the inner side of the os cuboides is a stronger internal band (fig. 221,/) from the os calcis ; this is fixed behind to the upper part of the os calcis, external to the hand to the scaphoid bone, and in front to the contiguous inner side of the os cuboides. The inferior calcaneo-cuhoid ligament in the sole of the foot (fig. 222) is much the strongest, and is divided into a superficial and a deep part:— The superficial portion, ligatnentum longum planta: ('), is attached to the under surface of the os calcis from near the posterior to the Fig. 223.t superficial and anterior tubercle; its fibres pass forwards to be connected with the ridge on the under surface of the cuboid bone ; but the most in- ternal are continued over the tendon of the peroneus longus muscle, assisting to form its sheath, and are inserted into the bases of the third and fourth metatarsal bones, deep band. The deep piece of the ligament (fig. 223, &), seen on division of the superficial (a), extends from the tubercle and the hollow on the fore part of the under surface of the os calcis, to the cuboid bone internal or i^osterior to the ridge. * Plantar ligaments of the foot (Boiu-gery).—1.

425 PEEINiEAL ARTERY AND NERVES. Air blo%vn beneath the fascia passes forwards to the scrotum ; course of and this direction is given to it by the deep connections of that membrane with parts around. Should urine be effused beneath the urine, superficial fascia, the fluid will necessarily be directed forwards, like the air, through the scrotum to the penis and the fi'ont of the abdomen. ^ _ ^ i ^. Dissection. The superficial vessels and nerves are to be dissected D.s^secfaon on the right side of the perina^um, by cutting through the super- and vessels ficial fascia in the same manner as on the left side. The long ^'8^ slender artery then visible is the superficial perinaeal, which gives a transverse branch near its commencement. Two superficial periuccal nerves accompany the artery ; and the inferior pudendal nerve is to be traced forwards to the scrotum. Communications are to be sought between these neives anteriorly, and between one of the perinaaal and the inferior hajmorrhoidal posteriorly ; and all the nerves are to be followed backwards. Arteries (fig. 130). The superficial and transverse perinseal ^^ifj^'^^jl'^ arteries beneath the fascia are branches of the pudic, and are two pudic. or thi-ee in number. The superficial perinceal branch (fig. 130, h), arising at the fore Superficial part of the ischio-rectal fossa, runs over or under the transverse pe^seal muscle, and beneath the superficial fascia to the back of the scrotmn, where it ends in flexuous branches. As the vessel lies ^^^^^^^^ internal to the pubic arch, it supplies offsets to the muscles beneath ; and in front it anastomoses with the external or superficial pudic branches of the femoral artery. Sometimes there is a second and supplies , , , muscles, pennseal branch. The transverse artery of the perineeum (fig. 130, a) arises from J^^JJ.^'^^''^'^ the preceding, and is directed transversely to the middle of the perineal space, where it is distributed to the integuments and the muscles between the urethi-a and the rectum. It anastomoses with the one of the opposite side. Branches of veins accompany the arteries, and open into the Veins with trunk of the pudic vein : those with the superficial perinteal artery are plexifonn at the scrotum. Nerves (fig. 130). There are three cutaneous nerves of the scrotum Cutaneous on each side, viz. inferior pudendal of the small sciatic, and two scrotum, superficial perineal branches of the pudic nerve. The superficial perineal nerves, two in number, are named anterior Two super- and posterior from their relative position : both arise in the ischio- uiealV^*^"' rectal fossa from the perinasal branch of the pudic nerve (p. 422). The posterior branch, (^) is continued forwards, beneath the super- Posterior ficial fascia, with the artery of the same name to the back of the toTlir ^"^^'"^ scrotum. Whilst in the fossa the nerve gives inwards an offset to scrotiun, the integuments in front of the anus ; and this communicates with the inferior hajmorrhoidal nerve. The anterior branch (^) passes under the transverse muscle, and and anterior accompanies the other to the scrotum.

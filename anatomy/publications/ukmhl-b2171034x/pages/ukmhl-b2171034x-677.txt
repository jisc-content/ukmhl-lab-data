Above is the gluteus minimus, whose tendon is united with the upper and outer band of the capsule; and below is the obturator extemus. Dissection (fig. 204). The capsular hgament is to be now divided over the prominence of the head of the femur, and this bone being disarticulated but not detached, the cotyloid and interarticular hga- ments inside it will appear. The interarticular or round ligament is attached to the acetabulum by two pieces ; and to bring these into Aaew, the synovial membrane and areolar tissue must be removed. The transverse ligament OA'^er the notch is also to be defined. The cotyloid ligament (fig. 189, g) is a naiTow band of fibro- cartilage, which is fixed to the margin of the acetabulum, and is prolonged across the notch on the inner side, so as to form part of the transverse ligament. Its fibres are not continued around the acetabulum, but are fixed to the margin of the cavity, and cross one another in the band. It is thickest at its attachment to the Cut open the capsule.

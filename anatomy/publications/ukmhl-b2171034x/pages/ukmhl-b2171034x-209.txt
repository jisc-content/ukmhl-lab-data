The continuation of the tract ascends beneath the olivary body, and leaving the surface of the medulla enters the pass deeply. "^Tllliiocmj body, and its fillet (fig. 67, c). The olivary mass oi'vary consists of three parts, viz. a gray incasing layer, a nucleus, and a composi- band prolonged from it—the fillet. Fig. 57.* When the olivary body has been sliced obliquely, a very thin corpus wavy layer of gray substance surrounding a nucleus of whitish tientatum matter will be apparent: this is the corpus dentatum (fig. 58,/). It forms a thin plaited capsule or bag, having a zigzag outline in a section, with the dilatation towards the surface, and the narrowed is an incom- neck open and directed backwards near the middle line.

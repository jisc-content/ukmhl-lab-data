These are said to be five in mnnber :—two posterior, two lateral, and one superior. The posterior lirjament (one on each side) reaches from the back two poste- of the pelvis to the bladder, and contains the obliterated hypogastric arteiy, the ureter, and smaller vessels, and nerves. Between these is the hollow of the recto-vesical pouch. The lateral lirjament, also one on each side, the widest, is reflected two lateral, from the side of the bladder to the iliac-fossa and the wall of the pelvis. Along its line of attachment to the bladder is the obliterated liypogastric arteiy.

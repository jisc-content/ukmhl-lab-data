57 BRANCHES OF CERVICAL PLEXUS. and a chain of lymphatic ghnuls hes along the sterno-mastoid muscle. The spinal accessory nerve, is directed obhqnely across jj^^ . this interval from the sterno-mastoid muscle, which it pierces, to a,;cessory the under surface of the trapezius ; and a communication takes place nerve, between it and the spinal nerves in the space. , . , SurEUFicLVL Branches of the Cervical Plexus. Behind the Nerv^s^of^^ sterno-mastoid muscle appear the ramifications of the cervical ^.i^^as nerves in the plexus of the same name ; and superficial branches are furnished from these both upwards and downwards. The ASCENDING SET (fig. 14) are three in number, viz. small occipital, great auricular, and superficial cervical. The small occipital branch (fig. 2, comes from the second SmaJi^^^ cerNacal ners-e, and is directed upwards to the head along the pos- terior border of the sterno-mastoid muscle. At first the nerve is beneath the fascia; but near the occiput it becomes cutaneous, and is distributed between the ear and the great occipital nerve (p. 8). Occasionally there is a second cutaneous nerve to the head. The great auricidar nerve (fig. 2, 0 is a branch of the part of ^^^^^'^'^^ the plexus formed by the second and third cervical nerves. Per- forating the deep fascia at the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid muscle, the nerve is directed upwards beneath the platysma to the lobule of the ear, where it ends in the following branches :— T\iQ facial branches are sent forwards to the integuments over the ^^^^^'^^ parotid, and a few slender filaments pass thi-ough the gland to join the facial nerve. The auricular branches ascend to the external ear, and are chiefly auriciilai-, distributed on its cranial aspect ; one or more reach the opposite surface by piercing the pinna. On the ear they communicate with branches fmnished from the facial and pneumogastric nerves. The mastoid branch is directed backwards to the integuments inastoid , , , , ., 1 • • • .1 . • biauohes. between the ear and the mastoid process ; and it ]oms the posterior auricular branch of tlie facial nerve (p. 8). The superficial cervical nerve (fig. 2, springs from the same Superacial source as the preceding, and turns forwards round the sterno-mastoid JierVe!'' muscle about the middle. Afterwards it pierces the fascia and platysma, and ramifies over the anterior triangular space (see p. 59). There may be more than one branch to represent this neiwe. The DESCENDING SET of branches (fig. 2), (supra-cla-^ncular) are Nen-es that derived from the third and fourth nerves of the plexus, and are '^'^'''•'^'^'^'^ directed towards the clavicle over the lower part of the triangular space. Their number is somewhat uncertain, but usually there are about three on the clavicle. The most internal branch (sternal) crosses the clavicle near its sup^a-cIa^•i- inner end ; the middle branch lies about the middle of that bone ; and the posterior (acromial) turns over the attachment of the trapezius to the acromion. All arc distributed in the integuments of the chest and shoulder. Derived from tlic descending set are two or vnovQ posterior cutaneous Posterior cervical nerves, which ramify in the integument over the lower two of nock'.""'' tliirds of the fore part of the trapezius.

273 TRICEPS EXTENSOR OF ELBOW. BACK OF THE ARM. Position. During the examination of the back of the arm, the limb is to be raised in a semiflexed position by means of a block beneath the elbow. The scapula is to be brought nearly in a line with the humerus, so as to tighten the muscular fibres ; and it is to be fastened with hooks in that position. Dissection (fig. 79). On the back of tlie arm there is one muscle, the triceps, with the musculo-spiral nei-ve and superior profunda vessels. The skin having been Position (f the part. How to lay bare the triceps, Fig. 79. reflected already, the muscle will be laid bare readily, for it is covered only by fascia. To take away the fascia, cany an inci- sion along the middle of the limb to a little below the elbow ; and in reflecting it, the sub- aponeurotic loose tissue should be removed at the same time. Separate the middle fi-om the inner and outer heads of the muscle ; and trace the musculo- spu-al nerve and vessels beneath it. Define the outer head which reaches down to the spot at which the musculo-spiral nerve appears on the outer side. The TRICEPS MUSCLE (fig. 79^) is divided superiorly into thi-e'e heads of origin, inner, outer, and middle : two of these are attached to the humerus, and one to the scapula. The middle piece, or head, a, IS the longest, and has a tench- nous origin, about an inch wide, from the inferior costa of the scapula close to the glenoid cavity, where it is united with the capsule of the shoulder joint I^e outer luad, is narrow and arises fi-om the back of the -IwtC:^.*'^^^^^^^^^^^ fcl ner,e, and of the tricep. -ith a bit of whalebone beneath it to °^ *^ ^'^^er head, the humerus, o.

On the ampullary enlargement of the semicircular tubes the nerve in the tubes enters the external side, where it forms a forked eminence (Steifen- p^.oJge^^s sand), corresponding with the projection in the interior. The nerve ^^j^ branch- divides at first into two chief pieces, which are directed to the sides ; ing, end and it is doubtful whether branches extend into the tube beyond those eminences. Finally filaments pierce the wall of the tube, and forming a sub-epithelial plexus of nerve-fibres, as in the utricle, are supposed to be connected with similar auditorial cells. * Distribution of nei-ves^ to the membranous labyrinth (Breschet). a.

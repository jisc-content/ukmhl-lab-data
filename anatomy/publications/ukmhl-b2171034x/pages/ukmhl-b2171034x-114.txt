DISSECTION OP THE SUBMAXILLARY REGION. 98 fan'S-'" ^^'jtli the tliree trunks of the fiftli nen^e, and com- glioui municates with sensory, motory, and sympathetic nerves. It is natui-e; smaller in size than the lenticular ganglion, is sometimes rather red, and is placed above the deep process of the submaxillaiy gland. Offsets proceed upwards to connect it with other nerves; and from the lower part arise the branches to tlie adjacent structures. iS'S" '"^^^^ nervesâ€”roots. Two or three branches, in the form of loops, pass from the ganglion to the gustatoiy nerve. At Fig. 23.* and sym- pathetic nerves. Branches. Chorda tympani; course. the posterior part the ganglion is fm-ther joined by an offset fi-om the chorda tympani (of the facial nerve) which lies m contact with the gustatory. And its sympathetic branch comes from the ner^'^es around the facial artery. Branches. From the lower part of the ganglion five or six branches descend to the substance of the submaxillary gland ; and fi"om the fore part other filaments are furnished to the mucous membrane of the mouth and the Wliartonian duct. Chorda tympani. Joining the gustatory above by fibrils (p. 92), it is applied to the back of that nerve till near the tongue, and c&n be easily separated fi-om it; but beyond that point it enters amongst the fibres of the gustatorj^ nerve and is conveyed to the tongue. Near the submaxillar}^ gland an offset is sent to the submaxillary ganglion. * Deep view of the submaxillary region (Illustrations of Dissections) Muscles: a. Genio-hyo-glossus. b. Genio-hyoideus. c.

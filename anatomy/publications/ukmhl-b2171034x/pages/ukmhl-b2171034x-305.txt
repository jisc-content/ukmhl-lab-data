289 ANTERIOR INTEROSSEOUS VESSELS. the pronator quadratus. At that spot the artery turns from the front to the back of the hmb, and descends to the back of the carpus, where it ends by anastomosing with the posterior interosseous and carpal arteries. Branches. Numerous offsets are given to the contiguous muscles. Muscular One long branch (/), median, accompanies the median nerve, supplying it, and either ends in the flexor sublimis, or extends beneath the annular ligament to the palmar arch. About the middle of the forearm two nutrient vessels of the nutrient to radius and ulna arise from the artery. "ViTiere it is about to pass through the interosseous membrane and the it furnishes twigs to the pronator quadratus ; and one branch is continued beneath that muscle to anastomose with the anterior carpal arteries. The anterior interosseous nerve is derived from the median (fig. Anterior • 81,"), and accompanies the artery of the same name to the pronator jrervTendr* quadratus muscle, the under surface of which it enters. Some " P^u'itor. lateral branches are distributed by it to the deep flexor muscles. Dissection. The attachment of the biceps and brachialis anticus to Dissection, the bones of the forearm may be now cleaned and examined. The insertion of the brachialis anticus takes place by a broad insertion of thick tendon, about an inch in length, which is fixed into the coro- antic^uf^ noid process of the ulna, except at the inner edge; and into the contiguous rough part of the bone. Insertion of the biceps. The tendon of the biceps is inserted into insertion of the mner^ part of the tubercle of the radius, and slightly into the bone behind it. A bursa intervenes between it and the front of the tubercle. At its attachment the anterior surface becomes ex- ternal ; and the opposite. The supinator brevis muscle partly sur- rounds the insertion. Sbctioit V.

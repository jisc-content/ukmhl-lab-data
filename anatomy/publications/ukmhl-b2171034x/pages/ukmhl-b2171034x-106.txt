DISSECTION OF THE TTERYGOID REGIOX. 90 MuRculftr piece Dh-ections. Should the internal maxillary arteiy obstruct the view o± the nerve, it may be cut through. The SMALLER PART, formed mainly by its contribution from the trunk of the nei-ve, receives nearly all the fibrils of the motor root and ends in branches for the muscles of the jaw, viz. temporal masseter, and one pterygoid ; and for the muscle of the cheek, the buccmator. t''^' ^'-""^^^^^ furnished to the under surface of the temporal muscle. Like the arteries, they are two in number, Fig. 21.* posterior -and ■anterior. Masseteric. Articular. anterior and posterior, and course upwards beneath the external pterygoid muscle. The posterior hranch is the smallest, and is often derived from the masseteric nerve ; it is placed near the back of the temporal fossa. The anterior hranch supplies the greater part of the muscle, and communicates sometimes with the buccal nerve. The masseteric hranch (-) takes a backward course above the external pterj-goid muscle, and through the sigmoid notch, to the under surface of the masseter muscle : in the masseter the nerve can be followed to near the anterior border. As this branch passes by the articulation of the jaw it gives one or more twigs to that joint. * Deep view of the pterygoid region (Illustrations of Dissections). Muscles : A. Temporal reflected, b. Condyle of the jaw disai-ticulated, with the external pterygoid attached to it. c. Internal pterygoid, d. Buccinator. F. jMasseter thrown down. Nerves: 1. Buccal. 2. Masseteric, cut. 3. Deep temporal. 4. Auriculo-temporal. 6. Chorda tympani. 7. Inferior dental. 8. Gusta- tory. 10. Internal lateral ligament of the lower jaw. The arteries are not figured, with the exception of the internal maxillary trunk which is marked with 9 : the offsets of the artery accompany the nerves, being named like them. 4

409 NERVE EOOTS AND GANGLION. the dura mater, and enter the two points of the intervertebral ganglion. Tlie intervertebral ganglion (fig. 123). Each posterior root is pro- vided with a ganglion (c). The ganglia are reddish in colour, and "^^.^^^ oval in shape whilst they are surrounded by the dura mater ; and (,o„st^.^g. their size is proportioned to that of the root. By means of the tion. previous dissection, the ganglion may be seen to be bifid at the Each is inner end (fig. 123 u), where it is joined by the bundles of fibrils ' ^" of the root (i) ; it might be said to possess two small ganglia, one for each bmidle of fibrils, which are blended at their outer ends. Sometimes the first or suboccipital nerve is without a ganglion. The anterior or aganglionic roots (fig. 123 a) arise from the side Anterior of the spinal cord by filaments which are attached irregularly—not ^^thout in a straight line, and approach near the middle fissure at the lower ganglion, end of the cord. Taking the same direction as the posterior root to the inter- pierces vertebral foramen, the fibrils enter a distinct opening in, and have a,\'J'^j"i,'Js^^" a separate sheath of the dura mater. In their further course to the posterior trunk of the nerve they are gathered into two bundles (fig. 123, B, a), ganglion?"'* and pass over the ganglion without joining it. Finally the anterior root blends with the posterior beyond the ganglion, to form the trunk. Characters of the roots. Besides variations in the relative size of of'roots^'^* the two roots, the following characters are to be noted :— Union of the fibrils. The fibrils of contiguous anterior roots may Some sets be intermingled, and the fibrils of the neighbouring posterior roots j'oi"!^"^^ may be connected in a like manner ; but the anterior is never mixed with the posterior root. Size of the roots to each other. The posterior root is larger than Posterior the anterior, except m the suboccipital nerve ; and the number of '^i^sest, the fibrils is also greater. Further, the posterior is proportionally proportion- larger in the cervical than in any other group ; in the dorsal nerves nick^'^''*' there is but a very slight diiEerence in favour of the hinder root. Size of both roots along the cord. Both roots are larger where the Roots in- nerves for the limbs arise, than at any other part of the cord ; and ao'^'' ''^"''^ they are greater in the nerves to the lower than in those to the upper limbs. They are smallest at the lower extremity of the cord. Direction and length of the roots. As the apertures of transmission Oblique in from the spinal canal are not opposite the place of origin of the nerves, the roots must be directed more or less obliquely. This obliquity increases from above down ; for in the upper cei-^ncal nerves the roots are horizontal, but in the lumbar and sacral nerves Most so they have a veriiical direction around the end of the medulla spinalis. '"^"^^''^J'' The appearance of the long fibrils around the end of the cord (fig. 124) resembles the extremity of a horse's tail, and bears appro- and form priately the term cauda equina.- cautla The length of the roots increases in proportion to their obliquity Between the origin and the intervertebral foramen for the lowest cer- incrfases vical nerve the increase amounts to the depth of one vertebra ; in the ^.^^ ^bo lowest dorsal nerve it equals the depth of two vertebraj ; and in the ^lown.

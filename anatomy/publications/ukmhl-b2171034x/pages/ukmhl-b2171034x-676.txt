The inner edge (b, pubio-femoral band) is attached superiorly to the prominent pubic portion of the hip bone inside the acetabulum, and inferiorly to a roughened surface at the lower part of the neck of the femur on a level Avith, and in front of the small trochanter : this band controls the abductory movement of the joint. At the back of the capsule close to the neck of the femur is a band of transverse fibres (fig. 203, b), about as wide as the little finger, which arches like a collar over the neck of the bone. By its lower edge it is united to the cervix femoris by a thin layer (c) of fibrous tissue and syno"\aal membrane ; at the upper edge it is joined by the longitudinal capsular fibres (a). It gives insertion to the longitudinal fibres of the capsule, and prevents that restriction * Fore part of the capsule of the hip-joint, a, Ilio-femoral ligament, b. Pubio-femoral edge or band. c.

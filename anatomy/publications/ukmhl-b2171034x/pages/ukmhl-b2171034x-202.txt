186 DISSECTION OF THE BRAIN. Origin from cerubruiu. Tiiict of the nerve. The orirjln of the nen^e will be afterwards seen to come from the optic thalamus and the corpora geniculata, and from one of the corpora quadrigemina (nates). The tract is the flattened part of the optic winding round the peduncle of the cerebrum. In front it ends in the commissure, and behmd It splits mto two pieces by which it is fixed to the brain As the tract reaches forwards it crosses the crus cerebri, to which It is attached by its outer or anterior edge ; and in fi-ont of the Kg. 63.* crus it is placed between the substantia perforata antica on the outside, and the tuber cinereum on the uiside, but whether it receives filaments fi-om the latter is uncertain. Its coniinis- The commissure (chiasma) of the neiwes measures half an inch sure: across, and lies on the olivary eminence of the sphenoid bone, situation, within the cii-cle of Willis. It is placed in front of the tuber cinereum ; and passing beneath it (in this position of the brain) is the thin lamina cinerea. arrangemeut In the commissure each tract is resolved into three sets of fibres with the following arrangement:â€”The outer fibres, few in number, are continued straight to the eyeball of the same side.

615 COURSE J^T) COVERINGS OF HERNIA. Anterior to the canal, are Poupart's ligament and tte ^P-^r end parts^^^^ of the falciform margin of the saphenous openmg ; whilst behind it is the pectineus muscle, covered by fascia lata. On the outer side of the canal, but in the sheath, is the femoral vem._ Through this channel the intestine passes from the abdomen m femoral The'crumZ nngO is the upper opening of the crural canal It is Cmna^ring on a level with the base of Gimbernat's ligament (fig. 140, and ^^^^^^ is larger in the female than in the male. Oval in shape, its greatest measurement is from side to side, in which direction it equals about half an inch ; and it is filled by a lymphatic gland. The structures around the ling, outside the crural sheath, are similar to those bounding the canal, viz. in fi-ont the superficial and the deep crural arch, and behind, the pubes covered by the pectineus muscle and the fascia lata. Internally is Gimbernat's ligament with the conjoined tendon ; and externally (but within the sheath) is the femoral vein. The position of vessels on the several sides of the ring is stated at page 464. Septum crurale. That part of the subperitoneal fatty layer which ^^l^.^ is placed over the opening of the crural ring, has been named crural septum fi'om its position between the thigh and abdomen position; (Cloquet). The situation of the septum is now visible, but its bow formed, characters are ascertained in the dissection of the abdomen (p. 463). Femoral Hernia. In this kind of hernia there is a protrusion of Fe^n?rai intestine mto the thigh beneath Poupart's ligament. And the gut ^g^j^^^j^ descends in the crural sheath, bemg placed on the inner side of the vein. Course. At first the intestine takes a vertical direction in its pro- Course; gress from the abdomen, and passes through the crm-al ring, and flrst_^^^ along the crural canal as far as the saphenous opening. At this ' spot it changes its course, and is du-ected fomards to the surface next of the thigh, where it becomes elongated transversely ; and should anTtben the gut protrude still farther, the tumour ascends on the abdomen, upwards, in consequence of the resistance being less in this direction than on the front of the thigh. The winding course of the hernia may suggest to the dissector How it is the direction in which attempts should be made to replace the in- ^ack.''"^^^^'^ testine in the abdominal cavity. With the view of malting the bowel retrace its course, it will be necessary if the protrusion is small to direct it backwards and upwards ; but if the hernia is large it must be pressed down first to the saphenous opening, and after- wards backwards and upwards towards the crural canal and ring. During the manipulation to return the intestine to its cavity the . thigh is to be raised and rotated inwards, in order that the margin of the saphenous opening and the other structures may be relaxed. Coverings. As the intestine protrudes it is clothed by the follow- Coverings from peri- toueum, Gimbemat used the name crural ring, and Mr. Lawrence proposes to call it femoral aperture. Might not the nomenclature be made to resemble more that used in describing inguinal hernia, by calling this opening the internal crural aperture, and the saphenous opening the external crural aperture ?

Its arch reaches liigher on the right than the left side Fig. 168.* (p. 327), and is constantly vaiying during life in respiration. In forced expiration the muscle ascends, and reaches as high as the upper border of the right fourth rib at the sternum, and the upper edge of the lifth rib on the left side, close to the sternum. In forced inspiration it descends, and its slope would be represented by a line drawn from the middle of the ensifonn cartilage to the eleventh rib. Action. As the muscle moves up and down during respiration, it is depressed by the contraction of the fleshy fibres which are attached to the ribs and spine ; and it is raised during their relaxation. When the diaphragm descends it changes its shape. The central tendon, which moves but slightly, remains the highest point of the arch, whilst the sides which contract freely are sloped from the tendon to the wall of the thorax. During the ascent the midriff retains nearly the same form as in a state of rest, for the tendon is Height ill forced expiration and inspi- ration. Use in respiration.

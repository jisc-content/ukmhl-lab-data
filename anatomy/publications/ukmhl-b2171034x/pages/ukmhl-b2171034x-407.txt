Perhaps the muscle of one side may tend to mclme the spine laterally. . ^ +i „ Erector ° The ERECTOR SPiNiE is the muscular mass on the side oi spine in the lumbar region. It is single and pointed below ; and sigatits its cutaneous surface is covered near the sacrum by a wide and strong tendon, which is common to it and the multifidus spmaj. The muscle arises at the pelvis from the posterior fifth of the crest of the hip-bone at tlie inner aspect, except opposite the upper spmous process : in the lumbar region it is attached by fleshy and tendin- ous pieces to the transverse processes, to the tubercle (process, accessorius) at the root, and to the layer of the fascia lumborum external to eacli. Opposite the last rib it divides into iUo-costalis JJ™^*^ and longissimus dorsi. ^- The iLio-cosTALis (sACRO-LUMBALis) is the smallest of the two ^a^™-^ pieces resulting fi-om the di^^sion of the erector spinte. Its fibres end in six or seven flat tendons, which are connected together by their margins, and are inserted into the angles of as many of the lower ribs. The muscle is continued onwards to the other ribs and the neck by a fleshy part, which constitutes the two under- lower ribs, mentioned muscles :— ^ The musculus accessorius ad sacro-lumbalem begins by a series ^'i^°"^"f„. of tendinous and fleshy bundles on the angles of the lower six ribs, internal to the insertion of the ilio-costalis ; and it ends in tendons, which are inserted into the remaining ribs (upper six), in a line with js attached ^ , n ji XO six TippGl* the iUo-costalis, and into the posterior transverse process or the ribs, seventh cervical vertebra. The cervicalis ascendens is a muscular slip prolonging the ^^^^^^^^^1 accessorius into the neck : this muscle is attached to fom- ribs (third, fourth, fifth, and sixth), and is inserted into the posterior reaches tlie transverse processes of three cervical vertebra3. Adz., sixth, fifth, and fourth. * The LONGISSIMUS DORSI gradually decreases in size as it ascends ^°°°iojsj along the thorax. Internally the muscle is inserted into the trans- verse processes of all the dorsal vertebras by a series of tendinous insertion: and fleshy bundles ; and externally it is attached to the ribs, except the first two or three, by tlun fleshy processes between the tubercle and angle. Its muscular prolongation to the neck is is continued united with tlie upper fleshy fibres, and splits into the two foUow- t^e^^*^^ ing pieces :— The transversalis colli (fig. 118, ^) arises ixom. the ti-ansverse pro- transver- cesses of the upper six jiorsal vertebras, and is inserted into the ''"^ Lf. posterior transverse processes of the cervical vertebras, except the first two and the last. 1 - 4 • The trachelo-mastoid muscle (fig. 118, ^ transversalis capitis ?) and to head arises in common with the preceding, and is attached, besides, by mastokl!'''^" distinct tendons to the articular processes of the last three or four cervical vertebrse. The muscle is thin and is inserted beneath the

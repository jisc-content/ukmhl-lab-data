174 DISSECTION OF THE NECK. I Botweon skull nntl axis is a Mride layer, to be removed except in the first three, tlic arches of these vertebrjc are to be sawn through close to the articular processes. Nextly the ring of the occipital bone bounding posteriorly tlie foramen mag- num is to be taken away. Lastly, the student should detach the tube of dura mater from the interior of the spinal canal; and, on raising from below the upper end of the posterior common ligament of the bodies of the vertebrfB, the ligamentous band between the occipital bone and the axis (occipito-axoid) will come into view. Union of the occipital hone loiih the axis. The central ligament (occipito-axoidean) (fig. 48, is a strong layer beneath the pos- terior common ligament of the bodies of the vertebrje, and is rather triangulai- in form with the base uppermost. Above it is attached to the basilar process (on the cranial aspect) near the margin of the foramen magTium, extending as far on each side as the insertion of the check ligaments. From that spot it descends over the odontoid process, and, becoming narrower, is inserted into the body of the axis. Occasionally a bursa is found between it â€¢ and the transverse ligament of the atlas. Dissection Dissection (fig. 49). After the removal of the occipito-axoidean Sgament'^^ ligament, by cutting transversely through it above, and reflecting it, the student should define a strong band, the transverse ligament, Fig. 49.* Two lateral or check ligaments. which crosses the root of the odontoid process, and sends upwards and downwards a slip to the occipital bone and the axis. The upper ofEset fi'om the transverse ligament may be cut through afterwards for the purpose of seeing the check hgaments which diverge one on each side, from the odontoid process. The lateral odontoid or check ligaments (fig. 49, ') are two sti'ong bundles of fibres, attached by one end to the side of the head of the odontoid process, and by the other to a depression on the mner surface of the condyle of the occipital bone. These hgaments are covered by the occipito-axoidean band ; their upper fibres are short and almost horizontal, and the lower are longer and oblique. * Internal ligaments between tlie occipital bone and the atlas and axis (Bourgeryr 1- The left check ligament. 2.

241 BOUNDARIES OF AXILLA. which arc constructed by the muscles passing from tlie trunk to the upper limb. In the anterior fold are the two pectoral muscles Tl>e pecton.1 but these take unequal shares in its construction, m consequence ot f^out, the difference in their size and shape :â€”thus the pectorahs major A extends over the whole fi-ont of the space, reaching fi-om the clavicle to the lower edge of the anterior fold ; whilst the pectorahs minor B, which is a narrow muscle, corresponds only with the middle third of the depth. In the posterior boundary, from above Fig. 69.* downwards, lie the subscapularis f, the latissimus dorsi muscle D, and the teres major E : this boundary reaches farther out than the and latissi- anterior, especially near the humerus ; and its free margin which gubsca- is formed by the latissimus dorsi, projects forwards beyond the puiaris be- level of the subscapularis. On the inner side of the axilla lie the first four ribs, with their on the intervening intercostal muscles, and the part of the serratus magnus ^'^'^ c taking origin fi-om those bones. On the outer side the space has outer sides. * View of the dissected axilla (Illustrations of Dissections.) Muscles : a. Pectoralis major, b. Pectoralis minor, c. Serratus magnus. D.

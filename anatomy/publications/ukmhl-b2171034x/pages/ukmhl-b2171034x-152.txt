136 DISSECTION OF THE NASAL CAVITY. Lower moiitiis. to on the outer wall. Anterior]}' it communicates by a funnel-shaped passage (infundibulum) with the frontal sinus and the anterior eth- moidal cells ; and near its middle is a small aperture, which leads into the hollow of the upper jaw. The inferior meatus (fig. 31,") is sti-aighter than the middle one, and rather exceeds the width of the limited space on the outer wall ; Fig. 31.* and when the bone is clothed by the mucous membrane it extends still farther foi-wards. In its front is the opening of the ductus ad nasum. meatus Occasionally there is a small fourth or rudimentary meatus above the rest (fig. 31, which communicates with a posterior ethmoidal cell. Nares. The nares. In the recent condition of the nose each fossa has a distinct anterior opening in the face, and another in the pharynx ; but in the skeleton there is only one common openmg in fi-ont for both sides. These apertures and the boundaries, have been before described (pp. 30 and 126). Mucous The mucous lining of the nasal fossa is called the pituitarj^ or nosef Â°^ ^^^^ Scluieiderian membrane ; and from its blending with the periosteum it acquires much strength. It is continuous Avith the integument at the nostril, and with the membrane lining the pharynx tlu-ough the posterior opening : moreover, it is also continuous with the mucous membrane of the eyeball, and with that of the different sinuses, viz., frontal, ethmoidal, sphenoidal, and maxillary.

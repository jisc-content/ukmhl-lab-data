117 ENDING OF THORACIC DUCT. Tlie LEFT SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY arises from tlie arch of tlie aorta, L^oft^^^^ instead of from an innominate trunk, and ascenda thence over the ^^^^^ iirst rib in its course to the upper limb. With this difference on tlie ai„ers jn.ich two sides in the origin of the subclavian,—the one vessel begmnmg 1^°^'^^^^!^^ opposite tlie sterno-claviculai- articulation, the other m the thorax, it is evident that the length and connections of the part of the artery on the inner side of the scalenus must vary much on opposite sides* First part. The part of the artery internal to the anterior scalenus ii^ttie first is much longer on the left than the right side, and is almost vertical ^'^ in dii-ection, instead of being horizontal like its fellow. After leaving the chest it is deeply placed in the neck, near the spine and the oesophagus, and does not rise usually so high above the first rib as the right subclavian. Between the arteiy and the surface are structures like those on Connections the right side, viz. the common teguments with the platysma and rounding deep fascia, and the sterno-mastoid, hyoid, and thyroid muscles. V!<-rts. Behind the vessel is the longus colli muscle. To the inner side are the oesophagus and the thoracic duct ; and the pleura is in contact with the outer and anterior surfaces. Its connections lower in the chest are described in the dissection of the thorax. Veins. The internal jugular vein is superficial to the arteiy and Veins, parallel to it. Nerves. The pneumo-gastric nerve lies parallel to the vessel instead Position of of across it as on the right side ; and the phrenic nerve crosses over it close to the scalenus. Accompanying the artery are the cardiac branches of the sympathetic, which course along its inner side to the chest; and beneath it is the inferior cei-vical ganglion. The second and third parts of the artery, viz. beneath and beyond Best of the scalenus, are nearly the same as on the right side (p. 68) ; but the student must note for himseK the slight variations that may exist in the connections. The branches of this arteiy resemble so closely those of the right Brandies trunk, that one description will serve for both (p. 69 to 71). It tSof^ may be remarked, that the superior intercostal of the left side is rigUt vessel, usually internal to, instead of beneath the scalenus as on the right side; in other words, this branch arises sooner. The thoracic duct (fig. 27, *) conveys the chyle and lymph of the Thoracic greater part of the body into the venous circulation. Escai^ing from ^^'^^ the thorax on the oesophagus, the duct ascends in the neck as high tii™tho^ax" as the seventh or sixth cervical vertebra. At the spot mentioned it issues from beneath the carotid trunk, and arches outwards above or over the subclavian artery, and in front of the scalenus muscle and joins and the phrenic nerve, to open into the subclavian close to the union ygj^j''^'^^**" with the internal jugular vein. Double valves, like those of the valves, veins, are present in the interior of the tube ; and a pair guards the opening into the posterior part of the vein, to prevent the passage of the blood into it. Frequently the upper part of the duct is di-sdded ; and there may be separate openings into the large vein, coiTespond- ing with those divisions.

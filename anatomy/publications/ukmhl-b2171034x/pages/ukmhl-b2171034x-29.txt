SINUSES OF CRANIUM. la of which it gives a small slip. In it is contained the occipital ^-^jg^", sinus. The SINUSES are venous spaces between the ayers of the dura Snu^en of mater, into which blood is received. AH the smuses open eithe into a large space named torcular Hcrophili, opposite the occipital protuberance; or into the two cavernous sinuses on the sides ot the hodv of the sphenoid bone. , , ^ • • -x i I The TOUCULAK HEROPHiLi (fig. 3, «) is placed in the tentonum, o.o,p.tai opposite the centre of the occipital bone. It is of an n-regular Fig, 3.* shape, and numerous sinuses open into it, viz., the superior longi- tudinal above, and the occipital below ; the straight in fi-ont, and the lateral sinus on each side. The superior lonqitudinal sinus has been already described (see Superior p. 10). The inferior longitudinal sinus (fig. 3, c) resembles a small vein, inferior lon~ and is contained in the lower border of the f alx cerebri at the ^ °* posterior part. This vein receives blood from the falx and the larger brain, and ends in the straight sinus {d) at the edge of the tentorium. The straiqlit sinus (fig. 3, cl) lies along the middle of the ten- Straight ' . sinus torium, and seems to continue the preceding sinus to the common point of union. Its form is triangular, like the superior longi- tudinal. Joining it are the inferior longitudinal sinus, the veins of Galen from the interior of the large brain, and some small veins from the upper surface of the cerebellum. The occipital sinus (fig. 3, g) is a small space in the falx cere- Occipital belli, which reaches to the foramen magnum, and collects the blood from the occipital fossas. This sinus may be double.

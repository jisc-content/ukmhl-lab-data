249 BRACHIAL TLEXUS. be cut across below the second rib,** hid toj be drawn down with hooks; and their thoracic branches may be removed at the same time. A dense fascia is to be cleared away from the large nerves of the plexus. The BRACHIAL PLEXUS results from the union of the anterior Nerves ^ branches of the four lower cervical nei-ves 'with part of the first ^"^JJJ^f dorsal ; and a slip is added to it above, from the lowest nei-ve in rlexus. the cervical plexus. It is placed successively in the neck and the its situatioi^ axilla, and is divided opposite the coracoid process into large trunks for the supply of the limb. The part of the plexus above the clavicle is described in the dissection of the head and neck (p. 72). The part below the cla\'icle has the same connections with the ^.Q^^g'^''""^'^" surrounding muscles as the axillary artery. The nerve trunks interlace in it generally in the following manner :— At first the plexus consists of two bundles of nerves, which lie J''" 'V^,"'®:^ ^ • 1 1 form three on the outer side of the arteiy, and are thus constituted ;—the one cords nearest the vessel is formed by the last cervical''with a piece of the first dorsal nerve ; and the other, by the fifth, sixth, and seventh cer\'ical nerves. A little lower down a third or posterior cord is produced by the union of two fasciculi, one fi'orn each of the other bundles ; so that, beneath the small pectoral muscle, the plexus con- ^''^ sists of three large cords, one being on the outer side, another in- ternal to, and the third behind the vessel. Occasionally there may be some deviation from the above-mentioned arrangement. The branches of the plexus below the clavicle arise fi-om the '^'"'^=■.^1^ several cords in the following way :— viz., ' The outer card gives origin to one anterior thoraqic branch, the from the musculo-cutaneous trunk, and the outer head of the median nerve. The inner cord produces a second anterior thoracic nerve, the inner head of the median, the internal cutaneous, the nerve of Wrisberg, and the ulnar nerve. The posterior cord fiu-nishes the subscapular branches, and ends |°rd'''^°^ in the circumflex and musculo-spiral trunks. Only the thoracic and subscapular nerves are dissected to their The foUow- termination at present ; the remaining nerves will be seen in the "jli^^'® arm. The anterior tlioracic branches (fig. 70, ' and '^), two in number, ^"^^ anterior are named outer and inner, like the cords from which they come. The outer nerve crosses inwards over the axillary artery, to the outer under surface of the great pectoral muscle in which it ends. On the inner side of the vessel it communicates with the following branch. The inner thoracic branch turns upw ards between the artery and and inner, vein, and after receiving the offset from the other, ends in many branches to the under surface of the pectoralis minor. Some twigs enter the great pectoral muscle, after passing either through the pectoralis minor or above its border. The subscapular nerves are three in number, and take their names Three sub- from the muscles supplied :— scapular: * The student must bo careful not to cut tlie vessels liiglier than the spot mentioned, otherwise he will injure the dissection of the neck.

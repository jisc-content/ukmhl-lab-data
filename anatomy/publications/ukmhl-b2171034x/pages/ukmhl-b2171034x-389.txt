The bodies of the vertebras are united ii^ebodaes by an anterior and a posterior common ligament, with an intei- ^y. vening piece of fibro-cartilage. The anterior common ligament (fig. 109, a) reaches from the atlas Antenor to the sacrum : it is widest opposite the lumbar vertebrai, and is ugament, narrowed upwards. It consists of a central Avide and thick part (a), ^ath, and of a thinner portion (&), on each side of the body of the vertebra. If the central piece be pi„ iqq* cut across at intervals it will be seen to be thickest opposite the hollow of the bodies. The fibres of the middle piece are longitudinal in direction. By detaching parts of the ligament, the superficial fibres will be seen to reach three or more vertebrae, whilst the deep extend from bone to bone. A greater number of the fibres are attached to the in- tervertebral fibro-cartilages than to the bones ; and more are fixed to the margins than the centre of the bod}''. The posterior common ligament (fig. 110), much thinner than the anterior, is contained in the spinal canal, lying on the posterior sur- face of the vertebrae, and extends from the sacrum to the occipital bone. This ligament is wide above, and diminishes in size down- wards, just the opposite of the anterior. In the neck, A, it is loose, and extends across the bodies. In the back and loins it is a narrow band, B, which sends oflE on each side a pointed process to be at- tached to the pedicle of the neural arch ; and it is wider opposite the intervertebral discs than on the bodies, so that the margins are dentate. One surface of the ligament is in contact with the dura Connec- mater; and between the band and the vertebraj are the intraspinal vessels. Its fibres are superficial and deep as in the anterior ligament, and Attach- ^ ^ & ) mentof ilbres. * Anterior common ligament of the bodies of the vortebrse. a.

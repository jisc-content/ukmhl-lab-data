Commonly they are ten or twelve in number ; but in number and size they varj' much. Small va.s- cular twigs from the branches of the axillary vessels are furnished to them. The glands by the side of the bloodvessels receive the lymph- atics of the arm ; and those along the hinder boundary are joined by the lympliatics of the fore part of the thorax and posterior sur- face of the Back, as well as by some fi-om the mamma. Most of the efferent ducts imite to form a trunk, which opens into the lym- g^d in the phatic duct of the neck of the same side ; some may enter separately |y™l**«" the subclavian vein. The PECTORALIS MAJOR, A, is triangular in shape, with the base at ^e^^tOj^^'-"* the thorax and the apex at the arm. It arises internally fi-om the """^^ front of the sternum, and the cartilages of the true ribs except the gheliunr^ last ; superiorly fi-om the sternal half of the clavicle ; and inferiorly clavicle, from the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle of the abdomen. From this wide origin the fibres take different directions,—those fi-om the clavicle being inclined obliquely downwards, and those fi-om the lower ribs upwards beneath the former; and all end in a tendon, which is inserted into the outer edge of the bicipital groove 1^^^'^^°^^ of the humerus for about two inches. humems. This muscle bounds the axilla anteriorly, and is connected some- times to its fellow by fibres in front of the sternum. Besides the superficial structures and the mamma, the platysma covers the pec- toralis major close below the clavicle. A lengthened interval, which parts cover- corresponds with a depression on the surface, separates the clavicu- lar from the sternal attachment. One border (outer) is in contact tue borders, with the deltoid muscle, and with the cephalic vein and a small artery ; and the lower border forms the margin of the anterior fold of the axilla. The parts covered by the muscle will be seen sub- sequently. Action. If the humerus is hanging, the muscle will move for- Use ou the wards the limb until the elbow reaches the fi-ont of the trunk, and '^*"8ing, will rotate it in. When the limb is raised, the pectorahs depresses and adducts it; raised, and acting -with other muscles inserted into the opposite side of the humerus, it may dislocate the head of that bone when the lower end is raised and fixed, as in a fall on the elbow. Supposing both hmbs fixed as in climbing, the trunk will be and fixed raised by both muscles ; and the ribs can be elevated in laborious breathing. Dissection (fig. 70).

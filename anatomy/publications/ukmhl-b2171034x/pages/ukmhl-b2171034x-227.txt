BOUNDS OF LATERAL VENTRICLE. 211 Tlie lower or descending portion of the ventric e winds beneath The. csoend- the optic thdamus, and forms a curve like the half-bent fore fingen The roof is forn.ed by the optic thalamus and the eont^uou part of the hemisphere. In the floor is a large curved, convex e n nence somewhat indented at the end-the hippocampus major (/) ; and along its concave margin is a thin white band-ta.ma (c ), winch is prolonged from the fornix. External to the projection of the and bod.es Fis. 63.* hippocampus is another white eminence, the eminentia collateralis (Jc), which tapers from above down. In this comu of the ventricle is the vascular fiinge of the plexus choroides. The septum lucidum (fig. G3, I), or the thin structure between the Septum lateral ventricles, is translucent, and hangs vertically in the middle 'â€¢ line along the anterior two thirds of the corpus callosum. It is position, somewhat triangular in form, with the base turned forwards, form, and the pointed extremity backwards. Its surfaces look to the surfaces, * View of the lateral ventricles : on the left side the descending cornu is laid open. (From a cast in the museum of University College, London.) a.

CUTANEOUS VEINS OF FOREARM. 277 from the front and back of the forearm, Avithout injury to the numerous superficial vessels and nerves beneath ; and it should be taken also from the back of the hand, by prolonging the ends ot the transverse cut along each margin to a little beyond the knuckles. The whole of the fore finger-should have the integument removed from it, in order that the nei-ves may be followed to the end. The superficial vessels and nerves can be now traced in the fat; Seek the^^ they have the following position, and most of them have been partly Vessels and dissected :—Along the inner side, in front of the forearm with the nei^es in ulnar veins, is the continuation of the internal cutaneous nerve ; and near the wrist there is occasionally a small offset from the ulnar nerve. On the outer side with the radial vein is the superficial part of the musculo-cutaneous nerve. Close to the hand, in the centre of the forearm, and inside the tendon of the flexor carpi radiaUs which can be rendered prominent by extending the wiist, the small palmar branch of the median nerve should be sought beneath the fat. On the ulnar artery, close inside the pisiform bone, a small palmar branch of the ulnar nerve is to be looked for. At the back of the forearm the largest external cutaneous branch Iceland, of the musculo-spiral nerve is to be traced onwards ; and ofEsets are to be followed to this surface fi-om the nerves in front. On the posterior part of the hand is an arch of superficial veins. Winding back below the uhia is the dorsal branch of the ulnar hand, nerve ; and Ijdng along the outer border of the hand is the radial nerve : these should be ti-aced to the fingers. Cutaneous Veins. The superficial veins are named median, radial, ^'^^'^^^^f;,,,. and ulnar, from their position in the limb. of the fore- Superjicial arch on the hack of the hand. This arch is more or less perfect, and receives the posterior superficial digital veins. At the ^°^^?" sides the arch terminates in the radial and ulnar veins. The radial vein begins m the outer end of the arch above men- radial; tioned, and in some small radicles at the back of the thumb. It is continued along the forearm, at first behind and then on the outer border as far as the elbow, where it gives rise to the cephalic vein by its union with the outer branch of the median vein (fig. 76, '^). The ulnar veins are anterior and posterior, and occupy the front ulnar: and back of the limb :— The anterior arises near the wrist by the junction of small roots anterior from the hand, and runs on the inner part of the forearm to the elbow ; here it unites with the inner branch of the median, and forms the basilic vein (fig. 76,'''). The posterior ulnar vein is situate on the back of the limb. It and pos- commences by the union of a branch, " vena salvatella," from the back of the httle finger, with an offset of the venous arch ; it is continued along the back of the forearm nearly to the elbow, and bends forwards to open into the anterior ulnar vein. The median vein takes origin near the wrist by small branches median, which are derived fi-om the palmar surface of the hand ; and it is directed along the centre of the forearm nearly to the elbow.

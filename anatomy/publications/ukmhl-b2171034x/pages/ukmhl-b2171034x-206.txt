The brain is to remain in the same position as for the examniation of the nerves and vessels. IMie MEDULLA OULONGATA is the dilated upper end of the spinal cord which is contained in the cranium (fig. 54). Its limit is the lower border of the pons in one direction, and the upper margin of the atlas in the other. This portion of the cord is pyramidal in Fig. 54,* Fig. 65.+ Base. Apex. Surfaces. Division into halves bj' fissm-es. Components of each half. form, and measm-es about one inch and a quarter in length; half an inch in breadth below, and about an inch at its widest pai-t. Its base joins the pons, the transverse fibres of the latter marking its limit; and its apex is blended with the spinal cord. The anterior surface is irregularly convex, and is in contact with the hollowed basilar process of the occijaital bone. The opposite sur- face is somewhat excavated superiorly, where it forms the floor of the fourth ventricle ; and it rests in the fissure between the halves of the cerebellum. On the posterior aspect there ai-e not any cross fibres of the pons, as in fi'ont, to mark the extent of the medulla. The medulla oblongata is divided into halves by a median fissure in fi'ont and behind. The fissures are in a line with those along the cord : the anterior ceases at the pons in a dilation (foramen ctecum), but the posterior is prolonged, behind the pons, into the floor of the fourth ventricle. Each half of the medulla is constituted of pieces continuous with * Anterior view of tlie medulla oblongata and pons. 1. Anterior p3nramid. 2. Lateral tract. 3. Restiform body. 5. Corpus olivarc. 6.

192 DISSECTION OF THE BRAIN. Wi"" ""^l^Z constructing bodies of one half of the medulla oblongata with those of the spinal cord. Let him trace out first the fibres of the pymnnd on the riglit side : in it two sets of fibres have to be shown—one from the same, and one from the opposite side of the cord. The fibres from the opposite half of the cord will appear in the median fissure, when the pyramids are gently drawn from one another, where they aa-e named the decussating fibres; and to lay these bare more completely, the small part of the anterior column ^ Fig. 66 * Fibres of anterior pyramid.; Derivation of the cord on the opposite side, which remains below the cross fibres (for the cord has been cut through near these), may be forcibly turned outwards. The anterior pyramid (fig. 56, a) receives fibres inferiorly from the anterior column of the cord of its own side, and fi'om the opposite half of the cord. The inner set of fibres, h, deep at their origin, become supei^ficial, and are directed upAvards close to the median fissure, joining the fibres continued fi-om the anterior column of the cord ; and as the inner fibres of each 23JTamid are derived from the opposite side, they cross each other m the median line—^forming thus the decussation of the medulla oblongata. Destination. The fibres of the pyi-amid are white and longitudinal, and are collected into a bundle of a prismatic form. Superiorly they enter the pons (fig. 56), to reach the cerebrum. Dissection.

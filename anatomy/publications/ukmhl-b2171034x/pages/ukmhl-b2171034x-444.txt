DISSECTION OF THE PERINiEUM. 428 On the left be_ detached in the following way :—On the left side tlie ejaculator unna>. is to be removed completely from the fi-ont of the ligament and the erector muscle from the crus of the penis. Next, the crus penis is to be detached from the bone ; but this must be done with care so as not to cut the triangular ligament nor to injure, near the pul)es, the terminal branches of the pudic artery and nerve to the penis. On ae right Qn the right side the dissector should trace out beneath the trans- versahs the offsets of the perinaeal nerve to the deep muscles and the urethra, with the vessels accompanying them. Fig. 131.* U^ament^of '^^^ TRIANGULAR LIGAMENT OF THE URETHRA (fig. 131, ^ periufBal urethra. aponeurosis) occupies the anterior part of the pubic arch, and supports the urethral canal. The ligament is triangular in form, with its base below ; and it is about one inch and a half in depth. Extent and Qn each side it is fixed to the pubic arch beneath the crus penis, lorm. Attach apex is connected with the symphysis pubis. Its base is turned meuts. towards the rectum, and is partly attached and partly fi'ee ;—in the middle line it is united with the central point of the perinajum ; whilst latei'ally it is fi'ee and sloped towards the bone, so that it is less deep at the centre than at the sides : connected with the lower * Deep dissection of the perinoeum (Illustrations of Dissections). ]ifnsclcs : A.

DISSECTION OF THE PELVIS. 558 Connections <>f the vt'v- tuin, viz., they arc all blended in one large piece of peritoneum that reaches from the bladder to the side and front of the pelvis. In the female the posterior ligament, containing the vessels of the bladder, is less marked than in the male. ' The RECTUM (fig. 173, is not so curved in the female as hi the male, and is generally larger. Descending along the middle of the of up niiddli'. and lower part. Uterus; sacrum and coccyx to the anus, the intestine is divided into three parts :â€” The Jirst part ends over the third piece of the sacrum, and is en- veloped by the peritoneum, except posteriorly : its connections are similar to those of the rectimi in the male, p. 552. The middle portioii reaches to the tip of the coccyx, and has the vagina above and in contact with it. The peritoneum extends on the front for a short distance. The loioer piece curves to the anus away from the vagina so as to leaA'^e between the two a space which coiTesponds, on the surface of the body, with the perinasum between the anus and the vulva. The levatores ani are on the sides, and unite below it, and the sphincter muscles surround the extremity. The UTERUS (fig. 173, ^) is somewhat conical in shape, and flattened * Side view of tlie female pelvis. (Illustrations of Dissections.) Muscles and Viscera: a, Pyriformis muscle, cut. b.

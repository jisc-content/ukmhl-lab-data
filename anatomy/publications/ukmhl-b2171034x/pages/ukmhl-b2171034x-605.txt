589 ANATOMY OF UTERUS. Interior of the utems (fig. 185). Within the uterus is a small space i which is divided artificially into two-that of the body, and that mtenor of the neck. ..... i The space occupying the body of the viscus (c) is tnangular in i^^^^^ form and is larger than the other. Its base is at the fundus, where ^ {^^^^,^ it is convex towards the cavity, and the angles are prolonged to- wards the Fallopian tubes. The apex is directed downwards, and „,j,icu is joins the ca^nty in the cervix by a naiTOwed circular part, isthvius, 'janowed wliich may be nan-ower than the opening of the uterus into the vagina. The space within the neck {d) terminates inferiorly at the os ^nd a uteri, and is continuous above with the cavity within the body, s^die- It is larger at the middle than at either end, being spindle-shaped, space in ° the neck. Fig. 185.* and is somewhat flattened like the cavity of the body. Along both the anterior and the posterior wall is a longitudinal ridge ; and other ridges (ragce) are directed obhquely from these on each side : ^j^^ ^^^^ this appearance has been named arhor vitce utennits. In the intervals are ridges of between the rugte are mucous follicles, which sometimes become v^'!'^"'^ distended with fluid, and give rise to rounded clear sacs. Structure. The dense wall of the uterus is composed of laj^ers uterus is a of unstriated muscular fibre, intermixed with areolar and elastic muscular tissues, and large bloodvessels. On the exterior is the peritoneum ; and lining the interior is a thin mucous membrane. The muscular fibres can be demonstrated at the full period of C I • 1 11 c 1 There are gestation to form three strata m the wall of the uterus, viz., ex- thiee strata: ternal, internal, and middle :— The external layer contains fibres which are mostly transverse ; external but at the fundus and sides they are oblique, and are more marked than along the middle of the organ. At the sides the fibres con- verge towards the broad ligament; some are inserted into the sub- * Interior of the uterus, with a posterior view of the broad ligaraent and the uterine appendages, a.

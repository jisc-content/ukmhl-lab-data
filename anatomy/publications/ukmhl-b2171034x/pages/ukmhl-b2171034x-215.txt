CRUEA OF CEEEBRUM. 199 the inner margin. In the natural position the two pedundes fill the opening in the tentorium cerebelli. Each is about thiee- quarters of an inch long, and widens as it approaches the cerebrum. Crossing its outer surface is tlie optic tract; and between the crura of opposite sides is the interpeduncular space, whicli contams the locus porforatus, the corpora albicantia, and the tuber cmereum.

Fig. 59.* Dissection. For the purpose of showing the structure of the crus. Dissection, on the right side (fig. 57), the optic tract should be divided, and the fibres continuous with the anterior pyramid of the medulla oblongata should be raised as far into the cms as the optic thalamus.

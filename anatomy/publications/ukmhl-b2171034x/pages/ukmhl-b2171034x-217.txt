201 PARTS AT THE BASE. and consists of two lobes, anterior and posterior. Tlie antenor is the largest, and is hollowed out behind, where it receives the round posterior lobe. In the adult this body is solid, and firm in texture ; but in the fetus it is hollow, and opens intg the tliird A'entncle through the iiifundibulum. Structure. It is firm a)id reddish externally, but softer and rather bti-u'=t«e. yellow internally. In it are nucleated cells, mixed with a granular semi-fluid material ; and the whole is contained in roundish spaces, which are constructed by a stroma of areolar tissue with blood- vessels. Dissection. To see the lamina cinerea and the anterior termination Dissection, of the corpus callosum, the hemispheres are to be gently separated fi-om each other in front. The lamina cinerea (m) is a thin concave layer of gray substance, ^^J,^^ wliich gradually tapers forwards from the tuber ciiiereum to the anterior termination of the corpus callosum. This stratum closes the anterior part of the third ventricl^, and is continuous laterally with the anterior perforated spot. In consequence of its great thin- ness, this structure is often broken tkrough in removing the brain. The cor2}us callosum bent in front, is continued horizontal^ g°iu]"um backwards in the longitudinal fissure to the lamina cinerea, and ends by two white narrow bands, the fillets or peduncles of the corpus callosum: each band is continued onwards by the side of the lamina cinerea to the anterior perforated spot. To the anterior fyj^Jy,.jy"j^ bend of the corj)us callosum the term Imee (genu) is applied, and two bands, to the prolonged central part the appellation rostrum has been given. Laterally the corpus callosum reaches into the frontal lobe, and lorms part or the floor of the lateral ventricle. spiiere. Antenor peiforated spot (substantia perforata antica, I) is a space Substantia near the inner end of the fissure of Sylvius, which is situate between autfca?*"^ the fr-ontal and temporo-sphenoidal lobes of the cerebrum, and ex- ternal to the optic tract. On the inner side it is continuous with the lamina cinerea ; and crossing it, from witliin outwards, is the fillet of the corpus callosum. Tliis space is gray on the surface ; it corresponds with the corpus striatum in the interior of the brain, and is perforated by numerous vessels for that body. Position of the part. Now the base of the cerebrum has been 1^1*^;'^"^" dissected, the brain should be turned over for the examination of the exkmiue upper part. Something should then be placed beneath the fr-ont, in ^ra^'Part. order tliat it may be raised to the same level as the back ; and a rolled-up cloth should loosely encircle the whole, to support the hemispheres. Upper Suufack of the Cerebrum. On the upper surface the Cerebnuu cerebrum, taken as a whole, is oval in form, and is convex in its abovrilmi outhne, in accordance with the shape of the skull. A median longitudinal fissure divides the cerebrum incompletely '^'^'i'led into mto two halves. At the front and back the hemispheres arc quite separated by it; but at the middle and under parts they are united by connecting pieces, the largest of which is the white corpus callosum. In it the falx cerebri is lodged.

41 OPHTHALMIC NERVE. tl.e name supra-orhital it ascends on the forehead, and supplies the external part of tlie head (p. G). ^ ^ ,.u ' Whilst in the notch the nerve gives palpelral filaments to the v^^^ ''^'^Ctpm-trochlear hranch (') passes inwards a^bove the pulley B^nch of the upi)er oblique nnisclo, and leaves the orbit to end m the p^uiey: eyeli.l and forehead (p. 7). Before the nerve turns round the Fig. 10.* margin of the frontal hone, it sends downwards a branch of com- nnmication to the infra-trochlear branch of the nasal nerve. Fre- quently there arc two supra-troclilear branches ; in such instances one arises near the back of the orbit. The lachrymal nerve (fig. 10, ^) after entering the orbit in a separate tube of the dura mater, is directed forwards in the outer part of the cavity, and beneath the lachrymal gland to the upper l yelid, where it pierces tlie palpebral ligament, and is distributed to the stractures of the lid.

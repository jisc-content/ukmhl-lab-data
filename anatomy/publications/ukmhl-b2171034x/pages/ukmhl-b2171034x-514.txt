In the glandular apparatus of the small intestine are included the crypts of Lieberkiilm, solitary glands, and Peyer's and Brnnner's glands. The crypts of Lieherh'dlin (fig. 152, a) are minute simple tubes, similar to those in the stomach, though not so closely aggregated, which exist throughout the small intestine. Thej'' open on the surface of the mucous membrane by small orifices between the villi, and around the larger glands ; they are closed at the opposite end, where they project into the submucous layer, and are seldom branched. Their length is from y\fth to -g^th of an inch ; they are filled with a translucent fluid containing granules, and are lined by a columnar epithelium. The so-called solitarij glands (fig. 151, ^) are roundish white eminences, about the size of mustard seed if distended, which are scattered along the small intestine, but in greatest number in the * A.

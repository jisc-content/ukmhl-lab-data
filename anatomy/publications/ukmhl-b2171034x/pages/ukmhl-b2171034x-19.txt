OCCIPITO-FRONTALIS MUSCLE. The anterior ov frontal part (') is a tliin muscular layer over the Fro..tai OS frontis, which is said to take its origin below. Along the line of the eyebrow the fibres are blended with the following muscles, orbicularis palpebrarum, corrugator supercilii, and pyramidalis nasi ; and they are also fixed to the subjacent bone, viz., to the os nasi Fig. 1.* internally, and to the outer angular process of the frontal bone externally (Theile). From these attachments the fibres are directed upwards to the aponeurosis, and end in it rather below the level of Ending. the coronal suture. Tlie posterior or occipital part ('') is stronger than the anterior ; Ocnipital it arises from the outer half or two thirds of the upper cui-ved line of the occipital bone, and from the mastoid portion of the temporal bone. The fibres are about one inch and a half in length, and how 1 , â€¢ attached, ascend to the aponeurosis. The tendon, or epicranial aponeurosis, extends over the upper part Aponeu- of the cranium, and is continuous across the middle line with the like structure of the opposite half of the head. On tlie side it its attach- gives origin to the auricular muscles ; and a thin membrane is here prolonged from it, over the fascia covering the temporal muscle, to be fixed to the side of the head. Posteriorly, the aponeurosis is attached to the superior curved ridge of the occipital bone between the fleshy parts of the muscles of opposite sides. The aponeurotic expansion is closely united to the skin ; but it is connected to the ment, * Extrinsic muscles of the car. 15, Attollens aurem, 16, Attrabeiis aurem. 17, Retrahens aurem only partly seen.

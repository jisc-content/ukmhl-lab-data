415 INTRASriJS^AL VESSELS. The middle set enter the substance of the crescent, and are lost in it and the cells of the intermediate tract. The posterior root (j) pierces chiefly the posterior column of the cord, and enters the posterior cornu of the crescent : hut a few fibres penetrate by the lateral fissure. It terminates in two bundles of fibres. One bundle courses round the outer side of the vesicular column, some fibres enclosing-, and others entering it ; and a few fibrils escape into the posterior column of the cord, becoming longitudinal. The second bundle is prolonged into the crescent and the inter- mediate tract, as well as into the transverse commissure behind the central canal of the cord. Intraspinal Vessels (fig. 127). Arteries supply the cord and its and the crescent. Posterior root joins vesi- cular and posterior column, gray com- missure, and crescent. Vessels of Fig. 128.+ membranes, and the bodies of the vertebrje. The veins form a re- markable plexus within the canal, but tliis will not be seen unless the vems have been specially injected. The intraspinal arteries (a) are derived from the vessels along the sides and front of the spinal column, viz. from the vertebral and ascending cervical in the neck, from the intercostal in the Back and from the lumbar and lateral sacral below. They are distributed atter the following plan :— As each artery_ enters the spinal canal by the intervertebral fora- men, It divides into two branches, upper and lower.

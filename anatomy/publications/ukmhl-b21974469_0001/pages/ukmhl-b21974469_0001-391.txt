Ruysch, relating a case in which this adhesion had taken place from inflammation, only particularizes amongst the symptoms, intolerable pain in the anterior part of the chest, and continued fever. Difficulty of breathing and palpitation have sometimes been induced not only by exertion of the body, but also by mental emotions.

It degenerated into an abscess, and carried him off. He never made any complaint of the thorax, nor of any difficulty of respiration. There was no inequality of the pulse, nor was it frequent or slow; but its strokes were feeble and slender. Dissection.

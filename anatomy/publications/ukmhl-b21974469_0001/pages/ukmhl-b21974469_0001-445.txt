405 degree. In some places there were opaque spots upon the inner surface of this vessel; and in others very considerable parallel sulci, running in a longitudinal direction ; and these were the more remarkable on account of their being intersected, at short distances, by transverse sulci. This arrange- ment being repeated quite to the arch of the aorta, and into the left carotid and subclavian arteries, gave an elegance of appearance to this surface. From the heart to the origin of the first upper branches of the aorta, its inner surface was diver- sified by spots, and marked out into furrows; but they were confused and irregular, so that it had only an appearance of great inequality. About two fingersâ€™ breadths above the semilunar valves, there was ulceration, and also three or four deep foramina, near each other, and each the size of a lentil. From these foramina, winding sinuses pro- ceeded obliquely to the external coat of the aorta, which in that place was of a dark colour, apparently from inflammation, and was greatly thickened by a deposition of humours. In the centre of this discoloration, the tunic was lacerated and blood had been effused into the pericardium. The left ventricle of the heart was greatly dilated, but the contiguous auricle was contracted and harsh. The cerebrum and cerebellum were flaccid; the vessels of the pia mater were somewhat turgid; and the vertebral arteries, where they enter the cranium, appeared to be a little wider than usual. Morgagni, xxvi. 21. Four aneurisms, at least, were found in this woman; namely, one of the left ventricle of the

229 had a somewhat livid complexion, and some osse- ous particles adhered to it. Immediately below this part of the dura mater, there was an abscess in the cerebral substance, but it was so small as to be scarcely adequate to receive a filbert within its parietes. It contained a thick and greenish pus. At the basis of the cranium a little serum had accumulated. Numerous vomicae were found in the lungs, as well as some tubercles which contained matter of a more solid consistence than that of pus. The pericardium was distended with a serous fluid. Valsalva, li. 19* Case 2. A woman fifty years of age, was struck with a stick on the head whilst she was engaged in wash- ing linen by the side of a river. The blow was given on the posterior part of the right side of the head, and the woman fell into the water. She was instantly drawn from the river, and though some stupor was the immediate consequence of the injury, yet that diminution of sensibility was of short duration, and her recovery appeared to ad- vance daily. On the fourteenth day, however, she had an accession of fever, which was preceded by rigor; and under a continuance of these febrile symptoms she died on the twenty-second day. Behind the right ear the serrae of the lambdoidal suture were separated from each other, and a serous fluid oozed from their interstices on slight com- pression. A little blood was extravasated within the cranium, at the corresponding part, but the brain itself was uninjured.â€”Valsalva, li. 25.

460 downwards; and when this lung was cut into, a purulent fluid escaped from the divided bronchia. There was an accumulation of yellowish serum in each thoracic cavity, and some flakes of lymph floated in the liquid. The pericardium adhered to the heart by a layer of coagulable lymph. The internal coat of the descending aorta had acquired a sort of tendinous hardness.—Morgagni, xviii. 25. Although there were many circumstances in this case likely to produce suffocation, it is probable that the immediate cause of death was of an apo- plectic nature; for the aneurism was so situated that it might compress the trunk of the superior vena cava, especially when the patient assumed the decumbent position, and perhaps he lay on the right side. It is not improbable that he had drunk a greater quantity of wine than usual, and thus the turgescence of vessels might have been increased. The stertor, foam at the mouth, tumid and livid face, which accompanied his decease, sanction the supposition of increased distension of the sac, and also of remora of blood in the head.—26. The destruction of bones, by the pressure of aneurisms, is a circumstance which often occurs. The small vessels of the periostium, and other vessels of that nature, (for instance, of the pleura) being placed between those resisting bodies and the aneurism, are injured by its continual and strong pulsations; and the small vessels in the % parietes of the aneurism sustain a similar lesion. I have often found marks of ulceration in the coats of arteries, especially those of the aorta,

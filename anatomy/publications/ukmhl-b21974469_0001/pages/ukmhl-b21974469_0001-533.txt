493 inconvenience of the disease at that period is but slight, and the danger is not imminent; and from its being wholly unobserved by the patient, he flatters himself with hopes of recovery. But his feelings must be widely different when the disease has attained that stage in which neither the suffering, which is constant and exceedingly grievous, nor death itself, which is hourly impend- ing, can be averted by any remedy. Patients who will not endure parsimony of diet when it might remove the disease, are sometimes necessitated to undergo the most extreme hunger from inability to swallow, when their strength is so exhausted, that abstinence accelerates the fatal termination; and when bleedings, which if early employed are beneficial, would likewise be injurious. The following case, though certainly an imperfect one, shows how much may be effected under this practice. An old woman came into the hospital at Bologna in consequence of inflammation of the eyes, when she was observed to have an aneurism, ndar the larynx, about the size of a walnut. It com- menced nine years before, after great bodily fatigue.

Into the left cavity of the thorax a little serum had been effused, and the texture of the lungs on that side resembled liver. The blood which occupied the right cavities of the heart contained bubbles of air. In the right lateral sinus of the dura mater there was coagulated blood, in the left the blood was fluid, and some moderately large air bubbles were blended with it. There were numerous bubbles also beneath the pia mater, especially about the anterior lobe of the left hemisphere of the cere- brum ; and there was a serous deposite under the same membrane. The ventricles were occupied by no inconsiderable quantity of serum, and which also flowed copiously from the vertebral canal, especially when the loins were elevated.

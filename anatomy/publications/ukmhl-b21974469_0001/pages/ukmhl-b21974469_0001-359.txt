319 Pulmonary Congestion. There is a state of the pulmonary organs in which the vessels of the lungs are loaded with blood, but which should be distinguished from inflammation. In the first case it arose from contraction in the aorta; in the second it is said to have existed in combination with inflammation.—Ed. Case 1. A damsel, who for some time had menstruated but sparingly, though it took place at the natural periods, was distressed with difficulty of respira- tion, and at length she died under the symptoms of suffocation. Dissection. A soft tumour was found in the parietes of the uterus. When the thorax was opened, the coats of the aorta at its origin were found to be so thickened that the caliber of the impediment which is presented to the descent of the diaphragm, and to the action of the abdominal muscles, when any essential organic mischief has occurred within the abdomen. In a case of ulceration of the mucous coat of the colon, and great inflation of this intestine, it was interesting to observe the quiescence of the abdomen during respiration. This function, indeed, appeared to be exclusively carried on by the agency of the intercostal muscles; and as the patient, for some time, was more conscious of pul- monary oppression than of any abdominal disorder, he referred to the lungs as the seat of his malady. The case will be related in a note to intestinal diseases. Sympathetic affections of the lungs are not only derived from the source to which I have just adverted, and also from injuries of the head; but they are liable to originate from local irritation in any other part of the body. Peripneumony is by no means an unfrequent consequence of wounds and of surgical opera- tions.—Ed.

498 During the space of three years it daily increased, and acquired a large size. About the third month before his death it became painful, and occasioned considerable oedema of the leg, the tumefaction of which was equal. Within the last month the pain was extremely violent, not only in the tumour, but sometimes also below the malleolus internus, in which place sensibility remained, but the rest of the foot was destitute of sensation and motion. Indeed no feeling was retained in the ankle except during the continuance of pain. Through the whole of the last month the patient had no respite from excruciating torture. Dissection. An immense cavity was found after death, extending from the anterior part of the thigh to the posterior crural nerve. The femoral artery, after being moderately dilated, had ruptured ; and the effused blood had formed the large cavity by detaching the muscles. The muscles were partially ulcerated, and the nerve itself was so eroded that only a few of its fibres remained by which the upper part was united to the lower.â€” Valsalva, 1. 11. The condition of the nerve elucidated the pre- vious state of the limb as to its sensibility. The sense of feeling and the power of motion were abolished, because nearly all the nerves which are distributed/to this part proceed from the posterior crural; but to the inner ankle a branch is distri- buted, which arises from the anterior crural nerve, and generally accompanies the vena saphaena. Whenever aneurisms, even those which are exter- nal, are seated very near the nerves, or other parts of acute sensibility, life may be destroyed by

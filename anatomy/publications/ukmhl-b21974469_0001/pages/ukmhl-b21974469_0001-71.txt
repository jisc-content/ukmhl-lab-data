31 Case 7. Apoplexy from extravasation on the surface, and within the substance of the cerebrum; and upon the cere- bellum. The subject of this case was a Venetian woman, fifty-five years of age, of florid countenance, rather tall in stature, and of plethoric condition of body. She had borne several children, and the abdomen had become so prominent as to disqualify her for active domestic duty; she was liable to severe pain in the colon—she drank freely of wine—became indolent—was inclined to sleep—and for some days she experienced troublesome noise in the head. About the third hour of the night she was seized with pain in the right temple and right eye, and afterwards became apoplectic. In about an hour she lost all control over her right hand ; vomiting, and afterwards stertorous breathing came on, and she died in about six hours. Dissection. The abdomen abounded with fat. Although thirty hours had elapsed since death, and the season was cold, some heat remained in seldom. One of the most striking cases of this kind which occurs to me is recorded by Valeriana Luigi Brera. The patient was fifty-five years of age, and died apoplectic. The ventricles were turgid with bloody serum; two large clusters of hydatids lay along the choroid plexuses, about two inches long, and each vesicle constituted an animal of very peculiar structure.—It had a head not unlike the tcenia; and a vesicle filled with water and beauti- fully organized; which was apparently formed by three distinct membranes, the external, delicate, transparent, and shining; the second consisting of minute circular fibres: and lastly a villous membrane, which invested the interior of the vesicle.—Ed.

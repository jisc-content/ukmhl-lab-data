177 Perforation of the membrana tympani and removal of the ossicula. In a woman who had not experienced more than dulness of hearing, Valsalva found the membrana tympani on both sides either totally or nearly destroyed by ulceration. On one side all the ossicula were thrown off, except the base of the stapes; and on the opposite side, the incus was disjoined from the stapes. A similar occur- rence was observed by Vieussens. If, however, after the rupture of the membrana tympani, the stapes be removed, not only will the tympanum be exposed to injury, but the delicate membranes of the labyrinth will also be laid open to detri- ment, through the fenestra ovalis. I never read of any person who preserved his hearing long after the stapes had been removed. Although the membrane of the tympanum is not essential to the faculty of hearing, it is requisite to protect those parts which are essential to this faculty, as the labyrinth, for instance, whose fenestrae it shields from mischief. When these delicate parts are exposed to external impressions, it is almost an inevitable circumstance that in the process of time hearing will be destroyed. If this did not happen to dogs in which the membranae tympanorum were lacerated by Valsalva and others, it was because the injury had been repaired. It must not be objected that those persons who have a foramen in this membrane, and can impel the smoke of tobacco through it, are not subject to these consequences, because very few cases are N

His mental faculties were impaired; and he sometimes voided calculi with his urine. Dissection. The omentum was so retracted that it concealed the whole anterior part of the stomach; the liver was morbidly adherent to the diaphragm; the stomach was corrugated, but when extended it was found to be unusually capacious; and the spleen was of double its natural size. There were four calculi in the left kidney, one of which was as large as a chestnut. The thorax was not opened. A quantity of serous fluid was deposited betwixt the dura and pia mater. Attached to the left plexus choroides was a body the size of a horsebean, constituted of numerous hydatids; and beneath the correspondent ventricle there was a sinus, the parietes of which consisted of a yellow and flaccid cerebral sub- stance, which appeared to be in a state of suppu- ration.—Valsalva, xi. 6.

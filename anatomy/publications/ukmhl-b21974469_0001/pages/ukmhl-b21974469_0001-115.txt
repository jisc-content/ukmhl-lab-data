In the right corpus striatum there was a foramen which communicated with an abscess that occupied a third part of the cerebral sub- stance on that side.— Valsalva, v. 2. It is probable that the fever was concomitant with the formation of the abscess, and that the remission of febrile symptoms happened, as usual, when the suppurative process was completed. When pus made its way through the corpus striatum, and was effused into the ventricles, it may be conjectured that the apoplectic symptoms commenced.—Morgagni, 3. Case 2. Apoplexy from pus in the ventricles. A woman, upwards of forty years of age, whose menstrual discharges had greatly decreased, had a cancerous tumour arise on the left leg, which, after some time, ulcerated, was very painful, and was accompanied with febrile symptoms. The leg was amputated.

416 from which it arises in most persons in the inci- piency of aortic aneurism, namely, the influence of the nervous system on the action of the heart and vessels; and nothing tends more to induce this excessive action than a stimulant plan of diet. In persons addicted to drinking, I have known this happen several times, and in all of them I believe the pulsation had been owing to the influence of the nerves, as there were no particular indications of other diseases ; or, if there were, they sustained an intimate relation to the nervous system. I am confirmed in this opinion by various observations. A case is extant in w hich, after cerebral pulsation, palpitation in the heart and arteries came on, which was perceptible to the extremities of the fingers. In a matron of Padua, Rhodius suspected the affection arose from the uterus ; and he alludes to another case, which also was ascribed to the same organ. When the heart is flaccid I ask how it can occasion a full and strong pulse, except through the influence of the brain and nerves.—35. When aneurisms do not begin in the vessels from laxity of the membranes, from ulceration, or injury, but from powerful action of the heart and arteries, the first lesion of the artery which discovers itself is the appearance of sulci in the inner coat; and after this, other injuries follow in the next coat, earlier or later in proportion to the impetus of the blood. In counteracting the progress, much may be effected by diet.*—37. * Morgagni does not appear to have attached all the impor- tance to the morbid state of the liver, in explaining the phenomena of this case, to which the diseases of that organ are entitled.

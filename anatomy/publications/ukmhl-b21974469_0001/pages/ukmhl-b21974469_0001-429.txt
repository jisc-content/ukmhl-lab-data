389 were certainly augmented, but the chief enlarge- ment pertained to the left ventricle. Its parietes were not thicker than natural, but the cavity was excessively expanded, and filled with black and grumous blood. The semilunar valves were indu- rated, contracted, and corrugated. The coats of the aorta were extenuated, and its inner surface not entirely exempt from longitudinal furrows, though they were obscure.—Morgagni, xxvii. 12. The dilatation of the other cavities was undoubt- edly occasioned by the dilatation of the left ventricle in the way that has been explained ; and if this young man had taken the precaution, when the nasal haemorrhage ceased, to have had blood withdrawn from a vein, at proper times, he would either not have died thus, or, at least, not so soon.—13. I wonder that the increased magnitude of the heart is not attended to in the histories of asthmatic persons; since it is often found enlarged to a considerable degree, and, unquestionably, is the cause of many of the symptoms. The enlarged heart not merely compresses the lungs, but it obstructs pulmonary circulation, and by these means it renders the breathing difficult. Other cases, besides the preceding, have been related, in which the heart had acquired such an immense size as to equal that organ in the ox. Gerbezius, on opening the body of a monk, found the heart so heavy as to weigh thirty ounces. In some cases of this nature, in addition to the difficulty of breathing, there occured palpitation, frequent deliquia, and ultimately, a sudden death. But in the instance of

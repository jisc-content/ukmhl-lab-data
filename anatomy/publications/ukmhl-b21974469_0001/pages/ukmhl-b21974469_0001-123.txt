Whilst examining these parts, thin pus flowed into the pharynx from the rupture of an abscess at the posterior foramina of the nostrils. The sinuses of the brain were excessively turgid with frothy blood, as well as the vessels of the dura mater and of the pia mater surrounding the cerebrum and cerebellum, and in that process of the latter membrane which lines the ventricles. In the substance of the cerebrum and cerebellum there were more bloody points than I had seen beforeâ€” they were diffused over every part. A small quantity of serum was deposited betwixt the mem- branes, and a larger quantity beneath the pia mater, and into the ventricles of the brain. The choroid plexuses were red and vesiculated. The scrotum was greatly inflated with air. Morgagni, v. 19. Cases similar to this occurred to Valsalva and Verdriesius. Experiments have been made on animals by Wepfer and other physiologists, to ascertain the effects of air injected into the veins. If very little was thrown in, they were temporarily distressed, but did not die; but death has been produced in various animals, even in the ox, by inflating the jugular vein. The death of the animal was g 2

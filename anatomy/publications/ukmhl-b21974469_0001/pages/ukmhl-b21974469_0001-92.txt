52 Serous Apoplexy. The discovery of a small quantity of water within the skull should not induce an immediate conclu- sion that it was the cause of death. At the end of this section a case will be detailed Which tends to shew that much fluid may sometimes be depo- sited in the head, without producing the apoplectic state. It will be observed in most of the cases, that the cerebral affection was complicated with other diseases. the secretions and excretions of the digestive organs, and to the quality and quantity of the ingesta. But it appears from the numerous dissections of Valsalva and Morgagni that apoplexy is liable to occur from various lesions of the cerebral organ itself, and in complication with, perhaps in a measure dependant upon, disease in every other organ. This I apprehend will be observed by all whose opportunities of morbid inspections are numerous. It falls, however, most frequently to the lot of old people, in whom the coats of the arteries are diseased. It has already been stated (vid. page 28) that out of twenty-three cases of apoplexy only three were in youths and four in middle-aged men. Mor- gagni entertained the opinion that the disease proved fatal most speedily in persons at a robust age; and in old people was most liable to degenerate into long continued palsy. Subsequent dissections have verified the opinion of this anato- mist that extravasation most frequently takes place in the corpora striata, the thalami nervorum opticorum, or the circumjacent parts of the brain; and in concurrence with him this has been ascribed to the peculiar disposition of the brain and the distri- bution of its vessels. Dr. Bricheteau has likewise minutely described the formation of a cyst in the substance of the brain, surrounding the coagulum of blood, and the consequent absorp- tion of it by the vessels of the cyst.â€”Ed.

357 because I have found other cavities, and also the blood-vessels, turgid with it. But I must say of flatus, as well as of worms, that they are more troublesome to the heart by pervading the stomach and intestines, than by occupying the pericardium. Those viscera are often so distended with £as as greatly to interfere with the descent of the diaphragm.*—Morgagni, xxiii. 16. Ossification of the heart and its valves; valves dilated —excrescences and other diseases on them ; conver- sion into cartilage. Case 1. Ossification of the heart. A beggar fifty years of age, who had previously been a wool-comber, became greatly emaciated, and had a hot skin, though the season was extremely cold, it being then near the end of January. At length he was found dead in his cabin. * Some French authors have so fully believed that worms have existed in the heart and pericardium that they have given them the specific name of cardiaire. These cases, however, are by no means well authenticated, and probably a peculiar configuration of portions of coagulable lymph has led to deception on this point. The pericardium has sometimes been dilated to a great degree by pus, in consequence of inflammation of the pericardium, or when the pleuritic coverings of the heart have been the seat of inflammation. Morgagni does not appear to have distinguished inflammation of the muscular tissue of the heart. Although it is evidently marked by its consequences, perhaps it seldom or never exists without the membranes being affected. Many in- stances of serous effusion have already been related, when treating on peripneumony, and others will be adduced with cases of hydrothorax.

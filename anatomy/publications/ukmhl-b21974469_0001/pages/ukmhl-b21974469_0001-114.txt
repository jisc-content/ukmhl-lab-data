74 Apoplexy from secretion of pus, and from bubbles of air in the brain. By separating the cases of apoplexy into san- guineous and serous, it was not intended to divide the disease itself, but to distinguish the more common appearances on the dissection. Other causes of apoplectic symptoms, however, are not unfrequently discovered, some of which are sub- joined. Case 1. Apoplexy from an abscess in the cerebrum, and effusion of pus into the ventricles. A man, thirty-three years of age, of a sanguineous temperament, and greatly addicted to the use of wine and tobacco, was seized with pain in the left side of his head, especially towards the occiput, which was followed by pain and imbecility of the cervical muscles on the corresponding side. At first there was violent fever, which afterwards sub- sided, and his pulse became not only slow but weak also, having little power of resistance; and his strength began to give way, so that he experienced of the secretions into them. This susceptibility to local conges- tion after excessive loss of blood, I presume depends upon the want of that due balance which, in a state of health, subsists between the nervous and vascular systems; but I am jealous of hypotheses in medicine, and to pursue them in the present work would be unwarrantable. Drs. Sanders and Seeds bled animals to death by puncturing arteries and veins. When this was effected by opening a large artery, the brain was almost destitute of blood; but when death was occasioned by opening a vein, a state of venous congestion was found to exist.â€”Ed.

II When the present highly improved state of medical science is contrasted with the ridicu- lous notions and barbarous practice of former ages, we are at once impressed and delighted with the remarkable contrariety; but we are apt to overlook the circumstances by which the superiority of modern times has been established. The various steps in the progress, however, ought not to be disregarded; for, in difficult researches, we derive encouragement from the recollection, that although the exer- tions of an individual may not advance philo- sophy in any perceptible degree, yet, owing to the power of example, and the successive influence of opinion, the most obscure, and apparently unsuccessful inquirer, may prove the first or the connecting link in a series of the most valuable discoveries. This observation has been often verified; and in no sciences more frequently than in those which tend to elucidate or alleviate disease. No objects of intellectual pursuit can afford more real interest to an en- lightened mind than the subjects in question; and in no allotment of human labour can indivi- dual exertion afford the prospect of greater ber nefit to mankind than in the medical profession.

287 left side or back. She had pain in the thorax, but its situation was scarcely definable. Besides fever, she was afflicted with difficulty of breathing and dry cough, and the distress was heightened by the supervention of ear-ach. She was repeatedly bled, but all efforts for her recovery were frustrated. Dissection. There was a little turbid fluid in both cavities of the thorax, but the smaller quantity existed in the right side. The lungs adhered to the pleura almost universally, and when detached a whitish pellicle, of an easily lacerable consistence, followed them. The subjacent membrane of the lungs was healthy; on other occasions, indeed, I have examined the lungs and pleura after being covered with these membraniform concretions, and have found them in a perfectly natural state. The lungs in the present instance were inflamed, espe- cially at the posterior part. They were dense and somewhat hard in texture, and in several places had acquired a blackish hue. The pericardium contained some turbid reddish liquid. There had been a little fluid deposited beneath the pia mater. The pineal gland was equal in size to a small grape, and when cut into, it emitted some turbid fluid and a little yellowish matter, and subsided. The membrana tympani, on each side, was of a dark colour and extremely flaccid, and those of the mastoid cells which were nearest to the membrane were more humid than is natural to them. One of the tympana was occupied by a puriform humour. The adjacent cellular substance belonging to the integuments of the head was distended with a kind of mucous water.

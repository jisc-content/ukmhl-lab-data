This dilatation causes them to become thinner, €t and to lose their spring and contractibility. These various “ changes finally dispose them to rupture, which would indeed, “ be the necessary termination of this disease, if the derangement “ which it produces in the circulation, and the functions depen- “ dant upon it, did not cause death before there had been suffi- “ cient time to allow the dilatation to reach the point which “ would render the rupture of its coats inevitable; an accident “ not without example.” “ A natural debility, a deficient excitability, a serous diathesis, ** blood deficient in its stimulating properties, appear to me to “ be perhaps necessary to give rise to, and certainly to favour “ the action of the causes of passive dilatation.” Corvisart has divided the general signs of aneurism of the heart into three stages; and the following is an abstract of the principal phenomena which he has recounted. First stage. The countenance is scarcely altered, but fre- quently it presents transient flushings; and the patient is easily fatigued. The sound is equally good in all the regions of the thoracic cavity, but there is often a painful sensation about the heart. The patient experiences frequent numbness and dazzlings;

426 proportionally more susceptible of lesion from percussion. Wounds in the right ventricle are more frequent than in the left, because the heart is so situated as to expose that ventricle most to injury. When the left has been wounded, life has not been preserved so long as after wounds of the right. In the former case it has not exceeded four or five days, and generally has happened much earlier : in the latter, a period of twenty-three days has elapsed from the reception of the injury to the fatal termination. The difference of time to which life is protracted after a wound of either ventricle, may arise from the extent of the wound, its obliquity or straightness, or from some obstruction presented to the escape of blood by coagula, or by the reticulated fibres within the ventricle being placed in opposition to the wound.*—Morgagni, liii. 27. * There are two forms of rupture of the heart spoken of by Corvisart, namely complete and partial. By the former is meant the bursting of the parietes from the interior to the exterior surface; and by the latter is meant that state when only a portion of the heart is ruptured, as the carne® column®, and chord® tendini®, which circumstance he had witnessed. “ Complete rupture of “ the heart,” sa^s that author, “ has rarely been observed in the “ healthy state of this organ. Some instances, however, may be “ cited, of this organic lesion, in consequence of a violent effort, ie a fit of passion, an epileptic paroxysm, or in actu coitus.” It is highly probable that, in the case by Morand alluded to above, the rupture took place from the last mentioned cause. Dr. Hebb, the translator of Corvisart, has referred to the death of George the Second, as affording a strongly marked instance of rupture of the right ventricle of the heart, without any previous symptoms of disease in that organ, and unattended by any of those circum- stances which are said occasionally to produce it.

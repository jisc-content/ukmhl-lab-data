360 of the heart. The parietes of the sac were much thickened, and, in places, they were ossified. Haller, after hereditary palpitation of the heart, found the valvulse mitrales universally ossified; and the coats of the neighbouring pulmonary sinus were also converted into bone, and part of the heart itself had nearly undergone this change. The pericardium was scirrhous in some places, and adherent to the heart. —xxiii. 12. Cases, however, occurred to Valsalva, and to other anatomists, in which, although the mitral valves were ossified or rigid, and unequal to their office, the patients, when living, did not complain of palpitation of the heart. Fan tonus found the mitral valves unusually hard and thick. On one of them there were two follicles, and on the other, one; each nearly as large as a vetch, from which, when opened, a yellowish and greenish matter escaped. The old man in whom it occurred had not had any symptoms of affection of the heart: he had only complained of slow fever, and debility of the stomach. An instance of a grey excrescence growing upon one of these valves occurred to me; yet there had neither been palpitation of the heart nor inequality of the pulse. Cases of induration and ossification of the valves have fallen under my observation, but they will be recorded in other places, on account of the diseases with which they were associated.—13. A case of contraction of the valves at the origin of the pulmonary artery has been recited.

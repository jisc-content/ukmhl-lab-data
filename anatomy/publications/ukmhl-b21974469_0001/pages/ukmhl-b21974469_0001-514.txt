lungs did in the preceding case ; yet the impetus of the blood which had effected the partial absorption of these cartilages, had not destroyed the adhesion, nor occasioned the ulceration of the much softer and thinner parietes of the aneurism. Those parts which yield to the impulse certainly sustain less injury than those which strongly resist it. The same immunity from lesion has happened to the pectoral muscles after the ribs have been destroyed. A case has been related by Schreiberus, in which a large aneurism of the aorta, under the pectorales muscles, was so ruptured that the aperture would admit the fist, and three of the ribs had been absorbed ; but though the lungs were pressed back their structure was uninjured; nor was the dia- phragm, though connected with the aneurism, or the pectoral muscles, at all disorganized.*—48. In the following case the sternum and bones connected with it were rendered carious by the continued action of the aneurism. * Morgagni, in common with other pathologists who preceded him, or who were his cotemporaries, believed that the bones became diseased and destroyed not only by the impulse of the aneurism, but, in a great measure, by the influence of an acrid secretion from the surface of the aneurism. But the destruction of those solid parts is now chiefly ascribed to absorption; and it has been supposed that cartilage is not so liberally supplied with absorbents as bone, from the circumstance that when car- tilage and bone have appeared to be equally subjected to the pressure and impulse of the dilated artery, the latter has been the more rapidly destroyed—Ed,

391 back, and from the irritation of the excrements. He died on the fortieth day. Dissection. The thorax was dissected, with the assistance of Hippolyto Francesco Albertini, who then was assistant-physician to this hospital. The lungs were closely adherent to the costal pleura, but this circumstance is very commonly met with in dissection. These viscera were of a black colour, and when cut into they were found to contain a secretion similar to that which had been expectorated, but of a thinner consistence. The pericardium contained nearly a pint and half of a dark-coloured serum, and the heart was nearly equal in magnitude to that of a bullock. The parietes of the right ventricle were greatly thick- ened, but the cavity was natural. The cavity of the left ventricle, however, was so much expanded, that it might have received within it another heart, but its parietes were so extenuated, that they appeared scarcely adequate to have sustained the action of the heart. The aorta was proportionably dilated, and consequently appeared rather to pertain to the body of an ox than to the human subject: its inner coat had a cartilaginous texture. Valsalva, xvii. 21. Intemperance in wine had been the first cause of this manâ€™s disease. That experienced physician Lancisi has affirmed, that out of a hundred cases of aneurisms, which arose spontaneously, more than fifty had occurred in gluttons and drunkards. It is probable that the dilatation of the artery had preceded that of the heart; and when the vessel became dilated and its parietes cartilaginous, and

377 Dissection. Some water was found in the thorax, and the heart had acquired an almost unprece- dented magnitude. This augmentation of bulk principally arose from dilatation of the right auricle and ventricle. Near the heart the aorta was con- tracted to an astonishing degree.* ** Morgagni, xviii. 6. In some instances where the right auricle and ventricle have been dilated, and the orifice between them has been enlarged, an impulse has been given to the blood in the vense cavse, and the jugular and brachial veins have pulsated ; and the former have been dilated. Lancisi proposed this venous pulsa- tion as a diagnostic sign of dilatation in the right cavities of the heart; but it sometimes arises where * Dr. Palloni has recorded an instance of passive dilatation of the right auricle, in consequence of which the heart had acquired double its usual size. It appeared to have originated in a con- traction of the coats of the aorta, and was complicated with general visceral disease.—Med. Chir. Journal, Sept. 1816. In the same Journal, February 1817, another case of passive aneurism of the right cavities is related. The man, who was a debauched character, had oppression of the chest, cough, and fetid expectoration. The paroxysms were aggravated, and, at length, he experienced decubitus difficilis on the right side and back. The pulsations of the heart were tumultuous and weak. The lungs were filled with yellow serum, and covered with a membrane of lymph. The heart was double its natural size; and the right auricle was very large and filled with coagulated blood. Its parietes were extenuated, the auriculo-ventricular opening was preternaturally large, the right ventricle was expanded, and its parietes were thin. The reporter adds “ the feeble strokes of the heart indicated “ passive aneurism in this case; and the tumultuous movement “ under the sternum, indicated also that the dilatation was seated ** in the right cavities of the heart.”—Ed,

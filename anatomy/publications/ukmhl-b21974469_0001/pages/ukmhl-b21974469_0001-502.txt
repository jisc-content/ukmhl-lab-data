462 Syncope occasionally arises from aneurism of the aorta, of which the following case affords an example. Case 4. Dilatation and disorganization of the aorta, with excrescences on the mitral valves, and disease in the sigmoid: spleen softened. A poor and rather emaciated woman, apparently about fifty years of age, twelve months before death was affected with syncope, to such a degree that she was supposed to be actually dead. After that time she underw ent several other attacks, and was ultimately found dead in bed. This circum- stance happened in the year 1726, and the body was sent to the anatomical theatre. Dissection. The abdominal viscera presented no appearances w orthy of observation, except that the spleen w as of a small size, and internally w as nearly of a fluid consistence. The left lung was united w ith the costal pleura in several places. Both the valvulae mitrales, near their edges, were rather thick and indurated ; and they exhibited a series of rather large globular bodies, w hich, when cut into, evinced a tendinous structure. The adjacent semilunar valves also, were thicker than usual, and one of these had its corpusculum Arantii enlarged, and adherent only by a very small portion. The aorta, immediately on going off from the heart, w as dilated ; and near the orifices of those branches which proceed from the arch, the inner surface of the artery was unequal, and so flaccid that the yellowish mem- braneous laminae could easily be pulled away wdth

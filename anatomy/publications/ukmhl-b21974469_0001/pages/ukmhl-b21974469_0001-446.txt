Many instances occur of the coexistence of aneurism in several parts of the sanguiferous system. Case 21. Passive aneurism of the whole heart, and dilatation of the aorta; from a menial affection.

A few days afterwards he was attacked with vertigo, and fell down; and on the following day he had convulsions, and an attack resembling epilepsy.

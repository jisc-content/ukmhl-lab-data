He soon observed in all of them, that the action of the heart was irregular and intermittent, and in one of them, in which he divided the nerve, he remarked that the action of the heart was excessively confused. The heart did not regain its usual regularity in these dogs, before the seventeenth, the twenty-ninth, twenty-third, and the twenty-seventh days. There- fore if any considerable injury happen to this nerve, or to any other connected with the heart, the conse- quence of that injury is manifest; and inutile brain, or the nerves, lesions which are irremediable, and consequently endure many years, or even till death, frequently occur. But as these lesions are not, in general, evident to the senses, it should not excite surprise if we are unable to detect the cause, after persons have been affected with a variously unequal pulse, either with a disorder of the heart or not. For although the diseases of the heart cannot speedily alter in their appearance, yet the lesion of the nerves, whence the peculiarity was derived, might be undiscoverable.â€”29. When intermission of the pulse does not arise from obstruction, or irritation in any other part, but from a cause existing in the heart itself, or in the neighbouring trunk of the aorta, or in both, then it must be considered as a symptom of importance. It has been occasioned by disease in the semilunar valves, and also in the tricuspid and mitral. Horstius found a deposition of calcarious matter in the tricuspid valves equal to the size of a small chestnut, and Bellini a similar deposition l 1 2

425 by a penetrating wound of the thorax, the arched situation of the diaphragm, and the circumstance that part of the abdominal viscera are within the ribs must not be forgotten. The liver, and other abdominal viscera, have many times been perfo- rated through a wound in the diaphragm. Beside the preceding example there are others which show that wounds may penetrate the ven- tricles of the heart, without immediate death being the consequence. When there is reason to appre- hend that the heart is wounded, and that blood has been effused, if there is no sense of weight in the thorax, but an increasing consciousness of it in the abdomen, there will be ground of conjecture that the diaphragm is so wounded as to transmit blood from the thorax into the abdomen; espe- cially when some other symptom tends to confirm the opinion: of this nature was the almost intole- rable cough in the case before us.*—4. The ventricles of the heart have been lacerated from an injury of the thorax, whilst the pericardium has remained entire. A man had received a leaden bullet in his chest, and died a few hours after- wards. The bullet was found exterior to the pericardium; nevertheless the right ventricle of the heart was ruptured. In such cases it is pro- bable that the ventricle was dilated at the moment the percussion happened. For in proportion as the parietes of the right ventricle, (being natu- rally thin,) are attenuated by dilatation, it will be * Other instances of wound of the diaphragm will be brought forward in the sequel of this chapter.—i?c?.

237 Dissection. The limbs were relaxed. Several parts of that surface of the intestines which is directed towards the loins, were of a blackish colour; and indeed the same colour was exhibited through the whole lumbar and iliac regions. Half the spleen was exceedingly livid ; and one of the lumbar vertebrae was fractured.— Valsalva, liv. 26. It may be difficult to account for the speedy termination of life in the former case in comparison with that of the latter; but it frequently happens that the different consequences of spinal lesions are not easily explicable. When there has un- questionably been injury done to the medulla, as, for instance, when it has been perforated by a bullet, life has been carried on for many days and even weeks. Indeed paralysis has not uniformly resulted even though the medulla had been wounded in the back. It is related of a soldier that the point of a sword, two inches in length, had passed through the twelfth dorsal vertebra, and was fixed there, exciting the most excruciating pains, but there was no consequent paralysis although the patient lived some months. Probably some of these variations of result are ascribable to the different degrees of concussion arising from the blow, by w hich, independently of other serious consequences, blood might be extra- vasated in parts remote from the point of collision. If the injury is inflicted upon the inferior lumbar vertebrae, of course it is the cauda equina which sustains lesion.—Morgagni, 27.

The upper part of the right lobe was hard and blackish; and the blood vessels of the same lobe were very firmly connected with the bronchia; and one of these vessels to an extent of some digits, was observed to be dilated. The trunk of the bronchial artery, at its origin from the aorta, was three times the usual diameter. On the posterior surface of the left ventricle of the heart a tubercle existed, which, both in figure and magnitude, corresponded with a moderate- sized cherry. One half of this body projected from the surface of the heart; the other was imbedded within its substance. It bore a strong resemblance to those hydatids which form within the substance of other viscera, as the lungs or kidneys. When pricked it emitted a small quantity of a watery fluid, yet the coats of this body retained a more turbid humour till they were laid open and compressed; and then not only was this humour discharged but also a small membrane containing some white parti- cles like mucus, and others that were of a tendinous firmness.

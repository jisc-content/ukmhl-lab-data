On the following morning he was brought into the hos- pital again, and died soon afterwards. At the request of the students I examined the body on the following day. Dissection. The face was somewhat tumid and red. The cranium having been sawn through some time previous to my arrival, nearly a pound of blood had flowed out of that cavity. Never- theless I conjectured that the principal cause of death existed in the thorax, and that the blood had accumulated in the head in consequence of thoracic disease, as usually happens to persons who are suffocated by those lesions.

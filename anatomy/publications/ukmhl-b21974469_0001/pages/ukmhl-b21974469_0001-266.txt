Vessels exterior to the cranium might be ruptured from the same cause, and the blood poured from them may flow through the ears, nose, or mouth; but if the fissure happen to reach the petrous process as in the preceding case, or if the blood be extravasated betwixt the dura mater and cranium near the foramina of the tympanum, blood might find access to the tympanum and be dis- charged from that cavity, through the Eustachian tube, into the nostrils and fauces.â€”Morgagni, 52.

A large quantity of coagulated blood was contained within the cranium, and the basis cranii was fractured transversely. The fis- sure traversed from side to side, passing anterior to the petrous portions of the temporal bones, and through the posterior part of the sphenoidal sinuses. In that ear from which the blood had escaped, the osseous part of the meatus audi- torius was fractured, and the membrana tympani

164 The remainder of the nerve to the point of union with the opposite, was of an ash colour both exter- nally and internally, and was evidently slender. From the point of union, however, both nerves presented a natural appearance.â€”Morgagni, xiii. 8. Whilst examining the brain of a man who died in this hospital, I found that the right optic nerve was attenuated and of a cineritious colour from its junction with the left even to the orbit, yet this person had not been blind in either eye. Morgagni, lxiii. 8. Case 2. Ossification of the retina. In a man who had been blind in one eye from birth, and who was killed by a blow on the head, the eye presented the following appearances. The adnata was crowded with vessels. The cornea was opaque, and much smaller than usual, and did not retain its wonted figure. The ball of the eye too was considerably less than the natural size, and was not spherical. When it was divided a blackish fluid escaped; but no vestige of vitreous or cry- stalline humour was discoverable. The tunica sclerotica was contracted; and the uvea was adherent to the choroides: but we could not dis- tinguish the iris or the corona ciliaris. Beneath the tunica choroides, instead of the retina there was a thin bony lamella, which, proceeding from the insertion of the optic nerve, was entire, and preserved the figure of the eye. It extended quite to the circumference of the organ; and there it adhered more closely to the uvea than to any

168 Morgagni, lxiii, Ck in a much worse condition. The optic nerve had become exceedingly slender, and instead of con- taining medullary matter, the whole interior struc- ture of the nerve within the orbit consisted of a whitish and very compact substance. The state of the nerve within the cerebrum I had not an oppor^ tunity of ascertaining.—Morgagni, lxiii, 4. Case 6. Blindness after smallpox, from disease in the lens, <§c. I dissected the eye of a man who became blind from smallpox at an early period of life. On puncturing the back part of the tunica scle- rotica, a quantity of limpid water immediately escaped. The remaining part of the vitreous humour remained attached to the crystalline as usual. The lens was small; and in the centre of its anterior surface it was opaque and soft; and when cut into perfectly limpid water flowed out of it. Having divided the residue of membraneous tissues, both sections exhibited a series of ex- tremely minute blackish particles, carried directly through the middle, from one extremity of each section to the other; whereas in other parts the colour was of a faint whiteness. The coats of the optic nerve were thickened within the orbit, and the medullary substance was unusually moist; but within the cranium the nerve was in a natural state.

Examples are not wanting of bones found in the falx from which no inconvenience had resulted, which my own observations have confirmed. Be- sides other instances I met with bones in that membrane in a man and woman whose bodies I dissected in 1720 and 1744. In the former a bone was situated on each side of the longitudinal sinus, in the very substance of the dura mater, of no inconsiderable size, one of which terminated in oblong and acute teeth; in the woman there were three little bones; I could not learn the precise circumstances of either before death, except that the woman, who was a beggar, died from hoemop- tysis.

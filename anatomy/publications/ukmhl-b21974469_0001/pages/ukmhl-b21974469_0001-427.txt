387 dilated, and the capaciousness of the ventricles, especially of the left, was greatly augmented. The parietes of the left ventricle were so extenuated as scarcely to equal the ordinary thickness of the right. The aortic valves were slender and con- tracted, and also somewhat rigid and hard. The ramifications of the coronary arteries were loaded with blood. The inner coat of the artery was variegated with large opaque spots, which were the beginning of ossification; and the process had advanced, in the arch of the aorta, where we found the spots more evidently approached the nature of bony laminae: and though the parietes were no- where completely ossified, they were hard, and of an intermediate texture between cartilage and ligament. The vessels in the dura mater, as well as in the pia mater, were distended with blood of a black colour.—Morgagni, xviii. 2. The dilatation of the heart was probably occa- sioned by the contraction of the aorta, and its preternatural course through the diaphragm, aided by the sedentary life, and the position common to shoemakers ; for by these circumstances the circu- lation of blood through the aorta and its inferior branches must have been impeded. In some cases, perhaps, there is congenital laxity of the whole heart or of some part of it; and it seems necessary to acknowledge this when, from obstruction in the aorta, the right, and not the left ventricle, is dilated. In general, however, the obstruction and dilatation correspond.—4. My own observations, and those of others so far c c 2

On examination after death he was found to have empyema, and the pus filled the left cavity of the thorax. The upper lobe of the left lung was somewhat indurated; and towards the clavicle, the cells of which this organ consists, were enlarged to an astonishing degree; and indeed some of them were equal in size to a filbert. Some of them were globular, others were of an oval or oblong figure; and they were all full of air, and, outwardly, were supplied with blood vessels. One of them exhibited small foramina opening upon the internal surface.*—Valsalva, xxii. 12. Peripneumony terminating in serous effusion into the thorax or pericardium. Case 1.

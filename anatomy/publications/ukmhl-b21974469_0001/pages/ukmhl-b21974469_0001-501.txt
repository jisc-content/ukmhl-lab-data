461 when the constitution has been affected with lues venerea.—27. Aneurisms of the aorta sometimes present the appearance of an almost equal dilatation of the artery; at others, as in the preceding instance, one part of the artery gives way, and the aneurism is a kind of sac. I possess four specimens of aneurism that were stuffed and dried by the celebrated Vulpius, all of which are either in the arch of the aorta or in the space between the heart and that curvature; and three of them are of the latter species.*—37. * In several of the ensuing cases the disease presented that form of preternatural and equal dilatation to which Morgagni has adverted. But Scarpa, Hodgson, and other writers on this sub- ject, distinguish that uniform expansion of the coats of the artery from aneurism, though, like that disease, it is often combined with disorganization of the coats of the artery, and sometimes with a genuine aneurismal lesion. It is most frequently observed in the ascending portion, and the arch of the aorta, and some- times takes place to an almost incredible degree. The morbid alteration in the coats of the vessel which precedes and accom- panies this dilatation, is usually either thickening, or a deposition of atheromatous or of calcareous matter : but sometimes, though indeed very rarely, the dilatation exists without a perceptible lesion of texture, and has arisen from a contraction in a more distant part of the aorta. Though it is most common, as already observed, in the ascending portion of the aorta, it is often seen in the farther course of that artery, and at the angles where the arteries divide. Sometimes the dilatation in the vessel takes place only on one side, where it expands into a sort of pouch greatly resembling an aneurism. These dilatations seldom con- tain lamellated concretions. I have not thought it necessary to disjoin these cases from those strictly aneurismal; indeed, in some of them, the distinguishing characters were not very obvious.—Ed.

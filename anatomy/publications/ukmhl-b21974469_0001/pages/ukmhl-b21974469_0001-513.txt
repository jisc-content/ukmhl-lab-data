473 bodies and lateral processes of the vertebrae, and the contiguous extremities of the left ribs, and these bones were extremely excavated, though not to the spinal canal. The lungs were consolidated where they were conjoined to the aneurism, and were so closely agglutinated to it, as to supply the office of the arterial coats, which had been destroyed to an extent of two digits. There was no shell of concretions within the aneurism, but the structure of the parietes was so tender that it could easily be pulled away in scales. Both the ovaria were black, and the left was hard, and partly filled with half-coagulated blood. They were united with the Fallopian tubes, and had some hydatids upon them of different sizes: one of them on the left was particularly large, and this, with numerous others on the same ovary, would have contained four ounces of fluid. The tubes were impervious; and the cervix uteri was pervaded by some dark yellow mucus, of a tena- cious consistence. The glandular substance of the mammae contained serum which in some places was of a green, in others of a black colour; but the texture appeared to be healthy. There was fluid in the spinal canal.â€”Morgagni, xxi. 47. It should not excite surprise that whilst the aneurism had hollowed out the bones, the much softer texture of the lungs, and the medium of agglutination in the circumference of the ulcer, were not destroyed. A case occurred to Maloet, in which, though an aneurism adhered to the trachea, so that the cartilages of this tube consti- tuted a portion of the aneurismal parietes, as the

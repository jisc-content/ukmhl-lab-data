352 The aorta exhibited considerable evidence of incipient ulceration, and still more decisively displayed the rudiments of ossification in several places, where it descended upon the thoracic ver- tebrae.—Morgagni, xxiv. 1 ]. In a boy whose body was examined by Valsalva, there was adhesion of the pericardium to the heart, but he observed nothing except emaciation. In two men in whom the adhesion existed there was no palpitation, nor any peculiarity in the pulse, though in one of them the pericardium was in some places cartilaginous. This man had com- plained of constriction at the chest. I have found the pericardium universally adherent to the heart in seven bodies. In only one of them was there an intermitting pulse and palpitation, and this arose from a very close adhesion of the pericardium, not only to the ventricles and right auricle, but even beyond the basis of the heart, to the root of the great vessels.—Morgagni, xxiii. 21. In observations made by that assiduous and cautious man Albertini, so far from mentioning palpitation as a symptom, he says that he had rather observed the motions of the heart restrained, so that they could scarcely be perceived ; and if palpitation and intermission do occasionally exist, it is in consequence of some other affection, as enlargement of the heart.—22. It is highly probable that some of those cases in which the pericardium is said to have been wanting, were instances in which the pericardium had become closely united to the heart. Haller entertained this opinion. Indeed, unless the parts

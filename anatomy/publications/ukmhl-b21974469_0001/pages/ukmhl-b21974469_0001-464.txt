424 Case 5. Perforation of the right ventricle of the heart, and of the diaphragm. In November, 1688, a man thirty-five years of age, was wounded with a knife in the middle of the sternum between the fifth and sixth ribs. Great prostration of strength immediately ensued ; the pulse was scarcely perceptible, and his physi- cian expected death would speedily occur. After the lapse of three hours he had regained a degree of strength, and was brought into the hospital of St. Mary de Vita. On the following day he had a troublesome cough, and urgent diarrhaea; but on the sixth the latter ceased, whilst the former increased daily, to such a degree as to be scarcely tolerable. From the first days there was a sensation of prodi- gious weight in the abdomen, which, in the progress of the disease, extended over the whole of that cavity ; but no similar feeling existed in the thorax. During the earlier days after the injury was in-? dieted, the pulse was full and moderately quick ? it continued quick, but daily became smaller, and on the eighth day he gradually expired. Dissection. As soon as the thorax was pene-r trated on the right side of the sternum, blood gushed from that cavity ; and when the cavity was cleared of blood, more was observed to pour from the abdomen through a wound in the diaphragm. The abdomen contained a large quantity of blood. The pericardium, right ventricle of the heart, and mediastinum, were transfixed as well as the diaphragm.â€”Morgagni, liii. 3.

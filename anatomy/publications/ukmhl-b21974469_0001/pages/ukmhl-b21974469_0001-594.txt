554 Wounds of the diaphragm are not necessarily fatal. Many examples might be adduced of wounds in the muscular part having healed; and although it is more difficult to find examples of recovery from injuries inflicted on the tendinous portion, a case is recorded by the father-in-law of Sennertus, in which, after two months, the patient thought himself well for five months. It must, however, be acknowledged, that wounds of this septum are generally mortal. The diaphragm is sometimes lacerated inde- pendent of any wounding instrument, and some of the abdominal viscera have been found in the thorax. This has happened in consequence of the natural openings being dilated or lacerated; in other cases the fibres have been torn asunder, and this accident is particularly liable to occur betwixt those fibres which proceed from the ensiform car- tilage and the neighbouring fibres. In some cases the diaphragm has been found perforated apparently from malformation, and the stomach has been found lying in one of the thoracic cavities, death taking place under circumstances which did not lead to any suspicion that this form of hernia existed. In the case of an old man, the stomach, omentum, part of the pancreas, and colon, were found lying in the left thoracic cavky ; and the foramen, which was in the fleshy part of the diaphragm, was large, and circumscribed by a tendinous circle. On examining the body of a young man, the stomach was found in the right cavity, and the freedom from lungs indicated that this was an instance of malformation. He had not

70 that serous deposition is a cause of apoplexy ; but who consider the accumulation of blood in the vessels ramifying upon the membranes and passing through the substance of the brain as the cause, and the effusion of serum, as the effect. In general, I believe, this is true; but those who have denied that a serous fluid is ever the cause of apoplexy,* appear not sufficiently to have observed that ex- travasations of blood do not always arise from the rupture of distended vessels, nor, in all cases, from the present impetus of circulation, for the coats may be pierced by ulceration, or by the attenuation resulting from previous repeated distensions. It has been shown by the preceding cases that apo- plexy may arise from vascular and extra-vascular compression. The effects of compression have been demonstrated within the human body and in brutes, when a considerable portion of the skull has been removed ; for by pressing the brain with the hand, the same symptoms came on which attend apoplexy, and gradually vanished when this pres- sure was removed. It is farther elucidated by the operation of trepanning when blood is extra- vasated upon the meninges; by which operation, and the removal of the blood, instant death is some- times averted.—33. Consequences similar to those which arise from effusion of blood, may ensue from deposition of se- rum. It might indeed be the effect of retarded or obstructed circulation through the head; but the compression arising from this excessive secretion may be considered as the ultimate occasion of apoplexy—34.

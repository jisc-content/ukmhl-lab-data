219 part; and under neither of these circumstances can it with propriety be designated counter-fissure. Strictly speaking those cases only are entitled to this appellation in which the solution of continuity is not beneath the part at which the stroke was received; but it is by no means requisite that it should exist at the opposite side.— Morgagni, li. 40. Case 7. Fracture, with extravasation of blood on the contrary side. A man thirty years of age, in a paroxysm of delirium from acute fever, cast himself from a window and wounded the left side of his head, above the temporal muscle. He was rendered speechless; his face was florid; the whole of the left side of his body was motionless, except that one or two hours after the fall, whilst the wound was handled, the foot contracted slightly, and soon after- wards extended itself. He died on the third day. Dissection. The cranium was fissured in the part beneath the left temporal muscle; but there was no manifest lesion of the encephalon which corresponded in situation with the fracture. On the opposite side, however, about two ounces of blood were extravasated between the dura and pia mater; so that it was evident that the hemiplegia of the left side was occasioned by this sanguineous effusion, and not by the wound or fracture of the same side. The vessels of the pia mater were turgid with blood; but this turgidity probably had more relation to the previous delirium than to the accident.—Valsalva, li. 42.

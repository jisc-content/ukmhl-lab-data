495 other veins and arteries. If, from the obstructions which arise in disease, or from the influence of mental passions acting upon the right cavities of the heart, the pulmonary artery, the lungs and pulmonary vein, as well as upon the left cavities of heart and aorta, the motion of the blood through the vena cava should be impeded, the dilatation and rupture of that vessel are likely to happen; and though there is not equal probability of this accident occurring to the pulmonary vein, yet instances of that occurrence are not wanting. Several cases of rupture of the vena cava are recorded, but they were mostly complicated with disease in the heart or aorta. It is highly desirable that those who meet with rupture of the vena cava, especially when uncomplicated, should accurately and perspicuously record the symptoms which preceded death, as well as the appearances on dissection.—Morgagni, xxvi. 28. Although the following cases do not strictly relate to aneurism, their introduction here will not be unseasonable. The first was communicated to me by that learned physician Manfredi, in the year 1718. the alimentary canal. Depletives will often be found a palliative remedy, when there is no rational ground to expect that tit can avail as a curative measure. There is a limit, however, beyond which the abstraction of blood, and other debilitating agents, so far from impeding the current, occasion an irritative and unequal distribution of blood, which is by no means favourable to the removal of this morbid state of the vascular system, or to the alleviation of the distressing symptoms which arise from it.—'Ed.

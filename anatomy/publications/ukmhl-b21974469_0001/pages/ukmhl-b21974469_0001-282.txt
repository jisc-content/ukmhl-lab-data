A small coagulum was found in the heart, but with this exception all the blood was in a fluid state. When the cranium was opened, serum which pre- sented the appearance of a gelatinous concretion, was observed about the blood vessels of the pia mater. The ventricles were filled with limpid water; and a similar fluid was observed in the upper part of the spinal canal. The compages of the brain were more flaccid than usual.â€” Valsalva, xv. 6. Case 2. Dyspnoea from turgescence of vessels, and Jlaccidity of the brain. A woman about forty years of age, the mother of a family, was supposed by the physicians who at- tended her, to labour under pulmonary congestion, and died in the hospital the beginning of April 1741. During the last days of her life the pulse was lan- guid and the face florid ; but she had neither deli- rium nor coma. I carefully dissected the body. Dissection. None of the abdominal viscera pre- sented any unnatural appearances; but the left ovary contained an hydatid the size of a walnut, and there was a tumour on the fundus of the ute- rus. The thoracic viscera were likewise perfectly healthy. The vessels of the pia mater, and those distributed through the substance of the brain, were extremely turgid with blood; and the cerebellum was of an exceedingly soft consistence. Morgagni, xv. 8.

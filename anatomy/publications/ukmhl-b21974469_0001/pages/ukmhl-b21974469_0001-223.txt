183 side and broader on the other than usual; so that there was an unequal distribution of the olfactory nerves. Another and more frequent cause of difference between the two nostrils arises from a great inclination of the septum narium to one side. It has been said that this septum has always an inclination to one side in adults, but although this often occurs, my numerous observations convince me that it is by no means universal. Morgagni, xiv. 16. Polypi. Polypi of the nose have not only a diversity of situation, but their textures vary. They have been found fleshy, cartilaginous, and bony. I should consider the latter, however, rather as bony excrescences than polypi. The true nasa polypus seems to be constituted of a tissue between that of glandular and fleshy bodies. Ruysch observed them growing from the maxillary sinus, and pro- ceeding through the excretory foramen into the nostril; and they probably originate from the other cavities. Generally, however, they grow from the Schneiderian membrane exterior to the sinuses, where the membrane is thicker and more obviously glandular.â€”Morgagni, xiv. 17. A man had polypi growing out of each nostril; and the cavity of the right nostril being laid open after death, a polypus was found connected with each turbinated bone. Their origin could be clearly traced to the mucous membrane of these bones; and the glandular texture of the polypi was the most obvious in the parts nearest to the membrane.

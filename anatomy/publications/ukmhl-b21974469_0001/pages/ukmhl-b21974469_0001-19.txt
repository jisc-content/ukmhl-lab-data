XI abridgement I had condensed the epistles from that translation; but when I afterwards resolved on submitting the work to the public under another form, I went over the ground a second time, carefully examining the original as well as the translation. My epistolary abridgement from Alexander, however, had convinced me that to render the work at all suitable to the present time, considerable freedom should be indulged. I have, therefore, not considered myself bound to give a literal interpretation when it appeared practicable to express the same idea more precisely in fewer words—nor have I always followed Morgagni’s order in describing the particulars of individual cases. In exercising this freedom I have incurred more responsibility, and exposed myself to much additional labour, but I trust it will appear that by this means greater perspicuity has been gained without any sacrifice of faithful descrip- tion. In the arrangement of the whole I have not studied nosological order, but following Morgagni's general divisions, with the exception of the last chapter, I have divested the work of epistolary desultoriness, and have endeavoured to throw its contents into a natural and available.

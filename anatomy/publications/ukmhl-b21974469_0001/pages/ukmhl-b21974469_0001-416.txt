376 the left; and its parietes were doubly fleshy. The foramen ovale was sufficiently open to admit the little finger. Two of the tricusped valves were smaller than usual. The semilunar valves, at the origin of the pulmonary artery, were slightly ossi- fied, and so united together that only a small foramen, sufficient to admit a lentil, was left between them; and at this foramen, small and fleshy membraneous productions existed, and were so placed as to act as valves, yielding to the blood as it proceeded from the heart, and resisting its return. —Valsalva, xvii. 12. It is probable that the preternatural appearance in the mouth of the pulmonary artery originated in malformation; and to the gradual increase of ob- struction from that cause, all that the girl suffered might be attributed.*—Morgagniy xvii. 13. Case 5. Dilatation of the right auricle and ventricle, from contraction of the aorta. The man who was the subject of this case was often annoyed with attacks resembling incubus, and with difficulty of respiration; and to these affections slight fever was added. After the loss of blood he appeared convalescent; nevertheless the disease recurred, his face and neck acquired a livid com- plexion, and he died. * The pulmonary sigmoid valves are much less frequently diseased than the aortic. Corvisart had found them slightly indurated; but in reference to the above case of agglutination, so as scarcely to leave an opening between them, he says, Morgagni is the only author who has observed this pathological state.—JEcf,

408 urine, and the left was occupied by a redundance of fluid, though not equal in excess with that of the opposite cavity. The upper lobe of the left lung contained a white fluid, that was puriform rather than purulent. The mucous membrane of the trachea and bronchia was of a reddish brown colour. The pericardium contained a little fluid similar to that in the thorax. The heart was greatly enlarged, not from thickening of its parietes, but from the dilated state of its cavities. The carnese columnse in the right ventricle, however, were enlarged, as were also the valves; and the orifices of the coronary arteries were dilated. The aorta, from its origin to the begin- ning of its curvature, was dilated ; and on its internal surface there were small protuberances where the coat was thickened, indurated, and generally white. The intestines were inflated with gas; the liver was somewhat indurated, and of a bluish tint. The spleen was slightly enlarged; the mucous coat of the stomach was of a reddish brown colour; and amongst the convolutions of the intestines there was no inconsiderable quantity of serous fluid. The cranium was not opened. Morgagni, lxiv. 5. Here was a case of ddatation of the whole heart and of the aorta, originating from an affection of the mind, through the medium of the nervous system.

445 I have observed both that odour and colour. Those that were thin and flexible resembled horn. Haller and some other anatomists have spoken of the concretions in an aneurism of the aorta as resembling bone, and when I designate them bone, whether formed in the arteries or in other parts, I intend to express no more than similitude to bony structure, which they seemed to resemble in pro- portion as they were unlike stony or calculous concretions. I do not maintain that the same elegant structure is given to these morbid bones as to natural ones. No observations are extant of their being observed to be fibrous, nor is a fibrous arrangement observable in the dense and compact callus which unites fractured bones. Shall we, on this account, maintain that the callus is not of an osseous nature ?â€”Morgagni, xxvii. 20. The bony scales which form in the arteries do not exist in the inner coat, but are covered by it; and are often united with considerable marks of ulceration. In the case of the old man just related, at one part the annular fibres of the middle coat could be separated from the lamina without injuring them; yet in others the fleshy fibres appeared quite destroyed to the external coat. In another old man the vasa vasorum of the aorta were much distended, which is to be regarded as an evidence of permanent inflamma- tion, and internally there were bony scales; but, in some places, the ulceration had not only destroyed the inner lining, but the middle fibrous coat of the artery was converted into a red and putrid substance. In the aorta of an old woman, the

308 pericardium was plentifully laden with a reddish fluid. A degree of inflammation had existed in some of the abdominal and pelvic viscera; and the spleen was impregnated with a gangrenous blackness. These organs exhaled a most offensive odour. As soon as the cranium was opened, an acid smell, like the halitus of children who have worms, was perceived. The vessels of the dura mater were turgid, and there was fluid between that membrane and the pia mater. The cerebrum was a little softer than natural, and the cerebellum was much more so.*—Morgagni, xxi. 29. Case 9. Thickening of the pleura, and ossification of the falx. In March 1745 I dissected the body of a middle- aged man, who had been a stone-cutter. The assistant physician of the hospital being present, we learned from him that the man was attacked, in the first place, with fever, and soon afterwards with acute pain in the right side; and we also ascertained that diarrhoea then came on, so that he had eight * Morgagni has not given a precise statement of the degree of thickening which the pleura costalis had undergone. This some- times consists of little more than opacity, but at other times it is perceptibly thicker to the touch as well as to the eye. It may not only be thickened by enlargement of vessels and deposition within its texture, but by accretion of coagulable lymph and its subse- quent organization. I possess a specimen, taken from a phthisical subject, in which the pleura was half an inch in thickness, and seemed to consist of a dense cellular tissue, but distinctly vas- cular. Other cases in which this membrane was thickened have been related.—Ed.

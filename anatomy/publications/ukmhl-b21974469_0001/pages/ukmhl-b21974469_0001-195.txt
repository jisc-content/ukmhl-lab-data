The voice will be modified by roughness in the rima glottidis; by disease or defect in other resonant parts, as the nostrils and palate ; and by relaxation of the fibres of the glottis. Two of the following observations relate only to that aphonia which succeeds lesion of the brain; and the affection appears to be of a nature between apoplexy and paralysis.

Morgagni which shows how powerfully the mind may be agitated, even where the intelligent and professional character of the individual would have forbidden the expectation of such an oc- currence. Alberto Fabbri who was the first physician in Bologna a little before Morgagni’s time, was seized and strongly held by one hand, by a patient labouring under hydrophobia, while he was feeling the pulse with the other. He became so extremely dejected, as scarcely to command his reason, and the idea of self-destruction often occurred to him. For seven days he had abstracted himself from society when his attention being rivetted through perpetual gloom, he was wetted to the skin under a heavy shower previous to his being conscious of it. The place was solitary, and before he could obtain shelter his melancholy was washed away. It is probable his imagination was influenced by a reliance on the efficacy of a sudden and unexpected pro- fusion of water in averting hydrophobia. Here certainly no hydrophobic symptoms had arisen, but in other cases, from equally unwarrantable grounds, they have been developed; and perhaps but for the propitious shower, a modification of them, at least, might have been the destiny of Fabbri.—Ed,

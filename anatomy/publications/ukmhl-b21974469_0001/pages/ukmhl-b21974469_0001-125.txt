85 SECTION VI. Paralysis. Paralysis usually arises from the same causes that produce apoplexy, operating in a mitigated degree. It generally is the sequel of that formi- dable disease; but occasionally it occurs without having been preceded by that somnolency which constitutes an essential part of the apoplectic malady; and sometimes it originates from intes- tinal irritation. Each of these sources will be elucidated in the following cases. Case 1. Paralysis from an apoplectic cell beneath the left ventricle. A man, seventy years of age, addicted to great excess in diet, having long before been attacked with that the disgusting and degrading vice of excessive drinking is one which very generally inflicts its own punishment. The deplora- ble consequences of habitual inebriation usually develop them- selves by slow degrees, but it is not unfrequent for an apoplectic fit to occur during the excitement and plethora of debauch. Though a habit of excessive indulgence in eating is not equally dis- graceful and humiliating in its immediate effects with that of the intemperate use of spirituous or fermented liquors, it is one which tends with almost equal certainty, to impair the functions both of mind and body, and to induce a series of irremediable organic lesions. The medical practitioner who is actuated (as I firmly believe most in the profession are) by sentiments of humanity, will often feel himself called upon closely to investigate the con- duct of his patient in relation to these and other branches of his domestic conduct, and will kindly warn him of the issue. He will then have the unspeakable satisfaction of having done his duty—but his pleasure will often be lessened by the discovery that his friendly and disinterested caution was unheeded.—JEd*

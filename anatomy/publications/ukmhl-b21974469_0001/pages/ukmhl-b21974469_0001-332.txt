292 instances the affection of that membrane was more distinct. In some of them there appeared only an increase of vascularity, and consequently of red- ness ; in others the pleura was opaque and thick- ened ; in one, sphacelation had taken place; and in two, the membrane was ossified. Case 1. Inflammation of the pleura. A young man who had previously laboured under chronic fever, was seized with an acute febrile affection, united with pain of the thorax, difficulty of respiration, cough, and occasional expectoration of matter which was tinged with blood. During the earlier period of this attack he generally lay on the left side : and during the latter days of life he constantly preserved that position. He died about the sixteenth day. Dissection. The magnitude of the spleen was augmented in at least a three-fold degree. The left lung was extremely turgid ; it was also univer- sally inflamed and indurated, and adherent to the costal pleura; and this membrane was slightly red. The pericardium was distended by a fluid resem- bling whey; and there were some concretions scattered on the surface of the heart. Valsalva, xx. 51. Enlargement of the spleen is a frequent conse- quence of protracted febrile diseases. In Hungary this viscus is almost constantly found in a state of infarction after slow' fevers, but more particularly as a consequence of quartan ague.â€”Morgagni, 52.

440 It cannot be denied that the aorta, in this state, will resist the current of blood thrown into it from the heart; and on that account it will be adequate to create palpitation, difficulty of respiration, and that sense of straitness with which the woman was distressed. At the same time, it is necessary to advert to the numerous instances in which the aorta has been found in this state, whilst many of the patients did not suffer any of these affections, or at least, in an urgent degree. To explain this difference, other circumstances must undoubtedly be united with the disease in the aorta. There may be a diversity in the quality and quantity of the blood—in the state of the organs—or in that of the nervous system. With this condition of the aorta, an enlarged heart and dilated coronary arteries have been found, after there had been palpitation of the heart; and if the aortic valves are diseased, as they were in the preceding case, so that a portion of blood returns into the left ven- tricle, when it should receive the blood coming in from the lungs, it would happen that both the lungs and heart would sometimes be overloaded. Under these circumstances too, the heart will occasionally be excited to act with unnatural force. Two cases have been adduced by Vieussens, in which, after great palpitation of the heart, inequa- lity of the pulse, and incapability of lying with the head low, the aorta and its valves were found ossi- fied ; and similar cases will be found in different authors: nevertheless, they do not all distinctly mention palpitation as having been a previous symptom.

401 the feet, nor of any other external part. On the day after death, when the integuments were removed from the abdomen, it was observed that the muscles began to look greenish, and on the next day the tinge was deepened, though the weather was very cold. The abdominal viscera had not been dis- eased, but they soon became highly offensive. There was nothing preternatural in the distribution of the radial arteries. There was no accumulation of serum in the thorax, nor were the pleurae conjoined. The pericardium, however, was thickened, and ap- peared of a tendinous structure; and the heart was enlarged. Its parietes were thicker than ordinary, but the interior structure of this organ was natural, with the exception that the sinus of the left auricle was more capacious than usual, and its inner surface displayed greater inequality. The corpuscula Arantii of the aortic valves were thickened, and three coronary arteries originated from the aorta instead of two. The aorta was dilated from its valves nearly to the part from which the inferior intercostals originate: and its coats were thickened, and indurated; and inter- nally they were, in many* places, of a yellow colour, and exhibited the usual signs of incipient ossifica- tion. The coats of the descending aorta, indeed, did contain some bony laminae ; and as this vessel approached the diaphragm it was figured with longitudinal furrows, which could not be effaced by pulling the sides in opposite directions. This appearance I have observed in other subjects, and shall speak of it hereafter.â€”Morgagni, xviii. 34. d d

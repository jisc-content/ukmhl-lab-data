248 Case 5. Ulceration of the larynx. A woman forty years of age, had long been asthmatic. She also had purulent expectoration, and a sense of erosion in the larynx, in combina- tion with weakened powers of voice; and was supposed by her physician to be the subject of pul- monary disease. At length, in the year 1704, she was seized with an urgent paroxysm of asthma, and died suddenly. Dissection. To the astonishment of those who were present, no disease was found in the abdomen, thorax, or head. At that time it was not usual to open the larynx in public demonstrations, but I suggested to Valsalva that the disease might be lurking there. This organ was then opened, and the object of our inquiry discovered. Pus of a somewhat cineritious colour, and of a pultaceous consistence, formed into the shape of a cork, closed the cavity of the larynx below the glottis. The investing mucous membrane at that part was in a state of ulceration; and it was slightly ulcerated also where it lined the adjacent rings of the trachea. The discovery of this seat of the disease, afforded great satisfaction to all the persons who attended the public dissection.*â€”31orgagni, xv. 13. * In a case of ulcerated larynx, recently under my care, the most distressing circumstance during the disease was an inability to swallow liquids without a sense of suffocation, and most acute pain being induced. Persons whose misfortune it is to labour under ulceration of the epiglottis, or who have tumours of the larynx or pharynx, are often called to undergo extreme suffering.

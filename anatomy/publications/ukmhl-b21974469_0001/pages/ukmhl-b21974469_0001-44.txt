The coats of the bladder, and the urine it contained, were of a yellow colour. In the left cavity of the thorax there was a considerable quantity of yellowish serum; and por- tions of lymph were concreted upon the surface of the lungs; the inferior lobe was almost entirely indurated; when cut into, its structure was nearly as compact as liver, which evidently arose from inflammation ; in some parts suppuration had com- menced. The pericardium contained a small quantity of yellowish serum, and its vessels were turgid with blood. The upper part of the pleura was thickened. The vessels of the pia mater, on the left side, were greatly distended with blood. There were some hydatids on the choroid plexuses; on the surface of the brain a large quantity of serous fluid was deposited, and a small quantity in the ven- tricles.â€”Morgagni, vii. 11.

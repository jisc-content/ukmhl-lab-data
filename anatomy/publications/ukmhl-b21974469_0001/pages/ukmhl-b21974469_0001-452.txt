412 cavities of the heart were distended with blood, and were somewhat more capacious than usual, especially the left auricle. The pulmonary artery and the aorta exceeded their ordinary diameter, and the whole of the valves were enlarged. Nearly all these circumstances, however, were in rela- tive proportions. In the larger valvula mitralis there was a small semilunar orifice, through which the probe ascended, betwixt the membranes of the valve, to the extent of about a line. It is probable that this was not the result of disease, for I have more than once observed a small disjunction of membranes in the valves of the heart, and supposed it to be congenital. When the aorta was opened from the heart to the diaphragm, some obscure longitudinal lines were observable, extending from the heart to the curvature of the aorta; and at the curvature an opaque spot existed. The internal coat, when pressed with the finger or scratched with the nail, might easily be tom off in large pieces. The bronchia contained frothy mucus, which in some places was bloody, and in others the mucus presented the appearance of pus. The brain was in a state of sanguineous plethora. I entertained no doubt that there had been effusion of serum into the abdomen, but there was no time to open this cavity, nor did I think it necessary. Morgagni, xxiii. 6.

510 in the mitral valves, after intermission of the pulse: and the former of these anatomists, after that symptom, found a kind of putrid humour in the pericardium, and the heart was enlarged to double its natural size. Cowper and Yieussens generally found ossification of the valves, and dilatation of the left ventricle, when the fatal catastrophe had been preceded by an intermittent or unequal pulse.—21. Irregularity of the pulse has been ascribed, in a great measure, to polypi; but the writings of Pasta are sufficient to induce a doubt whether polypi are ever formed in living bodies, except in cases of aneurism. I believe, however, that they may begin to form in dying persons, or during very protracted syncope: but we have already spoken on this subject.—30. Sometimes there exists an extraordinary slowness of pulse. An instance of this nature has been related.* In another old man, who had been attacked with epileptic paroxysms, which com* menced in an abdominal affection, I found the pulsations only amounted to two and twenty in a minute, and this sluggishness had existed for several months, though the man was able to walk about like a healthy person.

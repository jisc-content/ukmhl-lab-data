The hymen was entire, and the uterus was per- fectly natural, although the cavity of this organ abounded with a somewhat glutinous secretion, which resembled water in which fresh meat has been washed. When this was wiped away, and a little pressure made with the fingers, some bloody points appeared on the inner surface, but chiefly in the middle of the fundus uteri; and on the pressure being increased they became small drops of blood. In different parts of this surface there was an appearance of sinuses turgid with blood ; so that I had no doubt these were the indications of approaching men- struation. Whilst dissecting the thorax I made incisions into the expanding mammae, and was surprised when, at several points, milk burst from them with a degree of impetus. As soon as the scalpel had punctured the chest, fluid having a bluish tint issued from the cavity, and the thorax was disco- vered to be filled with it. When the fluid had been removed I found that only a portion of the left lung, at its posterior surface, adhered to the pleura; but the right lung was closely united to that membrane through the whole of its posterior and lateral surfaces. The pericardium was ren- dered so exceedingly tense by the fluid it con- tained, that, previous to cutting into that capsule, I supposed that the heart must be exceedingly

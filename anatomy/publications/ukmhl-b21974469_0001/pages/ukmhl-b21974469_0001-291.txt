Though pressure from behind more readily obstructs the trachea than when it is made ante- riorly, because the posterior surface is not defended by cartilage; yet if the anterior part is powerfully compressed, not only may difficult respiration ensue, but even death. This has actually occurred from sarcomatous tumours ; and Christian Vater has related an instance in which it happened from the thymus gland being enlarged and filled with calca- rious matter.—16.

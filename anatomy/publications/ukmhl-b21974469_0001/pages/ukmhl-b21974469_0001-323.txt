The right lung appeared exceedingly turgid, and was loosely adherent to the pleura through the medium of a kind of membrane of coagulable lymph. Indeed this adventitious mem- brane so much resembled the pleura when in a sloughing state, that I was persuaded the appear- ance might easily occasion deception, as it really did to Riverius in a case of pleurisy. In the present instance, however, the pleura was perfectly healthy; but the posterior part of this lung was inflamed and greatly indurated. No morbid ap- pearances were discovered on the left side except adhesion between the pleura. The pericardium was distended with serum.— Valsalva, xx. 59.

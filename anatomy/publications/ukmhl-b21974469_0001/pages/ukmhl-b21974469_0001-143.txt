Slight delirium, conjoined with acute fever, supervened; but during the two or three days immediately preceding death, she was perfectly rational. Dissection. There was no appearance of injury in the skull or membranes which could be ascribed to the fall, nor were the vessels of the latter turgid. The anterior third part of the left hemisphere of the cerebrum was much lower than the corres- ponding part of the opposite hemisphere, and considerably softer in texture throughout its sub- stance. This was evident in the cortical substance, but much more so in the medullary, which presented the appearance of a semi-transparent jelly, having a brownish-cineritious colour. It did not exhale an offensive odour; nor was there either pus or extra- vasated blood. It seemed to be disease of a peculiar character.—Morgagni, ix. 16. It might be doubted whether the origin of this disease should be traced to the injury from the fall, or whether it had previously existed and was the occasion of the epilepsy; the appearances on dis- section and the analogy which it sustains with other instances, confirm the latter opinion. No other part of the body was examined except the organs of generation.—17. Case 7. Epilepsy from disease in the cerebrum. A short and slender man, who had previously been the subject of epilepsy, was carried off in a

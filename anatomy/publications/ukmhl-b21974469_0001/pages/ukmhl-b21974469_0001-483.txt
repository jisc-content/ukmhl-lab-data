443 Case 4. Ossification of the aorta and coronary arteries; mal- position of the gall-bladder; biliary calculi. In an emaciated old man, whose body I dissected in December 1743, the pulse had been small and feeble, but not intermittent, when, in consequence of a strangulated hernia, he was brought into the hospital at Padua. Though I could not ascertain satisfactorily whether the pulse had been in that state previous to the coming on of this disease, or whether it was brought on by the disease, in conjunc- tion with enteritis, yet the appearances observed on dissection render the case worthy of recital. Dissection. On examining the external surface of the heart, the left coronary artery appeared to have been converted into a complete bony canal, from its origin to the breadth of several fingers, where it embraces the greater part of the basis of the heart: and that branch which it gives off upon the anterior part of the heart was ossified to the extent of three digits. The ossification was un- equal, so that it resembled the knots of a slender reed. The tubercles of the aortic valves were indurated and almost bony. The internal surface of the aorta, from the origin of the upper arteries to the bifurcation of the aorta into the iliacs, was rendered uneven by bony lamellae, many of which were equal in size to a manâ€™s thumb-nail. Yet I found the thin inner tunic of the artery, by which all these ossifications were covered, to be injured only in one place, at which a thickish matter had been secreted. There were bony scales, likewise, in the subclavian, carotid, splenic, and iliac arteries; but

95 The stupor and semi-paralysis may be ascribed to the softened condition of the cerebrum.* Morgagni, xi, 22. Case 9. Paralysis from disease in the corresponding side of the cerebrum. In general when paralysis arises from a morbid condition of the brain the lesion is discovered on the opposite side: this, however, does not invariably happen. An old woman, the mother of a numerous family, having undergone apoplexy, was left with paralysis in the upper and lower limb of the right side, when the symptoms characteristic of the preceding dis- ease had subsided. She could move them very slightly, but retained the sense of feeling. At the expiration of three months, drowsiness accom- panied with considerable hesitation of speech, supervened. She was brought into the hospital, where life gradually became extinct. Dissection. The uterus was so remarkably small that its length, from the external part of the mouth of that organ to the upper part of the fundus, was scarcely equal to the breadth of two fingers ; it was proportionately contracted in its other dimensions, and its substance did not present a healthy ap- pearance, but was of a livid colour. One of its tubes was not only impervious but adherent to the ovarium: the ovary was comparatively hard, and had a sort of chequered surface. * Observations on flaccidity of the brain are subjoined to the section on insanity.â€” Ed.

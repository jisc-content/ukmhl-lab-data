212 Between the dura mater and cranium a small quantity of a secretion which resembled jelly was deposited; and the whole of the corresponding hemisphere of the cerebrum, quite to the lateral ventricle, was of a greenish black colour, and exhaled a putrescent odour. The anterior part of this ventricle was dilated to such a degree as to contain, without laceration, as much coagulated blood as was equal to a mans fist. The remain- ing part of this, and the whole of the left cavity, were occupied with bloody serum. Morgagni, lii. 23. It is most probable that some vessel of the choroid plexus, or of the parietes of the ventricle, had been slightly ruptured at the time of the casualty, and that the ventricle was expanded, without the me- dullary substance being torn, by the effusion of blood being very gradual. Had it been suddenly extravasated, it is likely that death would have ensued much earlier. The continuance of health from the fourth to the seventeenth day, should not be adduced as an objection to the conjecture that the bursting of the vessel was coeval with the accident; because even a protracted immunity is not incompatible with very slow effusion into the brain. We may suppose, from the sphacelated state of that organ, that a morbid condition of its sub- stance had preexisted. It happens not very rarely, that in the most important lesions of the brain, either there is no symptom of it, or the indications are but very slight, for a much longer period than in the preceding instance.â€”24.

528 appearance like ecchymosis, and the blood extra* vasated here was of a crimson hue. The left lung, at its upper and lateral parts, was firmly annexed to the pleura, which in those places, and also the pleuritic covering of the subjacent diaphragm, and of the anterior part of the mediastinum, was not only beset with round bodies similar to those which pervaded the peritoneum, but the membrane had acquired a degree of hardness and thickness which exceeded the density of the coats of the aorta at its origin. The internal texture of the pleura consisted of a white substance, made up of minute particles. When the lungs were com- pressed they were observed to be full of frothy ichor. The pericardium scarcely contained more fluid than is usually found in that bag, but the fluid exhibited the same appearance with that which occupied the other cavities.â€”Morgagni, xvi. 30. It is difficult to determine the cause of the appearances which presented themselves in the pleura. Hippocrates and Galen entertained the opinion, that serous fluid may be accumulated in the thorax and pericardium from ruptured hydatids, which had been observed in the ox, the dog, and the sow ; and from their existence in these animals it was inferred that the human body was liable to them, in a ratio of increase proportionate with its greater tendency to disease. To these ruptured hydatids Hippocrates attached the appellation of tubercles. It is well known that similar appearances are often seen in sheep and oxen. They have fallen under my observation in brutes and in the human subject. In a sow that was, in other

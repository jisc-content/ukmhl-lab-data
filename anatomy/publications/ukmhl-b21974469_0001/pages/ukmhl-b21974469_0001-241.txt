201 not result from the injury, the state of the head only will be mentioned. Though the cranium was entire, yet pus was seated between it and the dura mater; and this membrane appeared to be affected with sphacelus.â€”Morgagni, lii. 4. Case 8. Deposition of pus and serum; the dura mater thickened. A woman had two wounds inflicted upon the side of her head by a cutting instrument. They had nearly cicatrized when she exposed herself to the agency of a cold atmosphere; and having dis- turbed the wounded temporal muscle by the mas- tication of hard food, the whole face became swollen. She then had rigors, and convulsive motions in the head, with occasional slight deli- rium; and at length respiration became stertorous, and death ensued. Dissection. The dura mater was thickened; and in different parts of it there were red marks which appeared like drops of blood, but they could not be wiped off. A small quantity of pus was depo- sited between the membranes, under the right anterior lobe of the cerebrum. The vessels of the pia mater were turgid; and beneath this membrane, and also in the ventricles, there was a small quan- tity of serous fluid, which in the cavities had a reddish tinge. The bone was denuded, and a small foramen allowed a probe to pass through it into the orbit, but the aperture did not commu- nicate with the cavity of the cranium. Morgagni, lii. (>.

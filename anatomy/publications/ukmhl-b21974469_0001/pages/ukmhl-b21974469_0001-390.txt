The pericardium has often been found thickened to a considerable extent; and the symptoms have been modified by the co-existent, disease. Hottin- ger found it thick like buff leather, very hard, and closely adherent to the heart. The only symptom was a difficulty of breathing. Laubius found it as thick as a man’s thumb, and as hard as cartilage, whilst the heart itself was small. The symptoms were those of violent asthma*—xxiii. 18.

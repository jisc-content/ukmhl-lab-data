192 fracture or fissure. For the sake of order I have arranged them under seven subdivisions ; namely, injuries without fracture, injuries with fracture of the external table, injuries with fracture of both tables, fractures with injury to the substance of the brain, fractures in the basis of the cranium, disjunc- tion of the sutures, and injury of the diploe. Cases of injury to the medulla spinalis will be appended. Ed. Injuries of the head without fracture. Case 1. Deposition of pus between the membranes of the brain. A youth, sixteen years of age, was struck with a stone on the left parietal bone near the lambdoidal suture. Nothing worthy of notice ensued till about the seventh or eighth day, when the lips of the wound began to swell. On the eleventh day fever discovered itself, with rigors and vomiting, but unaccompanied with pain in the head. He was subsequently affected with convulsions and aphonia, and also became deaf and blind. He died on the fourteenth day. of being unable to open his mouth. The hemorrhage com- menced in the nasal cavity nearest to the enlarged gland, but it afterwards took place from both nostrils. He was extensively afflicted with gout, and had indications of hepatic disorganization; but the immediate cause of death was the repeated effusion of blood. The hemorrhagic action was not so extensively manifest as in the preceding case; but when there was feebleness in the radial artery and the extremities were cold, the patient was conscious of a strongly irritative throbbing in the arteries rami- fying through the nose and the circumjacent parts.â€” Ed.

161 SECTION XII. Diseases of the Eyes. Amaurosis. Sometimes amaurosis has originated from con- vulsions, and has disappeared on their cessation. It has ensued from a wound above the supercilia, in consequence of injury done to the ophthalmic branch of the fifth pair of nerves as it passes out from the orbit. The optic nerves have been com- pressed, and amaurosis produced, by a turgid state of the vessels which internally and externally accompany the substance of these nerves. It is supposed that to this cause are to be referred those cases of amaurosis which succeed phrenitis and similar affections of the head, and those in- stances of women, recorded by Rolfinc, who as often as they were pregnant were always blind till the time of delivery. It has also arisen from disease and extenuation of the nerve. Compression of the nerves and consequent amaurosis have likewise been occasioned by strumous and other tumours, as well as by hydatids, and hydrocephalus. A fungous excrescence has also been found upon the point of union of the optic nerves, and from this cause blindness resulted. It sometimes happens that when disease has arisen in one of the optic nerves, both eyes have been affected, but this is not a necessary conse- quence. We have no proof that there is any com- mixture or decussation of substance where the nerves unite. Vesalius and others have found the nerves separate in their whole course. Santorini M

78 A considerable quantity of serous fluid escaped from the cavity of the cranium whilst we were sawing through the skull. The dura mater was thickened; the vessels of the pia mater were greatly distended with blood ; and beneath this membrane a transparent fluid was observed in the convolu- tions of the brain; the lateral ventricles contained a similar fluid; and the choroid plexuses were vesiculated—one of the vesicles being nearly as large as a small grape. When the choroid plexus was raised up, the left thalamus nervi optici was observed to be of an unusually brown colour ; the circumjacent medullary substance was soft, indeed almost liquified, and commixed with a bloody fluid, to an extent exceeding that of the largest sized walnut. The structure of the cerebrum in general was extremely firm.—Morgagni, v. 6. The cerebral lesion, in this instance, happened about that part in which my observations lead me to believe that organic diseases most frequently occur. We are reminded by the inflammation and dis- tension of the bladder of the great importance of protecting apoplectic patients from an accession of new diseases, arising from retention of urine—a circumstance very liable to happen in protracted cases. Nor are we to be satisfied by a stillicidium urinae, for this may continue through weakness of the sphincter, whilst the bladder remains greatly distended; and the wetted bedclothes will have a tendency to mislead the attendants. It is incum- bent on physicians, therefore, to examine the lower region of the abdomen occasionally, so that if there

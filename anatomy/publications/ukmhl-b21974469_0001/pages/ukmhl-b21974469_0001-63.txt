23 canal, and should this exceed the natural quantity, it may be considered as an occasion of hydro- rachitis. The spine has been bifid in the neck and back at the same time. When the tumour arising* from spina bifida has appeared in the lumbar region, the nerves of the cauda equina have sometimes been irregularly distributed through the tumour. It has been maintained that this affection of the spine was attributable to water deposited in the cellular structure surrounding the dura mater; it might, occasionally, be seated in that part, for sometimes, though very rarely, a recovery has ensued from puncturing the tumour. In a case described by Hoffman the disease seemed to originate from injury received during a difficult birth; the tumour began to appear in the loins, where the chief injury had been sustained, a few days afterwards. It has already been observed that the cauda equina does not descend to the os coccygis, which circumstance will probably ex- plain the reason of the greater protraction of life, which Ruysch observed, when the tumour was seated on this part. In such cases so many nerves are not protruded or injured, as in other cases; in consequence of which there is less probability of paralysis of the lower limbs, of the sphincter ani, and of the bladder, which in them is likely to happen. The life of the little patient, however, is usually cut short by convulsions and other consequences, of injury to the nerves ; and these evils happen more speedily, if the nerves are pricked in opening the tumour, or if they are exposed to the contact of air.

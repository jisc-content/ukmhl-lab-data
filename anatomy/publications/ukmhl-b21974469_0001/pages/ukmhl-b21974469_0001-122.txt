82 Dissection. The abdomen was tumid from gas, with which the stomach and intestines were inflated. The veins which flow into the gastro- epiploic were so extremely turgid as to redden the coats of the former viscus, and the trunk of the gastro-epiploicae, which in this body was single, was so dilated and tumid as to equal the size of my forefinger, but immediately on being cut into, it contracted; for it contained a large quantity of air, with a little frothy blood of a black colour. Some parts of the convex surface of the liver were of a dark colour; the gall bladder contained bile that was nearly black, and in this bile there was a calculus which, in its magnitude, colour, and granulated surface, resembled a mulberry : when held over burning wax it did not inflame. The spleen was large but not lax in its texture; the pancreas was somewhat indurated, and the abdo- minal cavity contained some bloody fluid. The small intestines, to the extent of a span, were red, and for the space of three digits (a portion which was incarcerated in a hernial sac) they had a gan- grenous appearance, though the coats were firm. The pericardium and heart were so closely united together that they could not be dissevered without laceration. The heart was large and flaccid; and both of the ventricles, and the right auricle, con- tained frothy blood. In every part which we inspected, all the veins were distended with black and frothy blood, and a portion was found in the aorta and in the carotid arteries. The trunk of the pulmonary artery was exceedingly turgid with this mixture of blood and gas. The lungs were in a

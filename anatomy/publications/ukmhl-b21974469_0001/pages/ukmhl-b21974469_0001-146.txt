106 Case 9. Epilepsy from abscess and other lesions in the cere- brum, with caries of the skull; from the venereal disease. A woman who had two syphilitic tumours on her forehead took mercury until a ptialism was excited. The left tumour disappeared, but in the place of it a pulsating protuberance arose. Before the use of mercury she had been subject to epilepsy; she had an epileptic attack once during the treat- ment ; and when the tumour had subsided she was harrassed with convulsions. She lay in a state of coma for some days before death, which happened about the middle of October 1739. Dissection. The pulsating tumour of the forehead was found to be the brain, which instead of being covered in this part with its proper meninges, was covered with a membrane as thick as pasteboard, but so flaccid as to be easily torn between the fingers; and the cortical substance beneath it was as firm as the texture of liver. The remainder of the left hemisphere, except the posterior part, was much softer than it ought to have been, and within it was a cavity the size of a small walnut surrounded by soft and livid parietes of medullary substance, which contained a liquid in which fila- ments were suspended; part of which was of a dark colour, and the rest was like serum. It neither communicated with the tumour on the fore- head nor with the ventricle. It was near the latter, and about two digits from the former. On the right side the bone was not completely perforated. Morgagni, ix. 23.

244 If the stomach or contiguous intestines are inflated with gas, the distension will prove an impediment to the descent of the diaphragm in the act of inspi- ration. This effect will also be produced by an enlarged liver; and the augmented weight of this viscus will also impede the ascent of the septum, to which it adheres. Nor are examples wanting of dyspnoea from the enlargement of other viscera.â€”11. The following case, in which asthmatic symptoms were occasioned by a diseased pancreas, was re- lated to me by Albertini. Case 3. A person at Genoa was afflicted with asthma, and his physicians entertained no doubt that the cause existed in the thorax. When Albertini was con- sulted, he suspected that it originated from lesion in some abdominal viscus near the diaphragm. At length the patient died, and, on examination, the pancreas was found to be the seat of tumours having the form of apples and inclining to the nature of carcinoma. The cases of this description which have occurred to Valsalva and to me will be adduced in another part of this work, and amongst them some will be recorded in which the utmost difficulty of respi- ration was consequent upon an apparently slight disease of the stomach. Physicians do not sufficiently bear in mind the circumstance, that the upper part of the abdomen and consequently its higher viscera ascend high within the chest, and consequently those symptoms

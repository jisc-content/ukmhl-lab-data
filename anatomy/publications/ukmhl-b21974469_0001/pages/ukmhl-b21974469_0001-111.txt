71 Case 15. Apoplexy from deposition of serum, and turgescence of vessels, with discolouration of the medullary substance.

The most remarkable circumstance, however, was that the whole medullary substance of the right hemisphere was of an exceedingly brown colour, but not the left .â€”Morgagni, v. 15. A considerable quantity of serous fluid is some- times deposited, as in cases of hydrocephalus, without producing apoplectic symptoms, one of which I shall adduce here as an example Case 16. Effusion of serum, without either apoplectic, or the usual hydrocephalic symptoms. An old man, nearly an octogenarian, the surface of whose body was almost covered with filthy pustules,

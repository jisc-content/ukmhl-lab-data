When this fluid was placed on the fire it deposited a thick matter, but totally evaporated. The fluid which was taken from the abdomen and thorax, being exposed to the action of heat, became turbid, and then passed off in vapour, leaving no residue except a somewhat glutinous pellicle.â€” Valsalva, xvi. 10.

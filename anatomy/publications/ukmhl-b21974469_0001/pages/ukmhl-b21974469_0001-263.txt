Whilst dividing the dura mater, after the removal of the calvarium, there was a copious efflux of blood. The wound had perforated the longitudinal sinus, and reached from thence into the left ventricle.* This cavity contained a serous fluid and grumous blood, and its floor was in a state of ulceration. There was considerable accumulation of blood in the left lobe of the lungs.— Valsalva, li. 54. In the following instance of cerebral lesion, some days elapsed before any perilous consequences were manifested. Case 5. A man thirty years of age, and of a bilious tem- perament, was struck with an acutely pointed instrument above the right eye. During three days he had no perceptible derangement of the animal functions.

It was also disco- vered that the instrument had passed between the eye and the orbit, and had actually perforated this arch, and then passed through the cerebral * Morgagni suspected that some inaccuracy had been com- mitted by Valsalva, and that he had inserted left instead of right ventricle. The circumstances warrant this suspicion.—Ed.

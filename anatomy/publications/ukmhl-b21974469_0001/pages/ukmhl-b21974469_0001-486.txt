446 ulcerated and ossified tract was distinguished by a thickish and bloody humour, which adhered to it as it escaped from the ulcerated parts. From these circumstances I do not doubt that bony squamae are often formed after inflammation and suppuration; but they sometimes originate without any preceding inflammation, or, at least, without previous suppuration. In the eighteenth epistle a case is recorded, in which the aorta, from the heart to the origin of the arteries from its arch, was of an intermediate nature between ligament and car- tilage, so that it could scarcely be cut into; and had the man lived it would have become bony: he could not have laboured under inflammation and suppuration to such an extent, without any symptoms of acute disease being observable. May we not suppose that in many of the bodies in which I found ulceration of the artery, that the ulceration had not always, and perhaps not often, preceded the formation of the bony scales, but had rather been the consequence of irritation from their prominencies and asperities ? Morgagni, xxvii. 22, 24. But though ulceration of the aorta is more frequently met with when the coats are ossified, yet even then it certainly is not wholly attributable to irritation, for at times there is neither inequality nor roughness in the bones, though ulceration exists; and we have already shown, that ulceration occa- sionally takes place when the parietes of the vessel are exempt from ossification.â€”25. The opaque spots which are the rudiments of ossification are usually situated in the cellular

107 Some doubt may be entertained whether the abscess in the cerebrum originated in the syphilitic affection, but it cannot justly be questioned that the indurated state of the cerebrum arose from that cause. The cortical substance of the brain has been found partially indurated, and even scirrhous in other cases of epilepsy. In a seaman who had been the subject of this morbus comitialis for a long period, the accessions of which at last were extremely severe, Kaavius found that the cortical substance of the brain was not only greatly indu- rated in every part but in many places scirrhous, and in others, especially towards the vertex, almost cartilaginous. In a case related to me by Walthieri, the cerebrum at the part near the crista galli was callous, and intimately connected with the dura mater. By other anatomists an abscess has been discovered in the brain after epilepsy.â€”24. Epilepsy from ossification of the dura mater. The dura mater has been found ossified, or spiculae of bone have been formed upon that membrane in epilepsia. In a woman who had long been subject to its attacks, and who died from injury of the head without fracture, a bony prominence was found in the falx. In the head of a young man, who had been epileptic for a long time, exceedingly small spiculae of bone were discovered; their bases were connected with the dura mater, and their very acute apices directed against the pia mater. Experiments upon the dura mater have apparently led to differences of result.

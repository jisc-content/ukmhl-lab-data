69 and in the membrane of the lateral ventricles, were turgid with blood. The medullary substance of the brain was of a brown colour, a circumstance I might have attributed to the quantity of blood, if in other instances I had not seen a greater excess and more numerous vessels, whilst the medullary structure retained its natural whiteness. There was a considerable quantity of fluid in the ven- tricles, and in the vertebral canal. There was no obvious lesion in the cerebrum or cerebellum that related to the previous hemicrania. The root of the aorta was unequal externally, and internally was rugous, with slight appearances of ossification. I believe the disease in the aorta contributed to the production of apoplexy, and probably occasioned the pain beneath the sternum.—Morgagni, iv. 21. There is naturally some moisture in the ventricles of the brain, but whenever a little is mentioned as having existed in an apoplectic person, I am per- suaded there was a superfluity; and a very small portion deposited suddenly, or within a short period, may occasion dangerous compression of the brain.—i. 29. It will be observed from the preceding histories that the progress of serous apoplexy varies under different circumstances. The nature of the effused fluid—the distension of vessels—the augmented power of the arteries—the diminished capacity of the cranium from any morbid cause, as the exist- ence of tumours—and the degree of complication with disease in other organs, tend to produce this diversity.—32. There are some anatomists who will not admit

404 Having opened the thorax, I discovered a few ounces of very bloody serum in both cavities. The texture of the lungs was healthy, but the bronchia, especially on the left side, were pervaded with a fluid resembling that which occupied the cavities. The pericardium contained somewhat less than a pound of blood, about two ounces of which con- sisted of bloody serum, and the remainder was a firmly coagulated lamina. The blood in other parts of the body was fluid. The aorta was dilated from its origin to near the part at which the renal arteries branch off, and the arteria innominata, as well as the carotid and subclavian artery proceed- ing from it, were so expanded that the carotid, from its commencement to the bifurcation was double its usual diameter The subclavian, w hich was dilated to the extent of three digits, was not expanded equally in its circumference, but had only its poste- rior and upper paries curved out into a prominent aneurism, by which two or three of the nerves which pass from the neck to the arm, were compressed. From this aneurism, which would have admitted my thumb, two arteries proceeded, which having an unnaturally broad commencement presented the form of a cone for the extent of a digit and a half, when they regained their usual dimensions. One of these vessels was distributed to the thyroid gland, which was large and indurated in places. Within the iliac arteries, I found no appearance of disease except opaque spots, and some minute furrows. From the renal arteries upwards, the parietes of the aorta were harder and more rigid than usual, and considerably thickened, though not in an equal

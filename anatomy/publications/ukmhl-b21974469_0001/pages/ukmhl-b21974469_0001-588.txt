548 from the rupture of lymphatics, or from the bursting of hydatids; for most anatomists have seen hyda- tids within the pericardium, and upon the surface of the heart, in the human subject as well as in brutes. I advert to these sources to show, that hydrothorax may vary in its origin as well as in its symptoms.â€”44. In reference to the symptoms I might state that Albertini found the pulse small and rather fre- quent, especially when the largest quantity of fluid had been effused. If we compare most of the symptoms which have been recorded by learned men with the cases which have been narrated or alluded to by me, we shall discover that some of those signs are not constant, and others are not even of frequent occurrence. Swoonings have not been more common, according to my observations, in dropsy of the pericardium than in hydrothorax. A dry short cough, which was generally supposed to be more troublesome in cases of effusion into the pericardium than in effusions into the thoracic cavity, I think is more common in the latter than in the former, in consequence of the contiguity of the fluid to the phrenic nerves, to the lungs, and to the whole surface of the pleura. If fluids secreted into the pericardium are of an irritating nature, they certainly may excite the annexed diaphragm into sympathetic action, although this is not so likely to happen as when the fluid pervades the thoracic cavities, and consequently may act upon the diaphragm through a much more extended space. The difficulty of respiration, I think, is less in hydrops pericardii than in

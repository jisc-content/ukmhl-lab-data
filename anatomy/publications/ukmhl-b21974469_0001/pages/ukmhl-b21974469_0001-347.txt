This event, however, was preceded by the discharge of a humour from the mouth like frothy water tinged with blood. I examined the body on the following day, namely, the eighteenth of March 1706. Dissection. The lungs adhered to the diaphragm, and, indeed, to all the parietes of the thorax. In some places this adhesion was effected by the intervension of membranes, but in most parts, especially at the sides and back, the pleurae were in immediate union ; and in those places the costal pleura was somewhat thickened, and easily divi- sible into two laminae. The upper lobe of the left lung was indurated, and of an hepatic compactness of texture, and of a pale colour. The remaining lobes of the lungs retained their natural structure; but they were distended with a frothy mucus; and indeed from some of the ramifications of the bron- chia, a white matter issued, when these air-tubes were dividedâ€”matter that was in every respect like pus. In the trachea, and larger trunks of the bronchia, there appeared some greyish concretions, and some of the same concreted substance remained on the tongue. From the orifices of the mucous glands, situated at the posterior part of these tubes, I squeezed out a whitish and somewhat thick matter; and some of the larger glands, at the bifur- cation at the trachea, were not in a healthy state. A considerable quantity of coagulable lymph was thrown out between the lobuli of the lungs. The x 2

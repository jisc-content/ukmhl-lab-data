222 Case 3. A man was received into the hospital in conse- quence of having been wounded with a cutting instrument on the anterior and also on the posterior part of the head, on the left side. On the fourth day he began to complain of extremely violent pain in the loins, and within a few days the pain extended over the whole body. On the sixteenth day he was seized with aphonia, and afterwards experienced a total abolition of the mental faculties. He died on the twenty-fifth day. Dissection. The anterior wound penetrated to the beginning of the medullary substance of the brain, and the posterior had transpierced the cere- brum quite to the left lateral ventricle. That ventricle contained a considerable excess of serous fluid; and when this fluid was brought into contact with the tongue, it produced a biting sensation that was of long continuance.— Valsalva, li. 53. Case 4. A husbandman, forty years of age, was struck on the right side of the sagittal suture with a bill, the beak of which penetrated the cerebrum. The whole body was immediately seized with trembling, and the intellectual functions were retarded. Through the whole of the left side of the body the power of motion was diminished, and on the fourth day entirely destroyed; but sensibility continued. The man’s face was florid, his respiration op- pressed, and his pulse languid. At length a reddish matter was emitted from the bone, and death occurred on the seventh day.

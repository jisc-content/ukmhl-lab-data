166 greater disease in it than really existed. The tunica sclerotica was contracted and thickened, and the choroid coat adhered to it more closely than usual. Subjacent to the choroides was a thick, firm, and whitish membrane which proceeded forwards, and covered that part of the eye where the corona ciliaris and crystalline humour are usually situated. It was doubtful whether this had been the retina, or the membrana hyaloidea, or both together, previous to its becoming so thick. In this eye, however, there was neither crystalline nor vitreous humour, but only a few drops of a turbid and brown fluid. Adjacent to the natural situation of the lens I found a small hard body, not differing much in its magnitude and figure from the lens, though a little larger. It was convex anteriorly, and concave posteriorly, so as to exhibit a miniature representation of a shield, and principally consisted of a moderately thick, but not a continued osseous lamina. Part of the remains of the uvea adhered very closely to the anterior surface of this body, whilst the concave surface was invested by the white membrane already described. When the optic nerve was traced, it was observed to be more slender than the right, more compact in substance, and of a brownish colour, from the eye to the point of coalition. The right did not deviate from its usual appearance; and indeed from the point of union both were equally natural.—Morgagni, xiii. 9. It was not easy to determine whether this small bone was formed by ossification of the anterior surface of the crystalline humour, or of its cap- sule.—10.

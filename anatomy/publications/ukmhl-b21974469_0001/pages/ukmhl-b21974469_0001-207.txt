167 Case 4. Partial absorption of the crystalline humour in situ. The eye of an aged woman was brought to me during the public demonstrations of 1747. Its figure was not so spherical as is natural to that organ; and as the greater part of the cornea was opaque from white spots, it was evident that she had been blind in this eye. The tunica choroides adhered more closely to the sclerotica than usual, particularly at the posterior part. The anterior surface of the crystalline humour was unequally excavated in the middle, and that to a considerable depth; the remainder of the humour might be con- sidered. as of a sound texture for the woman’s age, though when held towards the light it resembled yellow amber. The iris was partially adherent to the cornea, but most intimately at the centre, where the cornea was unequal, and one of its lamellae was beginning to separate. Morgagni, lxiii. 2. Case 5. Dislocation of the crystalline humour and its absorp- tion in the anterior chamber, with disease in the retina and optic nerve. The cornea of a man’s eye had long been opaque, and there were slight but unequivocal traces of a double cicatrix upon it. The crystalline humour was connected with the cornea: it was not hard, but so reduced in quantity that scarcely a fourth part of it remained. The uvea was not greatly diseased, but the vitreous humour and retina were

The parietes of this cavity were lacerated in some places, and opened, through the corpus striatum, into the left ventricle, by a foramen large enough to admit the point of a finger. The septum lucidum having been lacerated, both ventricles were filled with bloody serum. The vessels of the cerebellum were very turgid on the left side.â€”Morgagni, iii. 4. Case 11.

An old mendicant, who ate plentifully, (as persons of this profession generally do) and took but little exercise, was seized with apoplexy; he was insen- sible, and entirely lost the use of his tongue and left side. He died within three or four days. Dissection. Although before the head was opened, I had no information as to the immediate effects of the attack, yet from the appearance of a contusion on the left temporal muscle, which he received on falling, when he became apoplectic, I predicted that if the disease was from an apprecia- ble cause, it would be found on the opposite side of the brain.

431 lungs were in a Healthy state, but the pleurae were adherent at the lower and back part of the left lung. There was no appearance of disease in the trachea nor in the oesophagus, though opened quite to the stomach. Nor was any lesion discoverable in the mediastinum, or in the pericardium. The aorta seemed to be a little contracted, and the heart was somewhat enlarged. The corpuscula in the border of the aortic valves were harder and larger than usual, especially one of them. The whole internal coat of the aorta, from the heart to below the emulgent arteries, was evidently inclined to a slightly yellow colour, and had some inequality of surface. When attentively examined the ine^ quality appeared to consist of slight protuberances and depressions. In the vicinity of the emulgent arteries, the internal lamella of the aorta could be easily rubbed off by lightly applying the nail to it; and a little above the semilunar valves there was a narrow ulcer, where the fibres were displayed in a divided state. There was no induration of any part of the aorta, but the morbid appearances which have been described extended into some of the upper branches. There was a considerable quantity of fluid in the abdomen. The omentum was contracted ; the stomach was large, and full of humour; the liver was pale, and the gall-bladder contained a little discoloured bile. The spleen was indurated.â€”Morgagni, xxiii. 4. The disease induced in the upper part of the aorta, and in its superior branches, may be ac- counted for from those affections of the mind which have been mentioned, acting, through the nervous

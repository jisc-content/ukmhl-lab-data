236 Injuries of the spine. Case 1. Extravasation of blood into the spinal canal. A man, fifty years of age, who stooped in walking, was struck on the three lower vertebrae of the loins by a piece of wood which fell from a considerable height. He instantly dropped like a person half dead, and was brought into the hospital of St. Mary de Vita, where he died four hours after receiving the injury. Dissection. There was a considerable quantity of coagulated blood about the origin of the longis- simi dorsi and sacro-lumbales muscles. Within the vertebral canal at the part where the stroke had been given, there was a considerable quantity of coagulated blood, but the medulla spinalis itself appeared to be uninjured. There was no apparent visceral lesion; but the arteries, in which we are accustomed to find but little blood, were full of coagula.â€” Valsalva, liv. 25. Case 2. Fracture of one lumbar vertebra. Another man forty-six years of age, was struck on the back by a piece of timber. He lost the power of moving his legs, but the sense of feeling was retained. His faeces passed off involuntarily, and it was requisite for the urine to be drawn off by the catheter. Towards the close of life the urinary secretion was bloody. The patient complained of but little pain in the loins: he gradually sunk, however, and expired on the fourteenth day.

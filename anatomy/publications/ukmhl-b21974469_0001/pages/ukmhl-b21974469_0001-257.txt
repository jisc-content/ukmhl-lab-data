217 Dissection. The os fronds was slightly depressed; and an unequal and sharp lamina had been de- tached from its inner surface, and had wounded the dura mater, and consequently pus had formed betwixt that membrane and the pia mater, whence it had descended from the vertex nearly to the base of the cerebrum, and also to the bottom of the cere- bellum, on the corresponding side. — Valsalva, li.30. Case 5. Depression of the os frontis, and effusion of serum. A man, fifty years of age, having been wounded by a cutting instrument on the sinciput, imme- diately vomited. He was received into the hospital, and the bone was found to be so depressed that its elevation was impracticable. At first there was no pain in the wound, but after some days the man was conscious of a tingling sensation in it. The whole body was affected with convulsions on the eleventh day, and life became extinct. Dissection. The depressed portion of bone adhered very closely to the dura mater, which was slightly inflamed. Betwixt this membrane and the pia mater a thickish fluid was deposited, which in colour resembled serum.— Valsalva, li. 32. In other instances resembling this, vomiting was immediately consequent to the injury; and at the expiration of a few days fever came on, and the patients died lethargic, in consequence of the formation of pus between the membranes. But in some cases extravasation of blood occasioned a much more speedy termination of life.—Ed.

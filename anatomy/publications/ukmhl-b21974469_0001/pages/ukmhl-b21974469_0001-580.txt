540 exhibited a reddish appearance, and in one of these places, the canal appeared as if it had been dilated by force. The neck was tumid from an enlargement of the thyroid gland; and milk could easily be squeezed out of the mammae. The right cavity of the thorax contained a large quantity of a yellowish serous fluid, in which por- tions of coagulable lymph were suspended. There was a redundance of serum also in the left cavity, and the pericardium was nearly filled with a similar liquid, sustaining portions of lymph. Morgagni, xvi. 38. Case 16. Hydrothorax and hydrops pericardii, with effusion into the head. A man upwards of forty years of age, who frequently travelled on foot with goods from Imola to Bologna and back, was accustomed to drink when heated, and more particularly during the latter period of these exertions, when he expe- rienced constant thirst. At length he was seized with violent fever, accompanied with excessive secretion from the fauces, and was taken into the hospital at Bologna. The affection of the fauces soon disappeared, and then he referred to the abdomen as the seat of his disease; but he also complained of a violent pain in the lumbar portion of the spine, which, he said, felt as if it had been undergoing division.

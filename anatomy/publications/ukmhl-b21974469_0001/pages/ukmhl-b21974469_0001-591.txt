551 A case is recorded by Brunnerus, in which the pericardium was turgid with water, and the right cavity of the thorax was filled with a similar fluid ; and these effusions were complicated with ascites and enlargement of the liver. The patient com- plained of dyspnoea, and tightness about the prsecordia; and he was almost unable to breathe in the night, except in the erect position. His feet were cedematous, and he had a cough which gene- rally was unattended with expectoration. The abdomen and scrotum were tumid, and the whole body was somewhat swollen, but especially the right side, on which he generally lay. Where such complications exist, it is sometimes difficult to determine to which disease the symptoms refer.—46. A sense of constriction in the region of the heart is not unfrequently associated with dropsy of the pericardium, but, like the other symptoms, it is equivocal.—47. We must wait some time longer before we trephine the sternum, and perforate the peri- cardium— an operation remotely alluded to by Riolanus : for art has not yet sufficiently advanced to enable us so clearly to discover a redundance of serum in the pericardium, as to warrant such an enterprise.—48. However, by combining the symptoms which arise, we shall attain to considerable probability in discriminating hydrops pericardii. Senac, however, in his excellent treatise on diseases of the heart, has justly said, in rela- tion to this dropsical affection, that it is not

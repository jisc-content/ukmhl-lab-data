356 Lancisi found a large abscess occupying the base of the pericardium, and situated between its coats, which, on being opened, discharged a liquor of a melliceroid consistence. The man had laboured under palpitation of the heart, with oppressed respi- ration; and these symptoms were attributed to aneurism. Tumours have also been found in this membrane. In one case it was the seat of a tumour equal to the size of a small egg, and full of coagulated blood.*—Morgagni, xxiii. 19. Worms and air in the pericardium, In the course of my dissections I have never found either worms or air in the pericardium; but such cases are on record. However, I require more certain evidence of their existence, especially in relation to worms, than the testimony of the authors who have related such occurrences. Certainly I would not deny the possibility of a worm existing within the pericardium, as I have often found them within the coats of the aorta of dogs. The existence of air within the pericardium is more credible, * Dr. Baillie has described tumours of a scrofulous nature in the pericardium; and my friend Mr. Callaway has favoured me with an instance of fungoid disease. In a note to me he says, “ I find the disease was of the fungoid class, and attacking the “ pleuritic coverings of the heart only; but more particularly, the “ investing membrane of the pericardium. The disease had first “ attacked the pancreas, which presented one mass of that <( medullary substance to which the term fungus haematodes has “ been given. The tubercles found in the substance of the lungs “ presented a similar appearance. The viscera were generally healthy.”—Ed.

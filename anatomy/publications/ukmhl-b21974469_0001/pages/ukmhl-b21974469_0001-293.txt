253 brought forward in which there was consecutive suppuration, or effusion of serum; or in which there was a complication with other diseases.—Ed. Peripneumony terminating in consolidation of the pulmonary tissue. Case 1. A man forty years of age, who, for a long period, had been in the hospital of St. Mary de Vita, in consequence of a wound of the leg, was seized with cough and acute fever. The sputum was at first tinged with blood, but afterwards it was of a colour inclining to green. He had consider- able difficulty of respiration, and severe pain in the right side ; nevertheless he could lie easily on that side. About the fourth day from the commence- ment of active symptoms he died. Dissection. The upper lobe of the right lung, and the contiguous part of the adjoining lobe,, were tumid and greatly indurated, and also adhered closely to the pleura by interposing membranes. The pleura itself did not exhibit the least sign of inflammation.—Valsalva, xx. 3. Case 2. A man about sixty years of age, was seized with pain in the right side of his thorax, which was accompanied with fever, cough, and expec- toration. He could lie most easily on his back. The quantity of sputum had been considerable, but on the tenth day, after the loss of blood, expectoration ceased, and the man died.

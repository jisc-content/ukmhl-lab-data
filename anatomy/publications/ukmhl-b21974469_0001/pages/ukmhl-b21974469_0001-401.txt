361 The pulmonary artery itself has been found ossified.*—14. Ulceration of the heart. The governor of the city fortress was frequently attacked with pain in the region of the heart, and syncope ensued. He was under the cautious and assiduous management of Malpighi, and appeared likely to recover, when he was seized with acute fever, and died. * Rigidity and ossification in the valvular structures of the heart so frequently occur that it would be superfluous to mul- tiply instances. I have a specimen in which the left auriculo- ventricular aperture was surrounded by a rim of calcarious matter equal in thickness to the little finger. The heart had long been the seat of acute and pricking pain. The diverse indurations which take place in these parts do not appear to be different stages of one morbid process, but are quite distinct from each other. Corvisart says on this subject, “ the cartilaginous does not €t succeed the mucous or muscilaginous state; and osseous solidity “ does not gradually supersede cartilaginous firmness, but a “ deposite of osseous matter takes place quite independent of “ an anterior cartilaginous state.” “ Most authors” he adds “ have spoken of the ossification of the sero-fibrous parts of the “ heart, and have given to the effects of this alteration the “ denomination of stony; perhaps this is the most correct term “ for these concretions.” Of these concretions Mr. Hodgson has given an analysis with which he was favoured by Mr. Brand. They consisted of Phosphate of lime 65.5 Animal matter 34.5 100 The animal matter was chiefly albumen with a trace of gela- tine.—Ed.

The circumstance of dreading water whilst experiencing thirst must not be imputed to delirium; nor must it be supposed that all dread water, for some request it might be brought to them, and endeavour, though unsuccessfully, to drink. On some occasions the effort, though made with the utmost caution, has been attended with violent pain: in other instances convulsions have been produced; and it is known that instant suffo- cation has actually resulted. When persons have been asked why they did not drink, it has usually been ascribed to a sense of constriction of the fauces or throat. At the time that there is this inability to drink, solid food can often be swallowed without inconvenience.—Morgagni, viii. 19.

500 immediate abolition of sensibility and motion; and a few hours afterwards it became quite cold. No pulsation was perceptible till about the third day, but on the fifth day it had regained its usual strength. Towards the close of this day blood was discovered in the bed, and the bandages were found wet; but on their being cautiously removed, no blood was then flowing, nor was there any indication whence it had flowed. In consequence of this haemorrhage the pulsation was again lost, but the limb regained its natural temperature and motion a few days afterwards. A degree of weakness, however, remained for eight or nine months ; the limb wasted, the nails had a brown colour, and there was great susceptibility of injury from cold. At the termination of this period all the symptoms disappeared, and the pulse returned, although in a languid state.â€”Morgagni, 1. 7.

On examination after death the brachial artery was deficient for about two inches, where the aneurism had been situated. Only one artery could be discovered which kept up the communication between the trunk of the brachial artery and the radial and ulnar arteries. The communicating vessel was surprisingly tortuous, and so slender that it was difficult to conceive how the radial artery in this arm should have pulsated equally with that in the other arm, and by what means both arms had been equally nourished. The nerve, which seems to have been included in the

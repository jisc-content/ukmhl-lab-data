99 Dissection. Betwixt the dura and pia mater a serous fluid was universally deposited, and on one side there was a portion of extravasated blood. The ventricles were filled with serum, and the small glands of the choroid plexuses were tumid. Valsalva, Epist. ix. 2. I am indebted to Albertini for the following case. Case 2. Epilepsy from dentition, with hydrocephalus. A boy seventeen months old, the first-born of noble parents, had a larger head than is usual at that age; his eyes were dull, one part of his thorax was depressed, his legs were not adequately firm, and his muscles were flaccid. When the child was scarcely a year old, a kind of epileptic affection arose from dentition, which was removed by the abstraction of two ounces of blood. When cutting one of the upper dentes canini, he was first seized with fever, then with a violent paroxysm of epilepsy. The physician found him breathing with stertor, and his pulse imper- ceptible. By the application of external stimuli the violence of the fit somewhat decreased, and when the pulse became perceptible three ounces of blood palsy succeeded. Many times in the year it has been requisite to abstract blood to relieve the oppressed state of the head; but he has been getting worse by imperceptible degrees, so that for nearly two years he has been incapable of moving a limb, or supporting his head : in whatever position he is laid there he must remain in a state of perfect immobility; yet he can speak and swallow—and his reason, in general, is unclouded.—Ed.

547 covering of the heart exhibited slight ulceration, and from this circumstance it is probable that the pricking and slight convulsions had arisen. Morgagni, xvi. 43. The quality of the fluid in these cases is variable. When discharged, I have often perceived that it was of a yellow colour, or inclining to a green, a blue, or a white. When any particular particles are preva- lent in the serum of the blood, they will predominate in the secretions. This circumstance has been manifest in persons in whom the functions of the kidneys have long been suspended ; for the saliva has acquired the colour, taste, and odour of urine. The fluid of the pericardium in persons who had long suffered under dropsy of that capsule, was found by Vieussens to coagulate spontaneously, as well as by exposure to heat. It rendered the tincture of mallows green, and effervesced with acids. In a case of hydrothorax accompanied with hydrops pericardii, it has already been stated that a portion of the thoracic fluid coagulated on exposure to the fire, but the pericardiac fluid did not coagu- late. These varieties, no doubt, are ascribable to the difference of time which had elapsed after the effusion had taken place ; and to a diversity in the morbid diathesis of the blood and viscera. The quantity of fluid which is occasionally con- tained in the pericardium is almost incredible, and it may originate from a redundance of serum in the blood, or from the circulation in the parts about the praecordia being retarded, either in consequence of lesion in the organs themselves, or from some other cause. But fluids sometimes accumulate n n 2

335 visceral disease. The right cavity of the thorax was filled with pus, and the lung on that side was so reduced in bulk, that, at first, it appeared to be wholly wanting. Whilst moving the body, pus issued from the trachea; but no abscess was found in the lung, at least as far as the intolerable fetor allowed us to investigate. In some places, how- ever, there were small tubercles, which emitted a little pus. The pleura costalis was exempt from disease, but the pericardium was replete with serum.â€” Valsalva, xxii. 6. Cases have been observed, in which a part or the whole of a lung has been destroyed by ulceration. An instance occurred to Haller in which the left lobe of the lungs had totally disappeared, and in its stead he found an abundance of a rather offensive fluid, which was viscid, like the white of an egg. It was a remarkable circumstance, too, that the larger arteries and veins appeared as if they had been cut through, and were so evidently gaping at their extremities, that it was difficult to conjecture by what means haemorrhage had been counteracted. The progressive accumulation of pus in the thorax must tend to compress the lungs within a narrow compass; and where they have been surrounded by a large quantity of water they have undergone so much compression as to excite a suspicion of having been totally wanting.* Morgagni, 7. * Instances have occurred in which after the discharge of large quantities of pus from the thorax, either through the parietes of the chest or by the mouth, the patient has recovered; and after death, from other causes, it was found that respiration had been

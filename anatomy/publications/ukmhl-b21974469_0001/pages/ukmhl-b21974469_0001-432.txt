Hence arose the oppression and tightness at the chest, and the increased secretion from the bron- chial glands. Turgescence of vessels upon the surface of the heart would account for the dropsy of the pericardium.â€”Morgagni, 22. Case 14. Aneurism of the heart and of the aorta ; the aorta ossified. A man fifty years of age, daily occupie-d as a wool-dresser, complained of difficult respiration, accompanied with wheezing. Sometimes he was attacked with a sense of constriction at the prsecordia, and distress in breathing, and these paroxysms were occasionally succeeded by violent pain in the loins. The arteries of the neck pulsated strongly. A few days before death haemoptysis came on, with extremely disturbed respiration. Dissection. A quantity of serum, the colour of diluted blood, was effused into both cavities of the thorax. The lower part of the left lung, and one lobe of the right, were black from the extrava- sation of blood into their substance. The heart was enlarged; and the aorta, near the heart, was dilated into an aneurism, the internal parietes of which were interspersed with osseous squamae. The cerebrum was soft, and a serous fluid was effused about it; but the larger quantity was accumulated at the origin of the spinal marrow. Valsalva, xvii. 23,

54 him. He died on the fifth day of this kind of apo- plectic affection.* Dissection. The stomach was distended with gas; the kidneys were flaccid; the bladder con- tained an oval calculus as large as a pullet’s egg, having a rough surface and a reddish colour. The lungs were redder than usual; the heart was large; and the blood was fluid. The dura mater appeared corrugated, but under the pia mater, in the sulci of the brain, so limpid a fluid was deposited that the membrane resembled glass. There appeared to be a greater quantity of this fluid in the right hemisphere than in the left; and the lateral ventricles contained about two ounces of it. There was also a vesicle on the right plexus choroides as large as a filbert, and some smaller vesicles were discoverable on the left. The internal coat of the carotid and vertebral arteries exhibited some firm and opaque spots, most of which were of the nature of cartilage, but others approached that of bone. The serous fluid in the head was not coagulable by heat or by sulphuric acid, as that was which had escaped from the leg.— Valsalva, iv. 2. * There does not appear in this case to have been that degree of mental and bodily insensibility, with stertorous breathing, which usually characterizes apoplexy, and this will be observed in some of the ensuing cases; but where there is nothing decidedly at variance with the preservation of Morgagni’s opinion, I have thought it proper to retain his designations of disease. Had I considered it right to dispense with this feeling, I perhaps should have arranged some of these cases under paralysis, rather than under apoplexy.—Ed.

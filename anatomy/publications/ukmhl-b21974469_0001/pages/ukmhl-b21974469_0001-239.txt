199 part of the orbit were somewhat carious, but not to such a degree as to affect the superincumbent cerebrum. Towards the left part of the occiput, however, a small portion of the cerebral substance exhibited a brownish colour, and pus was secreted upon the external surface of the dura mater corres- ponding with this discoloured part.— Valsalva, li. 7. Case 5. Deposition of serum, and adhesion of the dura mater. A man sixty years of age, subject to epilepsy, fell to the ground during one of the paroxysms, and received a blow on the left side of the head, and on the corresponding side of the thorax. He had considerable pain in that part of the chest, his respiration became difficult, and he brought up some blood in his exertions to vomit. His mind was imbecile, and he felt a sense of weight in the head, so that when spoken to he scarcely answered. Dissection. The left cavity of the thorax was healthy, but the right contained about a pint of serum; and the lung on this side was universally indurated, and the upper lobule was adherent to the costal pleura. The left temporal muscle was a little bruised; and a portion of coagulated blood was found between the left os petrosum and the dura mater: and this membrane was so closely united to the petrous process that they could not be separated without considerable violence. By the sides of the vessels in the pia mater there was a sort of gelatinous deposition, and the ventricles contained alittk serum.— Valsalva, li. 6

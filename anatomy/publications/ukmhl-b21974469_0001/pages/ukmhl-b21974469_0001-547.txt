507 whom, for the space of four days, no pulsation could be perceived in any of the arteries, yet he was strong and active ; and even on the day of his decease he rose from bed and dressed himself. During these four days he was perfectly cold, and did not micturate. Both coldness and ischuria have frequently occurred in these patients. I do not recollect, however, that either of these circum- stances has been observed, in general, till about the termination of the asphyxia. It is remarkable that whilst there is so great a diminution in the action of the arteries, other functions do not cease, as in paroxysms of syncope. It occasionally happens that wonted health is regained after the lapse of many days, during which the body was cold and pulsation suspended. Bartholin observed this cessation of the pulse for six days, yet the patient recovered.* * In a work of this nature it would be highly improper to overlook the case of John Hunter, who laboured under symptoms of angina pectoris for twenty years. When attacked, and feeling pain in the region of the pylorus, he accidentally observed that his face was pallid, and like that of a dead man : and on applying his finger to the wrists, he discovered that there was no pulsation in either radial artery, and there was also a cessation of invo- luntary respiration. He continued in this state for three quarters of an hour, and felt as if death would certainly happen if breathing was not carried on by voluntary efforts. Exertion always brought on a paroxysm, though not all kinds of exertion in an equal degree; and he was liable to attacks from distension of the stomach. The disease had originated from an affection of the mind, and from no causes were the subsequent paroxysms so severe as from mental perturbation.

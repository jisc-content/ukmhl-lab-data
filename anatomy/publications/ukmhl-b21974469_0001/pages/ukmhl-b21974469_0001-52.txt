12 of hairs within the dura mater; others have found hairs even within the ventricles of the heart. Morgagni, xxiv. 4. Worms. Many cases are on record of worms found in the sinuses of the brain. It is probable that they were merely concretions of lymph. Nar- rations of worms crawling from the frontal sinus are authenticated by numerous testimonies, and have been ascribed to the ova of insects drawn in during respiration, or whilst smelling flowers with a strong inspiration. Boerhaave mentions a girl, cured by him, whose pituitary sinuses were full of worms. The frontal sinus has been trephined where worms have been suspected, and other means had failed to remove them.—Morgagni, i. 9. Irregularities have often been observed in the structure of the cranium which did not result from disease. The cranium has been found extremely thin, being more pitted than usual. In some of the pits the bone was merely a thin lamella, some- times even perforated.—Morgagni, lxiii. 8. The frontal and sphenoidal sinuses have been wanting. The styloid process has been found four inches in length, but this has been the result of ossification of the ligament, the ossification being then complete; in other cases it has been observed only ossified in parts.—Morgagni, lxiii. 13.

It is not a rare occurrence for these cartilages, and those of the larynx, to become bony in old people. The intestines were inflamed. The gall-bladder was situated transversely in the liver, and though of a natural size it had no corresponding depres- sion in that viscus. It contained a small quantity of dark-coloured and viscid bile, in which there were twenty black calculi, and from their colour I immediately predicted that they would not inflame, nor indeed scarcely crepitate, when applied to the flame, which was verified by experiment.

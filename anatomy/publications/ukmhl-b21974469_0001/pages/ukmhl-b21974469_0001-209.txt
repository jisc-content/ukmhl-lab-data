169 Case 7. Confusion of vision from paralysis in the muscles of the eye. A priest who for some time had been troubled with an eruption on one or the other cheek, was suddenly affected with such confusion of sight that when he directed his eyes downwards to read, as we usually do, the letters appeared to be crowded one upon another, and in a degree to decussate. But this confusion was immediately removed by shutting one eye, or by placing the book directly opposite both eyes when they were not directed downwards, and even if they were turned upwards. Some disorder however remained if the book thus placed was transferred a little to the right side, but not when it was removed to the left. I was con- sulted respecting this case by letter, and from the history given of it there appeared to be a defect in the actions of the right abductor muscle, and in the adjacent depressor, so that if the eyes were directed downwards, or turned to the right side, they were moved unequally, and the letters consequently appeared doubled and placed upon one another. I conjectured that there was slight paralysis in these two muscles. Sometimes I have known a muscle become adherent to the nearest immoveable part, so that it has been rendered incapable of its natural action. If any of the muscles are too long or too shortâ€”if they are too detached or too confined in their motions from birth, a proportionate degree of stra- bismus will be the consequence.

134 Case 5. Insanity from deposition of serum, induration of the cerebrum, and jiaccidity of the cerebellum; with dilated vessels. Towards the close of 1723 I carefully dissected the head and neck of a man who had long been the subject of mental alienation, and who died from slow fever. The carotid arteries and internal jugular veins were dilated. A serous fluid was deposited beneath the membranes. Though it was the fifth or sixth day after death, the cerebrum was indurated; the cerebellum on the contrary was flaccid.â€”Morgagni, viii. 11. Case 6. Insanity from deposition of serum, and induration of the cerebrum and cerebellum. i A woman apparently about middle age, who had been afflicted with mental derangement, died in the hospital in 1746. Dissection. The body was greatly emaciated, and one lobe of the lungs was nearly full of pus. On examining the brain it was observed that the pia mater could be drawn from its convolu- tions with unusual facility; from which circum- stance no doubt was entertained, that serum had existed beneath that membrane. A moderate quantity of fluid was observed in the ventricles, and a larger quantity flowed from the spinal canal. The substance of the cerebrum and cerebellum was harder than usual. The choroid plexuses were discoloured, and in some parts intimately united

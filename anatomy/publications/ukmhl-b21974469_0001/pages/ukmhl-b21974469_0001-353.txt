The patient became unable to speak, and died on the eighth day. Dissection.

They were smooth internally, and empty, and I supposed them to be the vestige of an old disease. The odour of this part of the lungs resembled that of acid whey, or the halitus of children having worms. The upper lobe of the left lung abounded with a serous humidity, and the inferior lobe was heavy, red, and of a liver- like texture. It had contracted adhesions with the pleura, and, in some places, was covered with broad portions of coagulable lymph; and a similar concretion, having a red colour, was spread upon the corresponding surface of the diaphragm.

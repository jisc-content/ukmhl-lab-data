92 was slightly delirious in the night; and slept during the greater part of the day ; but at times his intellectual faculties were vigorous. He died within the tenth night. Dissection. Whilst dividing the head from the trunk, and sawing off the calvarium, a serous fluid escaped. The vessels distributed through the membranes of the brain, and upon the surface of the lateral ventricles as well as through the medullary substance of the cerebrum, were unnaturally turgid with blood. Both hemispheres of the cerebrum were indurated; the corpus callosum was soft; the fornix and its pillars were still softerâ€”indeed almost liquescent. The left corpus striatum was softer than the right, but the septum lucidum w as firm in its texture. The ventricles contained a great quantity of limpid water; and even the pineal gland was distended with a similar fluid. The cerebellum presented a natural appearance exter- nally; but when the scalpel had descended into it, the structure was found to offer unusual resistance. Instead of the usual appearance of the arbor vitae, there were parallel medullary striae amongst the cineritious substance. When the central portion of the cerebellum was divided, I found it was neither soft, nor of two colours, nor intersected with sulci; but was converted into a scirrhous texture, nearly of a pale flesh colour, consisting of what appeared like roundish bodies impacted together, exhibiting neither membrane, vessels, nor inter- stice. The disease extended a little towards the right side, but it occupied nearly the whole of the left lobe. In the right lobe the cortical and

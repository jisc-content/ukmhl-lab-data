163 Case 1. Disease in the coats of the eye and in the optic nerve. A man from Tuscany was almost destroyed by a very large and fetid ulcer of the leg, and on this account he obtained admission into the hospital, where he died about the middle of January 1740. Dissection. While dissecting the head for other purposes I perceived that the man had been blind in the right eye, but I could not ascertain the date of his blindness. The left eye was in a natural state; and no vestige of any previous wound could be discovered. The muscles of the diseased eye were pale, and the ball of the eye was greatly diminished in bulk. The anterior surface was white, and exhibited no trace of the cornea; but it was divided into three small protuberances. These prominences, as well as the greater part of the remaining sub- stance of the eye, consisted of the tunica sclerotica, which was indurated and thickened in conse- quence of its contraction. This coat included the choroides, which was equally contracted, and was moist; but all the other coats and humours either were absorbed or had escaped. The optic nerves being exposed both in the orbits and within the skull, appeared widely different from each other. Whilst the left was in a natural state, the right was of a cineritious colour, and greatly exte- nuated. From the eye to a little beyond the breadth of a finger, it contained nothing of nervous sub- stance, but a grey, turbid, and glutinous humour; and when this humour was squeezed out, the coats of the nerve were found to be much thickened. m 2

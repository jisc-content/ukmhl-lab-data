274 proved destructive to life about the sixteenth day, as it had happened in the preceding instance. Dissection. There was an accumulation of limpid fluid in the left cavity of the thorax. The right lung, however, was indurated, and annexed to the neighbouring parts, but more particularly in the region of the scapula. In this part there was fluid like whey, and such concretions floated in the fluid as bore a resemblance to the white of an egg coagu- lated in hot water. The pericardium was greatly distended with a similar fluid, and was pervaded by the same kind of concretions, some of which also adhered to the inner surface of this bag, and also to the superfice of the heart.â€” Valsalva, xx. 36. Case 8. In March 1706 a woman died of peripneumony in the hospital of St. Mary de Morte. It had been noticed, during the progress of the disease, that there was some inequality of the pulse. This event occurred at a time when Valsalva was gone to Padua, and in his absence I dissected the bodies in the anatomical theatre for him. Dissection. The lungs were of a compact texture, like that of liver; and the pericardium contained an excessive quantity of serous fluid. The surface of the heart presented an appearance that, at first sight, might be taken for ulceration, but which, in reality, arose from irregular concretions of coagu- lable lymph. When they were removed, which was readily effected, the external membrane of the heart appeared to be perfectly smooth and unin- jured. Concretions likewise adhered to the inner

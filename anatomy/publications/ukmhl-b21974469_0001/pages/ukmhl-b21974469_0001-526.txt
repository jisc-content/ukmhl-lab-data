486 influence is often exerted upon the heart and aorta. Patients having aneurism or other diseases of the aorta, have died suddenly in a paroxysm of anger, and the pericardium was filled with blood; or blood has, at least, been extravasated.—xxvi. 26. An old man, attempting to escape apprehension after having been guilty of stealing, was struck with a club and fell lifeless. The aorta was found to be lacerated transversely; and it is probable that the various passions awakened in the attempted flight had contributed to the rupture of the vessel. Morgagni, liii. 35. Tabarrano mentions the case of Cardinal Bon- compagno at Rome, whose sudden death arose from ulceration and ultimate rupture of the pul- monary artery, in consequence of which blood had escaped into the pericardium. He had complained of most of the symptoms which usually attend cases of thoracic aneurism. In a soldier who died suddenly after protracted grief, a large quantity of coagulated blood was found in the pericardium. Ramazzini relates the case of a man who died suddenly, in whose pericardium two pounds of coagulated blood were found. Two cases are upon record in which sudden death happened from rupture of one of the coro- nary arteries, and the consequent extravasation of blood into the same bag. If blood is found in the pericardium when decease had not been sudden, it must have been extravasated gradually either from small vessels or through minute orifices.—Morgagni, xxvi. 26.

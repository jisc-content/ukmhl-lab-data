For a few seconds he was stunned, but recovering himself, he com- plained of pain in the injured part. He did not confine himself to bed till the fourth day, on which he came into the hospital of St. Mary de Vita. The wound was so exceedingly tender that he could not even bear the contact of lint or tow in wiping it. About the seventh day he was seized with paralysis of the left arm, but this affection was partially removed by the abstraction of blood. He survived until the twenty-third day, and then died under the symptoms of lethargy. Dissection. At the time of sawing through the skull at the right temple, pus issued from the cavity; but no injury was observable in the cranium except the disjunction of the lambdoidal suture. An abscess had formed in the correspondent por- tion of the cerebrum, and descended to the depth of two digits: and a small quantity of pus had been deposited between the dura and pia mater where they cover the anterior lobe of the right hemisphere. Some limpid serum was discovered in the ventricles, and at the commencement of the spinal canal. Valsalva, li. 28.

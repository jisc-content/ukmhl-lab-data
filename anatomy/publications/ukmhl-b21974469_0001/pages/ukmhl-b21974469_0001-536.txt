Leprotti has related a case of unexpected death in which it was discovered that blood from a rup- ture in the bronchial artery was effused into the posterior mediastinum, and had insinuated itself to a considerable extent, through the interstices of the fibres by which the trachea, the aorta, the oesophagus, and adjacent parts, are united toge- ther ; and being coagulated, it had raised up the membranes into the form of tumour. In Trombelli, an excellent surgeon and physician at Bologna, blood was extravasated from some artery between the laminae of the anterior medias- tinum, and by its being diffused through the cellular substance of this part, and having coagulated, the mediastinum, contiguous to the diaphragm, was nearly three inches in solid thickness.

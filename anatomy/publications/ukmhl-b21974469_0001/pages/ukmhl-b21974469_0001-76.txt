38 presented the appearance of jelly. Not only were the vessels in the substance of the brain consider- ably distended, but those also which are distributed upon the membrane of the ventricles. The ven- tricles did not contain much fluid, but there were small vesicles upon the posterior surface of the choroid plexuses.â€”Morgagni, iii. 14. Case 12. Apoplexy from extravasation into the right hemisphere of the cerebrum, extending to the left hemisphere. A man, forty years of age, liable to vertigo from intemperate abuse of wine, was seized with apo- plexy the beginning of February 1703. The left side was completely paralyzed, and the right was soon afterwards affected with slight convulsive motions ; he became more heavily apoplectic, and died after the lapse of a short time. Dissection. Even the smallest vessels of the pericranium were so turgid as to be distinctly visible; but there was yet greater turgescence in those of the membranes of the brain, especially in the pia mater of the left hemisphere, on which also, there was a black stripe of extravasated blood. The right ventricle contained a considera- ble quantity of coagulated blood, which had flowed into it from a large cavity in the medullary sub- stance, through the external side of the corpus striatum and of the thalamus nervi optici. A small quantity of blood had flowed from the right into the left ventricle. Previous to the dissection of this woman, Valsalva said to me, that if his obser- vations did not deceive him, the principal lesion

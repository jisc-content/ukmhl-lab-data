439 and expectoration, though she had no cough. I only examined the abdominal viscera. Dissection, The aorta from the diaphragm to the iliacs, was universally unequal from bony lamellae; and a thick matter, of a brown and bloody appearance, adhered in some places to the internal coat, having been secreted by ulcers in that mem- brane ; and this diseased state was continued into the coats of the splenic artery.—Morgagni, xl. 24. It has happened, though indeed very rarely, that the coats of arteries have been affected with gan- grene, whilst the surrounding parts were in a healthy state.—Morgagni, lv. 23. Ossification of the aorta. Case 1. A woman about sixty years of age had constant difficulty of breathing, and occasional palpitation of the heart. She was unable to respire except with the neck erect; and experienced so urgent a sensa- tion of constriction and anxiety in the region of the heart, that she often appeared to be on the point of death. The pulse never was intermittent, but the veins were large. She died early in March 1731. Dissection. The thorax and abdomen contained some fluid, but there was none in the pericardium. The valves of the aorta were indurated, and one of them was ossified. Some places throughout the trunk of the aorta, on its inner surface, exhibited either bone or something verging to bone. In several parts it was unequal, and in others of a whitish colour, as it generally is when the process of ossification commences.—Morgagni, xxiii. 8.

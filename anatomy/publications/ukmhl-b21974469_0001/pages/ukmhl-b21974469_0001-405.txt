365 forms on the surface of coagulated blood. These concretions, however, are sometimes begun and even completed in the living body. I believe that they may commence in cases of protracted syncope; and in those aneurisms which resemble an appended sac, they are perfected.—Morgagni, xxiv. 30. Though in the following case it is not satisfac- torily proved that the blood had coagulated during life, it may be worthy of record.—Ed. John Anthony Stancari, whilst examining the body of a woman, found the vena cava and emul- gent veins dilated; the coats were partly cartilagi- nous and in other places bony; and they, as well as the iliac and other veins, were nearly filled with a hard and polypous substance. It was ascertained that previous to death her body had been universally tumid, and of that livid hue which the skin usually exhibits when a great number of the subjacent veins are turgid with blood. It was also reported that her respiration had been extremely difficult, and the pulse ex- cessively feeble. *— Morgagni, lxiv. 9. * Concretions in the heart often present so strikingly the appearances of organized substances, that considerable circum- spection is requisite before they should be reported as such. If, however, the surface from which they are removed is smooth, it may pretty safely be inferred that they formed after death; or, at least, that they are not organized structures. Mr. James Stewart has published a case of enlargement of the heart, with polypi. The pericardium was prominent, and con- tained fifteen ounces of serum, and two ounces of coagulated blood. The blood had been extravasated by some small vessels on the surface of the heart, all of which were enlarged and turgid. The heart weighed 2Jib. Around the root of the aorta, blood had

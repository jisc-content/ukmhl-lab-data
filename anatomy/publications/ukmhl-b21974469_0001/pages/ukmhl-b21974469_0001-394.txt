Valsalva, xxiv. 2.

Many cases, however, have occurred, in which no asphyxia arose from adhesion; and I apprehend that it was chiefly occasioned by the state of the membrane of the heart, and the fluid in the peri- c ardium. *—Morgagni, 3. * Adhesion of the pericardium to the heart is a frequent result of rheumatic inflammation; and the lymph which is effused and concreted on the surface, not only forms a thick white membrane, but often presents a granular appearance. The heart will mostly be found enlarged in these cases. I shall only relate the following instance. James Off, about fifty-six years of age, had for seven years been a subject of rheumatism, with which he was chiefly affected in his hands, arms, and knees. About three years before death he experienced difficulty of respiration, with cough, and evening perspirations.

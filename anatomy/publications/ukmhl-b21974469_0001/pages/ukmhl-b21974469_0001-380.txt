340 Dissection. The abdomen contained a small quantity of limpid serum, and the omentum adhered by small filaments to the mesentery and perito- neum. These three parts, as well as the surface of the intestines, uterus, and gall-bladder, were rough from protuberating bodies, having a diversity of form and magnitude. Those in the upper part of the omentum were very small, and more distant from each other; and those in the lower part were large and aggregated. In the left lung there was not only an abscess, but also bodies similar to those which were found within the abdomen. Some of these tubercles contained pus ; some contained matter nearly of a pultaceous consistence; and the solidity of others gave them a resemblance to the texture of conglo- bate glands.—Valsalva, xxii. 18. Morton has justly observed, “ mirum non esse, si “ scrophulosi, qui iumoribus glandulosis in aliis “ partibus frequenter obnoxii sunt, non raro etiam “ ejusmodi tuberculis vel in ipsis pulmonibus affici- “ anturand of strumous phthisis he says, ic certissirnum diagnosticum sumendum esse a tumo- “ ribus glandulosis in externo habitu corporis earn “ comitantibus.” This opinion my own observation has confirmed, and other cases are extant in the Sepulchretum. One of them demonstrates a three- fold variety of matter, contained in these tubercles; some were filled with pus, others with a substance like honey ; but the greater part, and these of the smaller size, were filled with a kind of steatomatous matter. This was probably of the same nature as the contents of tubercles, in the case of a boy

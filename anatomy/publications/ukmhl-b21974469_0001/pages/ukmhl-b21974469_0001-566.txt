526 Case 7. Hydrothorax, with a tuberculated and thickened pleura, and tuberculated peritoneum and omentum: the pulsations of the heart and arteries unequal. A little before the close of the year 1704, a lad experienced some difficulty of breathing, which arose without any evident cause. He wras received into the hospital of St. Mary de Morte, and different methods of treatment were employed, but without success. He was repeatedly bled, and the dyspnoea was alleviated for a time by this means; but though purgative medicines did not appear to be injurious, he was not benefited by them in the slightest degree. These circumstances were related to me when I first saw the patient, which was scarcely three days before his death. He was then pallid, and the state of his respiration constantly required the erect position. During the act of inspiration I observed that the lower part of the chest was greatly elevated. He had yet to the last she was able to lie horizontally. She had ascites and a diseased liver; and the legs became anasarcous. Dissection. The chest was full of fluid, which at the top wras of a yellow colour, but the lower portions were exceedingly bloody. From the left cavity I removed nearly six pints of fluid, and from the right upwards of four. The left lung was com- pressed into a space not exceeding the extent of a hand when laid flat; the right lung was compressed into a small bulk, though not so small as the left. The texture of these viscera did not appear to have sustained any lesion except condensation from pressure. The costal pleura was extensively livid, and I presume that the blood had been extravasated from the turgid vessels of this membrane.â€”Ed.

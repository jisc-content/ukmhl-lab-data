436 heart; and, near the orifice, the aorta appeared as if it were ecchymosed. The whole internal surface of the artery was in that unequal and pustular state which has been described, and the disease was continued through the subclavian, carotid, and coronary arteries, the latter of which were so dilated as to equal the size of the left carotid. The spleen was small and flaccid; the kidneys also were flabby ; and the place of each pelvis was occupied by a kind of spongy substance. As it was known that a bullet had lodged in this noble- man’s left thigh for thirty years, I cut into the part, and found it tightly enveloped in membraneous structure.—Morgagni, xxvii. 28. In the case of Trombelli, an eminent physician and surgeon at Bologna, who died from the rupture of a blood-vessel in the anterior mediastinum; a tubercle the size of a large nut had formed between the coats of the aorta, near the heart, full of a humour verging to the colour of the vitellus ovi. He had undergone deep mental afflictions, and afterwards experienced slight palpitations of the heart, and was occasionally affected with transient deliquia animi.*—xxvi. 39. * “ One of the most frequent appearances of disease in the “ coats of arteries” says Mr. Hodgson “ is produced by a depo- “ sition of atheromatous or purulent matter in the cellular mem* “ brane that connects the internal and middle coats of the vessel. “ The diseased part is of an opaque yellow colour, and generally “ somewhat elevated from the surrounding surface. Sometimes “ these elevations are considerable and very extensive; whilst at “ others they are circumscribed and have a pustular or tubercular “ appearance.” They contain matter varying in consistence

488 from the right side of the vertebrae to the left side of the distended abdomen. The spleen, the sto- mach, the intestines, the mesentery, the vena cava, and the left kidney, were so far displaced towards the right side, that even the left kidney was situated in the umbilical region. The aneurism was of an oval figure, but when full of blood it had been spherical. It contained a large quantity of lamel- lated concretions in the circumference, and of grumous blood in its centre. When this blood had been removed, we observed that the aorta began to dilate in a direction towards the right side, as soon as it entered the abdomen; not more so, however, than to admit a clenched fist. It then expanded to the left side, which appeared to con- stitute the anterior and lateral parietes of the aneurism; and the sac communicated largely with the aorta betwixt the appendices of the diaphragm. When the lateral parietes reached the posterior parts, they terminated; and their border was closely adherent to those parts which the aneurism had not displaced, so that they constituted part of the parietes of the aneurism. Those of them, however, which, in consequence of their bony nature, yielded less to the impulse of the blood, were carious; and the periostium was ulcerated. The lower rib, the concave surface of the ilium, and the vertebrae, were most diseased: for the transverse processes, and the bodies of the latter, were nearly destroyed, whilst the thick inter- vertebral cartilages were all in their natural situation, prominent, untouched by disease, and beautifully white. We were surprised to find all

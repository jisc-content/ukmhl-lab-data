420 was ossified in places, and not wholly free from appearances of ulceration. Some of the abdominal branches of the aorta, especially those of the cceliac artery, were involved in the ossific process. The spleen was turgid with frothy blood. The gall-bladder was greatly contracted, and filled by fourteen calculi of different sizes, of a cubical figure, and inflammable. The right kidney had a superficial ulcer on one part; and on other parts it exhibited small cicatrices. The texture of these viscera was flaccid. The dura mater was found so closely united with the sutures and their adjacent parts, especially with the sagittal and lambdoidal, that it could not be disunited from them without laceration. There was fluid beneath the pia mater, and in the lateral ventricles. The cerebellum was soft. The coats of the basilary artery, and of other arteries about the cerebrum, were indurated. On the basis and concave surface of the os frontis there were numerous osseous prominences; and similar appearances presented themselves in the basis cranii, and especially on the petrous portion of the temporal bone: but they were smaller on these parts—more distant—and less elevated. All these tuberosities were constituted of a whiter substance than that of the bones of the cranium, and seemed to consist of a new deposition of bony matter. Although their surfaces were smooth they must necessarily have compressed the cerebrum.—Morgagni, xxvii. 2. I did not consider the bony tuberosities so much of the nature of exostoses, as of an accretion of new

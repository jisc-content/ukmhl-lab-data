He expectorated so large a quantity of puriform matter, that, had it not been distinguished from pus, a supposition might have been entertained, that the fistula really did enter the thorax. When the patient died, which occurred in January 1757, Mediavia dis- sected the body. Dissection. The lungs were healthy. Both the ventricles of the heart were dilated, but the thick- ness of the parietes was not diminished. The trunk of the pulmonary artery exceeded its natural diameter; and that of the aorta was greatly dilated, quite to the beginning of its curvature. The inner surface of this vessel was white, hard, and unequal. Morgagni, lxiv. 12. Case 25. Incipient aneurism of the heart and aorta; with diseased liver.

423 ventricle was dilated to three times its usual extent.—Morgagni, lxiv. 15. I formerly said, that instances of rupture of the right ventricle of the heart were much more rare than of the left; I still believe them to be more uncommon, but not so much so as I considered them at that time. Morand has mentioned an instance of this na- ture; and Christian Vater has also related a case of rupture of the right ventricle, to the extent of more than a finger nail, from a violent blow given by a carriage which was passing the man. There was no appearance of any previous morbid dispo- sition. Two cases are related by Haller, and others are on record. —Morgagni, xxvii. 10, lxiv. 16. Lancisi ascribed rupture of the heart to a feeble state of its fibres, and likewise to ulceration. Morand has written and collected more than any other person on the subject of rupture of the heart, and has given a striking instance from each of these causes. They both happened in 1750; one in a princess, considerably advanced in life, the right ventricle of whose heart had become ulcerated externally, and the ulcer, by degrees, had pene- trated the cavity, and blood was consequently effused into the pericardium. The other was the case of a nobleman, whose pericardium was filled with coagulated blood, and the heart was so extremely flaccid that it could be pierced through by the weight of a probe. The blood had been effused from the left ventricle through a fissure about eight lines in length, in the middle of that ventricle.—xxvii. 7.

299 The stomach and intestines, but particularly the colon, were inflated with gas. The lower part of the spleen was peculiarly black, and this appear- ance entered deeply into its substance, so as to indicate the commencement of gangrene. The liver was greatly enlarged, and had a pale com- plexion. The gall-bladder contained upwards of seventy calculi and a little bile of a light yellow colour. The larger calculi did not exceed a bean in magnitude, and there were only a few of this size: the smallest, however, was not less than a peppercorn. The former were nearly oval;—the latter approximated to the cubical form. They were constituted of an inner portion, which was moist with bile, and granular; and this was enclosed in, at least, a double incrustation, which in most of them was of a greenish hue, but in some it was partially white. All these concretions were in- flammable. The right kidney was exceedingly flabby.—Morgagni, xxi. 36. I never witnessed a greater degree of pleuritic lesion consequent upon thoracic inflammation than was exhibited in this instance. Though ancient authors have entertained differences of opinion with respect to the complication of pulmonary with pleuritic inflammation, it cannot be denied that sometimes essential morbid changes take place in the costal pleura without injury of the lungs ; but undoubtedly such instances are ex- ceedingly rare, in comparison with the multitude of cases in which membraneous inflammation is combined with the parenchymatous. Indeed, in dissection, inflammation of the pleura is not so

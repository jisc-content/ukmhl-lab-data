% 33 Case 8. Apoplexy from extravasation beneath the dura mater, with ossification of the falx. A man advanced in years died apoplectic after an illness of some days. The only information I could obtain respecting him was, that he had a strong pulse,, but no difficulty of respiration. Dissection. There was nothing unnatural in the abdomen. The lungs adhered universally to the costal pleura; the heart was extremely fat; the valve of the coronary vein was fixed and perforated with small foramina; and the left vertebral artery arose from the aorta itself, and not, as usual, from the arteria innominata. In the head about half a pound of blood was effused between the dura mater and tunica arach- noides. Ossification had taken place between the duplicatures of the falx; the ossified part being three digits in length, and half that extent in depth, and moderately but unequally thick. The posterior right branch of the carotid artery was larger than usual.â€”Morgagni, iv. 20. Case 9. Apoplexy from extravasation beneath the pid mater, with pulmonary congestion. A man, fifty-eight years of age, of sound con- stitution, but greatly addicted to the use of tobacco, fell whilst he was buckling his shoes. He neither spoke, nor moved any part of the body. His face became alternately pale and yellow; saliva flowed from his mouth, and he died within a quar- ter of an hour. D

Besides complaining of thirst and dry cough, he was unable to lie on the left side; and as often as he attempted it, by turning a little to that side, a sensation of swooning came on, and increased as he continued to turn. He averted its completion, however, by regaining the supine position, or by lying on the contrary side. No pulsation could be perceived. Dissection.

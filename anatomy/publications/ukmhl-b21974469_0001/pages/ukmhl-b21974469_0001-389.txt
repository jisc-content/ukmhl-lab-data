349 conformation of his thorax was good—it did not recede from the broad bones of the scapulae, and thus render them prominent like wings. His cough, expectoration, and emaciated state of body, however, continued, and gave me pain. The sputa were of a yellowish and cineritious colour, espe- cially in the morning, and of a saltish flavour. Though the cough was diminished, it was still troublesome morning and evening, and seemed to arise from irritation in the upper part of the thorax. The cold season was approaching, which he was obliged to pass in his bleak native place, where the cold is severe and protracted. On this account I again urged the necessity of strict attention to defend himself from atmospheric inclemencies, and to persevere in the use of remedies, the chief of which was milk, at first from the ass, and after- wards from the cow. He returned home, and having taken ass’s milk during a month, the sputum presented a more hopeful appearance. He then adopted the cow’s milk, and by the end of Decem- ber all irritation had ceased and he appeared well. So much did one kind of remedy effect, in an unfavourable place and season, when aided by the assiduity and caution of the patient, and when all the efforts were crowned with the Divine benediction.—Morgagni, xxii. 31.

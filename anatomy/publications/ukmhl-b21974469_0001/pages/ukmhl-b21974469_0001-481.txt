441 The following case will tend to confirm the opinion, that ossification of the aorta is not uni- formly accompanied with those symptoms. Case 2. A decrepit old woman having undergone an acute disease, was left with gangrenous sores ; and was, at length, reduced to a most emaciated state, and ultimately to death. From the subsidence of the acute affection, her pulse was small and weak ; and afterwards it became quick, but never inter- mittent or unequal. She had no palpitation of the heart, nor difficulty of respiration. She complained only of uneasiness in the praecordia. Her appetite was unimpaired. Dissection. The abdominal viscera were in a healthy state. The inner surface of the fundus uteri was almost universally of that dark brownish colour which is common to gangrenous parts, and the surface was elevated by a small excres- cence. The tubes were impervious to about the middle. Within the thorax the aorta exhibited some white spots, and small scales : and the aortic valves were contracted, hard, and ossified; and were thickened at their edge by pretty large tubercles.—Morgagni, xxiii. 11. It appears, therefore, from the observations of others, as well as from cases which have occurred to me, that palpitation of the heart, and intermis- sion and inequality of the pulse, though generally arising from rigidity of the aortic valves, are not an invariable consequence of that lesion.—12*

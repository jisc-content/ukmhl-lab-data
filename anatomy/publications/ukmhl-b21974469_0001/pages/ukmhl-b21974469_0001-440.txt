400 impelled forcibly by the strong parietes of the heart into the diseased aorta, it was not urged forwards by a corresponding action in that vessel: conse- quently the blood was delayed in the left ventricle, and, of course, dilated it. The right ventricle must also have been distended in a similar manner, though in a less degree; for by the impediment to the transmission of blood through the aorta, the celerity of its motion through the lungs would be retarded. From these circumstances, therefore, and from the augmented weight upon the dia- phragm, the difficulty of respiration, and the bloody expectoration may be explained.â€”31. Case 18. Active aneurism of the hearty with dilatation of the aorta. A washer-woman apparently about forty years of age, and rather corpulent, was repeatedly brought into the hospital within the last six years of her life on account of a difficulty of breathing which presented the appearance of convulsive asthma; and during the continuance of the paroxysms no pulsation could be perceived at the wrists. She returned to the hospital under similar circum- stances about the middle of January 1740, and died within fifteen days afterwards. Towards the close of life, she expectorated a thick and purulent sputum. The body was brought into the theatre for the public demonstrations. Dissection. On viewing the surface of the body it was observed that there was no intumescence of

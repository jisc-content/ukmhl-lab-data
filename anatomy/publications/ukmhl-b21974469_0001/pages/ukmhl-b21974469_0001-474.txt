434 Aorta pustular. Jano Planco assured me that he had sometimes dissected persons who were taken off by sudden death in whom lie neither found the aorta ruptured nor dilated, but affected with pustules and promi- nencies containing a softish pultaceous matter. In an instance when attempting to remove a part of the aorta, it was observed that its external coat could easily be drawn away from the trunk and branches, just as if it had long been macerated in water; and when any one of the larger of these prominencies was cut into, it exhibited a cavity which contained that kind of matter just spoken of. Many of the smaller ones, when exsiccated, appeared as if they were bony; but as the evapo- ration of the more humid parts of this pultaceous matter produced the change, it is probable that on more accurate examination they would have been found more of the nature of tophus, or of indurated gypsum, than of true bone. The disease was propagated into some of the branches of the aorta, and is no doubt that state which sometimes pre- cedes the formation of concretions.—xxvii. 29. The following is the case alluded to, which Planco favoured me with, towards the end of 1728, a few days after he had examined the body. spots of coagulable lymphj were loosely adherent to the inner membrane. The youth was of a strumous habit of body. In an old man whose toes had sphacelated, I found some of the arteries ossified, and others nearly filled with coagulable lymph.—Ed.

490 caruncle did not possess its natural figure. It was not easy to demonstrate the two very small orifices which open on the sides of this prominence, or to discover the intervening sinus. To these circum- stances were added distinct and prominent fibres, which formed a kind of small triangle, the basis of which was near the bladder, while the apex touched the caruncle. When the abdominal viscera were removed, a large aneurism of the aorta presented itself, which, in figure, resembled a crescent, the dorsum of which was placed transversely under the annexed diaphragm, while the cornua were directed down- wards, and concealed behind the psoas muscles on each side. This aneurism, likewise, had no poste- rior parietes. The blood had formed lamellated concretions, and when these were removed, the bodies of two or three vertebrae that belonged to the lower part of the thorax and upper part of the loins immediately appeared. They w'ere denuded and deeply destroyed, but the white intervertebral cartilages were prominent, and apparently untouched by disease. The aneurism had ruptured at its upper part, where the dia- phragm had also given way, and the left cavity of the thorax was filled with blood. Morgagni, xl. 29. Although this large aneurism was so extremely obscure when I saw it, it can scarcely be doubted that some indications of it, especially pain in the loins, must have preceded. In some cases of aortic aneurism, the inter- vertebral cartilages have been found ulcerated or

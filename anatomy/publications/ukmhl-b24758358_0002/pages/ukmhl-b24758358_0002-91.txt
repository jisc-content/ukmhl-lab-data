OF LIMAX AGRESTI8, ETC. 577 even on the dark nights of winter. It is possible to speculate as to the virtues of salt as an anthelminthic, and to suggest that it may- act either by enabling a better gastric juice to be secreted, and so giving the sheep a better chance of digesting the larval fasciolae when swallowed, or by provoking a more copious flow of bile, and so washing the young fluke out of the gall-ducts. This, perhaps, is not the place for such enquiries. But it is a pure natural histoiy fact that localities rich in deposits of salt are favourable to the growth and health of sheep ^. Pallas, in the wonderful eleventh Fasciculus of his ' Spicilegia Zoologica,' dwells on this in reference to the Steatopygous variety of the domestic sheep at pp. 6^-6y; and with reference to the Argali, the Ocisfera Siberica, supposed to be the parent stock of Ovis aries, var. domestica, he writes thus at p. 12 : ' Omni vero tempore ubi possunt loca salsagine rorida quibus universa Siberia abundat crebro frequentant, terramque sale foetam cavant quod cervino quoque generi solemne est.' ' [The importance of the recommendation of salt as an anthelminthic has now been practically tested. Mr. A. P. Thomas has proved that common salt in very small proportions is fatal to the redia and sporo-cyst of Fasciola, as also to Limnaeus trun- catulus, which serves as host to the intermediate forms of the liver-fluke. Mr. T. P. Heath has published an experiment in the 'Western Morning News,' Oct. 14, 1882 (cited in Mr. Thomas's paper in ' Journ. Koyal Agric. Soc. of England,' vol. xix. S. S. part i), in which sheep fed on permanent pastiires with salt mixed with oats were quite sound, whilst others to which salt was not administered were affected with liver- flukes.â€”Editor.]

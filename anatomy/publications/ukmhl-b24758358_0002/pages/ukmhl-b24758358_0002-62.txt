ON THE DOMESTIC PIG OF 553 pp. 33 and i88, and, per contra, Nathusius, 1. c. pp. 49 and 103). In the straightness of its vertical contour it contrasts with S. celehenm; 8. andamanenms, 8. vittaius, as figured by Miiller and Schlegel, /. c. plate 32. fig. 6, and with *S'. barhalus; and resembles 8. crislatus, as it does also in its general facies. Dr. A. B. Meyer thinks that this 8us may possibly deserve to be considered a new species, 8. terna- tensis; but having had abundant experience of the facility with which the wild pigs of that region cross considerable arms of the sea, he would, I gather, express himself with much caution as to its, relations to 8.papuensis and the Suidae of the neighbouring islands, volcanic and other, tenanted by swine. The colouring, however, of the head of this 8us differs from that of any other Sus seen by Dr. A. B. Meyer, or figured by Schlegel—the head being covered all over with long black hair, except in the region occupied by a broad yellowish brown streak beginning between the eyes and descending to the snout, where it broadens.

768 THE HARVEIAN OBATION. Platone Animam mundi; aut cum aliis Naturam naturantem ; vel cum Ethnicis Saturnum aut Jovemi; vel potius, ut nos decet, Creatorem ac patrem omnium quae in coelis et terris; a quo animalia eorumque engines dependent, cujusque nutu sive effato fiunt et generantur omnia.' (' De Generatione Animalium/ Ex. 54, pp. 419, 420, ed. 1766; p. 402, ed. "Willis.) I have detained you far too long; but, feeling that my praise of Harvey has been all too feeble, I am anxious, in ending, to employ in honour of Harvey certain lines of singular beauty and force which, though composed in commemoration not of him, but of another famous Englishman, may nevertheless be applied to him with a singular appropriateness:â€” ' Remember all He spoke among you, and the man who spoke; Who never sold the truth to serve the hour, Nor paltered with Eternal God for power; Who let the turbid streams of rumour flow Thro' either babbling world of high and low; Whose life was work, whose language rife With rugged maxims hewn from life; Who never spoke against a foe. Whatever record leap to light, He never shall be shamed.'

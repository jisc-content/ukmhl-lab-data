893 ADDRESS ON ANTIIROPOLOaT. different contours which we are familiar with from Saxon graves throughout England, and from the so-called 'Danes' graves' of Yorkshire. Whatever might be the result of such a discovery and such a comparison, I think it would in neither event justify the application of the term 'Kymric' to the particular form of skull to which Ketzius and Broca have assigned it. Some years ago I noticed the absence of the brachycephalic British type of skull from an extensive series of Romano-British skulls which had come into my hands ; and subsequently to my doiug this, Canon Greenwell pointed out to me that such skulls as we had from late Keltic cemeteries, belonging to the com- paratively short period which elapsed between the end of the Bronze Period and the establishment of Roman rule in Great Britain, seemed to have reverted mostly to the prae-Bronze dolicho- cephalic type. This latter type, the ' kumbecephahc type' of Professor Daniel Wilson, manifests a singular vitality, as the late and much lamented Professor Phillips pointed out long ago at a Meeting of this Association held at Swansea—the dark-haired variety, which is very ordinarily the longer-headed and the shorter- statured variety of our countrymen, being represented in very great abundance in those regions of England which can be shown, by irrefragable and multifold evidence, to have been most thoroughly permeated, imbibed, and metamorphosed by the infusion of Saxons and Danes, in the districts, to wit, of Derby, Leicester, Stamford, and Loughborough. How, and in what way, this type of man— one to which some of the most valuable men now bearing the name of Englishmen, which they once abhorred, belong—has contrived to reassert itself, we may, if I am rightly informed, hear some dis- cussion in this department. Before leaving this part of my subject I would say that the Danish type of head still survives amongst us ; but it is to my thinking not by any means so common, at least in the Midland counties, as the dark-haired type of which we have just been speaking. And I would add that I hope I may find that the views which I have here hinted at will be found to be in accord with the extensive researches of Dr. Beddoe, a gei tle- rman who worthily represents and upholds the interests of Anthro- pology in this city, the city of Prichard, and who is considered to be more or less disqualified for occupying the post which I now hold, mainly from the fact that he has occupied it before, and that the

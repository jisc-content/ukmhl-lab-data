* ' Recherches sur la Faune Litfcorale de Bslgique—Cdtacfes,' p. 4. XXVIII. ON THE DOMESTIC CATS, FELIS DOMESTICUS AND MUSTELA FOINA, OF ANCIENT AND MQDEEN TIMES. Having recently had occasion to study the habits and anatomy of the Eng-lish Marten Cats, Mustela martes and Mustela foina, and having looked into the history of these animals and of certain other carnivora which have borne the same name as they in ancient and modern times, I have come to think that the latter of the two creatures specified, namely, the white-breasted marten, Mustela foina, was the animal which the ancient Greeks and Romans em- ployed for the same domestic purposes for which we employ the Felis domesticus; whilst this latter animal has been employed as at present in Western Europe for probably a considerably longer period than the last thousand years. Other writers to whom I have referred, and amongst them notably Dureau de la Malle, have adopted the former of these conclusions; but upon premises more or less inadequate or incorrect, or both. I am well assured that this question has for the philosophic naturalist much more than a merely archaeological interest, for in the resolving of it we may have light east upon the working of the principle which Mr. Dar- win has shown to be more potent than any other in regulating the distribution of species, and which Van Beneden, with the well-known physiological ^ aphorisms of Wolff and Treviranus before his eyes, has formulated in the words ^, ' les etres qui composent une Fauna sont solidaires entre eux comme les organes d'un etre vivant.' It is true that no such close interdependence as exists between man * Paget's 'Surgical Patliology,' p. 17, ed.

EXCAVATIONS IN AN ANCIENT 643 of pottery. Diseased hip. This cranium has some approximation to the modern form of English crania, and resembles herein cranium No.v of Sept. 1867, crania xi and iv of March 17, and cranium No. i of March 23, i868, 2 young men, i aged, i middle-aged, =4 bodies. February 21, 1868. xxii. Old Romano-British man, large skull with long bones. Copper stain on left ulna, immediately to N.E. of grave xviii, so that the Roman tiles found in taking out the skeleton were supposed to belong to this skeleton. A good deal of charcoal and decayed wood was found near the head, but not near the legs nor pelvis. Of elongated type. Femur, 18-4; ulna, 10-3. The man, however, who took out the tiles supposed them to belong to Anglo-Saxon No. xviii. In the cases described by Wanner (' Das Alemannische Todtenfeld bei Schleitheim,' 1867, pp. 13, 16; 'Archiv fur Anthrop.' ii. 3, p. 356), Roman tiling was similarly employed. In some cases the graves were, as here, so close as to have only a single tile as a wall between them. See xxii of Jan. 6, 1869. xxiii. Old ifomaM (? old man). Skull and long bones. Femur, 17; humerus, 12-2; radius, 8-9 ; ulna, 9-5 ; stature, 5-4. This is a very old skeleton, and I think the sex may be doubtful, but it is probably, from lower jaw's muscular markings, a male. The forehead is vertical, but perhaps abnormally; the vertex is cari- nate. Globose type. xxiv. Shall of old woman, with five coins; one of Valens, and one of Constans I. Flint, ball-shaped, chipped. Flat flint and Roman pottery. Femur, 15.6 ; tibia, : 2-4; radius, 8-4. Lower jaw nearly destroyed by water-wear. Elongated type. XXV. Man, prime of life. Frontal suture patent. xxvi. Fragmentary cranium of old person; bones of young person of eighteen to twenty wrongly assigned to it. xxvii. Long calvaria, man prime of life. Lower jaw a good deal water-worn, and the long bones lost, perhaps destroyed by decay. xxviii. Infant. xxix. Child, first dentition complete. I child, first dentition complete, i infant, 2 men, prime of life, 2 old men, i old woman, i old, doubtful of which sex, prob. male, i young person, 18-20, = 9 bodies, counting xxvi as two. March 4, 1868. i. Skeleton of Bomano-British woman, adult, of globose type, like No. xi of April i, 1868. Skull larger and more strongly made than most female skulls, and a nearer approximation to male skulls of same type. Teeth considerably worn ; no wisdom teeth developed. Orthognathous, with posterior sagittal furrow. Femur, 16-2 ; tibia, 13-4 ; humerus, 11.2 ; stature, 5 ft. 8.10 in. I adult woman. March 17,1868. i. Skull, with long bones and patellae, of a very strong young man, buried with frag- ments of Roman pottery, black and red, and nail, with wood adhering to it, from coffin. Femur, 18.5 ; humerus, 13-3. Skull, flat and bro:id, to be reconstructed. Hyoid fully ossified. Elongated type. ii. Skull of old man, with femur, and tibiae, and nails near head. Of elongated, flat type. Large. Very large bones. Femur, 18-9.

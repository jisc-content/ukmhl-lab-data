709 MEDICINE IN MODERN TIMES. safely be tried; if carbolic acid can be safely introduced into a wounded pleural cavity, assuredly we need not hesitate about the passing of it into a bladder. Thus many scientific researches, undertaken in the first instance for the elucidation of speculative truth, and for the rectification not of unsound organs and func- tions but of unsound theories and explanations, and prosecuted throughout by the aid of the most refined methods and instru- ments, come ultimately to bear upon such matters as catheterisa- tion and alkalescent urine. I would not, however, be thought to undervalue the worth of researches carried on at whatever cost with the sole object of procuring correct notions as to the way in which processes, even wholly beyond our power of modification, have been and are being carried on. It is a great and positive gain when we get rid of one false hypothesis, one single false formula which by frequent repetition has attained to the dignity of a philosophic axiom, and acquired a sort of prescriptive right to ' warp us from the living truth.' The Chemists, as I am informed, are conspiring to efiect what the old Greeks would have called a 'Catalysis' of the kingdom of 'Catalysis' itself, and its banish- ment to the Limbo of Vanity, there to herd with Phlogiston and many other and younger as well as older unsubstantial Idola Theatri; and though these alterations^ of theory may not as yet have affected the oxygen we breathe, nor even have enabled us as yet to regulate with any greater precision the processes of fermenta- tion with which we have for so many ages had an empirical familiarity, they have given us at least a warning as to maintaining always that proper diffidence as to the all-sufficient validity of our theories, by whomsoever pro-ttiulgated or endorsed, which is so constantly of avail in actual practical work. The phaenomena, let me add, to account for which the hypothesis of Pangenesis has been recently (Darwin, ' Animals and Plants under Domestication,' 1868, ii. p. 403) put forward provisionally, are, and will, we may believe, always remain, beyond our control; but there will be no one, I suppose, who will not feel an interest in observing how the revelations in the all but infinite divisibility of' germinal matter/ which we owe to Professor Beale, may come to bear upon the explanation of the marvellous phaenomena of reproduction and hereditary transmission. Nor can I leave this subject without re- marking that it is in great probability upon the self-multiplication of

756 THE HARVEIAN ORATION. muscular character, and so much else, was already to be found in the writings or teachings of his predecessors ? To all this we can answer, as indeed, it seems probable, was practically answered even within Harvey's lifetime, what was left for Harvey to discover was nothing less than the circulation itself. His predecessors had but impinged, and that by guesswork, upon different segments of the circle, and then gone off at a tangent into outer darkness, whilst he worked and proved and demonstrated round its entire periphery. His demonstrations and direct proofs were all new, and his indirect arguments nearly all new. Whenever he made use of anything already known, he most punctually acknowledged it. Of his de- monstration in the way of injection I have already spoken; of his demonstration of the use of the valves in the veins, and his proof that they are similar in function to the arterial, a fact previously unsuspected (see p. 65, I.e.), the thirteenth chapter of the treatise ' De Motu' speaks with figures; of his indirect, but irrefragable argument, in the eighth chapter, from tlie quantity of blood thrown out by the heart at each pulsation, an argument which a mathe- matician such as Harriott, or Warner, might have hit upon, but, so far as I have found, did not, he speaks himself as being 'adeo novum et inauditum ut verear ne habeam inimicos omnes homines;' and finally, the argument, which though it be indirect, every morphologist will allow to be not only most exquisite, but also most convincing, for the circulation in the adult warm-blooded animal, drawn from the relations held by the venae cavae to the efferent arteries in the embryo, and in all animals with but a single or an imperfectly divided ventricle, ' unus duntaxat ventriculus vel quasi unus,' and of which I would recommend every one who is not already acquainted with it, to gain a knowledge from the seventh chapter of the same book, was his, and his alone. With regard to all these points, with regard, that is, to the circulation as a whole; with regard to the actual demonstration and exhibition of it as opposed to mere guessing about it; with regard to all, or nearly all, sound reasoning as to any large portion of it, Harvey might have said with Lucretius, 'Avia Pieridum peragro loca nullius ante Trita solo'; or in the words of a poet of another country, and a later age, 'We were the first that ever burst Into that silent sea.'

PREHISTORIC TIMES IN BRITAIN. 547 III. Stis verrucosus, var. cerarnica. Brit. Mus. 712 rf. 'Skull, adult. A wild boar from Ceram. Collected by Mr. Wallace.' Of this skull I have noted that its third molar is comparatively simple, whereas the other specimens of Sus voTucostis in the British Museum have it complex. All the other specimens of Sus verrucosus catalogued p. 330, Catalogue 1869, as Sus ven'ucosus, with the exception of No. 1362 ti, which was received from Mr. Wallace as Sus rittatus, have been noted by me as having the lacrymal long in relation to its height, and as having complex molars. As, however, Nathusius, I. c. p. 179, has noted the lacrymal to be short in a specimen obtained by him from Java, and as, of two skulls figured by Solomon Miiller ('Verhandl.' tab. 32. figs. 2 and 4), one has the lacrymal short and the other long, it is clear that this species varies in this matter. The closely allied species Sus celehensis cannot be said quite certainly, from MiiUer's pi. 28 his, fig. 3, to have, or not to have, the long lacrymal usually found in the pigs with facial warts. Height of lacrymal i-o in.; malar border 0-75 in. IV. Stis harhatiis, Borneo. SkuU of Sus harbatus. 1519 d, 0. U. Museum. Figured plate V. fig. 7. Height of lacrymal 1.2 in.; malar border 1.2 in. SkuU of Sus harbatus. Procured in Borneo by the Rev. C. Spencer Bubb. Height of lacrjrmal 1.2 in.; malar border 1.2 in. SkuU oiSus harbatus. British Museum, 712 a; caUed Euhys harbatus, Hand-list, P- 58.1873- Height of lacrymal I • 15 in.; malar border i in. In Sus harbatus the lacrymo-frontal ridge is not very prominent, though recog- nisable : in the shortness of the lacrymal, which is a constant character in this species, so far as recorded in S. Miiller's figures and elsewhere, and in the characters of the naso'&ontal suture, it resembles Sus cristatus and its allies rather than Sus tcrofa. BIBLIOGRAPHY.

634 EXCAVATIONS IN AN ANCIENT like the words 'Frank' and 'Aleman,' to denote social or con- federative, rather than genealogical, community; and, though we are warned thus in limine against any premature attempt to har- monise the results of philological with those of craniographical enquiry, it may not be entirely hopeless to attempt to harmonise the traditions which tell us that the Romanised town populations, the ' Lloegrians,' took the side of the Saxons against their own countrymen, with the facts of our ' finds' in cemeteries. Now, these facts, as they have presented themselves to me, I have, with the help of light borrowed from many other investigators, read thus. Two varieties of capacious crania, one dolichocephalic and the other brachycephalic, have been found by me in cemeteries referable by their archaeological characters to the periods cor- responding with, and immediately subsequent to the close of the Roman domination in England. These two varieties of skulls are not ordinarily found occupying one and the same tumulus, at least with the relative positions which the remains of two races in- habiting the same district peacefully usually hold to each other, and I incline, though but doubtfully, to anticipate that evidence will be ultimately produced to identify the dolichocephali in ques- tion with the Lloegrian traitors, and the brachycephali with that portion of the Kymry which preferred exile to the Saxon yoke. The fact of the dolichocephali having been found abundantly (see p. 624, supra) in the Suffolk region of the Littus Saxonicum, where the Celt and Saxon are not known to have met as enemies when East Anglia became a kingdom, is not without its significance. Their geographical distribution may indicate a greater political pliability just as their greater variety of cranial conformation in- dicates a greater anatomical plasticity. In the same cemeteries with both of these varieties of skulls I have found skulls which are very closely similar to Professor Huxley's ' River-bed' type of skull, and which I should be inclined to think may have belonged to a serf, or at all events to a poor, population, whose necessities may have made them as indifferent as any similar population is now to the political leanings of their masters. I should agree with Professor Huxley in considering this a very ancient form of cranium; but, though I should allow, with a knowledge of the great aptitude for modification possessed by the human cranium, that it may be connected by transitional forms with the dolichocephalic Celtic

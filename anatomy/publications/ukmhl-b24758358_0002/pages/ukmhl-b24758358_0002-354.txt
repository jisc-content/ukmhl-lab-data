840 MODIFICATIONS OF ASPECTS OF ORGANIC NATURE influence of a false alarm many times in the day/ Surely whatever the biped, who can foresee and ponderate, may think of the lot and the future of the domestic Ruminants, their lot, to themselves, as they are not troubled with anticipations, totals up an aggregate of comfort and even of enjoyment far exceeding that which the majority of wild graminivorous creatures of similar bulk ever obtain. A flock of well-fed Cheviots, on a snowy moor, in all their hornless- ness and helplessness as against violence, shows the traveller that he is in a country whence wolves have entirely disappeared ; would their lot be happier if they were exposed not merely to the winds and sleets of Northumbria, but also to the attacks of wolves to which even in France and Germany they would be liable ? We need not, however, travel in South Africa, as you have done, to prove the point that dog-fights and bull-fights, cockpits and shambles notwithstanding, domestication has, on the whole, increased the sum of the happiness of the lower animals. Let us by an easy effort of imagination figure to ourselves what would become of the flocks and herds of sheep and oxen, 'even very much cattle,' which are now living with as large a share of enjoyments as, and a very much larger share of leisure at least than many of their masters, if those masters were one and all to be swept away by some epidemic. Suppose, as Dr. Roberts in his memoir on * Spontaneous Generation' (p. 39) has suggested, that the ferment which produces some one or other of our worse forms of infectious disease should ' sport,' as it is playfully styled, or vary, as a peach may sport or vary into a nectarine; and then suppose that the in- creased malignity and infectiousness with which it might thus become endowed, should as entirely destroy our own species within these Islands, as of late years disease has been known to entirely depopulate certain Polynesian islets, or as some analogously-de- veloped disease may be supposed to have exterminated the horse in South America within recent geological periods. There can be very little doubt in the mind of anybody who has much experience of the power of combination for mischief which dogs can, indepen- dently of men, develope, even in a civilised and thickly populated country, that in a few days after our disappearance they would be masters of the country. The mere desire for blood which is so eminently characteristic of the musteline carnivores would very shortly and certainly show itself again in our old servants in their

XXIX. ON THE CAT OF THE ANCIENT GREEKS. In a book, with, the existence of which I became acquainted a, few days ago, by a reference in Aubert and Wimmer's new edition of Aristotle's' Historia Animalium/ and which, through the kindness of Mr, Sclater, I have had put into nay hands this day, I have come upon certain statements which confirm not only certain of the conclusions, but certain also of the conjectures put forward by me in the ' Journ. of Anat. and Phys.,' Nov. 1867 (Article XXVIII).

I need not point out the bearing of these statements upon those advanced by me in that article. But I will take this opportunity of saying that Dr. Erhard's little volume deserves to be better known than it is at present in England. Besides giving us an excellent example and a ' simple case ' for the study of the rationale of the Distribution of Species, it teaches us the very important, and not a little needed lesson of caution, in receiving catalogues of indigenous animals of any area, however small and accessible, as being necessarily exhaustive. Though the vegetation of the Cyclades is (p. 7) of such a character that a hare can hardly hide itself from the eye of the eagle, and though at first. Dr. Erhard was (p. 8) inclined to think their mammalian fauna was as exclusively Adullaraite as that of a coral island, he has, after an L 1 a

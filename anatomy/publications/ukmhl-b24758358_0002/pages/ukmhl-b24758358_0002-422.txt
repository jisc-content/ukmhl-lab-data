THE EXAMINATION SYSTE-M AND THE 908 g-lad to have the opportunity of saying from so good a standing- point or vantage-ground. Accordingly, I wish to say a few words upon one subject, amongst others, to which I have of late devoted a very considerable amount of my very fully occupied time—to wit, the Examination System and the pre-requisites of candi- dature. The system of requiring certificates of attendance at lectures and upon other courses of instruction, and the examination system, are two very distinct means intended to co-operate towards one end—that, namely, of securing to the public that its future physicians and surgeons shall, firstly, have had certain opportuni- ties, and, secondly, have made certain use of them. I must not fail to add, what will disabuse any, either old or young, of the idea that I have anything very revolutionary to propose—namely, that these two systems are necessary as much in the interests of the future doctor as in those of his future patients, and that without some such apparatus and machinery as that which they represent, many a man would lose chances of forming in himself habits of attention, indispensable for any success, or indeed any virtue, which chances may never recur. Indeed, it is a matter of common obser- vation, at least of possible common observation, and I would it were matter of more common remark, that it is necessary not only for the acquirement of habits which belong only in part to our intel- lectual nature, but even for the acquirement of purely intellectual accomplishments, that certain kinds of work should be done at certain times and fixed periods in a boy's, in a young, or in an older man's life. Languages can be gained with greater facility before the age of twenty-five than they can ever afterwards; and the same may, I am inclined to believe, be said of the power of recognising and recollecting specific differences in zoology and botany. It is well that the same natural restriction does not invariably exist as to the power of mastering that of which, however, it is of more importance that early mastery should be gained than of almost any other subject—to wit, mathematics. These are the words of a man whose experience and success as an educator has been great, not intended, it is true, for the particular case we deal with, and applying only in the way of analogy, but forcible in that way and appropriate :— ' There is but a certain time allotted for each thing to be done that we have to do, whether it belongs to this world or the other,

XLVIII. ON TYPHOID OR ENTERIC FEVER IN INDIAN GAOLS, AND ON THE RELATIONS OF THAT DISEASE AND OF CHOLERA TO THE DRY- EARTH SYSTEM OF CONSERVANCY. De. Buchanan, in the Appendix (No. 4, pp. 96, 97, 106) to the Twelfth Report of the Medical Officer of the Privy Council (for 1869, published in 1870), has thrown doubt upon the validity of certain reasonings of mine (in 'The Lancet,'March 20th, 1869, pp. 411, 412) as to the possibility of a dry-earth system of con- servancy favouring the spread of typhoid (or enteric or pythogenic) fever. One of my arguments having been based upon the fact that fever spread in the gaols of India in spite of the introduction into them of that system for dealing with excreta^ Dr. Buchanan objects that this argument is of no cogency unless it be shown that the Indian fever in question is enteric and not typhus fever. When I wrote I was of opinion that this Indian gaol fever was enteric and not typhus, and further investigation has confirmed me in this belief. In 1869 I did not think it necessary to lay any emphasis upon this point, for I thought it was a settled, received, and established belief. Dr. Murchison, in his chapter on the ' Geographical Dis- tribution of Typhus Fever ' (p. 58 of ' A Treatise on the Continued Fevers of Great Britain,' 1862), had said that there were 'no authentic records of typhus, such as we see it in this country, having been met with in Asia, Africa, or the tropical parts of America.' If, in the same connexion, Dr. Murehison allows that the ' Pali disease ' and the true bubonic plague may be analogous to, if not identical with, typhus, I have to say that between typhus as thus locally represented and the gaol fevers as described in the Indian gaols there is scarcely a single point in common; and if

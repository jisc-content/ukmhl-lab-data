Fig. 2.—Heart of Sheep. The right ventricle is laid open. The letter M indicates the moderator band. A probe has been passed between the chordae teiidineae, passing from a musculus papillaris arising from the movable wall of the ventricle to the two main segments of the tricuspid valves and the outer wall of the veVitricle. Such being the function of this moderator band, what is its mor- phological bearing, and what traces can we find of it in ourselves, tempting us to speculate as to the nature of the secret bond which brings us into relations of affinity not only with the mammalian class, 3 B 2

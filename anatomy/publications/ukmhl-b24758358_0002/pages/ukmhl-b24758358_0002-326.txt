oi^ MODIFICA.TIONS OF ASPECTS OF ORaANIC NATURE extent, as measured by latitude and longitude as well as by other gauges, to which the world has been modified by his migrations and importations. Let us now enumerate the twenty domesticated mammals which we possess, and which for practical purposes may be taken as makmg up a tale of about twenty or twenty-one; let me specify which amongst them belong, as regards their origin, to the Palae- arctie region, and to the restricted portion of it already dwelt upon and defined, as the maps show you; and thirdly, leaving consider- ations of locality and of number, let me contrast the value of nine, ten, or eleven mammals which man domesticated in that district with that of the others acquired from ^ or contributed by all the other regions of the globe taken together. Our twenty-one chief domesticated mammals may be enumerated in something like order of merit and necessity to us as follows: the dog, the cow, the sheep, the pig, the horse, the cat, the goat, the ass, the camel, the dromedary, the buffalo, the alpaca, the vicugna, the reindeer, the zebu, the banteng, the yak, the ferret, the rabbit, the mongoose, and the guinea-pig, omitting some few species the im- portance of which as being locally limited to very small areas, and as consisting of individuals numerically few, is too small to make it necessary to notice them. Representatives of more than one- half of this list can be fairly claimed by the Palaearctic centre of creation as owing their parentage to stocks native to its soil; this half consisting of the dog, the cow, the sheep, the pig, the horse, the goat, the camel, the dromedary, the reindeer, the ferret, and the rabbit. I have said ' representatives' of one-half of this list because it is more than probable that some of our breeds of domestic dogs and of pigs may have been reclaimed from wild parent-stocks in other regions of the world. There can, however, be no reasonable doubt that the great majority of the domestic breeds known till comparatively recent times in Europe, of each of these two animals, the dog and the pig, were drawn from parent-stocks living in ' It is a curious point in mythology that, so far as my memory serves me, no god nor demigod should have the credit assigned him of having domesticated any animal except the horse. Of course this fact, if fact it be, shows two things with more or less proba,bility; firstly, namely, that these acquisitions were made in very far-off times, not merely in 'the ages before morality,' but in those much earlier ones, 'the ages before history;' and secondly, that the acquisition of the horse was made in later days than the domestication of the other animals in question.

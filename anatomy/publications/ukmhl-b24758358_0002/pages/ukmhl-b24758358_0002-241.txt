MEDICINE IN MODERN TIMES. 727 and hope always to remain, to regret or deprecate change as snch. For there is a philosophy of both subjects, and a science also in both; and I would hope that both the one and the other might still retain a lien on the two words and the two things, nor suffer its rival to establish a claim for sole possession by its own default in exercising a right of usage. Advocates of the dignity of man are wont to regard, or to profess to regard, with something like horror, doctrines which would hint that either his bodily structures or his mental faculties, his ' more pure and nobler pare,' may have attained their perfection in the way of gradational evohition. But it is not clear to me that the- horror expressed for these conclusions is nauch more legitimate than the arguments with which they have been assailed by Prime Ministers and others, in the Sheldonian Theatre close by, and else- where within our precincts.

I believe, however, that, if men would take as much and the same care in these psychological questions as the physiologist does in his experiments and observations, to overlook none of the conditions and circumstances of the entire complex of phaenomena upon which they undertake to decide, they would come to see that above, and often behind, but always beside and beyond the whirl of his emotions and the smoothly fitting and rapidly playing machinery of his ratiocinative and other mental faculties, there stands for each man a single undecomposable something—to wit, himself. This something lives in his consciousness, moves in his will> and knows that for the employment and working of the entire apparatus of feelings and reasoning it is individually and indivisibly responsible. Its utterances have but a still small voice, and the

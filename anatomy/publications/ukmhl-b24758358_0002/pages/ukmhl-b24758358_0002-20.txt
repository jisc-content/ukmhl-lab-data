Thirdly: Strabo's words, iii. 386, quoted by Schneider, 1. c, iii. p. 524, and relating to the taking of rabbits, kql brj kui yaXai aypCas hs ri At/SvTj rpe'^et (pepovcriv eiriTrjbii, hs (fiipLoiaavTes -napCaaiv ds ras o-rras. al 8' i^iXKovatv e^co rots ovv^iv, prove, I suppose, beyond a question, that yaXrj stood for ferret, Mustela furo, as well as for the martens, as early as the Christian era. Fourthly: as one kind of yaXri was known as the TapTr](raCa yaXr}, and as the Scholiasts tell us ^ Tapr-qaatav was used avrl tov fxeyaX-qv, and as Herodotus informs us, iv. 192, that yaXai very like these Tartessian (or larger) yaXal were to be seen in Libya, where we know any animal like and larger than a marten would be a viverra, I think we may with some little probability suppose that the TapTr](TaLa , yaXfj was nothing less or else than the Viverra genetta, which is found all over Africa and also in the South of Spain and France, where it is domesticated even now, here and there, and acts as a tolerable eat. I have not been able to find that this animal is known in Greece, it is not included by Blasius in his ' Saugethiere Mitteleuropas;' whence we can the better undei'stand why it was called TapTrjaaCa yaXrj; though, it is found in Asia Minor, whither it may have found ^ its way from Egypt. If the Herpestes wid- ringtoni, recently found ^ in the Sierra Morena, had been as well known in the region of Tartessus as the Viverra genetta, its claims to be considered as the TaprrjaaCa yaXrj would perhaps have been as much greater as its size is. But the Pharaoh's Rat, which would then have been the yaXrj of Herodotus as being the repre- sentative of the Spanish Herpestes, would have been contrasted with it in the point of being considerably smaller, which however is not the case. I append measurements of these and of certain other of the animals of which I have spoken in this paper, the point of size being the point in which the Tartessian or Spanish Marten is contrasted with the commoner one by the Scholiast, and being, as it seems to me, sufficiently great to mask the difference which the lateral and the caudal striping of the Genet also consti- tutes between it and the yaXal of Greece. 1 See Aristoph.

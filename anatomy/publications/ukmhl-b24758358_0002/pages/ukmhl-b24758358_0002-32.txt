522 ON THE DOMESTIC PIG OF the enunciation of tliis statement as being- definitely proved, his objection amounts to little more than saying that Sus leucomystax is probably not specifically distinct from Sus viltatus, which Nathu- sius himself holds to be the parent stock of Sus indicus. My own views, as based upon the data available to me, are to the following- effect:â€”The prehistoi-ic domestic swine which have come into my hands appear to me to be more nearly affined to Sus scrofa than to any of the Asiatic wild swine with which I am acquainted ; secondly, without wishing to affirm absolutely that too much weight has been laid by Nathusius upon the shortness of the lacry- mal for differentiating Sus indicus, as we now see it, from Sus scrofa and its progeny, I am inclined to think that sub-equality, if not actual equality, between the malar and the orbital borders of the lacrymal bone may be found in prehistoric skulls of the Sus scrofa, yax.ferus, and especially in the female skulls of that variety of S/is which, in other points, such as the slenderness of the snout, differ from the ' Torfschwein,' the representative in those times of Sus indicus, according to Rutimeyer; and, thirdly, I think it is possi- ble to show that, whilst Sus cristaius, Sus leucomystax, Sus vittatus, and Sus iimorensis form a closely connected group of Suidae non verrucosi, with which, again, Sus andamanensis and Sus papuensis are to be allied, all these sub-species differ in points of considerable if not of specific value from Sus verrucosus of Java, from Sus celehensis, and, finally, from Sus scrofa of the Palaearctic region as well as from the non-verrucose Sus barbaius of Borneo. It may be well to begin with this latter point first, and to show that the group of Eastern pigs, of which the wild pig of India, the Malay peninsula, and the Lancay Islands, Sus cristaius, may be taken as a type, is always distinguishable from Sus scrofa, Ya,Y.ferus, of Europe, and Asia north of the Himalayas. This view is not equivalent to one which should lay it down as certain that they are specifically distinct, a question which it is not proposed to raise here. I should agree, however, with Mr. Jerdon, whose book on the Mammals of India, 1874, came into my hands subsequently to the formation of my opinion, in holding that the Indian wild hog was ' as worthy of specific distinction as many other recognised species' (I.e. p. 241), though this is not to say much. I should not, however, entirely accept his statement to the effect that the head of the Indian wild hog was longer and more pointed than

XLIII. BIOLOGICAL TRAINING AND STUDIES, AN ADDRESS DELIVERED TO THE BIOLOGICAL SECTION OF THE BRITISH ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE. • Amongst the duties of a President of a Section the delivery of an Address has in these latter days somehow come to be reckoned ; and that I may interpose myself for hut as short a time as possible between your attention and the papers announced to you for read- ing upon your list, I will begin what I have to say without any further preface. I wish first to make a few observations as to the kind of prepara- tion which is indispensable, as it seems to me, as a preliminary to an adequate and intelligent comprehension of the problems of biology; or, in other words, to an adequate and intelligent com- prehension of the discussions which will take place in this room and in the two other rooms which will be assigned to, and occupied by, the department of Ethnology and Anthropology, and that of Physiology pure and proper, with Anatomy. Having made these observations, I propose, in the second place, to enumerate the subjects which appear likely to occupy prominent places in our forthcoming discussions ; and thirdly, I will, if your patience allows me, conclude with some remarks as to certain of the benefits which may be expected, as having been constantly observed to flow from a due and full devotion to biological study. In the first place, then, I wish to say that though the problems of biology have much of what is called general interest (that is to say, of interest for all persons) attaching to them,—as, indeed, how could they fail to have, including as they do the natural history of our own and of all other species of living organisms, whether animal or vegetable?—some special preparation must be gone through if that general interest is to be thoroughly and intelli- gently gratified. I would compare the realm of biology to a vast landscape in a cultivated country of which extensive views may be

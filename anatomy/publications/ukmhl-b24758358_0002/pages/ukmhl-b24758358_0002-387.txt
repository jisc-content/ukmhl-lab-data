873 BIOLOGICAL TRAINING AND STUDTFS. there has been from age to age a growth in man's power over nature, which no degrading- influences have been able permanently to check.' I must not trespass into the province of the botanist, but I should be glad to say that no easier method of learning how the natural history sciences can be made to bear upon the history of man, as a whole, can be devised than that furnished by the perusal of such memoirs as those of Unger's upon the plants used for food by man. The very heading and title of the paper I am specially referring to appears to me to have an ambiguity about it which, in itself, is not a little instructive. In that title, ' Botanische Streifzlige auf dem Gebiete der Cultur-Geschichte,' the latter word may be taken, I imagine, etymologically at least, to refer either to culture proper, or to floriculture, or to agriculture. At any rate, the paper itself may be read in the Sitzungsberichte of the Vienna Academy for 1859 ; it has, I suppose, superseded the interesting chapters in Link's 'Urwelt und Alterthum,' of date i8ai; and it is not unlikely, I apprehend, to be itself, in its turn, superseded also. Coming, in the fhird place, to Zoology, I suppose I shall be justified in saying that the largest issue which has been raised in the current year, an issue for the examination of the data for deciding which the two months of July and August which are just past may have furnished persons now present with opportunities, is the question of the kinship of the Ascidians to the Vertebrata. There is or was nothing better established till the appearance of Kowalewsky's paper, now about four years ago, than the existence of a wide gulf between the two great divisions of the animal kingdom, the Vertebrata and the In vertebrata: nothing could be more revolutionary than the views which would obviously rise out of his facts; and within the present year these facts have been abundantly confirmed by Prof. Kupfer, whose very cleai-ly written and beautifully illustrated paper has just appeared in the current number of Schultze's 'Archiv fiir microscopische Anatomic.' Kupfer's researches have been carried on u^po'a Ascidia canina ; but they more than confirm the accuracy of what Kowalewsky had stated to take place in Ascidia mammillata, and which may be summed up briefly thus:â€”In the larval Ascidian we have in its caudal appendages an axis skeleton clearly analogous, if not essentially homologous, to the chorda dorsalis of the vertebrate embryo, as consisting, like it, of

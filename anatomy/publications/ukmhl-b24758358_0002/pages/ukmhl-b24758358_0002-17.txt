DOMESTIC CATS. 507 in the writings of any author who flourished, if authors did flourish, in the years which rolled so drearily away between the days of Evagrius and those of the author of this tragi-comedy. The word muslela seems, I may say, in leaving this part of my subject, nearly always, if not quite, to stand for a weasel of one kind or another; though Phsedrus does once, namely iv. i. 9, use the word in a passage homologous with one of those in which we find aXkovpos used in the fables ascribed to JEsop. This latter word^ on the other hand, seems always to stand for a Felis domesticus or catus; whilst Fdis in the Latin writers does seem, according to Facciolati, to be used indiSerently, or nearly so, for either FeHne or Musteline. The argument to show that our white-breasted Marten, Mustela foina, \vas used for the same domestic purposes by the ancients as the Felis domesticus is by ourselves, may be briefly stated thus. An animal called yoKri by Aristotle (' Hist. Anim.' ii, 3. 5, vi. 30. 2, viii. 37. 2, ix. 2. 9, ib. 7. 4), and repeatedly referred to by Aristo- phanes and other Greek writers of the best ages, as well as by the Scholiasts ^, under this title and in more or less completely pro- verbial expressions, is spoken of as destroying mice, snakes, lizards, birds and birds' eggs, as being the reverse of odoriferous, as ^ Aristophanes, 'Acharn.' 255 :— KaKvoiijaeTai ya\ds ffov fii]5iv rjTTov 0duy. ♦Plutua' 693 :— VTTo TOV Sfovs ^Seovffa SpipiVTepov yaXijs.

Mr. Max MuUer teils me that in the ' Hitopadesa' an animal, called Nakula, kills the serpent under the same provocation and with the same reward as the hound kills the wolf in our story of Llewellyn.

833 PRODUCED BY MAN. Nillson^ has averred to be eminently characteristic of savages. I subjoin the entire passage, iv. 172 2, for several reasons, in the original Greek; and I submit that a people who embodied so much of wild life in their social condition, could have learnt little from any of the nations to the east of them, whether Egyptian, Arabian, Assyrian, or Persian. But as regards their dealing with the date- palms, we have this remarkable statement made by Herodotus, iv. 172 and 186: 'In the summer they leave their flocks by the sea- side, and go up to the district Augila, to get in the harvest of the date-palms which grow there in great abundance, and are of great size, all being fruit-bearing.' Now Herodotus, and, as he tells us, i. 193, the Greeks of his time generally, were acquainted with the bisexual dioecious character of the palm and the fig ; that the Baby- lonians used artificial means for securing the impregnation of the pistilliferous trees he tells us in loco ; and we know that those latter were, as they are (see Kaempfer, 1. c. p. 672) still, to be found in Persia as they are (see Martins, 1. c. p. 264) still in Egypt. Some considerable weight, therefore, may fairly be assigned to his statement, iv. 172, to the effect that at Augila (as also probably, see iv. 183, in the country of the Garamantes) there were none but * 'Early Inhabitants of Scandinavia,' Eng.Trans, ed. Lubbock,p. 167: 'Aristocracy is strongly developed amongst all savage nations.' * As regards the size of the Fezzan dates, the dates of the Garamantes referred to by Herodotus, iv. 183, as living ten days' journey from Augila westwards, and as having (poiviKts KapTro<p6poi iroWot KaTavfp Kal kv roiai ertpotcn, we have the following information from Dr. Ed.

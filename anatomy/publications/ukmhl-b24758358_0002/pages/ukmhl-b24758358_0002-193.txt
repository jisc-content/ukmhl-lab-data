XXXYII. ON THE STEUCTUEE OE EOUND AND LONG BAEEOWS. Professor Rolleston read papers to the British Association, September, 1880, On the Structure of Hound and Long Barrows, his remarks being illustrated by a number of diagrams. Premising that one of his objects was to preserve barrows from being spoilt, and thus to prevent the destruction of certain links in the history of our species, he described the construction of barrows which he had explored, and urged the absolute necessity of very great care being exercised in such exploration. Speaking of urn burials in round barrows, he briefly referred to the question of the cremation of bodies, and the idea of it. Why did the people burn their dead ? He believed tbe idea was thisâ€”that all savage races, when they had to deal with an enemy, were exceedingly prone to wreak certain ignominies on dead bodies. Burning the bodies put it right out of the power of the enemy to do this, and the urn enabled people to carry away their friends who were so burnt. In time of pestilence it became actually necessary for sanitary considerations to burn the dead, and it was only in time of plague or war that we found that cremation or burning became the order of the day, and that was readily explicable by the fact that men always did what they could on the principle of least action, because burning was a troublesome process. Any universality of burning was explained by the fact that ancient history was simply one great catalogue of plague, and pestilence, and war, and the like. Of course he was an enemy to cremation, because it did a great deal of harm, preventing us from knowing what sort of people our pre- decessors were. Professor Rolleston chronicled the finding in a

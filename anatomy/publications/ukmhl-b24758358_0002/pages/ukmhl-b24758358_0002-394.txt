XLIV. ADDRESS ON ANTHROPOLOGY, DELIVEKED TO THE ANTHROPOLOGICAL DEPARTMENT OF THE BRITISH ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE, Some few weeks ago Mr. James Parker, of Oxford, invited me to visit your Somersetshire eaves, in the company of the Warwickshire Naturalists' and Archaeologists' Field Club. It struck me that I should do well, as I was to preside over the Anthropological Department at this British Association Meeting, if I tried to learn as much as I could of the relies and of the surroundinors of the Prehistoric inhabitants of your neighbourhood ; and for this, as well as for other reasons^ I gladly accepted the invitation. During that pleasant midsummer excursion, I was more than once im- pressed with the similarity which its incidents bore to those of the undertaking in which we are now engaged, and, indeed, to those of the study of Anthropology generally. First, the organisation of the expedition had entailed some considerable amount of labour upon those who had charged themselves with that duty; and, secondly, a thorough exploration of the recesses and sinuosities of the several caves which we explored devolved upon us not only a good deal of exertion, but even some slight amount of risk ; for the passages and galleries along which we worked our way were sometimes low and narrow, often steep, and nearly always slippery.

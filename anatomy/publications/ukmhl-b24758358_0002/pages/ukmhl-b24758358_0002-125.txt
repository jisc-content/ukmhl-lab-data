CEMETERY AT PRILFOED. 611 VI. Conclusions suggested hy an Bxamination of the Human Bemains found at Frilford. The cranial and other osteological peculiarities of the human remains which I have examined from the Frilford cemetery seem to me to throw sometimes a very unambiguous, and sometimes, it must be confessed, a more or less questionable light upon certain of the moot points in the political and natural history of the period in which their owners lived. Among those points may be specially mentioned the often-raised and very variously answered questions, as to the extent to which ^ the Anglo-Saxon Conquest was equivalent to an extirpation of the population previously in oc- cupation of this country^, and as to the physical and more par- ticularly the cranial characters of the Romans and Romanized Britons. But it is worthy of note that very indubitable evidence, at least as to some of the social and moral peculiarities^, of the conquered and the conquering races respectively, may be gathered from a careful examination of their bony remains I have subjoined in a tabular form the results of my examination of the sometimes fairly complete, sometimes exceedingly incomplete, remains of 123 burnt or buried bodies which have come into my ' Tor the question of the extent to which the Celtic population were destroyed by the Saxon Invasions, see Pearson's ' History of England during the Early and Middle Ages,' i. 99-103, 1867 ; Freeman's 'Norman Conquest,'i. 18, 20; Akerman, 'Archae- ologia,'p. 38, Second Eeport, Brighthampton; Turner's 'Anglo-Saxon History,' i. 311; Wylie, 'Fairford Graves,' p. 8; Kemble's 'Saxons in England,' i. 21 ; D.

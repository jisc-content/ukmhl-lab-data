XL VI. THE EELATIVE VALUE OF CLASSICAL AND SCIENTIFIC TRAINING: BEING A EEVIEW OF DE. MAX V. PETTENKOFER'S WORK ' WODURCH die humani8tischen gymna8ien fur die universitat \'er- bereiten/ The German-reading public can possess itself at a very triflino- cost of a very weighty opinion as to tlie relative value of classical and of scientific training, by the purchase of an address delivered last December, in Munich, by Professor Max von Pettenkofer, in his capacity of Rector or Chancellor of the University for the time being. There is in existence an English document (we fear we cannot speak of it as a puhlicatioti) in the shape of a report, laid before the authorities of the Owens College, Manchester, which has appended to it a name nearly, or quite, as familiar to the student and readers of 'Nature' as Pettenkofer'sâ€”viz. that of Professor Roscoe, and in which the same process of ' ponderation' is applied to the classical ' Gymnasia' and the modern ' Real-Gymnasien ' severally. Von Pettenkofer, who is not referred to in that report, shall here speak for himself, and we may say at once, that after stating more or less fully the objections which are ordinarily urged against the classical system, he declares himself an adherent of the party which stands sujper antiquas vias. The two delegates of the Owens College appear to incline in the same direction somewhat, but are more eclectic and more careful in balancing their utterances as to the possibility of combining the two systems than either Von Pettenkofer, whom we shall forthwith cite on the one, or than Helmholtz, whom they cite on the other side.

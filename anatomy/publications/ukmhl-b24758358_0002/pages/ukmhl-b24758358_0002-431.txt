RELATIVE VALUE OF CLASSICAL AND SCIENTIFIC TRAINING. 917 The argument from authority has a legitimate place in questions concerning such matters as the genesis of culture and as the existence of capacity and capabilities; for in such questions neither the facts themselves nor the mode of their origination can be always looked upon as beyond the region of probability. But as we are writing in a scientific periodical, we will begin at least with something which admits of being quantitatively estimated ; and we will do this by giving the time-tables of the classical {Ihmanis- tischen) and of the modern {lieal-Gymnasien) schools in Bavaria, as we find them in Von Pettenkofer's address (pp. 5 and 18). In classical schools, out of 99 hours per week :— 8 hours per week are given to German. 26 „ „ Latin. 22 „ Greek. 8 „ „ French. (I, e. 64 hours, or 65 per cent., are given to languages, three-fourths being Latin and Greek, and one-fourth German and French.) 17 hours per week are given to Mathematics. 10 „ „ History. 8 „ „ Religious Instruction. In ' Real-Gymnasien,' out of 11 a hours per week :— 9 hours per week are given to German. 14 „ „ Latin. 13 >. .. French. 4 I. » English. (I. e. 40 hours, or 33 per cent., are given to languages, of which time only one-third is given to one ancient language, one-third to French, the other two-thirds to German.) 27 hours per week are given to Mathematics. (I. e, algebra, elementary geometry, trigonometry, descriptive and analytical geometry and higher analysis, taking 22 per cent, of the whole number.) 4 hours per week are given to History. 19 „ „ Natural Science and Geography. 24 „ „ Drawing and Modelling. 8 „ „ Religious Instruction. The ' Real-Gyranasien' are thus seen to exact 15 per cent, more hours than the classical schools; and it is by this increase on the one hand, coupled with a curtailment of the quota assigned to languages on the other, that time is found for mathematics and for

XXXV. FUETHER EESEAECHES IN AN ANGLO-SAXON CEMETEEY AT FEILFOED, WITH EEMARKS ON THE NORTHEEN LIMIT OF ANGLO- SAXON CEEMATION IN ENGLAND. The first discovery in the cemetery at Frilford, subsequent to those already recorded in the ^Archteologia,' xlii. pp. 417-485 (Article xxxiv), was made on March 22, 1869, when a leaden coffin was found, containing the bones of a young woman, with a toilet comb ^ at the right of the back of her head. This brings the number of leaden coffins found at Frilford up to five; one of them has already been figured in ' Archseologia,' xlii. pi. XXIV. figures 7 and 8. The second was the discovery of some fragments, which, when fitted to the three fragments found in September, 1867, one of which is figured in the ' Archjeologia,'xlii. pi. XXIII. fig. 2, p. 423, make up the larger portion of what is often called a ' holy-water vessel.' The fragments of September, 1867, were to my eyes so distinctly Saxon that I had one of them figured, and the unexpected discovery of the remaining fragments enabled us to build up the urn shown in the annexed woodcut. I imagine that a plough's coulter had knocked out the first discovered fragments. No burnt bones were found quite close to the urn, but one fragment was found a little way off 2. This reconstructed vessel may be compared with vessels of some- what similar shape, and possibly similar purpose, found in Roman ' For difference between toilet and other combs, see Anderson, ' Proc. Soc. Ant. Scot.' June 10, 1872, p. 551, and woodcut in loco. ^ The fragment, which with a triangular apex pointing upwards, occupies about the middle point in the front upper border of the urn figured above, is the same fragment which is figured with its apex pointing downwards, pi. XXIII. fig. 2, ' Arcli.ieologia,' xlii.

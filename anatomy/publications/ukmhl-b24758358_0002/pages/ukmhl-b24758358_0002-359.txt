PRODUCED BY MAN. 845 it was possible on many an oceanic island to recover links which had fallen out of the chain of evidence as to the origin of species which the older and larger continents of dry land had furnished ; it was possible also to elucidate the origin, humble and lowly enough, of our own civilisation by what we could see, and not less by what we might fail to discover, in the inchoate civilisations, in similar localities, of semi-savag-e men. The lines of intercommunication between the most distant parts of our globe, which the navigator with, in his own language, ' a steam-engine under his foot,' is daily weaving into a more and more nearly all-encompassing web, will very shortly have introduced so much of the most recent results of our modern civilisation into what were but lately the most secluded of localities as to rob them of that value and interest for the pur- suers of the knowledge specified, which they up to a few years ago so eminently possessed. These few years—for they will be but few—to come, have a great responsibility put upon them in the way of preserving those perish- able and destructible links in the history of the past, which may be made incandescent and luminous for the advancement of knowledge, and to some not inconsiderable extent for the benefiting of man's estate. In this work the Society, which has honoured me by inviting me to address them this evening, has borne a distinguished part in the past, and I cannot doubt, but, on the contrary, have many reasons for believing, that it will bear an increasingly important one in the future.

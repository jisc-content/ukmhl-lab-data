680 ON THE STRUCTUEE OP ROUND AND LONG BARE0W8. barrow of the Bronze period of a man laid out at full length, the general rule being that of burial in a contracted position. As regarded the date to be assigned to these things, he might give it as his opinion that no Roman ever used a bronze sword, nor crossed swords with an enemy using a sword of that material. As regarded the long barrows, that mode of burial stretched all the way from Wales to the Orkneys, and in them was found not a scrap of metal. His opinion was that the idea of the construction of these barrows was taken from limestone mountain headlands projecting into the sea, such as might be seen by a little trip in their immediate locality^. The men lived in caves, and the idea for the place of burial was taken from the place of living, it being often found that a man made the house in which he lived his burial-place. * [The Meeting of the British Association at which this paper was read, was held at Swansea.â€”Editok.]

XXXIX. JADE TOOLS IN SWITZERLAND. [The Geneva Correspondent of the 'Tunes' newspaper, Dec. 17, 1879, having re- ferred to tlie ' find' of a jade instrument in the bed of the Rhone in the course of excavations then being conducted, and having raised the question of the region from which the mineral Jade had been derived, a con-espondence extending over some weeks took place, in which Professor Max Miiller, Mr. Hodder M. Westropp, Dr. Eolleston, Professor Story-Maskelyne, Major Eaverty, and A. B. M. took part.

YouE correspondent Mr. H. M. Westropp calls the supposition that the jade tools found in the Swiss lake-dwellings came from the East ' a wild hypothesis.' Now, we must judge of the diffi- culties of the past by what we can see of the possibilities of the present, and I make bold to say that some thousands of men who read those words this morning must have had in their pockets implements which had travelled with the single individuals carry- ing them, in their single lifetimes, over much greater distances than this ' wild hypothesis' supposes the westward migrating Stone-Age men to have traversed in many generations. Hence I submit there is no a joriori improbability attaching to the view in question. This view is^ indeed, one of the best-established facts which recent prehistoric research has brought to light. So long ago as 1865, M. Fellenberg,/?6';-e, analysed four imple- ments of nephrite from Meilen and Concise, and one of jadeite from MooseedorfF, This nephrite was found to have precisely the same chemical composition as the well-known New Zealand nephrite, analysed by Scherer; and the jadeite to be similarly identical with the mineral known under that name from China, and analysed by

DOMESTIC CATS. 506 KUTTai; and I presume that the use of this expression shows with some degree of probability that tame cats were in use by this time in Constantinople. The date of Palladius is somewhat uncertain, though supposed with a good deal of probability to have been about the same as that of Caesarius, but as his local habitation appears to have been Italy, his words, iv. 9. 4, ' Contra talpas prodest catos frequenter habere in mediis conductis, mustelas habent plerique man- suetas,' are of importance. They show that the two kinds of cat were both in use as domesticated animals side by side and at the same time, in Italy, nine hundred years before the first of the Crusaders reached Constantinople, and in the days of Gratian and Theodosius, not in those of Godfrey and Tancred. From the same authority, Ducange, I find that Evagrius (fl. 536) many years later, indeed almost a couple of centuries after the date ordinarily assigned to Palladius, still recognises alAovpos as the more correct denomination for the Felis clomesiicus, saying, as though the word KOLTTa were a somewhat trivial and over-familiar designation, alkovpov rjv Kdrrav fj avvd^Ca Aeyet, lib. vi. 24. The word ' bird' stood once, I believe, in mudi the same relation to the word 'fowl:' and the householders of this country show often a greater precision and correctness, more prisca fides in short in this matter of the use of these two words, than the upper Ten Thousand do. I have had a reference given me to a work of the period of Eustathius, i.e. about iioo a.d., viz, the FaAeco/xvo/iaxta of Theo- dorus Prodromus, in which the word yo.\r\ may be found ^ and proved to be used for the cat as we understand the word. I have not however been able to discover or borrow any reference to the employment of the wori yaKr\ in the sense of Felis or in any other * The following are a few lines from this work, taken from an edition printed at Basle, 1518, by Frobenius, without numbering to the lines. They are, I think, conclusive:— A. Tis \ariv avrrj ; firj (pOovqarjs rov Kiyttv. B.

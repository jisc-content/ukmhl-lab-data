XXX. ON THE DOMESTIC PIG OF PEEHISTOEIC TIMES IN BPJTAIN, AND ON THE MUTUAL RELATIONS OF THIS VAEIETY OF PIG AND ' SUS SCROFA FERUS,' 'SUS CRISTATUS,' ' SUS ANDAMANENSIS/ AND 'SUS BARBATUS.' Portions of two skeletons of domestic pig-s having been put into my hands by the Rev. Wilh'am Greenwell, F.S.A., from an interment of the so-called late Celtic period, i.e. of the ultimate or penultimate century before the Roman conquest of this country, I determined to compare them with such other specimens of Suidae as might by any possibility be genetically connected with them. Among these other specimens I may mention, first, several speci- mens of the wild boar, Sus scrofa, var. ferus, from the alluvial deposits of this neighbourhood, and now in the Geological Series of the Oxford Museum, under the charge of Professor Prestwich, F.R.S.; secondly, five specimens of the Indian wild hog, Sus cristaius, kindly lent me by Sir Walter Elliot, K.C.S.I., F.L.S.; thirdly, two skulls of Sus andmnaneiisis, presented to the Oxford University Museum by my friend Prof. J. Wood-Mason, of the Indian Museum, Calcutta ; and fourthly, four skulls of Sas harhatiis from Borneo. The extensive series of skulls of Suidae contained in the British Museum, those in the Royal College of Surgeons of London, and the specimens of wild- and domestic-swine skulls con- tained in our own collection were also used for this comparison. It may be well at the outset to specify the several points of wide and general interest upon which such an enquiry as the ensuing may be brought to bear. First among these I would mention its bearings upon the now so commonly discussed questions relating to the early migrations of our own species. The pig was one of the

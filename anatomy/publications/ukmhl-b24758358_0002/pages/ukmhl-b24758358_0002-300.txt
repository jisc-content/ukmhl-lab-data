786 MODIFICATIONS OF ASPECTS OF ORGANIC NATURE But when tlie invention of gunpowder and the application of it to the science and art of projectiles ' put me a caliver into Wart's hands,' the principal raison d'etre of the yew-tree was destroyed. A man who drew a good bow, even if he drew it at a venture, had needs have ' the limbs, the thews, the stature, bulk, and big assemblage' of the men who won the battles of Agincourt, of' Cressy red and fell Poitiers;' and if he were to put his arrows into the clout, he had needs have a steady and well co-ordinated eye, in addition to well co-ordinated and strong arms, to be eflPective. Such men were sent on many a campaign from England; and for the commencement of such campaigns, before the hardships of war had impaired the soldier's condition, no more efficient man-slaying machines could, when fair stock was taken of the relative deadli- ness of the available weapons, have been conceived of, till the rifled musket was discovered. But even English archers were liable to the influence of short rations, hard work, and weather; and as campaigns were not always settled in a few weeks, the firelock— a weapon which Feeble and Wart, even if they were not their 'craft's masters,' could, under the supervision of that admirably qualified musketry instructor ' Master Corporate' Bardolph, learn in a few weeks to use with as much effect as the most stalwart of tournament champions—displaced the bow and arrow, though not entirely till after the wars of the Roses. This displacement seems to have entailed the disappearance from many and many a locality of lines and avenues of yew-trees, of which here and there we still have a few representatives left us, and which, in such places as the combes in chalk districts, form in the way of contrast, and indeed also intrinsically, such a pleasant and interesting feature of the landscape ^. Of the vastness of the change which the introduction of the common elm [Ulmus cam/pestrls) into Britain has produced in the landscape, any one who will count and compute the numbers of the trees visible in any one of our midland counties at one view * Having above quoted Mr. Hasted to his disadvantage, I wish to make some compensation to his memory by here quoting a sentence of his with which I entirely agree, but which T had not read when I wrote as I have done in the text, relatively to the yew. It is the concluding sentence of the already quoted paper in the ' Philo- sophical Transactions ' of 1771, and runs thus : 'Whoever has been much acquainted with the woods and tracts of ground lying on our chalky hills will surely never contend that the yew is not the indigenous growth of this country.'

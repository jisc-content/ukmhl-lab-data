APPENDIX. NOTES ON THE SITE OP ROMAN POTTERY WORKS AT THE MYNCHERY UPON THE SEWAGE FARM, NEAR OXFORD. In the year 1879, in the course of trenching and levelling operations at the Myncheiy or site of the nunnery near Littlemore, Oxford, under- taken by the Local Board in connection with the formation of a Sewage Faim, the engineers employed by the Local Board exposed in the farm-yard a number of human skeletons with some mediaeval stone coffins. The bodies found undisturbed were aU lying with the head to the west and the feet to the east, and in the graves numerous pavement tiles were found similar to those of Plantagenet times exposed in making excavations in All Souls Chapel. The skeletons were of both sexes and of different ages, and may have been the bodies of persons who had died in a poor-house attached to the priory of the Benedictine nuns, dissolved by Heniy the Eighth, which formerly stood on this spot. As in many of the fields a considerable quantity of broken Roman pottery was also found, both on the surface and buried to the depth of one and two feet, it was considered desirable that the ground should be carefully examined in order to see if evidence could be obtained that the pottery had been manufactured in the locality. Permission having been given to Dr. RoUeston by the Local Board to continue the excavations, Mr. Edgar S. Cobbold, who took great interest in the discovery, gave very material assistance, and in the course of time four kilns (one a double one in a good state of preservation) in which the pottery had been made, together with a well and pieces of the burnt clay on which the pots were placed for the process of baking, were exposed. In the rubbish heaps adjoining the kilns some moulds were found, and burnt clay retaining the marks of the workmen's fingers. As a rule the pottery was much broken, but a few perfect pieces and others almost perfect were found, and of these some were contained in the well. The pots or shards consisted of jare.

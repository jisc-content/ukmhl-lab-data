CEMETERY AT FRILFORD. 647 viii. Pottery of very many patterns and degrees of fineness, from very fair and fine Samian down to very coarse ware. Some of both bestudded interiorly with particles of sUex; some with pattern very like that of the Anglo-Saxon urn. See Bruce, 'Roman Wall,' p. 438 ; A. Corbet's ' Uriconium,' p, 63. September 25, 1868. ix'. Anglo-Saxon girl, with two plain bronze fibulae, in a grave from 18 in. to 24 in. deep, lying over Romano-British woman (xvii' of Sept. 26, infra p. 648). The skeleton's upper half ran from W.N.W. to E.S.E.; but the lower half of the body was twisted at an obtuse angle to the upper half, and lay from N.N.E. to S. S. E. This distortion probably accounts for the displacement of one of the fibulae from the right shoulders on to the manubrium sterni. Towards the lower end of this grave a beautiful coin was found, Byzantine, 4th century. Decentius. Many bones brought of a child of 9 aet. For the view that men had only one fibula and women two, see L'Abb^ Cochet, ' Tombeau de Childeric,' 6d. 2''®. 1859, p. 228. Can this distorted position correspond to the ' contraction from the hips' described by Canon Greenwell, at Kirby-under-Dale, Times, 1841 ? x''. Skeleton of a child, 12 to 14 months, from a grave running from W.N.W. head to E.S.E. foot. The depth of skeleton was 23 in. xi'. Skeleton of child, 6 to 7, found lying immediately above xii* in a grave with bearings W. for head, E. for feet. There was a large stone at its head, and in the grave were three pieces of Roman pottery, one beautifully patterned, and a horse's tooth. First true molar just coming into place. Could this child have been a Christian Anglo-Saxon ? xii*. Skeleton of adult male, probably 25 to 30 aet., lying underneath preceding skeleton, head at W.N.W., feet at E.S.E. Femur, 19-2 in.; humerus, 13-7 in. Globose Romano-British type. Stature, 5 ft. 10 in. September 26, 1868. siii"^. Skeleton of adult woman. Femur, 16 in.; stature, 5 ft. In a grave running from W.N.W. by N.W. to E.S.E. by S.E., its depth being 35 in. to stone which was under the back of her head. The vertex of the head was horizontal, the frontal norma looking E.S.E. and the vertebrae of the neck being underneath the base of the skull. The head of the humerus was 2 in. from the skull. No relics nor traces of naiLs in this grave. Possibly a coffinless one. Elongated type. A number of shards were with this skeleton, but I think it may have been an Anglo-Saxon woman, such as No x of March 17, 1868. xiv'. Skeleton of young man. Femur, 17.6 in.; stature, 5 ft. 4-4 in. The skull lay on its right side, in a grave running from W.N.W. to E.S.E. of 36 in. deep, without pottery or nails. Elongated British type. xv^ Skeleton of old man. Femur, 17.19 in.; stature, 5 ft. 7-6 in. From a grave running from W.N.W. to E.S.E. 32 in. to top of skull, which was lying on its right side, not raised. The lower jaw a little on one side, not, however, so much as the head. A stone 9 in. long, 5 in. across, and 3§ thick, was so close to the forehead as to render it difficult to think a coffin could have been present. Elongated British type. Very fine skull, nearly of same size as the largest skull of the Dinnington series- See 'Journal of Anatomy and Physiology,'vol. iii. p. 253, 1&68, also Article xiii, p. 160. Skeleton of old man. Femur, 16-3 in.; stature, 5 ft. in. From grave of same direction and depth as others; no nails, but some fragments of pottery and 'marks of burnings.' Elongated British type.

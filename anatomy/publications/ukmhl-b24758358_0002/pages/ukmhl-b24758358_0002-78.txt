Left lower third molar of Sus andamanensis, female, i| times the natural size. This tooth shows the three divisions of the third molar of the true Suidae in great simplicity. There are two bicuspidate lobes corresponding to the two principal lobes of molar i and molar 2, and, like them, enclosing a single azygos lobe in the middle line between them. This azygos lobe is developed from the second bicuspidate lobe. There is no ridge developed in Sus andamanensis on the anterior part of the tooth, i. e. on the face in contact with molar 2. Posteriorly to two bicuspidate lobes, which already show signs of wear, are seen five smaller cusps, occupying in all a much smaller space than the rest of the tooth. In the males of Sus cridatus these five smaller cusps would, as in well-fed domestic pigs, occupy a very much larger space relatively and absolutely than they do here, or even in Sus scrofa, var. ferus. In Sus harbatus the third lower molars are as simple as they are in Sus andamanensis, and, like this Sus, have the tlurd molars of the upper jaw simpler still than the lower. The five posterior cusps consist of one placed mesially in the interspace between the primary cusps of the second pair, of three placed like the dots in the sign •. •, and of a fifth, not constant, accessory cusp placed on the inner side. The four latter are represented in the upper jaw of this pig by two, and in Sus barbatus by one main cusp.

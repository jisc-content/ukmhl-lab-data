EXCAVATIONS IN AN ANCIENT 646 vi. Skull luith a few hroken long hones of old woman, very like a modem Swiss skull, 768 B, in Oxford Museum, with a cephalic index of 82. The oblique dip away of the posterior half of the parietal makes its distinctive character from the Anglo-Saxon xiii of May, 1867, and the skull xiv of Jan. 16, 1868. It is shorter and broader than the River-bed type, but its longitudinal arc has the same contour. Again, No. vi of 1867, with cephalic index 79, resembles it very much, and by vi of May, 1867, we pass to vi of Sept. 17, 1867, with cephalic index 78, and to the female skull or calvaria xi of April i, 1868, xiii of Jan. 15, 1868. vii. A child's shull, removed by the men. First dentition only. viii. Young woman 25 <o 30, sJcull and long bones, found near child with two amber beads. Skull of Romano-British, elongated, coronally-constricted type. See ' Crania Britannica,' Plate LVIII. Wisdom-teeth not through the gum, though the crista is anchylosed to the ilium. ix. Skull of woman 25 to 30, found with a coin which is lost, and in last grave but one on right side, whence came the child with the two amber beads. Osteophytes on inner surface of skuU. Femur, 16.5 in.; tibia, 13-6 in.; stature, 5 ft. 2 in. X. Fragments of slcull of old person, probably female. No history; found in 'fall' with fragments of Roman pottery; skull of platycephalic type with the posteiior sagittal ' rainure,' supposed to characterize Celts and Scandinavians. See ' Bull. Soc. Anthrop. de Paris,' 1863, p. 319; 1864, p. 283. Internally, in correspond- ence with this, is a very deep furrow for the longitudinal sinus; showing of course that the bottom of the two furrows outside and inside the skull corresponds to a line of arrested growth, and that the skuU has grown out on either side in lines of the parietal tubera, to fit itself to the growing brain. In other skulls, as for example skull No. ii of March 23, 1868, this parietal vallecula on the exterior corresponds with raised ridge along the line of the longitudinal sinus. See 'Jour, of Anatomy and Phys.' iii. 253, 1868, also Article xiii, p. 159. xi. SJcull and long bones of old ^voman ? from extreme right of quarry; of globose Romano-British type, resembling skull No. vi of Sept. 1867, and vi of April i, 1868, and vi of April, 1867. Femur, 14-5 in.; stature, 4 ft. 6 in. xii. Child with first set of teethâ€”removed by me. Romano-British direction of grave. 2 old men, 2 adults 9 i, i young man, i boy 12, 3 children, 4 old women, 2 young women, = 15 bodies. September 24, 1868. The excavations on this day were carried on upon two patches of ground which Mr. Aid- worth had observed to have stronger and greener corn growing upon them than was to be seen elsewhere. Great quantities of the bones of the domestic animals, exclusive of the horse but including the dog, were found, to- gether with the articles specified and numbered. No human remains were observed however. These spots appear to have been the rubbish- pits of some house of a person of considerable wealth, an 'eques.' See Pearson, 'History of England,' i. 45 ; and Coote, ' Neglected Fact in English History,' pp. 40-45, cit. in loco, vii. Coin. One of the many coins imitated from Roman originals in 5th and 6th centuries. Very common in England. ^ i. Key of Roman type .... ii. Stag's-hom hair pin .... iii. Bronze ring iv. Two knives V.

844 MODIFICATIONS OF ASPECTS OF ORGANIC NATURE those which our present Poet-Laureate enumerates in epexegesis of the ' march of mind;' there we have the line, ' In the steamship, in the railway, in the thoughts that shake mankind,' â€” ponderables and imponderables severally holding their due mutual proportion. And from this line I can pass in this place by a natural and locally suggested transition to what I believe to be as large a difference between the ancient and modern world as either of the two last touched upon. The whole of the old world, of the orbis veterihus notus, of Tiaaa rj oLKovfxevq, was but a small fragment as measured by the geographer when compared with the world dealt with by our emigration agents and Custom-house officers. The discoveiy of America has been said to have exercised much the sort of influence upon the old world, socially and politically, that the approximation to our globe of some new planet would exercise astronomically; and since those 'spacious times of great Elizabeth' China, Japan, Australia, and Polynesia have each entered into the circle of influences acting upon and acted on by the world as known to the classical writers. In speating of any district beyond those in relation with the valleys of the Euphrates, the Danube, the Rhine, the Rhone, and the shores of the Mediterranean and Black Sea, the ancients would but say in really pathetic antithesis : ' Longa procul longis via dividit invia terris.' The Brindisi mail brings every manager of a museum, as well as every secretary for the colonies, into weekly relation with ' regions Caesar never knew,' by agencies of which he never dreamt and of which in our own times the greatest perhaps of his successors, fortunately for us, as he is reported to have remarked in Plymouth Sound, never learnt to avail himself.

Before this application had established high- ways on the ocean and invented machinery which, 'Spuming sails and scorning oars, Keeps faith with time on distant shores,'

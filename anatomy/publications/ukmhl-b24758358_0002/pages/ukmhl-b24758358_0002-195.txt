XXXVIIL ON THE CHAEACTER AND INFLUENCE OF THE ANGLO-SAXON CONQUEST OF ENGLAND, AS ILLUSTEATED BY AECHAEOLOGICAL EESEAECH. There are numerous points of general and living interest relating to the Anglo-Saxon conquest of this country which are very largely dependent upon archaeological research for their elucida- tion. Amongst these may he mentioned the question of the extent to which the Romano-British population previously in occupation was extirpated; the question of the relative position, in the scale of civilisation, held by victors and vanquished ; and the question of the extent of our indebtedness as to language and laws to one or other of the two nationalities. Light is thrown, even upon points apparently of the most purely archaeological character, from such literary sources as histories of the nomenclature of localities, as the records of monasteries^ as illustrations in manuscripts, and as laws. But the graves of the Anglo-Saxons and their contents have been for the present investigator the primary, and such literary works as those alluded to, and such as many of those published under the direction of the Master of the Rolls and by the Early English Text Society, have been only a secondary source of in- formation. They have, however, been by no means neglected by him. It may be well to begin by stating how an Anglo-Saxon is to be distinguished from a Romano-British interment. Anglo-Saxons, during the period of their heathendom, which may be spoken of roughly as corresponding in England to a period of some 200 or 300 years onwards from their first invasion of the country iu force, were interred in the way of cremation, and in urns of the pattern

FURTHER RESEARCHES IN AN 656 view, which is based upon the recognition of an acknowledged tendency of the human mind as opposed to a view which can only appeal to a superstition of probably much more limited geographical range ^. A somewhat similar vessel, both as to size and contour, from the Oberpfalz of Bavaria, may be found figured in ' Die Samm- lungen des Germanischen Museums,' Niirnberg, 1868, p. 67. May 23, 1870, iii; May 23, 1870, vii.—Skeleton of old Romano- Briton lying in a grave such as described in 'Archaologia,' xlii. p. 422, undisturbed 18 inches below skeleton of a young Anglo- Saxon, set. about 17, with umbo, spear, and knife. May 23, 1870, iv b; May 23, 1870, iv a.— Skeleton of old Romano-Briton, buried with coffin, lying from 4 ft. 7 in. below skeleton of old Anglo-Saxon woman, lying in the contracted position without any relics, and, indeed, with disproof of any coffin, with two cruciform fibulae, a shroud-pin, an iron ring, and a knife ^. In both cases the long axis of the upper grave formed more or less of a right angle with the long axis of the semi-oriented lower one. Tliis shows that the burials could scarcely have been simultaneous: for the other conclusions which can be based upon the finding of two skeletons, verifiable as Saxon and Romano- British respectively in the relation specified, see my previous ^ For the general literature, see Cochet, 'Arch. C(^r.' p. 14, ibique citata; ' Nor- niandie Souterraine,' pp. 199, 267; 'La Seine Inf(5rieure,' p. 530; 'Tombeau de Childeric,'p. 391,ibique citata; Akerman, 'Eesearches at Long Wittenham,'Archae- ologia, xxxviii. pp. 342, 346, 352 (note), 330, 333, 342, 352 ; pi. XX. fig. 2 ; 'Pagan Saxondom,' pi. XXII, where an urn 8 in. high is described as containing tweezers, shears, comb, and knife, though it is not stated whether any bones were found in it or not. See also ' Inventorium Sepulohrale,' 1856, Introd. p. xxvi, and Neville's 'Saxon Obsequies,' p. 9, where vessels like these are said to have been very frequently, as regards the entire number (viz. three or four times out of twelve), found with infant skeletons, and to have been found either at head or foot,' though in the grave of an adult two small vases were found, one on each side of the former.' This difference in placing seems to me to favour my view as above stated. The Selzen vases were, it is true, or nearly always, at the feet, and those found in the French interments of the same period, always, according to Cochet, 1. c. But at Hallstatt (see V. Sacken, ' Das Grabfeld von Hallstatt,' 1868, p. 107) the position of these vases was most variable: ' bald standen sie zur rechten, bald zur liiiken Seite des Skelettes, neben dem Kopfe, bei dem Hiiften oder zu den Fiissen, bei Verbrennungen in der Kegel neben den Brandresten, selten auf denselben.' * These four skeletons, with the relics accompanying them, were presented to the Cornell University, Ithaca, United States. A more detailed account of these objects than that given above may be found in the ' Kegister' of that University for 1S70- 1871, pp. 50-54.

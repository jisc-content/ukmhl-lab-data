707 MEDICINE IN MODERN TIMES. entails as to the penning-iu of its various acrid and volatile and other secretions, oedema and vascular congestion are to be observed in the skin, as well as in other organs (Ranke, ' Physiologie,' p. 456). The flame of mammalian life, like the flame of inorganic combustion of carburetted hydrogen, can only be sustained at a high temperature; a certain reduction is as fatal to the one as it is to the other in the Davy lamp, and the vitality of the more exposed peripheral is more easily depressed than that of the more protected central nerve-system. I should be paying but a poor compliment to the judgment which has provided a microscopic exhibition for the instruction and entertainment of this evening, if I were to dwell at any length upon the relations borne by Histology to Medicine and Surgery, And, secondly, if I were to dwell in the least adequately upon the importance of a knowledge of Microscopic Zoology to the diagnosis, and what is better than the diagnosis, and even than the thera- peutics, the prophylaxis of diseases of all kinds, from those which are considered trifling or contemptible by most men, except those who suffer from them, up to those which excite world-wide anxieties, such as trichiniasis or cholera, I should have to extend my address to a length you would shudder to think of. Upon one single point I will make a few remarks; and the purport of these will be to show how the manipulation of such an instrument as a catheter may find, if we are to do justice to our patients, its regulative condition in the manipulation and revelations of the microscope. I had myself recently come to suspect that the determining con- dition of the triple phosphatic alkalescence of the urine was to be looked for and found in the presence of some of those organisms which Pasteur has proved and hygienists have believed to be the real causative agents of fermentations and putrefactions. One accepted view of the causation of this most mischievous metamor- phosis is, that the coats of the bladder, in consequence of altered innervation, as after spinal injuries, act upon the urine as so much dead matter acts on blood in causing its coagulation, or as the tissues round about the capillaries act when they are in an abnormal condition upon the rows of blood-corpuscles within those canals; and by this 'catalytic' agency break up the urea and throw down the ammoniaco-magnesian phosphates. Another view ascribes the like effect to the 'fermentative' working of the abundant catarrhal

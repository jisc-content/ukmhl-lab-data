BIOLOGICAL TRAININQ AND STUDIES. 852 scientific instruction as an engine for training the mind; but neither, on the other hand, should I wish to depreciate the value of literary culture, my view of the relations of these two gymnastics of the mind being- the very simple, obvious, and natural one that they should be harmoniously combined — Alterius sic Altera poscit opem reB, et conjurat amice. I know it may be said that there are difficulties in the way, and especially practical difficulties; but I have always observed that people who are good at finding out difficulties, and especially practical difficulties, are like people who are good at finding out excuses,—good at finding out very little else. The various ways of getting over these difficulties are obvious enough, and have been hinted at or fully expressed by several writers of greater or less authority on many occasions. It is, however, of some consequence that I should here say what I believe has not been said before, namely, that a purely and exclusively literary education, imperfect and one-sided as it is, is still a better thing than a system of scientific instruction (to abuse the use of the word for a moment) in which there should be no courses of practical familiarising with natural objects, verification, and experimentation. A purely literary training, say, in dialectics, or what we are pleased to call logic, to take a flagrant and glaring instance first, does confer certain lower advantages upon the person who goes through it without any discipline in the practical investigation of actual problems. By going through such a training attentively, a man with a good memory and a little freedom from over-scrupulousness, can convert his mind into an arsenal of quips, quirks, retorts, and epigrams, out of which he can, at his own pleasure, discharge a mitmille of chopped straw and chaff-like arguments, against which no man of ordinary fairness of mind can, for the moment, make head. It is true that such sophists gain this dexterity at the cost of losing, in every case, the power of fairly and fully appreciating or investi- gating truth, of losing in many cases the faculty of sustaining and maintaining serious attention to any subject, and of losing in some cases even the power of writing. A well-known character in an age happily, though only recently, gone by, who may be taken as a Caesar worthy of such Antonies, used to speak of a pen as his torpedo. Still they have their reward, they succeed now and then

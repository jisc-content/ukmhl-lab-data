PBODUCED BY MAN. 841 Saturnalia; and in a very short time the entire race of sheep, ex- cept in a few mountain districts, would have been as wastefully slaughtered for their blood and fat as flocks and herds have been and still are slaug-htered by us in Australia or South America. Oxen would hold out a little longer than sheep, and pigs, I incline to think, longer than either. But that a great diminution of the sum total of brute enjoyment, and, if such a thing there be, of brute happiness also, would take place after we had disappeared, I think needs no demonstration, especially to anybody who, without any experience of any canine mutiny, has ever studied the phenomena of a dog-show or listened at night to the opera which its denizens perform. The various races which, without exactly being do- mesticated, stand yet on the borderland separating wild from domesticated life, would also very shortly and very sharply have brought home to them the fact of their being more dependent on man than perhaps either they or we have entirely recognised. Eabbits and hares, pheasants and partridges, if they had reason, would reasonably regret the times when they viewed, with some- thing perhaps of disgust, the slouching form of the gamekeeper with his double-barrelled shot-gun perambulating the ridings in the woods and skirting their sunny boundaries. Cats and weasels would with little less delay than the dogs make the life of quad- rupeds just specified as miserable as that of the sheep and ox had already been made; and would, after the lapse of a year or two, with the aid of hawks and corvidae of several kinds, greatly thin their numbers. The river embankments on the lower Thames, lastly, which excited the admiration of Sir Christopher Wren, and were referred by him to the time of the Romans, and also those on many other rivers, having no one to repair any of the breaches which floods would make in them, would before very long allow a very large acreage of land to become swamp, marsh, and lagune ; not only thus, on the one hand, depriving many species of animals of their means of subsistence, but also on the other introducing pre- datory birds, such as gulls, and accelerating the disappearance of many others which really hold their own in such neighbourhoods even now only by man's protection and thanks to his presence. The purview of this prophecy extends no further than the pre- cincts of the British Islands; in continental countries organic nature would more completely resort to the condition it was in

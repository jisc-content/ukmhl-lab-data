664 ON THE THREE PERIODS KNOWN AS enough to find a Saxon burial with iron and bronze both in the superficial layers of such barrows, but the superficial position of such burials shows tlieir posteriority in point of date. The central interment at the bottom of the barrow on or sunk into the natural soil, may or may not contain a bronze dagger, may or may not contain weapons of flint, survivals from, and relig-ious or ceremonial reminiscences of, the Stone Ag-e, may or may not contain vessels of pottery, may contain a skeleton in the contracted position, or burnt bones either in an urn, or in a case of bark, or simply naked in the earth (I have seen all these cases); but it has never contained any shred of iron within my experience, nor, as I believe, within that of any person who can be trusted to distinguish between a primary and a secondary interment. It will be said by some in answer to this that iron is oxidizable and perishable in an eminent degree, and that it would disappear whilst the bronze would remain. This suggestion I will not characterize as one of the study as opposed to one of the barrow, but as one of the laboratory, and the laboratory with its strong reagents supports it in a way that the slow and weak or wholly inert chemistry of the deep sand, or rubble, or gravel-filled grave does- not. Of course, if you conceive a stream of water, acidulated even slightly with nitric acid, to pass constantly over an iron spear-head, there is no difficulty in estimating the time which will be necessary for the entire disappearance of an implement so tested. But no such agent is available in many, I might say most, Bronze Period graves. In some such graves you may find the objects they contain encrusted with a deposit of carbonate of lime, which would have protected an iron weapon of the Bronze Period if there had been any to protect; or jon may find, as I am happy often to have seen, the bones in a capital state of preservation, and contrasting to great advantage with the corroded and ' perished' bones of Saxons whose iron weapons were, nevertheless, very present with them ; or the grave itself may contain a considerable quantity of free carbonic acid, as other sunk wells do, and yet may be so dry from conditions of superjacent and subjacent rubble and soil as to have afforded no means for the removal of any results of any slight erosion which its contents might have suffered. The phenomena disclosed by the spade must be compared with those disclosed by the test tube; there is here a makro- as well as a rar^^-o-chemistry.

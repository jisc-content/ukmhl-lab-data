MEDICINE IN MODERN TIMES. 699 I will now proceed to give, in the second place, an account of a physiological experiment worked out for us, from time to time, in the laboratory of Nature, which throws not a little light on a question which, I learn from Dr. Wilson Fox's work on ' Dyspepsia ' (p. 141), is still a matter of debate among pathologists—the ques- tion, to wit, ' of the influence of perverted innervation in causing inflammatory, or sometimes even still severer morbid changes^.' It is well known that stags, after injury to the testes, have correspond- 'ing changes wrought out in the corresponding horns. Such a specimen I can show you from the Christ Church Museum, founded by Dr. Matthew Lee. In a curious old work dedicated to him, in company with two others of the King's Physicians, by Dr. Richard Russell^, and styled 'The Economy of Nature in Acute fragmentary condition, from a barrow, is to the same skull when pieced together and reconstructed, as you may see many such skulls in the Museum, by Mr. Robertson. ^ The following references to authorities on this vexed question I herewith ap- pend :— Lister, 'Philosophical Transactions,' 1858, p. 627.

' It may be interesting to record here, in passing, that Dr. Richard Russell lived at Reading, that he was a friend of Dr. Chapman and of Dr. Frewen of this very place, and that the copy of his work to which I have referred, and which exists in the Christ Church Scientific Library attached to the Christ Church Museum, and deposited with it in the University Museum Buildings, did in 1760, eleven years before Dr. Russell's death, belong to Dr. Chapman. Now these facts and dates render it not improbable that this very specimen may have been given by Dr. Russell to Dr. Chapman, possibly together with this copy of his book. It is unfortunate that so much should be left to speculation; but this digression may be justified by the moral which it conveys, to the effect that we are bound, when receiving a specimen into a museum, to put on record forthwith, for the benefit of our successors, a note of its history and donor.

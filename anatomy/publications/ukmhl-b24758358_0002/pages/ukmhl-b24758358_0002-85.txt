XXXIII. NOTE ON THE GEOaRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF LIMAX AGRESTIS, ARION EORTENSIS, AND FASCI OLA HEP A TIC A. That some not inconsiderable confusion exists as to the question of the existence of Arion ater and Limax agrestis in Greenland, will be seen from the following quotation, to be found as hereinafter specified (-A Manual of the Natural History, Geology, and Physics of Greenland, together with Instructions for the use of the.

On referring, however, to the Prodromus itself, as published in Danish in 1857, I find the entry wbich concerns us stands simply thus:— 'Mollusca OrSnlandica: Order i. Geophila. Gen. i. JAmax, L. *i.

Probably introduced'—is altogether something fresh and new; whilst the asterisk, denoting that the

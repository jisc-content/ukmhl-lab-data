XXXII. ON THE ROT IN SHEEP. The English Lake District presents us with as simple a case for the investigation of the cause of rot in sheep as any other portion of the wide area over which that disease has spread, with, perhaps, the exception of such isolated localities as the Faroe Islands: for sheep abound upon its thousand hills, while the species of snails and slugs are but few, and the conditions of its geological form- ation, of its fauna and of its flora differ as widely from those of many other regions within our four seas similarly affected as it is, all things considered, possible for them to differ. Having occasion to visit the district in question last week, I used the opportunity for making a few enquiries of the farmers and shepherds there as to the natural history of this plague. These enquiries were of the simplest kind, anybody can repeat them, and I cannot but think that the answers he will receive will incline such an enquirer to think that a strong a priori case is made out in favour of the view put forward in ' The Times ' of April 7, to the effect of identifying the black slug {^Arion ater) or the gray slug [Limax agrestis) as one necessary link in the chain of causes concerned. I found the natives as intelligent and observant as I have found them to be any time during the last thirty-four years upon natural history questions ; and I very rapidly got the following facts deposed to by them without any prompting on my part:â€” I. The fluke disease is a disease of low grounds, and notably of pastures liable to be flooded. 3. But not exclusively of pastures liable to be flooded; for, what is of special consequence as going some way towards eliminating the pond snails {Limnaeus pereger) and others from the charge of sharing in the causation of fluke disease, the pasturing of sheep in a stubble rich in the ' melancholic poisonous green,' which a wet

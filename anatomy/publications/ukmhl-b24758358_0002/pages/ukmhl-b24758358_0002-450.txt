936 TYPHOID OR ENTERIC FEVER IN INDIAN GAOLS. Thirdly: I think Dr. Parkes's name must be added to those of the ' very few dissentients,' who will thus, without counting the Calcutta magistracy, come^ to number seventeen, as against the seven gentlemen named by Dr. Buchanan. For in the third edition of Dr. Parkes's 'Practical Hygiene,' which bears date April, 1869, I find the following words, which do not appear in the edition of 1864:— ' There is one evident objection to all these dry plans—namely, that the excreta are retained about our houses for some time. No doubt when mixed with earth they are inodorous, and it is presumed harmless, but of this no evidence has been given. What would be the result of cholera or typhoid discharges received in earth and allowed to remain in the house ?' I have upon other occasions pointed out times and places in which a dry-earth system of conservancy may have claims upon our favourable consideration: those times, I have always held, are not times of epidemics; those places do not lie within the enceinle of large towns. In several of the Reports which I have consulted I have found more or less favourable mention made of the system ; these passages I have not thought it my business to quote, for reasons which may be readily imagined. I propose at a future opportunity to offer a further communication on this subject, in which, I trust, the readers of ' The Lancet' will find something of greater interest than they can, I fear, have found in this inter- minable array of authorities. The immoderate length to which my paper has reached may be justified, I hope, upon the principle that a man who goes a little out of his own proper line, as I suppose I do by meddling with hygiene, ought to be doubly sure of his ground. I trust I have shown that I have not been wanting in this abundans cautela.

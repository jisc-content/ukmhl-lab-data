ADDRESS ON ANTHTIOPOLOGY. 903 most distinctly ponderable, and in every sense the largest, Anthro- polog-ical publication ot the day. Archaeology, which but a short time back was studied in a way which admirably qualified its devotees for being called ' con- noisseurs,' but which scarcely qualified them for being called men of Science, Jias by its alliance with Natural History and its adop- tion of Natural History methods, and its availing itself of the light afforded by the great Natural History principles just alluded to, entered on a new career. There is, as regards Natural History, Anatomy, and Pathology, nothing left to be desired for the con- joint scheme represented by the periodical just mentioned, where we have V. Baer for the first and Virchow for the last, and the other names specified for the rest of these subjects; whilst Ar- chaeology, the other party in the alliance, is very adequately re- presented by Lindenschmit alone. But when I recollect that Prichard published a work ' On the Eastern Origin of the Celtic Nations' ten years before the volume of ' B-esearches,' from which I have just quoted, and that this work has been spoken of as the work ' which has made the greatest advance in Comparative Philology during the present century,' I cannot but feel that the 'Redaction' of the 'Archiv fiir Anthropologic' have not as yet learnt all that may be learnt from the Bristol Ethnologist; and they would do well to add to the very strong staff represented on their titlepage the name of some one, or the names of more than one, comparative philologist. This the Berlin 'Zeitsehrift fiir Ethnologic' has done. Of the possible curative application of some of the leading prin- ciples of modern Anthropology to some of the prevalent errors of the day, I should be glad to be allowed to say a few words. The most impoi-tant lesson as regards the future (I do not say the im- mediate future) which the modern study of Human Progress (for such all men who think, except the Duke of Argyll, are now agreed is the study of Anthropology) teaches is the folly and impossibility of attempting to break abruptly with the past. This principle is now enforced with persistent iteration from many Anthropological platforms; and I cannot but think it might advantageously be substituted in certain portfolios for the older maxim, ' Whatever is certainly new is certainly false,' a maxim which seems at first sight somewhat like it, but which, as being based on pure ignorance

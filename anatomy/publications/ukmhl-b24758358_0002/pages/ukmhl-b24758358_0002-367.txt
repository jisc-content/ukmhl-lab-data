BIOLOGICAL TEAINING AND STUDIES. 853 in convincing juries, and they are formidable at dinner-tables. It would not be fair, however, not to say that a purely literary train- ing- can do much better things than this. By a purely classical education a man, from being forced into seeing and feeling that other men could look upon the world, moral, social, and physical, with other (even if not with larger) eyes than ours, attains a cer- tain flexibility of mind which enables him to enter into the thoughts of other and living men; and this is a very desirable attainment. And, finally, though I should be sorry to hold with a French writer that the style makes the man, the benefit of being early familiarised with writings which the peculiar social condition of the classical times, so well pointed out by De Tocqueville (' De la Democratic en Am^rique,^ i. 15), conspired and contributed not a little to make models of style, is not to be despised. Such a familiarity may not confer the power of imitating or rivalling such compositions, but it may confer the power of appreciating their excellences, the one power appearing to us to be analogous to the power of the experimenter, and the other to that of the pure ob- server in Natural Science; and we should undervalue neither. Masters of Science, it must be confessed, are not always masters of style; let not the single instance of last night tempt you to generalise, it is but a single instance, the writings of the man whom we in this section are most of us likely to look upon as our master in Science have been spoken of by our President in his recently published volume as 'intellectual pemmican^;' and if scientific reading and teaching is to be divorced from scientific ob- servation of natural objects and processes, it is better that a man, young or old, should have in his memory something which is per- fect of its kind, entire and unmutilated, such as the opening sentences of the ' Brutus' of Cicero, which Tacitus, I think, must have had in his memory when he wrote his obituary of Agricola, or as the opening sentences of the ' Republic ' of Plato, or the conclu- sion of the ' Ajax' of Sophocles, than that he should have his memory laden with a consignment of scientific phrases which, ex hT/pothesi, have for him no vital reality. I have already said that I am strongly of opinion that literary should always be combined with scientific instruction in a perfect educational course; these ■ [Professor Huxley was President of the British Association at the meeting at which this Address was delivered.—Editok.]

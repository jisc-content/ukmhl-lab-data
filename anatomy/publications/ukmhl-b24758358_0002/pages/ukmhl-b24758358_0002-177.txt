663 TJIE IRON, THE BRONZEj AND THE STONE AGES. was discovered. Still, this would not prove that bronze must, as has been maintained, have, as being- a more complex invention, been a later discovery than that particular modification of iron known as steel. The rig-id resistent bronze would make a better weapon, especially for that most efficient process of sword-play, 'giving- point/ the thrusting' punciim, as opposed to mere slashing- caesim, of the Roman military writers, than would such soft iron as in the absence of the knowledg-e of converting- iron into steel could only have been available to the savages who reduced it. A pike may ' bend bravely,' even when made of good steel, and a Jbrliori, as the quotation from Polybius shows, when made only of uu- tempered iron. When, however, once the art of making steel out of iron was discovered, and soft iron took on 'the ice-brook's temper/ the wider diffusion of the material, and the greater facilities of this process of manufacturing an equally useful article out of it, caused the displacement of bronze just as many a similar discovery has caused the displacement of many another product of toilsome elaboration by the introduction of another and simpler one. It should not, however, be forgotten that ' cementation ' is a preliminary process to that of hardening and tempering in the manufacture of steel, that it is a process requiring several days as well as the combination of several other conditions if it is to be successful, and that the improbability of pre-historic men stumbling- early and easily into the knowledge of a process consisting of a considerable number of heterogeneous operations is, in spite of the now apparent simplicity of those operations, as great, perhaps, as the improbability of their.similarly stumbling into the discovery of bronze. Coming in the second place to the Bronze Age, and facing the discussions hereinafter to be bibliographised, I have to say that, as against all quotations from old and modern authors, and as against all records, by whomsoever recorded, of the discovery of iron weapons in Bronze Age Tumuli, I am as confident as I can be of anything in Anthropology that no iron will be, though bronze not rarely is, found in Tumuli of the Bronze Period and Round Shape in this country at least. 1 have been present and assisted in more ways than one at the examination of many 'Round,'' Bell,' 'Bowl,' 'Cone' shaped Barrows, and in the primaiy interment in such Barrows I have never seen any other metal than bronze.

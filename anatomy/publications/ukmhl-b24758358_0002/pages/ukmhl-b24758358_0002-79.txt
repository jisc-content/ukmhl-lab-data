XXXI. NEW POINTS IN THE ZOOLOGY OF NEW GUINEA. The author commenced by saying that the zoology of New Guinea has had a great deal of research bestowed upon it, and will yet have a great deal more^ as a consequence of the profit which has already resulted. A point which recent zoological discoveries in New Guinea throw light upon is that there was a dry land passage at one time between Australia and New Guinea, recent discoveries in the latter country having revealed the presence there of animals similar to, or identical with, some found in Australia. This is held as proof that where Torres Strait now is there was once dry land. But against this hypothesis is urged the diflFerence between the vegetation of the two islands. This, however, is accounted for by what Herbert Spencer calls the circumambient medium. Though people are inclined to think vegetables consider- ably less sensitive than animals, sometimes they are more sensitive to heat and dryness; and the author believes that it is the greater tenderness of the vegetation in those countries which accounts for the disparity observable between the vegetable growths of New Guinea and those of Australia. In the centre of New Guinea there is a high range of mountains, which attract and impart moisture to the surrounding country; while the interior of Australia consists of great barren plains, which harbour no moisture. The plants, as they have not had the means to protect themselves available to animals, have gradually altered their form to accommodate them- selves to circumstances. A curious creature, covered with prickles, living on ants and other insects, and unprovided with means of militant operations, is found on both sides of the Straits. Two kinds of Txhidna have also been discovered in New Guinea, and

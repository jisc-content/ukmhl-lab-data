ON THE THREE TERIODS KNOWN AS 662 barbarian came up ferox virihus, brandishing' his broadsword, its downward strokes were parried, and the malleable iron, glancing downwards, beat as malleable iron will do, and left its gigantic owner at the mercy of an Italian, some five feet six inches in stature, who then brought into this sword-play a weapon which he had been taught to use punct'm, non caesim. The same tactics succeeded at Culloden, as the tactic of thrusting and giving point always will succeed when masses of men in rows, not isolated individuals merely, are pitted against each other on the thrusting versus the slashing plan, though the slashing sword at Culloden was of good steel enough. The point for our present purpose in this story of the victory of Flaminius over the Insubrian Gauls lies in the proof it gives us of the existence, so lately in the world's history as B.C. 224, of a warrior-race fighting with soft iron instead of steel swords. The red kidney iron ore, which we know so well from the fact of such large fortunes having been made out of it in the country lying north of Ulverston, and that other hematite known as ' hematite brun,' ' Brauneisenerz,' ' Sumpferz,' and the specular iron ore of Elba and Norway, are widely ' distributed,' very rich in their percentage of iron, and allow of its being easily (even if wastefully, as we should consider it) extracted. In the metallic state, iron is seldom met with naturally; as the ' Dictionary of Chemistry,' suh voc, p. 335, tells us, telluric iron is very rare ; and meteoric iron, the other variety of native metallic iron, now that the common Greek name for iron is known not to have any relation to any sidereal origin, but to express simply the dew-like out- sweating of the metal as reduced in the primitive ' bloomeries' of those early Dactyli, Elfins, and Dwarfs, whom we know as ' Tubal Cains,' ' Vulcans,' ' Sindris,' and ' Wayland Smiths,' has lost any claim which it may have been supposed to have had to being considered the primitive source of iron weapons. Hence it is of the utmost consequence to keep in mind the fact that certain widely diffused ores of iron are very easy of reduction, as the exami^les furnished by the metallurgy of certain African negroes, and of wild tribes in India and in Borneo, abundantly prove. And it is possible enough that in pre-historic times one of the more easily reduced ores of iron may have been reduced, and even found to be malleable, before not only bronze but even the mode of reducing a copper ore

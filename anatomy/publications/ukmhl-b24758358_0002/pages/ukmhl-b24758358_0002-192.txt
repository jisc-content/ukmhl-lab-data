THE IKON, THE BEONZE, AND THE STONE AGES. 678 belonged to a woman of about thirty years of age, or a little over. The suture between the first and second vertebrae of the sacrum is widely, but not symmetrically open, and its patency with a greater width on the left than on the right side must be con- sidered as due to some morbid process. All the sutures and epi- physes of the limbs are closed and anchylosed ; so also are, to a great extent, the sagittal and lambdoid sutures in the skull. The characters of the facial bones, such as those of the elevation of the nasal bones, and the proportions indicated by the measurements, show that this E-omano-British lady may have deserved the praise of Martial as expressed in the following lines :— 'Claudia caeruleis quam sit Kufina Britannis Edita, quam Latiae pectora plebis habet! Quale decus formae Romanam credere matres Italides possunt.' BIBLIOGRAPHY OF THE BRONZE CONTROVERSY. Crawfurd, John, 'Supposed Stone, Bronze, and Iron Ages,' Trans. Ethn. Soc., N.S., iv. 1-13. 1866.

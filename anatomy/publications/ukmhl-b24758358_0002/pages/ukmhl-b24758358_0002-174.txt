XXXVI. ON THE THEEE PEEIODS KNOWN AS THE IRON, THE BRONZE, AND THE STONE AGES. I HOPE that in the observations I am about to submit I shall make plain the differences which have enabled antiquaries to divide pre-historic times into two principal divisions, namely, the Stone and the Bronze ages—and to draw a tolerably sharp line of demarcation between these periods—and the Iron ag-e, in which we are now living-, and to which the interment examined this day in Oakley Park belonged. It has been said very truly that ' Les divisions des etres, des objets, des sciences sont la source la plus commune des erreurs de I'esprit humain ;' and naturalists regard the aphorism ' Nature is not so strict a classifier as man' as being one of their common- places. And I do not say that no one of the three ages has been overlapped at either end by another, nor can I accept all the minute subdivisions of these periods which some specialists have urged upon us. But gradations at both ends of any series should not prevent us from seeing, acknowledging, and holding, that it may be distinct enough in its middle; and if old forms of imple- ments and weapons are enabled by isolation as regards locality to live into contemporaneity with newer ones, that is only what happens with older forms of animal and vegetable life which isolation of the same kind often preserve as living fossils, but without for a moment making us doubt the propriety of referring them to an ago distinct from ours. Let us begin with the Iron Age, with the age of which we know most, and so work our way gradually upwards and backwards through the Bronze into the Stone periods. The drawings I ex- hibit represent the implements and weapons used by the Romans

ON THE CAT OF THE ANCIEN^T GREEKS. 517 But I am inclined, as I think Bocbart was also, to consider these lines to be so worthy of their author as to be unworthy of any attention from us. And it is interesting to note that, in a Basle edition, of the year 1546, of Tzetzes' works, the first, and to the credit of human nature it should be added, also, up to 1826, the last independent edition of this portion of his works, some of which happily still remain unprinted, there stands opposite these lines the following Latin note : 'Alii mustelam rusticam seu viveri'am.' 3. If I understated my case in this instance, I overstated it in another, when I said (p. 513) that the cat will never take to burrows in the way of refuge. I have already said, in this paper, that in drawing up catalogues and making faunae, it is wise and well to avoid universal negatives. It would have been well if I had had this precept before my eyes in a more generalised form when I wrote my last paper; for I have since been informed by two good ob- servers that they have each of them known a cat take to trog- lodjtism. In neither of these cases, however, did the animal profit much by doing what it could not have been expected to do.

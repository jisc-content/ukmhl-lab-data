704 PHYSIOLOGY IN RELATION TO a justification in Professor Beale's demonstration in 1865 of the ending- of the muscular nerves in nucleate reticular plexuses. Assuredly, the discovery of these net-works bearing- nuclei does away with the necessity for any further carrying- on of the appa- rently interminable discussions as to the existence of an ' idio- muscular' as opposed to a ' neuro-muscular' contractility. But I will take this opportunity of saying-, that there are not wanting purely physiological considerations, which, though not by any means amounting to demonstration, do nevertheless lend some little probability to the ' neuro-muscular' explanation of those movements which take place in muscles separated from all con- nection with central nerve-organs. Firstly, these movements are, within my experience, more marked and frequent in the muscular tissues of young animals; and the history of the development of nerves would lead us to expect to find a greater degree of inde- pendence in the peripheral nerve-system, than we should look for in the adult organism; for nerves do not grow from cells in the direction of what we know in the adult state and under low powers of the microscope as their branches; but, as Von Hensen has shown (Quain's ' Elements of Anatomy,' 7th edit. p. clxiv), two nerve-cells are connected by a fibre, and it is by the withdrawal of the one cell from the other, and the elongation, so to say, of the interconnecting fibre, that the peripheral and central ganglionic systems respectively assume their adult relations. And just so, I may add, in certain annelids and lamellibranchiata, we have, as we not rarely do have in the lower animals, a stereotyped though but partial adumbration of what is but a single scene in the moving diorama of the develop- ment of the higher; and we find the peripheral nerve-system studded with eyes or other sensory organs, and possessed of a prominence and importance relatively to the central nerve-ganglia which is only temporarily seen in the development of more perfect creatures. Secondly, many of the cases of death in adults, in which this irritability is found to exist most commonly and markedly, are cases in which, from very various reasons, the functions of the intracranial nerve-centres are put into abeyance at a very early stage in the process death ward. Such are (see Nysten, cited by Brown-Sequard, 'Proceedings of Royal Society,' 1862, p. 211) cases of decapitation, of asphyxia, and of sudden haemorrhage from

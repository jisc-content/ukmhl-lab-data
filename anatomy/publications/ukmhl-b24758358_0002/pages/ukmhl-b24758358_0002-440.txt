THE EAETH-CL08ET SYSTEM. 926 Crimea. Thirdly, these experiments show very plainly how seriously wetting impairs the power which earth and ashes have of retaining gases in their pores; and this, which the rationale of their operation, as ordinarily taught, would have led us to anticipate, has been practically confirmed by Dr. Mouat's actual experience of the working of earth-closets in India. (See ' Report on Gaols of Lower Provinces,' p. 144, 1868.) Now 'slops,' or fluid refuse of all kinds, must be got rid of somehow and some way; and either they are thrown upon the earth or ash ' con- servancy,' where it exists, and, producing the physico-chemical solecism to which I have alluded, they reproduce the horrid Man- chester 'middens' (q.v., or, by preference, Mr. George Greaves's account of them in the ' Quarterly Journal of Science'), or they have a system of sewers to receive them, along which the solid matters, little if indeed at all less noxious than they, might just as well pass too. Fourthly, the double journey, in and out of town, which earth must go through, is a great drawback upon the merits which it may possess; whilst the fact that coals do come into our towns as it is may tempt us to advocate the employment of the ashes they are converted into for the purposes in question. In the house of the rich man, where the bodies producing refuse are not very greatly out of proportion, or, possibly enough, only equal in number to the fires producing ashes, and where a separate system for liquid refuse is but a trifling item in the expense of house- building, an ash ' conservancy' is a possibility. But the quantita- tive considerations, to which I have just alluded, show a priori that it is as inapplicable in theory to the needs of a poor population as, I believe, actual trial of it on the large scale has shown, and always will show, it to be in fact.

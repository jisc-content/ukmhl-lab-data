JADE TOOLS IN SWITZEELAND. C89 Lubbock, writing, as I am, in haste for an afternoon post. But if the sheep and goat were known at all in the Stone Age—and every collection of Swiss-lake antiquities shows they were—my argument stands. Let me say in conclusion that archaeologists in England will be srlad to have a notification of the various kinds of animals which were found in such abundance in the Bienne Lake pile-dwelling at SchaflBs. In that station—one of the oldest in the Stone Age— both jadeite and nephrite implements were found; but whether sheep and goat bones were found in company with them I cannot quite positively say. Of course, it has been put on record that the two sets of objects were so found in the Stone-Age pile-dwellings of Mooseedorfi", Locras, and Wanwyl. y y

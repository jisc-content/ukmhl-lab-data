811 PKODUCED BY MAN. whatever distance, the great Pallas, they insist upon the strength of the claims of that portion of Central Asia whence issue the great rivers Ganges and Indus, Tigris and Euphrates, and which they speak of as ' den grossen Buckel Asiens,' to be considered as the primitive home of man, mainly as it was, according to them, the original home of all our domestic animals and so many of our cultivated food-plants. These writers and discoverers slightly overstated their case when they said that all our domestic animals could be referred to parent stocks indigenous to that region, though, as will be shortly shown hereafter, it would have been little beyond the truth if, instead of saying all the domestic animals absolutely, they had said all the domestic animals wMcli are absolutely indispensable to modern man^s comfort and progress. But their case for their particular thesis would have been greatly strengthened if they had known that jade in the form of stone implements had accompanied man together with the goat into Western Europe, and was found no nearer to the Swiss Lake Dwellings than are the Kuenlun mines pointed out on my map; if they had known that copper and tin could have been smelted together into bronze so readily either in Khorassan or in Burmah; if, to put however injudiciously my weakest point last, they had also known that amber—such a frequent accompaniment of prehistoric man—also lay within easy reach of his curious hands in this latter country. But prehistoric arehfeology has till lately made but little advance since the time of Lucretius. De Candolle {'Hist, des Sciences et des Savants,' p. 263, 1873), indeed, classes it as a discovery a,s new and as great as five others of the twenty or thirty years previous to 1873, viz., spectrum analysis, convertibility of force, the greater extent of glaciers in geological times, natural selection, and the alternation of (animal) generations; and the \\ riters referred to knew not, and could not have known, the whole strength of their position. As regards my present purpose it is, in these but little later days, superfluous to point out how the discovery of mines whence prehistoric man must, or at least might, have furnished himself with his weapons, implements, and orna- ments, actually upon or along the same mountain ranges, spurs, and valleys, in which he must, or at least might, have found in a wild state the animals which he has now around him as necessary and universal elements in his own social life, bears upon the

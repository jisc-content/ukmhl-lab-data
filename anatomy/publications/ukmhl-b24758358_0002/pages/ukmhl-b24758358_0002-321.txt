807 PRODUCED BY MAN. largely some quarters of the globe have been benefited by borrow- ing from others, or in the language of my subject, how largely they have been modified by man's interference. The first of these maps is very closely similar to the one which shows on Mereator's projection the now more or less generally ac- cepted zoogeographical regions of the earth's surface, the Palaearctic, to wit, the Ethiopian, the Oriental, the Australian, and the two regions of the New World, the Nearctic and the Neotropical; as given by Dr. Sclater, and in Wallace's great work on Geographical Distribution. The second of these maps is an enlargement of that given by Professor Huxley in the ' Journal of the Ethnological Society of London,' June 7th, 1870, to illustrate and embody his views on the distribution of the principal modifications of mankind. This map serves, besides other useful purposes, that of limiting off, by a distinct colouration, a particular portion of the vast Palaearctic region which is specially important to the subject in hand, as it was either actually upon it, or upon regions closely adjacent to it within that region, that the parent stocks of the moiety of our cultivated plants and domesticated animals may either be found still living or may reasonably be supposed to have existed formerly. The particular subdivision of the Palaearctie Region has been coloured in a particular way by Professor Huxley, so as to indicate that upon it his ' Melanochroic' or dark-white variety of our species was living not in perfect purity of stock, but more or less peacefully intermingled with the Mongoloid and with his ' Xanthochroic' or fair-white varieties. The area thus peopled occupies itself on the map a district something of the shape of a tuning-fork, the two arms of which would form the northern and southern boundaries of the Mediterranean eastward from the longi- tudes of Albania and Tripoli; and would be carried by a broad base extending from the Caucasus over Syria and a part of north-west Arabia to the Red Sea, whilst its stem would cover Kurdistan, Khorassan, and North Persia, and end by bifurcating at a spot near Peshawur. The importance of this area is illustrated by the fact that a region very closely corresponding, if not quite coincident with it, is marked out upon quite different principles in the next map. A coincidence of much less intricacy, and therefore of much less cogency, though still not without a certain curious significance, is

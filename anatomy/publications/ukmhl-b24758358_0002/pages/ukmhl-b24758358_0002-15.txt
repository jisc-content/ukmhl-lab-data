DOMESTIC CATS. 505 the larger-mustelines when tame or at least in captivity composes itself to sleep, and the very evident reluctance with which it unrolls itself, when awaked, out of the dog-like convolution into which it has curled itself up, will feel the force of the naore correct render- ing. Some of the Alexandrians, again, who were contemporary with Theocritus, used the same word for the tame cats (with which they were more familiar than he, a mere occasional visitor in Egypt, could have been) that Herodotus uses. Callimachus, in his ' Hymn to CereSj' has, line iii, KOI Tciv at\ovpov rav (Tpefie Orjp'ia ixMKa, where the Scholiast in loco gives Karros as the synonym. On the other hand^ the compiler of the collection of foolish stories (which is ascribed falsely to Aristotle, and called tbe 'De Mira- bilibus Auscultationibus ')j who is supposed to have lived about the same time as Callimachus and Theocritus, speaks, as does ^lian after him, N. A. 15. 26, section 38, of a kind of Cyrenian mouse as being nXarvirpocTcoiTos uxnrep al yaXoL; and it is difBcult to think that yaXai ' is not intended to stand in this passage for Feles. Section 28 however may have been introduced into this treatise in later times, or possibly the words Zairep al yaXal may by themselves have found their way there as a gloss from the pen of some wise Byzantine to whom in a later age, when the yaXij of tbe classic times had resigned both office and name to the alKovpos from Egypt, curaefidt ejusmodi quisqidUas co7iscribere. The Batrachomyomachia, it should be observed^ is quite free from any taint of Alexandrian or Byzantine impurity, and the use of the word yaA?/ by writers from these localities does not bear therefore upon its employment in the verses above quoted from it. But though there is no reason for supposing that the Felis domesticus was domesticated in any other country than Egypt before the Christian era, there are many reasons for demurring to the statement ordinarily ^ made to the effect that this animal was first spread throughout Europe at the end of the period of the Crusades. On looking into Ducange's Glossarium, under the words ' Catta' and ' Cattinae Pelles,' I find that Caesarius, who was the physician-brother of Gregory, the theologian of Nazianzus, and who died a.d. 369, having been the friend of the second Constantine and Constantius, speaks of hbpvixoi ' For example, ' Conversations-Lexicon,' BJ. viii. p. 735 ; Bahr, Hdt. ii. 66.

604 POMESTIC CATS. from an e^rly period, as we know from Herodotus and also from the Book of Baruch^; and Cuvier^ could not discover any specific difference between the mummied remains of the domesticated Felis of those days and the similar structures in our own pet cats. Varro (fl. B.C. 28) and Columella (ft. a.d. 20) both speak of the Felis as Appian (fl. a.d. 190) does of the cuXovpoi KaKoepyoC as animals to be kept out of poultry-rpens, but none of these writers speak of the animal as being domesticated ; and Cicero when he speaks, or hints, more suo, that he would speak but for a reluctance to be tedious, de felium tdilitate^ speaks in the same connexion of the ichneumon and the crocodile, and shows us thereby that he had Egypt and not Italy in his eye. The two lines in the Batrachomyomachia, 51-52, TtXiiarov yaKtrjv irepihtihia ^ris dpicrTT), ;. 9} Kal TpcoyKoSvovTa KaroL Tpwy\r]v iptelvfi, do not seem to compel us to translate ya\er]v by felem, as Kara tp(J^y\r}v may very well mean '■along and throtiglmit my hole^ and indeed the line 4 lyGiaTt] yaXtrj rpi;y\i]s tKroaOiv iKovaa may seem to show that the catching outside was a rare occurrence, and the inside or musteline method the commoner ^. Neither do I think that certain others of my predecessors have been more correct in translating the words in the fifteenth Idyll of Theocritus, the Adoniazusae, line 28, al yoKtai /xaXauZs xp^fSorrt KaOevStv, as though the domestic cat was alluded to by Praxinoe. For though our proverb speaks of the catching of a weasel asleep as a matter of some difficulty, anybody who has watched the way in which one of * ' Epistle of Jeremy, Book of Baruch' (Apocrypha), chap. vi. verse 22. ^ ' Annales du Museum,' An. xi.

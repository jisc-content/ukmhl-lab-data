854 BIOLOGICAL TRAINING AND STUDIES. somewhat lengthy remarks refer therefore only to systems in which it is proposed that we should have not only a bifurcation but a radical separation of studies and students; and the moral of this may be summed up by saying that a purely scientific education must be a thoroughly practical one, familiarising the student with actual things as well as with words and symbols. It was upon the solid ground that Antaeus learnt the art of wrestling ; it was only when he allowed himself to be lifted from it that he was strangled by Hercules. Coming now to the second part of my address, I beg to say that the word Biology is at present used in two senses, one wider, the other more restricted. In this latter sense the word becomes equivalent to the older, and till recently more currently used word ' Physiology.' It is in the wider sense that the word is used when we speak of this as being the Section of Biology: and this wider sense is a very wide one, for it comprehends, first, Animal and Vegetable Physiology and Anatomy; secondly, Ethnology and Anthropology; and thirdly, Scientific Zoology and Classificatory Botany, inclusively of the Distribution of Species. It may have been possible in former times for a single individual of great powers of assimilation to keep himself abreast of, and on a level with, the advance of knowledge along all these various lines of investigation; but in those times knowledge was not, and could not, owing to difficulties of intercommunication, the dearness of books, the costli- ness or non-existence of instruments, have been increased at the rate at which it is now being, year by year, increased ; and the entire mass of actually existing and acquired knowledge was of course much smaller, though man's power of mastering it was no smaller than at present. It would now be an indication of very great ignorance if anybody should pretend that his own stock of information could furnish him with something in each one of the several departments of knowledge I have just mentioned, which should be worthy of being laid before such an assembly as this. As will have been expected, I shall not presume to do more than glance at the vegetable kingdom, large as is the space in the landscape of life which it makes. What I propose to do is merely to draw your attention to a very few of the topics of leading interest, which are at the present moment being, or rather will shortly begin to be, discussed by experts in the Department of Physiology and

918 RELATIVE VALUE OF CLASSICAL AND SCIENTIFIC TRAINING. natural science, with the drawing and modelling so indispensable to it. Von Pettenkofer deprecates the making of any material increase in the number of hours to be spent in the Gymnasien, on the un- deniable ground that the day is no longer and man no stronger now than were the days and the men of aooo years ago; and the space for such additamenta as must be made to the curriculum must be found by bettering the methods and means for communicating instruction, and elfecting thus an economy of time. The Bavarian chemist and hygienist does not himself suggest any ways and means whereby this economy may be effected, and presumptuous though it be, we will attempt to supplement this deficiency by saying that such an economy might be effected in England and English schools by applying one or other, or all three, of the following lines of treatment to the classical curriculum, even with- out cutting its Greek adrift. Latin and Greek, to put the boldest suggestion first, might be studied in certain, and those not a few, cases, as literatures and not as philologies; or, as a second alterna- tive, when some training in philology is to be retained at whatever cost, such training might be made more intelligible, and so less dis- tasteful and wasteful of time, by making the study of it comparative, as recommended by Professor Max Miiller in his evidence before the Commission just referred to; or thirdly, synthetical scholarship, in the way of verse-making, should be considered as a luxury and refinement to be reserved for the delectation and cultivation of those few who, in any age, show any aptitude for it, and synthetical scholarship in the way even of writing Latin prose might, due precautions having been taken, be dispensed with in the cases of youths who, whilst wholly incapable in that, had shown some capacity in some other line. Our ' due precautions ' should consist in the multiplying the practice of synthetical scholarship in the way of translation from Latin into English. We know the horror which these suggestions will excite in the breasts of schoolmasters of the type represented by the gentleman who told the Com- missioners already referred to, that if he were set to teach history in set lessons, he ' should not know how to do it.' But we believe that by the adoption of any one of the three lines of action just glanced at, space and time might be found for the introduction of the natural sciences into the curriculum of any public school, and that at once without injury to the dignity of either the one or the

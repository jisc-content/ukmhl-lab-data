23 OF THE BRAIN. Part IV.] called by Ruysch, Tomentum Cerebri,—which run into the Substance of the Brain ; as may be readily seen, upon separating the Circumvolutions a little from each other. Between the Hemispheres, a white Substance is ob- served, called Corpus Callosum, from its being a little firmer than the rest of the Brain. It goes across the Brain, under the Falx, and is merely a continuation of the Medullary Substance, running horizontally, and joining the two sides of the Hemispheres to each other. In the middle of the Corpus Callosum there is a lon- gitudinal Raphe with a Medullary Cord on each side, from which many Transverse Streaks issue. These Cords, like the Corpus Callosum itself, become gradual- ly broader towards the Posterior Extremity. An horizontal Section, a little above the middle height of the Brain, or upon a level with the Corpus Callosum, shews the division of the Substance of the Brain into outer and inner, or Coiiical and Medullary parts. The outer Substance is termed Cineritioiis, from its being of a greyish or ash colour,—though a little tinged with brown ;—and Cortical, from its surrounding the in- ner part of the Brain, as the Bark does the inner parts of a Tree. It is termed by some Authors Glandular, and by others Secretoiy, from a supposition that a Fluid was secreted in it. The Cinentious Substance covers the Brain in general, and enters deep between its Convolutions, is of a soft consistence, and composed of numerous small Vessels, B 4 carrying

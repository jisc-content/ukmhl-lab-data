Part IV.] OF THE EYE. 69 the Foramen Opticum, between the Levator and Ad- ductor Oculi. From thence it runs directly forwards, sends off a long round Tendon, which passes through a Cartilaginous Pulley fixed behind the Internal Angu- lar Process of the Os Frontis, and is here inclosed in a Bursa Mucosa. From this it goes a little downwards, and returns backwards and outwards, passing under the Levator Oculi. Insertion : By a broad thin Tendon, into the Tunica Sclerotica, about half-way between the insertion of the Levator Oculi and entrance of the Optic Nerve. Action: To roll the Ball of the Eye, by turning the Pupil downwards and outwards. Obliquus Inferior, Vel Obliquus Minor. Origin: By a narrow beginning, from the anterior edge of the Orbitar Process of the Superior Maxillary Bone, near the Lacrymal Groove, from which it passes obliquely outwards, backwards, and upwards, round the Ball of the Eye. Insertion : By a broad thin Tendon, into the Sclero- tic Coat, between the entrance of the Optic Nerve and insertion of the Abductor Oculi, and opposite to the insertion of the Obliquus Superior. Action : To roll the Ball of the Eye, by turning the Pupil upwards and inwards, and, with the assistance of the Obliquus Superior, to pull the Eye forwards j there- by becoming an Antagonist to the Recti. The two oblique Muscles, on account of rolling the E 3 Eye,

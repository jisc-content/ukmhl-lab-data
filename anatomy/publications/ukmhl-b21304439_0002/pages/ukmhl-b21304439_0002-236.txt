OF THE VISCERA, See. [Part IV. 228 Posterior Plane, by a longitudinal Groove or Fissure, where the Vessels and Nerves enter. The Anterior Plane is more concave than the Poste- rior, corresponding to the contiguous convexity of the Stomach. The Spleen has frequently deep Fissures upon its edges ;—sometimes it lias small Appendages attached to it, and not unfrequently there is one or more Small. Spleens connected with it. At the inner side, it is fixed to the Omentum, and by means of that and Blood-vessels, to the Stomach and Pancreas.—Behind, it is connected to the Diaphragm, and below, to the Left Kidney and Colon, by Reflec- tions of the Peritoneum, and by Cellular Substance. It is covered by a double Membrane, one Layer of which is a production of the Peritoneum, the other pro- per to the Spleen itself, but so closely connected to the common Coat, that they appear to be one and the same Membrane. The substance of the Spleen is remarkably soft, and it is by much the most tender of the Abdominal Viscera. It consists of a Congeries of Blood-vessels, Lympha- tics, and Nerves, joined together and supported by a large quantity of Cellular Substance. The extreme Branches of the Blood-vessels put on the appearance of Penicilli, which hnve been mistaken for Glands. These Vessels are so tender, that when an Injection is forcibly thrown into either Artery or Vein, particularly the latter, it bursts into the common Cellular Substance, and gives the appearance of Follicles or Cells.

Part IV.] OF THE THORAX. The i pressed and closely connected} and have a flee commu— nication with each other. Between the different Lobes, Lobules, and Cells, a large quantity of common Cellular Substance, destitute of Fat, is interposed, which unites and strengthens them, and allows the Blood-vessels to be minutely dis- persed over them. The Cells of the Lungs have no communication with this common Cellular Substance; for when Air is blown into it, the Lobules are compressed ; but when the Air is blown in through a Branch of the Trachea, the Cells are again distended, and the Lobules recover their for- mer dimensions. In the Foetus, the Cells are empty and in a collapsed state;—but as soon as Respiration begins, they become distended, and continue so during life, and in every state of Respiration, and even in the recently dead Body:— But if an Opening be made into the Cavity of the Tho- rax, whether in the living or dead Body, and the Air in this or in any other way freely admitted, they imme- diately collapse by their weight and elasticity, the pres- sure of the Air being then the same on the outer Sur- face of the Lungs, and inner Surface of the Trachea. The Lungs are covered by Two Coats, an External or Common, and an Internal or Proper one. The External or Common Coat is a continuation or reflection of the Pleura, is extremely thin, but dense, and, like the other warts of the Pleura, is found to pos- Lungs, but does not enter between their different Lo- bules. It forms a general covering to the O O

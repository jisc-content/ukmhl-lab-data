OF THE VISCERA, &c. [Part IV. lbiO peels, there is a Projection seen in the Sinus Venosus, called Tuberculum Lovveri, which is supposed to pre- vent the Blood of the one Cava from rushing upon that ot the other, and to direct it into the Auricle. At the meeting of the two Cavae in the Human Heart, an Angle is formed, which also has frequently got the name of Tuberculum Loweri.â€”This Term, however, is peculiar to the Projection in the Hearts of Brute Ani- mals. Under this Angle or joining of the Venae Cavae, there is the Vestige of the Foramen Ovale, which, in the Foe- tus, forms a communication between the Right and Left Auricles, but in the Adult, is filled up by its Mem- brane, and forms the Fossa Ovalis. The Fossa Ovalis has thick and strong sides, called Columnar Foraminis Ovalis, Isthmus Vieussenii, vel An- nulus Fossae Ovalis. At the left side of the Mouth of the Inferior Cava, s' where it joins the Sinus, is the Valve of Eustachius. It is in form of a Crescent, with the convex edge fix- ed to the union of the Sinus and Cava, and the concave edge turned obliquely upwards, reaching about half way over the Mouth of the Cava. Its size and appearance, however, vary much in different Subjects. Its posterior Cornu is continued with the left side of the Isthmus of the Foramen Ovale; the other end va- nishes in the opposite side of the Sinus. It is equally distinct in the Adult as in the Foetus ; but in the former it is frequently found reticulated, or Cribriform, which appearance is seldom, though some- times, met with in the latter. In

225 Part IV.] OF THE ABDOMEN. urinate in the Cava, where that Vein iies behind the Liver. The Venae Ilepaticae receive the Blood from the He- patic Artery and Vena Portae, after the Bile has been, secreted, and return it to the Vena Cava, to be convey- ed by it to the Heart. The Vessels of the Liver communicate with each other in such a manner, that, alter Death, a good In- jection may be made to pass from the Artery into the Vena Portae, Venae Hepaticae, and Biliary Ducts, though into these last with difficulty. The Lymphatics of the Liver are so numerous as to cover almost the whole of its outer Surface. They dis- charge their contents partly into the beginning of the Thoracic Duct, and partly into a Plexus situated be- hind the Sternum. The Nerves of the Liver are also numerous. They , arise from the Great Sympathetics and Eighth Pair, and accompany the Blood-vessels. The Biliary 1 nets arise by extremely minute Branches, 1 termed Pori Biliarii, or Tubuli Bilijiri, chiefly from the t extremities of the Vena Portae, in the Substance of the 'Corpuscles, through the whole ol the Liver. The Pori Biliarii run in company with the branches of I the Artery and Veins, and unite into larger and larger Branches, which aiteryvardsgo into two, and these again iinto a single Trunk in the. feinus Portarum, called Due- :(us Hepulicus. The Ductus Hepaticus serves to carry the Gall or Bile, which is of a yellow green colour, from the Liver,—and • to convey it, by the power ot the Pleart, Hepatic Artery, and

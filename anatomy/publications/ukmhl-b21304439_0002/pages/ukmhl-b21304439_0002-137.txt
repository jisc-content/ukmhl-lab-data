125 Part IV.] OF THE MOUTH, &c. form a Layer of Bone, which extends over the Surface of the Pulp to the Necks of the Teeth. Between the eighth and ninth Month, Ossification is considerably advanced in all the Pulps, and, In the full grown Foetus, the outer Shells of five Teeth in each side of each Jaw are found, which are termed Temporary, Deciduous, Shedding, or Milk Teeth. Of these there are in each side two Incisores, one Cuspidatus, and two Molares; besides, there is the Shell of the Anterior Permanent Molaris ; but the whole of the Temporary Teeth are much smaller than the corre- sponding classes of Teeth in the Adult. In the Upper Jaw, the points or eminences of the Shells correspond with the depressions in the Teeth of the Under Jaw. After the outer Shell of a Tooth is formed, the Os- seous Matter gradually penetrates the greater part of the Pulp, and, having completed the Body, it contracts, and forms the Cervix of the Tooth. Having formed the Cervix, the Cavity of the Tooth is by degrees diminished, and in proportion as it is les- sened, part of the Pulp is pushed out or elongated, and assumes the part of the respective Fang. Upon this Pulp also Bone is deposited. While the Fang is extending, the Socket is found to accommodate itself to it, by extending along with it till the Fang is completed. Where there are two or more Fangs, the Osseous Fibres shoot across at the Cervix, and form the begin- ning of these, after which the Ossification of each Fang advances

Part IV.] ORGANS OF GENERATION. 287 curved Vesicle floating in the Limpid Liquor of the Ovum. In the fourth Week, the Ovum is about the size of a Pigeon’s Egg, and the Embryo not larger than that of a common Fly. At the end of the sixth Week, the Embryo is about the size of the common or Honey-Bee, with the I lead turned t forwards, towards the farther extremity of the Trunk. The size of the Head is almost equal to that of the rest of the Body. The Eyes and Mouth appear evident. In the eighth Week the Ovum is about the size of a Hen’s Egg, and the Embryo is about an inch in length. The Nose and Ears now begin to be visible; the Limbs extend beyond the Trunk. The Cord is at this period nearly as long as the Embryo, but the Ves- sels run parallel to each other, nor do they receive their twisted appearance till a few weeks afterwards. About the end of the third Month, the Ovum is of the size of a Goose’s Egg, and weighs eight ounces, while the Embryo is between two and three ounces in weight, and three inches in length; and the Head and Extre- mities being now distinctly observable, it obtains the name of Foetus, which it retains from this time till the end of Gestation. Towards the end of the fourth Month, the motions of the Child begin to be felt by the Mother, in conse- quence of which, the term Quickening has been applied. In the sixth Month, the Placenta and Membranes weigh seven or eight ounces, the Foetus twelve or thir- teen. It is then eight or nine inches in length, and perfect in all its external parts. In

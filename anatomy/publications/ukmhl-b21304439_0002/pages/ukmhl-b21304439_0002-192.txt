This Gland has a Granulous appearance within, and a Viscid Liquor is sometimes observed in it, which has been supposed by Sabatier and some others, to lubri- cate the parts in the neighbourhood. It is supplied with large Blood-vessels, and with seve- ral Nerves, from the Superior and Inferior Vessels and Nerves of the Larynx. It is likewise furnished with numerous Lymphatics.—But no Excretory Duct has yet been observed to come from it; nor is its office yet understood. The Tracheal Glands are small, but numerous, and of different sizes, surrounding the Muscular Coat of the Trachea, and its Branches in the Lungs;—the largest of them are placed in the Fleshy Substance behind. From each of these Glands, a small Duct issues, and throws out a Mucus, to defend the inner Surface of the Trachea from being injured by the Air, or by the ex- traneous Particles which it carries along with it. The Bronchial Glands are placed in the Cellular Sub- stance round the under end of the Trachea and roots of the Bronchi, where these penetrate into the Substance of the Lungs. They are of various sizes, from that of the point of the Little Finger to that of a Millet-seed, and have a bluish or blackish colour, corresponding in a great measure with the colour of the darkest parts of the Lungs.

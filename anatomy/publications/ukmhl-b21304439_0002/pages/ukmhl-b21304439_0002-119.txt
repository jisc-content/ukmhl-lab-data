Part IV.] OF THE MOUTH, &c. 107 of the Fifth Pair, and also from the Portio Dura of the Seventh Pair. The Palate is divided into the Palatum Durum and Palatum Molle. The former is composed of the Palate- Plates of the Upper Jaw, and is covered by the Perios- teum and common Membrane of the Mouth, which prevent the Bones from being injured. The Membrane which covers the Bones of the Palate forms numerous Kitgce, which assist in the division of the Food. It is nearly of the same structure with that of the Gums, but perforated by the Ducts of the Palatine Glands, for the excretion of Mucus, which serves to lu- bricate the Palate, and assists in dissolving the Food. The Palatum Molle, Velum Pendulum Palati, or Soft Palate, is that part which depends from the posterior edge of the Ossa Palati, and from the Pterygoid Pro- cesses of the Sphenoid Bone, and forms a Musculo- Membranous Partition between the Nose and Mouth. It is composed of the Membranes which line the Nose and Mouth, and of the Expansions of the Circumflexus and Levator Palati, and likewise of numerous Mucous Glands, which serve to lubricate the Mouth and Throat, and facilitate Deglutition. 1 he Palatum Molle conducts the Fluids of the Nose into the Mouth, and acts like a \ alve in preventing what we swallow from passing into the Nose. In the middle of the Posterior edge of the Velum Pa- lati, the Uvula or Pap of the Throat takes its origin, and hangs pendulous from the Velum over the root of the Tongue. It

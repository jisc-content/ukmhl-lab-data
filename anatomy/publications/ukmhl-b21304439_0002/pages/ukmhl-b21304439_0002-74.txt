62 OF TIIE VISCERA, &c. [Part IV. becomes gradually firmer and tougher towards the centre, where it forms a Nucleus. The Lens is surrounded by a very pellucid proper Capsule, called Tunica Aranea, or Crjstallina, which is much thicker and more clastic than the Capsule of the Vitreous Humour, but adheres so slightly, and is so easily lacerated, that after a small puncture is made iti it, the Lens starts out, upon applying gentle pressure to the Capsule. The posterior part of the Capsule is much thinner, softer, and weaker, than the anterior ; but is quite a distinct Membrane from the Tunica Vitrea ; yet so firmly connected to it by Cellular Substance, that it is difficult to separate them, without lacerating both the Vitreous Coat and its Humour. Some Authors describe an Aqueous Humour as seated between the Lens and its Capsule *, while others, of no small respectability, deny the existence of this Humour, as well as of that which is said to be situated between the Lamellae of the Lens. The Vessels of the Lens are not to be seen in the Eye of the Adult; but in that of a Foetus, Petit found Ves- sels passing from the Corpus Ciliare over the fore part of the Capsule of the Lens. Winslow afterwards observed, that in the Foetus, and in new-born Children, a fine Injection succeeded so well, as to discover the Vessels of the Membrana Crystallina and Vitrea;â€”and in a Foetus of about six months, the injected liquor seemed to him to have pe- netrated a part of the Crystalline and Vitreous Hu- mours.

109 Part IV.] OF THE MOUTH, &c. They The sides of the Tongue are fixed to the Lower Jaw and Styloid Processes, and parts adjacent, by Membra- nous Ligaments. The Tongue is chiefly composed of the Fibres of the Muscles, which serve for its motions.—These Fibres are disposed in various directions, and intermixed with Me- dullary Fat. The upper and lateral parts of the Tongue are com- posed of the Stylo-Glossi.—Its middle portion, between the two former Muscles, is formed of the Linguales.— The lower part is chiefly formed of the Genio-Glossi; —and behind, the Stylo-Glossi enter into its composi- tion. The Tongue is covered by a continuation of the com- mon Integuments, which are preserved soft and moist by the Saliva. The Cuticle of the Tongue forms Vaginae for receiv- ing the Substances called Papilla:. The Corpus Mucosum of the Tongue is thicker than in other parts of the Body, but more moist. The third Covering of the Tongue, the Cutis Vera, is very plentifully supplied with Nerves.—The Papillae, which take their origin from it, are very Vascular, es- pecially near the Apex of the Tongue, but are wanting on its under Surface. The Papilla: are divided into three kinds, the Maxi- maMedia, and Minima:. The first class, called Papilla: Maxima:, Lenticulares Capitatavel Vallatce, are by much the largest, and of a Lenticular form, having round Heads and short Stems.

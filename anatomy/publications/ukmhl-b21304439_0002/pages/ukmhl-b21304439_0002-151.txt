139 Part IV.] OF THE MOUTH, &c. the wings of the Thyroid Cartilage, and has its anterior narrow part fixed to the under edge of that Cartilage. It has four small Articular Surfaces, with distinct Capsular Ligaments, of which tvyo are placed above, for the articulation of the Arytenoid Cartilages, and two at the under and lateral parts, for the connection of the inferior Cornua pf the Thyroid Cartilage- The Cricoid Cartilage forms part of the general Tube of the Trachea, constitutes the Base of the Larynx, and gives a firm support to the Arytenoid Cartilages. The two Ai'ytenoid Cartilages are much smaller than the other Cartilages, and are placed upon the upper, posterior, and lateral parts of the Cricoid Cartilage, at a small distance from each other. They are of a triangular form, and a little twisted, and are bent back, so as to have a broad concave Sur- face behind. Their upper extremities, or Cornua, are turned to- wards each other, and are now and then found loose in the form of Appendices, which are considered by some Authors as distinct Cartilages, and termed Cuneiform or Tubercidated. Their Bases are broad and hollow, where they are articulated by Capsular Ligaments with the Cricoid Cartilage, upon which they are moved in different di- rections, by the action of various Muscles. They are connected to each other, and to the adja- cent Cartilages, by different Muscles and Ligaments. The Arytenoid Cartilages form a part of the Opening called Glottis, and give attachment to its Ligaments. The Epiglottis, obtaining its name from its situation - above

OF THE FOETUS. 301 Part IV.] It lies over the Pericardium, and occupies the space where the Aorta sends off the Carotid and Subclavian Arteries, and extends a short way into the fore part of the Neck. It has two Long Cornua above, and two Broad Lobes below, is of a pale red colour, and becomes afterwards of a. darker hue. A white Serous Liquor can frequently be squeezed from its Substance; but it has no Excretory Duct; nor is the use of the Fluid, nor of the Gland itself, yet ascer- tained. Some Anatomists are of opinion, that the white Fluid is Chyle sent by a retrograde motion from the Thoracic Duct, and that the Thymus Gland is a Diverticulum to the Chyle when too great a quantity of Lymph is sent to the Subclavian Vein. In the Adult, the Thymus Gland is so completely ab- sorbed, that scarcely any thing but Cellular Substance remains in its place. The Blood-vessels of the Thymus are Branches of the Subclavian and Internal Mammary; the Nerves come from the Great Sympathetics and Eighth Pair. Its Lymphatics have not yet been very accurately traced. The Lungs are small, firm, and of a dark red colour, and sink when thrown into Water, in consequence of the Bronchial Cells having not yet received Air. But if Air be admitted to them, by Putrefaction or otherwise, they swim in Water, in the same manner as if Air had been conveyed to them in consequence of Respiration. The Valve of Eustachius is distinct in the Foetus, but

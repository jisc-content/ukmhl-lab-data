r,r> OF THE VISCERA, &c. [Part IV. Optic Nerve and Retina. The Optic Nen>e, in its passage through the Orbi‘, is covered by a continuation of the Membranes which surround the Brain. At the Foramen Opticum, the Dura Mater is divided into two Lamina, one of which assists in forming the Periosteum of the Orbit; the other, which is again divided into two Laminae, furnishes a Sheath to the Nerve, and accompanies it to the Tunica Sclerotica, to which it is so firmly connected by Cellular Substance, ns to have induced some Authors to describe the Sclero- tica as a continuation of the Dura Mater. The Body of the Nerve is still more closely invested by the Pia Mater, which also forms Sheaths round the Nervous Fasciculi, and accompanies the Nerve into the Eye. At the back part of the Ball of the Eye, and a little removed from the Axis, towards the Nose, the Fasciculi of the Optic Nerve pass through a Cribriform part of the Sclerotic and Choroid Coats. The Nerve is contracted at its entrance through the Sclerotic Coat, but immediately after its ingress, it ex- pands to form the Retina,—so called from its supposed Reticular appearance. In the centre of the Optic Nerve, where it enters the Eye, the Artery of the Retina is seen dividing into Branches, which are dispersed upon its inner Surface. The Retina advances between the Choroid Coat and Capsule of the Vitreous Humour, to the fore part of the

OF THE VISCERA, 5tc. [Part IV, 102 1 The Right or Pulmonary Ventricle is situated on { the fore side of the Heart, is of a triangular form, and much thicker and stronger than the corresponding J Auricle. It has many strong Eminences, Columns, Lacertuli, or Cords, called Columnce Carnecc. The Columnce run in different directions, but the strongest of them longitudinally, and arc of various sizes, forming so many distinct Muscles, which are ex- tremely compact in their structure, and compose a beau- tiful, intricate, and irregular Net-work. In general, they adhere through their whole length to each other, or to the sides of the Ventricle; but many of them are loose in their middle, and inay be raised by a Probe put under them. They assist the Ventricle in its Systole or Contraction, and prevent it from being overstretched in its Diastole or dilatation, and agitate the Blood in its passage through the Ventricle. They are supposed to bring the opposite sides of the Ventricle completely together, during its contraction. Pi Between the Columnce are many deep Grooves, Pits, or Fovea:, into all of which the Blood readily enters. Around the Passage, between the Auricle and Ven- tricle, there is a Tendinous Margin or Ring, from the whole edge of which a circular Membrane is sent off, called Valvula Tricuspis, or Triglochin, from its having three principal points or divisions. From the edge of the Tricuspid Valve, many small round Tendinous Cords of unequal size are sent offâ€™. The Chordae Tendineae descend obliquely within the Ventricle

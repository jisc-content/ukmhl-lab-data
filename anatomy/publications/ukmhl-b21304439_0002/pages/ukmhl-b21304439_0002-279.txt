PartIV.] ORGANS OF GENERATION. 2ll The Cavity, like the external part of the Uterus, is of a triangular form.) but is small in proportion to the size of the Organ,—being scarcely capable of contain- ing the Kernel of an Almond,—and has its sides closely applied to each other. It is covered externally through its whole length with a smooth polished Coat, continued from the Peritoneum, which, after covering the beginning of the Vagina, es- pecially at its under or back part, is reflected forwards upon the Bladder, backwards over the Rectum, and la- terally towards the sides of the Pelvis. Its Substance is of a compact, cellular, and fleshy na- ture, and plentifully supplied with Blood-vessels : The Fleshy Fibres, however, are seen distinctly only in the Gravid Uterus. It is remarkably Vascular in its Body, less so in its Cervix, and is nearly of the same thickness throughout, excepting at its Corners, where the Uterine or Fallopian Tubes terminate. It is lined with a fine and very Vascular Membrane, of a somewhat Porous and Villous appearance, in which the Arteries terminate which discharge the Menstrual Fluid. The Cavity of the Cervix has tzzo small Longitudinal Lines projecting in it, one in the anterior, the other in the posterior part, on each side of which are numerous R/igce. The Llugce run in an oblique transverse direction, and are formed, not only of the inner Membrane, bin also by the Fibres whicli compose the Body of the U- terus. Between

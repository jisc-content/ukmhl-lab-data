Cuvier considers the Corpora Cavernosa as being ; formed of a texture extremely complicated, of ramifica- tions of Blood-vessels, and particularly of Veins. The Corpora Cavernosa are united to each other by ja Sepiarn, formed by a continuation of the Elastic Li- igaments which cover these Bodies. The Septum Penis is composed of firm Tendinous-like (Cords, extending across, nearly in a parallel direction, tfrom the Dorsum Penis to the Corpus Spongiosum 1 Urethras, and thus guarding against an over-distension. Between the different Cords Fissures are left, through which the Blood, or an Injected Fluid, passes without (obstruction, from one of the Corpora Cavernosa to the cother, rendering the Penis in this manner one general (Cavity, separated by the Septum into two apartments. The Corpus Spongiosum Urcthrce is situated under and (between the Corpora Cavernosa Penis, but projects con- siderably beyond them. It begins a little behind the part where the Corpora (Cavernosa are united, adheres to them by condensed (Cellular Substance, and .terminates at the anterior ex- tremity of the Penis. It has an external Covering similar to that of the (Corpora Cavernosa Penis, but more delicate, and has more of a Membranous appearance. The posterior part of the Corpus Spongiosum is di- lated into a Longitudinal Prominence, of a Conical form, ituated within the Skin of the Perinoeum, and termed R 3 Pull>

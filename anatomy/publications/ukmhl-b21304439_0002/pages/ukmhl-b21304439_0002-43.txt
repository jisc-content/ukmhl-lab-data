Part IV.] 31 OF THE BRAIN. Glandiila Pituitaria, and thus, contrary to the opinion of the Ancients, preventing the passage of any Pituitous Fluid from it to the Nose. The Glandula Pituitaria is of an oval form, about the size of a field-bean, lodged in the Sella Turcica, and surrounded by a doubling of the Dura Mater. On the outside, it is of a brownish colour, being formed of Cineritious Matter : It is whiter within, where it is mixed with Medullary Substance. The Glandula Pituitaria was formerly supposed to absorb a Fluid from the Infundibulum, and transmit it to the Nose. It has been already mentioned, however, that the Infundibulum is impervious; and the real use of this Gland, as well as of the other Tubercles of the Brain, seems still unknown. At the fore part of the third Ventricle, and imme- diately before the Anterior Crura of the Fornix, there is a white Medullary Cord, which runs transversely through the Corpora Striata, uniting these together, and having the name of Commissura Cerebri Ante- rior. At the back part of the third Ventricle, and under the root of the Pineal Gland, there is another Cord similar to the former, but shorter, called Commissura Cerebri Posterior. The Commissura Cerebri assist in uniting the two sides of the Brain to which they are fixed. From the under and back part of the third Ventricle, there is a Passage which leads to the fourth, under the name ol Iter ad Quartum Ventriculum, Canalis Medius, vel Aqua duct us Sylvii. After

no OF THE VISCERA, &c. [PartIV, the I hey are placed at the Base of the Tongue, in super- ficial Fossilise, and the whole are arranged in such a manner as to form an Angle with its point backwards. They are Glands of the Salivary kind, and have each of them a small Perforation in the middle of its convex Surface. â€¢ Besides the Papillae Capitatae, there are numerous Mucous Follicles, which cover the greater part of the Surface of the root of the Tongue. At the root of the Tongue, and behind the Angle formed by the Papillae Maximae, there is a Hole called Foramen Ccccuvi of Morgagnt, by whom it was first described. It penetrates only a small way into the Substance of the Tongue, and receives the Mouths of several Excre- tory Ducts which terminate in it. The second class, called Papillcc Media?, Semi-lenti- cular cs, vel Fungiformes, are much smaller than the former, and are scattered over the upper Surface of the Tongue, at some distance from each other. They are of a Cylindrical form, supported on a small Pedicle, and terminated by a round extremity. The third class, called Papilla? Minima?, vel Conica?, vel Villosce, are by much the most numerous, but very minute. They occupy almost the whole upper Surface of the Tongue, becoming gradually shorter at its sides, and are most abundant towards the Apex, where the sensation of taste is most acute. This and the second class have been supposed to be formed chiefly of the extremities of Nerves, and to con- stitute the real Organ of Taste ; though other parts, as

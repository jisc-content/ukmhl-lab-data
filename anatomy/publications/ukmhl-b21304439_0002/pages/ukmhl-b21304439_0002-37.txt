Part IV.] OF THE BRAIN. 25 two Lateral Ventricles ; and the under part of this roof, which is smooth and uniform, constitutes the upper part of these Ventricles. Vieussens considered the Centrum Ovale as the Great Dispensatory of the Animal Spmls. The Ventricles of the Biâ€™ain are four in number, two of which are called Lateral. The four Ventricles have their sides contiguous to each other, are chiefly formed of Medullary Matter, and are lined with a continuation of the Pia Mater, which differs, however, from that part of the Membrane cover- ing the exterior Surface of the Brain, in having fewer Vessels dispersed upon it. They are constantly moistened by a Fluid, which prevents their opposite sides from adhering to each other. The Use of the Ventricles, as of many other parts of the Brain, is still unknown. The Lateral, formerly called Supeiior Ventricles, are situated in the Hemispheres, one in each, and run aL first horizontally in the same direction w ith the Hemi- spheres themselves. They are of an irregular form, lying under the Cen- trum Ovale, and have each three winding Corners, compared to Rams Horns, which are therefore called Cornua. The Anterior Cornua are separated from each other only by the Septum Lucidum. The Posterior Cornua, called also Digital Cavities, are at a considerable distance from each other, but ap- proach nearer at their pointed extremities; while the Inferior

29 Part IV.] OF THE BRAIN. The Body of the Fornix is joined above to the Septum Lucidum ; and below, it is connected to the Thalanii Optici by a Vascular Membrane, called Tela Clv>roideay which spreads over the Thalami, and unites the Choroid Plexus of the Lateral Ventricles. The Pedes Hippocampi, Cornua Ammonis, or Great Hippocampus,—named from a supposed resem- blance to these parts,—are two Medullary Eminences, which arise from the sides of the posterior extremity of the Corpus Callosum, and are situated in the inferior Prolongations of the Lateral Ventricles. They run through the whole extent of the Prolonga- tions, first behind, then at the outer part of the Poste- rior Pillars of the Fornix, and are so intimately con- nected with them, that they have been considered by some Authors as forming part of the Pillars themselves. They are small at their Origin, from which they con- tinue to increase to their farther extremity. Like the greater part of the Ventricles, they are co- vered externally with a Medullary Lamina-,—internally, they are found to consist of Medullary and Cineritious Laminae, which have a convoluted appearance. At the inner edge of the Pedes Hippocampi, there is a plaited, serrated, or indented Margin, which, in the generality of Quadrupeds, is much larger, in propor- tion to the size of the Brain, than it is in Man. The resemblance, however, to the human kind, in the struc- ture of this particular part of the Brain, is more strik- ing in the Ape than in any other Quadruped. In the bottom of the Lateral Ventricles, behind the anterior Crura of the Fornix, and before the meeting of

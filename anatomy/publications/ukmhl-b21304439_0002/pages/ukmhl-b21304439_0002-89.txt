OF THE EAR. Part IV. j middle, and from an inch to an inch and a half in length. Its outer end, which is a continuation of the Concha, is Cartilaginous, and has two or three Interruptions or Fissures in it. On the upper and back part of its circumference, there is a Large Interruption terminating in an oblique Mar- gin, which is fixed to the rough edge, at the under part of the Osseous Portion of the Meatus. At the upper and back part of the Meatus, the Car- tilage has but little connection with the Bones, being there fixed by the Skin which lines the Canal. The Osseous is continued from the Cartilaginous part of the Canal, and is the longer of the two, particularly at its upper and back part. The Meatus is lined with a continuation of the Skin, which fills up the Interruptions in the Cartilage, but, like the Skin covering the Auricle, it is thinner than on the rest of the Body. Under the Skin of the Meatus, and near its outer end, there are numerous small Glands, of a yellowish colour, placed in a Reticular Substance formed of the Corpus Mucosum, and termed Glandules Ceruminosec, which discharge the Wax of the Ear, through small excretory Ducts. The Wax lubricates the Passage, and defends it from the injuries of the air, and, being of a viscid and bitter quality, assists in the exclusion of insects. The Arteries of the external Ear come anteriorly from the Temporal, and posteriorly from the Occipital both

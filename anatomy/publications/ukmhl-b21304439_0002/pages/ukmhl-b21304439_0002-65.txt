OF THE EYE. 5S Part IV.] D 3 sels rise to the supposed existence of the Membrana Ruys- chiana. It is also furnished with numerous Nerves, which are united with its Vessels by a fine Cellular Texture. In the Human Eye, the Choroides is of a dusky brown colour, both externally and internally; but the colour varies considerably in the Eyes of different Ani- mals. The inner Surface of this Coat, which is Villous, was described by Ruysch as a distinct Lamina, and has been termed by many Anatomists Tunica Ruyschiana.—Hal- ler, however, Zinn, and many others who follow- ed them, have demonstrated this Coat to consist of only one Lamina; though in Sheep, and in some of the larger Animals, it appears to be double. • Upon the inner side of the Choroides, there is a Mu- cus, the colour of which, in different Animals, is found to have some connection with the general colour of the Hair and Skin, though commonly, in the Human Body, it is of a blackish brown, and termed Pigmmt'im Ni- grum ; the darkness of the shade, however, still corre- sponding with that of the Hair. It is supposed to be produced from the Vessels of this Coat, and is blackest and thickest at the fore part of the Eye, where it ad- heres so tenaciously as to be removed with difficulty but behind it is thinner, more fluid, and more easily re- moved -, becoming gradually less evident towards the Optic Nerve, round which it almost disappears. In advanced age, the Pigmentum Nigrum becomes more diluted, and of a lighter colour, so that the Ves-

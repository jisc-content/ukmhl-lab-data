34- OF THE VISCERA, &c. [Part IV. till it distend the Cellular Substance, and separate the Coats from each other. It has two middle Eminences, called Appendices Ver- miformes, from their resemblance to Earth-worms, one of which is situated anteriorly and superiorly, the other inferiorly and posteriorly. Each of the Lobes of the Cerebellum is again divided into Monticuli or Lobules, which have different names according to their relative situations, connections with other parts, &c. They vary a little in different Sub- jects, but are easily distinguished from the direction of their Convolutions. The Substance of the Cerebellum consists in Cineri- tious and Medullary Matter, as in the Cerebrum; but the Cineritious bears a greater proportion to the Me- dullary in the former than in the latter. When the Cerebellum is cut in a vertical direction, the Medullary part is then found to bear a striking re- semblance to the branching of the Shrub called Arbor Vilce : from which circumstance it has obtained the name of this Shrub. When cut in slices nearly parallel to the Base of the Brain, the Medullary Substance appears in Laminae corresponding to those of the Surface of the Cerebel- lum ; and when cut to a considerable depth, there is, as in the Cerebrum, a Centrum Medullare uniting the La- teral Lobes. Between the Cerebellum, the under part of the Tu- ber Annulare, and upper part of the Medulla Oblon- gata, the Fourth Ventricle is situated, which extends from

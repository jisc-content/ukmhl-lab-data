165 Part IV.] OF THE THORAX. L 3 Of sponding Pits or Depressions within, and are called, from their Discoverer, Sinus Valsalvae. The Sinuses of Valsalva are of the same nature with those Dilatations which are found in the Veins and Lym- phatics, between their Sides and Valves; and, like them, are partly formed by the pressure of the Fluids upon the sides of the Vessels. The Pulmonary Artery receives the Blood from the Right Ventricle, and, by its contractile power, assists the Ventricle in driving it through the Lungs. The Semilunar Valves, pressed back by the Blood in the Artery, prevent its return into the Ventricle. The Valves are opened again in consequence of their being driven towards the sides of the Artery by the cur- rent of the Blood, upon the next contraction or stroke of the Ventricle. The Pulmonary Artery passes behind the Sternum, and separates into Right and Left Branches, which go to the corresponding parts of the Lungs. The two Branches of the Pulmonary Artery, like those of the Arteries of the Viscera in other parts of the large Cavities, suddenly divide into still smaller Branches. From the extreme Arteries of the Lungs, correspond- ing Veins arise, which are merely the continuation or reflection of the Arteries, without any intermediate Cells or dilatations. The Pulmonary Veins, in the Substance of the Lungs, gradually unite, and form Four Principal Trunks, which terminate in, and carry the Blood to, the Left Auricle,

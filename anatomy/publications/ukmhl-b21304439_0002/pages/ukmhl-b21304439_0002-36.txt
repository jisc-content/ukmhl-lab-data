OF THE VISCERA, &c. [Part IV. 24 carrying red Blood ; but it is uniform, and without any appearance of a Fibrous Texture. The inner Substance is termed While or Medullary, and is considered as giving origin to the different Nerves. It has been by some called Excretory, having been supposed to be formed of hollow Tubes continued from the Vessels of the Cortical part; but no Cavities have ever been observed in the soft Fibres of which it is composed. It is greater in quantity, and somewhat firmer in tex- ture, than the Cineritious Substance, with which it is so intimately connected, as to appear to be a continuation of it.—The soft Fibres or Streaks of the Medullary Matter, run in general in a parallel and transverse di- rection. In many parts of the Cineritious Substance, Medul- lary Matter appears; and, on the contrary, in different parts of the Medullary Substance, Cineritious Matter is found ; the two being frequently blended together in the form of Streaks. See Monro on the Nervous System. The Centrum Ovale of Vieussens. This is the Me- dullary Substance of the Brain, forming a kind of Nu- cleus, which is seen after removing the Cineritious Sub- stance, and all the Medullary parts mixed with it, which lie between the Cortical Convolutions. To obtain a proper view of the Centrum Ovale, the Nucleus ought to be cut in such a manner as to preserve the Corpus Callosum, and the same convexity with that pf the general convexity of the Brain. The Centrum Ovale forms an Arch or Hoof ov.er the two ri ■ ,

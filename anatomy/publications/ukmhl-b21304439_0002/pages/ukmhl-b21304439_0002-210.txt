In genera], they are about six times the length of the Body to which they belong ; though, in a person of short stature, the proportional length of the Intestines is greater, and vice versa. They occupy a large part of the Abdomen, and are connected to the Body through their whole extent, by a Doubling of the Peritoneum. On account of the inequalities of their size, they^ire divided into Small and Large Intestines, and each ol these again have their subdivisions. Small Intestines. The Small Intestines are smooth on their outer Sur- iaee, and of a tapering form, becoming gradually less in their diameter from their upper to their under extre- mity, and arc divided into the Duodenum, Jejunum, and Ilium. The Duodenum begins at the Pylorus, and makes a short turn upwards and backwards, by the Neck of the Gall-Bladder, to which it is contiguous *, having the Anterior Layer of the Omentum fixed to its inferior part, and the Omentum Minus to its opposite side. It then passes obliquely downwards and to the right side, before the Great Vessels which go into the Liver, and likewise before the lienal Artery and Vein; the Gut being included in the Cellular Substance of the Meso-colon. Opposite to the under part of the Kidney, it makes a turn

They become smaller and smaller, till at length they orm an infinite number of Capillary Tubes, which, di- jating, end in the Cells of the Lungs. The Cells of the Lungs, in a Child, are barely visible o the naked Eye. In the Adult they are larger, and n both they communicate so freely together, that, upon introducing Air into a Bronchial Tube of moderate size, large portion of the Lungs may be inflated. The Trachea consists of Cartilaginous Rings, about lixteen or eighteen in number, which give strength and rrmncss to it, and preserve it constantly open for the transmission of Air. They are incomplete, however, eehind, where the Trachea is formed of a soft Fleshy uubstance, which yields to the Esophagus in the time of deglutition. Each Cartilage forms a large Segment of a Circle, jDout a line or one-twelfth of an inch in breadth, and nne-fourth of a line in thickness. The Cartilages are situated horizontally, with their ilges opposed to each other j small spaces intervening 3?tween them. They are united to each other by a Ligamentous Sub- ance, which is so elastic, that when the Lungs are â–  ken out of the Body, it draws the Cartilages closely ggether. I At the upper end of the Trachea, two or three of the artilages are frequently joined by an union of Sub- iance; but below this, they are perfectly distinct from cch other, The last pf the Cartilages is now and then Vol. II.

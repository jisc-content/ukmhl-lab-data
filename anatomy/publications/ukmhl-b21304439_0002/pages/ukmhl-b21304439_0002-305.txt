It has a Spongy and Villous appearance, and is full of small Blood-vessels, which can be readily injected from those of the Uterus. The True Chorion is thinner, smoother, and much denser, than the former, is connected with the Spongy Chorion as far as the edge of the Placenta, where it separates from it. It is next reflected over the Suriaqe of the Placenta which is opposed to the Foetus, and is afterwards continued over the whole of the Cord. It is uniform in its texture, has a transparent appear- ance, adheres to the Spongy Chorion and Surface of the Placenta by a delicate Cellular Substance, and has no Vessels visible to the naked Eye, or which can be injected. I he Amnios lines the Surface of the True Chorion, and, with it, is reflected from the Placenta upon the Cord, which it supplies with an External Covering. It is thinner, (but at this period stronger), more dense, and transparent, than (he Chorion, to which it adheres every where by a tough Jelly. It is smooth and polished on the side next the Foetus, and is destitute of Blood-vessels. The Membranes, besides containing the Child and Waters, give origin to the latter, and, m the tune cf Labour, assist in opening the Orifice of the Uterus. The Waters, called Liquor Amnii, are thinnest and clearest in the first Months, after which they acquire some degree of colour and ropiness. The Liquor Amnii is chiefly composed of the Serum of

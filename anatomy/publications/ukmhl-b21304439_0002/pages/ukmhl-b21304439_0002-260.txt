252 OF THE VISCERA, &c. [Part IV. Substance.â€”The Cord is covered by the Cremaster, and within it, by the same Process of the Peritoneum which lorms the Tunica Vaginalis Testis, and which is now called the Tunica Vaginalis of the Spermatic Cord. Here, however, the Process is so incorporated with the common Cellular Substance of the Cord, as to appear to form part of it. The under part of the Vagina of the Cord is separated by a Partition formed by the upper end of the Vaginal Coat of the Testicle, and by condensed Cellular Sub- stance, so that no Liquor can pass easily from the Cord to the Testicle, or vice versa. The Arteries of the Testes, termed Artericc Spcrma- ticce, and Artericc Preparantcs, arise, one on each side, from the fore part of the Aorta, a little below the Renal Arteries, opposite to, but at a little distance from, each other. The Spermatic Artery crosses over the Psoas Muscle and Ureter, and descends, behind the Peritoneum, to the under part of the Abdomen. At the lower part of the Abdomen, it perforates the Ring of the Obliquus Externus, and passes in the Sper- matic Cord to the Testicle. In its descent, it gives Branches to the adjacent parts, and is so interlaced with the corresponding Veins, as to have been supposed by the Ancients to have large la- teral communications with them. After passing the Ring, it divides into Branches which go to the Testis at its posterior edge. They are partly dispersed upon the Epididymis, but the larger Branches run

308 OF THE VISCERA, &c. [Part IV. Branches ; or, according to that of the greater part of modern Authors,â€”by Absorption. By the Umbilical Vein, it goes principally to be cir- culated in the Liver; a small portion of it passing by the Ductus Venosus to the Right Auricle of the Heart. The Blood sent from the Inferior Cava is transmitted first to the Right Auricle, then, by the Foramen Ovale, directly to the Left Auricle; and that sent by the Su- perior Cava is transmitted to the Right Auricle and Ventricle, and from thence to the Pulmonary Artery. From the Pulmonary Artery one portion of it passes through the Circulation of the Lungs, and another goes by the Ductus Arteriosus to the Aorta Dcscendens. From the Lungs it is returned by the Pulmonary Veins to the Left Auricle, where it mixes with that coming from the Right Auricle by the Foramen Ovale, and is sent by the Aorta to the different parts of the Body. From the Iliac Arteries, it is conveyed by the Umbi- lical Branches to the Substance of the Placenta, where one portion of it returns by corresponding Veins to the Foetus, the rest going to the Uterus in the manner it was discharged from the Uterine Arteries to the Branches of the Umbilical Vein.

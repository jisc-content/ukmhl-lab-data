Part IV.] S7 OF THE BRAIN. C 3 and between the Third, and the latter between the Sixth Pair of Nerves. These two Foramina penetrate only a little way at the edges of the Tuber, and receive a Plexus of Vessels. The Substance of the Tuber is intermixed with a con- siderable quantity of Cortical Matter, formed into Stria running in different directions. Continued from the Tuber, there is a large Substance in form of an inverted Cone, which extends to the Fo- ramen Magnum of the Occipital Bone, under the name of Medulla Oblongata. Upon the Surface of the Medulla Oblongata, two small Eminences appear, which run longitudinally, and contiguous to each other, and, from their shape, have the name of Corpora Pyramidalia, or Eminentia Pyra- midales. Between the Corpora Pyramidalia, there is a deep Fissure, into which the Pia Mater penetrates, and where Blood-vessels pass into the interior part of the Medulla. At the outside of the former Eminences, are two others, somewhat of the figure of Olives, from which they are termed Coipora Olivaria, or Eminentia Oli- vares. More externally than these, are other two Eminen- ces, less evident than the last, which have been describ- ed by some Authors under the name of Corpora Pyra- midalia Lateralia. The Medulla Oblongata is divided into two lateral Portions, by an anterior and posterior Fissure. These two Portions are formed of Medullary- Matter without,

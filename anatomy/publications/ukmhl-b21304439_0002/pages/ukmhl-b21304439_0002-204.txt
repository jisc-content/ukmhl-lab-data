The right part of the Stomach is situated under the left part of the Liver, the rest of it is placed immediate- ly under the Diaphragm j and in the upright position of the Body, the Stomach rests upon the Intestines. The Stomach is long, round, and tapering, and has been compared in shape to the Bag of a Bagpipe, or to a Cone, with the Base drawn back, towards the summit. The size is in proportion to the quantity of Aliment it has been accustomed to receive, and therefore is com- monly larger in Men than in Women.

The Large, called also the Left Extremity, or Base, is situated in the Left Hypochondriac Region, and forms the great Cul de Sac of the French. This is in contact with the Spleen, and is considerably higher than the Small or Bight Extremity, or small Cul de Sac, which is placed in the Epigastric Region, and approaches more or less towards the Right Hypochondrium, in propor- tion as the Stomach happens to be more or less dis- tended. The Upper Surface is turned towards the Diaphragm, the Under towards the Intestines ;—but when the Abdo- men is laid open,—unless the Stomach be considerably distended,—the superior Surface becomes anterior, and the inferior Surface posterior. The Large Curvature is turned obliquely forwards and downwards

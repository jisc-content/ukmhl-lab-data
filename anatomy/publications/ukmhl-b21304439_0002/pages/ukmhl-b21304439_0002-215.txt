Part IV.] OF THE ABDOMEN. 20V It passes from the fore-part of the Sinus of the Porta, to the under and back part of the Liver, to be connect- ed to the whole edge of the small Curvature ot the Sto- mach, and to the beginning of the Duodenum. Like the other Omentum, it is composed of two Layers, but is thinner, less fat, and more uniform in its structure, and also differs from it in having no reflec- tion upwards. After the Omentum Minus reaches the Stomach, its two Layers separate from each other, inclose that Vis- cus, and form its External Coat. At the Great Curvature of the Stomach, they rejoin, and form the Anterior, and then the reflected or Pos- terior part of the Omentum Majus. The Posterior part separates again into two Layers, which inclose the Colon, and form its External Coat. At the opposite side of the Colon, the Layers re-unite, and form the Meso-colon. By the Membrane thus continued, a large irregular Bag is formed, of which the Omentum Minus, Sto- mach, and anterior portion of the Omentum Majus, constitute the anterior, and the reflection of the Large Omentum, the Colon, and Meso-colon, the posterior part. At the upper and right side of the Sac, there is a Passage large enough to admit a Finger, termed Fora- men Winslowi. It is situated immediately behind the Cord of the Great Vessels which lead to the Liver, and is of a Semi- circular form. It is composed of the Peritoneum, under the appear- ance

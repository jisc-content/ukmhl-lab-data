The Cord of Vessels and Nerves is intermixed with much Cellular Substance, and covered externally by a Reflection of the Peritoneum, which has obtained the name of Capsule of Gljsson. The Branches of the Vessels and Nerves accompany each other through the Substance of the Liver, form- ing small Fasciculi, in a manner somewhat similar to the Fasciculus of which the Cord is formed by their Trunks. In their course through the Liver, the Branches of the different Vessels and Nerves, but particularly those of the Vena Portae, are inclosed in a large portion of Cellular Substance, which is also frequently called Cap- sule o/'Glisson, from that Author supposing it to be a continuation of the Capsule which covers the Vessels before they enter the Liver. The Hepatic Attery is derived from the Coeliac, and is dispersed throughout the whole Substance of the Liver, and also upon the Coat which covers it, and is so small, when compared with the Bulk of the Liver, as to have been generally supposed to be destined for the nourishment merely of that Viscus ; but from injec- tions passing from the Artery to the Biliary Ducts, and from other causes, it has been supposed by some Ana- tomists, that the Hepatic Artery is not only intended to nourish the Liver, but is capable of secreting part of the Bile;—and this supposition is farther confirmed, from the Vena Portae having, in a recent case, been found wanting, while at the same time the Hepatic .i Artery

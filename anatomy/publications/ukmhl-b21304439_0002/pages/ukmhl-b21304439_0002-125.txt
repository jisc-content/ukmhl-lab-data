113 Fart IV.] OF THE MOUTH, &c. The Vol. II. H the Parotid, and is situated on the inside of the Angle of the Lower Jaw, between it and the Tendon of the Digastricus, and directly under the Platysma Myoides. From the upper and fore part of this Gland, a Duct arises, called, by some Authors, Ductus Whartoni, vel Ductus Inferior, which is much thinner in its coats than the former Duct, but longer. It passes forwards between the Mylo-Hyoideus and Genio-Glossus, along the under and inner edge of the Sublingual Gland, to the side of the Fraenum Linguae, and terminates behind the Dentes Incisores, by a small Orifice in form of a Papilla. The Sublingual Gland is smaller, longer, and softer than the Submaxillary, and is flat, and of an oval form. It is situated under the anterior lateral portion of the Tongue, above the Duct of the Inferior Maxillary Gland, near the Lower Jaw, between the Mylo-PIyoi- deus and Genio-Hyo-Glossus j the former of which sustains it. Its extremities are turned forwards and backwards, and the edges obliquely inwards and outwards. It is covered by a continuation of the Skin of the under side of the Tongue, which fixes the Gland in its place. It opens by several Orifices arranged in a line near the Gums, a little to the outside of the Fraenum. Sometimes this Gland sends off a Duct which com- municates with that of the Submaxillary ; but generally it is otherwise. In many Quadrupeds, there is a distinct Duct belong- ing to this Gland, like that of the Submaxillary.

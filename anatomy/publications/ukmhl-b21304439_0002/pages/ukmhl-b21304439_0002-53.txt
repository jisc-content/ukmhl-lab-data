Part IV.] OF THE EYE. 41 OF THE EYE. The Eyes, which constitute the Organ of Vision, are situated in the Cavities of the Orbits, and are sur- rounded by several parts, some of which protect them from injury, and others assist in the performance of their various motions. The Orbits are of a conical figure, situated in the fore part of the Cranium, with their Apices behind, their Axes in an horizontal direction, and their Bases turned obliquely outwards. They are formed of different Processes of the follow- ing Bones, viz. The upper part of each Orbit, by the Orbitar Plate of the Frontal Bone;—the inferior, by the Orbitar Plates of the superior Maxillary and Malar Bones ;—the internal, chiefly by the Orbitar part of the Os Unguis and Pars Plana of the Ethmoid Bone ;—the external, by the Or- bitar Plates of the Sphenoid and Malar Bones ;—the posterior, by the Sphenoid and Palate Bones ;—and the anterior

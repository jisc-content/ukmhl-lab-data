179 Part IV.] OF THE THORAX. 1 may be traced considerably farther, in the Substance of the Lungs, than the Cartilages ; A very Vascular and Irritable Membrane, continued from the Mouth, which lines the inner side of the Tra- • chea, and forms at last the extreme Branches, which i terminate in the Cells of the Lungs. The inner Membrane of the Trachea is every where i perforated by the Ducts of Mucous Glands, and by the Mouths of the Exhalent Arteries, the former pouring out Mucus to lubricate the Lungs, the latter the Vapour ■ which is thrown off in Perspiration. Three different kinds of Glands are connected witli tthe Trachea,—the Thyroid, the Tracheal, and the . Bronchial. The Thyroid Gland has its name from its connection 'with the Thyroid Cartilage, though more immediately ^connected with the Trachea. It is a large Mass, of a deep red colour, situated at tthe under and fore part of the Larynx, behind the ! Sterno-Hyoidei and Sterno-thyroidei, and is propor- tionally larger in Man than in any other Animal. It has two triangular Lobes placed at the under and ! lateral parts of the Larynx, descending over two or tthree Rings of the Trachea, and also part of the Eso- jphagus, with the Bases of the Lobes undermost. The Lobes are joined by an intermediate portion, (called Isthmus, which lies across the upper and fore part (of the Trachea. * Sometimes a Process from the middle Portion, which ’may be mistaken for a Muscle, ascends between the M 2 Sterno-

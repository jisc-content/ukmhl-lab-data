171 Part IV.] OF THE THORAX. The other passes partly between the Left Auricle and Ventricle, and partly in the Groove between the Vem- tricles, on the fore side of the Heart,—supplying the ; left side of the Heart, and communicating with the Branches of the other Artery on its upper and under : Surfaces. The Coronary Arteries are entirely dispersed upon the substance of the Heart, and upon the roots of the great Vessels, forming upon these some of the minute Branches, termed Vasa Vasorwn. The Coronary Arteries, from their situation opposite to the Valves, have been supposed to be filled at a diffe- rent time from that of the rest of the Arterious System ; —but from Experiment, it seems now sufficiently ascer- tained, that the Coronary Vessels have their Pulsation at the same instant with the other Arteries. The Coronary Veins return the Blood from their cor- responding Arteries. The greater part of them join into a Trunk, called the Great Cm-onary Vein, which, after making a turn from the left side, and running be- tween the Left Auricle and Ventricle, terminates jn the under and back part of the Right Auricle, where it i§ covered by its Semilunar Valve. Other Coronary Veins, much smaller than the for- mer, terminate in different parts of the right side of the Heart. The Absorbents of the Heart go to tire neighbouring Lymphatic Glands. The Nerves are from the Great Sympathetics and Eighth Pair. With respect to the Circulation of the Blood in gene- ral :—

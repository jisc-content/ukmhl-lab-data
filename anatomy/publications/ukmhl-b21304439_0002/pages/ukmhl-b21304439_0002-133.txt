121 Part IV.] OF THE MOUTH, &c. In the Upper Jaw, they are placed immediately un- der the Orbitar Plates, and are termed Eye-Teeth, from a supposed connection with the Eyes. The two below are placed almost as deep as the Base of the Bone, and are called Angular Teeth, from supporting the Angles of the Mouth. The Bicuspidati, formerly termed Small Molares, or First and Second Grinders, are situated behind the Cus- pidati, and bear an intermediate resemblance between these and the Molares. Viewed in the Jaws, they are somewhat like each other, and not unlike the Cuspidati. The Body of each has two points upon its grinding Surface, one external, the other internal; and those in the Upper Jaw are nearly upon a level. In the Under Jaw the points pro- ject most on the outside of the Teeth. The Enamel is nearly equal in thickness round the Body of the Tooth, but is thinner at the sides than on the Cuspidati. The Fangs resemble two Fangs united, with a de- pression between them ; sometimes, however, the Bi- cuspidati of the Upper Jaw have distinct roots. The Bicuspidati of the Under Jaw are smaller than those of the upper one, the points on their grinding Surfaces are not so distinct, and the Teeth themselves have a slight inclination inwards in the Jaws. The Molares, formerly termed Large Molares, are behind the Bicuspidati, are the largest of the Teeth, and have broad Bases with several points. The roots divaricate from each other, and have partitions of the Sockets between them, which assist in lessening the pressure

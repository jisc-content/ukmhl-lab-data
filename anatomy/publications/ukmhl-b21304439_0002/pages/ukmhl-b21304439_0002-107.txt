Part IV.] OF THE EAR. 95 The Branches of the Cochlea pass through the Cri- I briform Plates of the Modiolus, to the Pulpy Mem- lbrane lying on the Scalae. The Branches run between, and likewise on the out- side of the Partitions which divide the Cochlea into Gyri, and the Gyri into Scalae, and are large and nu- merous in proportion to the part they supply. The largest and most numerous of these Branches are i dispersed upon the Lamina Spiralis, where they form an intricate Plexus, the Threads of which are at first opaque, but are afterwards of the colour of the Retina of the Eye. The Branches terminate, and appear also to meet, upon that part of the Pulpy Membrane which is most distant from the Modiolus. • • Through the Cribriform Plate, common to the Mo- diolus and Infundibulum, the last Branches of this Por- tion of the Nerves pass to be spread out upon the Mem- brane lying within the Infundibulum.—For a particulai description of that part of the Porlio Mollis distributed to the Cochlea, and of the Cochlea itself see Du Mon- ro’s Treatise on the Ear* Of that part of the Portio Mollis destined for the Vestible fcnd Semicircular Canals, one Branch goes through the posterior Hole in the upper part of the Meatus Internus; the rest pass through the Holes in the under and back part of the Meatus, already point- / ed out in the description of that Passage. Having perforated the Foramina, the Nerves are seen first in distinct Plexus, after which they become transpa- rent, and are lost upon the Sac contained in the Ves- tible,

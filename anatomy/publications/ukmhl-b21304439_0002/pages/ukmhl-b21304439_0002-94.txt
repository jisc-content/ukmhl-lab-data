82 OF THE VISCERA, &c. [Part IV assists in communicating Sound to the Labyrinth. The two Foramina are placed opposite to the Membrana Tympani. The Sides or Walls of the Tympanum, which like- wise assist in conveying Sound to the Labyrinth, are lined with Periosteum, which is reflected into the diffe- rent Passages leading from it. The Cavity of the Tympanum contains four small Bones called Ossicula Auditus, which form a Chain, stretching across from the Membrana Tympani to the Labyrinth. The Ossicula Auditus are,—the Malleus, the Incus, the Os Orbiculare, and the Stapes,—these names being derived from Substances which they are supposed to re- semble in shape. The Malleus, or Hammer, consists of a round Plead, a small Neck, a.Manubrium or Handle, and two small Processes; one in the Neck, long and very slender, and therefore called Gracilis; the other in the upper end of the Handle, called Processus Brevis. The Handle is by some Authors considered as one of the Processes, and is then called the longest of the three. It forms an Angle with the Neck, is slightly compressed, becomes gradually smaller, and is bent at its extremity towards the Membrana Tympani. In the natural situation, the Head is turned upwards and inwards, and the Handle down upon the Membrana Tympani, to which it adheres. The Incus, compared in shape to an Anvil, but more resembling one of the Dentes Molares, with its roots widely separated, is situated behind the Malleus, and is formed

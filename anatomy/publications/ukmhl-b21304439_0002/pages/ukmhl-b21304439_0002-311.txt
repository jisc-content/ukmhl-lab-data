The Stomach is of a rounder form than in the Adult, and commonly contains a small quantity of Gelatinous Matter. The Plicae on the inner side of the Intestines are only beginning to appear. The Appendix Vermiformis is larger in proportion, and is inserted into the extremity of the Colon, which at this time does not project to form a proper Caecum. The Colon, and frequently also the end of the Ilium, are filled with a greenish-black Fceces, of a viscid consist- ence, termed Meconium, which is considered to be a mix- ture of the Bile with the Secretions from the Intestines. The Liver is so large as to occupy both Hypochon- driac Regions. The Umbilical Vein passes from the Umbilicus, in a Duplicature of the Peritoneum, to the left Branch of the Vena Portae, and carries the Blood from the Placenta to the Liver. From the Trunk of the Umbilical Vein, where it ter- minates in the Liver, a Branch, called Ductus xc 1 Cana- lis Venosus, runs in a somewhat waving direction, and joins the Left Vena Hepatica, where that Vein enters the Cava. The Ductus Venosus is much smaller than the Trunk of the Umbilical Vein, and carries part of the Blood of that Vein directly to the Heart, without allowing it to enter the Circulation in the Liver. rIhe Umbilical Vein sends Branches to the Right Lobe of the Liver, but is principally distributed through the Left Lobe, while the Right Branch of the Vena Portas

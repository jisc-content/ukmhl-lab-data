OF THE VISCERA, &c. [Part IV. 26 Inferior Cornua run downwards and forwards, and ter- minate in the Lateral Lobes of the Brain. In each of the Posterior Cornua there is an Elonga- tion, which terminates in a point, and which is called Ergot by the French, from its resemblance to the Spur of a Cock; or Hippocampus Minor, from its similarity to, and connection with, the Substance termed Hippo- campus Major. In the fore part of the bottom of the Lateral Ven- tricles, are two large Eminences, called Corpora Striata, which become gradually narrower, and recede from each other at their posterior extremities.- The Structure of these is Cineritious externally, and mixed with Medullary Striae within, some of which form large Transverse Medullary Arches, and others run more in a straight direction. Between the posterior parts of the Corpora Striata, are situated the Thalami Nervorum Opticonim, which have a roundish form and Medullary Surface, and are of a Striated appearance within; but the Striae are less distinct than in the Corpora Striata. Upon the Surface of these Bodies, there are small Eminences or Tubercles, some of which are placed upon their superior, and others upon their inferior extremi- ties. The inner parts of the Thalami are flat and conti- guous ; and above, they are so closely connected as to form one continued Surface, called Commisstira Mollis of the Optic Thalami. The posterior parts of the Thalami turn downwards and

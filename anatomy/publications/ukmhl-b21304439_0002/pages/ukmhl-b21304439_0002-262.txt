OF THE VISCERA, &c. [PartIV. ■254- The Tubuli Seminiferi in the Body of the Testicle consist of numberless extremely minute Ducts, which are of a Cylindrical form, have no division into Branches, and, when drawn out, are found to be several feet in Ingth. They are first collected into Bundles between the Sep- tula; of the Testicle, and these again into others still smaller, each of the smaller being formed of a simple Tube, coiled up into a Conical form, with its Base for- wards, and its Apex towards the posterior edge of the Testicle^ < From the convoluted Seminal Tubes, an equal num- ber of straight Vessels are sent out at the back part of the Testicle, under the name of Vasa Recta. At the upper and back part of the Testicle, the Vasa Recta communicate, and form an irregular Plexus or Net-work, called Rtte Vasculosum Testis. The Rete Testis sends out from twelve to eighteen straight Tubes, termed Vasa Efferentia, which carry the Semen from the Testicle to the Epididymis. The Vasa Efferentia soon become convoluted, and form Conical Bundles, termed Coni Vasculosi. The Coni Vasculosi are firmly connected by Cellular Substance, and are observed by Dr Monro, in his Treatise De Testibus, to compose somewhat more than a third part of the Epididymis. The Vascular Cones gradually unite into a single Tube, which constitutes the rest of the Epididymis, and though only about the size of a Hog’s Bristle, transmits the whole of the Semen. The single Tube becomes larger in its course and less convoluted,

OF THE EYE. TJ Part IV.J NER VES OF THE EYE. Besides the Optic Nerve, already taken notice of, the Eye receives the Third and Fourth Pairs, and Branches from the First of the Fifth Pair, together with the Sixth Pair, and Branches from the Seventh. The parts about the fore side of the Orbit are sup- plied by Branches from the Fifth and Seventh Pairs -, —the Ball of the Eye by Nerves called Ciliary, which come from the Third and Fifth Pairs;—the Fat, Mus- cles, Lacrymal Gland, &c. are supplied by the Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Pairs. The Eye receives and collects the rays of light, in such a manner as to form upon the Retina the image or picture of the object which the Eye looks at; and the point where these different rays meet is called the Focus. The object is painted upon the Retina in an inverted manner, the rays from above falling upon its under, and those from below upon its upper part; and it is suppos- ed to be by habit, or rather by instinct, that we judge of the real situation of any object. That the rays of light may terminate distinctly on the Retina, it is necessary that both the Cornea and Crystalline Lens should have a certain degree of con- vexity. If either the one or the other be too prominent, the Focus will be formed before it reach the Retina, as is the case in short-sighted people, who require concave ,E 4- glasses

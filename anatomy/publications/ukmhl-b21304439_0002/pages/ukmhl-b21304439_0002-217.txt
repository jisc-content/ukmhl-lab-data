Part IV.] OF THE ABDOMEN. 209 consist of Segments of Circles, which unite at different distances, so as to surround the Canal. The Longitudinal Fibres shorten, and the Circular contract the Intestines ; and upon the alternate relaxa- tion and contraction of these Fibres depends that Ver- micular motion called Peristaltic, by which the content* are pushed through the Canal. The Third, commonly called Nervous Coat, like that in the Stomach, is white and firm, and composed of Cellular Substance without Fat 5—its firmness giving strength to the Intestines. The Fourth, or Villous Coat, differs from that of the Stomach, in forming, with the Cellular Coat, numerous transverse Folds, termed Valvulce Conniventes, from their serving as a kind of Valves, to retard the motion of the Food. One edge of these Valves is fixed to the Intestine, the other is loose. They are much deeper than the Rugae of the Stomach, and placed opposite to the Interstices of each other, and are of different lengths, not forming entire Circles. The Villi of the Inner Coat are much more conspi- cuous than in the Stomach, being composed not only of the extremities of Arteries, Veins, and Nerves, but par- ticularly of the Mouths of Lacteal Vessels, the Origins of which are extremely small, and have a fungous ap- pearance. Numerous Ducts of Simple and Compound Glands ter- minate on this Coat, for the secretion of Mucus. The former are called Solitary, and the latter Con- V«l. II. O gregate;

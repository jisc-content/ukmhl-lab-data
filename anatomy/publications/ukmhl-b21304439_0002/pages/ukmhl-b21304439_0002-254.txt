246 OF THE VISCERA, kc. [Part IV. They like the inside of the Peritoneum, and, though thin, is so dense as to prevent the exudation of the Urine. This Coat is rendered somewhat unequal by the pro- jection of the Fasciculi of the Muscular Fibres ; and when the Bladder is empty, it forms large Wrinkles or Rugae. 'l'lie inside of the Bladder is very irritable, in conse- quence of which a desire to expel the Urine is occasion- ally excited. It is lined, however, by a Mucus dis- charged from its Arteries, which prevents it from being constantly irritated by that Fluid. The under part of the Bladder is perforated by three Openings; of which one is placed anteriorly, and two posteriorly. The anterior opening is the beginning of the Pas- sage called Urethra, and is surrounded by the Neck of the Bladder. It comes off almost at a right Angle from the lower part of the Bladder, without any tapering of that Vis- cus. The inner Lining of the Urethra at the posterior part of the Neck of the Bladder is frequently formed, in old people, into longitudinal folds. These, in the diseased state of the Prostate Gland, assist in the formation of the Lobes, which often project so much into the Cavity of the Bladder, as to have the effect of a Valve in clos- ing up the Orifice of the Urethra. The other two openings of the Bladder are formed by the terminations of the Ureters, which run obliquely forwards and inwards, between the Muscular and Inner Coat of the Bladder.

20 OF THE VISCERA, &c. [Part IV. III. The two Lateral Sinuses, which are formed by the Longitudinal and Torcular Sinuses. They run in depressions of the Occipital and Temporal Bones, first transversely, then in a winding direction downwards, and terminate at the Base of the Cranium, in the be- ginnings of the Internal Jugular Veins. Besides the Sinuses mentioned above, several others of less consideration will be pointed out in the particular description of the Veins. The Nerves of the Dura Mater are so very minute, that they have not as yet been distinctly traced; and it is found to possess very little sensibility in the sound state. Upon the side of the Superior Longitudinal Sinus, and parts of the Brain contiguous to it, there are nume- rous small Granulations^ of a whitish colour, called Gian- dulec Pacchioni. Besides these Granulations, there arc others of the same name, of a Fleshy colour, situated on certain parts of the outer Surface of the Dura Mater, and frequently projecting so much as to form deep Pits in the Skull. The nature of these Granulations is still unknown.â€” By some they have been supposed to belong to the Lym- phatic System. The Tunica Auachnoidea, named from its cobweb appearance, is an exceedingly thin, tender, and trans- parent Membrane, in which no Vessels have been hither- to observed. It is spread uniformly over the Surface of the Brain, inclosing

OF THE VISCERA, &c. [Part IV. 29S of the Blood. In its natural state, it has all the cha- racters of the Liquor Pericardii, or of the Liquors ex- hal d from the Surfaces of other Membranes similar to the Pericardium.—It is supposed to be derived from the Exlialent Arteries of the Amnios. It is proportionally greater in quantity in the first than in the last Months •, at the full time there are generally about a couple of pounds $ the proportion and quantity varying consideiably in different Women, and in the same Women in different Pregnancies. Between the Amnios and Chorion, Water is frequently collected, but in much smaller quantity than in the Am- nios, and is termed False Water, or False Delivery.—It is frequently discharged sometime previous to the Birth of the Child, without any danger. The Liquor Amnii defends the Child and Umbilical Vessels from the pressure of the Uterus, assists in dis- tending the Uterus during Gestation, and allows the Foetus a certain degree of motion ; but forms no part whatever of the nourishment of the Child, that being accomplished entirely by the Blood from the Umbilical Vein. Nor does it appear that any part of the Liquor Amnii is swallowed by the Child, as full-grown Foetuses have in different instances been born without a Mouth. In the time of Labour, it also assists in dilating the Mouth of the Uterus, and, by lubricating the Vagiiia3 facilitates Delivery. PECU-

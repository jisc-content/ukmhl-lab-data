Part IV.] OF THE THORAX. JG9 the Left Ventricle; the Right being united to the Left, al- most in the form of an Appendix. The Partition prevents any direct communication be- tween the two Ventricles. Opposite to the outer edge of the Septum, both upon the upper and under Surfaces of the Heart, there is a Groove in which some of the principal Trunks of the Coronary Vessels are situated. At the fore and right side of the Valvula Mitralis, and 1 behind the beginning of the Pulmonary Artery, there i is a Round Opening, which is the Mouth of the Aorta, and which is nearly of the same size with that of the Pulmonary Artery. Under this opening, the Surface of the Ventricle becomes smooth and equal, having none of the Co- i lumnae Carneas which arc seen on the other parts of its I Cavity. The Left Ventricle receives the Blood sent to it from, tthe Auricle, and, by a contraction similar to, but much .stronger than that of the Right Ventricle, propels it to ithe Aorta. , At the Mouth of the Aorta, there are three Semilu- nar Valves, with their Cojpuscula Aurantii, perfectly similar to those of the Pulmonary Artery,—but some- uvhat stronger. On the outside of the Semilunar Valves, are the Si- nuses of Valsalva, resembling those of the Pulmonary Artery,—but a little more prominent. The Semilunar Valves are pressed back by the Blood, the reflux of which they prevent during the contraction ef the Aorta.—They are returned towards the sides of

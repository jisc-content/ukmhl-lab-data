OF THE VISCERA, &c. [PartIV. ib the inferior part of the Antihelix, where there is a Fis- sure in the Cartilage. Action : To turn the tip of the Antitragus a little out- wards, and depress the extremity of the Antihelix. Transversus Auris, vel Transvcrsus Auricula:. Origin : From the prominent part of the Concha, on the back part of the Ear. Insertion : Into the outside of the Antihelix. Action: To draw the parts to which it is connected towards each other, and to stretch the Scapha and Concha. The Cartilage of the External Ear is connected to the Temporal Bone by the common Integuments, and by its Muscles *, and is furnished with Ligamentous Mem- branes, which fix it to the roots of the Zygoma and of the Mastoid Process. The Auricle collects sound, and conveys it to the Meatus Extcrnus,â€”the Muscles giving tension to it, so as to render the sound more distinct. The Meatus Anditorius Extcrnus leads inwards, from the Concha, and in its course proceeds somewhat for- wards and upwards, turning a little downwards at its farthest extremity, and terminating at the Membrana Tympani. The turns, however, are so inconsiderable, that the bottom of the passage can be readily seen in a clear light, upon pulling the Ear backwards. It is rather of an oval form, a little contracted in the middle.

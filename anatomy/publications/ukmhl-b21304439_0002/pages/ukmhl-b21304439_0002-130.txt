118 OF THE VISCERA, &c. [Part IV. The Nerves which supply the Teeth, though small, can be observed to enter the Foramina at the points of the Fangs, and by properly preparing the Teeth, can be distinctly traced in their Osseous Canals. The Absorbents of the Teeth have not been seen, but their existence is proved,—by the Absorption of the Fangs of the Temporary Teeth during the second Den- tition ;—the removal of part of the Teeth in conse- quence of ulceration within them; and the disappear- ing of part of the Internal Substance of the Teeth of such large Animals as the Elephant, where the Tusks have been found with extraneous Bodies forced into, and lodged within them. The Substance of the Osseous part of the Teeth is like that of Bone in other parts of the Body, differing only in being harder and more dense, in having its Fibres generally in a longitudinal direction, and in ha- ving a partial covering from the Enamel. The Teeth are fixed in their Sockets by Gomphosis, and attached to the Alveoli by a strong Periosteum. This Periosteum lines the Sockets, and is reflected upon the Fangs as far as the Necks of the Teeth, where it is intimately connected with the Gums. The Teeth serve to masticate the Aliment, to assist in pronouncing several of the Letters, and are orna- mental to the Face. Analysis I

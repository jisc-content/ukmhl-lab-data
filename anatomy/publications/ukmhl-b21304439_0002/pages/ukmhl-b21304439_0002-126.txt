114- OF THE VISCERA, &c. [PartIV, I The smaller Glands of the Mouth are in great num- bers, lying between the inner Lining of the Mouth and its Muscles, and deriving their names from their situa- tions. They arc much inferior in size to the former, each forming a simple little Lobe, which is somewhat flat- tened, or Lenticular. Each Gland sends out a Duct, which perforates the Skin of the Mouth, and opens into its Cavity. They consist ofâ€” The Buccales, whicli are dispersed over the whole of the Check, but most plentifully near the termination of the Parotid Duct j The Molares, which are in a Group, and are part of the Buccal, situated opposite to the large superior Dentes Molares; The Labialcs, lying on the inside of the Lips ; The Palatincc, upon the Palate ; and, The Linguales, at the root of the Tongue. The Arteries of the Salivary Glands are from diffe- rent Branches of the External Carotids. The Parotid Gland is supplied from the Temporal, the Inferior Maxillary Gland from the Facial, and the- Sublingual Gland from the Lingual Artery. The Veins of these Glands go to the External Jugu- lars. The Nerves are chiefly from the third part of the Fifth, and from the Portio Dura of the Seventh Pair. The Salivary Glands serve for the secretion of the Sa- liva, which they pour out in large quantity, and which is promoted by the motion of the Lower Jaw. The Sa- liva

Part IV.] ORGANS OF URINE. 2S7 posed of the original proper Coat and Cellular Sub- stance incorporated, which adheres closely to the Kid- ney, and is reflected over the edges of the Sinus, to be joined to the Pelvis and large Vessels. The Substance of the Kidney is commonly smooth and uniform, though sometimes it is irregular, in con- sequence of the Lobes which originally form it not be- ing completely incorporated. It consists of an outer part called Cortical, and an inner termed Medullary. The Cortical Substance, termed also Secerning, sur- rounds the Kidney, and forms about a third of its breadth. —It likewise sends in partitions which separate the Me- dullary parts from each other. The Medullary, termed also Uriniferous Substance, is of a paler colour than the former, and is divided into a number of distinct Columns, each of which terminates in a Projection called Papilla, or Processus Mcimmil- laris. The Papillce are merely the continuation of the Uri- iflferous part, though frequently considered as a third division of the Substance of the Kidney. Each Kidney has one, and sometimes more Arteries, which run transversely from the Aorta, and a Vein still larger than the Artery, which terminates in the Cava. —They enter at the Sinus of the Kidney, and are in- cluded in Cellular Substance, which accompanies them throughout their course. The Right Renal Artery is longer than the Left, in consequence of the Vena Cava, behind which it passes, being placed upon the right side of the Aorta. The Artery, as it approaches the Kidney, is divided , inta

F 2 Crura Part iV.] OF THE EAR. S3 formed of a Body and two Crura, one of which is term- ed the Short or Superior, and the other the Long or Inferior Crus. The Body has a Cavity and two Eminences, corre- sponding to the back part of the head of the Malleus, with which it is articulated. The short Crus extends backwards, and is joined by a Ligament to the edge of the Mastoid Opening. The long Crus, which is smaller than the other, is turned downwards, with'the point a little flattened, and bent inwards. The Os Orhiculare, or Lenticulare, is the smallest Bone of the Body, being considerably less than a grain of Mustard-seed. It is articulated with the point of the long Process of the Incus, and is so firmly fixed to it, that it has been frequently considered as a Process of that Bone. The Stapes is named from a striking resemblance it has to a Stirrup. It is divided into Head, Crura, and Base. The Head is placed upon a small flat Neck, and is ar- ticulated with the Os Orbiculare. The Crura, like those of the Incus, are unequal in length, and have each a Groove on the inside, which gives insertion to the Membrane stretched between them. The Base is of an oval, or rather semi-oval shape, and has no Perforation in it; its edges correspond with those of the Fenestra Ovalis, with which it is arti- culated. The Stapes is placed horizontally, being nearly at a right angle with the inferior Crus of the Incus. Its two

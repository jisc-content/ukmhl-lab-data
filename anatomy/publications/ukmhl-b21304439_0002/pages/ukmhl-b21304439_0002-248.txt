240 Or I HE VISCERA, &c. [pAnTlV, arises, termed Infundibulum or Cali:v, which receives the Urine from the Papillae. I he Infundibula are commonly the same in number with the Papillae; the number, however, varying in dif- ferent Subjects, two or more of the Papillae sometimes opening into the same Infundibulum. The infundibula join into two or three larger Trunks, at the Sinus ol the Kidney, which afterwards form a Dilatation of considerable size, of the shape of an in- verted Cone, and termed Pelvis of the Kidney. The Pelvis is placed partly within, but the greater part of it without the Body of the Kidney, and con- tracts into a long Tube, about the size of a writing-pen, called Ureter. The Ureters are commonly one to each Kidney, though in some rare instances they are double on one or on both sides. The Artery of the Kidney is placed uppermost,—the Vein in the middle and fore part,—and the Pelvis and beginning of the Ureter at the under and back part of the Blood vessels; which disposition of the Vessels serves as a distinguishing mark between the Right and Left Kidney, when separated from the Body. The Ureters descend in the Loins obliquely inwards behind the Peritoneum, and go over the Psoae and Iliac Vessels, opposite to the anterior and lateral part of the Os Sacrum. They pass afterwards into the Pelvis, and terminate in the under, outer, and back part of the Bladder. In their descent, they do not run in a straight, but in a waving direction, somewhat similar to the Italic /,-— neither

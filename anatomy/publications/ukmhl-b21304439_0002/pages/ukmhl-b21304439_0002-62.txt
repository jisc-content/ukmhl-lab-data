OF THE VISCERA, &c. [Part IV. 50 Tunica Membrane, termed Membrana Pupillaris, which gene- rally disappears between the seventh and ninth month of gestation. Upon the back part of the Iris, there is a dark-colour- ed Pigment or Varnish, considered by the Ancients as a posterior Layer of the Iris, and called by them Uveay from its resemblance in colour to the Grape. When the Paint is washed off, the Iris exhibits two sets of Fibres, concerning which Authors have enter- tained various opinions; one set in the form of Radii, the different colours of which give the diversity of colour to the Eye-, the other Circular, surrounding the inner edge of the Iris, and considered by Dr Monro as the Sphincter Muscle of the Pupil. The colour of the Iris corresponds in general with that of the Hair, being blue or grey where the Hair is light, and brown or black where the Hair and Com- plexion are of a dark colour. The Iris has also many Blood-vessels, which are ren- dered evident by Injection ; and is furnished with a greater proportion of Nerves than almost any other part of the Body. It floats in the Aqueous Humour, and is of such a nature, that upon exposure to a strong light, or when the Eye looks upon a near object, the diameter of the Pupil is diminished ; and vice versa. The different motions of the Iris are supposed to be excited by the sensibility of the Retina, and by the quantity of light which falls upon that Nerve. The Iris serves to regulate the quantity of light sent to the bottom of the Eye.

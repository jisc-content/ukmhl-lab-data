It approaches to a Circular Figure, but the Circle is frequently incomplete next the Orifice of the Urethra, or is of a Semilunar form, the broad part being turned towards the Perinceum. When the Flymen is ruptured, it degenerates into small Conical Papillae, termed Caruvailce Myrtiformes, from their supposed resemblance to Myrtle-berries. The Flymen has been considered as a test of Virgi- nity ;â€”but neither the presence nor the absence of this Membrane can be depended on as a certain criterion.

The Blood-vessels and Nerves of the External Parts are from the Pudic Branches, and are dispersed in nu- merous Ramifications upon the end of the Vagina, La- bia Externa, and Clitoris.

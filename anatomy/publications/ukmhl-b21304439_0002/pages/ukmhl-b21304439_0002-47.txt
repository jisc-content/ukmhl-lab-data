Part IV.] 55 OF THE BRAIN. from the Eminences^ called Testes to the posterior-infe- rior Notch of the Cerebellum. A little lower than the Testes, the Ventricle becomes wider, and forms an Angle behind, from which again it contracts, and becoming narrower and pointed below like a writing-pen, has got the name of Calamus Scrip- torius. Over the under end of the Aqumductus Sylvii, and upper part of the Fourth Ventricle, there is a thin Medullary Lamina, called Valvula, but properly Velum VIEUSSENII. At the sides of the Velum Vieussenii there are two . Medullary Tracts, called Processus ad Testes, or Colum- nce Valvidce Vieussenii. The under end of the Ventricle is found to be shut up by its Choroid Plexus, which prevents any communica- tion between this Cavity and that of the Spine. UNDER SURFACE OF THE BRAIN. Near the middle of the Base of the Brain, and be- tween its Lateral Lobes, there are two small, round, white Bodies, termed Eminentice Mammillares, or Cor- pora Albicantia, Medullary without, and Cineritious within, mistaken by some Authors for Glands. In the Corpora Albicantia, various Medullary Strata â€¢ terminate, which come from different parts of the Brain. Immediately before the Corpora Albicantia, is seen the Infundibulum, leading from the Third Ventricle. On the outside of the Corpora Albicantia, two large white Cord? are observed, called Cmra, or Peduncidi C 2 Cerebriy

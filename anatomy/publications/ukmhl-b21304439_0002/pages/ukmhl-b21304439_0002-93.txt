Part IV.] OF THE EAR. SI pressing too forcibly upon the different Membranes pla- ced in the sides of the Tympanum. It has been supposed to convey the sound of a Per- son’s own Voice to the Inner Ear ; but experiment does not favour this opinion, nor is it found to render Sound more distinct when the Mouth is open;—though Per- sons who have a degree of deafness are observed fre- quently to listen after this manner. The Cells of the Mastoid Process, which open into the upper and back part of the Tympanum, opposite to, but a little higher than, the Eustachian Tube. They are very irregular, and have many windings and turnings, which communicate with each other, and are lined, like the Cells of other Bones, with the Perios- teum Internum. They assist the Tympanum in reflecting Sound. In Quadrupeds which hear acutely, there are large Cavities, connected with the Tympanum, which seem to supply the place of Mastoid Cells. Above the Promontorv, a Hole called Fenestra Ova- lis, the upper and under edges of which are convex up- wards,—for lodging the Base of the Stapes. The long diameter of thisvFencstra is placed transversely, and near double the length of the short one. The inner edges of this Hole are contracted by a nar- row Border, upon which the end of the Stapes rests. Below the Fenestra Ovalis, and at the under and back part of the Promontory, a Hole, smaller than the for- mer, called Fenestra Rotunda. It is placed obliquely backwards and outwards, leads to the Cochlea, but is shut up by a Membrane which Von. II, F assists

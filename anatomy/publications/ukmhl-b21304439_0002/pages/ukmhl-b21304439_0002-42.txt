OF THE VISCERA, &c. [Part IV. 50 of the Choroid Plexuses of these Ventricles, below the anterior part of the Body of the Fornix, and over the fore part of the Third Ventricle, there is a Hole of an oval form, by which the Lateral Ventricles communicate freely with each other. See Monroâ€™s Obs. on Nerv. Syst. 1783, and Treatise on the Brain, 1797. After dividing hnd turning back the Fornix, another communication from the above passage is found, called Foramen Commune Anterius, Vulva, or Iter ad Infundi- bulum : but properly, Iter ad Tertium Ventriculum, or Passage to the Third Ventricle. Between the Commissura Mollis of the Optic Thala- mi and Substance called Pineal Glajid, there is a small Passage termed Anus, or Foramen Commune Posteriusy which has been supposed by some Authors to form a communication between the back part of the Third Ventricle and Lateral Ventricles ; but it is completely closed up by the Tela Choroidea, and also by the For- nix, which is intimately connected to this Membrane. The Third Ventricle is in form of a deep Fissure, placed between the inner ends of the Thalami Optici, having the Commissura Mollis of these Thalami situated above, the Crura Cerebri below, and the Bodies of the Thalami on each side. The Ini-undibulum, formed ofa Cineritious and Me- dullary Substance, is a Passage of considerable size, which leads downwards and forwards, from the anterior part of the Third Ventricle; gradually contracting, and becom- ing solid at its under end, where it terminates in the Glandula

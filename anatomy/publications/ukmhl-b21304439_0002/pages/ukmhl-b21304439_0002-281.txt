In the time of (Gestation they become effaced, by furnishing the Uterus with part of its external covering. The Ligamenta Rotunda are two long and slender (Cords, composed of Vessels and Ligamentous Fibres, ".arising from the Corners of the Uterus, immediately bbefore and below the Fallopian Tubes, from which they descend obliquely in the Ligamenta Lata, diminishing ii little in their course towards the Groins. They pass through the Rings of the Abdominal Mus- cles, in the same manner as the Spermatic Cords do in l.he Male, and are afterwards inserted by separate ranches into the upper and lateral parts of the Puden- lum, where they are insensibly lost. They assist the Ligamenta Lata in preserving the pquilibrium of the Uterus. The Ovaria, anciently called Testes Muliebres, are si- tuated at the sides of the Fundus Uteri, about an inch iistant from it, and are contained in the posterior Pi- iions of the Ligamenta Lata, which form a Coat to iem, similar to the Tunica Albuginea Testis. The Ovaria are plain above, and prominent and semi- wal below, flattened at their anterior and posterior lurfaces ; and the size of each, when in a state of the rreatest maturity, is nearly equal to that of half of the Hale Testicle. In the vigour of life, they are large, uniform, and mooth, but become small, unequal, and shrivelled, in | Id Women, and in those who have born many Chil- Vol. II. S dren.

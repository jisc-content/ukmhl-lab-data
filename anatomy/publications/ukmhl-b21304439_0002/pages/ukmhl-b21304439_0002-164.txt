The Pleurae adhere to the Periosteum of the Ribs, line the Intercostales and Sterno-costales, the Sternum, and Dorsal Vertebrae, and cover the Pericardium, Lungs, and Lateral or Fleshy parts of the Diaphragm. Behind the Sternum, the Pleurae are contiguous to each other, and form the Partition called Mediastinum, which extends between the Sternum and Vertebrae. The Arteries of the Pleura are from those of the ad- jacent parts, viz. from the Intercostal, Mammary, Dia- phragmatic, Bronchial, and Esophageal Arteries. The Veins, which return the Blood, accompany the Arteries, and are distinguished by the same name. The Nerves are from the Intercostals and Diaphrag- matics, but too small to be easily traced ; and the Mem- brane itself is not observed to possess much sensibility in the sound state. The Pleura, by its smoothness, facilitates the motions of the Heart and Lungs, divides the Thorax into Ca- vities, and strengthens its containing and contained parts. Mediastinum. The Mediastinum, so named from its situation in the middle of the Thorax, extends, as has been already ob- served, between the Sternum and Vertebras; but is in- tercepted

OF THE VISCERA, See. [PartIV. 272 Between the Rugae are many small Follicles, which discharge a Mucus for lubricating the parts near which they are placed :â€”Some of them, being of a roundish form, were mistaken by Naboth for Female Ovula. The under part of the Cervix projects into the Vagi- na, somewhat in form of the Gians Penis, and is per- forated by a transverse Slit, termed Os Internum Uteri; or, from the resemblance of this part to the Mouth of the Tench, Os Tinea;. The Os Tinea, in a Virgin Uterus, is about the size of the Orifice of the Urethra in the Male, but nearly twice as large in the Uterus of a Woman who has born Children. It is smooth on its external Surface, is placed ob- liquely, in a direction towards the back part of the Vagina, and is surrounded with several Mucous Fol- licles. The Appendages of the Uterus are, the Broad and Round Ligaments, the Ovaria, the Fallopian Tubes, and the Vagina. The Ligamenta Lata, termed sometimes Alec Vesper- tilionis, are two Membranous Productions or Doublings of the Peritoneum, sent from the edges of the Uterus and posterior extremity of the Vagina, to be fixed to the sides of the Pelvis. The Uterus and Ligamenta Lata separate the Pelvis into anterior and posterior Cavities, and arc themselves divided into large and small, or anterior and posterior Aim or Pinions. They contain and support the Ovaria and Uterine Tubes, with part of the Spermatic and Uterine Vessels and

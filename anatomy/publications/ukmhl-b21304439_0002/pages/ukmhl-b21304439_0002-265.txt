From each Vesicula Seminalis and Vas Deferens of tthe same side, a small Canal, about afinger’s-breudth in Jlength, passes out, which is firmly connected to its fel- llow, without communicating with it, and becomes gra- dually smaller, piercing obliquely the Prostate Gland, .land terminating in the under and bac k part of the Neck cof the Bladder, a little before the beginning of the Ure- tthra. The Orifices of these Canals sometimes open in a ILacuna, which is covered behind by a Valve, which bias its concave edge forwards; but more generally the are separated from each other by a Caruncula, or round IProjection of the Membrane of the Urethra, termed Weru-montanum, from its supposed resemblance to a Ja- .velin of the Ancients ;—or Caput Gallinaginis, from its Kieing broad behind, and rostriform before, and there- fore compared to the Head and Beak of the Woodcock. The Vesiculae Seminales are commonly considered as Reservoirs of the Semen, receiving it from the Vasa Oeferentia, and afterwards,—by a power inherent in hemselves, assisted by the action of the neighbouring Muscles, particularly of the Levatores Ani,—propelling tt into the Urethra. The Semen is prevented from passing into the Blad- der, the Opening from it being shut while that fluid is xpelled. Various Experiments have been made on the Vesicu- Vol. II. R he

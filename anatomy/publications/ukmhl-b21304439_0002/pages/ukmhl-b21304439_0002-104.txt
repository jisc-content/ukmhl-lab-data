OF THE VISCERA, &c. [Part IV. 92 lympanum in forming the Membrane of the Fenestra Rotunda, which is sometimes called Mcmbrana Tympa- ni Secundarii, from a resemblance to the Membrana Tympani, ancl from being also, like it, a little concave on the outer, and convex on the inner Surface, or where it faces the Scalae to which it belongs. Besides the Periosteum, the Vestiblc, Cochlea, and Semicircular Canals, contain a Pulpy Membrane, or there is a Membranous Labyrinth, upon which the Por- tio Mollis is irregularly dispersed. In the Vestiblc, the Pulpy Membrane forms a Sac, in shape resembling that of the Osseous Cavity which contains it, and which is described and beautifully deli- neated by Scarpa. When the Sac is laid open upon the upper and outer part, a Partition appears, partaking of the nature of the Sac, and termed by Dr Meckel Septum Vestilmli Ner* voso-Membranaceum. In the Cochlea, the Pulpy Membrane is in contact with the Periosteum, but can be separated from that Membrane without much difficulty. In the Semicircular Canals, it is at some distance from the Periosteum of these Bones, and is considerably smaller â– , but, like them, it forms distinct Tubes, which communicate with the Vestiblc. Like the Osseous, the Membranous Canals also form Ampullae, or Elliptic Ca- vities, at one end. The Arteries of the Labyrinth arise by one or two 'small Branches, chiefly from the Vertebral Artery, and pass through the Cribriform Plate, at the bottom ol the Meatus Interims which belongs to the Labyrinth.

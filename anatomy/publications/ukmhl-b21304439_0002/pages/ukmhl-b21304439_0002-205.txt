The ' Left is termed Cardia, or Os Ventricidi, or Upper Ori- )fice of the Stomach.—It is placed at the right side of ithe great Extremity, and is opposed to the Spine, but ;at a little distance from it, and is formed by the termi- mation of the Esophagus.—It allows a free passage for tthe Food into the Stomach, the return of which is pre- wented bv the Angle formed between the Stomach and lEsophagus, by the Fleshy parts of the Cardia, and by tthe Fleshy Crura of the Diaphragm, between which the (Cardia is situated. The Right or Inferior Orifice, commonly termed [Pylorus, is situated under the small Lobe of the Liver, :ia little to the Right Side of the Spine,—is turned rmore forwards than the Cardia, and is considerably Mower, but rises in proportion to the Distension of the SStomach. The Stomach is connected by the Cardia to the Eso- phagus,—by the Pylorus to the beginning of the Intes- tines,—by the Peritoneum and Blood-vessels to the SSpleen,—and by a reflection of the Peritoneum to the root of the Liver, and to the great Intestines.

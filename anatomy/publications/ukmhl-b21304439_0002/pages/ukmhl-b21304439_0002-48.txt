36 OF THE VISCERA, &c. [Part IV. * Cerebri, or Crura Anteriora Medulla Oblongata: t which arise from the Medullary Substance of the Brain, and gradually approach each other in their course, till they unite with the Tuber Annulare. Their Surface is flat, and composed of distinct Me- dullary Fibres. Internally they are composed of a mix- ture of Cineritious and Medullary Matter, the former of which being of a darker colour at one particular part than in any other of the Brain, has been termed Locus Niger Crurum Cerebri. Between the Crura Cerebri, and likewise between the Corpora Albicantia, there is a Cineritious Substance, called Pons Tarini, which joins these Bodies of the opposite sides together, and assists in forming the bot- tom of the Third Ventricle. From the Medullary part of the Cerebellum, which forms the Trunk of the Arbor Vitce, two white Cords arise under the name of Crura Cercbelli, or Crura Postc- riora, or Peduncidi Cerebelli, which unite w'ith the Crura Cerebri, to compose the Tuber Annulare, or Pons Va- rolii, so named from forming a Ring or Bridge over the Crura. This Ring is intimately incorporated with, and formed by, these Crura. The Tuber Annulare is situated over the back part of the Body of the Sphenoid and Cuneiform Process of the Occipital Bone. Many Transverse Streaks run on its Surface, and it is divided into two lateral parts by a longitudinal Depression, occasioned by the situation of the Vertebral Artery. At the fore and back parts of the Tuber, are the Fo- ramina idaeca> Anterius et Poslerius, the former placed between

Part IV.] OF THE MOUTH, &c. 143 The Superior Laryngeal Veins return to the Internal Jugulars j the Inferior to the Subclavians, or Superior Cava. The Nerves are chiefly the Superior and Inferior La- ryngeals, which are Branches of the Eighth Pair. The Larynx serves the purpose of Respiration, forms and modulates the Voice, and is also useful in Degluti- tion. It is the principal Organ of Voice ;—for, if a Hole be cut in the Trachea, of sufficient size to allow the Person to breathe freely through it, the power of pro- ducing Voice is destroyed till the cut is closed up. Voice is formed by the Air, in its passage through the Glottis, acting upon the Ligaments of the Glottis and Cartilages of the Larynx and Trachea, and thus producing a Tremor;—and is different in different Persons, according to the form and structure of the Larynx. The strength of Voice is in proportion to the quantity of Air expired, and the narrowness of the Glottis. A Tone is acute in proportion to the tension of the parts of the Larynx and Trachea in general, and of the Ligaments of the Glottis in particular. A Tone is grave in proportion to the reverse of the above. Speech is performed chiefly by the different parts of the Mouth, assisted by the Cavity of the Nose,—the Larynx moving only in a small degree. When the Air passes through the Larynx without producing a tremor, it occasions a Whisper. When

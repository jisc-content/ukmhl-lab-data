Ill Part IV.] OF THE MOUTH, &c. the Palate, and even the Pharynx and Esophagus, pos- sess the faculty of Taste in a certain degree. The principal Blood-vessels of the Tongue are large in proportion to the size of that Organ. They are called Linguales, vel Panina, on account of the dark-coloured Branches which appear under the Tongue. The Arteries, which are Branches of the External Carotids, are not found to communicate so freely on the opposite sides of the Tongue, as they do in other parts of the Body. The Veins open chiefly into the External Jugulars. The Nerves, like the Arteries, are large and nume- rous, and have little connection on the opposite sides. They come from the Fifth, Eighth, and Ninth Pairs. The first set supply the parts next the point of the Tongue, and are therefore considered as being princi- pally concerned in conveying the sensation of Taste. The second set supply the root, and the third the middle of the Tongue, and are chiefly dispersed upon its Muscles. There is a considerable intermixture, how- ever, between the three sets on the same side. Besides being the principal Organ of Taste, the Tongue is the chief instrument of Speech, and of the articulation of the Voice.—It also assists in Manduca- tion, Deglutition, Spitting, Sucking, &c. Salivary Glands. The Salivary Glands consist of three large Glands on each side of the Face, viz.—the Parotid, the Submaxil- lary,

OF THE VISCERA, &c. [Part IV- 194 $ The First, or External Coat, called also Peritoneal, is a Reflection of that part of the Peritoneum which comes from the root of the Liver. It strengthens the Stomach ; by its smoothness it di- minishes the effects of Friction ; and possessing few Nerves or Blood-vessels, it is not very susceptible of pain or inflammation. The Cellular Substance under the Peritoneal Cover- ing, is described by some Authors as a distinct Coat, called Tunica Cellulosa Puyschiana ;—but ought not to be numbered among the Coats of the Stomach. The Second, or Muscular Coat, is composed chiefly of two Planes of Fibres variously disposed. The External Plane is longitudinal, extends from the longitudinal Fibres of the Esophagus, and follows the same general course with that of the Stomach from the Great to the Small Extremity. Upon each side of the small Curvature, the longitu- dinal Fibres form a thick, strong, Muscular Band. The second Plane is chiefly transverse or circular, and considerably thicker and stronger than the other. Its Fibres are intersected by many small, white, Ten- dinous-like Lines ;—these, however, are in a great mea- sure formed of that Cellular Substance by which the two Coats are united. The Muscular Coat assists in the Digestion of the Food, by giving a gentle motion to the Stomach, ac- cording to the direction of its Fibres; the one set shortening it, the other rendering it narrower. The Pylorus is formed by a Doubling of the two inner Coats, which project into the Passage between the Stomach

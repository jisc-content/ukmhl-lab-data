180 OF THE VISCERA, &c. [Part IV The Cuspidati come next in order, and first those of the Under Jaw, which are soon followed by those of the Upper Jaw. About the end of the second Year, or a little later, the second, or posterior, or large Molares, appear, which complete the first Set; though to the above rule there are many exceptions. Of the Formation of the Permanent Teeth. The anterior Permanent Molares are first formed, the Fulps being found in the Foetus previous to its birth, and are situated in the back part of the Jaws. The Permanent Incisores and Cuspidati are formed on the inner side of the Temporary Incisores and Cus- pidati, in Capsules peculiar to themselves, but in the same Sockets with the Temporary Set. The Bicuspidati are formed at the roots of the Tem- porary Molares, small Osseous Partitions being found between the two Sets. At the time of birth, Ossification has commenced upon the anterior Permanent Molares j and there are sqaall Membranous Sacs containing a Pulp, with the Rudiments of all the other Molares. Ossification com- mences upon the tips some time after, but always first in the Under Jaw. By degrees, as the Alveoli increase in size, the Per- manent Teeth get Sockets of their own, as is seen b) removing the outer Alveolar Process in a Child of abou four years of age. At this period, the Ossification of the Incisores, Cus pidatus

Some Anatomists consider the greater part of the Corpus Spongiosum as merely a Plexus of convoluted Blood-vessels, particu- larly of Veins. The Urethra is a long Canid, the Diameter of which is nearly equal to that of a writing-pen. It begins at the under and fore part of the Bladder, runs through the Corpus Spongiosum, and terminates in the point of the Penis by a longitudinal Orifice. At its Origin it descends a little, and then passes for- wards under the Symphysis of the Ossa Pubis $ to which it is closely connected by Cellular Substance.—It then ascends at the outer and fore part of the Ossa Pubis ; varying in the remainder of its course, according to the different degrees of relaxation or distension of the Cells of the Penis. There are commonly three Dilatations in the Ure-i thra; one of which is at the Prostate Gland, the second in the Bulb of the Urethra, and the third about the be- ginning of the Gians. In general, it has also the same number of Slight Con-> tractions ^ the first at its Origin from the Bladder, the second between the point of the Prostate Gland and Bulb of the Urethra, and the third at the point of the Gians. Between the point of the Prostate Gland and part where the Urethra penetrates the Corpus Spongiosum*

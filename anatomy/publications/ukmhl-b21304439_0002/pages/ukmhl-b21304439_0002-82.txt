10 OF THE VISCERA, &c. [Part IV. Eye, and assisting it in the expression of certain Pas- sions, have been called Rotatores, and Amalorcs. VESSELS OF THE EYE. The Frontal, Facial, and Temporal Arteries, which are Branches of the External and Internal Carotids, supply the Palpebrae, and communicate with those which are dispersed within the Orbit. Some small Branches of the Internal Maxillary Ar- tery pass through the Inferior Orbitar Fissure, to be dispersed chiefly ypon the Periosteum of the Orbit and Fat of the Eye. The Ocular Arteiy, which is a Branch of the Internal Carotid, passes through the Foramen Opticum, in com- pany with the Optic Nerve, and supplies the Fat, Mus- cles, and Ball of the Eye, and also the Lacrymal Gland and Tunica Conjunctiva. The Branches which belong to the Ball of the Eye, have the name of Ciliares. They perforate the Sclero- tica in different places, and are afterwards dispersed upon the Choroid Coat and Iris. One Branch of the Ocular Artery, called Centralis Retina:, perforates the Optic Nerve, and is dispersed upon the Retina. The Veins which correspond with the Arteries of the Eye, communicate freely writh each other, and pass partly to the External Jugular Vein, by Branches si- tuated about the fore part of the Orbit, and partly to the Internal Jugular Vein, by the Cavernous Sinus.

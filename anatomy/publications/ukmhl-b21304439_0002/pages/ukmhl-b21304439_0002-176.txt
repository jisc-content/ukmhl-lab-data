OF THE VISCERA, &c. [Part IV. 16* of them are placed in the fore, and one in the back part of the Artery. Each of them forms a small Sac, one edge of which adheres to a third part of the circumference of the in- side of the Artery; the other edge is loose in the Cavi- ty of that Vessel, and is somewhat thicker and stronger than the rest of the Valve,â€”the thickened edges serving as Ligaments to it. The loose edge has a general Curve, divided into tivo smaller ones, which meet in a point at the middle. The Valves are chiefly formed of a doubling or ex- tension of the inner Coat of the Artery. In the middle point, or loose edge of each of the Valves, there is a small hard Triangular Granula, of a somewhat redder colour than the rest of the Valve, call- ed, from its reputed Discoverers, Corpusculum Auran- tii, vel Corpusculum Morgagni j or, from its resem- blance in shape to the Seed of the Sesamum, Corpuscu- lum Sesamoideum. The Corpuscles complete the Valves at the centre of the Artery, and enable them to make a stronger re- sistance against the Blood, while the Artery is in ac- tion. The Semilunar Valves are concave towards the Ar- tery, convex towards the Ventricle, and, when shut, their loose edges are opposed to each other, so as to enable them to form a complete Partition between the Ventricle and Artery. Opposite to the Semilunar Valves, the Artery bulges J out, and forms Three Projections, which have corre- sponding | /

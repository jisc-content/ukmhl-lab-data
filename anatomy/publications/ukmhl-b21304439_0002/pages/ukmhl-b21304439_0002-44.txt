The Testes are a little whiter in their colour than the Nates, and broader from one side to the other.

Over the Nates, and under the back part of the For- nix, is placed the Glandula Pinealis, which is of a Cineritious nature, about the size of a Garden-pea, and of a Conoid Figure ; obtaining its name from its resem- blance in shape to a Pine or Fir Cone.

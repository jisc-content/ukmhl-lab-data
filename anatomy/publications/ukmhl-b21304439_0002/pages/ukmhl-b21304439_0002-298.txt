290 OF THE VISCERA, &c. [Part IV, The generally after the Third Month, before the Tumour formed by it can be felt above the Symphysis Pubis. About this period it has acquired so much additional size and weight, that it is found lower than formerly in the Cavity of the Pelvis; in consequence of which, the Os Tincae is felt projecting nearer to the Os Externum Uteri. After this time, its bulk increasing, it presses against the Pelvis, and ascends in the Abdomen, carrying the Os Tincae higher than its original situation ; at the same time elongating the Vagina. In the fifth Month the Uterus renders the Abdomen tense, and forms a sort of Ball between the Pubis and Umbilicus. It continues to rise through the whole period of Ges- tation, and atter ascending above the Pelvis, it com- monly inclines, with its Fundus, forwards, and is fre- quently also turned a little to one side ; but the ascent is observed to be more in the first Gestations, and the inclination greater in later Gestations, owing to the na- ture of the Integuments of the Abdomen. In the seventh Month, it reaches the Umbilicus, and at last touches the Scrobiculus Cordis, Stomach, and Colon, being now about a foot in length from the upper to the under extremity; occupying the whole of the Umbilical and Epigastric Regions, and having the In- testines at the upper, lateral, and posterior parts of it. In the progress of Gestation, the whole Uterus be- comes softer, looser, and more Vascular, and the Ves- sels arc greatly enlarged ; the proportional increase be- ing nearly similar to that of the Uterus.

IPart IV.] OF THE ABDOMEN. 251 i rate kind, and of the same nature with the Salivary i Glands, of which it may be reckoned the largest. It is situated in the Epigastric Region, and is placed i transversely in the back part of the Abdomen, between the Stomach and Spine. It has a large or Right Extremity, and a small or Left one, an Anterior and Posterior Surface, and an Upper and Under Edge. The Right Extremity is attached to the left side of the second turn of the Duodenum, or to that part where the Intestine is about to go across the Spine. From the under part of the Right Extremity, the Pancreas sends down an Elongation or Process, which adheres closely to the Duodenum. This Process was discovered by Winslow, and term- ed by him Pancreas Minus.—It is also called Head of the Pancreas. The Body of the Pancreas passes before the upper edge of the transverse portion of the Duodenum, and over the Aorta, Vena Cava, and part of the Splenic Vessels, to all of which it is attached. It becomes gradually narrower and thinner towards its Left Extremity, which is rounded, and is fixed to the Spleen, through the medium of the large Omentum. The Pancreas is covered anteriorly by the two Layers of the root of the Meso-colon ;—posteriorly, it is only covered with Cellular Substance, which connects it to the Vertebrae. It is of a pale red colour, bordering upon yellow, and is composed of Acini, which form small Glands or Lobes, that are connected loosely by Cellular Substance, P 4 in

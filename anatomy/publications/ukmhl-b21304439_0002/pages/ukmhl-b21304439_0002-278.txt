The former consists of the Uterus and its Appendages. Internal Parts. The Uterus, Matrixy or Womb, is a hollow Viscus, situated in the Pelvis, in the Hypogastric Region, be- tween the Bladder and Rectum, with which it is con- nected. It is naturally placed in an oblique situation, with its under end directed a little forward •, but the obliquity must vary according to the state of the Bowels, with which it is in contact. It is of a Triangtdar Figure, and a little flattened be- fore and behind, but more so anteriorly *, is large above, small below, and has two angles at its upper and lateral parts, called Corners of the Uterus. It is distinguished into Fundus, or upper part, which includes the space above the insertion of the Fallopian Tubes, the Body or middle, and Cervix or under part; the two last being nearly of equal length. The extent and figure of the Uterus varies consi- derably in different Subjects.—In Women who have never been pregnant, it is commonly about two inches and a half in length, from one inch and a half to two inches in breadth at the Fundus, and about half as broad at the Cervix.—It is near an inch in thickness, and is larger in Women who have born Children, than in Virgins.

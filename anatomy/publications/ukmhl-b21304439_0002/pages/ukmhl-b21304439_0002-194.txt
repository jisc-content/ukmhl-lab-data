OF THE VISCERA, &c. [Part IV. ] $2 They are dispersed upon the Bronchi and Bronchial Glands, and the Substance of the Lungs in general, and are found to communicate with the Pulmonary Artery. The Bronchial Arteries are supposed to serve for the nourishment of the Lungs, and for the secretion of the Mucus. The Veins return the Blood to the Vena Azygos, and Left Superior Intercostal Vein. The Lymphatics form a Plexus upon the Surface of the Lungs :—They communicate freely with the deep- seated Absorbents, and pass through the Bronchial Glands. The Nerves of the Lungs are partly from the Great Sympathetics, but chiefly from the Eighth Pair, and are rather small in proportion to the bulk of the Organ on which they are dispersed. The Lungs serve the general purpose of Respiration, which consists of Inspiration and Expiration, or the passage of the Air into or out from the Lungs, by the alternate dilatation and contraption of the Thorax. Moderate Inspiration is performed in consequence of the Thorax being dilated by the action chiefly of the Diaphragm, assisted in a small degree by the Intercos- tales ; the Lungs, which are passive, and in contact with the Thorax, following it, and the Air rushing into the Trachea by its own gravity. In strong Inspirations, additional Muscles are brought into action, as the Scaleni, Serrati Postici Supcriores, Serrati Magni, and Pectorales Minores. Expiration is performed in consequence of a relaxa- tion of the Muscles which dilate the Thorax,—of the contraction 1 : t ci B V Ci i r~ r ra’ i; V, DO la *1 H si ci JCO m

Part IV.] ORGANS OF GENERATION. 249 Testicle singly, and forms a Septum between the two, which prevents Air or Water from passing readily from one side of the Scrotum to the other. The Vessels and Nerves of the Scrotum are chiefly from those of the neighbouring parts. The Blood-vessels are Branches of the Pudendal and Femoral. The Lymphatics go mostly to the Inguinal,â€”but some of them accompany those of the Testes to the Lumbar Glands. The anterior part of the Scrotum derives its Nerves from the Lumbar, and the posterior from the Pudendal and Sciatic Nerves. The Scrotum assists in supporting and protecting the. Testes. Under the Scrotum are two Membranes or Coats, pro- per to each of the Testes, the one termed Vaginalis, the other Albuginea. The Tunica Vaginalis, named from its forming a Sheath, is of the name nature with the Peritoneum, being originally a Process of that Membrane, which, in the Foetus, descends with the Testicle from the Ab- domen. It forms a shut Sac, which has no communication with any other part. It incloses the Testicle, as the Pericardium does the Heart, being only in contact with it, excepting behind, where it is continuous with the Albuginea. It is considerably larger than the Testis which it in- closes, reaching as far above and below it as to allow it a certain degree of motion. It

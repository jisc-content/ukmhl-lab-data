The Cavity of the Vestible contains no Air, but is i constantly filled with a Watery Fluid, called Aqua La~ byrinbhi, supposed to be secreted from the Arteries of the Periosteum, and which is found to resemble the Aqueous Humour of the Eye. The Aqueous Fluid fills the Vestible and SealÂ® of the Cochlea, and likewise surrounds the Membranous Se- micircular Canals. The Aqua Labyrinthi is considered as a medium by which sounds are communicated from the Membrane filling the round and oval Holes, and from the Base of the Stapes to the Pulpy Membrane placed in it. The superfluous part of the Aqua Labyrinthi is sup- posed by Cotunnius to be carried off by two small Co- nical Ducts, more particularly described by him than by some preceding Anatomists, who were partly ac- quainted with them, but considered them as Blood- vessels. One of the Aqueducts of Cotunnius, called Aquee- dactus Cochlea:, begins at the under part of the Scala Tympani, near the Fenestra Rotunda, and, after pass- ing through-the Pars Petrosa, is seen, in the Figures he givqs of it, terminating by a wide triangular Opening, upon the Surface of the Dura Mater, between the pas- sages of the Seventh and Eighth Pair of Nerves. The other Duct, called Aqiueductus Vestibuli, begins under the termination of the common Canal, in the Vestible, from which it descends, and terminates by a Triangular Opening between the Layers of the Dura Mater,

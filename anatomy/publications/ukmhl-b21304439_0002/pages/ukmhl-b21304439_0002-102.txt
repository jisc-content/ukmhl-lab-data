90 OF THE VISCERA, &c. [Part IV. trcmity joining with the internal one of the Vertical Ca- nal, by which a common Passage is formed. The Exterior is less than the other two, which are more of an equal size, is placed next the Tympanum, and has its extremities and curvatures nearly upon the same plane ;—with the convex part of the curve placed backwards. 0 Each of the Canals forms upwards of three-fourths of a Circle, can admit the head of a small Pin, and has a slight Dilatation, an Ampulla, or Cavitas Elliptica, at one end, the other extremity being nearly of the same size with the rest of the Canal. The Orifices are only five in number, two of the Ca- nals having a common termination. Of these Orifices, three are situated at the inside, and two at the outside of the Vestible, into the posterior part of which they open, without being closed by any Membrane. In the bottom of the Meatus Auditorius Intcrnus, which is situated in the posterior Surface of the Pars Petrosa, there is a large under, and a small upper Fos- sula, separated by a sharp Ridge. The fore part of the inferior Fossula leads towards the Cochlea, and is perforated with numberless minute Holes, through which branches of the Portio Mollis of the seventh Pair of Nerves pass to the Cochlea. One Hole in the Centre, larger than the rest, trans- mits a Branch of that Nerve to the Infundibulum. This Hole, however, is frequently enlarged, in consequence of the Bone, which is extremely thin, being broken ■while preparing it. In the back part of the inferior Fossula, three or four Cribriform

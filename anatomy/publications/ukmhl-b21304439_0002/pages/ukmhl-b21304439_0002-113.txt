OF THE NOSE. 101 Part IV.] Besides the Passages common to the Frontal Sinuses and anterior Ethmoid Cells, there are others proper to the posterior Ethmoid Cells, which terminate in the upper and back part of the Nose, near the openings of the Sphenoid Sinuses. The Sphenoid Sinuses, open, behind the Cells of the Ethmoid Bone, into the upper and back part of the Nose. - The Maxillary Sinuses open at their upper and inner sides, each by one, and sometimes by two Passages, into the middle of the space between the Superior anti Inferior Spongy Bones, nearly opposite to the under edge of the Orbit. At the upper part of the Maxillary Sinuses, Appen- dices, described by Haller, are sometimes found, which communicate with the Ethmoid Cells. The Sides, or Walls of the Maxillary Sinuses, are formed of thin Plates of Bone, excepting where the Pro- cesses project, and give them additional strength ; and below, the Bone is so thin between them and the Dentes Molares, that the roots of these Teeth are sometimes found to perforate the Septum. The different Sinuses are lined with a continuation of the Membrana Schneideriana; but in these it is much thinner, and less Vascular and Nervous, than that part of it which lines the general Cavity of the Nose. They are constantly moistened, but not filled with a Fluid. The Sinuses increase and modulate the voice : Their hollow structure renders the Bones lighter ; they sepa- G 3 , rate

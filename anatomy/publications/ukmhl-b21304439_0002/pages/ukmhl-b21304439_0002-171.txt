Part IV.] OF THE THORAX. 159 tween the Auricle and Ventricle, the other between the Ventricle and Artery. At the right side of the Heart are two Veins, called from their large size Vena Cava; the one Superior, the other Inferior. The Superior Vena Cava, called also Vena Cava De- scefidens, conveys the Blood from the upper parts of the Body â€¢, and the Inferior Vena Cava, termed likewise A- scendens, conveys it from the lower parts; and both ter- minate in the right Auricle. The Blood in the Auricle is prevented from returning by the fulness of the Veins, and by the pressure of the Blood a tcrgo. The Auricle is situated upon the right, and partly upon the back part of the Heart. It is somewhat of an oval form, and is divided into the Bight Sinus Venosus, and Proper Auricle. The Sinus Venosus is formed by the union of the two Venae Cavae, which swell out towards the anterior and left side. It is notched at its anterior edge, is a Mus- cular Bag of considerable strength, and both upon its outer and inner Surface is uniform and smooth. At the upper and left side of the Sinus, is the Pro- jection or Appendix, termed, from its supposed resem- blance to the Ear of a Quadruped, Proper Auricle. It is formed by a blind Sac, which is serrated and notched on its posterior edge, and convex or rounded on the other, and terminates obliquely in an obtuse point. The Sinus and Proper Auricle form one common Ca- vity, have no valve between them, and are therefore filled and emptied at the same time. Where the two Cavm meet in the Hearts of Quadru- peds,

Part IV.] ORGANS OF URINE. 239 wards in the Thoracic Duct.—The Superficial Lympha- tics are so small as seldom to be seen, excepting in the diseased state of the Kidney. The Nerves are from the Semilunar Ganglion formed by the Great Sympathetic and Eighth Pair. They com- pose a Plexus which surrounds the Blood-vessels, and accompanies them in the Kidney. From the minute extremities of the Renal Artery, in the Corpuscles seated in the Cortical Substance, the Uri- niferous Tubes arise. They are mixed with some ex- tremely small Blood-vessels, and constitute the Medul- lary Substance of the Kidney. By degrees they unite into larger Tubes, which run in a radiated manner, the direction being from the outer edge or circumference, towards the Sinus or inner part of the Kidney. The Radiated Tubes, becoming still larger in their passage, terminate in the Papillae, which are of a com- pressed Conical form, and at a little distance from each other. f The Papillae are twelve or more in each Kidney, the number varying according to that of the Original Lobes of which the Kidney is composed, and likewise from some of the Papillae being incorporated with each other. Upon the Points of the Papillae are the Terminations of the Uriniferous Tubes,—large enough to be distin- guished by the naked Eye,—through which the Urine distils from the Substance of the Kidney. Round the root of each Papilla, a Membranous Tube arises*

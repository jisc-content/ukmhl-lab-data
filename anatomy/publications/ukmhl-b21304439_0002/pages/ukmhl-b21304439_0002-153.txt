Part IV.] OF THE MOUTH, &c. 141 They drawn down by the Tongue and by small Muscles, it defends the Glottis, and shuts it completely in the time ; of Swallowing. After the action of Swallowing, it is i raised by its own elasticity, and by the root of the Tongue, to which it is fixed; returning to its former position. Ligamenta Thyreo-Arytenoidea, or Ligaments of the Glottis.—From the fore part of the Body of each of the Arytenoid Cartilages, a Ligamentous Cord passes horizontally forwards, to be fixed by its other extremity, at the side of its fellow, to the inner Surface of the an- terior Angle of the Thyroid Cartilage. The Opening formed between these Ligaments is call- ed Glottis, Mouth of the Larynx, and Lima Glottidis, and is of a triangular figure, the Ligaments being in contact before, but at a considerable distance from each other at their posterior extremities. • Under these two Ligaments there are two others, larger and more distinct than the former, and which are commonly considered as the Vocal Ligaments, or the proper Ligaments of the Glottis. They arise from the Base of the Arytenoid Cartilages, and run in the same direction with the former, to be fixed also to the Thy- roid Cartilage. In the Interstice of the Superior and Inferior Liga- ments, on each side there is a Fissure, which leads to a small semicircular Membranous Cavity or Depression, with its bottom turned outwards. These are the Ventricles of the Larynx of Galen.— They are chiefly formed by the inner Membrane of the Larynx.

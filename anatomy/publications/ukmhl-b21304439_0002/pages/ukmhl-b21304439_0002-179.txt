167 Part IV.]. OF THE THORAX. L 4 The opposite to a Groove seen externally between the Auricle and Ventricle, similar to that on the right side. The Left Auricle receives the Flood from the Pulmo- nary Veins, and, by its Muscular contraction, drives it into the Left Ventricle, from which it is prevented from returning, by a Valve in the Ventricle, called Mitralis. The Left Ventricle is situated in the posterior and left part of the Heart, and is somewhat of an egg shape. Its sides are about three times thicker and stronger than those of the Right Ventricle ; the thickness being in proportion to the force required to propel the Blood to the most remote parts of the Body. It is narrower and rounder, but considerably longei'y both on its External Surface and in its Internal Cavity, than the right Ventricle, and generally descends some way below the other, and forms the Apex Cordis. The Cavity is commonly described as being less than that of the Right Ventricle;—but the apparent diffe- rence, which takes place after death, is accounted for with seeming propriety by some Authors,—from the Left Ventricle being then for the most part found empty, and the Right one full, and from the greater degree of contractility in the former. That the capacity of the Cavities of the right and left sides of the Heart, is more nearly equal during life than after death, or than it is generally supposed to be, is evident from the appearance of the Heart of the Hu- man and also of the Brute kind, and from Injections thrown into the two sides of the Heart, where the force applied is ip proportion to the relative strength of each ride.

I(i6 OF THE VISCERA, &c. [Part IV. Of the Pulmonary Veins, Two come from the right, and Two from the left Lung, and terminate in the cor- responding sides of the Left Auricle, towards its upper part. The Left Auricle is considerably thicker and stronger than the Right, and is also divided into Sinus Venosus and Proper Auricle, which form one common Cavity without the intervention of any Valve. The Left Sinus Venosus, called also Sinus Pulmonalis, is turned towards the Spino, is more of a cubic form than the Right one, but resembles it in the uniformity and smoothness of its outer and inner Surfaces. From the fore and left part of the Sinus, the Proper Auricle projects, and forms a distinct flat Appendix or Bag, with different. Curvatures or Indentations upon its edges. The inner part of the Proper Auricle is longer, but narrower than that on the right side ; like it, however, it is formed of Columnae, with Furrows between them. The Proper Auricle is somewhat less capacious than that on the right side; but the Sinus is as much larger as to render the two common Cavities of the right and left Auricles nearly equal. The two Auricles have a Fleshy Septum between them, in which, as has been already mentioned, there is the Foramen Ovale in the Foetus;â€”but in the Adult the Partition is generally perfect, leaving merely the vestige of the Valve which belonged to this Passage. From the under part of the Sinus Venosus, a Passage leads down to the Cavity of the Left Ventricle, and is opposite

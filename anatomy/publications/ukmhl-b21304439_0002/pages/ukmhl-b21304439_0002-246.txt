OF THE VISCERA, &c. [Part IV. into Branches, which are afterwards minutely distribut- ed through the Cortical Substance, forming Arches and Anastomoses ; but these are found to be much less fre- quent than are commonly described ; for a fine Injection thrown into a Branch of the Artery, fills only the ra- mifications belonging to that Branch. The small Branches, after turning and winding in various directions, pass partly towards the Surface of the Kidney, where they form irregular Stars, some of which supply the proper Membrane. Others turn inwards in a waving direction, and form Corpuscles, disposed somewhat after the manner of Clus- ters of small Berries, which can only be seen distinctly by the assistance of Glasses, after a minute Injection. The Corjruscles were considered by Dr Nichols as - the Globular Terminations of Blood-vessels, and termed by him Globuli Artcriarum Termini,• but these Globuli were afterwards observed by Mr Hewson, and others, to consist of small Vessels intimately intermixed. The Veins returning from the extremities of the Arte- ries, unite in the Cortical Substance ot the Kidney. The Branches of the Renal Vein are much larger than those of the Artery; they communicate freely, especially on the Surface of the Kidney, but correspond with them in their course.—They form a large Trunk on each side, which lies anterior to the corresponding Artery, and runs transversely to the Cava; the left, which is the longer of the two, passing across the fore part of the Aorta. The Lymphatics of the Kidney run from without in- wards, and terminate in the Lumbar Glands, and after- wards

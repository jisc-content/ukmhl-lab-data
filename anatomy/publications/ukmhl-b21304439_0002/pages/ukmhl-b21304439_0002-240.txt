OF THE VISCERA, &c. [Part IV, 232 in such a manner as to give an appearance of uniformity and smoothness to the External Surface. By a good Injection, each of the Acini is found to be composed of an assemblage of Blood-vessels, and of the origins of an Excretory 'l ube. The Arteries of the Pancreas are derived, partly from the Hepatic, but chiefly from the Splenic, by several small Branches, which pass at various places into its Substance, in a transverse direction. The Veins correspond in name and course with the Arteries, and assist in forming the Vena Portae. The Lymphatics run to the Splenic Plexus, and ter- minate in the Thoracic Duct. The Nerves of the Pancreas are small. Like those of the other Viscera of the Abdomen, they arc derived from the Great Sympathetic and Eighth Pair. From the different Acini of the Pancreas, small Ducts ari e, which join into larger ones, running transversely in the Substance of the Pancreas, and forming a com- mon Duct, called Ductus Pancreaticus. The Pancreatic Duct, termed also Ductus Wirtsitn<5-1, after the Discoverer of it in the Human Body, is remark- ably thin, of a white colour, and semi-transparent. It begins at the Left Extremity of the Pancreas, runs somewhat Serpentine in the Substance of the Gland, a little below its middle height, becoming gradually larger in consequence of receiving the different Branches which compose it,—and is at last about the size of a Haven’s Quill. At the Right Extremity of the Pancreas, it receives the principal Duct of the Pancreas Minus, and termi- nates

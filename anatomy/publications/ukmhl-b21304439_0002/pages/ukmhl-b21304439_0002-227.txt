Part IV.] OF THE ABDOMEN. 219 The Liver is connected to the Body by different Pro- cesses, termed its Ligaments; all of which, excepting one, are formed by Doublings of the Peritoneum, viz. The Ligamentum Latum, or Suspensorium ILepatis, placed between the Right and Left Lobes above, and extending below into the Fossa Umbilicalis. It is fixed obliquely to the Diaphragm and tip of the Ensiform Cartilage, and then descends in the same ob- lique direction, adhering to the inner part of the Vagina of the Right Rectus Abdominis, as far as the Umbi- licus. The Ligamentum Rotundum, which was the Umbilical Vein in the Foetus, placed in a Doubling at the under part of the Ligamentum Latum, and fixed to the Um- bilicus. These two Ligaments have been supposed to resemble a Falx, with the edge turned uppermost, from which circumstance the Ligamentum Latum is sometimes also called Falciforme. The Ligamentum Dextrum, or Right Lateral IJga- ment, which is short, and connects the back part of the right extremity of the Great Lobe to the Diaphragm. The Ligamentum Sinistrum, or Left Lateral Liga- ment, which is longer than the former, and connects the left extremity of the Small Lobe to the Diaphragm. The Ligamentum Coronarium, considered by some as merely Cellular Substance, and by others as a Reflection of the Peritoneum, or both.â€”It unites the root of the Liver to the Tendinous Portion of the Diaphragm. Besides the Ligaments already mentioned, two others are described by Haller ; one called ILepatico-Colicum, which

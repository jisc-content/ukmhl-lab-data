OP THE VISCERA, &c. [Part IV. 120 appear broader than when examined in their anterior and posterior Surfaces. Each of these Teeth has a single Fang. Their Enamel is thicker on their anterior and poste- rior Surfaces than at the sides, where it is remarkably thin, and thicker before than on the back part of the Tooth. The middle Incisores of the Upper Jaw are the broadest of the Incisores, w'hile the lateral Incisores of the Under Jaw are larger than the middle ones. The Cuspidati, or Canine Teeth, are placed at tho sides of the Incisores, and, like them, have their Bases in form of Wedges, but pointed in the middle. The Enamel covers more of these Teeth than of the Incisores, and is more equal in thickness all round the Teeth. The Fangs are thicker, larger, and more depressed at the sides, than those of the Incisores, and appear broadest when viewed in a lateral direction. The Fangs being the largest of any of the Teeth, project more in the Jaw, as is obvious both to the sight and touch; hence the Incisores and Canini are almost in a straight line, especially in the Under Jaw. They have each commonly but one long root, though in some rare cases two, and are crooked at the point. They re- semble the Tusks of Carnivorous Quadrupeds, especial- ly those of the Dog tribe, from which they have got their name. The tw'o of the Upper Jaw are a little larger and longer, and have their roots more crooked than those of the under one. In

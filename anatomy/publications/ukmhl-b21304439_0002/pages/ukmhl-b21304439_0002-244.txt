It is a little broader behind than before, and a little broader and more curved above than below ; from v hich circumstances, but more particularly from the disposi- tion of the Vessels, to be afterwards mentioned, it is easy to distinguish the Right from the Left Kidney when taken out of the Body. The Right Kidney is connected to the Liver and Duodenum, the Left to the Spleen, and both to the Muscles on which they are placed, and to the Renal Glands and Colon, by Cellular Substance, and by the Peritoneum. They are also connected to the Aorta and Vena Cava by their Blood-vessels, and to the Bladder of Urine by the Ureters.—They accompany the motions of the Liver and Spleen, in the different states of Re- spiration. Each Kidney is surrounded by loose Cellular Sub- stance, which commonly contains a considerable quan- tity of Fat, from which it is termed Tienica Adiposa.

Around the Nipple, there is a Circle or Disk, called Areola,—nearly of the same colour with that of the Nipple itself. The colour here, however, varies at different times of life,—being florid in Girls, of a pale brown in Wo- men more advanced in life, and in old age of a livid and dull colour. During Pregnancy, it is of a darker colour than at other times, in consequence of a change which takes place in the Corpus Mucosum which forms it. Under the Skin of the Areola, there are numerous Sebaceous Glands, or Follicles, the Orifices of which dis- charge an oily Mucus, to defend the Nipple and Areola around it. The Arteries of the Mamma are partly from the In- ternal, and partly from the External Mammaries; the former of which are sent off from the Subclavian, and the latter from the Axillary Artery ;—the Branches en- tering the Mamma at many different places. The Veins accompany the Arteries, and are distin- guished by the same name. The Absorbents, like the Blood-vessels of the Mamma, are numerous. The greater part of them pass through the Axillary Glands; others penetrate the Interstices of the Ribs, near the Sternum, and enter the Glands which belong to the Internal Mammary Vessels. The Nerves are chiefly from the Axillary Plexus, a few Branches being also sent off from the Intercostals. From the extremities of the Arteries in the Substance of

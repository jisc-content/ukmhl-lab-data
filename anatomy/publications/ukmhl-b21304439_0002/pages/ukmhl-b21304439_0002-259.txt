Part IV.] ORGANS OF GENERATION. 251 and this part of it being large and of a round form, is termed Globus Major, or Head of the Epididymis. In its descent, it becomes somewhat smaller and flat- ter, and is attached behind to the Body of the Testicle where the Blood-vessels enter â€¢, but it is loose at its fore part, the Tunica Albuginea dipping in this place, and forming a Cavity or Pouch between it and the Testicle. The under part of it becomes more firmly attached to the Body of the Testicle, and forms the Cauda, or Glo- bus Minor. It is then turned backwards upon itself, after which it sends out the Excretory Duct of the Tes- ticle. The Body of theTestis has numerous Arteries, Veins, Absorbents, and Nerves but is principally composed of a collection of minute, tender, elastic Filaments, intri- cately convoluted, termed Tubuli Seminiferi, or Vasa Seminalia. The Tubidi Seminiferi are disposed in Fasciculi or Bundles, between Partitions, which are formed of Blood-vessels and Cellular Substance. These Septulje begin at the root or Nucleus, some- times termed Corjms Highmorianum, situated at the back part of the Testicle, and extend in a radiated manner to the Tunica Albuginea. The Testis is fixed behind by its Vessels, which are collected into a Cord termed Spermatic, but is loose and free before, to prevent it from being pinched. 1 he Spermatic Cord, properly so called, extends from the Ring of the Obliquus Externus to the Body of the Testis, and is composed of the Trunks of the different Vessels belonging to it, and of a quantity of Cellular Substance.

296 OF THE VISCERA, See. [PaiitIV. The Placenta is connected to the Uterus on one side by Blood-vessels and by the Decidua, and to the Foetus on the other, by means of the Umbilical Cord. The common place of attachment is near the Fundus Uteri; though it is found at different times adhering to all the other parts of the Uterus, not even the Os Tincae excepted. In the case of Twins, there is sometimes only one, but most frequently two distinct Placentae, adhering to- gether by the intervention of a Membrane in which the Vessels of the two Placentae occasionally communicate with each other. There are in this case also two distinct Apartments, separated by a Partition ; each Apartment containing its own Waters and Cord. The Placenta receives Blood from the Uterus, and, according to the opinion of modern Anatomists, puri- fies the Blood, as the Lungs do in the Adult, for the nourishment of the Foetus. The Membranes consist of the Spongy Chorion, the True Chorion, and the Amnios. They form a complete but slender Bag, which lines the Cavity of the Uterus, and incloses the Foetus, Um- bilical Cord, and Waters. The Spongy Chorion is a thick opake Substance, which adheres to the Uterus, and forms the outer Layer of the Ovum, but scarcely penetrates between the Lo- bules of the Placenta, though, in the early Months, it enters more into the composition of that Substance. Between the Uterus and Placenta, it is Jess distinct than elsewhere, being perforated there, and in some de- gree

The third Coat is termed Nervous, and is considered by some as a continuation of the Cutis Vera, but is properly Cellular, being formed of loose Cellular Sub- stance, which connects the Muscular to the inner Coat. The Inner Coat is continued from the lining of the Mouth : It consists of many longitudinal Plica:, which are scarcely visible when the Esophagus is dilated, and is furnished with numerous Foramina, which discharge a Mucus, for lubricating the Passage, and facilitating Deglutition. The Arteries of the Esophagus are Branches of the Inferior Laryngeals, which supply the Cervical part of it, and the Esophageals and Branches of the Bronchials, which are derived from the Aorta Descendens, and sup- ply the Thoracic Portion. The Veins go to the Inferior Laryngeals, to the Vena Azygos, and to the left superior Intercostal Vein. The Absorbents are numerous, and intermix with thqse of the Heart and Lungs. The Nerves are chiefly from the Eighth Pair. The Esophagus receives the Aliments from the Pha- rynx, and conveys them to the Stomach. TnoRAcrc Duct. The 1 iioracic Duct is a small Membranous-like Canal, situated in the back part of the Thorax, and is the principal Trunk of the Absorbent System. It begins upon the third Vertebra of the Loins, and passes

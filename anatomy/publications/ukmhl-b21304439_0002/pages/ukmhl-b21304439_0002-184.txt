172 OF THE VISCERA, &c. [Part IV.. The rnl:—The Veins, by a slow and equal motion, and with- out Pulsation, return the Blood, from all the different parts of the Body, to the Auricles, which, on account of the quantity and stimulating quality of the Blood, contract suddenly and at the same time, and send it to the Ventricles. The Ventricles, from the same cause which stimulates the Auricles, and from the stroke they receive from them, contract convulsively, with a force proportioned to the thickness of their sides, and send the Blood to the Arteries; and, during their Contraction, they are thrown by the dilating Auricles against the Ribs, where the stroke occasioned by the Pulse of the Heart may be felt. The Arteries, by their contractile power and elasti- city, send the Blood suddenly to the Veins, through which, by the united force of the Ventricles and Arte- ries, and likewise, as some suppose, by a contractile power of the Veins, and pressure of the surrounding parts, it is driven again to the Auricles. In its course, the Blood performs a double Circula- tion,—one called the Lesser, the Pulmonary, or that through the Lungs,—the other called the Greater, the Aortic, or that through the rest of the Body. In the former, it passes from the Right Ventricle to the Lungs, and returns to the Left Auricle.—In the lat- ter, it goes from the Left Ventricle to the different parts of the Body, and returns to the Right Auricle. During this Circulation, the Auricles and Arteries, and the Ventricles and Veins, act in concert, contracting and dilating at the same time.

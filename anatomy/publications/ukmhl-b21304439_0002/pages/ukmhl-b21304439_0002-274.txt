266 OF THE VISCER A, &c. [Part IV. with their fellows on the opposite side, and terminate partly in the corresponding Veins, and partly in the Colls of the Penis. The Veins arise, some from the extremities of the Ar- teries, and others by large open Mouths from the Cells of the Penis. 'Flic greater number of the Veins unite into a Trunk, called Vena Magna Penis, which runs in the superior Groove formed by the union of the Corpora Caverno- sa, and is furnished with Valves, and with thick strong Coats. The Vena Magna, at the under end of the Symphysis Pubis, separates into Right and Left Plexus, which pass to the corresponding Iliac Veins. To an obstruction of the course of the Blood through the Veins, by the pressure of the Muscles at the root of the Penis, together with an increased influx through the Arteries, is owing that accumulation of Blood in the Corpora Cavernosa and Corpus Spongiosum, which occasions a distension of the Penis. The relaxation of the Penis happens from the causes which produced the distension being removed; the elas- tic Ligamentous Membrane which covers the Penis a- gain forcing the Blood from the Cells into the Veins. Upon the Surface of the Penis, there are small super- ficial Veins, which communicate with those deeper seat- ed, and commonly terminate by one or more Branches in the Veins at the top of the Thighs. â€¢ These Branches assist in carrying on the circulation, and return part of the Blood during the distension of the Penis.

They are commonly upwards of a hand-breadth in llength, and contained in a Doubling of the Ligamenta ILata.—In their natural situation, they lie near the Ova- Iiria; but when drawn out and extended, are a finger’s- Ibreadth distant from them. The Structure of the Tubes is nearly the same with ♦that of the Uterus, and, like it, they are capable of di- latation and contraction : Their inner side, however, lhas a different appearance, being furnished with many 1'small longitudinal Plicae, which have a Muscular ap- jpearance, and which are most conspicuous towards the (outer extremities. They have a very large proportion (Of Blood-vessels, which run between their outer and iinner Membranes.

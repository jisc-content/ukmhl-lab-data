4 OF THE VISCERA, &c. [Part IV. The the Perspirable Matter; and this Matter, when increas- ed in quantity, is considered by most of the modern Physiologists as forming the Sweat. It is perforated also by the ends of the Excretory Ducts, which are found only in particular parts of the Skin j by the be- ginning of the Absorbents, which take in certain Sub- stances applied to the Surface of the Skin; and by the different hairs. The Perforations, or Pores, are most evident upon the Palms and Soles, and upon the Nose, Ears, and external parts of Generation. The Cuticle covers the Skin through its whole extent, excepting under the Nails. From the external Surface of the Body, it is reflect- ed inwards, to line the large passages; as the Nose, Mouth, Alimentary Canal, the Trachea, Urethra, Va- gina, &c. In these Passages, however, the Cuticle becomes less uniform in its texture ; and in some of them, as in the Stomach, it is either wanting, or is so much changed in structure, as to have the appearance of being so. From the Surface of the Cuticle, certain Processes are sent into the Skin, which line the passages by which the Cutis is perforated. Many opinions have been advanced concerning the Origin of the Cuticle. The latest and most probable is, that it is formed by a condensation of the Corpus Mu- cosum, or by the extremities of Excretory Vessels ;â€” its density, however, is such, that no Vessels can be traced in it, cither by the eye, or by the assistance of glasses.

The Seventh Pair arise from the beginning of the la- teral parts of the Medulla Oblongata, and are divided on each side into a Portio Mollis, and Portio Dura. The Eighth Pair arise by small Fasciculi from the Corpora Olivaria. The Ninth Pair of Nerves also arise by small Fasciculi a little below the former, from the Corpora Pyrami- dalia.

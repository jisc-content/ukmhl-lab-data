Sd OF THE VISCERA, &c. [Pakt IV. A Projection, called Eminentia Pyramidalis Tympani, situated behind the Fenestra Ovalis, in which is the Passage for the Stapedius. An Eminence at the upper and fore part of the Tym- panum, containing a semi-canal, for lodging part of the Tensor Tympani. In the Tympanum there are various Passages, which communicate with the neighbouring parts, viz. The Iter a Palato ad Aurem, or Eustachian Tube, which goes off from the upper and fore part of the Tym- panum, and, running obliquely forwards and inwards to the posterior Opening of the Nostril, terminates at its outer edge, above the Arch of the Palate. The posterior part of the Tube is Osseous, being- formed in the Pars Petrosa, at the upper and outer part of the Canal for the Carotid Artery. The anterior portion is formed above, by the Spinous Process, and root of the Pterygoid Process of the Sphe- noid Bone;—and below, by Cartilage and Membrane. It is narrower next the Ear, where it can only admit the point of a Surgeon’s Probe, but becomes gradually wider towards the Nose, where it terminates by an ob- lique Opening with prominent sides, sufficiently large to admit a Goose-quill. It is lined by a Membrane similar to that of the Nose, of which it appears to be a continuation ; and which, on the edtre of the Mouth of the Tube, is so thick as to add considerably to its prominency. The Eustachian Tube preserves the balance of Air between the Outer and Inner Ear, and prevents it from pressing

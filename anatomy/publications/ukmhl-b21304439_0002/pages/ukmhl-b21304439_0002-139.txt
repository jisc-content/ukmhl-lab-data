Part IV.] OF THE MOUTH, &c. 127 while of the time at which the Tooth begins to pass through the Gum. The Enamel is secreted by the Capsule which contains the Pulp, soon after the Osseous Shell has begun to be formed. It is always thickest where first deposited ; of course, it is thicker upon the Body than upon the Cervix of the Tooth. The Enamel is secreted in the form of a pure white earthy Substance, moistened with a Mucilage, and has much the appearance of crystallization. The deposition of the Enamel continues nearly as long as the Teeth are contained in their Capsules. It is at first, and even for some time after birth, so soft, as to be little firmer than Chalk, being easily scraped by the Nail, but soon acquiring a flinty hardness and a striated appearance. After the Bodies of the Teeth have attained their full size, no addition of Substance is made to the Enamel, the Membrane which produces it being destroyed pre- vious to the appearance of the Teeth beyond the Gums. The Osseous part of the Teeth, on the contrary, con- tinues to grow for a considerable time afterwards, one third of the length of the Fangs being added, after the Teeth have first appeared in the Mouth. While the Teeth are extending in their Sockets, they press upon their Capsules, and occasion an absorption of them ; the remains of the Capsules surround the Necks of the Teeth, and are gradually removed as the Tooth is completed.

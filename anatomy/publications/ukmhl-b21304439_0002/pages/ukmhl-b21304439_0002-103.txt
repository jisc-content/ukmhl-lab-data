OF THE EAR. Part IV.] 91 Tympanum Cribriform Holes appear, for the transmission of Branches of that part of the Portio Mollis destined for the Ves- tible and Semicircular Canals. In the upper Fossula of the Meatus Interims, there are Two Passages, one posterior and smaller, transmit- ting Nerves into the Elliptical Cavity of the Vestible. The other, the anterior and larger, is termed Canalis vel Aquccductns Fallopit,â€”from a resemblance it bears to an Italian Aqueduct; and serves for the transmission of the Portio Dura of the Seventh pair of Nerves. The Canal of Fallopius goes through the upper part of the Pars Petrosa, passes downwards and backwards between the Fenestra Ovalis and external Semicircular Canal, and terminates in the Foramen Stylo-Mastoi- dcum. In its passage through the Pars Petrosa, it communi- cates with the Foramen Innominatum, situated on the upper and fore part of the Petrous Process. In Children, the Labyrinth is almost as large as in A- dults, its Substance complete and hard, while the Bone which surrounds it is soft and spongy ; on which account it is easily separated from the rest of the Pars Petrosa. The different Cavities and Passages of the Labyrinth are lined with the Periosteum, which in the Vestible fills the Fenestra Ovalis, and of consequence covers the Base of the Stapes. The Periostea lining the two Canals of the Cochlea form the Membranous portion of the Lamina Spiralis, which, together with the Osseous part, completes the Septum between the two Scalae. The Periosteum of the Cochlea also assists that of the

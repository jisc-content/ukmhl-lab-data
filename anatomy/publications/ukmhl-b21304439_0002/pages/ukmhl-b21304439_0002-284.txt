OF THE VISCEliA, &c. [Fart IV* â€¢216 They The Vagina is a Membranous Canal, which extends from the Neck of the Uterus to the Opening of the Pu- dendum. It is situated at the under and back part of the Blad- der and Urethra, and over the under part of the Intes- tinum Rectum ; to each of which it is closely connected by Cellular Substance. It begins a little above the internal Orifice of the Ute- rus, which it embraces, but reaches higher at the poste- rior than anterior part; from which circumstance, toge- ther with a slight curvature it has backwards, the Canal is found to be longer in its posterior than anterior Surface. From the Os Tincae it passes downwards and for- wards, and terminates between the Labia Pudendi; the Axis of the Vagina forming a considerable Angle with that of the Uterus. .The dimensions of the Vagina correspond with the size of the Penis in the Male, but vary according to the temperament of the Body, and become larger in Wo- men who have born Children. The Body of the Vagina is composed of thick, strong, Membranous parts, which are very dilatable, and plen- tifully supplied with Blood-vessels. It is furnished in- ternally with numerous irregular Rugce or Wrinkles, and Nervous Papillae; the former of which considerably diminish the capacity of the Canal, and the latter add to its sensibility. The Ruga run in a transverse direction, and are so disposed as to divide the Vagina into anterior and pos- terior Columns, which join together laterally, and pro- duce a Raphe at the right and left sides.

Part IV.] ORGANS OF GENERATION. 247 They terminate in the Bladder at a little distance from each other, and at the same distance behind the begin- ning of the Urethra, each by a somewhat oval opening, which is more contracted than the Ureter is immediate- ly above it. Each of these openings is fixed by a Retinaculum formed by the inner Coat of the Bladder. This passes obliquely inwards and forwards, but is more distinctly seen when a probe is introduced into the orifice, and the part gently raised. Between the terminations of the Ureters and the be- ginning of the Urethra, is a space of a triangular form, —the Trigone of Lieutaud. The Arteries of the Bladder come from various sources, but chiefly from the Umbilicalis and Pudenda Communis. The Veins return to the Internal Iliacs :—They form a Plexus of considerable size upon each side of the Bladder, particularly about its Neck. The Lymphatics accompany the principal Veins on the Bladder, and at the under part and sides, pass into the Iliac Glands. The Nerves are Branches of the Great Sympathetic and Sacral Nerves. The Bladder receives the Urine from the Ureters by drops, and sometimes by small Thread-like streams or squirts, till, by its accumulated quantity and acrimony, it forces that Viscus to contract and expel it. The Urine is expelled, partly by the contraction of the Bladder itself, and partly by the action of the Ab- Q 4- dominal

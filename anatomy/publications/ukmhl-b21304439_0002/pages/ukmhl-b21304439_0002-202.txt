TOO OF THE VISCERA, &c. LFar*IV. The minal Viscera may be said to lie on tlic outside of the Peritoneum. In its passage from one Bowel to another, it forms Doublings which serve as Ligaments to fix the Bowels to each other, and likewise to the Body. It gives a general covering to most of the Bowels, a partial one to a few, and to those which are deep seated, and project least, a still more partial covering. It forms a large Sac, the posterior part of which ad- heres firmly to the different Viscera, and the anterior to the Abdominal Muscles ;â€”the part lining the Abdomen being merely in contact with its contents, and allowing a small degree of motion. The Cellular Substance on the External Surface of this Membrane, is not every where of equal thickness, being in some parts, as upon the Bowels, remarkably thin; in others, as over the Kidneys, filled with a con- siderable quantity of Eat. The Cellular Substance forms various Processes or Productions, some of which, as those on the Spermatic Cords, pass through Foramina, to be connected with the neighbouring parts ; and the Processes are sent offj without affecting the Internal Membrane; the one not accompanying the other. The Arteries of the Peritoneum come from the Inter- nal Mammary, Epigastric, Inferior Intercostal, Lum- bar, Sacral, and Ilio-Lumbar Arteries, and from those which supply the Abdominal Viscera. The Veins have the same course, bear the same names with the Arteries, and in general pass to the Inferior Cava.

OF THE VISCEftA, &c. [PartIV, Mater, behind the Meatus Internus, and half way be- tween the upper edge of the Pars Petrosa and Diverti- culum of the Internal Jugular Vein. The Nerves of the Labyrinth are derived entirely from the Seventh Pair. The Auditory Nerve is composed of two Branches, one of which is called Portio Dura, and is harder than the other, termed Portio Mollis. The Trunk of the Auditory Nerve passes into the Meatus Internus, covered by the investing Membrane of the Brain. The Portio Dura goes through the Canal is Falloph, sending off Branches through Perforations, in the sides of the Canal, to the Stapedius, and to the Mastoid Cells. One reflected Branch passing through the Foramen Innominatum in the Pars Petrosa, forms a connection between the Portio Dura and the second part of the Fifth Pair. Another, called Chorda Tympani, passes across the Cavity of the Tympanum, between the inferior Crus of the Incus and Handle of the Malleus, and, after run- ning along the outside of the Eustachian Tube, joins the Lingual Branch of the Fifth Pair. In its passage, it supplies the Muscles of the Malleus, and Membranes, Sic. of the Tympanum. The remainder of the Portio Dura is dispersed upon the Face. The Portio Mollis is divided into two principal parts, â€”one to the Cochlea, the other to the Vestible and Se- micircular Canals. The

222 OF THE VISCERA, &c. [Part IV. Artery was larger than usual, and the Veins, which commonly form the Vena Portae, terminated in the Vena Cava. 'Phe Vena Porfce is named f om its situation with re- spect to the Porta of the Liver. It partakes of the nature of an Artery and a Vein :— Like the former, it carries the Blood from the Trunk to the Branches, and, like the latter, it carries it to the Heart;—or it is peculiar in the Blood flowing in one part from the Branches to the 'Trunk, and in another from the Trunk to the Branches.

It passes to the Porta, where, from its great size, it is named Sinus Fence Portce, and divides into Branches which accompany those of the Artery in their course through the Substance of the Liver, terminating at last in the Pulpy Corpuscles. 'The Vena Purtec serves to carry Venous Blood to the Liver, for the secretion of the Bile. The Fence Hepaticce are numerous.

They unite by degrees, and accompany the other two Sets of Ves- sels ; but, at the root of the Liver, they form two or three large Trunks which terminate in the Vena Cava, where it is about to perforate the Diaphragm. They likewise send off 6ome small Branches which ter- minate

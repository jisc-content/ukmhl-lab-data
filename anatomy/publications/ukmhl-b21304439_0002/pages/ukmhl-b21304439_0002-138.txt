125 OF THE VISCERA, &c. [PartI Vi advances in the same maimer as that of a Tooth with a single root. At birth, the Capsules containing the Pulps of the Teeth can be separated into two Membranes, the exter- nal of which is of a Spongy and somewhat Vascular na- ture, and adheres to the Gums, while the internal, smoother and firmer than the former, and extremely Vascular, adheres to the Pulp. The Membrane of the Pulp derives its Vessels from those of the Gums, the Pulp receives its Vessels from those which enter the Foramina at the points of the Fangs. The Membrane containing the Pulp is firmly attach- ed to the inside of the Gum, and to the Basis of the Pulp, and has the same form with the Tooth it in- closes. The Vascularity of the Pulp is shewn by injection, as is also that of the Membrane by which it is covered ; and this appearance is rendered still more evident by examining the growing Teeth of large Animals, as those of the Elephant. That part of the Pulp lias the most Vascular appear- ance which is covered with Bone, but the Osseous Shell is found to adhere so slightly to the Pulp, as to be readi- ly separated from it without apparent laceration. The Osseous Matter of a Tooth is formed in Strata, one Layer being added within another, till the Tooth is completed. After the Osseous Substance is formed, the Enamel is added, which increases in thickness, till within a little while

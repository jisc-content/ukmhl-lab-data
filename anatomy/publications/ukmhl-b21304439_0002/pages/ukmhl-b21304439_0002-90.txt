78 OF THE VISCERA, kc. [Part IV. both of which .'ire Branches of the External Carotid Artery. The Veins pass partly to the External, and partly to the Internal Jugulars. The Nerves which supply the lore part of the Ear, arc derived from the third of the Fifth, and from the Portio Dura of the Seventh Pair. Those which supply the under and back part come from the first and second Cervicals. The Meatus Externus conveys sound from the outer towards the inner Ear, and is supposed to do this to greater advantage on account of the winding nature of the Passage. In the Foetus, the Meatus is entirely Cartilaginous, and only adheres to an imperfect Bony Circle, in which the Membrana Tympani is fixed. At the inner end of the Meatus Externus, the Mem- brana Tympani is situated, which is thin but firm, some- what dry and elastic, almost transparent, and of an oval form. It is fixed in a Groove which divides the Meatus from the Tympanum. It is very tense, but has a small Depression in the middle next the Meatus, with a corresponding Convexity towards the Tympanum, where the extremity of the Malleus is fixed to it. Its situation is somewhat oblique, the upper part be- ing turned outwards, and the under inwards, so that the lower side of the Meatus is a little longer than the upper. It

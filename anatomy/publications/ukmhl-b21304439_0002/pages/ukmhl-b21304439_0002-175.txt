163 Part IV.] OF THE THORAX. Ventricle in the same direction with the Valve from which they arise. They are fixed to the extremities of a few strong Pa- pillae or Columnae Carneae, which arc joined by their other extremities to the corresponding sides of the Ven- tricle. Besides the three principal portions of the Valve, it has some Tendinous Cords, and Fleshy Pil- lars of inferior size, fixed in the same manner with the rest. The Tricuspid Valve prevents the reflux of the Blood to the Auricle, during the contraction of the Ventricle. The Tendons allow the Valve to be pushed back by the Blood, until a Septum or Partition is formed by it at the Mouth of the Ventricle, during the contraction of the latter.—The Papillae, by their contraction, pre- i vent the Valve from going into the Auricle. The Valve is opened and pressed back by the Blood, in its passage from the Auricle to the Ventricle. The upper and left side of the Ventricle becomes smooth and uniform, and leads to a large Opening, about an inch in diameter, which is the Month of the Pulmonary Artery. The Right Ventricle, by its dilatation, receives the blood from the Auricle, and sends it, by a strong and sudden convulsive contraction, to the Pulmonary Ar- > tery, from whence it is prevented from returning by £ Three Valves placed in the Mouth of the Artery. The Valves at the Mouth of the Pulmonary Artery are called Valvulce Semilunares, vel Sigmoidctr, from the resemblance of their edges to those of a Crescent. Two L 2 ©f

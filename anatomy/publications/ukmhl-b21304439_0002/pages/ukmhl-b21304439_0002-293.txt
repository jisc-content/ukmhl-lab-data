Part IV.] ORGANS OF GENERATION. 285 ways conveyed to the Uterus after Impregnation, for sometimes a Foetus is found in the Ovarium; at other times in one of the Uterine Tubes ; and some rare in- stances have occurred, where the Embryo has dropped from one of the Ovaria or Tubes into the Cavity of the Abdomen, where a Placenta has been formed, by which it has been nourished. In these cases which are called Ex-uterine Conceptions, the Uterus is also found to be somewhat enlarged. The Ovum, at an early period of Gestation, consists of a thin Membranous Capsule, which incloses the Em- bryo or Germ with the Umbilical Cord and Waters j and the Capsule, again, consists of an internal Mem- brane called Amnios, on the outside of which is another, thicker and stronger than the former, termed True Cho- rion, which is covered with a Filamentous and Spongy Substance, named by Ruysch Tunica Filamentosa, and by more modern Authors, the False or Spongy Chorion. The Spongy Chorion is described by Du Hunter as consisting, in early Gestation, of two Layers ; one lin- ing the Cavity of the Uterus, and termed by him Mem- brana Decidua, from being supposed to be cast off from the Uterus; the other, covering that part of the Ovum which does not adhere to the Uterus, he terms Decidua Fhflexa ; the one appearing to be a continuation of, or reflected from, the other; of course, four Layers or Coats are found in the Uterus in the beginning of Preg- nancy. The Decidua is least distinct between the Uterus and Placenta. Near the edge of the Placenta, the Decidua and that part of it called lleflexa, are thickest and strongest,

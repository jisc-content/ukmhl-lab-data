OF THE VISCERA, kc. [Part IV. 112 the laryt and the Sublingual,—besides many small Glands named from the parts to which they belong. They are of a yellowish colour, and irregular on their Surface, being of the Conglomerate kind. The Parotid Gland, which is the largest of the Sali- vary Glands, is named from its situation near the Ear. It occupies the whole space between the Ear, Mastoid and Styloid Processes, and Angle of the Lower Jaw. It extends superiorly to the Zygoma, and anteriorly to the Masseter, part of which it covers. The under end of it lies contiguous to the Submaxil- lary Gland. From the different parts of the Gland, numerous small Branches arise, which join together to form a large Duct, sometimes called Steno’s Salivary Duct, or Ductus Superior, which passes from the upper and fore part of the Gland. The Parotid Duct is of a white colour, and large size, but, from the thickness of its Coats, the Cavity is small, in proportion to the general size of the Duct. It traverses the Masseter about its middle height, and where the Muscle is tendinous; in consequence of which, it is free from compression, and descends a little to perforate the Buccinator, and Membrane of the Mouth, by an orifice without any Papilla, opposite to the second or third Dens Molaris of the Upper Jaw. In crossing the Masseter, it receives sometimes one, sometimes two minute Ducts, from an equal number of small Glands, called by Haller Glandulce Accessories. The Submaxillary Gland is smaller and rounder than

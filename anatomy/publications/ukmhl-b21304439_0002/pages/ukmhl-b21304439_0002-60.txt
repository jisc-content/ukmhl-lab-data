It is so remarkably thin, that the colour of the sub- jacent parts appears readily through it. Between this Coat and the white part of the Eye, there is a quantity of loose Cellular Substance, which is very Vascular, and is the common seat of Ophthalmia. The Tunica Adnata supports the Ball of the Eye, prevents extraneous Bodies from getting to the back part of it, and forms a smooth covering to lessen the friction between the Eye and Eye-lids.

It is found also to become more convex when we look at near objects, and the reverse when we view those at a distance.

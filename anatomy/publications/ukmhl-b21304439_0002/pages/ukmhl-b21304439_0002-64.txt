52 Of THE VISCERA, &c. [Part IV. are fixed to the fore part of the Tunica Sclerotica. These, or the Cellular Vaginae covering them, have been supposed to give an additional whiteness to the Eye, and the part giving this whiteness has been termed Tu- nica Albuginea:—But the Sclerotic Coat is every where of a pure white, and can receive little additional bright- ness from any such covering. Tunica Choroides. The Choroides lies under the Sclerotica, and is con- nected to it by the Trunks of Vessels and Nerves which pass from the one Coat to the other, and also by a ten- der Cellular Substance, of a brown colour, which tinges the inner Surface of the Sclerotica. It begins at the entrance of the Optic Nerve into the Eye, runs between the Sclerotica and Retina, nearly to the Crystalline Lens, where it is more firmly connected to the Sclerotic Coat than it is elsewhere, by means of the Ciliary Circle. The Ciliary Circle, or Ciliary Ligament as it is called, is composed of a quantity of condensed shining Cellular Substance, which forms a white Ring connecting the fore part of the Choroides, and the root or outer margin of the Iris, to the Sclerotica. The Choroid Coat is much thinner and more tender than the Sclerotic, and is one of the most Vascular parts of the Body, seeming at first sight to be entirely composed of Vessels.—The greater number of those on the outside run in whirls j while those on the inside, taking a direction nearly parallel to each other, gave rise

â€˜260 OF THE VISCE11A, &c. [Part IV. closely applied to the sides of each other, and each covered by a strong, elastic, Ligamentous Sheath, the Fibres of which run in a transverse, and partly in an oblique direction. They arise one on each side, by two blind Conical extremities, called their Crura, from the inner part of the Crura of the Ossa Ischia and Ossa Pubis, to both of which they are very firmly connected by Ligamen- tous substance, being in a manner confounded there with the Periosteum. In their ascent along the Bones, they approach each other, and at the under part of the Symphysis Pubis, they unite, and continue united till they reach the Gians, where they terminate in a rounded extremity. At the upper part of the root of the Penis, the Liga- mentous Sheath of the Corpora Cavernosa sends up a Process of a triangular form, to be connected to the Symphysis Pubis, under the name of Ligamentum Sus- pensorium, by which the Body of the Penis is support- ed, and prevented from pressing too much upon the Scrotum. By the union of the Corpora Cavernosa, a Groove is left above for the principal Vein of the Penis, and a Channel below, for the Spongy Substance of the Ure- thra. The internal Substance of the Corpora Cavernosa consists of loose Reticular Plates, somewhat similar to the Cancelli in the ends of long Bones, and, like them, readily communicating with each other. Upon the Cells of the Corpora Cavernpsa the Arte- ries are plentifully dispersed, and open freely into them, the

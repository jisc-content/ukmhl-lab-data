Part IV.] OF THE EAR. 79 It forms a complete impervious Septum, though the contrary has been maintained by some Authors. It is formed partly of a continuation of the lining of the Meatus, but chiefly of the Periosteum. The Membrana Tympani has numerous small Vessels from the Temporal and Stylo-Mastoid Arteries, which run in a radiated manner, and which are most abundant in the Foetus. This Membrane serves to conduct the Sound from the Outer to the Inner Ear. In the Foetus, the Membrana Tympani is fixed in an imperfect Ring of Bone, being open above, and, along with the Meatus, is covered with a Mucous Membrane, wlijch defends the parts from the too strong impulse of â€¢Sound. Tiie Internal Ear. The Internal Ear comprehends the Tympanum, La- byrinth, and certain Passages leading into these. The Tympanum is situated at the inner side of the Membrana Tympani, approaches to a hemispherical fi- gure, and is about half an inch in width. Between the Tympanum and Cavity called Labyrinth, there is an Osseous Septum, which forms the bottom of the 1 ympanum, where there are several Eminences, viz. ihc Promontory, which forms the beginning of the Scala Tympani, and divides the Tympanum into ante- rior and posterior Regions. A Protuberance at the upper and back part of the 1 ympanum, formed by the Aquseductus Fallopii. A

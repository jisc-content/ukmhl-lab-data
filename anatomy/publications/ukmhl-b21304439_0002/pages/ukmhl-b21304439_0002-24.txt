OF THE VISCERA, &c. [Part IV. 22 Membrana Cellulauis, or Tela Cellulosa, or Re- ticular, or Cellular Substance. This is generally considered as one of the Integu- ments, though common to these and to the other parts of the Body. It is composed of a fine Web, formed of many Mem- branes joined irregularly together, and these made up of Cells, which communicate freely with each other wherever they are found. It is very elastic, may be drawn out to a considerable extent, after which it suddenly recoils, and may be con- densed or compacted to a great degree. It lines the Skin, covers the Muscles in general, and insinuates itself between their different Fibres ;—is an universal covering to all the other parts, and even enters into the composition of almost every one of them. It is thickest where the parts are most exposed to pressure, as in the Flips, Palms, and Soles. The different Cells of which it is composed are con- stantly moistened by an Interstitial Fluid, and in many parts of the Body are filled with Fat. It has little or no Sensibility, can be handled freely, or cut, or punctured, without giving pain. It serves to connect parts to*each other, but so as to prevent them from growing together :—it covers them, supplies them with Sheaths to move in, and contains •»he Fat. Corpus

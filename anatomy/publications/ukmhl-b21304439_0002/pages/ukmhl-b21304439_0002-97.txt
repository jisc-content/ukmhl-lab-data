s? Part IV.] OF THE EAR. F 4 the Five similar Foramina behind, by which it commu- nicates with the Semicircular Canals. Towards the Meatus Auditorius Internus, it has four or five Cribriform Perforations, for the transmission of Nerves. The Cochlea is placed obliquely, next the anterior ex- â€¢ tremity of the Os Petrosum, and at the fore part of the Vestible, in such a manner as to have its Base towards the Meatus Auditorius Internus, and its Apex in the opposite direction, or facing outwards. It has two Canals or Gyri, called Scalce, from a sup- posed resemblance to a stair-case ; one of which is placed on the outer and fore side, the other on the inner and back part. The Gyri are very close to each other, and run in a spiral direction, like the Shell of a Snail, from which the part has obtained its name. The Cochlea forms two Circumvolutions or Turns and a half the first of which is much larger and wider than the other turn and a half, which become suddenly smaller, the whole approaching to a globular form. The two Canals are upon the same level, the inner one next the Base, and the outer next the point of the Cochlea. The Gyri go round a Nucleus, Axis, or Central Pil- lar, which is nearly horizontal, and is formed of two hollow Coties, with their points turned to each other, the one termed Modiolus, from its resemblance to the Spindle of a winding Stair-case, the other Infundibu- lum, or Funnel. The Modiolus forms the inner and larger portion oi

The Permanent Teeth now come forwards under the Temporary Set, which, by the pressure being conti- nued, soon drop out. Besides the causes mentioned above, with respect to the shedding of the Teeth, others contribute j for now and then the Temporary Teeth drop out long before the Permanent Teeth appear, and sometimes where they never appear. That absorption of the first Set is much influenced, however, by pressure on the second Set, is rendered probable, from the instances where one or more of the Temporary Teeth have been observed remaining in the Jaws for many years, and where, upon examination, no Permanent Teeth have been found to be formed. Of the Growth of the Jaws. â™¦ After all the Temporary Teeth have appeared through the Gums, the Jaws are observed to grow little in the parts the Teeth occupy. The Lower Jaw receives its greater increase between the second Temporary Molaris and the Coronoid Pro- cess, the lengthened part being destined for the Per- manent Molares.

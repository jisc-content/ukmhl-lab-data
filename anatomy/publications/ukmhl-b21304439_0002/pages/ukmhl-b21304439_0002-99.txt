OF THE EAR. 89 Part IV.] the under and fore part of the Vestible, and is termed Scala Vestibuli; this is not shut by any Membrane : The other, which is the smaller of the two, communicates with the Tympanum by the Fenestra Rotunda, but is shut in the Subject by a Membrane, and is called Scala Tympani. The Partition between the two Gyri or Turns of the Cochlea, like the Osseous part of the Lamina Spiralis, is formed of two Plates, with a small Cavity between them. The Volute, or Spiral of the Cochlea, begins below, yuns forwards, and then round, so as to form, as has been already mentioned, two Circles or Turns and a half, the direction of the Gyri corresponding with those of the Shell of a Snail. The Canals of the Cochlea are conical, becoming gradually smaller towards the Apex, where they com- municate with each other, through the medium of the Infundibulum. This communication is called by C’as- sebohm, who gives the fullest Treatise upon the Ear, Canalis Scalarum Communis. The Semicircular Canals are three in number,—the Superior or Vertical,—the Posterior or Oblique,—and the Exterior or Horizontal. The Superior is placed transversely, in the upper part of the Pars Petrosa, with its convex side upwards. The Posterior is farther back than the former one, and is parallel to the length of the Pars Petrosa, with the convex side turned backwards.—One of its extremi- ties is placed above, and the other below, the upper ex- tremity

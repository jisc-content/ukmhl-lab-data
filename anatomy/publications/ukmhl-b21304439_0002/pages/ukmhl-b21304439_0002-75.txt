Part IV.] 63 OF THE EYE. Albinus derives these Vessels from a double source. —In the Eye of a Whale, he demonstrated Vessels passing from the Ciliary Processes to the substance of the Lens; and, at a later period, he injected in the Human Eye a small Branch arising from the Central Artery of the Retina, which proceeded in a straight direction through the Vitreous Humour, and divided in the posterior part of the Capsule into numerous Branches, many twigs of which plunged into the sub- stance of the Lens. This Artery and its Branches have been frequently and successfully injected by succeeding Anatomists. Vitreous Humour. The Vitreous Humour is situated in the back part of the Cavity of the Eye, which it occupies from the in- sertion of the Optic Nerve to the Surface of the Crys- talline Lens. It is round at the back part and sides, where it is covered by the Retina; but is concave before, where it forms a bed for the Crystalline Lens. It is by much the largest of the three Humours, oc- cupying upwards of nine-tenths of the whole Eye, and has a Gelatinous appearance,—or is somewhat like the Glaire of an Egg. In an Adult, it is always very transparent; and in an Old Person, it docs not, like the Lens, degenerate into a yellow, or any other colour. In the Foetus, like the Aqueous Humour, it is of a reddish colour. The

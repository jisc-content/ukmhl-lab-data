Part IV.] OF THE THORAX. 161 In the Adult, it is supposed to prevent the Blood of the Auricle from passing into the Inferior Cava; and in the Foetus, to direct the Blood of the Inferior Cava to the Foramen Ovale. Upon the left side of the Valve of Eustachius, in the under part of the Auricle, is the Orifice or Termination of the great Coronary Vein of the Heart. Over the Orifice of this Vein, there is a Semilunar Valve, to prevent the Blood in the Auricle from passing ■into the Vein. The inner side of the proper Auricle is readily distin- guished from the Sinus, by having a number of Fleshy * Pillars in it, which, from their supposed resemblance to the Teeth of a Comb, sometimes obtain the name of Musculi Auriculce Pectinati. The Musculi Pectinati have smaller Columns running C in different directions* giving the whole a reticulated ap- pearance. Between the 1 leshy Pillars, are Depressions or Fur- ivies, where the sides of the Auricle are thin, and semi- ' transparent, being chiefly formed of the outer and inner Membranes only. At the under and left side of the Sinus Venosus, and opposite to a Groove situated externally between the Auricle and Ventricle, there is a Hole, above an inch n diameter, which opens into the upper and right part of the corresponding Ventricle. The Right Auricle receives the Blood from the Venae ^avae and Coronary \cins, and, by its Muscular con i action, discharges it into the corresponding Ventricle, >ut of which it is prevented from returning by a Valve, ■ailed Tricuspid, placed within the Ventricle.

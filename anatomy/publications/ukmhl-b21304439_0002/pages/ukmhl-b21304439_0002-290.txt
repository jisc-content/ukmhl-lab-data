282 OF THE VISCERA, &c. [Part IV, have also many Nervous Papillae, which render them very sensible, and Sebaceous Follicles, the Contents of which, of a Foetid nature, prevent them from being in- jured by the Urine. The Nymphae assist in directing the course of the Urine from the Urethra, and in preventing the Air from entering the Vagina.—They also tend to enlarge the passage for the Child in the time of Parturition. Between the Perinoeum andNjmphae, there is a Ves- tibulum, or smooth Cavity, which is most complete in Virgins, and leads to two Passages,—to the Urethra above, and to the Vagina below. Tin Onjice of the Urethra is placed a little below the Glai . of the Clitoris, and between the two Nymphae, and is surrounded by a Spongy Eminence, which pro- jects at its under part,—called by some Authors Corpus Glandulosum, or Glandules Prostata Mulierum. The Corpus Glandulosum is perforated by Lacuna ; some of which are of considerable depth, and discharge a Viscid Matter round the Orifice of the Urethra. The Corpus Glandulosum directs the point of the Finger to the Orifice of the Urethra, in discharging the Urine by the Catheter. The Orifice oj' the Vagina, termed likewise Os Exter- num Uteri, is placed immediately under that of the Urethra, and is naturally straiter than the rest of the Canal; but in the Virgin state, is still more contracted by the Substance called Hymen, or Circulus Membrano- sus, which forms an incomplete Septum between the Vagina and External Parts. The Hymen is formed of a double Membrane, and is red

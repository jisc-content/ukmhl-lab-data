OF THE VISCERA, &c. [Part IV. 226 no need of it, and retains it till wanted for the purpose of Digestion.—It is afterwards discharged from the Gall- Bladder, when the Stomach is full, into the Ductus Communis, and from that to the Duodenum, chiefly by the pressure of the surrounding Viscera, and partly, as some Anatomists suppose, by a small degree of contrac- tile power in the Gall-Bladder itself. The whole of the Bile contained in the Gall-Bladder, is found, by experiment, to pass from the Liver through the Hepatic Duct to the Ductus Communis, and from that by the Cystic Duct into the Gall-Bladder. The Bile returning from the Gall-Bladder, is observ- ed, from the thinner parts being absorbed, to be thicker, more acrid and bitter, and of a deeper colour, than that which flows from the Liver. The Ductus Communis Cholcdochus is about the size of a Goose quill, and is considerably larger than either of the Ducts which open into it. It descends at the posterior and left side of the first portion ol the Duodenum, and passes for some way ob- liquely between the Muscular and Inner Coats of the Gut,—the Obliquity answering the purpose of a Valve. It terminates in the left posterior, and nearly in the under part of the second turn of the Intestine, by a pro- jecting Orifice, which is rounded above, and pointed below. The StructuVeof the Ductus Choledochus, and of the Biliary Ducts in general, is of the same nature, being entirely Membranous. The Inner Surface of the Ducts . also agrees in being perforated by numberless Pores, which

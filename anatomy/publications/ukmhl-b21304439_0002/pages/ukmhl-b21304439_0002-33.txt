Part IV.] OF THE BRAIN. 21 inclosing all its convolutions, without insinuating itself between any of them. At the upper part of the Brain, it adheres so closely to the subjacent Coat by fine Cellular Substance, that it can scarcely be separated from it; but in different parts of the Base of the Brain, particularly about the Tuber Annulare and Medulla Oblongata, it is merely in con- tact with the Membrane under it, and may readily be raised from it by the assistance of the Blow-pipe. The Tunica Arachnoidea, like the Cuticle, covers and defends the parts under it. The Pia Mater, named from its tenderness, is some- what of the nature of the former Covering, but is ex- tremely Vascular. It envelopes the Brain in general, enters double be- tween all its Convolutions, and lines the different Cavi- ties called Ventricles. It serves to contain and support the Vessels of the Brain, and allows them to divide into such minute parts, as to prevent the Blood from entering the tender Sub- stance of this Viscus with too great force. The Arteries of the Pia Mater are the same with those of the Brain, and are derived from the Internal Caro- tids and Vertebrals. The Veins differ in no respects from those of the other Viscera, excepting in this, that they do not accompany the Arteries. The Brain is divided into Cerebrum> Cerebellumy Tu- ber Annulare, and Medulla Oblongata. B S Cerebrum.

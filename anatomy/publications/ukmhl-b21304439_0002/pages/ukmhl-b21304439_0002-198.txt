OF THE VISCERA, &c. [Part IV. 186 passes behind (lie Aorta, crossing obliquely from left to right, till it gets to the right side of that Artery. Upon the first Lumbar Vertebra, it forms an Oval Sac, termed lleceptacvlum Chyli, which is placed behind the Right Crus of the Diaphragm, and a little higher than the Right Renal Artery. The Duct afterwards passes between the Crura of the Diaphragm, and ascends in the Thorax, on the antc- » rior part of the Spine, between the Layers of the pos- terior Mediastinum, on the right side of the Aorta, and between it and the Vena Azygos. It crosses behind the upper part of the descending Aorta, and emerges from the Thorax, to reach the un- der part of the left side of the Neck. In the Neck, it passes behind the Internal Jugular Vein, and a little higher than the Subclavian. It then turns downwards, forming an Arch, which terminates in the upper part of the Angle, between the Internal Jugular and Subclavian of the Left Side. The Thoracic Duct receives the Chyle from the Lac- teals, and Lymph from the Lymphatics, and discharges these into the red Veins. •*« OF

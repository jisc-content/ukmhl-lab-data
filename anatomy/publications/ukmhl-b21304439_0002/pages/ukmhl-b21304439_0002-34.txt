22 OF THE VISCERA, See. [Part IV. t Cerebrum. The Cerebrum, or Brain, properly so called, is si- tuated in the upper part of the Cranium, which it com- pletely fills. It is divided into two halves, termed Hemispheres, which are separated from each other by the Falx. Each of the Hemispheres is of an oval form, or they somewhat resemble an Egg cut longitudinally into two equal parts. The inner sides arc fiat, and closely ap- plied to the Falx, the upper and outer parts convex, and the under Surface irregular. The under Surface is divided into two Anterior, two Lateral, and two Posterior Lobes, or Processes. The Anterior Lobes are situated in the fore part of the Base of the Cranium. The Lateral or Middle Lobes are lodged in the Fossae formed by the Temporal and Sphenoid Bones. The Posterior Lobes are placed over the Cerebellum, and are separated from it by the Tentorium. Between the Anterior and Lateral Lobes, there is a Furrow formed by the Anterior Clinoid Processes of the Sphenoid Bone, which has been termed Fossa, or Fis- sura Magna Sylvii. The Surface of the Brain is divided by deep Fissures, into many turnings or windings, termed Circumvolutions, which run in various directions, and are of different sizes and lengths on different parts of the Brain. The Circumvolutions are every where connected to the Pia Mater by an infinite number of small Vessels,â€” called

OF THE VISCERA, &c. [Part IV. i6 the thickest and strongest Membrane of the Body, and is composed of Tendinous-like Fibres, which have a shining appearance, particularly in its inner Surface. In many parts these Fibres run in a variety of direc- tions, and decussate each other at different Angles. The Dura Mater adheres every where to the Surface of the Cranium, in the same manner as the Periosteum adheres to the Bones in the other parts of the Body; but it is more firmly connected at the Sutures and Fo- ramina than elsewhere; and so much more firmly in Children than in Adults, that, in separating it from the Cranium, it is apt to bring along with it some of the Fibres of the Bone to which it is attached.—In the Adult, the separation of the Bone from the Membrane is less difficult, in consequence of many of the Fibres being obliterated. The inner Surface of the Dura Mater, which is re- markably smooth, is in close contact with the Brain, but adheres only where the Veins go into the Sinuses ;—and is lubricated by a Fluid discharged through its Vessels, which guards the Brain from danger, according as it may be affected by the different states of Respiration. The Dura Mater serves as a defence to the Brain, and supplies the place of a Periosteum to the inside of the Bones of the Cranium, giving nourishment to them,— as is evident from the numerous drops of Blood which appear after removing the Skull-cap. From the inner side of the Dura Mater, Processes arc sent off’, which divide the Brain into certain parts, and serve to keep it steady ; viz. I. The

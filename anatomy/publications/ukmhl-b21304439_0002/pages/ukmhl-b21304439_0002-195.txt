I Part IV.] OF THE THORAX. 183 contraction of the Abdominal and a few other Muscles, —assisted in strong Expirations chiefly by the 1 riangu- .ares Stprni, Sacro-lumbales, and Serrati Postici Infe- riores,—of the elasticity of the Cartilages of the Ribs, sand the elasticity and contractile nature of the Bronchi, )3y which the Cavity of the Thorax is diminished, and uhe Air is expelled from the Lungs. Upon the alternate states of Inspiration and Expira- tion depend the formation of the Voice, the sensation of Smell, and all the other functions of the Body :— iBut the grpat and principal office of the Lungs, which was formerly supposed to be that of cooling the Blood coverheated by Friction, is, during Inspiration, to re- ceive from the Atmosphere pure Air, upon which the {principle of heat and life depends ; and, during Expi- iration, to carry off an impure Air, which is noxious to JLife. According to late Experiments, it appears,—that the YVenous Blood passing to the Lungs of a dark red or {purple colour, is charged with Carbon and Hydrogen ; —that, while circulating upon the Bronchial Cells, one ipart of the Oxygen, contained in the common Air vwliich has been inspired, unites with the Carbon and IHydrogen, and forms fixed Air and a Watery Ilalitus, which are carried off by Expiration ;—that another part ■ of the Oxygen is imbibed by the Blood, which, in con- sequence of these changes, or having received an Arte- rial quality, returns from the Lungs of a florid red co- lour, and full of heat in a latent state, w hich becomes .) sensible in the course of the general circulation, and is M 4- diffused

Behind, it lies flat upon the Cervical Vertebrae, and upon the Muscles which cover the fore part of the sides of these Vertebrae. It has several Openings by which it communicates with the neighbouring Cavities.

The Pharynx is surrounded by a loose Cellular Sub- stance, and consists of different Layers of Muscles, call- ed Constrictores Pliaryngis, which have been already described.

The lower end of the Pharynx, opposite to the under edge of the Cricoid Cartilage, describes a complete Circle, which forms the beginning of the Esophagus.

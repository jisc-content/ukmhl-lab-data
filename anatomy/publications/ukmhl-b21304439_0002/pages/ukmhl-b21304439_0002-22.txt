OF THE VISCERA, &c. [Part IV. 10 The Bulbs are of various shapes in different parts of the Body, and have Blood-vessels dispersed upon them for their nourishment. Each of the Bulbs has two Membranes, or Capsules, containing an Oily Fluid between them, which gives colour to the Hair, and for want of which, as in ad- vanced life, when the Capsule shrivels, or in certain diseases, the Flair is supposed to change its colour, and become white. It may be remarked, however, that the Flair, after being cut off, continues uniformly to pre- serve its colour. The colour of the Hair has some relation to the Cor- pus Mucosum, since in the Negro the tint of the Hair corresponds with that of the Skin, and in a Person with red or with dark-coloured Flair, there is a rosy or a dark complexion. The Flairs, in passing from the Skin, carry with them Processes of the Epidermis, which serve them as Sheaths, and which are so thin and transparent, as to allow the colour of the Hairs to appear through them. In the Human Body, the Flairs are so slender, that it is difficult to trace their structure; but in the strong Hairs of certain Quadrupeds, this becomes apparent. By the assistance of a good glass, these large Hairs are observed to be composed of a bundle of smaller Flairs, among which are one or two Canals for containing their nourishing fluid, termed the Medulla. By desiccation, the Hairs separate at their points into thin constituent Filaments, The Flairs, like the Nails, grow from their bases, in consequence of which, when they are cut short, they seem

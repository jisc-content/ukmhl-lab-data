OF THE TEETH. Of the Structure of the Teeth in the ApuIt. The Teeth are situated in the Alveoli of the Jaws, and are sixteen in number in each Jaw. Each Tooth consists of a Base or Body, and one or more iRoots or Fangs; the former appearing without, the latter within the Sockets. Around the Surface, where the Body ends and the Root begins, the Tooth is a little depressed where it forms the Cervix or Collar of the Tooth. The Roots are of a Conical form, becoming gradual- ly smaller as they recede from the Body of the Tooth, in consequence of which, pressure is removed from the tender parts placed at their points, and divided equally over the Surface of the Fangs. Upon the Body of each Tooth, there is an additional Covering, termed Cortex Striata, or Enamel, which is spread over all that part of the Tooth that, in the healthy state, is not covered by the Gums.

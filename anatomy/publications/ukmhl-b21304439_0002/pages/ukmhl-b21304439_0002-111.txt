Part IV.] 99 OF THE NOSE. of Sebaceous Glands, the contents of which may be rea- dily squeezed out by the pressure of the Fingers. The Cartilages of the Nose are moved in different di- rections, by the following Muscles on each side, which have been already described ; viz. the Compressor Na- rium, the Nasal part of the Frontal Muscle, and the Le- vator and Depressor Labii Superioris ALceque Nasi.—The Nose may also be moved by the neighbouring Muscles, which, in many instances, become assistants to the others. The Internal Nares or Cavities of the Nose extend upwards to the Cribriform Plate of the Ethmoid, and to the Body of the Sphenoid Bone. At the inner side, they are bounded by the Septum Narium, which is formed by the Nasal Lamella of the Ethmoid Bone, by the Vomer, and by the middle Car- tilage of the Nose. On the outside, or that next the Cheek, the Ossa Spongiosa project a considei’able way into the Cavities of the Nares, and increase the Surface of the Membrane of the Nose, for enlarging the Organ of Smell; and in Animals which smell acutely, the Ossa Spongiosa are remarkably large and complex. The bottom of the Nostrils runs directly backwards, so that a straight Probe may be passed through either of them to the Throat. In the fore part of the Nostrils there are stiff Hairs, called Vibrissce, which prevent the Mucus from con- stantly flowing, and insects or other extraneous matter from entering. Hie general Cavity of each Nostril is divided by the G 2 Ossa

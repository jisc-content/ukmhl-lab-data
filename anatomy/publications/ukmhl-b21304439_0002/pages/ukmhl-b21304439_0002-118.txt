OF THE VISCERA, See. [PartIV. 10 G The Membrane of the Mouth is covered with fine Villi; but these are most conspicuous upon the edges of the Lips, as may be distinctly seen after a fine In- jection, or after macerating the parts till the Cuticle can be separated. From the edges of the Lips, the common Integu- ments, now become extremely thin, are converted into the Membrane which lines the Mouth, and which, op- posite to the Dentes Incisores of the Upper and Under Jaws, forms two Doublings or Frcena, which fix the Lips more firmly to the Jaws. The Lips are serviceable in the general purposes of Speaking, Eating, Drinking, &c. The Gums cover the sides of the Alveolar Border of both Jaws, pass in between the different Teeth, and surround and adhere firmly to the Collar of each. The Substance of the Gums is of a dense nature, and very Vascular, and the Vessels are united by a compact Cellular Substance. They may be said to consist of the common Mem- brane of the Mouth and the Periosteum of the Jaws in- timately connected. They serve as a Covering to the Jaws, and contribute to the security of the Teeth. The Arteries of the Lips, Cheeks, and Gums, are from the Facial, Temporal, and Internal Maxillaries, which are derived from the External Carotids. The Veins go chiefly to the External, and partly to the Internal Jugulars. The Nerves come from the first and second Branches of

28 OF THE VISCERA, &c. [Part IV. Brain, has been found full of water in cases of Hydro- cephalus. Under the Septum Luc.idum is placed the Substance which has been compared in shape to a Vault by the Ancients, and from that has obtained the name of Fornix. The Fornix is merely a continuation of the Corpus Callosum, and forms a sort of hollow Ceiling, with four Pillars, called Crura, or Cornua, from their winding direction, of which there are two anterior, and two pos- terior. The two Anterior Crura are short, run close together, and become enlarged at their inferior parts. The two Posterior Crura are long, at a considerable distance from each other, and form Curvatures which correspond with the course of the Inferior Cornua of the Lateral Ventricles. That part of the Crura Fornicis lying in the Inferior Cornua of these Ventricles, forms thin Borders getting the name of Corpora Fimbriata;—but, according to Vic D’Azyr, they are more properly termed Tcenia Plippocampi, from being united with the great Hippo- campus. The Body of the Fornix is narrow anteriorly, and becomes considerably broader behind, where it is incor- porated with the Corpus Callosum. The under Surface of the posterior part of the Body of the Fornix is impressed with numerous transverse and oblique Lines, which have been called Psalterium, or Lyra, from some resemblance they bear to the ancient musical instruments of these names.

OF THE EYE. 61 Part IV.] Person advances in life.â€”This difference, however, of convexity, colour, and consistence, according to the dif- ference of age, is not met with uniformly. The Lens becomes opake soon after death, and ac- quires an additional opacity when put into Spirit of Wine. It is composed of concentric Lamella?, laid over each other like the coats of an Onion. These Lamellae are connected by fine Cellular Substance, and are more closely compacted the nearer they are to the centre. This Lamellated structure may be readily observed in the Eye of an Ox, or any other large Animal, but is most evident when the Lens has been macerated in Water or Vinegar. When the maceration is continued for some time, the Lamellae put on a radiated appearance, the Radii run- ning in a vertical manner, or issuing from the centre to the circumference, dividing the Surface into Isosceles Triangles, or like the Meridian lines running between the two poles of a Geographical Globe. The Lamellae were discovered by Leuwenhof.ck. to be of a Fibrous structure. By some Authors these Fi- bres have been considered as Muscular, and capable of varying the convexity of the Lens according to the dis- tance of the objects we look at; but it is observed, that the Eyes from which the Lens has been removed, are, by the assistance of Glasses, enabled to form distinct vision. The substance of the Lens somewhat resembles half- melted Gum, is very soft and tender on the outside, but becomes

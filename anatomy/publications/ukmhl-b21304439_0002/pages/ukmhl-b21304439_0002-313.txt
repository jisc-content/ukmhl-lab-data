Part IV.] OF THE FOETUS. 305 In the Foetal Quadruped, it is a large Tube, whicli transmits Urine from the Bladder to a Bag between the Amnios and Chorion, called Allantois. The common Iliac Arteries divide, on each side, into a small External, and large Internal Branch, in conse- quence of which, the Lower Extremities are less in pro- portion than in the Adult. The principal part of the Internal Uiacs is occupied in forming the Umbilical Arteries, which mount by the sides of the Bladder, on the outside of the Peritoneum^, and perforate the Umbilicus in their progress to the Umbilical Cord. Soon after Delivery, the Foramen Ovale, Ductus Ar- teriosus, and Venosus, with the Umbilical Vein and Ar- teries, begin to contract, and are, in general, complete- ly closed, and the Vessels shrivelled into Ligaments, within a vear after Birth. This Obliteration is produced by a contractile power in the parts, by a pressure in the surrounding Viscera, and by the Blood being directed through other chan- nels. The Pelvis of the Foetus is commonly so small, that the principal parts of its Viscera are contained in the open Cavity of the Abdomen. The Prepuce of the Clitoris is proportionally so much larger in a young Foetus than it is afterwards, that, in an Abortion, a Female Foetus has frequently been mis- taken for a Male. The Testes are lodged, during the greater part of Gestation, in the Cavity of the Abdomen, over the Psoae Muscles, and a little below the Kidneys. vVOL. II. U They

From the Lungs, the Blood, now purified, is returned to the left side of the Heart, to be circulated through all the other parts of the Body, thereby imparting nourish- ment, growth, and strength, to the general System ; being found also to be the source of Sensibility, Irrita- bility, Motion, and Animal Heat. LUNG S. The Lungs are two soft Spongy Bodies, which occupy the far greater part of the Cavity of the Thorax. They completely fill the two Bags of the Pleura, and are every where in contact with the parts adjacent; no Air intervening between them and the Thorax. In Figure, they have been compared to that of the Foot of an Ox, with the back part turned forwards ;— or, their shape corresponds exactly with the inside of the Thorax; being rounded next the Ribs, hollow towards the Diaphragm, and irregularly flattened and depressed next the Mediastinum and Heart.

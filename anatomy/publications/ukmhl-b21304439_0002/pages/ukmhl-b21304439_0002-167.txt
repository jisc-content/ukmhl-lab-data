Part IV.] OF THE THORAX. 155 tervvards passes to the Lungs and Lateral parts of the Diaphragm. The Internal Layer is smooth, tendinous-like, polish- ed on its inner Surface, and stronger than the other. It adheres so firmly to the Tendinous part of the Diaphragm, as not to be separated from it without much difficulty. The Pericardium extends a considerable way beyond the base of the Heart, and includes the large Blood-ves- sels, as far as the roots of their first principal Branches, in consequence of which it forms several Angles, which have been termed Cornua of the Pericardium. While the External Layer is reflected to cover the parts which surround it, the Internal is also reflected, first over the roots of the large Blood-vessels, and then over the Heart, to form its proper covering â€¢, in the same manner the Tunica Conjunctiva is reflected from the Eye-lids to cover the fore part of the Eye. From the ends of the Extreme Arteries upon its Sur- face, a Fluid, called Liquor Pericardii, is discharged, by which it is lubricated, and the effects of friction di- minished. The Liquor Pericardii is commonly found, after death, in the quantity of a few Drachms, though not unfrequently of one or two Ounces. Its colour is redder in a young Subject than in a Per- son advanced in life, in whom it becomes paler, or more of a straw colour. The Arteries of the fore part of the Pericardium are from the Internal Mammaries and Diaphragmatics; those

HO OF THE VISCERA, See. [Part IV. above the Glottis, is of an oval form when surrounded by its Ligaments and Membranes; but when divested of these, it is found to be narrow below', broad above, and rounded, and slightly notched, at its upper extre- mity. It is convex towards the Tongue, and concave to- wards the Glottis, with its point reflected a little for- wards. It is placed behind the upper part of the Thyroid Cartilage, is situated obliquely over the Glottis, and may be seen and examined in the living Body, by press- ing down the root of the Tongue. Its under end is fixed by a broad and short Ligament to the middle Notch of the Thyroid Cartilage; laterally it is attached by two Ligaments to the whole length of the Arytenoid Cartilages. It is fixed to the roots of the Os Hyoides ar.d Tongue by another Ligament, which is a doubling of the inner Membrane running along the middle of its anterior Sur- face, and forming the Freenum Epiglottidis. It is very elastic, and is much more pliable than the ether Cartilages, being of a Cartilago-Ligamentous na- ture. It is found to have a number of Fissures, in which Lactinee are placed, and to be perforated by numerous Foramina, which are the Mouths of so many Mucous Follicles, and which arc in a great measure concealed by the Membrane which covers it. It breaks the current of the Air coming from the Mouth and Nose, and prevents it from rushing too forcibly into the Cavity of the Lungs. Pressed and drawn

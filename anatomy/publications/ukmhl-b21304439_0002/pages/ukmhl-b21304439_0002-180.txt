OF THE VISCERA, &c. [PartIV. 1G8 the The inner Surface of the Left Ventricle has the same general appearance with the Ventricle of the right side, but differs from it in having its Column® Carneoe larger, and more numerous, firmer, and stronger; more detached, and more varied in their directions. They form Meshes in the shape of Lozenges, in which are Column® of a more slender nature, intercepting Meshes of an inferior size. In the Passage of communication between the Auricle and Ventricle, there is a Ring, from which a Circular Valve goes off, with all its Apparatus similar to that be- tween the right Auricle and Ventricle, and differing in no respect from it in structure and use, excepting in being stronger, and in being divided into two principal Portions only. This Valve has been supposed to bear some resem- blance to a Bishop’s Mitre, frojn which it lias been call- ed Valvula Mi traits. < One of the Portions of this Valve is larger than the oilier, lies over the Mouth of the Aorta, and is sup- posed to cover it while the Ventricle is filling. The Valvula Mitralis prevents the reflux of the Blood during the contraction of the Ventricle. After the contraction is over, the Valve returns to its former situation, by the impulse of a fresh current of Blood from the Auricle. Between the Right and Left Ventricle, there is a thick, strong, impervious Partition, which forms 4 share of the General Septum Cordis, and is composed partly by the Wall of the Right, but chiefly by that of

They have been supposed to be formed originally by an Efflorescence thrown out upon the parts on which they are placed, in the manner it is thrown out upon in- flamed Surfaces. Between the Amnios and Chorion, a large proportion of Gelatinous Fluid is contained in the early Months, which separates them at a considerable distance from each other. At this period a small Bag, filled with a milky-like Fiuid, is observed on the Amnios, near the insertion of the Umbilical Cord, and is termed Vesicula Umbiliculis vel Alba. The Vesicula Umbilicalis is connected to the Cord by a Filament consisting of an Artery and Vein, Branches from the Umbilical Vessels, which, with the Fluid and Bag, soon disappear. The use of this Vesicle, which has sometimes been mistaken for an Allantois, is not yet understood. In early Gestation, the Ovum is large in proportion to the Embryo; but towards the latter period of Preg- nancy, the proportion is reversed, as appears from the following Observations. No well-authenticated account has been yet received, of the Embryo being observable till near the end of the third Week, when it is found to appear like an oblong curved

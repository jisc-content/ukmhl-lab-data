OF THE EYE. 45 Fart IV. j Glandula Lacrymalis. « The Glandula Lacrymalis, called, till of late years, 1 the Glandula Innominata Galeni, is situated within the ' Orbit, upon the upper and outer part of the Eye, in a 1 hollow behind the outer end of the Superciliary Ridge < of the Frontal Bone.—It is a Gland of the Conglome- ; rate kind, of a yellowish white colour, of an oblong I form, and a little flattened, with one end pointing to the Nose, the other to the outer Angle of the Eye. Besides the Glandula Lacrymalis, there is a chain of mailer Glands, lying between it and the upper Eye-lid, and connecting them together. In the direction of the smaller Glands, there are six or seven Excretory Ducts,-—described by Dr Monro, 1758,—which run nearly parallel to, but do not com- municate with each other. The Excretory Ducts, on account of their smallness, are not often seen, and are injecfed with difficulty. They terminate on the inner side of the upper Eye-lid, near the outer Angle of the Eye and upper edge of the Tar- sus. The use of the Lacrymal Gland is to secrete the Tears, which are spread over the Surface of the Eye by their own weight, and by the motion of the Eye-lids, for the purpose of preserving the delicacy of the Eye, and particularly the transparency of the Cornea.

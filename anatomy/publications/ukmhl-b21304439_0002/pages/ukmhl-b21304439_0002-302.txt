tm OF THE VISCERA, &c. [Part IV. to left, and frequently form short Coils upon themselves. Sometimes there is a Knot upon the Cord. The Cord is covered by a smooth Coat, derived from the Membranes. Neither Lymphatics nor Nerves have ever been demonstrated in it. The Trunks of the Vessels are inclosed in a Ge- latinous, Ropy, Cellular Substance, which adds to the strength and elasticity of the Cord, and allows the Blood to pass freely between the Foetus and Placenta, without being in danger of interruption from pressure. The Vein is much larger than the Arteries, its area being about equal to the area of both of these. It is destitute of Valves, and sends off no Branches till it reach the Foetus. It arises from the Substance of the Placenta, and, after perforating the Umbilicus, it passes in the inferior part of the Ligamentum Suspcnsorium, to the under side of the Liver. The Arteries arise from the Iliac Arteries of the Foe- tus, perforate the Umbilicus, and run to the Placenta, in the Substance of which they divide into their ulti- mate Branches. Here the one Artery frequently forms a large Anastomosis with the other, and the Ramifica- tions of the Arteries communicate with those of the Vein, in the manner Arteries and Veins do in other parts of the Body. The Cord, by means of the Vein, conveys pure Blood from the Placenta for the nourishment of the Foetus, and, through the Medium of the Arteries, returns what is not used in Nutrition, again to be mixed with the Blood

til* OF THE VISCERA, &c. [Part IV. rior than towards its lateral parts,—a little more capa- cious, also, below than above, especially at its posterior part. It is distinguished into Fundus, Body, and Cervix ; the first of which is placed upwards and a little for- wards, and the last at the under and fore part. It is connected below to the Rectum, and at the sides to tho Pelvis, by the reflected Peritoneum and Cellular Substance ; the former of which, when the Bladder is empty, has the appearance of lateral Ligaments. It is attached, at the fore part of its Body, by Cellu- lar Substance, to the Ossa Pubis, without the interven- tion of the Peritoneum. It is also fixed to the Umbilicus by three Ligaments situated between the Peritoneum and Abdominal Mus- cles.—They are formed of the Urachus running up- wards from the Fundus, and of the shrivelled Umbi- lical Arteries passing obliquely from the sides of the Bladder. The firmest connection is by means of a Ligamentous Expansion, which runs from each side of the Neck of the Bladder and Prostate Gland, to be fixed to the under and inner part of the Symphysis of the Ossa Pubis.— It is connected, also, at this place, to the Penis, by the Urethra. It is composed of different Coats joined together by Cellular Substance ; the first of which is only a partial one continued from the Peritoneum. The Peritoneal, or Common Coat, recedes from the Abdominal Muscles at the top of the Pubes, and passes over the superior, and down upon the posterior and la- teral

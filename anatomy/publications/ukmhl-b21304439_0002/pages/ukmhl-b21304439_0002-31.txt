V Part IV.] OF THE BRAIN. 19 The Veins of this Membrane are of two kinds. One set of them, like the Veins in other parts of the Body, accompany the Arteries ;—the others are termed Sinuses, and differ from Veins only in this, that their Transverse Sections are of a triangular Figure, and that they are inclosed in a doubling of the Dura Mater, which is so tense over them, as to be little affected by the pressure of the surrounding parts. In the bottom of the Sinuses are small Transverse Cords, termed Chordae Willisii, which may add a little to their strength, and assist in preventing them from being too much distended. The Sinuses serve to carry the Blood from the Brain, and convey it to the Veins of the Neck ; for which pur- pose they are properly fitted, their Covering from the Dura Mater giving them strength, and their frequent communications preventing congestion. The Principal Sinuses are, I. The Superior Longitudinal Sinus, which begins at the Crista Galli of the Ethmoid Bone, runs along the upper edge of the Falx, becomes gradually larger in its progress, and terminates in the lateral Sinuses. II. The Torcular Herophili, or Fourth Sinus of the An- cients ;—the term Torcular applied from a supposition that the blood is squeezed in this Sinus as in a Wine- press.—It is chiefly formed of the Vena Galeni, runs be- tween the Falx and Tentorium, and terminates with the former Sinus in the beginning of the lateral Sinuses.

122 OF THE VISCERA, &c. [Part IV. pressure on their points during Manducation. They have thinner Enamel than the other Teeth. The first of the Molares of the Under Jaw has five, and each of the other has four points. Each has two roots, one placed forwards, the other backwards, and these are flat and broad, their flat Sur- faces facing anteriorly and posteriorly. Sometimes there are three roots. In the Upper Jaw, the first Molaris has four, and each of the others only three points. In the two anterior Molares of the Upper Jaw, there are generally three roots, of which two are on the outer side ; the third is on the inner side, and placed oblique- ly, and is the largest and roundest of the three. Some- times, though rarely, there are four roots. The Molares above have a perpendicular direction in respect to the Jaw, those below have an inclination in- wards, which should be attended to by Dentists in the extraction of the Teeth. The backmost Molares are termed Dentes Sapicnticc, from appearing later than the rest of the Teeth. They arc smaller than the other Molares, and have generally fewer roots; these are often quite indistinct, a6 if squeezed together; and frequently there is oidy a single Fang. The Dentes Sapientiae of the Under Jaw have fre- quently curved roots, and are sometimes placed so ob- liquely inwards, as scarcely to appear beyond the Gums. The Incisores of the Upper Jaw being for the most part much broader than those of the under , one, the other

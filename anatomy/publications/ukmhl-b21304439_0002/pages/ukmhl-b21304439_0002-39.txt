Paut IV.] OF THE BRAIN. 27 t and outwards, after which they are elongated, to form the two white Cords, termed Tractus Optici. In the Groove between the Corpora Striata and Tha- lami, there is a Medullary Band on each side, called Centrum Semicirculare Geminum of\ieussens, or Tee- ilia Semicircularis of Haller, or simply Taenia. Over the Thalami is placed the Choroid Plexust nam- ed from its being composed of a Chorus of Vessels and Membranes. It is a fine Vascular Web, consisting of small ramifications of Arteries and Veins, connected by the Pia Mater, and spread upon the Surface of the Thalami, and some of the adjacent parts. The Choroid Plexus frequently contains numerous round Globules, resembling Hydatids, which have been considered by some Authors as Lymphatic Glands. Under the Raphe of the Corpus Callosum is placed the Septum Lucidum, which, when viewed laterally, is observed to be broad before, curved at its edge, and to become gradually narrower towards its posterior extre- mity. 1 It is connected above to the Corpus Callosum, below to the Fornix, and forms a distinct Partition between the Lateral Ventricles. It is composed of two Cineritious and Medullary La- mince, more or less separated from each other at their fore part, by a small Cavity, called Fissure, or Fossa of Sylvius, or Sinus of the Septum Lucidum. This Ca- vity is considered by some as a fifth Ventricle. It does not, however, communicate with the other Ventricles, though in some subjects it reaches a considerable way backwards, and, as well as the other Cavities of the Brain,

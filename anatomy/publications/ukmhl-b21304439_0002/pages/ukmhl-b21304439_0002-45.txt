Near, or in the Substance of the Pineal Gland, small Calcareous Concretions are frequently found, called by Soemmerring, Acervulus Cerebri, from their being ge- nerally found collected in a heap. They do not appear to be the effects of disease ; nor are they met with till after the age of Puberty. Cerebellum. i The Cerebellum is situated in the Inferior Fossce of the Occipital Bone, under the posterior Lobes of the Brain, and is separated from these Lobes by the Tentorium. It is somewhat of a roundish form, though a little broader from one side to the other than from before backwards. It is only about a fifth or sixth part of the size of the Cerebrum, and less complex. It is divided behind by the Falx Minor into two Lobes or Hemispheres, but has no separation above like that of the Brain. Its Surface is divided into numerous Circumvolutions, which form Arches in many parts, decussating each other at sharp angles. The Circumvolutions run chiefly in a lateral direction, and are formed of Laminae, with deep Sulci between them, into which, as in the Brain, the Pia Mater insi- nuates itself. This may be readily seen by making a Puncture into the Arachnoid Coat, and blowing in Air, Vol. IL C till

OF THE VISCERA, &c. [Paht IV. 200 Os Ilium, it terminates by a Valve in the left side of the beginning of the Colon. Through the whole of this course, the Jejunum and Ilium are fixed to the Spine by a continuation of the Mesentery. Great Intestines. The Great, like the Small Intestines, form one con- tinued Canal, which tapers from its upper to near its under extremity; but they differ from them in being considerably wider, shorter, and straighter, in being irregular in their outer Surface, ajid tacked up into Cells, and in having many Processes upon them, termed Appendiculac Pinguedinosee. Like the Small Intestines, also, they are divided into three parts, termed Caecum, Colon, and Rectum. The Intestinum Caecum forms a round short Bag, only about three or four fingers-breadth in length, and near- ly the same in diameter. The Caecum, properly so call- ed, is that part of the Intestine which lies under the in- sertion of the Ilium, though frequently the dilated be- ginning of the Colon is distinguished by the same name. It is situated in the Right Iliac Region, resting on the Cavity of the corresponding Os Ilium, at the under end of the Right Kidney, and is concealed by the last Con- volutions of the Ilium. The bottom of it is turned downwards, and forms a short Sac the mouth of which is directed towards the Colon, and may be considered as forming the Caecum Caput Colli. At

18 OF THE VISCERA, &c. JTart IV. The outer edges to the Ridges and great Angles of the Tem- poral Bones, and terminates at the posterior Clinoid Process of the Sphenoid Bone. Between the middle and inner edges of the Tentorium and posterior Clinoid Process of the Sphenoid Bone, there is a large Notch, or Foramen Ovale, where the Cerebrum and Cerebellum are united, or where the Tuber Annulare is chiefly situated. The Tentorium keeps the Falx tense, and forms a Floor or Vault over the Cerebellum, which prevents the Cerebrum from pressing upon it. III. The F a lx Minor, or Septum Cerehelli, which is placed between the Lobes of the Cerebellum. It de- scends from the under and back part of the Falx and middle of the Tentorium, adheres to the inferior Lon- gitudinal Spine of the Os Occipitis, and terminates in- sensibly at the edge of the Foramen Magnum of that Bone. Besides the Processes of the Dura Mater already de- scribed, there are four of inferior consideration, two of which are situated at the sides of the Sella Turcica, and two at the edges of the Foramina Lacera. Several other Processes pass out at the different open- ings of the Cranium, to be connected to the Pericra- nium, or to accompany the Spinal Marrow and Nerves. â€”These of the last description shall be afterwards taken notice of. The Arteries of the Dura Mater are derived chiefly from the External Carotids, and partly from the Inter- nal Carotids and Vertcbrals.

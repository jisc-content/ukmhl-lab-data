OF THE VISCERA, &c. [Part IV. 6* The liquor of which the Vitreous Humour is composed, is similar to the Aqueous,â€”very fluid, transpires readily through the Capsule, though that Coat be entire, and, like the Aqueous Humour, is somewhat thicker, heavier, and more viscid than Water. When this Humour is evacuated by puncture, in the living Body, it is very seldom, though sometimes re- newed. i Upon the Surface of this Humour there is a Cout, termed Vitrea, or Hyaloidea, from its resemblance to Glass, as transparent as the Humour itself, and so thin and Cobweb-like, as to have also the name of Aranea. The Tunica Vitrea is remarkably smooth on its outer Surface ; excepting at its fore part, where it is impress- ed by the Corpus Ciliare and Pigmcntum Nigrum ; but within, it sends Processes into the Body of the Humour, of the same nature with the external Membrane. Some Authors, and among these Winslow, have described this Coat as consisting of two Lamina;; but Sabatiuu, and other late Writers, seem sufficiently satisfied that it is a single Layer $ and even this single Layer cannot be raised but with difficulty, though it is demonstrable by making a puncture to allow the Hu- mour to escape, and by afterwards distending the part with air. The structure of the Humour consists of a set of de- licate Cells, which contain the Liquor within them, as may be seen by the assistance of Acids, or by boiling Water, or by Congelation. The Cells of the Humour communicate freely with each

SB OF THE VISCERA, &c. [Part IV. the central Pillar, and is that Cavity seen in the bot- tom or outer extremity of the Meatus Auditorius In- terims. It lodges the Branch of the Portio Mollis of the Se- venth Pair of Nerves which goes to the Cochlea, and is Cribriform, or full of small Holes, for the passage of the Twigs of that Branch. The Modiolus consists of /ico Plates, with numerous Cells and Passages between them, and terminates in the middle of the second Gyrus of the Cochlea. The Infundibulum is an imperfect Funnel, the Apex of which is common with that of the Modiolus, and the _ Base is covered by the Apex of the Cochlea, which is termed Cupola. Between the Scalar of the Cochlea there is a Parti? lion, called Lamina Spiralis, or Septum Scalec; the larger portion of which, next the Modiolus, is formed of Bone; the remainder, or that part next the opposite side of the Scalrn, is composed of a Cartilaginous Membrane, and termed by Valsalva Zona Cochlea\—This drops out by maceration, so as afterwards to leave only a par- tial Septum. The Osseous part of the Lamina Spiralis is composed of two extremely thin Cribriform Plates, which gradual- ly approach each other at their opposite edges, where they arc perforated by numerous Holes. The termination of the Lamina Spiralis, and of the Scala Tympani, forms a Hamulus, or small Hook, which projects into the Infundibulum. One of the Canals or Scalmof the Cochlea opens into • the

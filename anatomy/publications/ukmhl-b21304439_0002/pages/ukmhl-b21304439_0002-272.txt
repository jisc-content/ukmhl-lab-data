264 OF THE VISCERA, &c. [Taut IV. —including nearly the space of a finger’s-breadth,— the Urinary passage is entirely Membranous, and covered only with the common Cellular Substance. At the upper side of the Bulb, the Urethra enters the Corpus Spongiosum, in which it is inclosed to its termi- nation in the point of the Penis. The inside of the Urethra is lined by a very Vascular and sensible Membrane, continued from the inner Coat of the Bladder, but which is observed to possess a cer- tain degree of Contractility, and is therefore presumed by several Anatomists to be endowed with Muscular Fibres. Between the Corpus Spongiosum and Membrane which lines the Urethra, especially towards the Septum Penis, numerous Lacuna: of different sizes are situated j one or two of which in particular, next the Gians, are often considerably larger than the rest. They run in a longitudinal direction from behind for- wards, and, perforating the Urethra by Orifices large enough to admit a Bristle, they discharge a Bland Mu- cus for the defence of the Urethra. Besides the Lacunae, two small Bodies of a yellowish colour, each about the size of a Garden-pea, are fre- quenth met with, and are termed, from their Discover- er, Cowpeh’s Glands. They have likewise the name of Antiprostata and Prostata Inferiores. They are situated at the sides of the Membranous part of the Urethra,—between its Bulb and the point of the Prostate Gland,—and covered by the Acceleratores Urinap. Each

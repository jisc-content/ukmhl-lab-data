The Osseous Parts of the Mouth are,—the Ossa Maxillaria Superior a, the Ossa Palati, the Maxilla In- ferior, and the Teeth;—all of which, except the Teeth, have been already described. The Soft Parts of the Mouth consist of the Lips and Cheeks, the Gums, the Palate, the Velum Palati, the Uvula, the Tongue, the Membrane lining the Mouth, and the Salivary Glands. The Lips and Cheeks, which are principally composed of Muscles, are covered on the outside by the common Integuments, and lined within by the Membrane of the Mouth, under which there are numerous Mucous Glands, obtaining their names from their situations. The intervening space between the Masseter and Buc- cinator is occupied by a large quantity of Fat, which gives form to the Face.

181 Part IV.] OF THE THORAX. known to be entirely of the Lymphatic kind,—the Ab- sorbents of the Lungs passing through them in their way to the Thoracic Duct. The Trachea is furnished with Blood-vessels from the [Inferior Laryngeals, and Nerves from the Recurrents, .and Great Sympathetic Pair. The Trachea serves to convey Air into, or out from, the Cells of the Lungs, during Respiration, and to .carry off the Perspirable Matter from the Arteries in •Jthe time of Expiration. The Blood-vessels of the Lungs consist of the Pulmo- .nary and Bronchial Vessels; the one for the general cir- culation, the other proper to the Lungs. The Pulmonary Blood-vessels have been already taken notice of in page 165. Here it may be proper to ob- serve, that the minute Branches of the Artery, running i n the common Cellular Substance of the Lungs, form .it last a Plexus upon the proper Cells, sometimes called Pete Mirahilc, vel Pete Vascidosum Malpighi. Part >i>f this Plexus terminates in the Cells, and their corre- sponding Bronchi, by Exhalent Vessels, from which ihat Halitus is derived which is expelled by the Lungs :n Expiration. The Pulmonary Veins are commonly observed to be imaller, in proportion to the corresponding Arteries, lhan Veins are to Arteries in other parts of the Body, .’hick has been supposed to be owing to the large quan- tity of Fluids expired. The Bronchial Arteries arise by three or four small Branches \ one of which is from one of the right Supe- ior Intercostal?, the rest from the Trunk of the Aorta. M 3 They

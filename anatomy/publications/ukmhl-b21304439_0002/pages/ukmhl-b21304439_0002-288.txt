The Opening between the two Labia has the name of Fossa Magna.—It increases a little in size and depth as it descends, and forms a small boat-like Cavity at its under extremity, termed Fossa Navicularis. The Labia are thickest above, becoming thinner be- low, and terminate in a transverse Fold of the Skin, named Frccnum, Furcula, or Fourchette, which is fre- quently lacerated in the first Delivery.

Between the upper ends of the Labia, is the Substance named Clitoris, and by some Mentula Muliebris,—not extending an inch in length, and little more than the third part of that in thickness, and tied down to the fore part of the Symphysis Pubis. It is extremely Vascular and Nervous, and is com- posed, like the Penis in the Male, of two Crura and Corpora Cavernosa, which are occasionally distended with Blood, and are contained in a Ligamentous Sheath, with a Septum between them.

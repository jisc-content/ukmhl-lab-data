3S OF THE VISCERA, &c. [Part IV. and a large proportion of Cineritious Matter within, joined together by Medullary Fibres. The Brain is the Grand and Primary Organ of Sense 'with which the Mind is supposed to be most imme- diately and intimately connected, and from which the Ner- vous Influence is found, by experiment, to be communicated to all the other parts of the Body. Origin of the Nerves. The Nerves arise from the Medullary parts of the Brain, some in solid Cords, others in separate Threads, which afterwards unite into Cords, and have their names in numerical succession, according to their situations,â€” beginning anteriorly. The First, or Olfactory Pair of Nerves, arise from the back part of the anterior Lobes of the Brain, and run towards the Crista Galli of the Ethmoid Bone, over which each forms a brownish-coloured Bulb, from whence numerous small Nerves are sent off. The Second Pair, or Optic Nerves, are the continua- tion of the Thalami Optici. They are united imme- diately before the Infundibulum, and form an intimate intermixture of parts, and again separate, previous to their passing into the Orbits. The Third Pair arise by numerous Threads, which are soon collected into Trunks. The Fourth Pair, which are the smallest Nerves of the Body, arise behind the Testes, and have a long winding course. The Fifth Pair, which are the largest Nerves in the. Brain,

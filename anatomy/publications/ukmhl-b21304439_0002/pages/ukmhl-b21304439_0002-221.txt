215 Part IV.] OF THE ABDOMEN. Contents of the Small into the Large Intestines, but completely prevents their return. The Colon is of a similar structure with the Caecum. .—The inner Surface is smooth.—The Longitudinal Muscular Fibres are collected upon it into three Fasci- culi or Bands, which arise at the root of the Vermiform Process, and are continued along the Colon to the Rectum. The Longitudinal Bands are shorter than the rest of the Colon, and of course assist in contracting it, and forming it into Plicae, which lie across lhe Gut, answering to the Valvulae Conniventes ; only they are at a greater distance from each other, and much larger; dividing the Colon into little apartments, called Cells. The Cells of the Colon, with their Partitions, have a threefold order, the Intestine being almost quite smooth ®r plain, opposite to the Longitudinal Bands. The Cells assist in preventing the too rapid descent <«f the Faeces. The Colon receives the Excrementitious parts of the Aliment, retains them, changes them into Faeces, and i then, by the Peristaltic motion of the Intestines and | power of Respiration, pushes them, by slow degrees, to Ithe Rectum. The Rectum differs from the Colon in being covered •only anteriorly and laterally by the Peritoneum:—Its Muscular Fibres are stronger and thicker, and spread iuniformly over the Intestine. The Circular Fibres are :S0 thick at the end ol the Rectum, as to have been mamed Internal Sphincter. It has no Cells like the Colon; but the Cellular and Q 8 Inner

Part IV.] OF THE ABDOMEN. 225 mite towards the Cervix, where they run in a longitu- dinal direction. Tlio Surface of this Coat is every where perforated by the Ducts of small Follicles, which discharge a Viscid Mucus, to defend it from the Stimulant nature of the Bile. The Gall-Bladder is connected through its whole length to the Liver by Cellular Substance, Biood-vessels, and Absorbents. In many Brute-Animals, the Gall-Bladder is connect- ed to the Liver also by a set of Ducts, called Hepato- Cystic, which convey the Bile found in the Gall-Bladder immediately from the Liver. No such Ducts, however, are demonstrable in the Human Body, though, in for- mer times, the contrary has been maintained by diffe- rent Authors. The Gall-Bladder has Blood-vessels, Absorbents, and Nerves, in common with those of the Liver.â€”Its Veins pass into the Vena Portae. The Cervix or Neck of the Gall-Bladder is twisted and folded against itself, and afterwards contracts and sends out a Duct called Cysticus, which runs near the Ductus Hfpoticus, and then joins it, at a sharp Angle, to form the Ductus Communis Choledochus. The Ductus Cysticus is smaller than the Ductus Hepa- h'cus, and differs from it also in having a number of im- perfect Partitions or Plica?, running in a somewhat spi- ral direction, and forming it into Ceils, which retard the flow of the Bile. The Gall-Bladder serves as a Receptacle for the Bile, when the Stomach and Intestines are empty, and have VoL. II. P BO

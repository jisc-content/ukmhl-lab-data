Fart IV.] ORGANS OF GENERATION. 277 They are deepest, largest, and most crowded upon the anterior and towards the outer part of the Vagina; are most conspicuous in Virgins, less so in married Women, and become more and more effaced in those who have born Children.—The Rugae augment the Friction dur- ing Coition, and facilitate the distension of the Vagina during Child-birth. The whole extent of the Vagina, particularly towards its outer extremity, is furnished with small Follicles, the Orifices of which can frequently be seen. They supply a Mucus, with which the Canal is always lubricated, and which is discharged, in time of Coition, in such abundance, as to have been formerly considered as an emission of Female Semen. The outer end oi the Vagina is covered, on each side, by a Substance composed of Blood-vessels and Cells si- milar to those of the Penis, and described by De Graaf under the name of Plexus Retcformis, and by later Ana- tomists, under that of Corpus Cavernosum Vogiv.ce. The Corpora Cavernosa are covered by the Sphincter Vagin®, the action of which, joined to the Dilatation of these Bodies, serves to contract the entry of the Vagina in the time of Coition. The Vagina receives the Penis and Semen, and con- veys from the Uterus the Menstrual Flux, the Foetus, the Secundines, and the Lochia. The Uterus, with its Ligaments, Ovaria, and Ute- rine Tubes, are supplied with Blood from the Sperma- tic and Uterine Arteries. The Spennatic Arteries arise from the Aorta, and, afi in the Male, descend for some way through the Abdo- S 3 men.

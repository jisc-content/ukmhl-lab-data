OF THE VISCERA, &e. [Part IV, H2 The They differ in size in different people, have Mucous Follicles opening into them, and arc found to be service- able in the modulation of the Voice. On the anterior Surface of the Arytenoid Cartilages, there is a small Depression, filled by a Glandular Body, which not only covers the fore part of these Cartilages, but is continued over the posterior extremities of the Ligaments of the Glottis. The Arytenoid Glands arc larger in some Subjects than in others. They were discovered, and are parti- cularly described and delineated, by Morgagni. The Ligaments which connect the Epiglottis to the Notch of the Thyroid Cartilage, and to the under side of the Os Hyoides, together with one whieh ties the Base of the Os Hyoides, form a Triangular space t which is also occupied by Cellular Substance and by Mucous Glands. In a Woman, the Larynx is proportionally smaller than in a Man, and the Thyroid Cartilage projects less in the fore part of the Throat. The Cavity of the Larynx is lined by a Membrane which is extremely irritable, and is every where perfo- rated by the Mouths of small Mucous Glands, for the purpose of moistening it. The Larynx has a number of Museles, for its different motions ; all of which have been already described. The Arteries of the Larynx are the two Superior La- ryngeals, which come from the External Carotids, and the two Inferior Laryngeals, which are sent off from the Subclavian Arteries.

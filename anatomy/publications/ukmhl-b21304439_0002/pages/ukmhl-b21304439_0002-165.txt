Part IV.] OF THE THORAX. 153 the tercepted by the Heart and root of the Lungs, and di- vides the Thorax into two distinct Cavities, which have no communication with each other. It is formed by a reflection of the Pleura, and is of course double, and contains between its Layers a consi- derable quantity of Cellular Substance, by which they are united. It is divided into Anterior and Posterior Mediastinum, the former of which is situated at the fore, and the lat- ter at the back part of the Thorax. The Anterior Mediastinum is connected before to the Sternumj and behind, to the Pericardium and large Vessels of the Heart. The tw'o Layers of the Anterior Mediastinum arc closely applied to each other, excepting at the upper part of the Thorax, where they are separated by the remains of the Thymus Gland. At the upper part of the Thorax, it lies exactly be- hind the middle of the Sternum ; but in its descent, it inclines gradually to the left edge of that Bone. In consequence of its obliquity, a pointed instrument, pushed through the centre of the Sternum, is generally found to pass into the right Cavity of the Thorax. Frequent deviations, however, from this general rule have been met with.â€”In particular, Lieutaud and Sa- batier relate several instances where the Anterior Me- diastinum was found to descend alon^ the middle of the Sternum 5 and others, though .rare, where it descended even to the right side of this Bone. ri he Posterior Mediastinum reaches from the root of

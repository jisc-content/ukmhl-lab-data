The Bronchi, at their beginnings, have the same kind ot Cartilages with the Trachea ; but after they enter the Lungs, each Cartilaginous Ring is divided into two or three pieces, which, however, are so connected to each other, as to go completely round the Bronchi, and keep the Passage open and free from compression. Upon tracing the smaller divisions of the Bronchi, the Cartilages are observed to become less numerous, and more separated from each other, till at length they vanish; the Capillary Branches becoming entirely Mem- branous, as well as the Vesicles in which thev termi- * nate.

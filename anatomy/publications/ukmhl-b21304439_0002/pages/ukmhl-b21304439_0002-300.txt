OF THE VISCE RA, &c. [Part IV. 292 and Vagina j this comes away before Parturition, the Follicles which form it, throwing out, afterwards, a thinner fluid, to lubricate the parts. The situation of the Appendages of the Uterus is also considerably altered. The Ovaria, with the Tubes and Ligaments of the Uterus, are situated lower, in respect to the Fundus Uteri, in proportion as it ascends. At the full time, they lie close upon the Surface, and the broad Ligaments, by assisting in forming a covering to the Uterus, are nearly obliterated. The Tubes descend by the sides of the Uterus, and are thicker and more Vascular, and have the Fimbriae more expanded than formerly. In the enlarged state of the Uterus, the Muscular Fibres, though pale, are distinctly seen.—They form Fasciculi which run in various directions, but cannot be traced far without interruption. They are variously described by different Authors ; their course, however, is such, that they are capable of contracting the Uterus in ail its dimensions during the time of Delivery. A description is given by Ruysch of a Circular Muscle in the bottom of the Uterus, for the expulsion of the Placenta ;—but the Placenta is found to adhere to other parts besides the Fundus Uteri; nor has such a Muscle been observed by later Anatomists. In Hun- ter’s Plates the Fibres are seen running transversely in the Body of the Uterus, and describing Concentric Circles about the Orifices of the Fallopian Tubes. The Muscular Fibres of the Uterus assist in the De- livery of the Child and expulsion of the Placenta; and in a few weeks after Delivery, the Uterus, partly by the contractile

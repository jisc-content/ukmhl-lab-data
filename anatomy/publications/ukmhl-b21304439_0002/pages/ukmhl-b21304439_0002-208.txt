OF THE VISCERA, &c. [Part IV. 196 the Plica; of the Esophagus, and have a radiated ap- pearance at the Cardia. The Rugae of the Stomach, like the Plica? of the Eso- phagus, are most distinct when the Stomach is empty ; —when it is full, they are much less evident. They admit of distension without endangering the Vessels and Nerves dispersed in them, and assist a little in detaining the Aliment till properly digested. From the inner Surface of the Stomach, a Liquor issues, which is found to approach to the nature of Sa- liva, and is termed Gastric Juice.—This was formerly supposed to come from Glands seated in the Third Coat, but is now more frequently considered as a Secretion from the Arteries of the Stomach, no Glands being evident there, at least in the sound state of this Viscus, unless we consider the Villi as such. The Arteries of the Stomach are derived from the Coeliac Artery. They consist of the Superior Gastric, which supplies the place next the small Curvature; of the Right Inferior Gastric, which is a Branch of the He- patic *, of the Pyloric Arteries, which are small Branches from the Gastrics and from the Hepatic; and of the Left Gastric and Arterice Breves, which are Branches of the Splenic Artery. When the Arteries arrive at the small Curvature of the Stomach, they separate into two Layers; the inner is spread out upon the Nervous Coat, and is distributed to the Villi by Filaments, which form a most delicate Plexus. The External Layer is expanded under the Peritoneal Coat, supplying it and the Muscular one with

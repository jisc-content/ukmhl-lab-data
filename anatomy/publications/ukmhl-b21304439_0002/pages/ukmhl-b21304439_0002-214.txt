OF THE VISCERA, &c. [Part IV. ?0<5 posed become more or less incorporated, and Cribriform or Reticular, and varies much in its extent and gene- ral appearance in different bodies. The Anterior Layer is a continuation of the Perito- neal Coats, produced from the upper and under Sur- faces of the Stomach. This Production arises from the whole length of the large Arch of the Stomach, and beginning of the Duo- denum ; its origin extending as far as the Spleen. It descends commonly a little below the Umbilicus, espe- cially in fat people; sometimes, however, it does not reach this depth, at other times it is found as low as the Pubes, but without adhering to tlie Abdominal Muscles, behind which it is situated. Its under edge is reflected, to form the posterior Layer, which ascends without adhering to the Small Intestines over which it is spread, till it reaches the Arch of the Colon, to the greater part of which Arch, and to the Vessels of the Spleen, it is connected. The Omentum Colicunj, which is merely an Appendix of the Omentum, arises from the right part of the Arch of the Colon, in the same manner as the other part of the Omentum arises from the Stomach, and sends down- wards and to the right side a Cuneiform Process, which is connected with the Colon Dextrum as far as the Cae- cum. Besides the Omentum, there is a Membrane much smaller, situated between the Liver and Stomach, term- ed Omentum Hepato-gastricum, or Omentum Minus of Winslow, or Mcmbrana Macilentioi- of Haller, from its having little Fat in it. \ It

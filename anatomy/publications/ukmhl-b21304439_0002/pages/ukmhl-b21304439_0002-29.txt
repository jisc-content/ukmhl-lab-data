17 Part IV.] OF THE BE.AIN. I. The Falx, Septum Cerebri, ox* Superior Longitu- dinal Process, which is formed by a doubling of the Dura Mater, and is situated between the Hemispheres of the Brain. It begins at the middle of the Sphenoid Bone, arid Crista Galli of the Ethmoid Bone, and runs along the upper and middle part of the Head, adhering first to the Frontal, then to the joining of the Parietal, and afterwards to the middle of the Occipital Bone. In its passage, it becomes gradually broader, extends from the Cranium to near the Corpus Callosum, and terminates behind in the middle of the Tentorium. It runs from behind forwards in a straight direction, and has some resemblance in shape to a Sickle or Scythe, from which circumstance it has obtained the name of Falx. Between the under edge of the Falx and Base of the Cranium, there is a large space of an ovalform, occu- pied by that part of the Brain which is common to the two Hemispheres. The Falx supports the Tentorium, and is considered as preventing the two sides of the Brain from pressing upon each other, though there have been instances where part, or even the whole, of this Process has been wanting. II. The Tentorium Cerebelli, or Transverse Sep- tum, or Lateral Processes of the Dura Mater. I he Tentorium is continued laterally from the Falx, is connected behind to the inner Transverse Ridges and Grooves of the Occipital Bone, and at the fore and Vol. II. B outer

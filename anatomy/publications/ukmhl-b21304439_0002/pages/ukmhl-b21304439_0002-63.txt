Part IV.] 51- OF THE EYE. i Tunica Sclerotica. The Tunica Sclerotica, which is named from its hard- ness, is the largest and strongest Coat of the Eye, cover- ing the whole Ball, excepting the parts occupied by the entrance of the Optic Nerve behind, and by the Cornea before. It is so firmly fixed to the edge of the Cornea, that it has been considered by many Anatomists as a continua- tion of the same substance ; but it differs from the Cor- nea in the following particulars :â€”it is of a pure white colour ; is formed of Fibres running in every direction, and closely interwoven with each other, and is not divi- sible into Layers. It is thicker in its posterior than anterior part, and receives a little tinge, on the inner Surface, from the Choroid Coat, with which it is in contact. It gives form and strength to the Eye, attachment to its Muscles, and protects and supports the tender parts it incloses. It has also been conjectured, and Blumen- bach thinks he has ascertained, from comparative Ana- tomy, the truth of the conjecture, that this Coat, by its structure, is so affected by the action of the Muscles, as to influence what are called the Internal Changes of the Eye: by which the form of the Eye-ball, conse- quently the length of its Axis, and the respective situa- tion oi the Lens, are adjusted according to the proxi- mity or remoteness of the object.

Part IV.] OF THE THORAX. 157 the small degree, according to the position of the Body, and state of Respiration. Though this be the common situation of the Heart, a few rare and singular instances have occurred, where it has been found to occupy the right side of the Thorax ; and a displacement has sometimes happened, in conse- quence of different kinds of Tumours in the left side of the Thorax. The Superior or Anterior Surface of the Heart is con- vex, and is opposed to the posterior Surface of the Ster- num ; the anterior edges of the Lungs intervening. The Inferior or Posterior Surface is flat, and rests upon the Tendon of the Diaphragm which supports it. The Heart is not much affected, however, by the mo- tions of that Muscle in time of Respiration ; its Tendon moving only in a small degree. The right side of the Body of the Heart is sharp, and is called Margo Acutus. The left side is round, and is termed Margo Obiusus. The Base is formed of a Right and Left Auricle, and the Body of a Right and Left Ventricle. When the Heart is distended, the Right Auricle, and part of the corresponding Ventricle, occupy the right, and the rest of the Heart the left Cavity of the Thorax. The Heart is connected above and behind to the upper and back part of the Thorax, through the Medium of the great Vessels which go into, or pass out from it. The other parts of the Heart are free, being merely contiguous to the inside of the Pericardium. The External Surface of the Heart is covered with a thin, smooth, Membranous Coat, which is a reflection of

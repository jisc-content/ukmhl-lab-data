Like the Cuticle, they are insensible, are renewable after having been separated, and have no evident Ves- sels. They differ from it, however, in structure; being formed of Plates, and the Plates of Longitudinal Fibres, which are closely compacted, as may be seen when they are thoroughly dried, or in a diseased state. They begin by a square root, a little before the last Joints of the Fingers and Toes. When separated from the Skin, they are transparent like Horn, but are coloured in the living Body by the Vessels of the Cutis, to which they adhere, and from which they derive their nourishment.

They grow from the roots, and not from the points; and begin to be formed about the third month of Con- ception.

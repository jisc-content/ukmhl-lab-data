OF THE VISCERA, &c. [Path IV. 116 The Enamel has no Cavity for Marrow, and is so hard, that a Saw or a File impresses it with difficulty. The action of Fire does not much affect its colour. It is almost completely dissolved in the Acids. It is thicker towards the Body, and becomes gradual- ly thinner towards the Cervix of the Tooth. It is composed of Fibres so disposed as to form Radii round the Body of the Tooth j or they are nearly per- pendicular to its Surface. The Fibres are straight on the cutting Edges and grinding Surfaces of the Bodies, but curved at the sides, with their convex part turned towards the Fangs of the Teeth, which better enables them to resist the impression of hard Substances placed between them du- ring Manducation ; nor are they, from this structure, so easily fractured by the inordinate motion of the Jaws. At the point of each of the Roots of the Teeth, there is a Foramen, and a passage leading from it into a common Cavity in the Body of the Tooth, for lodg- ing the Substance called Fid}) of the Teeth. The Foramen is placed towards one side of the point, which prevents the Vessels and Nerves entering frouv being injured by pressure. In old People, the Foramen is sometimes obliterated ; in such cases the Vessels and Nerves arc destroyed. The shape of the Cavity resembles that of the Body of the Tooth, being narrow next the Fangs, and gra- dually expanding towards the opposite extremity. The Cavity has no Cancelli nor Marrow, being filled with

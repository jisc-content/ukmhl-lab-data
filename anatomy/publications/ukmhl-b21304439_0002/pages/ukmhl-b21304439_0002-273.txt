Part IV.] ORGANS OF GENERATION. 265 Each sends out a small Duct, which terminates ob- liquely in the Urethra, at the bulbous part. They are observed to discharge a Fluid, which is sup- posed to serve the same purpose with that of the La- cunae. The Arteries of the Penis are chiefly from the Pudicaj Communes, which are Branches of the Internal Iliacs, and partly from the Femoral Arteries. Each of the Pudic Arteries having passed out of the Pelvis through the great Notch of the Os Ilium, runs between the Sacro-Sciatic Ligaments to the inner side of the Tuber Ischii, from which it passes along the Crus of that Bone and of the Os Pubis, to the root of the Penis. In its course, it furnishes Branches to the adjacent parts, and afterwards gives off three principal Branches, which belong to the Penis :—One of these goes to the Bulb of the Urethra, to be dispersed in the Corpus Spongiosum ;—the other two, which are larger than the former, go to the Body of the Penis ; one of them pene- trating its Crus, and running in the axis of the Corpus Cavernosum, as may be readily seen by a longitudinal section of this part; the other passing between the Symphysis Pubis and joining of the Crura Penis, and extending along the Dorsum as far as the Corona Glandis. The Branches of the Femoral Artery to the Penis communicate with those of the former, and are chiefly dispersed upon the Integuments. The Arteries of the Penis are divided into minute Ramifications, which communicate with each other, and with

Part IV.] OF THE MOUTH, &c. 117 II 3 The with the Pulp, which is inclosed in a fine Membrane, connected to the Tooth by Cellular Substance. The Pulp consists of minute Vessels and Nerves, in- termixed with Gelatinous Matter, the remains of that which gave origin to the Tooth. The Arteries of the Teeth, called Dental, are Branches of the Internal Maxillary; the Veins returning from them pass into the Internal Jugular Veins. After the Arteries have entered the Teeth, they are dispersed upon the Membrane which lines their Cavity, as may be seen by injecting them ;—by the appearance produced by age, the Cavity in old People often filling- up with Osseous Matter, and the Teeth acquiring a horny transparency ;—by accident, as when a Tooth is loosened by a blow, the Tooth being sometimes fixed again in its Socket, at other times becoming black, from its nourishing Vessels being destroyed ;—by disease, as in Anchylosis of the Roots of the Teeth, or in some rare cases, of the Roots of one Tooth to those next it; —but especially by the Blood which is observed by Den- tists to issue from the Cavity of the Teeth in sawing them across, for the purpose of fixing other Teeth. The Nerves of the Teeth are from the Fifth Pair, those of the Teeth of the Upper Jaw being from the Second, and those of the Teeth of the Lower Jaw from the Third Branch of that Pair. In the Upper Jaw, the Nerves enter through various parts of the Ossa Maxillaria Superiora. In the under Jaw, the Trunk which furnishes the Dental Nerves is lodged in the inferior Maxillary Canal.

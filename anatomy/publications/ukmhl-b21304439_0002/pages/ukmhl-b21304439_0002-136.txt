12 If OF THE VISCERA, &c. [Part IV. time of birth, they arc almost closed. In consequence of this, considerable pressure can be made in the time of Suction, without injuring the tender Teeth they con- tain. The Alveoli of the Molares are produced directly be- fore the roots of the Coronoid Processes of the Under Jaw, and in the Bulges or Tubers of the Upper Jaw, and come forwards as the Jaws increase in length and size. In a Foetus of about four Months, small Pulpy Pro- cesses are found to proceed from the inner Surface of the Gums, and to be lodged in the Alveolar Grooves of both Jaws. These are the Rudiments of the future Teeth. At this time they are of a Gelatinous or Pulpy nature, resembling in shape the Bodies of the Teethwhich are to be formed in them ; each contained in a Membranous Capsule proper to itself. By degrees the Pulp becomes firmer, and extremely Vascular, and having increased to near the size of the Body of the Tooth, Bone is deposited upon its extreme points by the Blood-vessels, the Pulp itself continuing to grow for some time after this. About the filth or sixth Month, Bone begins to ap- pear on that part of the Surface which is afterwards to form the cutting Edges and grinding Surfaces, and in as many points as there are Eminences on the Pulp. The Ossification begins in the Incisores at three points, and in the other Teeth at points corresponding with the number of the future points of the Teeth. The Osseous points gradually increase, unite, and form

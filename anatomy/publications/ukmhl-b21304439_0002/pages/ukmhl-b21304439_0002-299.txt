291 Part IV.] ORGANS OF GENERATION. The Arteries in their course are remarkably convo- luted,—fully as much so as they are previous to Con- ception,—and greatly more so than the corresponding Veins. The Veins are much larger than the Arteries, their diameters being such as to have distinguished them by the name of Sinuses;—and to them the great bulk of the Uterus is chiefly owing. The Substance of the Uterus was formerly supposed by some to be thicker, and by others to be thinner in the Gravid, than in the unimpregnated state •, but it appears now to be sufficiently ascertained, that it is nearly of the same thickness in both states, and during the whole term of Pregnancy, unless it be at the end of Gestation, where it becomes thinner towards the under extremity. After the third Month, the Cervix Uteri begins to become softer, wider, and more spongy, and continues to do so till the seventh or eighth Month, when it is completely obliterated. During all this period, the Os Tincae is undergoing similar changes. In proportion as the Cervix stretches, the Tubercle of the Os Uteri becomes less prominent, but its circumference is enlarged. At the latter Months it becomes thin, flat, and irregular on its edges, and the firmness of its texture is converted to the Spongy softness of the Body of the Uterus. Its Orifice is changed from a Transverse Slit into an oval Pit; and in Women who have born several Children, it is consi- derably dilated near the end of Gestation. There is now m.erely the Mucus as a Septum between the Uterus T 2 anti

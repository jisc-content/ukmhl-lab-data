The Hairs serve in general for the ornament, warmth, or protection of the different parts on or near which they are placed. Sebaceous Ducts or Follicles, and Miliary Glands. The Sebaceous Follicles derive their name from the Fluid they contain, becoming like Suet, after acquiring a certain degree of consistency, or being inspissated by stagnation. They are seated under the Cutis, and are found in greatest abundance in those parts which are exposed to the air, or to attrition; as in the Nose, Ears, Nipples, Groins, and external Parts of Generation.

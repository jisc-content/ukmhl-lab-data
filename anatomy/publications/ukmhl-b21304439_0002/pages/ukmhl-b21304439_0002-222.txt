214 OF THE VISCERA, &c. [PartIN*. Inner Coat are so much larger here than they are higher up, as to fall into transverse Folds, which, however, dis- appear in proportion to the distension of the Intestine. The middle and under end of the Rectum has nume- rous large Mucous Glands or Follicles. The extremity of the Rectum forms a firm Circle, which acts as a Valve, and assists the proper Sphincter in preventing the involuntary discharge of the Faeces. The Verge of the Anus is surrounded with deep Fol- licles, the contents of which prevent the tender Skin of the Anus from being excoriated by hard or acrid Faeces. The Anus is also surrounded with a great deal of Fat, which admits of the dilatation of the Rectum, and fa- cilitates the discharge of the Faeces. The Rectum receives the Faeces from the Colon, re- tains them lor a certain time, till, by their weight and acrid nature, it is stimulated.to discharge them ; which it does by the power of its Muscular Coat, and of the Levator Ani, assisted by the action of the Diaphragma** tic anil Abdominal Muscles. The Blood vessels of the Intestines are large and nu- merous, and are derived from different sources. The Duodenum receives Branches from the Splenic and Hepatic Arteries. The Jejunum, Ilium, and right half of the Colon, are supplied by the Superior Mesenteric Artery ; and the left half of the Colon with the Rectum, by the In- ferior Mesenteric Artery. The Veins of all the Intestines send their Blood to the Vena lâ€™ortas. The Absorbents of the Intestines arc large and nume- rous.

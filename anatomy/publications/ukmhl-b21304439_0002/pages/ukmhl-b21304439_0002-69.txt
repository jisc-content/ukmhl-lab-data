57 - OF THE EYE. Part IV.] the Eye, and terminates or disappears upon the ante- rior part of the edge, or greatest diameter of the Cap- sule of the Crystalline Lens. The Retina is contiguous to the Choroid Coat and Capsule of the Vitreous Humour, but docs not, by Blood-vessels or otherwise, adhere to either, till it reach the Corpus Ciliare. Under the Corpus Ciliare, the Retina is so covered externally with the Pigmentum Nigrum, and adheres internally so closely to the Capsule of the Vitreous Hu- mour, as to be prevented from being seen till the black Paint be washed offâ€™, or till all the Coats be removed posteriorly, and the Eye viewed through the medium of the Vitreous Humour. In the back part of the Retina, and on the side next the Choroid Coat, directly in the Axis of the Eye, there is a transparent Spot, which appears like a Foramen, sur- rounded with a yellow Border, which becomes paler to- wards the Circumference. This was first discovered by Soemmerring, and is termed Foramen Cent rale, but its nature is not yet understood. It is said to be peculiar to the Human Species and Ape. According to Blumen- bach, it may serve as a kind of Pupil through which concentric rays may pass, and be absorbed by the Pig- mentum Nigrum of the Choroides, in those Animals which have the Axis of the Eyes parallel to each other, and thereby see objects with both Eyes at once, but are in danger from this of being dazzled by strong light. The Retina is composed of a tender and Pulpy-like Substance, is semi-transparent, and of a light grey co- lour.

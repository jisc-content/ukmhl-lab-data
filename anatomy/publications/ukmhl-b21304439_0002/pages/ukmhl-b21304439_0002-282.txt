OF THE VISCERA, &c. [Part IV 27 * They (Iren. This unequal appearance is greatly owing to the habit of Body, as it is frequently met with in a young Adult Virgin. They are attached to the Uterus by the Ligamenta Lata, and by two small Cords, termed Ligamenta Ro- , tunda Ovarii, which were mistaken by the Ancients for Vasa Deferentia, carrying a secreted Liquor to the U- tcrus. They are composed internally of a loose whitish Cel- lular or Spongy Substance, intermixed with Vessels and Nerves, and contain a number of small Vesicles, called Ova, filled with a limpid Fluid which partakes of the qualities of the white of an Egg. These Vesicles differ much in size in the same Ova- rium ;—the largest of them are seldom equal to the size of a small Garden-pea, and are commonly placed near- est the Surface. The number of Ova is differently estimated by diffe- rent Anatomists;—from ten to twenty and upwards having been found in one Ovarium. According to experiments made by Mr Hunter, it is ascertained,—that the number of originally existing Ova in each Ovarium, whether that number be great or small, may be diminished, but cannot be increased. | ! The Ovaria serve for the nourishment of the Ova, which contain the Rudiments of the Foetus. The Uterine, or Fallopian Tubes, compared in shape, by Fallopius, to that of a Trumpet, are two Conical and Vermiform Canals, attached to the Corners of the Uterus, and terminating in it, each by a small Opening which scarcely admits the entrance of a Bristle.

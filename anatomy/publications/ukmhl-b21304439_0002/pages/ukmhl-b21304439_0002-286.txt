OF THE VISCERA, &c. [PartIV. 27S The men. They run next in the Ligamcnta Lata, to be dispersed upon the Ovaria and Uterine Tubes, and after- wards upon the Fuudus of the Uterus. In the progress of their course, they have a Serpentine appearance. The Uterine Arteries are derived from the Internal Iiiacs, and are much larger than the Spermatics. They diiect their course, first to the under part of the Uterus, after which each splits into the proper Uterine and the Vaginal Arteries. The Uterine Arteries ascend along the edges of the Uterus, and near its upper part join the Spermatic Arteries. The Vaginal Arteries run along the lateral parts of the Inner Portion of the Vagina. Chiefly from the Uterine, and partly from the Sper- matic Arteries, many small Branches are furnished, which run in a Serpentine manner, and communicate with their fellows in the opposite sides of the Uterus, so : s to supply the whole Substance ol that Viscus. The Vagina is supplied on each side by the Vaginal Arteries from the Uterine, and by small Branches from the Umbilical, middle Hamiorrhoidal, and Pudic Arteries. The Spermatic Veins, in passing from the Ovaria and Uterus, form a complicated Plexus, d hey have the same termination as in the Male, but are considerably lamer.â€”The other Veins run into the Internal lliacs. The Lymphatics, like the Blood-vessels, run also in two Sets. Those of the one Set accompany the Sper- matic Blood-vessels, and, like the Absorbents ol the Testes in the Male, go to the Lumbar Glands. Those of the other correspond with the Hypogastric Blood- vessels, and terminate in the Glands at the lateral parts of the Pelvis.

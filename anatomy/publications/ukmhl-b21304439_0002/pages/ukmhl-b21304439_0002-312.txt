30* OF THE VISCERA, &c. [Part IV. In Fortas carries the Blood of the Splenic and Mesenteric Arteries to the Right Lobe of the Liver. Alter Birth, the Left Lobe of the Liver, which was formerly more particularly supplied by the Umbilical Vein, receives an additional proportion of Blood from the Vena Portarum. The reason why the Umbilical Vein goes partly to the Cava, and not entirely to the Heart, is not understood. The Kidneys are irregular on their Surface, being formed of Lobes, the number nearly corresponding with that of the Papillae in the Kidney of the Adult. Each of the Lobes consists of a Cortical, a Medul- lar)' part, and a Papilla, and is covered by a Proper Membrane. The Glandula Renalis is almost as large as the Kidney, but afterwards rather diminishes than increases in size. The Bladder of Urine is of a long form, and extends almost to the Umbilicus. The greater part of it is above the Pelvis, and is more particularly covered by the Peritoneum than in the Adult. The Urachus, which is of a Conical form, ascends from the bottom of the Bladder, between the Umbilical Arteries, anti between the Peritoneum and Linea Alba, to the Umbilicus, and vanishes by degrees in the Umbi- lical Cord. It is formed by a Production of the Fundus Vcsicae, and in the Human Body is a solid Substance, forming a Suspensory Ligament of the Bladder. It has been sometimes found hollow at its beginning, and has been said to be so, in one or two instances, throughout its whole length.

174 OF THE VISCERA, &c. [Fart IV. they arc also observed to be tinged with black spots, proceeding from a matter secreted in their Substance. They are joined to the Neck by the Trachea; to the Spine, by the two Layers of the Mediastinum, which serve them as Ligaments; and to the Heart, by the Pulmonary Vessels; the rest of them being free and unconnected, unless when an adhesion takes place in consequence of Inflammation. They are divided into Right and Left Portions, or Lungs, which are separated from each other by the Heart and Mediastinum, and which have no communi- cation, except through the medium of the Trachea. Each of the Lungs is again divided by Fissures, vary- ing in depth in different Bodies, into large Portions, called Lobes, which facilitates their motion and the dila- tation of their Cells. Of the Lobes, Three belong to the Right Lung, cor- responding with the larger Bag of the Pleura, and Tvco to the Left, between which there is a Notch or Sinus, occupied by the Point of the Heart. Sometimes an ad- ditional Lobe is found in the Left Lung, or the reverse in the Right one; but mistakes may arise in numbering these, in consequence of morbid adhesions. Each of the Lobes is subdivided into many smaller parts, termed Lobules, which are of different sizes, and of an irregular angular form. The Lobules diminish in size, and degenerate at last into small Vesicles or Cells, which constitute a large share of the Lungs. The Cells of the Lungs are purely Membranous, of an irregular figure, but nearly of the same size, com- pressed

262 OF THE VISCERA, &c. [Part IV. Bulb of the Urethra. It extends from the root of the Penis to near the Anus, projects most towards the un- der and back part, and is divided anteriorly by a Sep- tum. â€¢from the Bulb, the Corpus Spongiosum is continued along the under part of the Corpora Cavernosa, in a Cylindrical figure, and at the end of these expands into the Glims Penis, which is of an oval form, and placed obliquely. The Gians covers and incloses the ends of the Corpora Cavernosa. The Gians is separated from the Corpora Cavernosa by a continuation of the Ligamentous Sheath which covers them, and is encircled at its posterior part by a prominent Margin, called Corona Glandis; behind which is a Cervix. The Surface of the Gians is covered with a Plexus chiefly of Venous Vessels, and with Nervous Papillce ; and these are inclosed in the Skin, continued from the inside of the Prepuce, but now become so delicate, that the colour of the Corpus Spongiosum of the Gians ap- pears through it. The Nervous Papillas render the Gians the principal seat of the sensibility of which the Penis is susceptible. About the Cervix and Corona of the Gians, are many Follicles, termed Glandulcc Odorifercc, which discharge a Sebaceous Matter, to preserve the sensibility of the Gians, and allow the Prepuce to move backwards and forwards upon it with facility. The Internal Structure of the Bulb of the Urethra and Gians Penis, is of the same nature with that of the Corpora

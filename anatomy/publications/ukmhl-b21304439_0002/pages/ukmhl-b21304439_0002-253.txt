When the Bladder is much distended, it carries the IPeritoneum with it, and leaves a space between that JMembrane and the Pubes, of such length, that an In- clusion has frequently been made here, and large Calculi extracted from the Bladder, without penetrating into tthe Abdomen, or wounding the Peritoneum. The second Coat is termed Muscular.—It is composed oaf distinct Fleshy Fibres, interwoven with each other, :und forming Fasciculi. The External Fibres run chiefly in a longitudinal di- rection, and are connected, at the under and fore part Dof the Bladder, with the Ossa Pubis.. More internally, are Fibres which run in all directions, and are intermixed with each other in the form of an irregular Net-work. The Muscular Fibres are contracted about the Neck of the Bladder, and form what has been termed Sphincter Wesicce;—these, however, are merely the continuation jjf the other Fibres. The Muscular Coat, by its contraction, occasions the complete evacuation of the Bladder.—The Fibres about he Neck of the Bladder-, by acting separately from the rest of the Muscular Coat, prevent the involuntary dis- charge of the Urine.

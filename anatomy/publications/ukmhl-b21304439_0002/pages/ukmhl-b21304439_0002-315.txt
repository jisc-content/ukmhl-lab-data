0t>7 Part IV.] OF THE FCETUS. Position of the Fcetus. In the first Months, the Embryo swims in the Liquor Amnii, free from the pressure of the surrounding parts; —and from many Dissections and Observations made by the latest Anatomists, it is ascertained,—that the Head preponderates, and in general continues under- most during the whole time of Gestation. Formerly it was supposed, that the Embryo, in the first Months, was situated with the Head uppermost, and that, in the latter Month, the attitude of the Fcetus •was inverted. The Foetus is observed to be coiled up into an oval form, so as to be properly adapted to the Cavity of the Uterus. The Head is bent towards the Thorax, and the Arms are folded:—The Knees are drawn towards the Abdo- men, and the Heels towards the Nates. The Spine is bent into an Arch, and one side of the Body of the Fcetus is frequently turned forwards. The Head is placed diagonally, with its long diame- ter corresponding to that, of the Pelvis, and the Occiput opposed to the Os Tincae. Circulation of the Blood in the Fcetus. The Blood is sent by the Arteries of the Uterus to the Substance of the Placenta, from which, according to the opinion of most of the ancient Anatomists, it passes to the Umbilical Vein by a direct communication of Branches;

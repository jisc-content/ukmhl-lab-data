OF THE VISCERA, &c. [Part IV. 506 They constitute a part of the Abdominal Viscera, and, in a similar manner with them, are connected to the Body by a Production of the Peritoneum, which forms their Tunica Albuginea. Between the Testicle and Scrotum, a Fibrous and Vascular Substance, of a Conical form, is extended,â€” called by Mr Hunter, Grubernaailum, vel Ligamentum Testis, which he considers as a principal agent in direct- ing the course of the Testicle, and in making way for it in its descent. About the eighth Month of Pregnancy, the Testis, by means not yet completely ascertained, passes gra- dually along to the Scrotum, a Process of the Perito- neum preceding it, which afterwards forms its Vaginal Coat. The Testis, through the whole of its course, conti- nues to be covered by the Peritoneum, is connected to the parts on which it rests, and has its Vessels passing to it from behind forwards, the same as when situated in the Abdomen. While the Testicle is passing through the Ring of the Abdominal Muscle, the Ligamentum Testis is found to be in some measure inverted, and to form the under and fore part of the Vaginal Coat, on which the Cremaster is expanded. After the descent of the Testicle, the Peritoneal Pro- cess, which descends along with it, begins to contract at the Ring ; and a firm adhesion of its sides, to within a little distance of the Testicle, is commonly found to be produced by the time of Birth.

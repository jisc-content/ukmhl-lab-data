Part IV.] OF THE ABDOMEN. 199 turn to the left side, where it is lodged in the common root of the Meso-colon and Mesentery, receiving into its back part the ends of the Biliary and Pancreatic Ducts, and going over the Aorta and Vena Cava, at the upper part of the Lumbar Vertebrae. In passing across these Vessels, it is involved in the root of the Mesentery, and ascends a little till it gets to the left side of the Spine; then, perforating the com- mon root of the Mesentery and Meso-colon, it makes a turn forwards, and obtains the name of Jejunum. The Jejunum, so named from its being commonly more empty than the other Intestines, in consequence of the thinner parts of its Contents being sooner absorbed, begins at the last turn of the Duodenum, and forms nu- merous Convolutions, which run in all directions, and are situated in the upper part of the Umbilical Region. The Ilium, named from its numerous Turns, begins where the Jejunum terminates, or where the Internal Plicae become less conspicuous, and is distinguished ex- ternally from that Gut, by being smaller, thinner in its Coats, and paler, and from its forming about three- fifths of the length of the two Intestines. The Ilium, like the Jejunum, forms many convolu- tions, which are situated on the under part of the Um- bilical Region, and extend as far as the Hypogastric and Iliac Regions, and not unfrequentiy, especially in Women, into the Cavity of the Pelvis. It surrounds the lateral parts of the Jejunum, and is supported by the Ossa Ilia ; and, the last turn of the Gut passing across towards the upper edge of the Right N 4 Of.

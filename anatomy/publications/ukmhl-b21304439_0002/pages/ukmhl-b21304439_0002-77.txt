65 OF THE EYE. ?ART IV.] each other, as appears from the Liquor oozing out by the smallest puncture made in the general Capsule. Under the Corpus Ciliare, the Capsule of the Vi- treous Humour sends off an external Lamina, which accompanies the Retina, and is inserted with it into the fore part of the Capsule of the Lens, a little before its anterior edge. It is termed Membranula Corona C?- Haris, or Zonula Ciliaris, from its striated appearance and Circular form. This Membrane, though extremely thin, assists in fixing the Lens to the Vitreous Humour. After sending off the Ciliary Zone, the Coat of the Vitreous Humour goes behind the Capsule of the Lens, with which it is intimately connected. Between the Ciliary Zone and part where the Capsule of the Vitreous Humour adheres to that of the Lens, —which is at the same distance behind the edge of the Lens with the distance of the insertion of the Ciliary Zone before it,—a passage is formed, named Canalis Petitianus, after Petit, who discovered it. The Membranes forming this Passage are pervaded by transverse Fibres, in such a manner, that when Air is introduced, it goes freely round the edge of the Lens; but the Passage has a Cellular appearance, being con- tracted and dilated alternately. The Canal of Petit is nearly of the same breadth with the Corpus Ciliare, is always empty, and has no communication with the Capsules of the Vitreous or Crystalline Humours. No Vessels are to be seen in the Vitreous Humour of an Adult; but in the Eye of a Foetus, an Artery is ob- served to arise from the Central one of the Retina, Vol. II. E which

The Clitoris is also provided with a Li‚Äùamentum S/ts- pensorium, by which it is connected to the Ossa Pubis, and with a Gians, which, like that of the Penis, is ex- tremely sensible, but has no perforation in it for the passage of the Urine. It is covered by a continuation of the Skin of the La- bia, which, at its inferior extremity, forms a Semilunar Fold, termed Preputmm Clitoridis. The Prepuce is furnished with Glandulce Odorifera mpon its inner Surface, and with a small Frcenum which ifixes it to the Gians. In the time of Coition, the Gians Clitoridis is sup- posed to produce nearly the same sensation in the Fe- :male, as the Gians Penis does in the Male. At the under and outer part of the Clitoris are two IBodies, called Nymphce ; which arise narrow from the IPrepuce and Gians, and run obliquely downwards and coutwards along the inside of the Labia, increasing in Ibreadth, but suddenly contracting again at their lower eextremity. They are chiefly formed by a production of the inside cof the Labia, have the same florid colour with them, and iin their natural state are contiguous, and cover the Ori- ifice of the Urethra. They are sometimes of unequal size, and not unfre- Djuently, particularly in warm Climates, they project bo i/ond the edges of the Labia. Their internal Structure consists of Cellular Sub- stance, with a large proportion of Blood-vessels : They have

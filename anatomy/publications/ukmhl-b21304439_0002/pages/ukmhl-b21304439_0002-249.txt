241 Part IV.] ORGANS OF URINE. Vol. II. Q They neither are they cylindrical, as they form slight dilata- tions and contractions in their course, two of which contractions are more observable in their passage over the Psoae Muscles, and at their insertion into the Bladder. The Ureters are covered anteriorly by the Perito- neum, and composed of an External Membranous Coat, a Middle Muscular one, formed chiefly of Circular Fibres, and an Internal Coat, sometimes called Villous. The Inner Coat is very Vascular, and is perforated by the Mouths of small Ducts, which line it with a Mu- cus to defend it from the Urine. The Vessels and Nerves of the Ureters are from those of the contiguous parts. The Kidneys secrete the Urine from the Blood, and convey it by means of the Ureters to the Bladder. RENAL GLANDS. The Renal Glands, termed also Capsules Atrabilariee, Capsides Renales, Renes Succenturiati, and Glandules Su- pra-renales, are two small, flat, Glandular-like Bodies, i of a dark-yellow colour, lying in the upper and back ipart of the Abdomen. They are situated at the upper, inner, and fore part of the Kidneys, over the large Psoae Muscles and Dia- iphragm, and higher than the Renal Vessels.

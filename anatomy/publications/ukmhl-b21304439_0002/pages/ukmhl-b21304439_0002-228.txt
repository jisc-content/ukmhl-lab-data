OF THE VISCERA, &c. [Part IV. 2S0 which passes from the Gall-Bladder and contiguous Sinus Portarum, across the Duodenum, to the Colon ; —another termed Hepatico-Renal^ which descends from the root of the Liver to the Kidney.—These, as well a* the other Ligaments of the Liver in general, are pro- ductions of the Peritoneum. The Ligaments of the Liver preserve it in its proper situation, and of course prevent it from inclining too much in any direction.—The Stomach anti Intestine* support it when the Body is upright, and the Diaphragm when the Body is inverted. The Liver has a simple Coat adhering closelv to it, which it derives from the Peritoneum, and is every where covered by this Membrane, excepting behind, where it adheres to the Diaphragm by Cellular Sub- stance. The Substance of the Liver is composed of several kinds of Vessels, the extreme Branches of which are in- termixed in such a manner, as to form numerous Pulpy Corpuscles, named Acini, which, when minutely exa- mined, are observed to be composed of Vessels in the form of radiated Villi or Penicilli. The Vessels of the Liver are, the Hepatic Artery, Ve- na Portarum, Vena Hepatica, Absu> bents, and Biliary Ducts.—It has likewise numerous Nerves. The Trunks of the Hepatic Artery, Vena Porta?, Bi- liary Ducts, and Nerves, with the Absorbents and Lym- phatic Glands of the Liver, form a large Cord, at its under part. The Artery is situated in the left part of the Cord, the Vein in the right, with the Trunk of the Biliary Ducts before

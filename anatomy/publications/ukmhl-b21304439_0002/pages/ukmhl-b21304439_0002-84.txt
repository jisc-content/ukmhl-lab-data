72 OF THE VISCERA, &c. [Part IV. glasses to enable them to see objects distinctly, at the propel' and ordinary distance. If, on the contrary, the Cornea or Lens be too flat, or the refractive power of the Humours be in any way diminished, the Focus will then be imperfectly formed, till the object is viewed at a greater distance than ordi- nary ; as is the case with persons advanced in life, to whom the assistance of convex glasses becomes neces- sary. How an object, viewed with both Eyes, appears single, has been, as well as our judging of the real si- tuation of any object, ascribed by the generality of Authors to custom and habit; and by others to instinct, which regulates the uniform motion of the Eyes, and the accurate application of both to one point. The Eye is enabled to judge of, or accommodate it- self to objects at different distances, by the action of its Muscles increasing or diminishing the length of its axis, and by the motions of the Iris allowing a greater or smaller quantity of light to be thrown into the Eye.

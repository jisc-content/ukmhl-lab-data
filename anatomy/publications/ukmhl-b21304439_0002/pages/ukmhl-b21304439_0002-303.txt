295 Part IV.] ORGANS OF GENERATION. T 4 The Blood of the Uterus.—By the intervention of the Cord, also, the Placenta is more readily extracted. The Placenta, or Cake, is a Spongy Mass, of a round form, though sometimes oblong, or lobular, occupying near a fourth part of the Ovum, and is common to the young of many other Animals. It is about seven or eight inches in breadth, and up- wards of one inch in thickness; but is thinner at the edges where the Membranes go off. While attached to the Uterus, it is concave next the Child, and convex towards the Womb. i The External Surface, or that next the Uterus, is di- vided into Lobules with Fissures between them, while the Internal, or that next the Fcetus, forms a regular Mass, which has numerous large Branches of the Um- bilical Vessels dispersed upon it in a radiated manner. In the Placenta are to be observed,—on the side next the Child,—the Ramifications of the Umbilical Vessels forming the principal part of its Substance ;—on the side next the Mother,—Branches of the Uterine Arte- ries, almost of the size of Crow-quills, passing in a con- voluted manner between the Uterus, and Placenta, and terminating in the latter;—Veins corresponding with these Arteries, but flat and of great size, running ob- liquely from the Placenta to the Uterus,—and, in the Substance of the Placenta, an appearance which has been supposed by many Authors to be the common Cellular Membrane, of a tender nature, and easily ruptured by Injection, but which is considered by late Authors as a regular Spongy Substance, similar to that in the Body of the Penis.

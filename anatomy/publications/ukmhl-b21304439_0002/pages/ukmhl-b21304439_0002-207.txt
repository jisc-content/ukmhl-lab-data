This Substance, by contracting, prevents the grosser indigested parts of the Aliment from escaping, and, by dilating, allows the Pulpy digested part to pass to the Intestines. The Third Coat, commonly called Nervous, some- times Vascular, but properly Cellular, consists of a large quantity of fine Cellular Substance without Fat, and is intermixed with, and supported by, small Aponeurotic- like Filaments, which cross each other obliquely, but. which are also of a Cellular nature. This Coat strengthens the Stomach, and allows the Vessels to be distributed to the Inner Coat, with which it is intimately connected. The Fourth, ox Inner Coat, called also Villous, is con- tinued from the Inner Coat of the Esophagus, but has much more of a Velvet appearance than it.â€”It is form- ed of fine, short, prominent Villi, which are crowded with Small Vessels, some for furnishing a Mucous Li- quor to the Stomach, others for absorbing a portion of the thinner part of the Food. The two last Coats are more extensive than the rest, and form, upon the inner part of the Stomach, many Doublings, termed Rugce, the greater number of which run in a wavering transverse direction, and are after- wards divided into a sort of Net-work.

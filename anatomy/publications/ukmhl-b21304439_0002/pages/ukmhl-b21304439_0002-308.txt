OF THE VISCERA, &c. [Part IV. 300 In the Foetus, the Fluids are proportionally larger in quantity, and the Solidsgenerally softer, than in the Adult. The Skin is of a bright red colour, in consequence of its greater degree ol Vascularity, and is covered with an Unctuous Substance, supposed to be secreted from the Vessels upon the Surface of the Skin. That part chiefly of the Cellular Membrane is Adi- pose, which is near the Surface of the Body ; scarcely any Fat being found in the more interior parts, where it gradual!) accumulates till the person arrive at a con- siderable time of life. The Brain, Spinal Marrow, and Nervous System, are proportionally larger., but softer. The .Sanguiferous System, and Glandular Organs, are larger. The Pupil of the Eye is occupied and completely co- vered by the Membrana. Papillaris, which arises from the inner margin of the Iris, and continues there till the seventh Month, when it gradually vanishes. It is a very Vascular Substance, and separates the Cameras from each other. According to Blumenbach, it keeps the Iris ex- panded during the rapid increase of the Ball of the Eye. The Crystalline Lens is almost Spherical, and has nu- merous Vessels dispersed upon its Capsule. The Meatus Auditorius is wholly Cartilaginous, and adheres by its extremity to an imperfect Bony Circle, in which the Membrana Tympani is placed. The Meatus Externus, and Membrana Tympani, are lined by a Mucous Membrane, which is cast off after Birth. The Thymus Gland, in the Foetus, is a large Sub- stance, situated in the upper part of the Thorax, be- tween the Layers of the Anterior Mediastinum. 1

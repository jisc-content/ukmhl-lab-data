Part IV.] OF THE NOSE. 10.**. The Structure of the Lacrymal Sac and Duct is simi- lar to that of the Membrana Schneideriana. They are defended by the same kind of Mucus with which this Membrane is lubricated, and are firmly connected to the Periosteum of the Osseous Canal. The Use of this Passage is,—to convey the superfluous Tears to the Nose, so as to prevent them from passing over the Cheek. The Ductus Incisivus, vel Nasalo-Palalmus of Strno, is a small Canal, which, as lias been already observed in the description of the Bones, is only sometimes met with in the Human Body, though it is always to be found in the Ox, Plorse, Sheep, &c. When present, it takes its Origin from a small Pit, formed in the fore part of the bottom of the Nostril, under the termination of the Lacrymal Duct. It runs obliquely downwards and forwards, placed in such a manner as to receive and conduct the Tears into the Mouth. The Arteries of the Nose come chiefly from the Ex- ternal Carotids. Those of the outer part of the Nose come from the Facial and Internal Maxillary Arteries;—those of the inner from the Internal Maxillary; and a few Twigs are furnished by the Ocular Arteries. The Veins go to the External Jugulars. They like- wise communicate with the Ocular Veins, and of course with the Lateral Sinuses and Internal Jugulars. The Nerves with which the outer part of the Nose is chiefly supplied, come from the second Branch of G 4 the

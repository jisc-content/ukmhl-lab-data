OF THE VISCERA, &c. [Part IV. 230 . nions have been entertained with respect to the use of this Organ. Many of the Ancients were of opinion,—that besides the Bile of the Liver, there was an Atra Bilis, or Black Bile, and that the Spleen was the receptacle of it. Others have thought a particular Menstruum was se- creted in it, and conveyed to the Stomach for the pur- pose of Digestion. Others again,—that the Blood of the Spleen promotes the sluggish circulation of the Blood of the Vena Portae. The late Mr Hewson, who has written particularly on the Spleen, was of opinion, it concurred with the Thymus and Lymphatic Glands, in forming the red Globules of the Blood, and that these Globules were rendered complete in the Spleen. It has been also supposed,—that as the Stomach be- comes full, the Spleen is compressed by it, in conse- quence of which a greater quantity of Blood is sent to the Pancreas, for the secretion of the Pancreatic Juice. But the present most prevalent opinion is,—that the Blood undergoes some change in it, which renders it uselul in the secretion of the Bile; and the opinion is supported from the great quantity of Blood with which this Organ is known to be supplied, and from its Vein, not only in Man, but in other Animals, passing to the Vena Portae.

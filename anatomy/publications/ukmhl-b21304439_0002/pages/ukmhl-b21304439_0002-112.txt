OF THE VISCERA, &c. [Part IV, 100 Ossa Spongiosa into three Meatus, or Passages, which run from before backwards, and are described by Hal- ler according to their situations, viz. The Meatus Narium Superior, placed at the upper, inner, and back part of the Superior Spongy Bone. The Meatus Medius, situated between the Superior and Inferior Spongy Bones j and, The Meatus Inferior, situated between the Inferior Spongy Bone and Bottom of the Nose. The inside of the Nose is lined with a thick Spongy Substance, termed Membrane/. Mucosa, or Membrane, Pituitaria of Schneider, or Membrana Schneideriana, v which adheres to the Periosteum, and is also continued to the different Sinuses, to the Lacrymal Sacs and Pa- latine Ducts, to the Pharynx, Palate, and Eustachian Tubes. This Membrane is very Vascidar and Nervous, and is the Primary Organ of Smelling. It is constantly lubri- cated and preserved in a proper degree of moisture by the Mucus of the Nose, which is discharged from nu- merous small Follicles, every where dispersed over the Surface of that Membrane. The Passages of the different Sinuses of the Bones of the Plead, after having run obliquely backwards in a short winding direction, terminate by small openings in the Cavity of the Nose. The Frontal Sinuses send Passages downwards into the anterior Ethmoid Cells, which terminate in the up- per part of the Nose, behind the beginning of the La- crymal Sacs. Besides

134 OF THE VISCERA, See. [Part IV. The them, space is gained for the Front Teeth, which other- wise would be distorted in the Jaws. The Jaws grow uniformly throughout for about a year after birth, and as far as the Teeth extend, form nearly half of a circle; after all the Temporary Teeth have appeared, the Jaws elongate, so that in the Adult they form half of a long Ellipsis. The extension which takes place between the last Temporary Molaris and the Coronoid Process, and in the corresponding parts of the Upper Jaw, continues to increase till the eighteenth or twentieth year, the ante- rior part of the Jaw adapting itself to the Permanent Teeth, but scarcely receiving any additional size.

The Arches of the Palate are two in number in each side of the Throat, one of which is termed the Anterior, the other the Posterior Arch. They are formed of a Doubling of the Skin, with a few scattered Muscular Fibres. The Anterior Arch arises from the middle of the Ve- lum Palati, at the side of the Uvula, and is fixed to the edge of the Base of the Tongue.

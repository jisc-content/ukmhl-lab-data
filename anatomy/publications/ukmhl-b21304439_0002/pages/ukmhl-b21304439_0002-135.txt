Part IV.] OF THE MOUTH, &c. 123 other Teeth are thrown farther back than the corre- sponding Teeth of the Under Jaw; in consequence of which, in well-formed Teeth, when the Jaws are shut, the Teeth of the Upper Jaw are opposed to the Inter- stices of the Teeth of the Under one, and the third Molares of the Upper Jaw being smaller than those of the Under, allow the Teeth to close even at their poste- rior parts. By such a construction, the Teeth are properly adapted to the Manducation of the Food, and one Tooth being lost, its opponent remains useful, by act- ing upon the parts of the Teeth immediately opposed to it. I Of the Temporary Teeth. In a Foetus of three or four Months after conception, the Jaws are distinctly formed ; but in place of Sockets, there are Grooves running along the Jaws, with im- pressions within them, forming the origins of the future Alveoli. The Grooves are narrow and deep at the fore part of the Jaws, and become wider and more shallow to- wards their posterior extremities. In the bottom of the Groove of the Lower Jaw, the Inferior Maxillary Vessels and Nerves are placed, which have afterwards a Canal peculiar to themselves. Within the Alveolar Grooves, there are, at this time. Ridges which gradually extend from the bottom and in- ner sides, forming Arches; and the Cavities becoming deeper, their external Openings contract, till, at the

Ua OF THE VISCERA, &c. [Part IV, Origin of the Permanent Teeth. The Permanent Incisores and Cuspidati succeed to i the Temporary Incisores and Cuspidati; they are simi- lar in form to these, but much larger; but the Tempo- rary Molares are succeeded by the Bicuspides, which are much smaller. When the Rudiments of the Temporary Teeth are somewhat advanced, a New Sac is sent off at the under and inner part of the Sacs of the Temporary Teeth of the Upper Jaw, and at the upper and inner part of the corresponding Sacs of the Under Jaw, the new Sacs lying between those of the Temporary Teeth and the Internal Alveolar Plate, each being on the inner side of the Tooth it is to succeed, and connected to the Gum. Sec Dr Blakeâ€™s Thesis, Edin. 1798. These Sacs are at first contained in the same Sockets with the Temporary Teeth, and are loosely connected with the Membranes of these. By degrees, little Nitches are formed in the internal Alveolar Plate, and these gradually form a distinct Socket round each of the Sacs. When the Temporary Teeth have advanced in their Sockets, the Sacs of the Permanent Teeth become elon- gated, but still remain attached to the Sacs and Gums at the Necks of the Temporary Teeth, by means of Pro- cesses which pass through small Foramina at the inner ed<xe of the Jaw. At the time ofbirth, Ossification has commenced upon the anterior Permanent Molaris, and there are small Membranous''^

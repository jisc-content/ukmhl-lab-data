25$ OF THE VISCERA, &c. [Part IV. kc Seminales by the late Mr Hunter,—from which he was of opinion,—that they are not Reservoirs of Se- men, but Glands secreting a particular Mucus;—that, with other parts, they are subservient to the purposes of Generation;—and that the Bulb of the Urethra is the Receptacle of the Semen, in which it is accumulat- ed previous to its ejection. The Prostate Gland, or Corpus Glandulosum, lies immediately behind the under end of the Symphysis Pubis, and rests upon the Intestinum Rectum. It surrounds and closely embraces the Neck of the Bladder, or beginning of the Urethra; but the greater part of it is placed posteriorly and laterally, having a Lobe projecting on each side. It is about the size of a Walnut, and of the figure of a Spanish Chesnut,—or it resembles a heart as common- ly painted on Playing-cards, with the Base towards the Bladder, and the point towards the Penis. The middle of the Base of the Prostate Gland, be- tween the common Seminal Ducts and Bladder, is sometimes, especially in the diseased state, of a round- ed form, and has been described by Mr Home, in the Philosophical Transactions 1806, as a Third Lobe of this Gland. The Prostate has a red Fleshy appearance, and is of a j Spongy substance, but is one of the firmest Glands of s the Body, and generally sends out Ten or Twelve Ducts, which open obliquely near the beginning of the Ure- thra, at the sides of the Caput Gallinaginis, the Ori- , fices of these Ducts surrounding the terminations of the Seminal Canals. t From

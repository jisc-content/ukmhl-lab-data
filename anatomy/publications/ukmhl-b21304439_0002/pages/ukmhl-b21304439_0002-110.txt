OF THE VISCERA, &c. [Fart IV. 98 By the Os Ethmoides and Ossa Unguis, which form the upper, inner, and lateral parts : And by the Ossa Maxillaria Supcriora, Ossa Palati, Os Sphenoidcs, Ossa Spongiosa Inferiora, and Vomer, which form the under, inner, and back part.

Of the five Cartilages, one is situated in the middle, and the other four laterally. The middle Cartilage is the most considerable, and supports the rest: It constitutes the Cartilaginous part of the Septum Narium, and is joined to the anterior edge of the Nasal Lamella of the Ethmoid Bone, to the anterior edge of the Vomer, and to the fore part of the Spinous Process of the Superior Maxillary Bones. Of the lateral Cartilages, two are placed anteriorly, forming by their curved union the Tip of the Nose *, and two posteriorly, which form the Aloe Nasi. Between the anterior and posterior Cartilages, are Spaces filled with the additional Cartilages, the number, size, and figure, varying in different Bodies.

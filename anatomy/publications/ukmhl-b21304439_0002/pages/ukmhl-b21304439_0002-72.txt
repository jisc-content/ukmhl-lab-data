W> OF THE VISCERA, &c. [Part IV. ccivcd into a Depression on the fore part of the Vitreous Humour. Like a common Lens, or magnifying Glass, it has two convex Surfaces, the anterior of which is in general less convex than the posterior; the two being formed of segments of spheres of unequal size. The anterior Surface, according to the experiments of Petit, forms the segment of a sphere, the diameter of which is between seven and eight lines, or twelfths of an inch ; while the posterior Surface is only equal to the segment of a sphere of about five linos in diameter. It has been observed by Zinn,—that the figure of the Lens varies at different periods, being in the Foetus al- most of a spherical form, but becoming gradually flat- ter on the anterior and posterior Surfaces, till about the age of thirty, after which its form docs not appear to vary. As the figure, so also the colour and consistency, are found to change at different times of life.—In the Foetus, not only a Capsule, which covers it, but^the Lens also, is of a reddish colour; but immediately after Birth, they become perfectly transparent.—-In a Person consi- derably advanced in years, the Lens is observed to ac- quire a yellow tinge, which appears first in the centre, and afterwards extends gradually to the circumference j and in extreme old age, this yellow tinge becomes so deep as to resemble Amber. An Aqueous Fluid is described as being situated be- tween the Crystalline Lamellae^ which is supposed to decrease in quantity, and to become somewhat yellow; the Lens at the same time increasing in solidity as the Person

. H9 Part IV.] OF THE THORAX. K 3 corne of the Mamma, numberless Tubes arise, called Ductus or TubuliLactiferi. They gradually unite into Trunks, which run in a radiated manner, and, becoming greatly enlarged in the time of Suckling, serve as Reservoirs in which the Milk is contained. The Lactiferous Ducts are accompanied, in the Sub- stance of the Mamma, by a tough white Elastic Sub- stance, which follows them to the Nipple. At the root of the Nipple they become contracted, and are there from Twelve to Eighteen and upwards in number. Either from the want of uniformity, however, with respect to their number in different Subjects, or from the difficulty of perceiving them, they have been va- riously estimated by different Authors. Near the root of the Nipple, they have been supposed by Dr Meckel to form a circle of communication j— but this has been ascribed, by still later Anatomists, to a laceration of Vessels. Numerous preparations and ex- periments,—particularly that of throwing in an Injec- tion at one Duct, and finding that it fills only one part of the Mamma, without returning by any other Duct, —seem sufficiently to indicate, that there is no such cir- cular communication. In the Substance of the Nipple, the Lactiferous Tubes are at a little distance from each other, and are coiled up in such a manner, that the spontaneous flow of the Milk is prevented, unless it be accumulated in a large quantitj'. But when the Nipple is drawn out and extended,—as by the application of the Child’s Mouth,-—the Ducts be-

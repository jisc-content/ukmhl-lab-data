LIGAMENTS OF THE PELVIS. 469 Now, if we draw an imaginary longitudinal line through the se- cond toe, we find that all the dorsal muscles draw from that line, and the plantar towards it. This is the key to the action of them all. A more detailed account of these muscles is given in the dissection of the palm. It now only remains to trace the tendons of the peroneus longus and the tibialis posticus. The tendon of the peroneus longus is the deepest in the sole. We find it running through a groove in the cuboid hone obliquely across the sole towards its insertion into the outer side of the base of the metatarsal bone of the great toe. The tendon is confined in a strong fibrous sheath, which is lined throughout by synovial membrane. The tendon of the tibialis posticus may be traced over the in- ternal lateral ligament of the ankle, and thence under the head of the astragalus to the scaphoid bone into which it is chiefly inserted. One or two slips are sent off to the cuneiform bones. We observe that the tendon greatly contributes to support the head of the astragalus, and that for this purpose it often contains a sesamoid bone. DISSECTION OF THE LIGAMENTS. 99. Ligaments of the pelvis.—The sacrum is united to the last lumbar vertebra in the same manner as one vertebra is to ano- ther. The same observation applies to the union between the sacrum and the coccyx. We therefore refer the reader to the de- scription of the ligaments of the spine.* The innominate bones are connected to each other in front, con- stituting the pubic symphysis ; and posteriorly to the sacrum or the spine, constituting the sacro-iliac symphysis. These sym- physes, as well as their connecting ligaments, we will separately examine. 100. Pubic symphysis.—This is secured by 1. an anterior liga- ment, consisting of oblique and transverse fibres; 2. a posterior * See the end of the Dissection of the Head and Neck.

320 PARTS CONCERNED IN INGUINAL HERNIA. 14. Coverings of the different hernia.—An oblique inguinal hernia must necessarily have all the coverings of the cord. Be- neath the skin, therefore, and the subcutaneous tissue, there will be 1. The spermatic fascia, derived from the aponeurosis of the external oblique. 2. The cremaster muscle, derived from the internal oblique and transversalis. 13. The infundibuliform fascia, derived from the fascia under the transversalis muscle. The incomplete inguinal hernia will be covered by 1. The aponeurosis of the external oblique. 2. The cremaster. 3. The infundibuliform fascia. The direct inguinal hernia will be covered only by 1. The spennatic fascia. 2. The fascia transversalis.* In all cases, or at any rate with very few exceptions, the imme- diate investment of the intestine is the peritoneum. This consti- tutes the sac of the hernia. The opening of the sac, communi- cating with the abdomen, is called its mouth, then comes the neck, and lastly, the body or expanded part of the sac. 15. Position of the spermatic cord in reference to the hernia. —The spermatic cord is generally situated behind and rather on the outer side of the hernial sac. But instances sometimes occur in which there is a different arrangement, and such deviations are easily explained. Since the spennatic vessels and the hernial swelling are more or less connected by cellular tissue, and included, as it were, in a common sheath, we can have no difficulty in un- derstanding that the gradually increasing tumor may separate the component parts of the cord, so that one or other of them may come to lie on the front of the swelling. A similar displacement is sometimes produced by an old and large hydrocele on the same principle; the increase of the watery tumor affecting the spermatic * What becomes, it may be asked, of the aponeurotic insertion of the muscular stratum ? The hernia slips between its fibres.

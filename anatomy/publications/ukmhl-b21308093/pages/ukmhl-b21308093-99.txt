BACK OF THE FORE-ARM. 83 high up in the substance of the muscle, and receives fleshy fibres on its deep surface nearly as low as the end of the ulna. The tendon then traverses a distinct groove on the back of the ulna, close to the styloid process, and is inserted into the inner and pos- terior part of the carpal end of the metacarpal bone of the little finger. Below the styloid process of the ulna, the tendon passes beneath the posterior annular ligament, over the back of the wrist, and is here contained in a very strong fibrous canal, which is attached to the back of the cuneiform, pisiform, and unciform hones, and is lined by a continuation from the synovial membrane in the groove of the ulna. The action of this muscle is to extend the hand, and incline it towards the ulnar side. In pronation of the fore-arm, the lower end of the ulna projects between the tendons of the extensor carpi ulnaris and the extensor minimi digiti. A subcutaneous bursa is sometimes found above the bone in this situation; another is more deeply seated between the bone and the fascia, and in some instances communicates with the joint beneath it. 137. The anconeus is a small triangular muscle situated at the outer and back part of the elbow. It is covered by a strong layer of fascia, derived from the tendon of the triceps, and appears like a continuation of that muscle. It arises from the posterior part of the external condyle of the humerus, by a tendon which descends for some distance along the radial side of the muscle. The upper fibres, continuous with those of the triceps, pass trans- versely inwards, to be attached to the olecranon; the lower, in- creasing successively in length and obliquity, are inserted into the triangular surface, on the upper fourth of the outer part of the ulna. Part of the under surface of the muscle is in contact with the capsule of the elbow-joint. A bursai is sometimes found be- tween its tendon and the head of the radius. Its action is to assist in extending the fore-arm. 138. Deeper seated muscles on the back of the fore-arm.â€” Detach from the external condyle the extensor carpi radialis bre- vior, the extensor digitorum communis, the extensor minimi digiti, and the extensor caipi ulnaris. Observe the small bursa which is situated between the common tendon of these muscles and that of

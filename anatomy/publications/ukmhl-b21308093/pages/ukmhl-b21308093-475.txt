DISSECTION OF THE CALF. 457 By clearing out all the fat, we observe that the popliteal ves- sels enter the ham through an aperture in the adductor magnus, and descend close to the hack part of the femur, and afterwards over the back of the knee-joint. At first they are partially over- lapped (at least in muscular subjects) by the semi-membranosus; indeed, the outer border of this muscle is a good guide to the artery in the operation of tying it. With a little care, we may discover two or more absorbent glands, which are situated one on either side of the artery. They deserve attention, because, when enlarged, their close proximity to the artery may give them an apparent pulsation which might be mistaken for an aneurism. Deferring a more complete description of the course, relations, and branches of the popliteal artery till this vessel is exposed throughout its whole course, we think it advisable to pass on now to the great muscles of the calf. DISSECTION OF THE CALF. An incision should be made down the centre of the calf to the heel, and the skin reflected on either side. We have first to exa- mine the cutaneous veins and nerves. 67. Cutaneous veins and nerves.—The chief cutaneous vein and nerve of the calf is called the external or posterior saphenous. The vein commences on the outer side of the foot, runs behind the external ankle, and then up the back of the calf, receiving nume- rous tributary veins in its course. It eventually passes through the muscular fascia over the popliteal space, and joins the popliteal vein. a. The corresponding nerve is formed, as it were, by two roots,* —one from the peroneal, the other from the popliteal. The roots generally unite about the middle of the calf, and the single nerve coming through the fascia, descends with the saphenous vein, and is finally distributed to the outer side of the foot and the little toe. * These two roots are sometimes called respectively the communicans peronei and communicans poplitei.

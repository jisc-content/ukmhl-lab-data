VU1 PREFACE. The several regions of the body are treated of in the order considered most suitable for their examination; and the mus- cles, vessels, nerves, &c. are described, as they are successively exposed to view in the process of dissection. The arrangement by numbered paragraphs and subdivisions has been adopted to facilitate reference. It is intended to publish the work in Pour Parts, com- prising the Dissection of the Arm, that of the Head and Neck, the Abdomen and Pelvis, and the Leg, respectively. The Author has written the work entirely from actual obser- vation : at the same time no available sources of information have been neglected, the highest authorities both English and Foreign having been carefully consulted. His acknow- ledgments are especially due to P. C. Skey, Esq. F.R.S. Lecturer on Anatomy at St. Bartholomewâ€™s Hospital, for many valuable suggestions. He is also much indebted to his young friend, Mr. W. Clubbe, for able assistance in dissections.

The larynx of the adult male is in all proportions about one- third larger than that of the adult female. The alae of the thyroid cartilage form a much more acute angle in the male; hence the greater projection of the “ pomum Adami,” and the greater length of the vocal cords, in the male. j Male ... 8 lines The average length of the vocal cords is in the !• J Female ... ... 6 “ j Male .. 12 lines The average length of the glottis is in the 1 j Female ... ... 10 “ The size of the larynx does not necessarily follow the propor- tions of the general stature in either sex; it may be as large in a little person as in a tall one : and this corresponds with what we know of the voice. 171. Crico-thyroid articulation.—This little joint is provided with a capsule and synovial membrane. There are,besides, two ligaments, much stronger than might have been expected from the smallness of the joint. Both proceed from the cornu of the thyroid cartilage; the one upwards and backwards, the other downwards and forwards to the cricoid. The articulation between the arytenoid and cricoid cartilages has a loose capsular and synovial membrane, in ac- cordance with the extensive range of its motions. DISSECTION OE THE TONGUE. The tongue, with the os-hyoides and larynx, should he removed from its several connexions in order that it may be examined apart from the body. 172. The tongue is a very complex muscular organ, subservient to the several purposes of taste, speech, suction, mastication, and deglu- tition. Its figure is so well known that it needs no description.

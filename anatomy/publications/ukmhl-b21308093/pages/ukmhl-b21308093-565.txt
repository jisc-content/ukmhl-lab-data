DESCENT 01' THE TESTICLES. 547 seventh, and about the ninth has entered the scrotum. Its original peritoneal coat is retained throughout; but, as it enters the inguinal canal, the peritoneal lining of the abdomen is protruded before it, and eventually becomes the tunica vaginalis reflexa. Immediately after the descent of the testis, then, its serous bag communicates with the abdomen, and in the lower animals continues to do so through life.* But in the human subject the canal of communication soon begins to close; so that, before the end of the first month after birth, the canal is entirely obliterated from the abdominal ring to the testis. Sometimes, however, this obliteration fails to take place, or is only partial; hence may arise congenital hernia, or hydrocele of the cord. * According to Professor Owen, the chimpanzee is the only exception to this rule.

DISSECTION OF THE ORGAN OF HEARING. 584 Muscles of the pinna.—The muscles which move the cartilage of the ear as a whole have been described in the dissection of the Head and Neck, § 181. Other little muscles there are which extend from one part of the cartilage to the other; hut they are so indistinct, lliat, unless the body be very muscular, our attempt to find them will be made in vain. The five following are usually described by anatomists: four on the front of the pinna, and one behind it — a. The musculus major helicis runs vertically along the front margin of the pinna. h The m. minor helicis lies over that part of the helix which comes up from the bottom of the concha. c. The m. tragicus lies vertically over the outer surface of the tragus. d. The m. anti-lragicus proceeds transversely from the anti-tragus to the helix. e. The m. transversus is on the back of the pinna: it passes from the back of the concha to the helix. The arteries of the pinna are derived from the posterior auri- cular and the temporal. The nerves are furnished by the auriculo- parotidean branch of the cervical plexus, and the temporo-auricular branch of the inferior maxillary. Meatus auditorius.—This passage leads down to the membrana tympani, or drum of the ear. It is formed partly by a tubular continuation of the concha, partly by an osseous canal in the tem- poral bone. It is not a straight tube, but inclines at first upwards and forwards, and then curves a little downwards.* Its length is rather more than an inch. It is not throughout of the same calibre ; the narrowest part is about the middle : hence the difficulty in extracting foreign bodies which have gained access to the bottom of it. The true skin and the cuticle are continued down it; and, becoming gradually thinner, form a kind of cul-de-sac * In order to obtain a correct knowledge of the length and dimensions of the meatus, we ought to make sections through it in different directions, or a cast of it in common j-laister.

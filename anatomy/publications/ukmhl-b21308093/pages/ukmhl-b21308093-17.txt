A MANUAL OF THE DISSECTION OF THE HUMAN BODY. THE DISSECTION OF THE ARM. 1. The arm being placed at a right angle with the body, let three incisions, not dividing more than the thickness of the skin, be made in the following directions. The first, along the front of the sternum from its upper to its lower end; the second, along the whole length of the clavicle; the third, commencing at the lower end of the sternum, should be continued outwards for four inches, and thence upwards along the front border of the axilla to the arm. The skin should be carefully separated from the subjacent layer of adipose and cellular tissue, usually called the superficial fascia, a structure which exists, in greater or less development, over nearly the whole of the body. It consists of fibro-cellular tissue, containing within its cells a variable quantity of fat, and is intimately united to the skin by a number of fibrous processes, but more loosely connected to the parts beneath, so that the skin is enabled to move freely over them. From the superficial fascia over the front of the chest arises a broad cutaneous muscle, called the Platys?na myoides. It con- sists of thin, pale, and sometimes scarcely perceptible muscular fibres, which ascend over the clavicle, and are continued along the side of the neck, to the low'er jaw and the cheek. 2.

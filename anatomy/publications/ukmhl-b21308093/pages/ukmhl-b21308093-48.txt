32 FRONT OF THE FORE-ARM. On the radial side of the fore-arm will be found the superficial radial veins, with filaments of the external cutaneous nerve. On the ulnar side are the superficial ulnar veins, accompanied hy filaments of the internal cutaneous nerve. The external cutaneous branch of the musculo-spiral nerve along the outer and back part of the fore-arm. About the lower third of the radial border of the forearm, the radial nerve becomes superficial, and turns over the radius to supply the hack of the hand and fingers. Near the styloid process of the ulna, the superficial branch of the ulnar nerve perforates the fascia to reach the hack of the hand. 45. The largest veins of the hand are placed on its dorsal surface, in order to be out of ihe way of pressure. Commencing at the ex- tremity, and running on either side of the fingers, the veins unite on the hack of the hand to form a plexus in the shape of an arch, with its concavity upwards, from which the veins of the fore-arm arise. From the external side of the arch, near the metacaipal bone of the thumb, several branches unite to form the superficial radial veins, which run along the outer and front part of the fore-arm to the bend of the elbow, receiving numerous smaller veins in their course. From the internal side of the arch, near the metacaipal bone of the little finger, commences the root of the superficial ulnar veins, which proceed along the inner and front side of the fore-arm to the elbow. Along the middle of the fore-arm lies the median vein, which is formed by the superficial veins in front of the wrist, and terminates at the elbow hy joining the cephalic and the basilic veins. Such is the most frequent arrangement of the veins, hut they are subject to great variety, and they always communicate by large branches with each other. For the disposition of the superficial veins at the elbow, see ยง 26. 46. Examine the superficial nerves of the fore-arm. a. The external cutaneous nerve perforates the fascia between the outer edge of the tendon of the biceps and the supinator radii longus muscle. It passes sometimes above, but most frequently below, the median cephalic vein, sending generally a slender fila-

417 ANATOMY OF THE LARGE INTESTINE. blood-vessels, it deserves to be remarked that a piece of well-injected mucous membrane from the large intestine presents the same hexagonal arrangement on the surface as that of the stomach ; but the gastric glands are absent. b. llio-c<Ecal valve.—At the junction of the small with the large intestine the mucous membrane is folded in such a manner as to form a valve; but it is not a perfect one, as is proved by pouring water into the large intestine, or by the occasional vomit- ing of injections. The arrangement of the valve is best examined in a dried preparation. We then observe that the opening is a transverse fissure, and that there are two flaps to it. The upper one is nearly perpendicular, while the lower is nearly horizontal ;•— but a single glance gives a better idea of its construction than any description. c. Folds in the rectum. — In many subjects we observe that transverse or oblique folds of the mucous membrane project into the rectum. We cannot see them to advantage unless the bowel be hardened by alcohol in its natural position. Three, more pro- minent than the rest, and half an inch, or thereabouts, in width, were first pointed out by Mr. Housten.* One projects from the upper part of the rectum, opposite the prostate gland ; another is situated higher up, on the side of the bowel; while.the third is still higher. When thickened or ulcerated, these folds are apt to occasion pain or even obstruction in defecation. * Dublin Hospital Reports, vol. v.

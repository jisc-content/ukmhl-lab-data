BACK OF THE FORE-ABM. 78 we find large veins, and branches of the radial (see § 59, a b) and ulnar nerves (see § 62 a). The veins are generally situated be- neath the nerves. The dorsal branch of the ulnar nerve passes very obliquely beneath the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris, and over the internal lateral ligament of the wrist; and divides upon the back of the hand into filaments, which become the dorsal nerves of the little finger, the ring finger, and the ulnar side of the middle finger. The radial nerve passes obliquely beneath the tendon of the supinator longus, and subdivides into branches, which supply both sides of the back of the thumb and fore-finger, and the radial side of the middle finger. This last branch always communicates with a filament from the ulnar nerve. The relative share which the radial and ulnar nerves take in supplying the fingers, is not the same in all cases. Under any arrangement, the thumb and each finger has two dorsal nerves, one on either side, of which the terminal branches reach the root of the nail. They supply filaments to the skin on the back of the finger, and have frequent communications with the palmar digital nerves. In some instances, one or more of the dorsal nerves do not extend beyond the first phalanx; their place is then supplied by a branch from the palmar nerve. 131. The fascia on the back o f the fore-arm is composed of fibres interlacing in various directions, and is thicker and stronger than that upon the front surface of the fore-arm. It is attached to the two condyles of the humerus and to the olecranon, and is strengthened by an expansion from the tendon of the triceps. Along the fore-arm it is attached to the ridge on the posterior part of the ulna. Its upper third gives origin to the fibres of the mus- cles beneath it, and separates them by septa, to which their fibres are also attached. Posterior annular ligament.—This should not be considered as a distinct ligament, but rather as a part of the fascia of the fore- arm, strengthened by oblique aponeurotic fibres near the back of the wrist in order to confine the extensor tendons. These fibres are firmly attached to the styloid process of the radius, and thence pass obliquely inwards to the inner side of the wrist, where they

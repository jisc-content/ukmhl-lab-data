V DISSECTION OF THE NOSE. 283 224. The portio dura or facial nerve, having arrived at the bottom of the meatus auditorius internus, enters what is called the “ canalis or aqueductus Fallopii.”* This is a tortuous canal ex- cavated through the substance of the temporal bone, and terminat- ing at the stylo-mastoid foramen. In this canal the nerve runs. When exposed throughout its whole course, we observe that the nerve proceeds from the meatus internus for a short distance out- wardly, then makes a sudden bend backwards along the inner wall of the tympanum above the fenestra ovalis, and lastly, curving downwards at the back of the tympanum, it leaves the skull at the stylo-mastoid foramen. The most important part of its course is the bend or knee, as it is called. In this situation it is consi- derably swollen, and gives off— a. The large petrosal nerve (vidian) which runs to the spheno- palatine ganglion (see § 216, e). h. The small petrosal nerve, which runs to the otic ganglion (see § 217). c. Chorda tympani.—This nerve takes a very remarkable course. It arises at an acute angle from the facial about \ of an inch before its exit from the stylo-mastoid foramen, ascends for a short distance in a bony canal at the back of the tympanum, and enters that cavity below the pyramid and close to the membrana tympani. It then runs forwards through the tympanum, across the handle of the malleus, to the fissura Glaseri, through which it emerges at the base of the skull, and joining the gustatory nervo finally proceeds to the submaxillary ganglion (see § 28, a.)

479 SYNOVIAL MEMBRANES OF THE FOOT. Being composed, moreover, of several pieces, each of which pos- sesses a certain elasticity, the foot gains a general springiness and solidity which could not have resulted from a single bone. Exclusive of the ankle-joint and the phalanges of the toes, the bones of the foot are provided with six distinct synovial membranes,â€” namely, a. Between the posterior articular surface of the astragalus and os calcis. b. Between the head of the astragalus and the bones composing its socket. c. Between the os calcis and the os cuboides. d. Between the inner cuneiform bone and the metatarsal bone of the great toe. e. Between the three cuneiform and the adjoining bones (the great toe excepted). f. Between the os cuboides and the fourth and fifth metatarsal bones. The phalanges of the toes are connected in all respects like those of the fingers. See, therefore, the description given in the dissection of the hand. * END OF PART III.

DISSECTION OF THE EYE. 521 distributed to the mucous membrane of the pharynx and the back of the tongue. The pneumogastric is distributed to the pharynx, the larynx, the heart and lungs, the aesopliagus, and the stomach. The nervus accessorius supplies the sterno-mastoid and the trapezius muscles. For the further description of these nerves, see Head and Neck, § 218. Ninth pair, or hypoglossal.—This nerve arises by several roots from the medulla oblongata, close to the side of the pyramid. It leaves the skull through the anterior condyloid foramen, and is dis- tributed to the muscles of the tongue. DISSECTION OF THE EYE. Since the human eye cannot be obtained sufficiently fresh for anatomical purposes, we must have recoinse to the eyes of animals, —say of the sheep or the pig. The first thing to be done is to remove the conjunctival coat, together with the loose cellular tissue which unites it to the sclerotica. Membrana conjunctiva.—This is the mucous membrane which lines the eyelids, and is reflected over the sclerotic coat of the eye by a loose fold, so as not to impede the motions of the globe. The palpebral portion of it is very vascular, and provided with fine papillae.* The ocular portion has no papillae, and is nearly colour- less, except when inflamed; it then becomes intensely vascular and red, like a piece of scarlet cloth. An abundant supply of nerves has been bestowed upon the membrane for the purpose of giving it that exquisite degree of sensibility necessary to guard the eye. A thin layer of conjunctiva covers the cornea or transparent part of the eye. True, it cannot be separated by dissection in recent eyes; hut the corneal conjunctiva possesses the same acute sensi- bility as the rest of it; changes produced by inflammation of the * These papillae were first pointed out by Eble, Ueber den Bau und die Krankeiten des Bindehaut dts Auges.

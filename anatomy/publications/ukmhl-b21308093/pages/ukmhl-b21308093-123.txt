THE DISSECTION OF THE NECK. An incision, not dividing more than the thickness of the skin, should be made down the middle of the neck from the lower jaw to the sternum ; a second along the clavicle to the acromion ; and a third along the base of the jaw as far back as the mastoid process of the temporal bone. Reflect the skin from the front and side of the neck, and a broad thin plane of muscular fibres, called the Platysma myoides, will be exposed. Between this and the skin there is a layer of adipose and cellular tissue, (some- times called the superficial fascia), varying in thickness in different subjects, hut generally more abundant at the upper part of the neck, especially in corpulent individuals, in whom it occasions the well-known appearance of a double chin. 1. The name Platysma myoides is given to a broad cuta- neous muscle which covers the side of the neck. It arises by pale and scattered fibres in the subcutaneous tissue in front of the pectoralis major and deltoid muscles; thence proceeding upwards and inwards over the clavicle and along the side of the neck, the fibres become rather more closely aggregated, and terminate in the following manner:â€”The anterior cross those of the opposite platysma, immediately below the symphysis of the lower jaw, and are lost in the skin of the chin ; those next in order, to which we would draw particular attention, are attached to the base of the jaw, to the extent of an inch, more or less ; while the pos- terior ascend over the masseter muscle, and terminate partly in the subcutaneous tissue of the cheek, partly by mixing with the muscles at the corner of the mouth. In the human subject the action of this muscle is very limited. We can best understand it by putting it in action in our own person. It is undoubtedly a muscle of expression. It can wrinkle the skin of the neck, as in the more violent passions, or co-operate with other muscles in giving a melancholy cast to the countenance G

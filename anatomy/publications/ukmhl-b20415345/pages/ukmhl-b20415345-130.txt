128 SURGICAL ANATOMY. and the subclavian vein ; behind it are the recurrent laryngeal nerve, the cord of the sympathetic nerve with its middle and inferior cardiac branches, the longus cdlli muscle, the transverse process of the seventh cervical or first thoracic vertebra, from which it is separated by a small (quantity of cellular tissue and fat, and the apex of the lung, covered with pleura. The left subclavian, the longer of the two arteries, arises from the transverse portion of the arch of the aorta opposite the third thoracic vertebra. Its first portion ascends almost vertically to the inner margin of the first rib and the inner border of the insertion of the anterior scalene muscle. Only the relations of the cervical part of this portion of the artery will be described here. The cervical part of the first portion is covered by the skin, the superficial fascia, the platysma myoides muscle, the superficial layer of the deep fascia, the sterno-mastoid muscle, the anterior jugular vein, the sterno-hj'oid and sterno-thyroid muscles, the posterior process of the deep fascia, continued forward from in front of the scaleni muscles, the sternal end of the clavicle, the left internal jugular vein, the vertebral and sub- clavian veins, the apex of the left lung and its pleura, the phrenic nerve, and the cardiac branches of the sympathetic nerve, which lie parallel with the arter}', the left common carotid artery, and the thoracic duct. On its outer side are the apex of the lung and pleura; on its inner side are the trachea, the recurrent laryngeal nerve, the esophagus, and the thoracic duct; behind it are the pleura and the apex of the left lung, while behind and internal to it are the thoracic duct, the esophagus, the inferior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic nerve, the sympathetic cord, the longus colli muscle, and the spinal column. Differences Between the Right and Left Subclavian Arteries in Their First Por- tion.â€”The first portion of the left subclavian artery differs from the first portion of the right in the following respects: The left subclavian arises directly from the arch of the aorta, while the right arises from the innominate artery ; it lies deeper, is longer and more vertical; it is in relation with the esophagus and the thoracic duct, while the right is not; it is crossed by the left innominate or brachio-cephalic vein, the phrenic and pneumogastric nerves, and the cardiac branches of the sym- pathetic nerve running almost parallel with it; on the right side the phrenic and pneumogastric nerves and some of the cardiac branches of the sympathetic nerve pass in front of the right subclavian artery, at nearly a right angle. The left subclavian artery is not in so close a relation with the recurrent laryngeal nerve as is the right subclavian, the nerve winding around below the latter. In the follow- ing description of the course of the thoracic duct it will be seen to be in relation with the first portion of the left subclavian artery at two points; it holds, of course, no relation to the right subclavian artery. The thoracic duct passes upward and out of the chest to the left of the

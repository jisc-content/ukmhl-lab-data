403 OF THE CLAVICLE. C c 2 bone are contiguous *, and are connected by a firm ligament f. From this, a rough plain surface is extended outwards, where the pectoral muscle has part of its origin. Behind, the bone is made fiat and rough by the insertion of the larger share of the subclavian muscle. After the clavicle begins to be bended backwards, it is round, but soon after becomes broad and thin ; which shape it retains to its external end. Along the external concavi- ty, a rough sinuosity runs, from which some part of the deltoid muscle takes its rise ; Opposite to this, on the convex edge, a scabrous ridge gives insertion to a share of the cucullaris muscle. The upper surface of the clavicle here is flat; but the lower is hollow, for lodging the beginning of the musculus subclavius ; and towards its back-part a tubercle rises, to which, and a roughness near it, the strong short ligament connecting this bone to the coracoid process of the scapula is fixed. The external end:); of this bone is horizontally oblong, smooth, sloping at the posterior side, and tipped in a recent subject with a cartilage, for its articulation with the acromion scapulae. Round this, the bone is spongy, for the firmer connexion of the ligaments. The triangular unequal interior end of‘each •* Dionis, Sixieme Demonst. des Os. I Weitbrecht, Syndesmolog, sect. 2, I. § 7,

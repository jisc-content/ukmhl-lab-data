The internal surface of the ossa temporum is un- equal ; the upper circular edge of the squamous part having- numerous small ridges and furrows for its conjunction with the parietal bones ; and the rest of it is irregularly marked with the con- volutions of the middle-part of the brain, and with furrows made by the branches of the arteries of the dura mater. •From the under-part of this internal surface, a large transverse hard craggy protuberance runs horizontally inwards and forwards, with a sharp edge above, and two flat sides, one facing oblique- ly forwards and outwards, and the other as much backwards and inwards. To the ridge between these two sides, the large lateral process of the dura mater is fixed. Sometimes a small bone, a-kin to the sesamoid, is found between the small end of this petrous pro- cess, and the sphenoid bone *. Towards the back-part of the inside of the os temporum, a large deep fossa is conspicuous, where the lateral sinus lies; and frequently on the top • Riolan, Comment, de Ossib, cap. S2.

OF THE OSSA PARIETALIA. 281 makes a depression near the angle formed by the lower and posterior, sides of these bones; and the pits made by the prominent parts of the brain are to be seen in no part of the skull more frequent, or more considerable, than in the internal surface of the parietal bones. The ossa parietalia are amongst the thinnest bones of the cranium. These bones are joined at their fore-side to the os frontis by the coronal suture ; at their long in- ferior angles, to the sphenoidal bone, by part of the suture of this name ; at their lower edge, to the ossa temporum, by the squamous suture and its posterior additamentum ; behind, to the os oc- cipitis, or ossa triquetra, by the lambdoid suture ; and above, to one another, by the sagittal suture. In a child born at the full time, none of the sides of this bone are completed ; and there never is a hole in the ossified part of it near to the sagit- tal suture. A large unossified ligamentous part of the cra- nium is observable between the parietal bones, and the middle of the divided os frontis *of new- born children, called by the vulgar the open of the head, bregma * or Jons piilsatUis, on account of the pulsation of the brain felt through this flex- ible ligamentous cartilaginous substance. Hence very frequently the parietal bones are called ossa bi'egmatis. * Palpitans"vertex, folioliim, folium, triangularis lacuna.

OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 264 ly forwards, and also the lower part of the coronal suture already taken notice of, may all be justly said to pertain to the squamous suture. The squa- mous form is also more convenient here ; because such thin edges of bones, when accurately applied one to another, have scarce any rough surface, to obstruct or hurt the muscle in its contraction; which is still further provided for, by the manner of laying these edges on each other; for, in view- ing their outside, we see the temporal bones co- vering the sphenoidal and parietal, and this last supporting the sphenoidal, while both mount on the frontal: From which disposition it is evident, that while the temporal muscle is contracting, which is the only time it presses strongly in its motion on the bones, its fibres slide easily over the external edges. Another advantage still in this is, that all this bony part is made stronger by the bones thus supporting each other. The bones of the skull are joined to those of the face, by schyndeksis and sutures. The schyndelesis is in the partition of the nose. The sutures said to be common to the cranium and face are five, viz. the ethmoidal^ sphenoidal, trans- *oerse, and two zygomatic. The ethmoidal and sphenoidal sutures surround the bones of these names *, and in some places help to make up other sutures, particularly the squamous and transverse ; and in other parts there is but one suture common to these two bones.

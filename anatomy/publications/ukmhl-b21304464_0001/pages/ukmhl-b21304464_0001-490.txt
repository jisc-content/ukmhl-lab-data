OUTLINES or ANATOMY, 4.62 fore-arm into four tendons, which are fixed into the posterior part of all the bones of the fingers. By this muscle the fingers are extended. Epitrochlo-Phalangeus, or Flexor Digitorum Sublimis Pej'J'oratus. This muscle takes its origin from the internal condyle of the os humeri, and from the coronoid process of the ulna, and also from the fore-part of the radius. The muscle divides into four tendons, which pass' under the anterior annular ligament, and are inserted into the second phalanx of the fingers; and at the first phalanx, the tendons are perforated by those of the flexor digitorum pro- fundus. Palmo-Phalangeus, or Lumbricalis. These four muscular slips are connected to the tendons of the last-named muscle ; and at the un- der ends of the metacarpal bones, they send off small tendons, which are fixed into the tendons of the interossei muscles, about the middle of the first phalanx. These muscles have but little effect; they in- crease the power of the flexors of the fingers. Cubito-Sub-Unguialis, or Flexor Digitorum Profundus. This muscle arises from the upper part of the ulna, and from the interosseous ligaments; it is placed behind the flexor sublimis, and divides into

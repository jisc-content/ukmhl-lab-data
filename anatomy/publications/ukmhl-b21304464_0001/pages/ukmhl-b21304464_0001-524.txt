OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 496 and both are exactly adapted to the pulley of the os femoris, on which they are placed in the most ordinary unstraining postures of the leg ; but when the leg is much bended, the rotula descends far down on the condyles ; and when the leg is fully extended, the rotula rises higher in its upper part than the pulley of the thigh-bone. The plain smooth surface is surrounded by a rough prominent edge, to which the capsular liga- ment adheres : Below, the point of the bone is sca- brous, where the strong tendinous ligament from the tubercle of the tibia is fixed. The upper horizontal part of this bone is flatted and unequal, where the tendons of the extensors of the leg are inserted. The substance of the rotula is cellular, with very thin external firm plates; But then these cells are so small, and such a quantity of bone is employ- ed in their formation, that scarce any bone of its bulk is so strong. Beside, it is covered with a thick ligament, (as it was observed, that this sort of bones generally is,) to connect its substance, and is moveable to one side or other ; therefore is sufficiently strong to resist the ordinary actions of the large muscles that are inserted into it, or any common external force applied to it * ; while a fix- ed process, such as the olecranon, would not have been sufficient to bear the whole weight of our * Vid.

OF THE FRONTAL SINUSES. 275 The diploe is also exhausted in that part above the eye-brows, where the two tables of the bone separate, by the external being protruded out- wards, to form two large cavities, called sinus frontales *. These are divided by a middle per- pendicular bony partition. Their capacities in the same subject are seldom equal; in some the right, in others the left is largest. And in differ- ent bones their size is as inconstant; nay, I have examined some, where they were entirely want- ing ; which oftener happens in such as have a flat fore-head, and whose sagittal suture is continued down to the nose, than in others f. In some skulls, besides the large perpendicular septum, there are several bony pillars, or short partitions found in each sinus ; in others these are wanting. For the most part the septum is entire ; at other times it is discontinued, and the two minuses communicate. When the sinuses aie seen in such skulls as have the frontal bone divided by the sa- gittal suture, the partition dividing these cavities, is evidently composed of two plates, wdiich easily separate. Each sinus commonly opens by a round- ish small hole, at the inner and lower part of the internal angular processes, into a sinus formed in the nose, at the upper and back part of the os un- guis ; near to which there are also some other * For a more particular account of these sinuses, vid.

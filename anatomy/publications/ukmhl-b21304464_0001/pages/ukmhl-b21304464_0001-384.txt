There are some of the causes of these very re- markable differences in the skull which may be readily explained. The form of the skull is determined by the soft parts, in proof of which, the internal table of the skull takes the exact impression of the convolu- tions of the brain and cerebellum, of the glands of Pacchioni, of the ramifications of the arteries of the dura mater, and its external surface displays impressions of the action of the external muscles, as well as traces of the form of the features *• * As the internal table of the skull only bears the impression of the convolutions of the brain and cerebellum, hence the external surface of the skull is not elevated by any part of the surface of the brain.

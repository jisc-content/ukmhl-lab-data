OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 296 dura mater, which empties itself into the lateral sinus*. The holes of this bone are commonly five pro- per, and two common to it and to the temporal bones. The first of the proper holes, called f ora- men magnum f from its size, is immediately be- hind the wedge-like process, and allows a passage to the medulla oblongata, nervi accessorii, to the vertebral arteries, and sometimes to the vertebral veins. At each side of this great hole, near its fore-part, and immediately above the condyles, we always find a hole, sometimes two, which soon unite again into one that opens externally \ through these the ninth pair of nerves go out of the skull. The fourth and fifth holes pierce from behind the condyle of each side into the fossae of the lateral sinuses ; they serve for the passage of the cervical veins to these sinuses. Often one of these holes is wanting, sometimes both, when the veins pass through the great foramen. Besides these five, we frequently meet with other holes near the edges of this bone, for the transmission of veins ; but their number and diameter are very uncertain. The two common foramina are the large irre- gular holes, one in each side, between the sides of the cuneiform process, and the edges of the pe- trous bones. In a recent subject, a strong mem- brane runs cross from one side to the other of each * Albin. de Ossib. ยง 65. 'J' Rachitidis, Medwllae spinalis.

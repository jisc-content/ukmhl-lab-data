OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. â™¦ Vid. PUte IS. 1(52 The muscles fixed into the superior piece of the broken bone, may bring about a separation of the fractured pieces; as, when the thigh-bone is broken below the small trochanter, the iliac and psoas muscles draw the upper broken piece up- wards and inwards. When the fractured pieces are not in contact with each other, there is a luxuriant growth of callus *, or an imperfect union takes place, and a new joint is formed. ' In cases of complicated fracture, the neigh- bouring soft parts are much injured, and some- times this fracture is combined with a luxation. General obserwtions on Luxations. By this term is understood, the displacement of bone froni its usual situation, In different joints, there is a diversity of struc- ture, accommodated to the motion which that joint is capable of performing. In order to form an accurate opinion respecting the different kinds of luxation, and the method of replacing the dislocated bones, an exact anatomical knowledge, not only of the structure of the joint, but also of the motion it is capable of performing,j and of the position of the neighbouring muscles, is required.

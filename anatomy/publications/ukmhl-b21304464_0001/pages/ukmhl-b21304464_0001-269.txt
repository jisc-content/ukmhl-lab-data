OF THE RIBS. 241 i fication however begins frequently at the external surface. The greatest alternate motions of the cartilages being made at their great curvature, that part remains frequently cartilaginous, after • all the rest is ossified*. The ribs are articulated at each end, of which the one behind is doubly joined to the vertebrae ; for the head is received into the cavities of two bodies of the vertebrae, and the larger tubercle is received 'into the depression in the transverse pro- ' cess of the lower vertebra. This double articula- tion, admits of motion upwards and downwards only, since the transverse process hinders the rib to be thrust back; the resistance on the other side of the sternum, prevents the rib’s coming forward; and each of the two joints with the other parts at- tached, oppose its turning round. It is likewise evident, that even the motion upwards and down- wards can be but small in any one rib gt the arti- culation itself. But as the ribs advance forwards, the distance from their centre of motion increasing, the motion must be more extensive ; and it would be very conspicuous at their anterior ends, were not they resisted there by the cartilages, which yield so little, that the principal motion is per- formed by the middle part of the ribs, which turns outwards and upwards, and occasions the twist re- markable in the long ribs at the place near their ' fore-end where they are most resisted f. * Havers, Osteolog. nov.

OF THE TIBIA 489 Straight; but turns first inwards, then outwards, and lastly inwards again. The plain internal side is smooth and equal, being little subjected to the actions of muscles ; but the external side is hollowed above by the tibialis anticus, and below by the extensor digi- torum longus and extensor pollicis longus. The two angles behind these sides are rounded by the action of the muscles; the posterior side compre- hended between them, is not so broad as those already mentioned, but is more oblique and flat- ted by the action of the tibialis posticus and flexor digitorum longus. Some way above the middle of the bone, the internal angle terminates. Near to this, the passage of the medullary vessels is seen slanting obliquely downwards. The lower end of the tibia is made hollow, and a small protuberance rises from its middle. The internal side of this cavity, which is smooth, and, in a recent subject, is covered with cartilage, is prolonged into a considerable process, commonly named malleolus internus * ; the point of which is divided by a notch, and from it ligaments are sent out to the foot. The internal malleolus is situated more forwards than the internal condyle of the up- per end of this bone ; which is necessary to be remembered in reducing aâ€˜ fracture of the leg -{-. * Tria-er, Talus, clavicula, clavilla Interior, clavilla do-' mestica. t Winslow, Exposition Anatomique des Os secs.

Towards the base of the skull, the temporal bone appears very irregular and unequal; and this part, instead of being broad, and placed per- pendicularly, as the others are, is contracted into an oblong very hard substance, extended horizon- tally forwards * and inwards, which in its pro- gress becomes smaller, and is commonly called os petrosum. Three external processes of each temporal bone are generally described. The first placed at the lower and hind part of the bone, from its resemblance to a nipple, is cal- led mastoides or marmnillaris. It is not solid, but within is composed of cancelli, or small cells, which have a communication with the large cavi- ty of the ear, the drum ; and therefore sounds, being multiplied in this vaulted labyrinth, are in- creased, before they are applied to the immediate organ of hearing. Into the mastoid process, the sternomastoideus muscle is inserted : and to its back-part, where the surface is rough, the trache- lomastoideus, and part of the splenius arc fixed. About an inch farther forward, the second pro- cess begins to rise out from the bone ; and having its origin continued obliquely downwards and for- wards for some way, it becomes smaller, and is stretched forwards to join with the os malts ; they * Aldin. de Ossib. ยง 26.

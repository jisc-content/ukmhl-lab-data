MUSCLES OF THE TRUNK OF THE BODY. 387 tendons, and serves to pull the spine obliquely backwards. Besides the above muscles, there are two rows of muscular fibres between the spinous processes, and also between the transverse processes, called INTER-SPINALES and INTER-TRANSVERSALES, and there are also muscular and tendinous fibres which arise from the spinous processes of the os sacrum, from the oblique and transverse processes of the lumbar and dorsal vertebrae ; and from the four lowest cervical vertebrae, and these fibres are fixed by distinct tendons into the spinous pro- cesses of all the vertebrae, with the exception of the first, and constitute the multifidm spirux of some authors. These muscular fibres draw the spine directly backwards. Sect. II* OF THE MUSCLES WHICH MOVE THE HEAD. Movements of the Head. The head is articulated with the atlas, or first vertebra of the neck, by ?Lginglymus joints on which it is moved backwards and forwards. The head, (as has been before described), is al- so connected with the second vertebra of the neck, Bba

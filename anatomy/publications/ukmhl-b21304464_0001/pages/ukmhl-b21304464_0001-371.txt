OF THE LOWER JAW. 343 musculi depressores labii inferioris, and the leva- tores labii inferioris, depress the bone ; And be- . low these prints, a small rising may be observed, where the depressores commence. On the back-part of the chin, sometimes three, always two, small protuberances appear in the middle. To the uppermost, when it is seen, the fraenum of the tongue is connected. Front the middle one, the musculi genioglossi riseand from the lowest, the geniohyoidei have their ori- gin. Below the last, we see two rough sinuosi- ties formed by the digastric muscles. At the lower and fore-part of the external sur- face of each side of the lower jaw, a small emi- nence may be observed, where the depressor la- biorum communis rises. Near the upper edge of the side a ridge runs lengthwise, to which the under part of the musculus buccinator is con- nected. Internally, towards the upper edge of each side, another ridge appears, from which the mylohyoidei have their origin, and to which the internal membrane of the gums adheres. In the upper edge of both chin and sides, are a great many deep pits or sockets, for receiving the roots of the teeth. The number and magnitude of these sockets are various, became of the different number, as well of the teeth themselves, as of their roots, in different people. These sockets in the lower jaw, as well as in the upper one, are less deep as old age comes on ; when freed from the teeth by any Y4

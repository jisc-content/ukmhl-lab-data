44 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. produced from the membrane into them; and, af- ter a successful injection of the arteries with a red liquor, numerous vessels are not only seen on the periosteum *, but most of the fibres sent from tnc membrane to the bone, shew themselves to be vessels entering it, with the injected liquor in them ; and when they are broken, by tearing off the periosteum, the surface of the bone is almost' covered with red points. The veins corresponding to these arteries are sometimes to be seen in subjects that die with their vessels full of blood ; though such numerous ramifications of them, as of the arteries, can sel- dom be demonstrated, because few of them natu- rally contain coloured liquors, and such liquors can with difficulty be injected into them. This however is sometimes done f. The great sensibility of the periosteum in the deep-seated species of paronychia, in exostoses, nodi, tophi, and gummata, from a lues venerea, or whenever this membrane is in an inflamed state, is a sufficient proof that it is well provided with nerves, though they are perhaps too small to be traced upon it; and therefore one cannot well de- termine, whether they are sent along with the ar- teries in the common way, or are derived from the * Ruysch.

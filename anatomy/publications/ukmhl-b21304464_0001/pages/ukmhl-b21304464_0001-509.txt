OF THE THIGH. 481 continued from the capsular, enter, and are there- by securely fixed to it; and round the root of the neck, where it rises from the bone, a rough ridge is found, where the capsular ligament of the arti- culation itself is connected. Below the back-part of this root, the large un- equal protuberance, called trochanter major, stands out •, the external convex part of which, is divided into three different surfaces; that on the fore-part is scabrous and rough, for the insertion of the glu- taeus minimus *, but the superior one into which the glutaeus medius is inserted, is smooth ; and that behind is made flat and smooth by the tendon of the glutaeus maximus passing over it. The upper edge of this process is sharp and pointed at its back-part, where the glutaeus medius is fixed •, but forwards it is more obtuse, and has two superficial pits formed in it: Into the supe- rior of these, the piriformis is implanted ; and the obturator internus and gemini are fixed into the lower one. From the posterior prominent part of this great trochanter, a rough ridge runs backwards and downwards, into which the quadratus is insert- ed. In the deep hollow, at the internal upper side of this ridge, the obturator externus is implanted. More internally, a conoid process, called trochan- ter minor, rises for the insertion of the musculus psoas, and iliacus internus, and the pectineus, is VOL. I. H h

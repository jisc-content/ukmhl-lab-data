In some skulls indeed the indentations here are as conspicuous externally as in other sutures * * * § ; and what is com- monly called the posterior part of this squamous suture, always has the evident serrated form ; and therefore is reckoned by some f a distinct suture, under the name of additainenLu.ni posLerius sutum squamosce.

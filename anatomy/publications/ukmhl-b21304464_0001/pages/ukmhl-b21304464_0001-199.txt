GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORGA- NIC DISEASES OF THE SYNOVIAL APPARATUS. HE Synovial Apparatus is frequently much in- jured by external violence, so as to become great- ly inflamed. In cases of sprains, bruises, rheumatism and gout, an unnatural quantity of a clear viscid li- quor is secreted within the joints, especially with- in the knee-joint. The contents of these swellings are various, ac- cording to the cause of the disease. In cases of rheumatism, the contents are thin, and very fluid ; in scrofula they are much thicker, and from external violence, blood or cartilagi- nous bodies are contained within the joint.

OF THE SPINE. 211 of motion which the other parts of the bones al- low, or the muscles can perTorm ; Yet as these ob- lique processes are small, and therefore not cap- able of so secure a conjunction as the larger bo- dies, they may sooner yield to a disjoining force; but then their dislocation is not of nearly so bad consequence as the separation of the bodies would be. For, by the oblique processes being dislocat- ed, the muscles, ligaments, and spinal marrow are indeed stretched ; but this marrow must be com- pressed, or entirely destroyed, when the body of the vertebra is removed out of its place. liaise Vertebra. The False Vertebra compose the under pyra- mid of the spine. They are distinguished from the bones already described justly enough by this epithet oi false; because though each bone into which they can be divided in young people re- sembles the true vertebrae in figure, yet none of them contribute to the motion of the trunk of the body ; they being intimately united to each other in adults, except at their lower part, where they are moveable ; whence they are com- monly divided into two bones, os sacrum, and os coccygis. All the tranverse processes are united into one large strong oblong process on each side ; which ^so far as it answers to the first three bones, is very O 2

1 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. angles ABL and BAL of the isosceles triangle, ABL must be larger than a right angle, and of course larger than the angle LBN ; and therefore, as the side of a triangle which subtends the largest angle must be longer than either of the two other sides of the triangle, the side BN must be longer than LN ; and therefore the oblique muscle has not lost one-fifth of its length, or has performed, with a smaller decurtation of its fibres, the same extent of motion as the straight muscle of the same length with it. 7. On the same principles, we can prove that the extent of motion increases with the degree of the obliquity of the muscles. Thus, suppose that the oblique muscles AM and AL, (See PI. 3. fig. 6'.), after bringing the point A down to B, continue to act till they have brought the point B down to C, it appears that they are less shortened in this second action than they were in their first action; for on comparing together the two triangles BGL and CHL, the angles at G and H are equal, be- cause the lines BG and CH are parallel to each other ; but the angle HLC being larger than the angle GLB, it follows, that the angle GBL is a larger angle than the angle HCL, and therefore, that the side GL which subtends it, bears a larger proportion to the side BL than HL does to CL; that is, the decurtation of the oblique muscle will be less in its second action than in its first; or

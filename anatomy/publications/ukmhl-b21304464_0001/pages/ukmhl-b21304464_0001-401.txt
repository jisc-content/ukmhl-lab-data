OF THE OSSIFICATION IN THE SUTURES. 373 Morgagni * informs us, that even the other bones of the body partake of the disease, and are much altered in shape. Such a change, I believe, rarely occurs ; although I have no doubt, that in almost all cases of hydrocephalus chronicus, the bones of the skeleton are, as the soft parts, of a more slender form, thinner and smaller than usual; or that, even supposing the head of the usual size, the rest of .the body will be found not to bear the same proportion to it as in a healthy child. Obso'mfions on the Smaller Varieties in the Form of the Skull, and on Craniometers. From what has been stated respecting the form of the skull, and also respecting the various causes which determine its particular shape, it is evident, that the shape of the skull may be readily altered by a great variety of causes; as by external injury, by particular posture, or by disease.

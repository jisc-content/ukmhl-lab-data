220 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. one third of the great cavity into which the head of the thigh-bone is received. The external side of this bone is unequally con- vex, and is called its dorsum ;—the internal con- cave surface is by some (but improperly) named its costa. ^ The semicircular edge at the highest part of this bone, which is tipped with a cartilage in the re- cent subject, is named the spine, into which the external or descending oblique muscle of the abdo- men is inserted ; and from it the internal ascend- ing oblique and the transverse muscles of the belly, with the glutaeus maximus, quadratus lumborum, and latissimus dorsi, have their origin. Some* are of opinion, that it is only the tendinous crust of all these muscles, and not a cartilage, as com- monly alleged, that covers tliis bony edge. The ends of the spine are more prominent than the surface of the bone below them ; therefore are reckoned processes. From the anterior spinal process, the sartorius and fascialis f muscles have their rise, and the outer end of the doubled tendon of the external oblique muscle of the abdomen, commonly called Fallopius’s or Poupait’s ligament, or Crural arch, is fixed to it.—The inside of the posterior spinal process, and of part of the spine forward from * Winslow, Exposition anatomique du coips humain, traits des os frais, § 96. t Tensor vaginae femoris.

OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 324 side straight, and the other sloping. Between the two orbitar angles, there is a concave arch, which makes about a third of the external circumference of the orbit, from which a fifth process is extend- ed backwards within the orbit, to form near one- third of that cavity ; and hence it may be called the internal orbitar process. From the lower edge of each of the ossa malarum, which is be- tween the maxillary and zygomatic processes, the masseter muscle takes its origin; and from the exterior part of the zygomatic process, the mus- culus distorter oris rises ; in both which places the â€¢urface of the bone is rough. On the external surface of each cheek-bone, one or more small holes arc commonly found, for the transmission of small nerves or bloodvessels from, and sometimes into the orbit. On the in- ternal surface are the holes for the passage of the nutritious vessels of these bones. Aj notch on the outside of the internal orbitar process of each of these bones, assists to form the great slit common to this bone, and to the sphenoid, maxillary, and palate bones. The substance of these bones is, in proportion to their bulk, thick, hard, and solid, with some cancelli. Each of the ossa malarum is joined, by its su- perior and internal orbitar processes, to the os frontis, and to the orbitar process of the sphenoid bone, by the transverse suture. By the edge be- tween the internal and inferior orbitar processes.

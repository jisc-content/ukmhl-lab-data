102 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. distance eight times greater from the elbow-joint; hence, if 50 lbs. can be raised on the hand, it is with a force with which 400 lbs. could have been raised, had the muscle been applied to the extre- mity of the hand. Further, as the biceps and brachialis internus pull their origins downwards, with as much force as their insertions upwards, it is evident, that if we suppose these muscles to be thrown over a pulley, they could raise 400 Ihs. at each end, or in all 800 lbs., a weight which would certainly have torn these muscles in a dead person •, so prodigious is the diflerence between the strength of the muscles in the living and the dead. In the living body, by a sudden exertion, the ten- dons are more frequently lacerated than the flesh ; but in the dead body, the belly of the muscle is generally torn j and I have observed, that when the inferior extremities had not been laid straight after death, as in the bodies of persons that had been hanged, and had become rigid in that bend- ed posture, the muscles were torn by extending the lixTibs; and the rigidity which had taken place must probably have shortened and fixed all the fleshy fibres equally, so that we can scarcely suppose that one fibre was torn after another. It has been attempied by Mr Graham, Dr DbSAGULiERs, Mr Le Roy, and Mr Regnier*, * Vid.

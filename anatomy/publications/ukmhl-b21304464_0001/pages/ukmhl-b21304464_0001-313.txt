OF THE OSSA TEMPORUM. 285 times is composed of two or three distinct pieces. Round the root of it,^ especially at the fore-part,. there is a remarkable rising of the os petrosum, which some have esteemed a process ; and, from / the appearance it makes with the styliform, have named it vaginalis. Others again have, under the name of auditory process, reckoned among the ex- ternal processes that semicircular ridge, which, running between the root of the mastoid and zygomatic processes, forms the under-part of the external meatus auditorius. The sinuosities or depressions on the external surface of each os temporum. are these: A long fossa at the inner and back-part of the root of the mammary process, where the posterior head of the digastric muscle has its origin. Immediately before the root of the zygomatic process, a con- siderable hollow is left, for lodging the crotaphite muscle. Between the zygomatic, auditory and vaginal processes, a large cavity is formed; through the middle of which, from top to bottom, a fissure is observable, into which part of the ligament that se- cures the articulation of the lower jaw with this bone is fixed. The fore-part of the cavity being lined witli the same cartilage which covers the tubercle be- fore it, receives the condyle of the jaw ; and in the back-part, a. small share of the parotid gland, and a cellular fatty substance, are lodged.

301 OF THE OS ETHMOIDES. holes are so closely lined by the dura mater, that they are much less conspicuous than in the skele- ton. From the middle of the internal side of this plate, a thick process rises upwards, and, being highest at the fore-part, gradually becomes lower, as it is extended backwards. From some resem- blance which this process was imagined to have to a cockâ€™s comb, it has been called crista galli * ; the falx is connected to its ridge, and to the im- perforated part of the cribriform plate. When the crista is broken, its base is sometimes found to be hollow, with its cavity opening into the nose -j-. Immediately before the highest part of this pro* cess, is the blind hole of the frontal-bone, which, as was formerly remarked, is often in a good mea- sure formed by a notch in the fore-part of the root of the crista. Porro canaliculi, de quibus sermo est, quoniam non omnes in suprema narium cavitate desinunt, neque eadem incedunt direc- tione, neque demum per eamdem narium regionem feruntur: ita opportunum, et naturae consonum videtur, turn singulos, turn universes in tres classes distinguere; nimirum in eos, qui ab interna laminae ethmoideae facie initio ducto, laminae ejusdem crassitudinem longitudine vix pxcedunt; in eos qui ulterius elongati per septum narium descendant; in eos denique qui per turbinatorum ossium superiorum lamellas feruntur * Verruca praedura, septum ossis spongiosi. + Palfyn.

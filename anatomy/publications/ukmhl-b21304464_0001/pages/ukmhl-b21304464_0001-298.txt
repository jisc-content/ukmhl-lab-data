OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 270 In each of the orbitar processes, behind the mid- dle of the superciliary ridges, a considerable si- nuosity is observed, where the glandula innomma- ta Galeni or lachrymalis is lodged. Behind each internal angular process, a small pit may be remarked, where the cartilaginous pully of the musculus obliquus major of the eye is fixed. Betwixt the two orbitar processes, there is a large discontinuation of the bone, into which the cribriform part of the os ethmoid.es is incased. The frontal bone frequently has little caverns formed in it here, where it is joined to the ethmoid bone. Behind each external angular process, the surface of the frontal bone is considerably de- pressed, where part of the temporal muscle is placed. The foraminay or lioleSy observable on the ex- ternal surface of the frontal bone, are three in each side. There is one in each superciliary ridge, a little removed from its middle towards the nose ; through which a twig of the ophthalmic branch of the fifth pair of nerves passes out of the orbit, with a small artery from the internal carotid, to be dis- tributed to the teguments and muscles of the fore-head. These vessels, in some skulls, make furrows in the os frontis, especially in the bones of children, as has also been observed of another considerable

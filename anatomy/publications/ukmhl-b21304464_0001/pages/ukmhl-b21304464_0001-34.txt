The processes of this mem- brane enter into the transverse pores of the bones, where probably they are continued, to support the marrow distributed through the substance of the bones ; and along with them vessels are sent, as from the external periosteum, into the bone *, These processes being of a very delicate texture, the adhesion of this membrane to the bone is so small, that it commonly separates more easily from the bone than from the mar- row contained in the bone.

15/ DISEASES OF BONES. Fragility of the Bones. The bones sometimes contain an excess of earthy matter, and are extremely brittle. To this state they are reduced by old age, and by different diseases, the scurvy, lues, cancer, and more especially in the latter stages of those.dis- eases. The bones, in the latter stage of scurvy, as I)r Mead has well remarked, become so brittle, that they break from the slightest violence, and do not consolidate afterwards ; for even the callus is de- stroyed after it has been formed. Mr Boyer* informs us, that if the bones of a scorbutic person be boiled, the periosteum sepa- rates very soon, lamellae scale off, and in some cases the bones dissolve entirely. They also fall into powder, if kept for some in the inferior extremities. After having been in this very distressed situation for nine montlis, slie broke her thigh- bone by turning in bed. The fracture did not heal, though a surgeon applied the broken bones accurately to each other. The bones of the thigh became soft on that side, and then the bones of the other thigh. For the four last years of her life, she suffered very excruciating pain ; the softness and flexibility of her bones increased daily. Her breathing became difficult. Spine very crooked; she lost a foot of her height. Spleen was very large, liver very small. All the bones except the teeth were very soft; the periosteum was very thick. * Vid. his Lecturas on the Diseases of bones.

OF THE SPINE. 189 • Galen, de usu part. lib. 12. cap. 12. bra", through which the nerves that proceed from the spinal marrow and its bloodvessels pass. Articulations.—The articulations then of these true vertebrce are plainly double ; for their bodies are joined by the intervening cartilage above de- scribed, and their oblique processes being tipped with cartilages, are so connected by their ligaments, as to allow a small degree of motion to all sides. Hence, it is evident, that their centre of motion is altered in different positions of the trunk; For when we bow forwards, the upper moved part bears entirely on the bodies of the vertebra : If we bent back, the oblique processes support the weight; If we recline to one side, we rest upon the oblique processes of that side and part of the bodies: If we stand erect, all the bodies and ob- lique processes hqve their share in our support. Advantages.—Hence it follows, 1. That be- cause the joints of which the spine is composed, are so numerous, the spinal marrow, nerves, blood- vessels, &c. are- not liable to such compression and over-stretching in the motion of the trunk of the body, as they would otherwise be, since seve- ral vertebra must be concerned in every motion of the spine ; and therefore a very small curvature is made at the conjunction of any two vertebra *. 2. That an erect posture is the surest and firmest, because the surface of contact of the fulcra is largest, and the weight is most perpendicular to

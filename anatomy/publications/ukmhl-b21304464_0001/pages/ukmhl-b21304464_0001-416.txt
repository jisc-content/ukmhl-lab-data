By the three following muscles, the head is drawn backwards, or to a side, when the muscle of one side only is thrown into action : Cervico-Mastoideus, or Spknus Capitis. This muscle is placed between the trapezius and complexus major \ it is flat, and somewhat like a surgeonâ€™s splent in form. It arises from the spinous processes of the four uppermost dorsal ver- tebrae, and five lowest cervical vertebrae ; and pro- ceeding upwards, is fixed into the occipital ridge and mastoid process of the temporal bone, and also into the transverse processes of the five uppermost cervical vertebrae. , Trachelo-Occipitalis, Biventer Cervicis of Al- binos, or Complexus Major. This muscle arises, by tendons, from the trans- verse processes of the four lower cervical vertebrae, and seven uppermost dorsal vertebi'ce. It forms a thick fleshy mass, in the middle of which there

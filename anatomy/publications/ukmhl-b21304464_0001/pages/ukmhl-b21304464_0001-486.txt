This muscle arises from a ridge of the os hurneri above the external condyle of the os humeri, and is inserted by means of a long tendon into the lower head of the radius, which it moves from within outwards upon the ulna. Epicondylo-Radialis, or Supinator Radii Bre- vis. This muscle takes its origin from the external cpndyle of the os humeri, and from the outer and upper part of the ulna, and from the interosseous ligament: it is wrapt around the upper and fore- part of the radius, which it turns upon its axis. The supinator muscles are counteracted by two pronator muscles. f Rronator Muscles. Epitochlo-Radialis, or Pronator Radii TereSk This muscle takes its origin from the internal condyle of the os. humeri, and from the coronoid process of the ulna, and, becoming gradually smal- ler, it extends across the upper end of the flexor muscles of the wrist, and is fixed into the interior and upper part of the radius.-

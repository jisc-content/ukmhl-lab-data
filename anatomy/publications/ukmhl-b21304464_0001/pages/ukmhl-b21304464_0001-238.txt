OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 210 middlemost vertebrae of the loins are longest and thickest ; in the vertebrae above and below they are less; So that these processes of the first * and fifth -j- are the least, to prevent their striking on the ribs or ossa ilia, or their bruising the mus- cles in the motions of the spine. The epiphyses round the edges of the bodies of the lumbar x'crtebrce are most raised in the two lowest, which consequently make them appear hollower in the middle than the others are. The body of the fifth vertebra is rather thinner than that of the fourth.—The spinal process of this fifth is smaller, and the oblique processes face more backwards and forwards than in any other lumliar vertebrae. After consH.ering the structure of the particu- lar vertebrae, and their mutual connection, we ifiay observe a solicitous care taken that they shall not be disjoined, but with great difficulty : for besides being connected by strong ligaments pro- portioned to the forces which are to be resisted, their bodies either enter so into each other, as to prevent their being displaced any way,'as in the vertebras of the neck; or they are propped on all sides, as those of the back are by the ribs ; or their surfaces of contact are so broad, as to render the separation almost impracticable as in the luim ; while the depth and articulation of the oblique processes are exactly proportioned to the quantity * Nt^giTJ-, renalis. t Ae-x.»>.Ur,i, fulciens.

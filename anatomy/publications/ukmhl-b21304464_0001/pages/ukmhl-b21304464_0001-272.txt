" OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. these false ribs are shorter as the ribs descend *. To all these five ribs the circular edge of the diaphragm is connected ; and its fibres, instead of being stretched immediately transversly, and so running perpendicular to the ribs, are pressed so as to be often, especially in exspiration, parallel to the plane in which the ribs lie ; Nay, one may judge by the attachments which these fibres have so frequently to the sides of the thorax, a consider- able way above where their extremities are insert- ed into the ribs, and by the situation of the viscera, always to be observed in a dead subject laid supine, that there is constantly a large concavity formed on each side by the diaphragm within these bast- ard ribs, in which the stomach, liver, spleen, &c. are contained. Hence likewise we may learn how to judge bet- ,ter of the seat of several diseases, and to do the * My father discovered, that the cartilages between the ribs and the breast-bone, with the exception of the cartilage of the first rib, are not fixed to the sternum in the same manner as to the ribs ; for the rib which is hollowed, receives the cartilage, and is so firmly united to it, that in the recent subject, they can- not be separated without lacerating the cartilage; but the inner part of the ciu-tilage is tied by a capsular ligament to the edges of the pit of the sternum, and the concave part of tHe pit is con- nected by fine cellular threads only to the end of the cartilage, so that the cartilage and sternum, may, after cutting the capsu- lar ligament, be separated from each other ivilhout tearing the cartilaginous Jibres. Hence, when the ribs are moved, the cap- sular ligament is twisted, and the end of the cartilage rolls upon the sternum. Vid. Observations on the oblique muscles. Edin. Phil. Trans, vol. 3.

S56 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. or THE HEAD. By the head is meant all that spheroidal part which is placed above the first bone of the neck. It therefore comprehends the cranium and bones of thc^face. The cranium *, helmet, or brain-case, consists of several pieces ; which form a vaulted cavi- ty, for lodging and defending the brain and cerebellum, with their membranes, vessels, and nerves. The cavity of the cranium is proportioned to its contents. Hence such a variety of its size is observed in different subjects ; and hence it is neither so broad nor so deep at its fore-part, in which the anterior lobes of the brain are lodged, 'as it is behind where the posterior lobes of the brain and cerebellum are contained. From the peculiar figure of the skull, it is more capacious and stronger; from the flatness of the sides of the cranium, the sphere of vision is ex- tended, and the ears receive a greater quantity of sound, and are less exposed to injuries. Surfaces 0/ the Skull. The external surface of the upper part of the cranium is very smooth, and equal, being only co- * calva, calvaria, cerebri galea, theca & olla capitis, testa capitis, scutella capitis.

164 â€¢ OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. In the complete luxation, the bone is complete- ly displaced ; its articulating surfaces not being in contact. According to Petit and others, the capsular li- gament is merely stretched ; but a complete luxa- tion is generally attended by laceration of liga- ments. My Father, while a student in this University, made many experiments on this subject, and found that he could not imitate a luxation without a la- ceration of the ligaments, even after they had been steeped in tepid water for several hours; and he afterwards, upon dissecting the joints of persons Avho had died with dislocations, had the satisfac- tion of finding his former observations confirm- ed. There are some joints^ which can only be com- pletely luxated, as the hip-joint, as the smooth head of the thigh-bone is covered by cartilage, and lu- bricated by synovia, and it either slips from the brim of the acetabulum into its original situation, or into a new situation. By the incomplete dislocation, the head of the bone is offly partially displaced, and rests upon some part of the socket of the contiguous bone. Such luxations are most frequent at the elbow^ knee, and Joot.

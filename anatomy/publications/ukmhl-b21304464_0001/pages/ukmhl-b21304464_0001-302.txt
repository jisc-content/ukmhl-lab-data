OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 274 Immediately at the root of this ridge or furrow there is rr small hole, which sometimes pierces through the first table, and, in other skulls, opens into the superior sinus of the ethmoid bone within the nose. In it a little process of the falx is lodg- ed, and a small artery, and (Sometimes a vein runs * ; and the superior longitudinal sinus begins here. This hole, however, is often not entirely proper to the os frontis ; for in several skulls, the lower part of it is formed in the upper part of the base of the crista galli, which is a process of the ethmoid bone f. The os frontis is composed of two tables, and. an intermediate diploe, as the other bones of the cranium are, and, in a middle degree of thick- ness between the os occipitis and the parietal bones j is pretty equally dense all through, except at the orbitar processes, where, by the action of the eye on one side, and pressure of the lobes of the brain on the other, it is made extremely thin and diaphanous, and the meditullium is entirely obliterated. Since in this place there is so weak a defence for the brain, the reason appears why fencers esteem a push in the eye mortal .'ll. * MolioAGN. Adversar. 6. Animad. 31. t Inorass.

OUTLINED OF ANATOMY. 528 Sect. VI. MUSCLES OF THE ANCLE OR TARSUS, AND OF THE METATARSUS. The muscles which move the foot, may be di- vided into three classes : 1. Those which bend the foot. 2. Those which extend the foot by the medium of the tendo Achillis, and are the principal agents in walking, running, dancing, &c. 3. Those which lift the foot to either side. The flexion of the foot with respect to the leg, or of the leg with respect to the foot, is accom- plished by two muscles. Tibio-super-Tarseus, or Tibialis Anticus, This muscle arises from the fore-part of the ti- bia, and from the interosseous ligament, and its tendon passes below the annular ligament over the astragalus and os naviculare, and is fixed into the os cuneiforme internum and metatarsal bone of the great toe. Tibio-sub-Tarseus, or Tibialis Posticus. This muscle takes its origin from the posterior surface of the tibia, fibula, and interosseous liga- ment ; and its fibres are disposed obliquely in respect to a middle tendon, which passes behind the inner

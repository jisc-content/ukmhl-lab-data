OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 170 Diseases of the ligaments of the superior ex- tremities are more frequent than those of the in- ferion 1st, They are torn in cases of luxation. 9,d, They are frequently inflamed, and then be- come exquisitely sensible, and in consequence of the inflammation, are much thickened, and some- times suppurate, and the pus works its way out- wardly. # 3d, By gout and rheumatism, they acquire ah unnatural thickness, and are rendered rigid. 4th, Cartilaginous bodies sometimes grow from the ligaments and biirscE mucosae *. 5th, Tophi are sometimes formed between the layers, or on the outer side of the ligaments. 6th, An unusual relaxation and elongation, sometimes, though rarely, takes place in the cap- sular ligaments of the joints of the hips or hume- rus, and hence the head of the humerus, or of the thigh-bone, which generally in such cases shrinks, and is altered in its shape, falls out of its socket. 7th, The ligaments, by scrofula, are reduced to a thickened and spongy state, or to what Dr Rei- MARUs has properly called fungus articnloruiru It may be proper to add, that the articular carti- lages are softened, and afterwards loosened, by this disease, from the bones, and a quantity of ill-con- ditioned pus is contained within the joint; and at length the bones are rendered carious. â€¢ Dr Monro 2d on Burs$ Mucosoe, 1788, p. 32. tab. ix

The acetabulum is lined by a cartilage, which is thinner in its centre than its circumference, and the ball of the thigh-bone is also covered by car- tilage, which is thinner in its circumference than its centre. The capsular ligament of this joint is very strong, especially at the anterior and outer part, but internally it is considerably thinner where it is covered by the iliacus internus muscle. There are several tendinous slips from the ad- jacent muscles, which add considerably to ^the strength of this capsular ligament. This ligament is fixed to the outer side of the brim of the acetabulum, and incloses not only,the head, but also the whole of the neck of the thigh- bone, and the outer part of this ligament extends farther down than the inner, which is reflected upon the neck of the bone *. There is a ligament within this joint somewhat of a triangular shape, which consists of two parts ; one of these is fixed to the under part of the ace- tabulum, and is connected to the substance, called the gland of the joint, from which it becomes gra- • Vid.

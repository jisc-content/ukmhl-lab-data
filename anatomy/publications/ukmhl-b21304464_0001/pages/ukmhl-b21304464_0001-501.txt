LIGAMENTS OF SUPERIOR EXTREMITIES. 473* groove in the os humeri situated between its tu- bercles, by a ligamentous sheath. Back View. The proper posterior ligament is stretched across the semilunar notch of the scapula, and forms that notch into an aperture for the superior and posterior bloodvessels and nerves of the scapula. Sometimes this ligament is double. Anatomists have supposed that this hole is co- vered by ligament, in order to prevent the vessels which pass through it, being injured by friction during the movements of the scapula. There is a ligament, somewhat of a conicalfigure, and hence called conoid, which is in part connec- ted with the last-named ligament, and with the coracoid process of the scapula, and which is fix- ed near to the junction of the clavicle with the scapula. Upon cutting into the capsular ligament of the shoulder-joint, it is found to be of unequal thick- ness ; and at the upper and outer side of the neck of the os humeri, the^ synovial apparatus may be seen. ^ Sect. II. LIGAMENTS OF THE ELBOW-JOINT. The capsular ligament at the elbow-joint is much less extensive, than that at the shoulder-

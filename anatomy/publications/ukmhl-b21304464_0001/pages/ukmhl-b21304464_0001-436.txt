408 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. stices of the bundles of fibres of which the subsca- pularis Tuuscle is composed The spine f rises small at the base of the sca- pula, and becomes higher and broader as it advan- ces forwards. On the sides it is unequally hol- lowed and crooked, by the actions of the adjacent muscles. Its ridge | is divided into two rough flat surfaces: Into the upper one, the trapezius muscle is inserted ; and the lower one has part of the deltoid fixed to it. The end of the spine, called acromioHy or top of the shoulder, is broad and flat, and is sometimes only joined to the spine by a cartilage^. The anterior edge of the acro- mion is flat, smooth, and covered with a cartilage, for its articulation with the external end of the clavicle; and it is hollowed below, to allow a pas- sage to the infra and supra spinati muscles, and free motion to the os humeri. The coracoid process is crooked, with its point inclining forwards ; so that a hollow is left at the lower side of its root, for the passage of the infra- scapularis muscle. The end of this process is marked with three plain surfaces. Into the in- ternal, the serratus minoi anticus is inserted; From the external, one head of the biceps flexor cubiti * Winslow, in Memoires de I’Acad. des Sciences, 17-2. t eminentia scapularym. f Pterigium, crista. § Sue, Trad. d’Osteol. p. l60..

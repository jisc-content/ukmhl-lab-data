OUTLINES OF ANATOMT. â€¢ Vid. Flat# 9* 14<8 Gangrene of Bone. By gangrene, a bone becomes of an opaque Tvhite colour, brown, or black. . The gangrene is frequently limited to the outer tables of the bones, which are cast off by what has been named the process of eifoliation, but in other instances, it extends through the greater part of the bone, and then also is cast off, and the place of the dead bone is in many cases supplied by a new growth of bone around the dead part. The dead portion of bone, or sequestra, as it has been called, is for a time included in the new formed bone. At length it protrudes, forming generally an acute angle with the new formed bone. In time, the dead portion of bone gradually becomes looser, in consequence of being in part absorbed, and at length it falls out, either as an entire cy- linder, or in the form of a number of sharp spi- culae *. In the young, the old bone is sometimes absorbed, and no' part is discharged externally. The new bony case sometimes so completely fills up the space of the dead bone, that although the tibia be the seat of the disease, many patients have been able to walk during the whole progress of the disease. But in some cases, the deposition of the new bone does not keep pace with the destruction of the hriginal bone, and such patients lose the use of the affected member.

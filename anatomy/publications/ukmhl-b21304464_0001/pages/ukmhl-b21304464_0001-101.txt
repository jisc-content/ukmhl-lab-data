CARTILAGE. 73 height during the day, which he regains when in bed, upon the pressure of the superincumbent parts being removed. On the same principle the stoop of old age may be explained. On account of weakness of the muscles of the back, old people bend forwards, by which the fore-parts of the intervertebral car- tilages, which are much compressed, become on account of that pressure much thinner. The cartilages connecting the ribs to the breast- bone may be enumerated among this class of car- tilages. These cartilages may be resolved, by long ma- ceration, into layers, of an oval figure, which are conjoined by a number of cross layers. V The cartilages which unite the ribs to the breast- bone, are powerful agents in expiration ; being twisted during the elevation of the ribs, their elas- tic re-action tends to pull down the ribs. Of the substa?ice, like Cartilage, in which Bone is formed. This substance, Avithin which bone is formed, is composed of transverse and longitudinal fibres. These cartilages are of essential use; thus the body of the foetus is more readily adapted to the form of the uterus of the mother ; thus the sockets of the bones, which are cartilaginous, increase in pro- portion as the heads of the included bones, as in the hip-joint; hence there is less risk of dislocation.

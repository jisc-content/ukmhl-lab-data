213 OT THE SPINE. Canal.—The canal between the bodies and pro- cesses of this bone, for the cauda equina, is trian- gular ; and becomes smaller as it descends, as the cauda also does. Below the third bone, this pas- sage is no more a complete bony canal, but is open behind; and is there defended only by a strong ligamentous membrane stretched over it, which, with the muscles that cover it, and are very prominent on each side, is a sufficient defence for the bundle of nerves within. Foramina.—At the root of each oblique process of this bone, the notch is conspicuous, by which, and such another in the last vertebra of the loins, a passage is left for the twenty-Jourtk spinal ncr'cc ; and, in viewing the os sacrum, either before or behind, four large holes appear in each side, in much the same height, as where the marks of the union of its several bones remain. Some of the largest nerves of the body pass through the anterior boles; and superficial grooves running outwards from them in different directions, shew the course of these nerves. From the intervals of these grooves, the pyri- formis muscle chiefly rises. The holes in the back- part of the bone are covered by membranes which allow small nerves to pass through them. The two uppermost of these holes, especially on the fore-side, are the largest; and as the bone de- scends, the holes turn smaller. Sometimes a notch O 3 * Vexheyen, Anat. tract. 5. cap. 9.

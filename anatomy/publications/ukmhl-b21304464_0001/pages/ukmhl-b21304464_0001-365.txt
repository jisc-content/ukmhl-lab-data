The palate bones form part of the palate, nos- trils, orbits, and fossae pterygoideae, and they cover' part of the sinus maxillares, sphenoidales, and cthmoidei. These bones are very complete in a new-born infant, the nasal plates being then thicker and stronger than in adults; but the orbitar processes have not the cells which appear in the bones of adults. When we are acquainted with the history of these boneSj the reason is evident, why the eyes are so much affected in ulcers of the palate, as to be often attended with blindness, which frequent- ly happens in an ill-managed lues xienerea ; or why, on the other hand, the palate suffers from an (Xgylops*.

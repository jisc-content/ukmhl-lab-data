60 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. “ When the callus has been completed, the parts are put together, as nature joins the broken pieces of the branch of a tree. “ The bark, a tough substance, does not readily yield, and on tying up the broken branch of the tree, there is very little growth between the woody parts, and the fracture is healed by a ringlet of wood from the bark. Our bones are re-united in the same manner, and the new addition is not confined to the broken place, but if the accident is produced by great violence, there is an addition made to the tables from end to end. “We might suppose this owing to irritation on the vessels of the bone, but it is owing in a great measure to the new addition, and we find cells containing marrow interposed; and when we inject the vessels of the callus, which are nume- rous and large, we can trace them from the ex- ternal periosteum. “ I do not affirm that no vessels go in from the ends of the bones ; but they are few, compared with those from without. “ Nay, we find vessels running from the callus to the marrow ; and though we inflame the mar- row, its vessels do not possess the power of gene- rating bone, but rather form a substance like the marrow. “ Next, upon taking out a part of any bone, as of the cranium, we do not find the hole filled up from the sides.

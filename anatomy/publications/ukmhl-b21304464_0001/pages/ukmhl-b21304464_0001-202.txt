OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 174 CIJAFfER Xir. GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORGANIC DISEASES OF THE MUSCLES. TPhe Muscles are frequently inflamed, as, in rheumatism, and this inflammation does not ter- minate in suppuration, but in debility, rigidity, and the effusion of a gelatinous matter into the sheaths of the tendons, and their bursae mucosae. This inflammation is very apt to change its place, and also to become chronic. Pus has sometimes been effused between the fasciculi of muscles. Muscles are sometimes lacerated partially, or wholly, in consequence of violent exertions; as those of the lower extremities, by making a false step, or in dancing. Sometimes the muscles are extremely tender, Muscles have been occasionally displaced. ' Muscles frequently become paralytic, or are spasmodically contracted.

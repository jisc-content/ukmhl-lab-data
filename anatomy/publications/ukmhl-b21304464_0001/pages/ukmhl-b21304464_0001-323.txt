295 OF THE OS OCCIPITIS. tebrae of the neck, and obtains a long lever to act with. On the inner surface of the os occipitis we see two ridges ; one standing perpendicular, the other running horixontally across the first. The upper part of the perpendicular limb of the cross, to which the falx is fixed, is hollowed in the middle, or often on one side, for the reception of the su- perior longitudinal sinus, and the lower part of it has the small or third process of the dura mater fastened to it, and is sometimes hollowed by the occipital sinus. Each side of the horizontal limb is made hollow by the lateral sinuses inclosed in the transverse process of the dura mater; the fossa in the right side being generally a continua- tion of the one made by the longitudinal sinus in the perpendicular limb, and therefore is larger than the left one *. Round the middle of the cross there are four large depressions separated by its limbs; the two upper ones being formed'by the back-part of the brain, and the two lower ones by the cerebellum. Farther forward than the last-mentioned de- pressions, is the lower part of the fossa for the la- teral sinus on each side. The inner surface of the cuneiform apophyse is made concave for the reception of the medulla oblongata, and of the basilar artery. A furrow is made on each side, near the edges of this process, by a sinus of the Morgagn. Advers. Anat. 6. Animad. l. T4

The heart, arteries, and intestines, afford e^t- amples of this description ; and it is remarkable, that such muscles are not fatigued by continued action^ It may not be improper to addj that some of the muscles which are 7iot in man obedient to the will, are so in animals; thus, in ruminating animals, the stomach is a voluntary muscle ; anxl farther, even in the human body, those muscles which are involuntary are, in consequence of violent passions of the mind, sometimes excited, as palpitation of the heart, by anger or fCar. The nerves which lead to the voluntary muscles are much larger than those proper to the involun- tary muscles ; yet the irritability of the latter class is more durable, and more readily excited than that of the former class. The irritability, there- fore, of a muscle, is by no means proportioned to the size of the nerves. There is a third, and intermediate class of muscles, which has been named mixed, as we can at pleasure increase or modify their action, but can- not stop it altogether, or for a great length of time. The diaphragm, and muscles of respiration, are included in this class. Of the action of this third class of muscles we are not sensible, unless the attention of the mind be directed to it. When such muscles act in an

294 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. of the muscles on this bone are very strong and plain in some subjects, but are not so distinct in others. All round the great foramen the edges are un- equal, for the firmer adhesion of the strong cir- cular ligament which goes thence to the first ver- tebra. One end of each lateral or moderator ligament of the head, is fixed to a rough surface at the fore- part of each condyle, and the perpendicular one is connected to a rough part of the edge of the great hole between the two condyles. Immediately before the condyles, two little de- pressions are made in the external suface of the cuneiform process, for the insertion of the recti anteriores minores muscles, which are unjustly as- cribed to CowpER; And still further forward, nearer the sphenoid bone, are two other such de- pressions, for the reception of the recti anteriores majores. The muscles which pull the head back- wards, are stronger than those are which bend it forwards ; and acquire greater force by the long lever they act with, than the latter which are in- serted so near the condyles. This great force in the extensor muscles is altogether necessary, that they might not only keep the head from falling forward in an erect posture, but that they might support it when we bow forward in the most ne- cessary offices of social life, when the weight of the head comes to act at right angles on the ver-

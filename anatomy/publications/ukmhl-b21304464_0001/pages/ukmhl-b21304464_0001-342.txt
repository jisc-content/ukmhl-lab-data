This hole is not formed only by the os sphenoides, which has an aperture near as large as any trans- verse section of the sinus, but also by the palate bones which are applied to the fore-part of these sinuses, and close them up, that hole only except- ed, which was already mentioned. Frequently the two sinuses are of unequal dimensions, and sometimes there is only one large cavity, with an opening into one nostril. These cavities are like- wise said * to be extended sometimes as far back as the great foramen of the occipital bone. In other subjects they are not to be found, when the bone is composed of large cells f. Some men- tion a cavity within the partition of the sinuses ; but it is small. The sphenoidal sinuses serve the same uses as the frontal do. As this bone is extremely ragged and unequal, so its substance is of very different thickness, being in some places diaphanous *, in others it is of a middle thickness, and its middle back-part sur- passes the greatest share of the cranium in thick- ness. The os sphenoides is joined by its wings, to the parietal bones above, to the os frontis and ossa malarum before, to the temporal bones behind j * Albin. de Ossib. § t Vesal. lib. 1. cap. 6. J Id.

Under this bridge or jugum, the twenty-ninâ€™-h pair of spinal nerves runs in its course to the common holes just now described. The upper part of the body of the first bone re- sembles ttie vertebrae oj the loins; but the small fifth bone is oblong transversely, and hollow in the middle of its lower surface. The substance oj the os sacrum is very spongy, without any considerable soiid external plates, and is lighter proportionally to its bulk than any other bone in the body ; but is secured from injuries by the thick muscles that cover it behind, and by the strong ligamentous membranes. As this is one of the most remarkable instances of this sort of de- fence afforded a soft weak bone, we may make the general observation, that wherever we meet with such a bone,,one or other, or both these defences are made use of; the first to ward of injuries, and the second to keep the substance of the bone from yielding too easily. This bone is articulated above to the last verte- bra the loinSf in the manner that the lumbar ver-

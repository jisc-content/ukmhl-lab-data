Cartilage may be distinguished from other animal substances, by its grey pearly or opal-like colour,—by the remarkable smoothness of its sur- face,—by its elasticity,—by its semi-pellucidity, and by being much lighter than bone. The cartilages, when macerated for some time in water, exhibit a fibrous structure. Cartilage forms a considerable share of those organs where it is necessary to combine fiexibility with a certain degree of firmness, in order that the part may always preserve a certain form. Cartilages are covered by a membrane called Perichondrium, which is somewhat similar in its office to the periosteum ; serving 'to conduct the small vessels which enter into the substance of the cartilages.

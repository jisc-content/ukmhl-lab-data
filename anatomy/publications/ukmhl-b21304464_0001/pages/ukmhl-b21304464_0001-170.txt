outlines of ANATOMr. 142 The scrofulous exostoses, which sometimes at- tain a large size, are most frequent in the bones of the spine, of the tarsus, carpus, and in the bones forming the hip and knee joints ; whereas the ve- nereal exostoses appear mostâ€™ frequently in the middle and most compact part of the tibia, humerus^ ulna, or in the os frontis, and ossa parietalia. Exostoses generally grow outwardly, but some- times, though much more rarely, inwardly, so as to press much upon the brain, the viscera of the thorax or pelvis. The structure of exostoses is evidently different from that of the original bone *. Some exostoses, when divided, are found to be made up of a thin outer plate of bone, to which thin osseous plates are connected, which pass a- cross the tumor, and the interstices between these are filled up by cartilage ; and in others, beside a gristly substance, there are fungous granulations, and a quantity of ill-conditioned pus. Such ex- ostoses often attain a large bulk, and are very irregular in figure. Vid. Elate 6. Some exostoses are made up of a number of small fibres, ^hich, as to their disposition, are not unlike those in the roots of some trees in a state of decay. Ocher exostoses consist of solid bone, which is as dense as ivory, and these are generally of a small size, of a round, or oval shape, and very hard tc the touch. * Vid. Plate 6. I

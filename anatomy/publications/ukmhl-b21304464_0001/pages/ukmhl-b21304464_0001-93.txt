OSTEOLOGY. 65 which again we can understand one reason, why the bones of young animals sooner reunite af- ter a fracture than those of old, and why cattle that are put too soon to hard labour, are seldom of such large size as others of the same brood which are longer kept from labour.” But the above theory of my Grandfather, Baron Haller, and others, is inadequate to the explanation of the process of ossification, which, in many cases, takes place where pressure cannot exert its influence. Bony matter is secreted from the blood, like the bile or urine, and formed into its proper consistence by the action of the circu- lating and absorbent vessels, and independently of. pressure, which cannot be admitted to be the prin- cipal cause of ossification. Pressure, after the bones have been formed, may perhaps have some effect in condensing them. Climate may also accelerate the process of ossi- fication. Whence, in hot countries, the inhabi- tants sooner come to their height of stature than in the northerly cold regions. Authors 071 the Bones of the Adult. Vksalius, De Corporis Humani fabrica.

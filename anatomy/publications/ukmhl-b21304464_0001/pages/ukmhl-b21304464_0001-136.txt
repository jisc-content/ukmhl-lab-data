108 OUTLINES OF ANATOMT. five equal parts, and these laid obliquely in such a manner as that their fibres form the diagonals of triangles, of which the height measures four inches and the basis three inches. If there w'as no loss of,strength by their pulling obliquely, the five short muscles would raise five times the weight; but in fact one-fifth of the force is lost by their obliquity. Borellus, De Motu Muscu- lorum, p. 92., proves. That the â€œ potentia oblique trahens est ad resistentiam ut longitudo directionis oblique ad ejus sublimitatem.V But after this de- duction, the five oblique muscles could raise four times as much as the single straight one of the same breadth and thickness. 3. We find in reality muscles which correspond very nearly wdth the above supposed structure. Thus, let us compare with each other two muscles, the figures of which are copied from the very ac- curate work of Albinus, in Plate 2. fig. 1. and 2. Fig. 1. represents the sartorius muscle in which the fibres, which are of great length, are straight, and nearly parallel to each other. In the second figure, which represents the peroneus longus, which is nearly as long as the sartorius, the fibres are laid obliquely and semipenniform, and do not measure above a fifth part of the whole length of the muscle, from its uppermost to its undermost bundle of fibres; and when we attend to the de- gree of the obliquity of the muscular fibres, ap4

OBLIQUE MUSCLES. il5 CL is longer in proportion to BL, than BL is in proportion to iVL. Or, the same thing is made manifest in a more simple manner, by comparing together the tri- angles ABL, BCL, and CDL, in fig. 6., in which it is evident, that the line AL subtending the largest angle bears a greater proportion to BL, than BL does to CL. Hence, as the degree of obliquity of an oblique muscle is gradually increasing during its action, its force is diminishing, whilst its effect of pro- ducing extensive motion is increasing. 8. Having demonstrated geometrically the general proposition, I shall now illustrate it by applying arithmetical calculation. Thus, (See Plate 3. fig. 7-), if we suppose two straight muscles, such as our recti abdominis, ABCDEF to be five inches long, and to shorten themselves, in contracting, one-fifth part of their length, they will draw the point A, which we shall call the ensiform cartilage, down to the let- ter B, or they will move it through a space of one inch only; but if wâ€™e suppose the same muscles to be placed obliquely, and their origins fixed to the ossa ilia instead of the ossa pubis, and that a line drawn transversely between the ossa ilia measures eight inches, it is evident that they would draw the point A, or ensiform cartilage, three times farther, because they will not lose one-fifth of H2 .

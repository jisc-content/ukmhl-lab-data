112 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 5. To discover these, let us now compare, more exactly, with each other, the effects of straight and oblique muscles; and, in the Jirst place, let us suppose them to be situated between two paral- lel lines, (See Plate 3. fig. 3.) Let AHH and KDE represent two parallel lines. Let ABCD represent a pair of straight muscles, and AFGE and AK a pair of oblique ones. . Let us next irhagine, that each of these pairs of' muscles can in action shorten itself one-third part of its length. On this supposition, the straight muscles will be able to bring the point A, which is supposed to be moveable, down to B, and will then have lost one-third of their length. But when the pair of oblique muscles had by their action brought the point A down to B, they have not lost one-third of their length, as it is evi- dent that the line BE, which subtends an obtuse angle, is longer thail FE, which is equal in length to two-thirds of the oblique muscle. Hence it appears, that a pair of oblique muscles placed between the same parallels with a pair of straight muscles, can, with less proportional de- curtation, produce the same extent of motion that the straight mukles can do. We may next prove that the oblique muscle has not lost so much of its length as is equal to one-third of the length of the straight muscle. For if we form an isosceles triangle ABL, (see PI. 3. fig. 4.), as the two sides AB and BK of the triangle ABK

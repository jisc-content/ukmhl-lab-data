SUTURIS or THE SKULL. 265 Tho iranvotrse suture is extended quite cross the face, from the external canthus of one orbit to the same place of the other, by sinking from the canthus down the outside of the orbit to its bottom ; then mounting upon its inside, it is continued by the root of the nose down the inter- nal part of the other orbit, and rises up again on its outside to the other canthus. It may be here remarked, that there are some interruptions of this suture in the course I have described ; for the bones are not contiguous every where, but are se- parated, to leave holes and apertures, to be men- tioned hereafter. - The zygomatic sutures are one on each side, being short, and slanting from above obliquely downwards and backwards, to join a process of the cheek bone to one of the temporal banes, which advances towards the face; so that the two processes thus united, form a sort of bridge, or jugum, under which the temporal muscle passes ; on which account the processes, and suture joining them, have been called zygomatic. It must be observed, that the indentations of the sutures are not so distinct on the inside of the cranium, as on the outside ; the bones seem- ing almost joined in a straight line ; nay in some skulls, the internal surface is found entire, while the sutures are manifest without; which may possibly be owing to the less extent of the con- cave than of the convex surface of the cranium,

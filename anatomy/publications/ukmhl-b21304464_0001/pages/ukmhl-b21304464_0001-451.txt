OF THE RADIUS. 423 Of the Radius. The Radius *, so called from its imagined re- semblance to a spoke of a wheel, is the bone pla- ced at the inside of the fore-arm. Its upper end is formed into a circular little head, which is hollowed for its articulation with the tubercle at the side of the pully of the os humeri ; and the half of the round circumference of the head next to the ulna is smooth, and covered with a cartilage, in order to be received into the semi- lunated cavity of that bone. Below the head, the radius is much smaller; therefore this part is named its cerviv, which is made round by the action of the supinator mdii brevis. At the external root of this neck, a tuberous process rises j into the outer part of which the bi- ceps flexor cubiti is inserted. From this, a ridge runs downwards and inwards, where the supina- tor radii brevis is inserted ; and a little belowâ€™, and behind this ridge, there is a rough scabrous sur- face, w'here the pronator radii teres is fi%ed. The body of the radius is not straight, but con- vex on its internal gnd posterior surfaces; where it is also made round by the equal pressure of the circumjacent muscles, particularly of the exten- sors of the thumb ; but the surfaces next to the ulna are flatted and rough, for the origins of the * focile minus, canna minor, aiimdo minor, D d 4

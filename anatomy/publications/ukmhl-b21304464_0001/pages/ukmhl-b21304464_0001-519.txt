491 OF THE FIBULA. ject, is covered with a cartilage, but so closely con- nected to the tibia by ligaments, as to allow only a small motion backwards and forwards. This head is protuberant and rough on its outside, where a strong round ligament and the musculus biceps are inserted ; and, below the back-part of its internal side, a tubercle may be remarked, that gives rise to the strong tendinous part of the solaeus muscle. The body of this bone is a little crooked inwards and backwards. The sharpest angle of the fibula is forwards ; on each side of which, the bone is considerably,â€™ but unequally depressed by the bellies of the se- veral muscles that rise from, or act upon it; and, in old people, these muscles make distinct sinuosi- ties for themselves. The external surface of the fibula is depressed obliquely from above downwards and backwards, by the two peronasi. Its internal surface is unequally divided into two narrow longitudinal planes, by an oblique ridge extended from the upper part of the anterior angle, to join with the lower end of the internal angle. To this ridge the ligament stretched be- tween the two bones of the leg is connected. The anterior of the two planes is very narrow above, where the extensor longus digitorum and extensor longus pollicis arise from it; but is broad- er below, where it has the print of the nonus Ve-

OBLIQUE MUSCLES.. 10A' Of the Varied Direction of the Fibres of our Muscles, and of the Effect of this upon our Motions. 1. In many of our muscles, the fleshy fibres, in- stead of running in straight lines, or in lines near- ly such, between their origins and insertions, are placed in oblique directions. Before I attempt to explairi the effects of the direction of the,fleshy fibres, I shall describe the varieties of this in the different muscles of the hu- man body. 1. In some muscles, as in the recti of the abdo- men, the sartorius, the gracilis, &c. the fibres are directed, from the origins of the muscles to their insertions, in nearly parallel lines ; and these may be called straight muscles; (see Plate 2. fig. 1. of this Treatise.) 2. In others, the muscle is of a triangular shape, and its fibres resemble the spokes of a wheel, or the sticks of a spread fan ; and such muscles may be called radiated. The fibres in some of them diverge from the origin or fixed point, as is the case in the levator palpebrae superioris ; and in others, as in the temporal, subscapularis, or great pectoral, they converge from their origins toward^ ^heir insertions.

OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 428 ed back very little farther than to a straight line with the fore-arm, but can be considerably bend- ed forwards. The hand has commonly been divided into the carpus, metacarpus, and fingers ; among which last the thumb is reckoned. The Carpus* is composed of eight small spongy bones, situated at the upper part of the hand. I shall describe each of these bones, under a proper name taken from their figure f. I shall begin with the range of bones that are concerned in the moveable joint of the wrist, or are connect- ed to the fore-arm, and shall afterwards consider the four that support the thumb and ossa metacarpi of the fingers. The eight bones of the carpus are, os scaphoides, lunare,cuneiforme, pisijorme, trapezium, trapezoides, magnum, unc'forme. The scaphoides is situated most internally of those that are articulated with the fore-arm. The lunare is immediately on the outside of the former. The cuneiforme is placed still more externally, but does not reach so high up as the other two. The pisiforme stands forwards into the palm from the cuneiforme. The trapezium is the first of the second row, and is situated betwixt the' scaphoides and first joint of the thumb. Â« * Kth?, brachiale, prima palmae pars, rasetta, 'j Lyscr. Cult.

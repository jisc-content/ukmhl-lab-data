OF THE SPlNFl. 185 True Vertebrce. The true vertebrae * are the twenty-four up- per bones of the spine, on which the several mo- tions of the trunk of our bodies are performed j from which use they have justly got their name. Each of these vertebrce is composed of its body and processes. The body is the thick spongy fore-part, which is convex before, concave backwards, horizon- tal and plain in most of them above and be- low. Numerous small holes, especially on the fore and back part of their surface, give passage to their vessels, and allow the ligaments to enter their substance. The edges of the body of each ^vertebra are covered, especially at the fore-part, with a ring of bone firmer and more solid than the substance of the body any where else. These rings seem to be joined to the xiertebrce in the form of epiphyses. ' They are of great use in preventing the spongy 1 bodies from being broken in the motions of the I trunk.

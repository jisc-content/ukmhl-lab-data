68 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. Chemical Analysis of Cartilage. As no experiments seem to have been perform- ed upon human cartilages, I requested Mr John Davy to examine it. “ In compliance with your request, 1 liavc made a few experiments on human cartilage ; the follow- ing results of which, are such as might have been expected, and arc agreeable to the conclusion ge- nerally drawn from Mr Hatchett’s interesting researches, that cartilage is principally condensed albumen. “ That which I have examined, and which anatomists call obducent cartilage, was apparently free from bone, and quite pure. “ A quantity of it was boiled in water in a glass vessel for about an hour. The water was thus rendered cloudy in a slight degree. Infusion of nut-galls added to it produced a small precipitate ; solution of corrosive sublimate had a similar ef- fect ; but acetite of lead occasioned a much more copious one. The cartilage was washed with fresh cold water, and again boiled for about three hours. The precipitate now produced by infusion of nut- galls and corrosive sublimate in the water, was considerably less than in the first instance ; and the effect of the acetite of lead was still more di- minished. “ The cold sulphuric and muriatic acids acted on it very slowly ; the former, after twenty-four

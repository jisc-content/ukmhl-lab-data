OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 548 about the external condyle of the thigh-bone, to the head of the fibula, and is covered by the ten- don of the biceps ; and behind this, there is a shorter and thinner ligament similarly situated. There is also an internal ligament of consider- able breadth, passing between the internal con- dyle of the thigh-bone, which, becoming broader as it descends, is inserted into the edge of the in- ternal semilunar cartilage, and into the upper and inner part of the head of the tibia; and it is co- vered at its insertion by the tendons of the gracilis, semitendinosus, and sartorius muscles. In the back part of the capsular ligament, there are irregular bands of ligamentous fibres, which extend between the condyles of the thigh-bone, and the upper and inner part of the head of the tibia ; a few of these fibres, which descend ob- liquely from the external condyle of the thigh- bone to the tibia, are stronger than the others, and have been said to form the ligamentum posticum of Winslow. There is a ligament connecting the patella to the tuberosity at the upper and fore-part of the tibia; and, in some subjects, there is a strong transverse ligament, which fixes the head of the tibia to that of the fibula. Upon opening the knee-joint, we meet with li- gaments within the joint. The capsular ligament is reflected, and forms the lateral ligaments, called alai'ia externa, and

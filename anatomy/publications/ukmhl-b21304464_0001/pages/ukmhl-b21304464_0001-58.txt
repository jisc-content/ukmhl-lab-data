30 OUTLINES or ANATOMY. Since, therefore, the strength of bones depends on their number of fibres, or quantity of matter^ and the largeness of their diameters, one may con- clude, that the part of a bone formerly fractured, and reunited by a callus, must be stronger than it was before the fracture happened ; because both these advantages are obtained by a callus ; which is a wise provision, since bones are never set in such a good direction as they were naturally of. This callus may indeed, for want of compres- sion, be allowed to form into a spongy cellular substance ; but even in this case, the strength of the bone is here increased by one or both the causes above mentioned. It may not be improper to add, that although the hollowness of a bone enables it to resist better such forces as are applied to break it transverse- ly, because the corresponding fibres arc at a greater distance from the immoveable centre on which they turn, and therefore resist more, from their gaining the advantage of a longer lever; yet we are to observe, that where a bone is pres- sed in, as by the wheel of a cart, or beat in by the stroke of a stone, or of a bullet, its resistance is lessened by its hollowness, because the impelling force acts with the advantage of a longer lever. Thus, a small glass phial is perhaps strong enough to support a manâ€™s weight, but a larger phial of the same thickness will be broken by it. Hence also, if two skulls be of the same thickness, but

Oj the Connecting Cartilages. Contiguous bones, as the ossa innominata and sacrum, the ossa pubis, the sternum, ribs and ver- tebrae, are united by cartilages. The Intervertebral Cartilages are of a very peculiar kind ; being composed of an inter- mixture of cartilage and ligament, they partake of the properties of both ; thus the very oppo- site properties, elasticity, flexibility and firmness, are combined*. In the centre of these intervertebral cartilages, there is a glutinous substance, which is the centre of motion. These cartilages impart a great degree of elas- ticity to the spine, and have a very great effect in facilitating its movements ; for the bones work up- on the intermediate cartilages. These cartilages are very compressible ; and hence a tall young man loses sensibly of his * For a more particular account of these, see article Spine.

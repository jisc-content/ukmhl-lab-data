DISEASES or BONES. 151 Rickets, mollities ossium, and osteosarcoma, have been commonly considered as different diseases, whereas it is probable that they are only degrees of the same morbid derangement; and these diffe- rent names should be retained, to express the degree of softening of the bone, and the period of life at which it has taken place. Thus, rickets is a disease of infancy \ mollities, of advanced life ; and in the latter, the softness of the bones is much greater than in the former. In some cases, only one of the bones, but in other instances, the greater number of bones of the skeleton are affected. In early life, I have seen the disease limited to the spine, to the breast-hone, or to the ribs, occa- sioning a manifest depression in these. The rickety skeleton presents the following ap- pearances. The bones are crooked, and in many cases flat- tened, and considerably broader than in the sound state. The skull is generally unnaturally large, owing either to the preternatural extension of the diploe, (Vid. Plate 12.), or to the disunion of the bones of the skull, in consequence of water accumulated within the ventricles of the brain. The thorax is sharper before, and more depress- ed at its sides. The cartilages of the ribs, instead of being convex outwardly, become concave, and on many Â©epasjons, there are hard osseous tumors at the K4

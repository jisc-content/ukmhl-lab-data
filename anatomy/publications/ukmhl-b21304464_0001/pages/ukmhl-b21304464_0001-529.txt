OF THE FOOT.- 501 • • - To avoid repetition, in describing the bones, I desire, once for all, to observe, that wherever a ridge is mentioned, without a particular use as- signed, a ligament is understood to be fixed to it; or where a spongy rough^cavity, depression or fos- sa is remarked, without naming its use, a ligament is inserted. Of the Astragalus. . The upper part of the Astragalus * is formed into a large smooth head f, which is slightly hollow- ed in the middle ; and therefore resembles a su- perficial pulley, by which it is fitted to the lower end of the tibia. The internal side of this head is flat and smooth, to play on the internal malleolus. The external side has also such a surface, but larger, for its ar- ticulation with the external malleolus. ^ Round the base of this head there is a rough fossa ; and, immediately before the head, as also below its in- ternal smooth surface, we find a considerable rough cavity. The lower surface of the astragalus is divided by an irregular deep rough fossa •, which at its in- ternal end is narrow, but gradually widens, as it stretches obliquely outwards and forwards.

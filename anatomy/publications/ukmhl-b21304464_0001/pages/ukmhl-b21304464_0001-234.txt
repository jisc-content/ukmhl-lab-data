^06 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. contribute to restrain these vertebrae from, much motion, which might disturb the actions of the heart and lungs ; and, in consequence of the little motion allowed here, the intervertebral cartilages sooner shrivel, by becoming more solid: And, therefore, the first remarkable curvature of the spine observed, as people advance to old age, is in the least stretched vertebrae of the back; or old people first become round-shouldered. The bodies of the four uppermost dorsal verte- br(Ey deviate from the rule of the vertebrae be- coming larger as they descend; for the first of the four is the largest, and the other three below gradually become smaller, to allow the trachea and large vessels to divide at smaller angles. The two uppermost vertebrae of the back, in- stead of being very prominent forwards are flat- ted by the action of the musculi longi colli and recti majores. The proportional size of the two little depres- sions in the body of each vertebra for receiving the heads of the ribs, seems to vary in the follow- ing manner ; The depression on the upper edge of each vertebra decreases as far down as the fourth, and after that increases. The transverse processes are longer in each lower vertebra to the seventh or eighth, with their smooth surfaces, for the tubercles of the ribs, fa- cing gradually more downwards *, but afterwards as they descend they become shorter, and the smooth surfaces are directed more upwards.

DISEASES' OF THE BONES* 163 Luxations are frequent where a joint admits of free motion, and in different directions. Thus the motions at the shoulder-joints are more free than those of other joints ; and hence that joint is more frequently dislocated than any other. A dislocation is more rare in the joints like a hinge; for the extent of surface of the articulation is considerable, and the joint admits of flexion and extension only, and the ligaments are short, thick, and numerous. The structure of the joints, points out the di- rection in which the luxation commonli) happens. Thus the humerus may be dislocated upwards, downwards, inwards or outwards, or the ball of the os humeri may pass over any part of the gle- noid cavity. The direction of the luxation is determined also by the position of neighbouring muscles and ten- dons ; hence, as the capsular ligament at the shoul- der, is not so much strengthened at the inner, as at the outer side, luxations inwardly are more fre- quent than in the contrary direction. The hip-joint is most commonly dislocated downwards and inwards, from the deficiency of bone at the inner side of the acetabulum. Luxations are complete, incomplete, or complica- ted zvith contusion orjracture, L2

To the sides of these bones of the os coccygis, the coccygaei muscles *, and part of the levatores ani, and of the glutaei maximi, are fixed. The substance of these bones is very spongy, and in children cartilaginous ; there being only a part of the first bone ossified in a new-born in- fant. Since, therefore, the intestinum rectum of children is not so firmly supported as it is in adults, this may be one reason why they are more subject to a procidentia ani than old, people f.

OF THE OS UNCIFORME. 435 some few cases, where something extraordinary was to be observed ; and I have designedly omit- ted the other rough surfaces, lest, by crowding too many words in the description of such small bones, the whole' should be unintelligible : But these scabrous part of the bones may easily be un- derstood, after mentioning their figure, if it is ob- served, that they are generally found only towards the back or palm of the hand ; that they are all plain, larger behind than before j and that they receive the different ligaments, by which they are either connected to neighbouring bones, or to one another ; for these ligaments cover all the bones, and are so accurately applied to them, that, at first view, the whole carpus of a recent subject appears one smooth bone *. As the surfaces of these bones are larger be- hind, the figure of the whole conjoined must be convex there, and concave before ; which concavi- ty is still more increased by the os pisiforme, and process of the os unciforme, standing forwards on one side, as the trapezium does on the other; And the bones are securely kept in this form, by the broad strong transverse ligament connected to these parts of them that stand prominent into the palm of the hand. The convexity behind renders the whole fabric stronger, where it is most expos- ed to injuries; and the large anterior hollow is E e 2 * Galen de usu part, lib 2. cap. 8.

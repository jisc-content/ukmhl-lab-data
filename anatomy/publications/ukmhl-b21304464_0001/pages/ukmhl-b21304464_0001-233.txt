OF THE SPINE. 205 wards, and the lower ones slanting as much back- wards. They have not so much convexity or con- cavity as is worth remarking. Between the oblique processes of opposite sides, several sharp processes stand out from the upper and lower parts of the plates which join to form the spinal process*, into these sharp processes, strong ligaments are fixed, for connecting the vertebrcC. The transverse processes of the dorsal vertebras are long, thicker at their ends than in the middle, and turned obliquely backwards ; which may be owing to the pressure of the ribs, the tubercles of j which are inserted into a depression near the end of these processes. / The spinal processes are long, small pointed, and sloping downwards and backwards; from their upper and back-part a ridge rises, which is received by a small channel in the fore-part of the spinal process immediately above, which is here connected to it by a ligament. The conduit of the spinal marrow is here more circular, but, corresponding to the size of that cord, is smaller than in any of the other vertebrae, and a larger share of the holes in the bony ridges, for the transmission of the nerves, is formed in the vertebra above, than in the one below. The connection of the dorsal vertehrcB to the ribs, the thinness of their cartilages, the erect si- tuation of the oblique processes, the length, slop- ing, and connection of the spinal processes, all

And as the sinuses of the two sides are frequently of unequal size ; so one of these cavities is as often larger than the other Round the external meatus auditorius, several si- nuosities are formed for receiving the-cartilages and ligaments of the ear, and for their firm ad- hesion. The holes that commonly appear on the outside of each of these bones, and are proper to each of them, are five; Thefirsty situated between the zygomatic and mastoid processes; is the orifice of a large funnel- like canal, which leads to the organ of hearing ; therefore is called meatus auditorius externus f. The second gives passage to the portia dura of the seventh pair of nerves, and, from its situation between the mastoid and styloid processes, is cal- led foramen stylo-mastoideum Some way before, and to the inside of the sty- loid process, is the third hole ; the canal from which runs first upwards, then forwards, and re- ceives into it the internal carotid artery, and the beginning of the intercostal nerve; where this canal is about to make the turn forwards, one, or • Hunauld, in Mem. de I’Acad. dcs Sciences, 1730. ■j" riogos T>j? a»0Ti?, ott'a tv* utu*.

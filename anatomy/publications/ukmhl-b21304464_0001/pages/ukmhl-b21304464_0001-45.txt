17 OSTIOLOGY. On the surfaces of a great many of the bones there are cavities, or depressions; If these are deep, with large brims, authors name them cotylcB If they are superficial, they obtain the designa- tion of glena, or glenoid. These general classes are again divided into several species: Of which pits are small roundish channels, sunk perpendi- cularly into the bone ; Jun'ows are long narrow canals, formed in the surface; niches, or notches, small breaches in the bone; sinuosities, broad, but superficial depressions without brims ; fossa, large deep cavities, which are not equally sur- rounded by high brims ; sinuses, large cavities within the substance of the bones, with small apertures; foramina, or holes, canals that pierce quite through the substance of the bones. When this last sort of cavity is extended any long way within a bone, the middle part retains the name of canal, and its ends are called holes. The eminences and hollows of the bones, which are more strongly marked in the male than in the female, give insertion to the muscles and liga- ments, or form surfaces of articulation. By remov- ing the insertions of the muscles farther from the axis of the bone, they increase their power of mov- ing it. The eminences to which the ligaments are fix- ed, remove the ligament to a greater distance VOL. I. B * Krrj>i{hi, Acetabula, pixldcs, buccellir.

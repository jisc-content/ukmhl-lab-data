OF THE FORM OF THE SKULL.' 355 Dr Blumenbach of Gottingen*, after enu- merating his Objections to the methods which Daubenton, Albert Durer, and Camper have proposed for pointing out the national peculiari- ties of skulls, has proposed the following method, which he thinks less objectionable. He arranges his crania on a table in a row, and contemplates them behind ; thus he observes the breadth and narrowness of the forehead, its arched or flat form, and the direction of the jaw's and cheek- bone ; and this he has called his norma verticalis. But such a view may be said to be partial ; and it does not present to us many of the important differences in the form of the bones of the face, especially the very different form of the orbits, and many other peculiarities in the upper jaw.

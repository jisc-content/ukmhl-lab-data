OF THE OSSA MALARUM. 825 to the maxillary bone, by the internal orbitar suture ; by the side between the maxillary and inferior orbitar process, again to the maxillary bone, by the external orbitar suture ; by. the zygomatic process to the os temporum, by the zygomatic suture. The cheek-bones are entire, and fully ossified in all their parts in infants. Ossa Maxillaria Superiora. The Ossa Maxillaria Superiora* arc the largest bones, and constitute the far greater part of the upper jaw, which has appropriated the name of maxillaria to them. The figure of one of them, or of the two when joined, is so irregular, that words can scarce give an idea of it. The processes of each os maxillare may be reckoned seven. The first is the long nasal one at its upper and fore-part, which is broad below, and turns smaller, as it rises upwards to make the side of the nose. At the root of this, a trans- verse ridge may be observed within the nostrils, which supports the fore-part of the upper edge of the os spongiosum inferius. The second is pro- duced backwards and outwards, from the root of the nasal process, to form the lower side of the orbit; and therefore may be called orbitar. The edge of this orbitar process, and the ridge of the nasal one, which is continued from* it, make a considerable portion of the external circumference

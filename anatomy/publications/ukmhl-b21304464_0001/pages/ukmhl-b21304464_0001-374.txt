OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 34>6 lower jaw, fractures of it may be attended with dangerous symptoms. The surface of the lower jaw is hard and firm, except at the spongy sockets, where however it is stronger than the upper jaw. Its internal sub- stance is cellular, without any solid partition be- tween the cancelli in its middle. At the base, especially of the chin, where this bone is most ex- posed to injuries, the solid sides of it are thick, compact and hard. The lower jaw generally receives the roots of sixteen teeth into its sockets, by gomphosis; and its condyloid processes, covered with cartilage, are articulated with the temporal bones, in a man- ner that is not commonly described with accuracy : For, as was already mentioned in the description of the temporal bones, not only the fore-part of the cavity between the zygomatic, auditory and vaginal processes, but also the adjoining tubercle at the root of the zygomatic process of each os temporum, is covered with a smooth cartilage, for this articulation. Here also an mterinediate 'moveable cartilage is placed, which being thin in the middle, and thick at the edges, is concave on both sides ; and is connected so firmly by liga- ments to each condyle, as to follow the motions of the condyle; and so loosely to. the temporal bone, as readily to change its situation from the cavity to the tubercle, and to return again; while the common ligament of the articulation affords space enough for such a change of place back-

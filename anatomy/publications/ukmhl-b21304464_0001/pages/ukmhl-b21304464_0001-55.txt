OSTEOLOGY. 27 These cancelli differ considerably in figure, num- ber, and size ; and communicate with each other. Some writers * minutely remark these different appearances of the cancelli, after they begin to se- parate from the plates; and from thence distinguish them into wrinkled, perj orated, and net-like. The cancelli sustain the marrow, and prevent it from being injured in violent motions, and in different postures, and from being compressed by the weight of the marrow above. The depressions between the fibres of the external plates of bones appear like so many furrows on their surface, by which the surface of contact, consequently the ad- hesion between it and the bones, is increased, and a greater number of vesssels is sent from it into the bone, than if it were a plain surface. The broad bones have thin sides, by the plates being soon and equally sent off to form the lattice- work ; which therefore is thicker, and nearly of an equal form all through. By this structure, they are well adapted to their uses, of affording a large enough surface for the muscles to rise from, and move upon, and of defending sufficiently the parts which they inclose. The round bones have thick strong walls in the middle, and become very thin towards their ends, which is owing to very few plates separating at their middle ; where, on that account, the cancelli * Gagliard.

OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. *124 But, upon these assertions of Mr Yeates, T would ob- kciwe, in the firsl place, That Dr HalmcujwIu) had read, and quotes Mayow’s works, and who had considered the subject more fully than any other person of the present a^e, and by numerous experiments, chiefly on living ani- mals, which I quoted in the Observations I published on the Muscles, p. IG., ascertained the fact, that the exter- nal and internal intercostal muscles co-operate in inspi- ration, (which I have since found, but did not then know, had been taught by Dr Mayow, otherwise I should have quoted him along with Dr Haller,) did not per- ceive in Mayow, or in his own writings teach, any new principle throwing light on the general effects of oblique muscles, or tending to prove that oblique muscles possess the advantages of performing more extensive motions than straight muscles are capable of doing. • I shall next, as IMr Ybates proposes, allow Dr Mayow to speak for 'himself in the following paragraphs, on which the claim for him rests. In the Editio novissima of his “ Opera omnia IMedico- Physica, 1681, tractatibus quinque comprehensa,” Trac- tatus Secundus, De Respiratione, p. 245., he states his arguments for his opinion, that the intercostal muscles, even the interior ones, serve for enlarging the chest; “ IMusculi intercostales etiam interiores pectori ampli- “ ando inserviuntand in the next page, 24G., he at- tempts to explain the reasons why the intercostal muscles have an oblique position, “ Cur musculi intercostales “ obliquam positionem habent,'” in the following words; “ Et hoc ulterius adhuc ostendit musculorum intercos- talium obliquus, et contrarius situs. Ideo cnim vidctur natura musculos illos oblique costis inseruisse, (quangitam ludem sursum, aui deorsum movendis recta i7iscrliQ mejiuj

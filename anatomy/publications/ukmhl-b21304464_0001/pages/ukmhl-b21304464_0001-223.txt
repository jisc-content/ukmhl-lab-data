195 OF THE SPINE. why the vertebrae advance forward as they de- scend, and have larger motion. The oblique processes of these bones of the neck more justly deserve that name than those of any other vertebrae. They are situated slanting ; the upper ones having their smooth and almost flat surfaces facing obliquely backwards and up- wards, while the inferior oblique processes have these surfaces facing obliquely forwards and down- wards. The transverse processes of these vertebrae are framed in a different manner from those of any other bones of the spine : For besides the com- mon transverse process rising from between the oblique processes of each side, there is a second that comes out from the side of the body of each vertebra ; and these two processes, after leaving a circular hole for the passage of the vertebral artery and vein, unite, and are considerably hol- lowed at their upper part, with rising sides, to protect the nerves that pass in the hollow ; and at last each side terminates in an obtuse point, for the insertion of muscles. The spinal processes of these cervical bones stand nearly straight backwards, are shorter than those of any other vertebrae, and are forked or double at their ends; and hence allow a more convenient insertion to muscles. The thick cartilages between the bodies of these cervical vertebra, the obliquity of their oblique N2

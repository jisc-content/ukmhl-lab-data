OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. the fore-part of the foot outwards*. From the lower internal part of the malleolus internus, li- gaments are extended to the astragalus, os cal- cis, and os naviculare, bones of the foot; and from its inside, short strong ones go out to the as- tragalus. On the back-part of it, a sinuosity is made by the tendons of the peronaei muscles. When the ligament extended over these tendons from the one side of the depression to the other is broke, stretched too much, or made weak by a sprain, the tendons frequently start forwards to the out- side of the fibula. The upper end of the fibula is united with the tibia by plain surfaces tipped with cartilage ; and at its lower end the cartilage seems to glue the two bones together ; not, however, so firmly in young people, but that the motion at the other end of such a long radius is very observable f. In old subjects, I often see the two bones of the leg grown together at their lower ends. This bone affords origin and insertion to mus- cles, the direction of which may be a little alter- ed on proper occasions, by its upper part shuffling backwards and forwards. It likewise renders the ! articulation of the foot more secure and firm.

In the following pages, it is proposed to adopt such names as are descriptive of the situation of the muscles ; and where a muscle has several ori- gins, it is necessary to employ such a name as de- scribes the chief origins and insertions only, in or- der to avoid wmrds of many syllables. Origin and Insertion of Muscles. A muscle is said by anatomists to consist of a belly and two extremities. The belly is composed of a great number of • fleshy fibres; and to the extremities of many of the muscles, a white glistening coi^d or membrane is connected, called tendon, or tendinous aponeurosis, by which many of the muscles are fixed to the bones. The extremity, which is connected to the most fixed part, is named the head, or origin of the muscle ; and the other extremity, fixed to the more moveable part, the insertio?i of the muscle.

292 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. side out of the cavities of the first vertebra*. In some subjects each of these plain smooth surfaces seems to be divided by a small rising in its mid- dle, and the lower edge of each condyle next the great foramen is discontinued about the mid- dle, by an intervening notch; Whence some f allege, that each of these apophyses is made up of two protuberances. Round their root a small depression and spongy roughness is observable, where the ligaments for surrounding and securing their articulations adhere. The motion of the head is performed on the condyles, but its centre of gravity does not fall between them, but further forward ; hence the muscles which pull the head back, must be in a constant state of contraction ; else the head would always fall forwards, as it does when a man is asleep, or labours under a palsy, as well as in in- fants, where the weight of the head far exceeds the proportional strength of these muscles. This seeming disadvantageous situation of the condyles, gives sufficient space for the cavities of the mouth and fauces, and for lodging a sufficient number of muscles, which commonly serve for other uses; but may at pleasure be directed to act on the head, and then act with an advantageous lever, so as to be able to sustain a considerable weight * Galen, de usu part. lib. 12. cap. 7. / ‘t PiEMERBROECK, Anat. lib. 9« cap. 6.

2S8 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. ced by the air within the lungs, during inspira- tion. The ends of the ribs next the vertebrae afe rounder than they are after these bones have ad- vanced forwards, v/hen they become flatter and broader, and have an upper and lower edge, each of which is made rough by the action of the in- tercostal muscles, inserted into them. Which mus-f cles, being of nearly equal force, and equally stretched in the interstices of the ribs, prevent the broken ends of these bones in a fracture ^om. be- ing removed far out of their natural place, to in- terrupt the motion of the vital organs. The upper edge of the ribs is more obtuse and rounder than the lower, which is depressed on its internal side by a long fossa, for lodging the inter- costal vessels and nerves ; on each side of which there is a ridge, to which the intercostal muscles are fixed. The fossa is not observable, however, at either end of the ribs ; for at the posterior or root, the vessels have not yet reached the ribs; and, at the fore-end, they are split away into branches : hence the greater safety of perform- ing the operation of the empyema towards the sides of the thorax, than either near the back or the breast. At the posterior end of each rib, a little head is formed, which is divided by a middle ridge into two plane or hollow surfaces; the lowest of which is the broadest and deepest in most of them. The

OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. rally there is a small mark of the os metacarpi digit! annularis on its external side. OJ the Os Unciforme. The Os Unciforme * has got its name from a . thin broad process that stands out from it forwards into the palm, and is hollow on its inside, for af- fording passage to the tendons of the flexors of the fingers. To this process also the transverse ligament is fixed, that binds down and defends these tendons and the flexor and abductor mus- cles of the little finger have part of their origin from it. The upper plain surface is small, convex, and joined with the os lunare. The internal side is long, and slightly convex, adapted to the contiguous os magnum. The external surface is oblique, and irregular- ly convex, to be articulated with the cuneiform bone. The lower end is divided into two concave sur- faces ; the external is joined with the metacarpal bone of the little finger, and the internal one is fitted to the metacarpal bone of the ring-finger. In the description of the preceding eight bones, I have mentioned only those plain surfaces cover- ed with cartilage, by which they are articulated to each other, or to some other bones, except in * Cuneiforme.

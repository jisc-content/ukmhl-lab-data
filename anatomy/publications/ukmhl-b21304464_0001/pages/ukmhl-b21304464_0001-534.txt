306 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. % the upper surface there is a rough fossa. Below, the os naviculare is very unequal and rough; but hollow for the safety of the muscles. On its in- side a large knob rises out, from which the ab- ductor pollicis takes in part its origin, and the ten- don of the tibialis posticus is inserted into it; And to it two remarkable ligaments are fixed ; the first is the strong one, formerly mentioned, which sup- ports the astragalus ; the second is stretched from this bone obliquely across the foot, to the metatar- sal bones of the middle toe, and of the toe next to the little one. On the outside of the os navicu- lare there is a semicircular smooth surface, where it is joined to the os cuboides. The fore-part of this bone is all covered with cartilage, and is di- vided into three smooth planes, fitted to the three ossa cuneiformia. The os naviculare and astragalus are joined as a ball and socket, and the naviculare moves in all directions in turning the toes inwards, or in rais- ing or depressing either side of the foot, though the motions are greatly restrained by the ligaments â€¢which connect this to the other bones of the tar- sus. A weakness of these ligaments causes some- times an unnatural turn of the fore-part of the foot inwards *. The os naviculare is wholly cartilaginous in a new-born infant. * The deformity in cases of club-foot is chiefly owing to the distortion of the os naviculare.

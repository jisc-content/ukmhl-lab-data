OUTLINES OF ANATOMY, These bones are joined to each other by fire sutures; the names of which, are the coronal^ lambdoidy sagittal, and two squamous. The coronal * suture is extended over the head, from within an inch or so of the external canthus of one eye, to the like distance from the other ; which being near the place where the ancients wore their mtt(2, corona, or garlands, this suture has hence got its name. Though the indenta- tions of this suture are conspicuous in its upper part, yet an inch or more of its end on each side has none of them ; for it is squamous and smooth there. The lambdoidal\ suture begins some way be- low, and farther back than the vertex or crown of the head, whence its two legs are stretched obliquely downwards, and to each side in form of the Greek letter A, and are now generally said to extend themselves to the base of the skull; but formerly anatomists % reckoned the proper lahabdoid suture to terminate at the squamous sutures, and what is extended at an angle down from that on each side, where the indentations are less conspicuous than in the upper part of the suture, they called* additamentum sutura lambdoidis §. • 'Lripccittlu, arcualis, puppis. + Laud®, prorae, hypsyloides.

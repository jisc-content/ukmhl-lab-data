biSEASES OF BONES. H7 ‘‘ The flesh rising from such a spongy root is very soft, and of such a tender texture as to be easily lacerated, and frequently pours out blood. “ The patient becomes atrophic and weak. “ With regard to the prognosis, the more the cause of this disease is rooted in the constitution, by its being hereditary, or ingrafted by a nurse, the more dangerous it is. “ The greater progress, or more universal at- tack the disease has made on the bone, the worse it is to cure. “ The more advanced the hectic fever is, the danger is greater. “ In children, the earlier it begins so much the worse, for such are longer of obtaining the vis vita2 necessary to conquer it. When the spina ventosa depends on pox or scurvy in adults, this disease must be forced out of the blood, by the re- medies proper to each, and the topical manage- ment is the same as for caries occasioned by other matter'lodged within a bone. “ When children have it, they are to be streng- thened, for I never saw any benefit from the com- mon specifics, ^thops mineral, cinnabar, &c. and the salivating preparations of mercury, have a bad effect; they bring the patients soon to their grave, by bringing on the hectic fever, with its colloqua- tions. Purgatives frequently given produce ,the same bad effects*.” K2 * The above Observations on Spina Ventosa are printed ver« hatw from a Manuscript of my Grandfather.

These and the other cavities which open into the nose, increase the sound of our voice, and render it more melodious, by serving as so many vaults to resound the notes. Hence, people labour- ing under a coryza, or stoppage of the nose from any other cause, when they are by the vulgar, though falsely, said to speak through their nose, have such a disagreeable harsh voice.

J From this circumstance, combined with the greater nar- rowness of the pelvis, the greater shortness of the necks of the thigh-bones, the want of solidity in the foot, arising from some of the bones which compose it, being in a state of cartilage, the gr eater proportional bulk and weight of the head, and the weak- ness of the extensor muscles, it is evident, that an infant cannot maintain its body in the erect posture.

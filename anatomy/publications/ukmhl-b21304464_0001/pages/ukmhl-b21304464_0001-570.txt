OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 542 Sect. II. FRONT VIEâ€™IY. The OS sacrum is united to the ossa innomina- ta by very strong ligaments, from which there is a ligament which sweep along the upper aper- ture of the pelvis. There are small apertures in the above ligament for the passage of the lumbar nerves. The crural arch is seen extending from the an- terior and superior spinous process of the ilium, and with its fibres inserted into the opposite os pubis, a few ligamentous fibres extend downwards from the superior and anterior spinous process of the os ilium, to the inferior and anterior spinous process of the os ilium. There is a strong capsular ligament at the sym- physis pubis, from which there is a round and strong ligament, which descends to the tuberosity of the ischium, which joins with the capsular liga- ment of the pubis, and is united by a few trans- verse ligamentous fibres, to a similar ligament of the opposite side. The obturator foramen is filled up by a liga- ment, in which there is a large aperture for the obturator artery and nerve, and three other small apertures, from which small branches of the ob-

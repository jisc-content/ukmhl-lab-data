198 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. in which the vertebral arteries make the circu- lar turn, as they are about to enter the great fora- men of the occipital bone, and where the tenth pair of nerves goes out. In several bodies, I have seen this fossa covered with bone. The inferior oblique processes extending from within outwards and downwards, are large, concave, and circular. So that this vertebra, contrary to the other six, receives the bones with which it is articulated both above and below. The transverse processes are not much hollow- ed or forked, but are longer and larger than those of any other vertebra of the neck, for the origin and insertion of several muscles ; of which those that serve to move this vertebra on the second have a considerable lever to act with, because of the distance of their insertion from the axis of revolution. The hole for the spinal marrow is larger in this than in any other vertebra, lest the spinal marrow should be hurt by the motions of this vertebra on the second one. This large hole, and the long transverse processes, make this the broadest ver- tebra of the neck. The condyles of the os occipitis move forwards and backwards in the superior oblique processes of this vertebra ; but the figure of the bones forming these joints, admits of very little motion to either side ; and there must be still less circu- lar motion.

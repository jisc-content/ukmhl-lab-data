226 OUTLINES Ot ANATOMY. The lower, thinner, more scabrous part of the knob which bends forwards, is also marked with two flat surfaces, whereof the internal is what we lean upon in sitting, and the external gives rise to the largest head of the triceps adductor femoris Between the external margin of the tuberosi- ty and the great hole of the os innominatum, there is an obtuse ridge extended down from the acetabulum, which give sorigin to the qua- dratus femoris. As the tuber advances forwards, it becomes smaller, and is rough, for the ori- gin of the musculus transversalis f and erector penis. The small leg of it, which mounts upwards to join the os pubis, is rough and prominent at its edge, where the two lower heads of the triceps or quadriceps adductor femoris :j; take their rise. The upper and back part of the os^ ischium is broad and thick; but its lower and fore-part is narrower and thinner. Its substance is of the structure common to broad bones.

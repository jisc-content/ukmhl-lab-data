150 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. them *. 3. That the muscles which move the spine, act with greater force in bringing the trunk to an erect posture, than in drawing it to any other: for in bending forwards, backwards, or to a side, the muscles which perform any of these ac- tions are nearer the centre of motion; consequent- ly, the lever with which they act is shorter, than when the centre of motion is on the part of tlie mrtbra, opposite to that where these mucles arc inserted, which is the case in raising the trunk. This is extremely necessary; since, in the deflec- tions of the spine from a perpendicular bearing, the weight of the body soon inclines it which way we design ; whereas, in raising us erect, this great weight must be more than counteracted. 4. In calculating the force exerted by the mus- cles which move the spiile, we should always make allowance for the action of the cartilages be- tween the ^vertebra, which, in every motion from an erect posture, must be stretched on one side, and compressed on the other, to both which they resist; whereas, in raising the trunk, these car- tilages assist by their springy force f. 5. We are hence naturally led into the reason of our height of stature increasing in the morn- ing, and diminishing at night |: for the inter- • Paaw de ossib. part. 2. cap, 2, ’ t BorelH dc motu animal, pars 1. schol. ad propos. 58.

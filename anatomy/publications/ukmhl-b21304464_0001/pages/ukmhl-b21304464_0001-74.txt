OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 46 these parts are fixed to that membrane, and lose the sliding motion they had upon it; as we sec daily in issues, or any other tedious suppurations near a bone. When the vessels which go from the periosteum to the bones are broken or eroded, a collection of liquor is made between them, which produces a sordid ulcer, or rotten bone. This is often the case after fractures of bones, and inflam- mations of the periosteum, or after small-pox, measles, and erysipelas. The Bloodvessels ojâ€™ Bones. After a successful injection, the arteries of the bones may be traced in their course from the pits to the plates and fibres of the bones, by removing the earth of the bone, by putting it into the nitric or muriatic acid ; and in sawing, cutting, or rasp- ing the bones of a living animal, drops of blood are discharged even from the most solid parts of the bones. That a great number of arteries enter into the composition of the bones, is obvious from the ef- fect of madder given along with the food of an animal, which gradually communicates its tinge to every part of the bone. The arteries are larger near each end than at the middle of the large bones, because they are not only distributed upon the bony plates near the ends, but pass through them to the marrow. As

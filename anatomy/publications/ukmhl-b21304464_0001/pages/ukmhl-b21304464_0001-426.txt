398 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. These ligaments,, which are of unequal size, arc placed towards the posterior and inferior part of the pelvis. Those ligaments which are incorporated with the posterior ligaments of the spinej arise from the transverse processes of the os sacrum, and from the upper part of the ossa coccygis. The larger or posterior^ is fixed, by its smaller extremity, into the tuberosity of the os ischium ; and the smaller or anterior^ which is disposed nearly transversely, is fixed into the spine of the os ischium. There are two membranous productions connec- ted to the larger sacro-ischiatic ligament, which have been named the superior and inferior appen- dices of it. The superior appendix arises from the back- part of the spine of the os ilium, and is fixed along the outer edge of the sacro-sciatic liga- ment. The inferior appendix is placed within the cavity of the pelvis, and is connected with the middle of the external sacro-ischiatic ligament. The obturator ligament fills up the foramen obturatorium ; in this there are apertures for the obturator artery, vein, and nerve. There are also longitudinal ligamentous fibres extending along the os sacrum and ossa coccygis, which serve to bind the several bones intimately to each other.

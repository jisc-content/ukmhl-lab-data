499 MOVEMENTS OF THE KNEE. the thigh outwards, that posterior part of the cross ligament prevents the legâ€™s being turned at all in- wards ; but it could not hinder it from turning outwards almost round, was not that motion con- fined by the lateral ligaments of this joint, which can yield little. This rotation of the leg-outwards, is of great use to us in crossing our legs, and turning our feet out- wards, on several necessary occasions ; though it is altogether fitthismotion should not be very large, to prevent frequent luxationshere. While all these mo- tions are performing, the part of the tibia that moves immediately on the condyles is only so much as is within the cartilaginous rings, which, by the thick- ness on their outsides, make the cavities of the ti- bia more horizontal, by raising their external side where the surface of the tibia slants downwards. By this means the motions of this joint are more equal and steady than otherwise they wofrid have been. The cartilages being capable of changing a little their situation, are fit for doing this good office in the different motions and postures of the member, and likewise contribute to make the mo- tions larger and quicker. Luxations of the knee-joint are very rare, on account of the very large surface of the bones forming the joint of the knee, and the many strong ligaments connecting them. Ii2

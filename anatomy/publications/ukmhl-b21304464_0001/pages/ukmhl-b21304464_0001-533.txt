OF THE FOOT. *505 the abductor minimi digiti, have their origin *, and the other part of the abductor minimi digiti and aponeurosis plantaris rise from the external. Before these protuberances this bone is concave, for lodging the flexor muscles ; and at its fore-part we may observe a rough depression, from which, and a tubercle behind it, the ligament goes out that prevents this bone from being separated from â€˜the os cuboides. The fore-part of the os calcis is formed into an oblong pulley-like smooth surface, which is circular at its upper external end, but is pointed below. This smooth surface is fitted to the os cu- boides. - Though the surfaces by which the astragalus and os calcis are articulated, seem fit enough for motion ; yet the very strong ligaments by which these bones are connected, prevent it, and render this principal part of our base which rests on the ground, to-wit, the os calcis, firm. A large share of the heel-bone is ossified at the ordinary time of birth, and the large knob appears afterwards in form of an epiphyse. Of the Os Naviculare. The Os Naviculare * is somewhat circular. It is formed into an oblong concavity behind for re- ceiving the anterior head of the astragalus. On * l,Kx<poiti)K, OS cymbae.

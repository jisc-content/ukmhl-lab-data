236 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. The form of the cavity of the pelvis of the in- fant, is widely different from that of the adult. The pelvis is not completely formed until the period of puberty. In very early life, the pelvis somewhat resembles a cone, of which the coccyx and tuberosities of the ischia form the apex, and the ilium the base, or the proportions of the pelvis are precisely op- posite to those of the pelvis of the. adult. Upon the various causes of deformity of the pelvis, the reader may consult Sandifort’s Mus. Lugd. Batav. Smellie’s Midwifery. Dr Hull’s Tables. Edin. Med. Phys. Jour. vol. vi. Of the Thorax. The thorax*y or chest, reaches from below the neck to the belly ; and, by means of the bones that gugrd it, is formed into a large cavity; the figure of which is somewhat con- choidal f, but its upper smaller end is not finished, being left open for the passage of the windpipe, gullet, and. large bloodvessels; ^ind its lower part. * Pectus, cassum. t The figure of the thorax is very various; in some it is large and elevated, but in others flat and contracted: and frequently in consequence of improper compression. Stays tightly laced de-. form the chest, and by interrupting the functions of the con- tained viscera, often lay the foundation of bad health.

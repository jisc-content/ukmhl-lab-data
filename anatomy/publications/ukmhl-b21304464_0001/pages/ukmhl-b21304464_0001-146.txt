I IIB OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. lique than straight muscles in the human body, and in the bodies perhaps of all other animals ; or that in the greater number of muscles, the fleshy fibres arc shorter than the direct length between the tendons at their extremities, or between the origins and insertions of the muscles. And the number of oblique muscles is still greater in fishes and aquatic animals, as a greater force is necessary to overcome the resistance of water than that ot ' air. 2. When oblique muscles, consisting of the same number of fibres as straight muscles, are placed between two parallel lines, or between bones or other substances, which, when they are moved, remain parallel to each other, or nearly so, al- though their loss in strength be exactly in the pro- portion which their length bears to the direct di- stance between the parallel lines, yet we have found that they are capable of performing a much more extensive motion with the same proportion- al decurtation of fibres, or a motion of the same extent with less decurtation of fibres. Nay, that they are capable of bringing the parallel lines in- to contact with each other, which it is evidently impossible could be done by straight muscles. The most striking instance of this kind is found in the intercostal muscles; for in this part of the body, nature, for th^ defence of the heart and lungs, forms the ribs as broad, and the spaces be- tween them as narrow, as is consistent with their safety. Hence straight or perpendicular muscles

I06 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. If the edges and middle parts of such muscles are in the same plane, they co-operate, of which the temporal and trapezius may be examples. But in others, as in the deltoid, the fibres are not in the same plane, but inclose a joint, and its oblique sides may be antagonists to its middle in one pos- ture of the arm, viz. its hanging posiure, but may co-operate with it when the arm is elevated. 3. In many muscles the fibres are parallel, or nearly so, to each other, but are laid obliquely be- tween tendinous membranes, or between a bone and a tendinous membrane ; and as their fleshy fibres resemble in their direction the plumage on one side of the stalk of a feather, they have been called stnupentnjorm muscles. The flexors and extensors of the whole hand or foot, and the flex- ors and extensors of the fingers and toes, furnish striking examples of this kind of structure ; (see Plate 2. fig. 2. of this Treatise.) 4. In some places the fleshy fibres run from both sides obliquely downwards, or obliquely upwards to a tendon in the middle of the muscles, resem-. bling in their direction the plumage on both sides of the stem of a feather ; and hence such are call- ed complete penniform muscles. The flexor longus pcllicis pedis (see Albinus) is an example, in which the fibres descend ; and the rectus ex- tensor cruris (see Plate 2. fig. 3.) an example in which ,they ascend from the sides of the muscle to the middle tendon. When we compare a com- plete penniform muscle with a ^semipenniforin

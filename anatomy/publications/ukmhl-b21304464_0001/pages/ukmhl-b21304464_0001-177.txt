To this form of gangrene of bones, the term Nec7'usi6' has been mnmonly, but Improperly applied, as it is equally descriptive of gangrene of the soft- er parts. The necrosis is most frequent in the middle of such bones as are but slightly covered, as of the lower Jaw'*, the tibia *, os humeris, clavicles, and sel- dom or never extends to the extremities of the bones.

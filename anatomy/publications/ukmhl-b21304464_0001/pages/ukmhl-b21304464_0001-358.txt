330 ' OUTLINES OF ANATOMY/ noid, which is commonly, but unjustly called an- trum highmorianum *. When the os maxillare is single or separated from all the other bones of a skeleton, its antrum appears to have a large aperture into the nostrils; but, in a recent subject, it is so covered at its back- part by the palate bone ; in the middle, by the os spongiosum inferius ; before, by a strong mem- brane, that one, or sometimes txvo holes scarce larger than a crow-quill^ are only left at the upper part; which after a short winding progress, open into the nostrils between the two ossa spongiosa. At the bottom of this cavity, we may often ob- serve some protuberances, in which the small points of the roots of the teeth are contained f. This cavern, and the sockets of the teeth are often divided by the interposition only of a very thin bony plate, which is liable to be eroded by acrid matter collected in the antrurn, or to be broke in drawing a tooth The symptoms of a collection of matter here naturally lead . us to the practice of pulling out the teeth, and piercing through this plate into the antrum, to procure an evacuation of the collected mat- ter ; by w'hich considerable service is frequently done ||. • Gense. + Highmore, Disquis.

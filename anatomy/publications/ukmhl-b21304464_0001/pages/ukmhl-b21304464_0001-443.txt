The external condyle, which has an oblique di- rection also forwards in respect of the internal, \vhen the arm is in the most natural posture * * * ยง, is equally broad, and has, an obtuse smooth head rising from it forwards. From the rough part of the condyle, the infe- rior head of the bicornis f, the extensor digitorum communis, extensor carpi ulnaris :jl anconseus, and some part of the supinator radii brevis, take their rise ; and on the smooth head the upper end of the radius plays. Immediately on the outside of this, there is a sinuosity made by the shorter head of the bicornis muscle, upon which the muscular nerve is placed. The internal condyle is more pointed and pro- tuberant than the external, to give origin to some part of the flexor carpi radialis ยง, pronator radii teres, palmaris longus, flexor digitorum sublimus, and flexor carpi ulnaris [j. Between the two condyles, is the trochlea or pully, which consists of two lateral protuberances, and a middle cavity, that are smooth and covered with cartilage. * Winslow, Memoires de I'Acad. des Sciences, 1722. t Radialis extemus.

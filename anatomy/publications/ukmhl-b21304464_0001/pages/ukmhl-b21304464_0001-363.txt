Along the outside of this plate, the perpendicular fossa made by the palate nerve is observable. At the upper part of this nasal plate, the palate bone divides into two processes, which I already named ; between which and the body of the sphenoid bone, that hole is formed, which I> mentioned as the last of the holes common to the’ sphenoid bone. Sometimes this hole is wholly formed in the os palati, by a cross platfe going from the one orbitar process to the other. Ai nerve, artery, and vein belonging to the nostrils' pass here. The anterior of the two orbitar pro-- cesses is the largest, and has its fore-part con-’ tiguous to the back-part of the maxillary sinus, and its upper surface appears in the bottom of the orbit, behind the back-part of the os maxillare and planum f.

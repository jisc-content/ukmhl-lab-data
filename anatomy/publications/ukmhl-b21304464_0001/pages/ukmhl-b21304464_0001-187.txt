159 DISEASES OF BOJ^ES. the disease, and is not attended by any loss or de- struction of substance, and seems to be produced by means of the hifammation attacking the carti- lages, which is succeeded by the accretion of the bones. This variety of the disease is also the conse- quence of caries of the bones, the articular carti- lages being destroyed, the diseased surfaces of the bones are in immediate contact, and frequently grow together. In the second species of anchylosis, the bones are united by means of a shell of bone, which sup- plies the place of the capsular ligament in the joint. General Observations on Fracture. The bones of the old, which contain a large quantity of earth, are more frequently fractured than those of the young. Those bones which are slightly covered, are more readily broken than the deeper-seated bones. The bones of persons afflicted by cancer, gout, scurvy, and scrof ula, are readily broken. Louis and Saviard have described cases, in which the bones of women afflicted with cancer were broken by so slight an effort as the turning in bed. Some bones, from their situation and office, are much exposed to fracture : thus, the long bones of extremities are often broken, as these serve as pillars or levers.

OUTLINIS OF ANATOMY. Bones are more or lesss cavernous internally. In some (e. g. middle thin part of the scapula and os ilium) the solid sides are brought so near, that little cavity can be seen ; and in others (mid- die of os humeri, femoris, &-c.) the cavities are so large, that such bones are generally esteemed to be hollow or fistular. But the internal spongy texture is evident in young animals ; and some of it may be seen to remain in those of greatest age, when bones are cautiously opened, after they have been kept so long as to be free of the oil they con- tain, or after being burnt. This spongy cavernous internal part of bones, is generally called their cancellior lattice-work, and is formed in the following manner: The plates are firmly joined about the middle of the bone ; but as they are extended towards its ends, the more internal plates separate from the exte- rior, and stretch out their fibres towards the axis of the bone, where they are interwoven with the fibres of other plates that have been sent off in the same way. Seeing the plates are thus con- stantly going off, the solid sides of the bones must become thinner. This is evident in many of them, where the solid sides of their mid- dle are very thick, and the cancelli are scarcely observable ; whereas, at the ends, where their diameter is greatest, the solid walls or sides are not thicker than paper, and the cancelli are nu- merous and large enough to fill up the whole space left between the sides.

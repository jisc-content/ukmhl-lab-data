OF THE OSSA MAXILLARIA SUPERIORA. 331 The maxillary sinuses have the same uses as the frontal and sphenoidal; and the situation of the â€™ sinuses is such, that the liquor distilling from them, from the cells of the ethmoid and palate-bones, and from the lacrymal ducts, may always moisten all the parts of the membrane of the nares in th? different situations which the head is in. The membrane, which lines the frontal, sphe- noidal, and maxillary sinuses, is a continuation of the one which covers the bones within the nose ; but much thirmer, and it has but few bloo'd- vessels. The substance of the ossa maxillaria is com- pact and firm, except at the inferior process, in which the teeth are lodged, where it is very spongy. The maxillary bones are joined above by the upper ends of their nasal processes to the os fron- tis, by the transverse suture ; at the sides of these processes, to the ossa unguis, by the lacrymal su- tures ; to the nasal bones, by the lateral nasal su- tures ; by their orbitar processes, to the cheek- bones, by the external orbitar sutures ; by the in- ternal sides of the internal orbitar processes, to the ossa plana, by part of the ethmoidal suture ; by the back-part of the tuberosities, to the palate- bones, by the suturm palato-maxillares; by the posterior edges of their palatine lamellae, to the ossa palati, by the transverse palate suture; by their nasal spines, to the vomer, by the spinous suture ; by their sockets, to the teeth by gqmpho-

OF THE FOOT. 503 extended, but can be moved laterally only in a slight degree. When the foot is bended, so far as it is commonly when we stand, no lateral or rotatory motion is allowed in this joint; for then the head of the astragalus is sunk between the malleoli, and the ligaments are tense ; but when the foot is extended, the astragalus can move a little to either side, and with a small rotation. By this contrivance, the foot is firm, when the weight of the body is to be supported on it; and when a foot is raised, we are at liberty to direct it more exactly to the place we intend next to step upon. The astragalus is join- ed, below, to the os calcis; and before, to the os naviculare; in the manner to be explained, when these bones are described. A considerable share of this bone is ossified in a new-born infant. Of the Os Calcis. The Calcaneum * or Os Calcis is the largest bone of the seven. Behind, it is formed into a large knob, commonly called the heel: The surface of which is rough behind, where the tendo achillis is inserted into it; and above, it is hollow and spongy. Farther forwards, on the upper surface of the calca- neum, there is an irregular oblong smooth convexi- ty, adapted to the concavity at the back-part of I i 4 Oe calcis, calcar pedis.

LIGAMENTS OF THE KNEE-JOINT. 547 There are a number of fringes connected with the synovial apparatus, from which the synovia may be squeezed out. The edges of the synovial apparatus are retained in their situation by small ligamentous fibres. Sect. V, OF THE CARTILAGES AND LIGAMENTS OF THE KNEE-JOINT. The knee-joint is formed by the contact of the condyles of the thigh-bone with the head of the tibia, and back-part of the rotula. These bones, which are covered by articular cartilages, are kept together by various liga- ments. There is a strong capsular ligament, which is connected to the circumference of the lower end of the thigh-bone, and is fixed to the head of the tibia, and the margin of the articulating surface of the patella, so that the patella forms a part of the capsule of the joint. â€¢ This ligament is strengthened by lateral liga- ments, which adhere to its outer surface, and also by a tendinous aponeurosis from the tendons of the extensor muscles, and by the general tendinous aponeurosis of the limb. There are two external lateral ligaments, the longer and stronger extends from the tubercle, Mm2

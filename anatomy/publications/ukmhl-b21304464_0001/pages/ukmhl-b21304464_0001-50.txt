22 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. tion of two bones, I must beg leave to change the definitions and kinds of these joints. I Would call diarthrosis that conjunction of bones, whereby they are fitted for motion, being each covered with a smooth cartilage, connected by one or more common ligaments, and lubricated with liquor at the conjoined parts. In which definition, I have no regard to the quantity of motion which they really do perform ; the motion being often confined or enlarged by some other cause not immediately -depending on the frame of the two surfaces of the bones forming the particu- lar joint which then is considered. The first species of the diarthrosis, viz. the enar- throsis or ball and socket, I would define more generally than above ;â€”That articulation where a round head of one bone is received into a cavity of another, and consequently, without some fo- reign impediment, is capable of motion to all sides. Examples of this kind are to be seen in the articu- lation of the thigh-bone and ossa innominata ; Arm-bone and scalpula ; astragalus and os navicu- lare ; magnum of the wrist, with the scaphoides and lunare; the metacarpal and metatarsal bones - with the first bones of the fingers and toes, fee. The second sort, or the arthrodia, differing from the enarthrosis, in the preceding account, only in the cavity being more superficial, which makes ,no essential difference, especially as, in the re- cent subject, cartilages or ligaments supply the de- ficiency of bone, ought, in my opinion, to be called,

OF THE FORM OF THC SKULL. ~ 357 But some anatomists do not subscribe to such an opinion, and suppose that the skull serves not only to limit the growth of the brain, but also to determine its peculiar shape. I confess that the former seems to me the more rational hypothesis. That the cranium owes its shape chiefly to the extension of the contained parts, and the resistance of the external organs, seems proved, or at least rendered probable, as the brain and cerebellum of the foetus are formed, long before the skull, and it,is impressed by the brain. It may be readily supposed, that -the bones of the skull, which in the foetal state are formed be- tween the pericranium and dura mater, and which are originally in a soft and clastic state, should take on the shape of their contents. The ossification of the skull goes on but slowly ; it is not completed until the child has attained its third or fourth year, and often not until a later much attention to the form of the head in different diseases. He has said, that in the phthisical, there is a shining bright- ness of the eyes, a lengthening of the line between the orbits, and a hollowness about the temples. From hydrocephalus chro- nicus, that the eye is thrust forward, and half of it hid under the eye-lid, and that the visage is enlarged, and altered from its na- tural shape. / In the scrofulous, the head is enlarged, particularly about the occiput. And he has added, that when epilepsy is connec- ted with an organic defect of brain, this is peculiarly marked by the facial angle of 70° to 71®. In one case he observed it be- low 70°. Sucli patients, according to him, arc not curable, but i]»e epilepsy is curable when the facial angle amounts to 80°, 7^3

103 MYOLOGY. to calculate, by means of a spring steel-yard, the force of muscles of animals and men ; but when we consider, that one man is stronger than another in the legs, whilst another is stronger in the hands^ and a third can lift a much greater weight,—the effect of habit in giving strength, mobility, and dexterity in the use of particular muscles, and the astonishing muscular efforts which delicate women are capable of making during a paroxysm of hys- teria or mania, the insufficiency of such calculations appears obvious, being applicable to individual cases only, and even when we set aside the various causes which I shall enumerate, which tend to di- minish the force of the muscles. • The causes which tend to diminish the force of muscles are, 1st, Half the power is exerted on a fixed part of the body. 2dl^, When muscles act in concert, they do not act in the same line; hence the force must be as in the diagonal, and thus the muscular contraction is divided between different muscles, and fatigue of any particular muscle is avoided. S(I/^, A great source of loss of power, results from the obliquity of the insertion of a muscle into the bone wdiich it is intended to move. Aihly, Perhaps there rnay be another cause of loss of power, owing to a muscle passing over two joints, where a considerable part of its force is expended in pressing one bone against another ^t the articulation.

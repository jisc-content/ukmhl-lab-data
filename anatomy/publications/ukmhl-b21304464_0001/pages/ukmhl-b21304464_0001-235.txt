OF THE SPINE. SO 7 i! !' il t! j I ij i :■! The spinous processes of the vertebrae of the back become gradually longer and more slanting from the first, as far down as the eighth or ninth vertebra ; from which they manifestly turn short- er and more erect. The first * vertebra, besides an oblong hollow in its lower edge, that assists in forming the ca- vity wherein the second rib is received, has the whole cavity for the head of the first rib formed in it. The second has the name of axillary f, without any thing particular in its structure. The eleventh X often has the whole cavity for the eleventh rib in its body, and wants the smooth surface on each transverse process. The twelfth |j always receives the whole head of the last rib, and has no smooth surface on its transverse processes, which are very short. The smooth surfaces of its inferior oblique pro- cesses face outwards as the lumbar do. And we may say, in general, that the upper vertebrae of the back lose gradually their resemblance to those of the neck, and the lower ones come nearer to the figure of the lumbar. The articulation of the vertebrae of the back with the ribs, shall be more particularly consider- < ed after the ribs are described.

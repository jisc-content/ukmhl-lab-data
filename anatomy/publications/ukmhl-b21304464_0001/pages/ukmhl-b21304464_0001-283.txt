OF THE STERNUM. 255 wards by the viscera, carry these ribs along with them. Thus the thorax is not only not allowed to be shortened, but is really widened at its lower part, to assist in making sufficient space for th? due distention of the lungs. As soon as the action of these several muscles ceases, the elastic cartilages extending themselves to their natural situation, depress the upper ribs, and the sternum subsides;â€”the diaphragm is thrust up by the visce;ra abdominalia, and the ob- lique and transverse muscles of the belly serve to draw the inferior ribs inwards at the same time. By these causes, the cavity of the breast is dimi- nished in all its dimensions. The motions above described of the ribs and sternum, especially of the latter bone, are so small in the mild respiration of a healthy person, that we can scarce observe them ; but whenever we designedly increase our respiration, or are obliged to do it after exercise, and in several diseases, they are obvious.

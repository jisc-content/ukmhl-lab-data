There are two sacro-sciatic ligaments^ the larger extends between the transverse processes of the os sacrum, the under and lateral part of that bone, and the tuberosity of the os ischium, •the other, which has a similar origin, is fixed into the spinous process of the os ischium. There are two membranous appendices con- nected to the above ligaments, the one increases the breadth of the upper ligament, the other ari- ses within the pelvis, and is fixed to the os is- chium. By the larger external ligament, the large notch in the ilium is converted into a hole for the pas- sage of the pyriform muscle, the great sciatic nerve, and the gluteal arteries. The muscle called obturator internus passes be-- tween the sacro-sciatic ligaments. The large holes in the back part of the os sa- crum, are in a great measure filled by ligaments, which project from one tubercle to another, and the back-part of the ossa coccygis is covered by ligaments which pass along these in a longitudinal direction, and which are fixed into the extremity of the last os coccygis *. * Loder’s Plates, xxi. and xxii. which represent the Liga* ments of the Pelvis, are very faithful copies of Nature.

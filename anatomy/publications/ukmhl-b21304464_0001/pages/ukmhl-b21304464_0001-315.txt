GT THE OSSA TEMPORUM. 287 sometimes two very small holes go off towards the cavity of the ear, called tympanum; through these Valsalva* affirms the proper artery or arteries of that cavity are sent. On the anterior edge of this bone, near the for- mer, a fourth hole is observable, being the orifice of a canal which runs outwards and backwards, in a horizontal direction, till it terminates in the tympanum. This, in the recent subject, is con- tinued forward and inward, from the parts which I mentioned just now as its orifice in the skeleton, to the side of the nostrils; being partly cartilagi- nous, and partly ligamentous. The whole ca- nal is named, iter a palato ad aiirem, or eustachian tube. On the external side of the bony part of this canal, and at the top of the chink in the cavity that receives the condyle of the lower jaw, is the course of the little nerve, said commonly to 'be reflected from the lingual branch of the fifth pair, till it enters the tympanum, to run across this cavity, and to have the name of chorda tympani. fifth hole is very uncertain, appearing some- times behind the mastoid process ; sometimes it is common to the temporal and occipital bones ; and in several skulls there is no such hole. The use of it, when found, is for the transmission of a vein from the external teguments to the lateral ■ " De Aure humana, cap. 2. § 22. et tab. 7. 6g. 1.

S2 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. the marrow, is returned by proper veins, which are collected from the membranes into one or two large trunks, to pass out at the same holes or pas- sages at which the artery or arteries enter. By experiments made on the marrow, when bones of living animals are opened or cut through *, «nd from the racking pain with which suppura- tions within bones are frequently attended, we have sufficient proof that the membranes here are sensible, and consequently have nerves distributed . to them. Hippocrates f might therefore say justly, that a wound penetrating into the cavity of a bone may produce a delirium. On the internal surface of the solid parts of bones, there are orifices of canals, which pass out- wards through the plates to open into other canals that are in a longitudinal direction, from which other transverse passages go out to terminate in other longitudinal canals ; and this structure is con- tinued through the whole substance of bones, both these kinds of canals becoming smaller gradually as they approach the outer surface X. These ca- nals are to be seen to the best advantage in a bone burnt till it is white : When it is broken trans- versely, the orifices of the longitudinal canals are in view ; and when we separate the plates, the transverse ones are to be observed.X * Du Verney, Memoires de Tacad. des sciences, I709. t Aphorism. § 7. aph. 24.

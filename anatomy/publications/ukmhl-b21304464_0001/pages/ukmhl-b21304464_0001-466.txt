438 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. flat and oblong, without any considerable head or cavity ; but it is how'ever somewhat hollowed, for the articulation with the carpus: It is made flat and smooth on the sides where these bones are contiguous to each other. Their bodies are flatted on their back-part by the tendons of the extensors of the fingers. The anterior surface of these bodies is a little concave, especially in their middle ; along which a sharp ridge stands out, which separates the mus- culi interossci placed on each side of these bones which are there made flat and plain by these muscles. Their lower ends are raised into large oblong smooth heads, whose greatest extent is forwards from the axis of the bone. At the fore-part of each side of the root of each of these heads, one or two tubercles stand out, for fixing the ligaments that go from one metacarpal bone to another, to preserve them^ from being drawn asunder. Round the heads, a rough ring may be remarked, for the capsular ligaments of the first joints of the fingers to be fixed to ; and both sides of these heads are flat, where they press on each other. The substance of the metacarpal bones is the same with that of all long bones. At the time of birth, these bones are cartilagi- â€¢ nous at both ends, which afterwards become epi- physes.

OUTLINES OF ANATOMY, 4S4 muscles of the hand; and both terminate in a com- mon sharp spine, to which the strong ligament extended betwixt the two bones of the fore-arm is fixed. A. little below the beginning of the plain sur- face, on its fore-part, where the flexor muscle of the last joint of the thumb takes its origin, the passage of the medullary vessels is seen slanting upwards. The radius becomes broader and flatter towards the lower end, especially on its fore-part, where its pronator quadratus muscle is situated. The lower end of the radius is larger than the superior ; though not in such a disproportion as the upper end of tlie ulna is larger than its lower end. Its back-part has a flat strong ridge in the mid- dle, and fossas on each side. In a small groove immediately on the outside of the ridge, the tendon of the extensor tertii in- ternodii pollicis plays. In a large one beyond this, the tendons of the indicator and of the common extensor muscles of the fingers pass. Contiguous to the ulna, there is a small depres- sion made by the extensor minimi digiti. On the inside of the ridge, there is a broad de- pression, which seems again subdivided, where the two tendons of the bicornis, or extensor carpi radialis are lodged. The internal side of this end of the radius is al- so hollowed by the extensors of the first and se-

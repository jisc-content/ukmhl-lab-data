The side opposite to this is somew’hat rounded. T. he middle of this protuberant end, is as irre- gularly hollowed, as the cavity in the sternum for receiving it, is raised ; but in a recent subject, the irregular concavities of both, are supplied by a moveable cartilage, which is not only much more closely connected every where by ligaments to the circumference of the articulation, than those of the lower jaw are ; but it grows to the two bones at both its internal and external end: its sub- stance at the internal end being soft, but very strong, and resembling the intervertebral carti- lages f. From this internal end, the clavicle, for about two fifths of its length, is bended obliquely for- wards and downwards. On the upper and fore- part of this curvature, a small ridge is seen, with a plain rough surface before it; whence the mus- culus sterno-hyoideus and sterno-mastoideus have in part their origin. Near the lower angle a small plain surface is often to be remarked, where the first rib and this * Riolan. Encheirid. Anat. lib. vi. cap. 13. Winslow^ Expos. Anat. des Os frais. § 248. Weitbrecut.

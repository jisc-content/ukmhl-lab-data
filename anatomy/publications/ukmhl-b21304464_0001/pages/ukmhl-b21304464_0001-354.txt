3^6 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. of the orbit. From the proper orbitar process, a very rough triangular surface is extended down- wards and outwards, to be connected to the cheek- bone ; and therefore may be called the malar pro- cess, from the lowest protuberant part of which some share of the masseter muscle takes its rise. Behind the orbitar process, a large tuberosity, or bulge of the bone appears, which is esteemed the fourth process. On the internal part of this we often meet wdth a ridge, almost of the same height with that in the nasal process, which runs trans- versely, and is covered by a similar ridge of the palate-bone, on which the back-part of the upper edge of the os spongiosum inferius rests. The convex back-part of this tuberosity is rough for the origin of part of the external pterygoid muscle *, and more internally is scabrous, where the palate and sphenoid bones are joined to it. That spongy protuberance f at the lovrcr circum- ference of this bone, where the sockets for the teeth are formed, is reckoned the fifth. The sixth is the horizontal plate, which forms the greater part of the base of the nostrils, and roof of the mouth ; its upper surface, which belongs to the nostrils, is very smooth, but the other be- low is arched and rough, for the stronger adhesion of the membrane of the mouth, which is stretched upon it, and in chewing, speaking,' &c. might * Albin. de Ossib. ยง 79* โข \ + faryiM.

OUTLINES OF ANATOMY^ 472 There is a ligament, of a rhumboidal figurOy which extends between the under surface of the clavicle, at no great distance from its neck, to the cartilage of the first rib. There is a ligament, called by Caldani bicornCy which arises from the coracoid process of the sca- pula, and ascends obliquely, and divides into two parts; the one of which is fixed into the inferior part of the clavicle near to the rhomboidal liga- ment ; the other part of it is fixed into the first rib, under the tendon of the subclavian muscle. There are two thin ligaments (between which there is a bursa mucosa,) which are stretched be- tween the coracoid process of the scapula, and the middle and under part c4' the clavicle, and between Jhese ligaments and the ligamentum bicorne, the subclavian muscle is placed. In this front view, the anterior proper ligament of the scapula is seen, passing between the cora- coid process of the scapula and the acromion sca- pul%% On the upper and fpre part of the capsular liga- ment of the shoulder-joint, the ligamentous mem- brane, which Weitbrecht has named adscitititty is seen ; and beneath it, the whole extent of the capsular ligament, covered and strengthened by the tendons of the adjacent muscles, and which is connected with the neck of the scapula, and is fixed into the neck of the os humeri. The long head of the biceps passes through the joint of the os humeri, and is confined within the

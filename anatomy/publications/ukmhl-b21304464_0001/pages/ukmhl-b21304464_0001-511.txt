483 OF THE THIGH. of the internal ridge, there is a discontinuation of the ridge, where the crural artery passes through the aponeurosis. Between these two rough lines, the bone is made flat by the large bloodvessels and nerves which pass upon it; and near the end of each of these ridges, a small smooth protuberance may often be remarked, where the two heads of the external ‘ gastrocnemius muscle take their rise, and where sesamoid bones are sometimes found * ; and from the fore-part of the internal tubercle, a strong ligament is extended to the inside of the tibia. The lower end of the os femoris is extended into a great protuberance on each side, called its condyLcs; between which, a considerable cavity is found, especially at the back-part, in which the crural vessels and nerves lie immersed in fat. The internal condyle is longer - than the external, which must happen from the oblique position of this bone, to give less obliquity to the leg. Each of these processes seems to be divided in its plain smooth surface. The mark of division on the external is a notch, and on the internal, a small protuberance. The fore-part of this divi- sion, on which the rotula moves, is formed like a pulley, the external side of which is highest. Be- Rh2 • Vesal. lib. 1. cap. 28. & SO.

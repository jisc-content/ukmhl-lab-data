OF THE SKULL AND CRANIOMETERS. 375 meatus auditorius externus; these instruments be- ing made of unyielding materials, do not adapt themselves to the inequalities of the surface of the skull. In illustration of what I have affirmed, I shall take the os frontis as an example. In the os frontis there are certain cavities, called sinuses, which scarcely exist at the period of birth, and which, during the progress of life, are con- stantly becoming larger; the common craniome- ter when applied to the os frontis, is laid along the most prominent part of this bone ; it therefore gives the angle which is formed by the projecting os frontis opposite to the frontal sinus, but not the angle formed by the os frontis above the frontal sinuses; so that the os frontis has been sometimes described as being very prominent, while in truth it was the reverse, the projection being caused by the large frontal sinuses, and not by the whole os frontis; and I have seen several persons whose foreheads were remarkably prominent at the fron- tal sinuses, but in which, the upper part of the os frontis retreated nearly as much as in the greatest number of African skulls. The above observation applies also to the skulls of quadrupeds ; for in these the frontal sinuses are much more capacious and extensive, than in the human body ; in some, as the elephant, they extend over the whole skull. Such are the imperfections of the present cra- niometers ; for which in my opinion, the one repre- Aa4

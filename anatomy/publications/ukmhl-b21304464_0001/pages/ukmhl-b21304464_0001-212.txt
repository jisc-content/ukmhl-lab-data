184i ' OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. different sexes, at the different periods of life, and in different nations, has usually been divided by anatomists into three parts, viz, into the head,, trunk and extremities. The Trunk. The trunk is subdivided into the Spine, Pelvis and Thorax. The Spine. The spine * is the long pile of bones extended from the condyles of the occiput to the end of the rump. It somewhat resembles two unequal pyra- mids joined in a common base. It is not, how- ever, straight; for its upper part being drawn backwards by strong muscles, it gradually advan- ces forwards, to support the oesophagus, vessels of the head, &c. Then it turns backwards, to make place enough for the heart and lungs. It is next bended forwards, to support the 'viscera of the ab- domen. It afterwards turns backwards, for the enlargement of the pelvis. The spine is commonly divided into true and false vertebrcE ; the former constituting the long upper pyramid, which has its base below, while ' the false tSertebra make the shorter lower pyra- , mid, the base of which is above. t "Lomazzo and some other Italian authors, as well as Albert Dureh, have written on proportion in a manner too fanciful and indiscriminate to be useful.” * viiro)i 5xa»9x, crwAfl”, tergum, horainis carina.

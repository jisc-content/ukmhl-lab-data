OF THE TIBIA. 487 The middle of each of these cartilages is broad, and the ends of them turn narrower and thinner, as they approach the middle protuberance of the tibia. The thick convex edge of each cartilage is connected to the capsular and other ligaments of the articulation, but so near to their rise from the tibia, that the cartilages scarcely change their place ; while the narrow ends of the cartilages becoming almost ligaments, are fixed at the in- sertion of the strong cross ligament into the tibia, and seem to be united with it; therefore a circu- lar hole is left between each cartilage and the liga- ment ^ in which the most prominent convex part of each condyle of the thigh-bone moves. The circumference of these cavities is rough and unequal, for the firm connexion of the liga- ments of the joint. Immediately below the edge at its back-part, there are two rough flatted pro- tuberances : Into the internal, the tendon of the semimembranosus muscle is inserted ; and a part of the cross ligament is fixed to the external. On the outside of this last tubercle, a smooth slightly- hollowed surface is formed by the action of the poplitasus muscle. Below the fore-part of the upper end of the tibia, there is a considerable rough protuberance *, to which the strong tendinous ligament of the ro- 'tula is fixed. Hh4 * 'Ayrkf/iftm, anterior tuber,

217 OF THE SPINE. 4 Immediately below the shoulders of the os coc- cygis, a notch may be remarked in each side, where the thirtieth pair of the spinal nerves passes. The lower end of this bone is formed into a small head, which very often is hollow in the middle. The three lower bones gradually become smaller^ and are spongy ; but are strengthened by a strong ligament which covers and connects them. Their ends, by which they are articulated, are formed in the same manner as those of the first bone are. Between each of these four bones of young sub- jects, a cartilage is interposed â€¢, like the bodies of the vertebrae of the neck ; For, as has been above remarked, the lower end of the os sacrum, and of each of the three superior bones of the os eoccygis, has a small depression in the middle; and the up- per part of all the bones of the os coccygis is a little concave, and consequently, the interposed cartilages are thickest in the middle, to fill up both cavities ; by which they connect the bones more firmly. When the cartilages oSsify, the up- per end of each bone is formed into a cavity, ex- actly adapted to the protuberant lower end of the bone immediately above. From this sort of articulation, it is evident, that, unless when these bones grow together, all of them are capable of motion ; of which, the first and second, especially this last, enjoys the largest share. The lower end of the fourth bone terminates

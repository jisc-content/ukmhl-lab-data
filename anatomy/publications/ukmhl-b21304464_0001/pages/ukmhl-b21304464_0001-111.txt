83 SYNOVIAi a'lubricating liquor, and though in fact, when we press upon them, we are sensible that it issues from them ; yet their cavities and orifices are so minute, that I have not yet been able to get a distinct view of them, though I employed magnifying glasses. “ These fimbriae seem, therefore, to be ducts, like to those of the urethra, which prepare a mu-' cilaginous liquor, without the assistance of any knotty or glandular organ ; while by the pressure which the motion of the joints or tendons makes upon their sides, they throw out their liquor in greatest quantity when it is most needed. Perhaps the secretion, as well as the excretion of the liquor, is promoted, as in the salivary glands, by motion ; and as the extremities of these fringes hang loose into the cavity of the joint, their liquor cannot be pressed back into them by the motion of the joint Upon the vdiole, the synovia seems to be fur^- • nished by invisible exhalant arteries,—by the ducts of the fimbriae,—and by oil exuding from the adipose follicles, by passages not yet discover- ed. We may suppose these passages to be very minute, not only because they are not to be seen by the microscope, but because the oily matter is so well incorporated with the mucilaginous, as not to be distinguishable even with the microscope, in the form of globules* F 2 5 Vid.

107 OBLIQUE MUSCLES. I muscle of the same breadth and thickness, as the number of its fibres is double, its strength will also be double to that of the semipennifonn muscle. 5. We may next observe a combination of seml- penniforra muscles in the extensors of the fore- arm or leg, or compound semiptnnijorm muscles. 6. In the soleus, we find a combination of com- plete penniform muscles, or a compound pennifoi'm muscle ; (see Plate 2. fig. 4.) 7. In many other places we find oblique muscles co-operating, although they are not joined to each other by common tendons ; as is the case of the two rows of intercostal muscles ; and in many of those which are fixed to the head and spine. The sterno-mastoid, splenii, complexi, semi-spinales, multifidus spinÂ®, are all of them evidently of that description. 2. Having described the various directions of the fibres in the muscular system, I shall now endea- vour to explain the effects these have in the mo- tions we perform. In many instances the obliquity of the fleshy fibres is so great, that the fibres are very much shorter than if they had run directly from what is.called the origin of the muscle to its insertion, or the fibres are much more numerous than if the same space had been covered by straight fibres. T. hus, suppose a straight muscle to be fifteen inches.long, and that this is cut transversely into

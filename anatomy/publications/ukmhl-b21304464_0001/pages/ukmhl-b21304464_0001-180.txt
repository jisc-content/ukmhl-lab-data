The disease is often limited to the spine, which, becoming crook- ed, generally acquires a second curvature, and in an opposite direction. When the cervical vertebriE become crooked, the head falls back, and seems sunk between the shoulders. When the disease appears during infancy, the bones of the pelvis are frequently distorted, the sacrum approaching the pubis. The thigh-bones are bent forwards, and the neck of the thigh-bone, instead of being oblique in respect to the shaft of the bone, forms a right angle with it, and the ends of the bones are en- larged. The bones of the leg are bent in a similar man- ner with the thigh-bone. It may be proper to add, that the bones of some rickety children contain so very little earth, that when steeped in water for some time, they are re- solved into a pulpy matter ; and they shrink by drying, very considerably, both in length and thick- -ness. When, on the other hand, the bones from rickets have attained an unnatural thickness, then, though snjter than naturaly they contain more earth than the same bone in its healthy state, a> has been clearly proved by the very accurate chemical ana- lyses of Mr John Davy.

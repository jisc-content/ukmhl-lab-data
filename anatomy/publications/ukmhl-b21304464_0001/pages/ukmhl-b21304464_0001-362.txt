334 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. distinguished from the pterygoid process by a per- pendicular fossa, which, applied to such another in the maxillary bone, forms a passage for the pa- latine branch of the fifth pair of nerves; and by another small hole behind this, through which a twig of the same nerve passes. The pterygoid process is somewhat triangular, having a broad base, and ending smaller above. The back-part of this process has three fossae for- med in it; the two lateral receive the ends of the two plates of the sphenoid bone, that are com- monly compared to a batâ€™s wing; the middle fossa makes up part of what is commonly called the fossa pterygoidea; the fore-side of this palatine pterygoid process is an irregular concave, where it receives the back-part of the great tuberosity of the maxillary bone. Frequently several small holes may be observed in this triangular process, particularly one near the middle of its base, which a little above communicates with the common and proper holes of this bone already taken no- tice of. The nasal lamella of this bone is extremely thin and brittle, and rises upwards from the upper side of the external edge of the square-bone, and from the narrow extremity of the pterygoid process; where it is so weak, and, at the same time, so firmly fixed to the maxillary bone, as to be very liable to be broken, in separating the bones. Frorn the part where this plate rises, it runs up broad on the inside of the tuberosity of the max-

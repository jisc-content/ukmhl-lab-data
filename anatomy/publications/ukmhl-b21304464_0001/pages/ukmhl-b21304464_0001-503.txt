IIGAMENTS OF SUPERIOR EXTREMITIES. 475 This ligament is perforated in several places by bloodvessels, and there is a large opening at the upper part of it, which is filled by muscles. This ligament not only binds together the ra- dius and ulna, and limits the rotation of the ra- dius, but also gives origin to many muscular fibres. There is a capsular ligament which incloses the carpal end of the ulna, which arises from the edges of the semilunar cavity at the carpal end of the ulna. Sect. IV. LIGAMENTS BETWEEN THE FORE-ARM AND WRIST. There is a capsular ligament extending be- tween the margin of the glenoid cavity of the radius, and the cartilaginous edges of the os sca- phoides, lunare, and cunelforme. There are two lateral ligaments, one placed between the styloid process of the radius, and the os naviculare, and the other, between the styloid process of the ulna, and the cuneiform and pisiform bones. There is also an internal mucous ligament withr in the joint, which extends between the two first bones of the carpus, and the radius.

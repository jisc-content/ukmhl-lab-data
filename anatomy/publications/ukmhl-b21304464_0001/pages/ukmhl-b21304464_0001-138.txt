OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 110 In all these instances, one reason of the diminu- tion of force is, that the oblique muscles are long- er, and therefore have fewer fibres than straight ones supposed to* fill the same space; and the other reason is, that a muscle loses force by pull- ing obliquely, in the proportion which its length bears to the length of the sine of the angle which it forms with an horizontal line, or to the length of a perpendicular joining two horizontal lines which pass through the origin and insertion of the muscle. Thus, if an oblique muscle deviates one half of a right angle from the perpendicular, it loses the one half exactly of its strength. Thus, in Plate 3. fig. 1. let AB, BC, represent a log of wood ; DD a hook in the roof of a room. Let DB DB represent two straight muscles, ex- erting their whole force in elevating the log ABBC, but the two oblique muscles DA and DC expend but one-half of their force in elevating the log; for the other half of their force is spent in endeavouring to draw the ends of the log to- wards each other. That is, the two straight muscles elevate the log with twice as much force as the two oblique muscles do. In other cases the force increases or diminishes according to the obliquity, by the general rule above stated. Thus, the two muscles DE and DF raise the log with one-fourth only of the force of the two muscles DB and DB. To prove this experimentally, let two pullies A and B, (See Plate 3. fig. 2.) be fixed very near

Its inside has a flat conoidal surface, where it is contiguous to the preceding bone. When we stand, the. fore ends of these meta- tarsal bones, and the os calcis, are our only sup- porters ; and therefore it is necessary they should be strong, and should have a confined motion. Of the Toes. The bones of the Toes are much a-kin to those of the thumb and fingers: Particularly the two of the great toe are precisely formed as the two of the thumb ; only their position, in respect of the other toes, is not oblique ; and they are proportionally much stronger, because they are subjected to a greater force *, for they sustain the force with which our bodies are pushed for- wards by the foot behind at every step we make ; and on them principally the weight of the body is supported, when we are raised on our tip- toes.

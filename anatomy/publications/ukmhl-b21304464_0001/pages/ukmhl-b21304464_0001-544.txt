The sesamoid bones at the first joint of the great toe are much larger than any other, are early form- ed, and are seldom wanting in an adult. These bones, by increasing the angle of insertion of the tendons of the flexor muscles, add considerably to the force of these muscles; and they may possibly tend to prevent the above tendons from being com- pressed by the weight of the body *. * That the sesamoid bones are not formed in consequence of pressure, is evident, as in the foetus a few months after con- ception, there are cartilages of a similar figure as the sesamoid bones.

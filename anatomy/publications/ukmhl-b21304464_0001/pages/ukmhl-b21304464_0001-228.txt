200 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. The superior oblique processes of this mrtebra dtntata are large, circular, very nearly in an ho- rizontal position, and slightly convex, to be adapt- ted to the inferior oblique processes of the first vertebra. The inferior oblique processes of this vertebra dentata answer exactly to the description given of those common to all the cervical vertebrae. The tranverse processes of the vertebra dentata are short, very little hollowed at their upper part, and not forked at their ends; and the canals through which the cervical arteries pass, are re- flected outwards about the middle substance of each process; so that the course of these vessels may be directed towards the transverse pro- cesses of the first vertebra. Had this curvature of the arteries been made in a part so moveable as the neck is, while they were not defended by a bone, and fixed to that bone, scarcely a motion could have been performed without the utmost hazard of compression, and a stop put to the course of the liquids, with all its train of bad consequen- â€¢ ces. Hence we observe this same mechanism se- veral times made use of, when there is any occa- sion for a sudden curvature of a large artery, as when the carotids pass through the bones; or when the vertebral arteries, turning round the oblique processes of the first vertebra, reach the great hole of the occipital bone. The spinal process of this vertebra is thick, .strong, and short, to give sufficient origin to

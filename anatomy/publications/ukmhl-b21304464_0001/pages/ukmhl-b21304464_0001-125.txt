97 MYOLOGY; There are immense numbers of stimuli which produce: the contraction of muscles, of which the nervous energy is certainly the chief. The integrity of the werw and artery leading to a muscle w essential to its action; for a ligature thrown around that nerve, or the dividing it, renders the muscle paralytic, or incapable of action ; and fur- ther, the cause of this palsy is generally resident in the brain and spinal marrow, from whence the nerve originates, and not in the part affected. Relaxation of Muscles. Until the causes of contraction are fully under- stood, those which induce relaxation of the muscles must be obscure. Contraction and relaxation take place regularly, and constantly and alternately in the heart, as the circulation could not otherwise have been proper- ly carried on ; and even after the heart is sepa- rated from 'the body, when its most common and principal stimulus the blood is wanting. During respiration, contraction and relaxation alternately take place, but less regularly, for a great number of useful purposes.

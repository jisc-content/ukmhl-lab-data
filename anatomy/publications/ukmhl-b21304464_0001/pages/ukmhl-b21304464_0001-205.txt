177 J9ISEASES OF BONES. Explanation of Plate Ath. This plate is intended’to communicate to the reader an idea of the manner in which ossification is carried on in the patellae of children: The arteries (called by Mr John Hunter Labouring) are of large size, and were filled by red blood, and in the act of secreting bone, and which takes place in some children sooner than in others. Explanation of Plate 5th. t This engraving gives a view of the manner in which the arteries of the muscles anastomose together. Fig. 1. represents the portion of the muscle, as seen by the naked eye; and fig. 2. represents a magnified view of the same portion of muscle. / Explanation of Plate 6th. This etching, which has been for thirty years in my father’s cabinet, represents rather more than one-half of an exostosis, which grew from one of the metacarpal bones of the fingers; it is very irregular on its surface, and quite different in structure from the bone from which it grew. ABC represents the metacarpal bone, which was very much bent. DDDD, the knobby surface of the tumour. EE point out the bony plates, which pass from one side of the tumour to the other, and in the interstices, there was a gristly matter, and a quantity of ill-condiii tinned putrid sanies. ^ t VOL. I.

OSTEOLOGY. 43 ferences were in some cases too hastily drawn, and that farther investigation of the subject is neces- sary.‚Äù Periosteum. All the bones, except the boides of the teeth, are covered by a membrane, named on that ac- count PERIOSTEUM *. The periosteum can be divided into layers of fibres. The exterior ones, composed of the fibres of the muscles connected to the bones, vary in their number, size, and direction, and consequent- ly occasion a very great difference in the thickness and strength of the periosteum of different bones, and even of the different parts of the same bone. The internal layer is every where nearly of a si- milar structure, and its fibres follow the same di- rection with those of the bone to which they are contiguous. Ought not then the name periosteum to be applied, strictly speaking, only to this inter- nal layer, to which the others are joined in an un- certain manner and number ? Except where muscles, cartilages, or ligaments are inserted into the periosteum, its external sur- face is connected to the surrounding parts by thin cellular membranes, which can easily be stretched considerably, but shorten themselves whenever the stretching force is removed. When we attempt to tear off the periosteum from bones, we see a great number of white threads * Mcmbrana circumo.^salis, omentum ossibus impositum.

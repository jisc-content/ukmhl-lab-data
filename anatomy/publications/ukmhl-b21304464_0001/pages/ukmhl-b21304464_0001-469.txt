441 OF THE METACARPUS. ly resist bodies pressed against them by the thumb, or fingers, or both. The Os metacarpi digiti annularis is shorter than the second metacarpal bone. Its base is semi- circular and convex, for its conjunction with the os unciforme. On its internal side are two smooth convexities, and a middle fossa, adapted to the se- cond metacarpal bone. The external side has a triangular smooth concave surface to join it with the fourth one. The anterior ridge of its body is situated more to the out than to the inside. The tubercles near the head are equal. The mo- tion of this third metacarpal bone is greater than the motion of the second. The Os metacarpi minimi digiti is the smallest and sharpest. Its base is irregularly convex, and rises slanting outwards. Its internal side is exactly adapted to the third metacarpal bone. The ex- ternal has no smooth surface, because it is not con- tiguous to any other bone; but it is prominent where the extensor carpi ulnaris is inserted. As this metacarpal bone is furnished with a proper moving muscle, has the plainest articulation, is most loosely connected and least confined, it not only enjoys a much larger motion than any of the rest, but draws the third bone with it, when the palm of the hand is to be made hollow by its ad- vancement forwards, and by the prominence of the thumb opposite to it. There are two bones in the thumb, and three in CJlch of the fingers.

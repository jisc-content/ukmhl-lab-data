DISEASES OF THE BONES. 161 • Vid. Plate 14. osteum; in the latter, the muscles and skin are injured. Sometimes bones are broken in several places *. Fractures are sometimes incomplete ^ and these rarely occur but in the young. The surfaces of the pieces of the fractured bone touch each other generally, as, where another bone serves to support the broken bone ; the fibula, for instance, retains pieces of the broken tibia, in im- mediate contact. • Sometimes the fractured pieces of bone touch each other only parUally; as, from the foot being turned round when the tibia has been fractured, the outer part of the circumference of the under piece of the broken bone may be applied to the inner part of the circumference of the upper piece. If the muscles be fixed to both pieces of the broken bone, these are not disunited; but if they are only attached to one of these, as in fracture at the neck of the humerus, the teres major and la- tissimus dorsi draw the under portion upwards and backwards. If the neck of the thigh-bone be broken, the upper piece having no muscle fixed into it, the muscles fixed to the under and larger piece draw it upwards, so that the limb loses one or two inches* of its length.

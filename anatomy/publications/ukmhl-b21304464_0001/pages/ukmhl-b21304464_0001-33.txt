6 GENERAL OBSERVATIONS. Angiolocy, Of the structure and course of the Blood- vessels. Neurology, Of the Nerves. It is not easy to detect the chemical ingre- dients which enter into the composition of the body; 1. As new compounds are formed during the processes instituted for that purpose. 2. As many of the constituent principles are apt to escape in a gaseous state, or to elude obser- vation. According to the present state of Animal Che- mistry, Carbon, Azote, Hydrogen, Oxygen, Sul- phur, and a small proportion of Iron, are supposed to form the constituent elements of the animal body, producing Jelly, Albumen, and Fibrina.

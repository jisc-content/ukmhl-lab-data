OF THE STERNUM. 253 Two or three other very small bony points are likewise to be seen in several children. The number of bones increases for some years, and then diminishes but uncertainly, till they are at last united into those above described of an adult. This bone gives origin and insertion to several muscles ; sustains the mediastinum, defends the heart and lungs, at the fore-part; and, lastly, by serving as a moveable fulcrum of the ribs, assists â€¢ considerably in respiration. When the ribs that are connected by their car- tilages to the sternum, or to the cartilages of the true ribs, are acted upon by the intercostal muscles, they must all be pulled from the oblique position which their cartilages kept them in, nearer to right angles with the vertebrae and sternum, be- cause the first or uppermost rib is by much the most fixed of any ; and the cartilages making a great resistance to raising the anterior ends of the ribs, their large arched middle parts turn outwards as well as upwards. The sternum, pressed strongly on both sides by the cartilages of the ribs, is pushed forwards, and that at its several parts, in proportion to the length and mcjtion of its supporters, the ribs ; that is, most at its lower end. The sternum and the car- tilages, thus raised forwards, must dra\f^ the dia- phragm connected to them ; consequently so far stretch it, and bring it nearer to a plane.

OUTLINES OF ANATOMY.' 155 and other serotis membranes, and consequently sub- ject to the same organic derangements *. The membranes of the bursee are united to the neighbouring parts by the common cellular mem- brane, and where situated in the vicinity of the bones, a thin layer'of cartilage is interposed bcr tween the bursa and the bone. The membrane of the bursa is internally remark- ably smooth, and lubricated by a fluid in all respects ^similar f to synovia, and there are very small masses of fat within the bursa, with fringes appended to them, which are covered by the continuation of the membrane of the bursa, and upon which the smaller ramifications of the arteries are distributed in considerable number, which thereby commu- nicate to it a pale red colour.

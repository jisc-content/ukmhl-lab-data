OSTEOLOGY. So found all of them similarly acted on. They effer- vesced slightly j yielded a cartilaginous residue, and their solutions afforded a precipitate with am- monia. The only apparent difference was in re- spect to the degree of effervescence. The reticu- lar bones effervesced more briskly than the firm and compact ones. But this appeared to be prin- cipally owing to the ‘greater extent of surface ex- posed to the acid by the former, than by the lat- ter ; for I obtained from 50 grains of the rickety parietal bpne 2 grains of carbonate of lime, just the proportion found by Mr Pepys in human teeth. “ I have only attempted to ascertain the pro- portions of earth and of animal matter. To effect this, I exposed a certain quantity of each bone se- parately, in an open crucible, to a red heat, till it was rendered white, or perfectly free from car- bonaceous matter, internally as well as externally. For the sake of greater accuracy, the pieces of bones made the subjects of experiment were loose- ly wrapped up in a thin sheet of platina. Thus the admixture of dust from the fire was excluded. “ I shall give the results in the following tables;—

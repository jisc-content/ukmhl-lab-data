442 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. Of the Thumb. The Thumb* is situated obliquely in respect of the fingers, neither directly opposite to them, nor in the same plane with them. Its bones are much thicker and stronger in proportion to their length, than the bones of the fingers are: Which was extremely necessary, since the thumb counteracts all the fingers. The frst bone\ of the thumb has its base adapt- ed to the double pulley of the trapezium : For, in viewing it from one side to the other, it appears convex in the middle ; but when considered from behind forwards, it is concave there. The edge at the fore-part of this base is produced farther than any other part; and round the back-part of the base, a rough fossa may be seen, for the con- nexion of the ligaments of this joint. The body and head of this bone are of the same shape as the ossa metacarpi; only that the body is shorter, and the head flatter, with the tubercles at the fore- part of its root larger. The articulation of the upper end of this bone is uncommon: For though it has protuberances , and depressions adapted to the double pulley of the trapezium; yet it enjoys a circular motion, * AÂ»T<;^i({ magnus digitus, promanus. + Prinium interuodium, or metacarpal bone of tbe tlnimb.

The Tibia *, so called from its resemblance to an old musical pipe or flute, is a long thick tri- angular bone, situated at the internal part of the leg, and continued in almost a straight line from the thigh-bone. The upper end of the tibia is large, bulbous, and spongy, and is divided into two cavities, .by a rough irregular protuberance f, which is hollow at its most prominent part, as well as before and behind. The anterior of the crucial ligaments is. inserted into the middle cavity, and the depression behind receives the posterior ligament. The two broad cavities at the sides of this pro- tuberance are not equal; for the internal is ob- long and deep, to receive the internal condyle of the thigh-bone; while the external is more su- perficial and rounder, for the external condyle. In each of those two cavities of a recent subject, a semilunar cartilage is placed, which is thick at its convex edge, and becomes gradually thinner towards the concave or interior edge. * ng<wtvi)(ttÂ«)v, IruKtitfAtoi, focile majus, arundo major, canna major, canna domestica cruris.

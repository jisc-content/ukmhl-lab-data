S9 OSTEOLOGY. <Iestruction and exfoliation of the external layers of tlje bone, and in others by a new growth of bone, which includes the original bone which has been reduced to a gangrenous state, and is cast off; and also from the phenomena observed during the growth of horns. My Father entertained a favourable opinion of Du Hamel’s theory, and thus expressed himself in his Lectures: “ The periosteum has a greater effect in re- pairing the loss of bones from accident than Du Hamel himself is aware of. For, from his argu- ments, and from a number of additional circum- stances, it appears, that the supply is very much made by the periosteum, though not entirely so, for the vessels of bones can furnish a matter that is similar to the rest. We find, on breaking the bones of animals, and tracing the fracture, that at first the periosteum around the bone inflames, and swells enormously, beyond what you would ima- gine, especially if the animal is young. I have seen it one-fourth of an inch in thickness in a pig after a fracture. With time, that is, in the space of a fortnight or three weeks, we find new earthy matter beginning to be deposited. “ Now, some, as Haller, have alleged, that in- deed the periosteum swells after a fracture, be- cause it has a certain degree of irritability, but • that the swelling subsides again, without pro-r ducing bone.

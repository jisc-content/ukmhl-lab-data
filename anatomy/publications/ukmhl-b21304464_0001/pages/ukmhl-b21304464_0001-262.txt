OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 234 tues of antiquity, Dr Camper informs us, he had remarked the following proportions : In'the Farnese Hercules, the breadth, compared with the depth, is as 12 to. 8^. In the Pythioti Jpollo, it is as 9 to 7. In the Antinous, it is as 11|- to 8^. And in the Venus de Medicis, as II to 8^. The pelvis is different as to the'proportions of its parts in different women. The pelvis has been divided into three parts, viz. the brim or introitus, the cavitas, and the inferior aperture or exitus. In the standard pel- vis, a line drawn from the sacrum to the os pubis, measures rather more than 4 inches, from one os ilium to the other, 5 inches and 5 ; and in the lower part or inferior aperture of the pelvis, these proportions are reversed ; for a line from the sym- physis pubis, to the os coccygis, allowing an inch for the retraction of that bone, is equal to 5 inches. . In the standard pelvis, the pelvis is about 3^ inches at the sides, 6 inches behind, and about inch before. When a pelvis exceeds the above dimensions, it has been called too large, and when less, it is said to-be too small. The pelvis may be symmetrical, and at the same time too small, owing to its component bones not being sufficiently expanded, or it may be too small-ill consequence off a general or partial dis- tortion of its bones, the effect of mollities ossium.

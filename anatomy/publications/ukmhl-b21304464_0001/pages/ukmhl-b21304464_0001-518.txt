The posterior side has two lateral grooves, and a small middle protuberance. In the internal de- pression, the tendons of the musculus tibialis pos- ticus and flexor digitorum longus are lodged ; and in the external, the tendon of the flexor longus pollicis plays. From the middle protuberance, ligamentous sheaths go out, for tying down these tendons. The articulations and motions of the tibia shall be explained, after all the three bones of the leg are described. Both the ends of the tibia are cartilages at the birth, and become afterwards epiphyses. Of the Fibula.

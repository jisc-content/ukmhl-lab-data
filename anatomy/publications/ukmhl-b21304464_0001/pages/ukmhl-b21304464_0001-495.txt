467 INTER09SEI MUSCLES, Of the Muscles between the Fingers, called Meta- carpo-Phalangei Laterales, or Interossei. There are two strata of interossei muscles, an extemaJ and internal. These muscles take their origin from the sides of the metacarpal bones, and ,are fixed by slender tendons, into the tendinous expansions of the ex- tensor digltorum communis. By these muscles, the fingers are moved lateral- ly, and they also assist in beading or extending the phalanges of the fingers. There are four interossei inte?'m in the palm of the hand. The 1st, called prior indicis, takes its origin from the outer part of the metacarpal bone of the fore-fingers, and is inserted into the outer side of the first phalanx of that finger. By this muscle, the fore-finger is drawn towards the thumb. The 2d, named posterior indicis, arises from the root and inner side of the metacarpal bone of the fore-finger, and is inserted into the inner side of the first phalanx of the fore-finger. By this muscle, that finger is drawn outwards. The 3d, named prior annularis, arises from the â€¢root and outer side of the metacarpal bone of the ring-finger, and is inserted into the outer side of the first phalanx of the same finger. GgS

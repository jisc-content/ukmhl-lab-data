OSTEOLOGY. 41 This method of forming the estimate, though not perfectly accurate, is yet certainly near the truth, and apparently well adapted for comparative pur- poses. “ The results contained in the different tables vary so much, that they scarcely admit of any ge- neral conclusions to be drawn from them. “ Between the diseased bones there is the great- est difference of the proportions of the constituent parts. Some of the bones marked rickety, con- tain more, and some less, earth, than the same bones in their healthy state,—an additional proof, if fur- ther proof was wanting, that a deficiency of phos- phate of lime is not an essential, but merely an adventitious circumstance in rickets. “ The results of the 1st Table shew, that the proportions of earth and of animal matter vary in different healthy bones of the same person, and in the similar bones of different persons ; that in old age, the phosphate of lime apparently increases in quantity in the occipital, and diminishes in the jaw bones; that the composition of the sequestra is much the same as that of sound bones ; and it further ap- pears from these results,that the hardness of bones in general is not always proportional to the quantity of earth present, though in the same skeleton this probably is the case ; and lastly, the concordance of composition of two Negro skulls, both remarkably hard and white, renders it probable that the bones of Africans will be found to contain a larger pro-

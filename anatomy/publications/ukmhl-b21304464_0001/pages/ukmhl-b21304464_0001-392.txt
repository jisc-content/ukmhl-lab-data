OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. * Vid. Plate ixi. In proof of which, the head of one of my pa- tients, though it had attained a large siz,e before birth, increased six inches in circumference in the course of nine months; and, in another instance, the child, when nine months old, required a hat fit for a child four years old. . As the skull after puberty rarely gives way, the brain must be much compressed ; which compres- sion speedily leads to stupor,. convulsions, and death, or to the hydrocephalus acutus. The form of the skull of the foetus is very diffe- rent from that of the adult; in the former, the skull projects remarkably at the original centres of ossification of its component pieces*, and hence the the upper part of the skull of the foetus is not so round as that of the adult. In the adult, those prominences which are very apparent in the foetus disappear, owing to the gra- dual growth and alteration of the shape of the brain, which serves as a mould on which the skull is formed ; the skull adapting itself to the form of the brain. But as, in consequence of hydrocephalus, the growth of the brain is checked, or in some mea- sure suspended, the brain does not acquire its usual form ; and as the brain is pushed outwards from the accumulation of water within it, the bones of the cranium, though they increase in size, retain the form they had when the child was

OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. so agitated, but does not when care is taken to pre- vent air being entangled by its parts. “ Its chemical properties are not so similar to those of the white of an egg as its physical ones. It readily mixes with water. Heat renders it tur- bid, and occasions the coagulation of a small pro- portion of albumen. Diluted acids render it cloudy in a slight degree ; but their effect is not equal to that of a boiling temperature. The latter not only produces an evident coagulation, but like- wise destroys the peculiar viscidity of the fluid, which the acids do not affect. The sulphuric, muriatic and nitric acids, in their concentrated state, first occasion a slight coagulation, and in a short time a perfect solution of the synovia, and a destruction of its viscidity. The sulphuric solution was of a light brownish yellow ; the ni- tric of a light wine yellow ; and the muriatic so- lution was colourless. Ammonia and potash ap- peared to have little effect on it. Corrosive sub- limate, infusion of nut-galls, and acetitc of lead, each produced a precipitate, and deprived the sy- novia of its viscidity. The precipitate by acetite of lead apparently exceeded in quantity that by corrosive sublimate, but was less than that which infusion of nut-galls afforded. “ From these results, synovia seems to contain albumen, gelatin and mucilage; and it also con- tains common salt, a small proportion of free aD kali, and slight traces of phosphat of lime.

OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 380 distance from before to behind, was, by the callipers, eight inches and three quarters ; and the upper part of the skull forms an arch, of which the middle of the os frontis constitutes one extremity, and the most prominent part of the os occipitis, the other. From the most pro- minent or highest part of the arch, near the middle of the sagittal suture, to the fore-part of the foramen magnum ossis occipitis, the distance was 5| inches, being little more than ^th of an inch greater than in most skulls: hence it appears that the pressure applied to the sides of this skull, had added very little to its depth. Such a remarkable deviation from the natural form of the skull, and a form which is so different from the skulls of other mummies, which have been carefully ex- amined by Blumenbach, Middleton, 8ic. could only, in my opinion, have been the effect of lateral pressure arti- ficially applied. Explanation of Plate ^Oth A. This plate represents the under-part of the skull of the Carib, in order to shew how much it has been dis- torted, probably also by pressure artificially applied. This plate also represents the Craniometer applied. ABCD, the diff erent sides of the instrument, which are divided into inches and half inches. E, the nonius applied. FFFF, threads stretched from the opposite sides of the craniometer. G, points out its occiput. H, the alveolar processes of the' skull. I, the foramen magnum ossis occipitis. KK, the occipital condyles. L, the cuneiform process of the os occipitis. M, the palatine plate of the os maxillare superius. â€˜ N, the zygoma.

248 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. Sternwn. The sternum *, or breast-bone, which varies con- siderably as to breadth in different persons, is the broad flat bone, or pile of bones, atâ€™ the fore-part of the thorax. In adults of a middle age, it is com- posed of three bones, which easily separate after the cartilages connecting them are destroyed. Fre- quently the two lower bones are found intimately united ; and very often in old people, the sternum is a continued bony substance from one end to the other ; though we still observe two, sometimes three, transverse lines on its surface ; which are marks of the former divisions. The sternum is broadest and thickest above, and becomes smaller as it descends. The inter- nal surface of this bone is somewhat hollowed for enlarging the thorax ; but the convexity on the external surface is not so conspicuous, because the sides are pressed outwards by the true ribs ; the round heads of whose cartilages are received into seven smooth pits, formed in each side of the ster- num, and are kept firm there by strong ligaments,, which on the external surface have a particular radiated texture f. Frequently the cartilaginous fibres thrust themselves into the bony substance * EtSSt)?, Os Pectoris, ensiforme, scutum cordis. + Ruysch, Catalog. Rar. fig. 9-

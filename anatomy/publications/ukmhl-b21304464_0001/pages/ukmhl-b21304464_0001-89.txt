OSTEOLOGY. t)l Â« The sides do swell, from the irritation and in- flammation j but there are first a number of ves- sels shooting from the pericranium, or dura mater, (which is the pericranium within the skull), and from the extremity of these a plug is formed like a cork, which plugs up the hole My relation Dr Macdonald, who was a pupil of my Father, and heard him make the above obser- vations, also made a number of very ingenious ex- periments, from which he has drawn the follow- ing inferences; Primo, vidimus ossis fracti extrema periosteo destitLita, per spatium quo se invicem transihant, aspera, et primo stadio obducta sanguine coagu- late, qui, partim ex periosteo dilacerato, partim ex cavo meduUari, effusus videbatur. Ultra partem, qua extrema se invicem transibant, periosteum in- flammatum ac densum reperimus, cui subjacebat materia gelatinosa effusa, cum sanguine coagulate, quocum extrema fracti ossis erant obducta, co- alescens. Quod quidem notatu dignissimum est, coagulatus sanguis, quo longius a fracta ossis parte distabat, etquodiutius post experimentum inspexi, CO languidius ruber erat, eoque magis in album inclinavit. * This quotation is talcen from a manuscript copy of my Fa- ther's Lectures, which was originally written by Mr Thoubuhn, who was his pupil in 1770. Many copies of this manuscript ar? in circulation.

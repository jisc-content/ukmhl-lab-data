OSTEOLOGY. SS We see marrow contained in the larger trans- verse and longitudinal canals, and thence judge that it passes also into the smaller ones. The drops of oil which we discover with a mi- croscope every where on the surface of a recent bone fractured transversely, and the ooxing of oil through the most solid bones of a skeleton, which renders them greasy and yellow, are a confirma- tion of the use of these canals. Most bones have also one or more large oblique canals formed through their sides for the passage of the medullary vessels. Chemical Analysis of Bones. The component parts of bone are Earth, Jelly, Cartilage, and Oil. These constituent principles may be separated in different ways,—by burning bones in a fire,— by acids,—and by boiling. By the aid of fire, the animal matter is driven off; and by the addition of acids, the earthy mat- ter is dissolved, and may be readily precipitated. The earthy matter contained in human bones consists of the Phosphate of Lime, of Carbonate of Lime, and of a very small proportion of the Sul- phate of Lime. In the bones of quadrupeds, a small proportion of the Phosphate of Magnesia has also been de- tected by Fourcroy and Vauquelin. VOL. I. C

404, OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. clavicle, has the cartilage above described, inter- posed betwixt it and the irregular cavity of the sternum. The ligaments which surround this articulation are short and strong, and admit of little motion any way; and the strong ligament that is stretched across the upper furcula of the sternum, from the posterior prominent angle of the one clavicle, to the same place of the other clavicle, serves to keep each of these bones more firmly in their place. By the assistance, however, of the moveable intervening cartilage, the cla- vicle can, at this joint, be raised or depressed, and moved backwards and forwards so much, as that the external end, which is at a great distance from that axis, enjoys very conspicuous motions. The articulation of the exterior end of the cla- vicle shall be considered after the description of the scapula. The clavicles keep the scapulae, and consequent- ly all the superior extremities, from falling in and forward upon the thorax ; by which, as in most quadrupeds, the motions of the arms would be much confined, and the breast made too narrow. The clavicles likewise afford origin to several muscles, and a defence to large vessels. From the situation, figure and use of the cla- vicles, it is evident, that they are much exposed to fractures; that their broken parts must gene- rally cross each other, and that they are difficult- ly kept in their place afterwards.

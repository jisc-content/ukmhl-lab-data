OUTLINES OF ANATOMY, 476 Sect. V. LIGAMENTS OF THE CARPUS. The ligaments called annular^ formed by the aponeurosis of the muscles, have been already de- scribed. There is a capsular ligament between the upper and under rows of bones which compose the car- pus, which is strengthened by a great number of short ligamentous fibres, which cross the capsular ligament in different directions, and have been called obliquCy ti'ansversCy and perpendicular liga- ments. Sect. VI. LIGAMENTS BETWEEN THE CARPAL AND META- CARPAL BONES. The second row of the carpal bones is united to the neighbouring bones by capsular ligaments; and there are various additional ligamentous fibres, which have been named obliquey or straight liga- ments, from the direction of their fibres.

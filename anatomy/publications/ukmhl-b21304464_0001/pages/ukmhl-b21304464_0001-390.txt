OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 362 I have described * two cases, which afford striking examples of the operation of posture and pressure in modifying the form of the head. In the former, from the boy sleeping most frequent- ly on his back, the back-part of the head on which he rests has become flat; and as, in the latter case, the child was suckled at one breast only, the pres- sure of the mother’s arm prevented the one side from bulging out so much as the other. I have endeavoured to shew that the brain serves as a mould*upon which the skull is formed ; and the following observations seem to me to afford still farther evidence in support of that opinion. It seems probable, that in the hydrocephalus chronicus, there is not the usual balance betwixt the actions of the arterial and absorbent systems. The arteries of the brain do not secrete the usual quantity of medullary matter, while the absorbent vessels, in consequence of distention and pressure, act much more powerfully than usual, and re- move a considerable portion of the brain. In many instances, on dissection, almost the whole substance of the brain has been found re- moved ; and its cavities have been so distended, that the brain itself seemed only a thin lining to the dura mater. In such a morbid state,•'the water contained within the ventricles will push the brain outwards, and separate the pieces of the cranium to a great- * Vid. Dr Duncan’s Annals of Medicine for 18Q3.

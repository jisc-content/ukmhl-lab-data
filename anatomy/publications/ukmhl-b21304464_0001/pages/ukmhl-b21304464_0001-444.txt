416 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. When the fore-arm is extended, the tendon of the interna^^rachiaeus niuscle is lodged in the fore- part of the cltvity of this pully. The external protuberance, which is less than the other, has a sharp edge behind ; but forwards, this ridge is ob- tuse, and separated from the little head, already described, only by a small fossa, in which the joined edges of the ulna and radius move. The internal protuberance of the pully is lafger and higher ; and therefore in the motions of the ulna upon it, that bone would be inclined out- wards, was it not supported by the radius on that side. Between this internal protuberance and condyle, a sinuosity may be remarked, where the ulnar nerve passes. The substance and the internal structure of the os humeri is the same, and ilisposed in the same way as in other long bones. The round head at the upper end of this bone is articulated with the glenoid cavity of the sca- pula ; 'which being superficial, and having long ligaments, allows the arm a free and extensive mo- tion. These ligaments are however considerably strong. For, besides the common capsular one,- the tendons of the muscles perform the office, and have been described under the name of ligaments. Then the acromion and coracoid process, with the strong broad ligaments stretched betwixt them, secure the articulation above, where the greatest

On account of the extreme thinness of the coats of the bursae mucosae, the anatomist cannot give ocular proof of nerves being distributed upon their coats, which has given rise to the opinion that the bursae mucosae are not supplied with nerves, which opinion, as the burss are endowed with little sen- sibility, has gained weight. But as an inflam- ' mation of the bursae occasions great pain, there ctm be no doubt oj their bein^ under the injlueuce of « nerves. * Authors upon the Bursce Mucoscb. Winslow, Exposit.

266 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. whereby the fibres of the internal side would be stretched farther out at the edges of the bones, than, the exterior ones, if they were not resisted. The resistances are the fibres of the opposite bone, the parts within the skull, and the diploe ; of which the last being the weakest, the most ad- vanced fibres or serrae run into it, and leave the contiguous edges equal, and more ready to unite : whereas the serrae of the external table have space enough for their admission between the fibres of the opposite bone *, and therefore remain of the indented form, and are less liable to the concre- tion, whereby the sutures are obliterated *. By this mechanism, there is no risk of the sharp points of the bones growing inwards, since the external serrae of each of the conjoined bones rest upon the internal smooth-edged table of the other ; and external forces applied to these parts are strongly resisted, because the sutures cannot yield, unless the serrated edged of the one bone, and the plain internal plate of the other are broken f. The advantages of the sutures of the cranium arc these: 1. That the bones which are at some di- stance from each other at birth, might then yield, and allow to the head a change of shape, accommodated to the passage it is engaged in.

53 MYOLOGY. eating the muscular fibres from the blood, fat, and cellular substance, with which they are very inti- mately involved. To Messrs Thouvenel, Fourcroy, Vauquelin and Hatchett, we are chiefly indebted for our knowledge of the chemical composition of the muscular fibre. A muscle, when washed, is converted into a white fibrous substance, which retains the form Df the muscle ; this consists chiefly, of fibrin, 2 of albumen, 3 of jelly, 4 of extractive, 5 of phosphate of soda ; and Mr Hatchett discovered in beef, phosphate of ammonia, and the phosphate and car- bonate of lime.

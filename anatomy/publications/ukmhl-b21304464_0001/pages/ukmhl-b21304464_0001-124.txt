OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 96 unnatural manner, or when their action is impeded, then we suffer very great distress. Under this class the sphincter muscles may per- haps be included ; they are not constantly, but only occasionally under the dominion of the will. The degree of contraction of muscles is very various : it has generally been said that muscles contract one third only of their length ; but many muscles, as those of the bladder of urine and the sphincter of the mouth, are capable contracting iZBO-thirds, if not more. Does a muscle increase in its density when it contracts, as was formerly supposed ? Dr Blank’s experiment on the tail of the eel seems to determine this question in the negative*. * " I took a glass flask, into which one half of a living eel was introduced. The mouth was immediately afterwards fused by a hlow-pipe, and drawn into a tube like the stem of a thermometer. The flask and tube were then filled with water, in order to see whether the motion of the ajiimal would make the fluid rise or fall. It had jieilher the one effect nor “ the other, though there were at times strong convulsions; and if tlie muscles had at any time occupied either more space or less than at another, a sensible fluctuation would have been produced, especially when the column of fluid was rendered « very fine, by the introduction of a steel-wire to irritate the parts. That part of the cel from the anus to the tail was made use of for this experiment, as the other division, con- taijiing the organs of respirati<sn and the air-bladder, might “ have occasioned a fallacy, from the expansion or condensation of an elastic fluid, by accidental changes of temperature or compression. This was repeated three times, with the same ■t‘ result. In one of the trials, the above-mentioned portion of

-504* OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. the astragalus ; And beyond this a narrow fossa seen, which divides it from two small concave smooth surfaces, that are joined to the fore-part of the astragalus. Behind the posterior of these smooth surfaces, which is the largest, a small si- nuosity is made by the tendon of the flexor digi- torum longus ; at the fore-part of which a small rough protuberance appears, that gives rise to the ' musculus extensor digitorum brevis. The external side of this bone is flat, with a su- perficial fossa running horizontally, in which the tendon of the musculus peronaeus longus is lod- ged. The internal side of the heel-bone is hol- lowed, for lodging the origin of the massa carnea Jac. Sylvii, and for the safe passage of tendons, nerves, and arteries. Under the side of the inter- nal smooth concavity, a particular groove is made by the tendon of the flexor pollicis longus; and from the thin protuberance on this internal side, the cartilaginous ligament that supports the astra- galus, goes out to the os naviculare *, on which li- gament, and on the edge of this bone to which it is fixed, the groove is formed for the tendon of the flexor digitorum profundus. The lower surface of this bone is pressed flat at the back-part, by the weight of our bodies ; and immediately before this plane, there are two tubercles, from the internal of which the muscu- lus abductor pollicis, flexor digitorum sublimis, fis also part of the aponeurosis plantaris, and of

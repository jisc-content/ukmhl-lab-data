659 APPENDIX* pounded and softened than those of a man; in whom the greater breadth, and muscular swelling of the parts, indicate his superior energy and strength : Her chest is more convex ; her breasts more elevated and rounded ; her abdomen more prominent; her loins longer, and her limbs proportionally shorter; her pelvis is much broader, being adapted to the containing and giving passage to her child; her limbs more rounded and more delicate; her thighs larger, the thigh-bones more distant from one an- other, and inclining inwards, with a rapid slope as they descend; her legs, instead of swelling abruptly at the calves, taper gradually downwards; her ankles are less marked, and more rounded; and her feet and hands smaller, dimpled, and more finely turned. It has been already noticed, that the skeleton deter- Â« mines the disposition and proportions of the body; and hence, as there exist so many distinctions in the outline of the softer parts of the male and female, there must be t corresponding differences between the skeletons of the sexes. The female skeleton is smaller in all its dimensions, as Avell as more slender in regard to the individual bones, than that of the male. Like that of the child, it is by no means so much impressed by the muscles, and the cavi- ties are not so deep; hence the greater smoothness and fewer angles of the female skeleton. The more remarkable differences in the female skeleton, may be traced, as might have been expected, in the trunk of the body, which may be compared to a pyramid, of which the pelvis forms the basis ; whilst in the male, the proportions are reversed, the shoulders being much broad- er, that part may be considered as the basis. The female chest is shorter, though deeper; more con- vex in front, and more distant from the pelvis, the loins being longer.

OUTLINES or ANATOMY. 310 W^ithin the skull, there are two sinuosities iia the internal part of each wing of the sphenoid, bone, for receiving the middle part of the brain. One between the transverse spinous processes, for lodging the part of the brain where the crura medullae oblongatae are. Immediately before the third or middle clinoid process, a single pit generally may be remarked, from which a fossa goes out on each side to the holes through which the optic nerves pass. The pit is formed by the conjoined optic nerves; and in the fossae these nerves are lodged, as they run divided within the skull. Between that third protuberance and the posterior clinoid process, the large pit for the glandula pituitaria may be remarked. This cavity, because of its resemblance to a turkish saddle, is always described under the name of sella turcica, or ephippium. On the sides of the posterior clinoid process a fossa may be remarked, that stretches upwards; then is continued forwards along the sides of the sella turcica, near to the anterior clinoid processes, where a pit on each side is made. These fossae point out the course of the two internal carotid arteries after they have enter- ed the skull. Besides all these, several other fossae may be observed, leading to the several holes, and imprinted by the nerves and bloodvessels. The holes on each side of the os sphenoides are six proper, and three common. The first is the round one immediately below the anterior clinoid processes, for the passage of the optic nerve, and

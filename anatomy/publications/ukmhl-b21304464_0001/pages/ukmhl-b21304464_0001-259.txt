OF THE ACETABULUM. S31' the thigh inwards; For if the.bony brims had been here continued, the neck of' the thigh-bone must' have struck upon them when the thighs were brought across each other; which, in a large strong motion this way, would have en- dangered the neck of the one bone, or brim of the other. Then the vessels which are distributed to the joint may safely enter at the sinuosity in the bot- tom of the breach; which being however larger than is necessary for that purpose, allows the sy- novial apparatus of the joint to escape below the ligament, when the head of the thigh-bone is in hazard of pressing too much upon it in the motions of the thigh outwards *. Besides this difference in the height of the brims, the acetabulum is otherwise unequal; For the lower internal part bf it is depressed below the cartilaginous surface of the upper part, and is not covered with carti- lage ; into the upper part of this particular depres- sion, where it is deepest and of a semilunar form, the ligament of the thigh-bone, commonly, though improperly, called the round one, is inserted; while in its more superficial lower part the large mucilaginous gland of this joint is lodged. The largest share of this separate depression is formed in the os ischium.

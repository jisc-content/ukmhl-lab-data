The anterior edge has a long furrow in it, where the middle car- tilage of the nose enters. The lower edge is firmly united to the nasal spines of the maxillary and palate bones. These edges of this bone are much thicker than its middle, which is as thin as the finest paper ; by which, and the firm union or connexion this bone has above and below, it can very seldom be separated entire, but in a child ; wherefore I shall examine all its parts of such a subject. Its situation is not always perpendicular, but often inclined and bended to one side, as well as the nasal plate of the ethmoid bone. The convexity of the vomer in one of the nos- trils has sometimes been mistaken for a polypus in the nose. The vomer is convex at its upper part, and then is straight, as it is extended downwards and for- wards where it is composed of two plates ; the edges of which have a great number of small pro- cesses, disposed somewhat like the teeth of a saw, but more irregularly, and several of them are re- flected back. Between these plates a deep fossa is left, which, so far as the top of the curvature, is wide, and has strong sides, for receiving the procesSus azygos of the sphenoid bone. Beyond the arch forwards,*the fossa is narrower and shal- lower gradually to the point of the bone, receiv- ing for some way the nasal lamella ethmoidea; which, after the ossification is complete, is so close-

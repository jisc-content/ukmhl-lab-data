186 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. iwem the nature of ligament and cartilage is inter- posed ; which seems to consist of concentrical cur- ved fibres, when it is cut horizontally ; but when it is divided perpendicularly, the fibres appear oblique and decussating eaich other *. The outer part of the intervertebral ligaments is the most solid and hard ; and they gradually become softer towards the centre. The external fibrous part of each is capable of being greatly extended ; and of being compressed into a very small space, while the middle fluid part is incom- pressible, or nearly so ; and the parts of this liga - ment between the circumference and centre ap- proach in their properties to either, in proportion to their more solid or more fluid texture. The middle point is therefore a jidcj'uni or pivot, on which the motion of a ball and socket may be made, with such a gradual yielding of the sub- stance of the ligament, in whatever direction our spines are moved, as saves the body from violent shocks, and their dangerous consequences f.— This ligamento-cartilaginous substance is firmly- fixed to the horizontal surfaces of the bodies of the vertebra, to connect them, in which it is as- * Blancard, Anat. reform, cap. 32.—Weitbreicht.

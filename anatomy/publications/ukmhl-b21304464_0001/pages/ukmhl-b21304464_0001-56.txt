These round bones having strong forces natural- ly applied to them, and being otherwise exposed to violent injuries, have need of a cylindrical figure to resist external pressure, and of a considerable quantity of oil to preserve them from becoming too brittle. Besides which, they are advantageously provid- ed with thick sides towards their middle, where the greatest forces are applied to injure them j while their hollowness increases their diameter, and consequently, their strength to resist forces ap- plied to break them transversely*. Thus, for in- stance, in estimating the proportional resistance of two cylindrical bones of unequal diameters, but consisting of an equal number of similar fibres uni- formly disposed round each, it is plain, 1. That the absolute force of these two bones is equal, because they consist of equal numbers of similar fibres. 2. That the absolute forces of all the fibres in each bone, have the same effect in resisting any power applied to bend and to break them, as if the sum of all their forces were united in the respective centres of the transverse sections, where the fractures are * Gidilei Mechanic, dialog. 2.

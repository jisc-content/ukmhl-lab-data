Id quod insuper ex ipsa autopsia magis adhuc confirmatur; quantum enini in Vivisectionibus inspiciendo assequi un- quam potui, fibrae carneae in musculi contractione, tan- quain a fibrillis transversis attractae, propius ad inviceni accedere; et non ipsae abbreviari, sed fibrillarum con- tractionem sequi videntur. “ Quod vero ob ligatiiram utrique fibrarum carnearum extremitati injectam, muscularis contractio cessat, fibra- que ipsa non uti alias in tumorem assurgit, uti a Cl. D. D. Willisio annotatum est, hoc propterea fieri existimo quod sanguinis, Spirituumque Animaliuni motus, per ligaturas injectas interrumpitur, quorum tamen inlluxus ad fibril'- larum contractionem necessarius est.” In the above chapter, the reader will observe that he describes a’ muscle as composed of Jlcshy Jibres, and of an almost infinite series of viemhranaceons Jibrillo’, (which last have been called by all modern anatomists, tlireads of the cellular substance.) He tells us, that hitherto it has been maintained by authors, that the contraction of a muscle is primarily per- formed by its fleshy fibres, but that, in his opinion, not the jleshy fibres, but the fibrils inserted transversely into the fleshy fibres, perform the chief part in muscular con- traction, and that the straight position of these fibres is fit for performing it. To which he adds, that the fibrils, when shortened, draw the jleshy fibres towards each other, so that it is probable that the contraction of muscles is per- formed by them, seeing that a contracted muscle is're- markably constricted and hardened, which can be no other way done than by the contraction of the fibrils; VOL.

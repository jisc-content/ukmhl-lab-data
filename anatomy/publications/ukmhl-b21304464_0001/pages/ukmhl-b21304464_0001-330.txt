OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 302 From the middle of the outer surface of the cribriform lamella, a thin solid plate is extended downwards and forwards, having tlie same com- mon base with the crista galli. Generally it is not exactly perpendicular, but is inclined to one side or other, and therefore divides the cavity of the nose unequally. Its inclination to one side, and flexure in the middle, is sometimes so great, that it fills up a large share of one of the nostrils, and has been mistaken for a polypus there. It is thin at its rise, and rather still thinner in its middle ; yet afterwards, towards its lower edge, it becomes thicker, that its conjunction with the bones and middle cartilage of the nose might be firmer. At a little distance from each side of this ex- ternal process, a cellular and spongy bony sub- stance depends from the cribriform plate. The number and figure of the cells in this irregu- lar process of each side, are very uncertain, and not to be represented in words ; only the cells open into each other, and into the cavity of the nose: The uppermost, which are below the aperture of the frontal sinuses, are formed like funnels. The outer surface of these cells is smooth and plain, where this bone assists in composing the orbit; at which place, on each side, it has got the name of os planum ; on the upper edge of which.

The cancerous and vene- real ; but there are others which remain station- ary for years, and indeed the ivory exostoses have never been observed to pass on to the state of ca- ries. Abscess and Caries of J^ones. f Abscess sometimes gives rise to caries, and is the result of wounds, of fractures, lues venerea, cancer *, and scrofula. Exostoses frequently degenerate into caries, and the exostoses are in many instances in the first place destroyed. Ulcers of the bones bear a strong resemblance to those of the softer organs, from the effect of the same organic derangement, and occur generally in the most’spongy bones, as the *certebrce, bones of the tarsus, and ea'ti'emities of the long bones. The ill-conditioned fetid matter, the conco- mitant of caries of the bones, generally makes its way outwardly, at small fistulous orifices, and these are filled by fungous flesh, which bleeds when slightly touched. When carious bones are probed, they commu- nicate a gritty sensation, and are sometimes so soft that the probe sticks in them. When a caries of a joint has existed for a long time, an external suppuration generally takes place,

Thus'â€™ the skull is firmly fixed on the point of support, in the erect posture ; whereas, in most quadrupeds, the foramen magnum occipitis, is placed at the back of the head *, or the head is connected to the neck, by its back-part, instead of the middle of its basis, and hangs, as it were, before the neck ; by which quadrupeds, when in the horizontal posture, can seize what is before or above them, and, by depressing the head and neck, can reach the ground with the mouth. Of the size and form of the Head. The cavity of the cranium is proportioned to its tontents; and hence there is much variety as to the size of the head, and also as to its form in dif- ferent subjects. It is neither so broad, nor so deep at its fore-part, in which the fore-part of the brain is lodged, as at its back-part in which the back- part of the brain and smaller brain are lodged. The skull, generally speaking, is somewhat like an egg in its shape, with the broad end behind ; but there is much variety even among the indi- viduals of the same nation, as to this circumstance, of which Plate xvi affords very strong evidence. The greatest diameter of the cranium, is from the fore-head to the hind-head, and is equal to somewhat more than six inches, and the greatest

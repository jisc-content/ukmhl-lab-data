445 OF THE THUMB. This bone is in the sanje condition with the for- mer in children. ^ The third bone differs nothing from the descrip- tion of the second bone of the thumb, excepting in the general distinguishing marks ; and therefore the second and third phalanx of the fingers enjoy only flexion and extension. The upper end of this third phalanx, is a car- tilage in a ripe child; and is only an epiphyse after, till the full growth of the body. The phalanges of the several fingers differ only as to magnitude. The bones of the middle finger being the longest and largest, those of the fore- finger come next to that in thickness, but not in length, for those of the ring-finger are a little longer. The little-finger has the smallest bones. Which disposition is the best contrivance for holding the largest bodies; because the longest fingers are applied to the middle largest peri- phery of such substances as are of a spherical figure *. Lest I should seem to have forgot the small bones at the joints of the hand, I desire now to re- fer to the description of them, under the common title of sesamoid, bones, which I have placed after the bones of the feet. * Galen de usu part. lib. 1. cap. 24.

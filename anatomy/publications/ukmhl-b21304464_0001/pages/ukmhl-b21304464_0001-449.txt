OF THE ULNA. m On the outside of that we observe a smooth con- cavity, where the flexor digitorum profundus takes its origin. The body of the ulna is triangular. The internal angle is very sharp where the li- gament that connects the two bones is fixed r The sides which make this angle, are flat and rough, by the action and adhesion of the many muscles which are situated here. At the distance of one third of the length of the ulna from the top, in its fore-part, the passage of the medullary vessels is to be remarked slanting upwards. The external side of this bone is smooth, some- what convex, and the angles at each edge of it are blunted by the pressure of the muscles equally dis- posed about them. As this bone descends, it becomes gradually smaller; so that its lower end terminates in a little head, standing on a small neck. Towards the fore but outer part of which last, an oblique ridge runs, that gives rise to the pro- nator radii quadratus. The head is round, smooth, and covered with a cartilage on its internal side, to be received into the semilunar cavity of the radius ; while a styloid process * rises from its outside, 'to which is fixed a strong ligament that is extended to the os cu- neiforme and pisiforme of the wrist. * malleolus extemus.

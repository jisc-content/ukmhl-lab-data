444 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. bones, named phalanges *. All of them have ■half round convex surfaces, covered with an aponeurosis, formed by the tendons of the exten- sors, lumhricales, and interossei, and placed direct- ly backwards, for their greater strength, and their flat concave part is forwards, for taking hold more surely, and for lodging the tendons of the flexor muscles. The ligaments for keeping down these tendons are fixed to the angles that are between the convex and concave sides. - The bones of the first phalanx of the fingers, answer to the description of the second bone of the thumb : only that the cavity in their base is ‘not so oblong ; nor is their motion on the meta- carpal bones so much confined ; for they can be moved laterally or circularly, but have no rota- tion or a very small degree of it round their axis. Both the ends of this first phalanx are in a car- tilaginous state at birth; and the upper one is af- terwards affixed in form of an epipliyse. The second bone of the fingers has its base form- ed into two lateral cavities, and a middle protu- ■berance ; while the lower end has two lateral pro- tuberances and a middle cavity: therefore it is joined at both ends in the same manner, which none of the bones of the thumb are. « * Soytalidae, intemodia, scuticula, agmina, acies, condyle, articuli.

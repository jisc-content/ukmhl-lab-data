OSTEOLOGY. 51 sure: hence the ribs are converted into bone at a very early period, in order that the weight of the superincumbent parts might not impede the action of the heart. The ossification in the irregular-shaped bones, begins by a sort of nucleus, and in some such bones there are several nuclei of bone. When the ossification has gone on a certain length, the fibres of the bones become less mani- fest, the interstices between the fibres being filled up by bony matter. The long bones consist of three pieces, and in each piece there is a centre of ossification. In the shaft of the bone, we observe at first a ring of bone, from which osseous fibres extend in a direction parallel to the axis of the bone. To far the greater number of bones, whose ends are not joined to other bones by an immoveable articulation, there are smaller ones annexed, which afterwards become scarce distinguishable from the substance of the bone itself. These are called Epiphyses, or Appendices^. Some bones have one, others have two, three or four of these ap- pendices annexed by the means of cartilages, which are of a considerable thickness in children, but by age become thinner; the ossification pro- ceeding from the end of the bone on one side, and D2 * Applantatio, additamcnturri; adnascentia, adnexum, perone.

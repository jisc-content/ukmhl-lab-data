OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 2:52 some writers give it the name oi furcella or furcula inferior; or else it is unossified, in the middle. In the greatest number of adults it is ossified, and tipped with a cartilage ; in some one-half of it is cartilaginous, and in others it Is all in a cartilagi- nous state. Generally several oblique ligaments fixed at one end to the cartilages of the ribs, and โข by the other to the outer surface of the .xiphoid bonq, connect it firmly to those cartilages *. When the lower end is ossified, and is too much turned outwards or inwards f, or when the conjunction of this appendix with the second bone is too weak J, we may suffer much inconve- nience. The sternum is joined by cartilages to the seven upper ribs, unless when the first coalesces with it in an intimate union of substance ; and its un- equal cavity on each side of its upper end is fitted for the ends of the clavicles. The sternum most frequently has four round small bones, surrounded with cartilage, in chil- dren born at the full time ; the uppermost of these, which is the first bone, being the largest. * Weitbrecht, Syndesmolog. p. 121. t Rolfinc.

OF THE SPINE. 203 spinal marrow would have been in danger of being twisted, and of suffering by the compression this would have made on its tender fibrils. It is necessary to observe, that the lateral or moderator ligaments confine so much the motion of the first vertebra upon the second, that, though this joint may serve us on several occasions, yet we are often obliged to turn our faces farther round, than could be done by this joint alone, with- out the greatest danger of twisting the spinal mar- row too much, and also of luxating the oblique processes ; therefore, in large turns of this kind, the rotation is assisted by all the vertebrae of the neck and loins; and if this is not sufficient, we employ most of the joints of the lower extre- mities. This combination of a great many joints towards the performance of one motion, is also to be observed in several other parts of the body; notwithstanding such motions being generally said to be perforrried by some single joint only. The seventh* vertebra of the neck resembles in form those of the back, having the upper and low- er surfaces of its body less hollow than the others: The oblique processes are more perpendicular ; neither spinal nor transverse processes are fork- ed. This seventh and the sixth vertebra of the neck have the hole in each of their transverse pro- cesses more frequently divided by a small cross * Atlas quibusdam, maxima, magna vertebra, prominens.

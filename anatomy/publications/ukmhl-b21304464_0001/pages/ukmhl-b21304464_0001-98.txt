70 OUTLINES OT ANATOMY. ** The effects of the acetite of lead and the infu- sion of nut-galls, as they were greatly diminished on the water in which the cartilage was a second time boiled, may be fairly attributed to a little adhering extraneous animal matter, or to the pe- richondrium itself, and not to the cartilage.‚Äù Bloodvessels of Cartilage. The bloodvessels of cartilage are extremely small, and do not give passage to red blood, or the powder of vermilion. Lymphatic vessels of Cartilage. The absorbent vessels of cartilage cannot be de- monstrated ; but their existence is sufficiently ob- vious, as cartilages are absorbed during the process of ossification^ and from the effects of many dis- eases. Nerves of Cartilage. The cartilages in their healthy state do not pos- sess much sensibility, and nerves cannot be de- monstrated in them. The cartilages when destroyed are not regene- rated. The Cartilages have been divided by anatomists into two great classes, viz. into those which are permanentj and those which are temporaiy only.

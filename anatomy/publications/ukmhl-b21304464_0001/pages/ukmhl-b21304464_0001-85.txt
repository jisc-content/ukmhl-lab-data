Â©STEOLOGY. 57 To me it seems much more probable, that the bony matter is held in solution by an acid, pro- bably by the phosphoric acid, which is abstracted from it by the absorbent vessels, or that the bony matter is mixed largely with the lymph. The Fhenomena of the process of Ossification. When ossification is about to take place, there is an increased determination of blood to the part, the bloodvessels of which become suddenly larger, and admit the red globules of the blood. In a short time,.a number of white spots may be ob- served attached to the extremities of the arteries. According to some authors, the bony matter ex- udes through the sides or extremities of the ar- teries ; and according to others, the arteries are converted into bone. The earthy matter of the bones is not deposited in an uniform manner, and, in proportion as the bone is deposited, the jelly or seeming cartilage is absorbed; and thus the cavities of the bones are formed. In process of time, the bony specks ap- pended to the arteries coalesce, and become of a firmer consistence, after which layers of bone are added internally. The process of ossification is not carried on with equal rapidity in the dilfe- rent bones of the same animal, or with equal rapi- dity in the different classes of animals ; and there are some cartilages, as those of the ribs and larynx,

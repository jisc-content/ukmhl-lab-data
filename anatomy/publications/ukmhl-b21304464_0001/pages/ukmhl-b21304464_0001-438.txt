410 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. riie medullary vessels enter the scapula near the base of the spine. The substance of the scapula, as in all other broad flat bones, is cellular, but of an unequal thickness ; for the neck and third process are thick and strong. The inferior costa, spine, and cora- coid process, are of a middle thickness ; and the body is so pressed by the muscles, as to become thin and diaphanous. The scapula and clavicle are joined by plain surfaces, tipped with cartilage â€¢, by which neither bone is allowed any considerable motion, being tightly tied down by the common capsular liga- ment, and by a very strong one which proceeds from the coracoid process ; but divides into two before it is fixed into the clavicle, with such a direction, as either can allow this bone to have a small rotation, in which ' its posterior edge turns more backwards, while the anterior one rises far- ther forwards ; or it can yield to the fore-part of the scapula moving downwards, while the back- part of it is drawn upwards ; in both which cases the oblong smooth articulated surfaces of the cla- vicle and scapula are not in the same plane, but stand a little transversely, or across each other, and thereby preserve this joint from luxations, to which it would be subject, if either of the bones was to move on the other perpendicularly up and down, without any rotation. Sometimes a moveable ligamentous cartilage' is found in this joint ; in other cases a cartilage is only interposed at the

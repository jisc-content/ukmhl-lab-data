OF THE OS SPHENOIDES. 307 internal plate of the following process, which forms part of the eustachian tube *. The second pair of external processes of the cuneiform bone is the two which stand out almost perpendicular to the base of the skull. Each of them has two plates, and a middle fossa facing backwards, and should, to carry on our comparison, be likened to the bat’s legs, but are commonly said to resemble the wings of that creature ; and therefore are na- med pterygoid or aliform^ processes. The ex- ternal plates are broadest, and the internal are longest. From each side of the external plates the pterygoid muscles take their rise. At the root of each internal plate, a small hollow may be remarked, where the muscle ptery-staphylinus interims, or circumflexus palati rises, and some share of the cartilaginous end of the eustachian tube rests ; and, at the lower end of the same plate, is a hook-like rising or process, round which the tendon of the last-named muscle plays, as on a pulley. From the edge of the external plates there are some small projections of bone. There is also a little triangular thin process, which comes from each side of the body of the sphenoid bone, where the pterygoid processes are rising from it, and are extended over the lower part U2 * Winslow, Exposition Anatomique du corps humain, Traite rfes os secs, § 23S. t Naviculares,

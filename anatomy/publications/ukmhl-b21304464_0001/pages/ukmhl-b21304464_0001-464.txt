OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 436 necessary for a safe passage to the numerous ves- sels, nerves, and tendons of the fingers. T-he substance of these bones is spongy and cellular, but strong in respect of their bulk. The three first bones of the cUrpus make an ob- long head, by which they are articulated with the cavity at the lower ends of the bones of the fore- arm ; so as to allow motion to all sides, and, by a quick succession of these motions, â€˜they may be moved in a circle. But as the joint is oblong, and therefore the two dimensions are unequal, no mo- tion is allowed to the carpus round its axis, except what it has in the pronation and supination along with the radius. The articulation of the first three bones of the superior row, with the bones of the inferior, is such as allows of motion, especially backwards and forwards ; to the security and easiness of which the reception of the os magnum into the cavity formed by the scaphoides and lunare contributes considerably; And the greater number of the muscles that serve for the motion of the wrist on the radius, being inserted beyond the conjunction of the first row of bones with the second, act equ'dlly on this articulation as they do on the for- mer ; and the joint formed with the radius being the most equally moved, the first effect of these muscles is on it; and the second row of the car- pus is only moved afterwards. Thus the mo- tion of th& wrist is greater than otherwise it could have had safely ; For, if as large motion had

OF THE OS SPHENOIDES. 815 by the fore-part of its body and spinous processes, to the frontal and ethmoid bones; by its back- part, behind the two sinuses, to the occipital, where it looks like a bone with the epiphyses ta- ken off, and, as was formerly observed in the de- scription of the occipital bone, it cannot be sepa- rated without violence in adults ; to the palate bones, by the ends of the pterygoid processes, and still more by the fore-part of the internal plates of the pterygoid processes, and of the sinuses; to the maxillary bones, by the fore-part of the ex- ternal pterygoid plates ; to the vomer and nasal plate of the os ethmoides, by the processus azygos. All these conjunctions, except the last, which is a schindylesis, are said to be by the suture proper to this bone, though it is at first sight evident, that several other sutures, as the transverse, eth- moidal, &-C. are confounded with it. The sphenoid’ bone is almost complete in a foetus of nine months •, only the great alas separate after maceration from the body of the bone. The processus azygos is very large and hollow ; the thin triangular processes are not ossified; and the sinuses do not appear. THE TACE. The FACE is the irregular pile of bones, com- posing the fore and under part of the head, which

146 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY* • Vid. Plate 8, and corrupted parts of a bone. There is a ske- leton in the Museum, in which the os jrontis^ lower jaw, upper ends of the I'adius and ulna, have a great opening, with sharp points at the edges, and a much larger cavity which had nothing but a small quantity of soft spongy flesh in it when recent. The lower end of the radius is much swelled, and se* veral large holes ^are in it. The metacarpal bones are in a similar state *. The irritation in the internal parts raises some degree of inflammation in the external ones, and the ichor penetrating the periosteum, diffuses it- self in the cellular membranes, which causes thick- ness and pappiness in the teguments. The extra- vasated liquor continuing to erode the parts con- taining it increases in quantity, and forms a flue- - tuating collection under the skin, which being fretted, inflames more and more, so as to become of a more intense colour. “ The skin yields to the pressure of the con- tained liquor ; the acrid matter bursts forth at different places through the orifices. “ This matter not being produced by a kindly inflammatory suppuration, is thin and watery like whey, with some pieces of undissolved cellular membrane swimming in it; it gradually wastes the sides of the orifice of the skin, and enlarges it, to make at last a large one, from which there is a constant discharge of a watery ichor, which has little foetor.

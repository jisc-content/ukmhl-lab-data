From the nature of this sort of joint, it is plain, that very great motion cannot be allowed, without the bones going farther out of their natu- ral situation, than is convenient or safe. Ginglimus, I would reckon that articulation by the form of which the motion of the joined bones must be chiefly confined to two directions, which hinges of doors are. The first species of this is the ti'ochoides, when one bone turns on another, as a wheel does on its axis. Thus the first vertebra of the neck moves on the toothlike process of the second. This is the most pioper kind of ginglimus. The second species should be esteemed that ar- ticulation where several prominent and hollow surfaces of two bones move on each other, within the same common ligament; as in the knee, el- bow, &c.

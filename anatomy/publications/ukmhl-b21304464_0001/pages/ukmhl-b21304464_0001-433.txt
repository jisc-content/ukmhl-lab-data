405 OF THE SCAPULA. C c 3 Of the Scapula. The Scapula, or shoulder-blade, h the triangu- lar bone situated on the outside of the ribs, with its longest side, called its base, towards the spinal processes of the vertebrae, and with the angle at the upper part of this side about three inches, and the lower angle at a greater distance from these processes. The back-part of the scapula has nothing but the thin ends of the serratus an- ticus major, and subscapularis muscles between it and the ribs ; But as this bone advances forwards, its distance from the ribs increases. The upper or shortest side, called the superior costa of the scapula, is nearly horizontal, and parallel with the second rib. The lower side, which is named the inferior costa, is extended obliquely from the third to the eighth rib. The situation of this bone, here described, is when people are sitting or standing in a state of inactivity, and allowing the members to remain in the most natural easy posture. The inferior angle of the scapula is very acute ; the upper one is near to a right angle ; and what is Called the anterior, does not deserve the name, for the two sides do not meet to form an angle. The body of this bone is concave to- wards the ribs, and convex behind, where it has the name of dorsum. Three processes are gene- rally reckoned to proceed from the scapula. The first is the large spine that rises from its convex

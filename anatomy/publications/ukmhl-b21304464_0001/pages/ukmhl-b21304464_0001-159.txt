OBLICnJE MUSCLESi '■ ISI If, therefore, instead of delineating a semipenniforn^ muscle, he had delineated in the same manner a portion of the two rows of intercostal muscles, the jleshy fibres would have appeared to rUn from one rib to another in the oblique direction ; but his fibrilla membranaceez would, consistently with his general description of a muscle, have been represented as running straight or perpendicularly from one rib to another; so that if we adopt Dr Mavow’s doctrine in Cap. II., we should conclude that the motion of the ribs is primarily, chiefly or solely, performed by membranaceous fibrils or threads of cellular substance, passing straight, perpendicularly, or at right angles from one rib to another; or he retracts, and directly contra- dicts what he had before taught of the effect of the ob- liquity of the fibres of the intercostal muscles. It is therefore proved undeniably^ and very evidently, by mere quotations from his own book, that Dr Mayow was inconsistent with himself, and had no title whatso- ever to be considered “ as the discoverer of the important “ fact in physiology,” as Mr Yeates calls it, “ that “ oblique muscles possess the advantages of performing more extensive' motions than straight muscles are ca- “ pable of doing.” It of course follows, that Mr Yeates, and certain other persons, who have ascribed this discovery to Dr Mayow, had either not read his book with proper atten* lion, or had misunderstood it, or had misrepresented it. 1 S!

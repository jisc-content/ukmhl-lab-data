Causes of Deformity of the Spine. If one or more 'certebree, or their cartilages, are of unequal thickness in opposite sides, the spine must be reclined over to the thinner side ; which now sustaining tlie greatest share of the weight, must still be more compres- sed, consequently hindered from extending it- self in proportion to the other side, which, being too much freed of its burden, has li- berty to enjoy a luxuriant growth. The cau- ses on which such an hieguality of thickness in dijfet'ent sides of the vertebrcc depends may vary : for either it may be owing to an over- distension of the vessels of one side, and from thence a preternatural increase of the thickness of that part; or, w'hich more commonly is the case, it may proceed from an obstruction of the vessels, by which the application of proper nou- rishment to the bony substance is hindered, whe- ther that obstruction depends on the faulty dispo- sition of the vessels or fluids, or whet;her it is proÂ«.

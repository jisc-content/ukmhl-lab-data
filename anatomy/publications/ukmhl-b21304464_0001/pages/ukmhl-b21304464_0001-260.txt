OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 232 born children, it must be evident, that a consider- able part of this cavity is cartilaginous in them.. Of tfre connexion (f the Ossa Innominata and Sa- crum. The ossa innominata are joined at theii back part to each side of the os sacrum by a -sort of suture, with a very thin intervening cartilage, which serves as so much glue to cement these bones together; and strong ligaments go from the circumference of this unequal surface, to connect them more firmly This joining has been called posterior symphysis, in contradistinction to the an- terior symphysis. The ossa innominata are con- nected together at their fore-part by the ligament- ous cartilage interposed between the two ossa pubis. These bones can therefore have no motion in a natural state, except what is common to the trunk of the body, or to the os sacrum. It has been dis- puted, whether or not they loosen so much from each other, and from the os sacrum, in child-birth, by the throws of the labour, as that the ossa pubis recede from each other, and thereby allow the pas- sage between the bones to be enlarged. Several observationsshew that this relaxation sometimes * Bauhin. Theat. anat. lib; 1. cap. 49.—Spigel. anat. lib. 2. cap. 24.—Riolan.

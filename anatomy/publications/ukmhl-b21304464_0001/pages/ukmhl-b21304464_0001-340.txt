The sixth proper hole * cannot be well seen, till the cuneiform bdne is separated from all the other bones of the cranium ; for one end of it is hid by a small protuberance of the internal plate of the pterygoid process, and by the point of the processus petroBUS of the temporal bone. Its canal is ex- tended above the inner plate of the pterygoid process; and where it opens into the cavity of the nose, it is concealed by the thin laminous part of the palate bone. Through it a considerable branch of the second branch of the fifth pair of nerves is reflected. Often in the middle of the sella turcica a small hole or two pierce as far as the cellular substance of the bone; and some- times at the sides of this sella, one or more small holes penetrate into the sphenoidal sinuses. These observations afforded some anatomists f an argu- ment of weight in their days in defence of Ga- len who asserted the descent of the pituita that way into the sinuses below. The first of the common holes is that unequal fissure at the side of the sella turcica, between â€¢ Vesal. Anat. lib, 1. cap, 12, Eustach, Tab, 46, Fig, 13, & l6, Vidus Vidius, Anat, lib. 2. cap. 2.

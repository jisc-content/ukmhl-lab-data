OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. «72 branch of the ophthalmic artery. This hole ig ^ sometimes entirely formed in the os frontis ; in other skulls, the sides of it are composed of this last bone, and of the os planum. It is commonly known by the name of orbitarium internum^ though antcrius should be added, because of the next, which is commonly omitted. This, which may be called orbitarium internum potteriuSy is such another as the former ; only smaller, and about an inch deeper in the orbit: Through it a small branch of the ocular artery passes to the nose. Besides these six, there are a great number of small holes observable on the outer surface of this bone, parti^larly in the two protuberances above the eye-brows. Most of these penetrate no fur- ther than the sinuses, or than the diploe, if the sinuses are wanting ; though sometimes I have seen this bone so perforated by a vast number of these small holes, that, placed between the eye and a clear light, it appeared like a sieve. In the orbit of the generality of skeletons, we may observe one, two, or more holes, which allow a passage to a hog’s bristle through the skull. The place, size, and number of these, are however un- certain ; They generally serve for the transmis- sion of small arteries or nerves. The internal surface of the os frontis, is con- cave, except at the orbitar processes, which are convex, to support the anterior lobes of the brain. This surface is not so smooth as the external; for

OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 372 cessive stages of hydrocephalus chronicus, I shall conclude, by adding a few remarks on the thick- ness of the skull, and on the changes which the other bones of the body undergo in consequence of this disease. On account of the great size of the head, the bones of the cranium are generally thinner than in the healthy state ; and a case is quoted by Van SwiETEN *, in which the bones of the cranium became nearly transparent. In some instances, every portion of the skull has not been ossified, some spots of the brain being covered by membrane instead of bone f. When sheep are attacked by hydrocephalus, or when hydatids are lodged within their brains, the earthy part of the skull opposite to the seat of the disease is removed by absorption ; that part of the skull becomes soft, feels like a piece of wet pasteboard, and may be cut through, without turn- ing the edge of the knife. But in the human subject, the reverse of what has been already described, sometimes, though rarely, takes place ; for the bones of the skull, instead of becoming thinner, become thicker than common, in consequence of hydrocephalus chro- nicus J. * “ Ossa tamen capitis tenula erant adeo, ut irradiante luminc pellucerunt, sic ut interiora capitis videri potuerint."

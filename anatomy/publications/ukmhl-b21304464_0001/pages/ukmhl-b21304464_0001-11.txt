PREFACE. Xo prevent misapprehension or disappointment on the part of the Reader, I think it necessary to otter a short account of the nature and object of the following Outlines. During the thirteen years I have had the ho- nour of delivering Lectures upon Anatomy and Surgery in the University of Edinburgh, I have been repeatedly and earnestly entreated by the Students attending my Class, to publish an ab- stract of my Course. I considered it a duty to comply with their request; and the volumes now offered to the world, exhibit the subjects which are explain- ed at large in the progress of a session of six months duration.

188 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. the vertebra is stretched out laterally into a pro- cess that is named transverse. From the back-part of the roots of the two ob- lique, and of the transverse process of each side, a broad oblique bony plate is extended backwards, and where these meet, the seventh process of the vertebra: takes its rise, and stands out backwards: This being generally sharp-pointed and narrow- edged, has therefore been called spinal process; from which this whole chain of bones has got its name. Besides the common ligament which lines all the internal surface of the spinal processes, as well as of the bodies, there are particular ligaments that connect the bony bridges and processes of the contiguous vertebra together. The substance of the processes is considerably stronger and firmer, and has a thicker external plate than the bodies of the vertebra have. Vertebral Canal. The seven processes form a concavity at their fore-part, which, joined to the one at the back- part of the bodies, makes a great hole, and the holes of all the vertebra form a long large conduit*, for containing the spinal marroiv.â€” In the upper and lower edge of each lateral bridge, there is a notch. These are so adapted to each other in the contiguous vertebra, as to form a round hole in each side between each two' verte- * Canalis*

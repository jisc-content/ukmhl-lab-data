LIGAMENTS OF THE PELVIS. O'isS turator artery vein and nerve pass outwards, and get into the acetabulum, to supply the synovial apparatus within the hip-joint. The capsular ligament of the thigh-bone, is well seen in this view ; it receives some additional ligamentous fibres, the strongest of which arise from the anterior and inferior spinous process ot the os ilium, and on its pubal side, some ligamentous fibres, which take their origin from the os pubis. Sect. 111. HACK VIEW OF THE PELVIS, There are two ligaments disposed transversely, w'hich unite the os sacrum to the os innominata, besides a general capsular ligament, and there is within the joint a ligament of cellular substance, containing mucus. There is a long and strong ligament called ilio- sacral, which originates from the posterior spinous process of the spine of the os ilium, and descends obliquely into the lower part of the os sacrum. There is also a shorter ligament which is fixed higher into the os sacrum. There are also lateral ligaments extending be- tween the os ilium and the ligament which covers the spinous processes of the vertebras. The posterior part of the os sacrum is covered by a ligamentous crust, the fibres of which, fol-

558 OUTLINI.S OF ANATOMY. The former change is owing to the separation of the parietal bones ; the latter is the consequence of the separation of the upper part of the pieces composing the os frontis ; (for the lower parts of the pieces of that bone, on account of their con- nections with other bones which are ossified at an early period of life, cannot recede from each other to any distance) ; and hence the face, instead of being nearly oviform, somewhat resembles a tri- â€™ angle, of which the brow makes the basis, and the' chin the apex. As the diseas? advances, the forehead becomes unusually prominent, to such a degree, as often to prevent the unfortunate sufferer from seeing ob- jects above the level of his eyes. During the continuance of the hydrocephalus chronicus, the distance from ear to ear, or the transverse diameter of the head is increased, and the width of the head is most remarkable between the centres of ossification of the parietal bones. A disunion takes place between the upper portions of the pieces of bone which compose the os frontis, which is the cause of the very remarkable breadth of the upper part of the forehead ; and hence the forehead is somewhat of a conical form, the apex fused within the ventricles, especially if the quantity of it be large; as in such cases, in consequence of the pressure by dis- tention, a great part of the brain is absorbed, and a communica- tion is formed betwixt the water which is effused between the membranes, and that within the ventricles of the brain.

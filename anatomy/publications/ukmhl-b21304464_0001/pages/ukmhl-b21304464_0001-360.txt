OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 332 sis ; by the internal edge of the palate-plate, to one another, by the longitudinal palate suture ; on the upper and fore-part of which a furrow is left for receiving the cartilage which forms the partition of the nostrils ; between the fore-part of the nostrils and mouth, to each other, by the my- stachial suture ; sometimes they are connected to the ossa spongiosa inferiora, by a plain concretion or union of substance. These bones form the greater part of the nose and of the roof of the mouth, and a considerable share of the orbit. They contain sixteen teeth, give rise to muscles, transmission to nerves, &c. In each of the maxillary bones, of a new- born child, the external orbitar process is hollow with remarkable holes in it; there are five sock- ets for the teeth, of which the two posterior are very large, and, when divided by a second cross partition, make the number of sockets six The palate plate is cribriform about the middle f. • Albin Osteogen.

There is scarcely an appearance of the antrum maxillare; hence the remarkable change produced upon the face by the expansion of that sinus; the nose is raised, and is lengthened; the cheek bones become prominent, and by the addition of the teeth, tlie £t»ce becomes much longer.

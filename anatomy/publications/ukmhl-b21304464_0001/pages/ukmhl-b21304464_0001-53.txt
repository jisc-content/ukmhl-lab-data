OSTEOLOGY. 25 The intimate structure of Bones. Bones are composed of a great many plates^^ each of which is made up of fibres united by smaller fibrils f j which being irregularly dispo- sed, and interwoven with the other larger fibres,' make a reticular work This texture is plainly seen in the bones of foe- tuses, which have not their parts closely compac- ted, and in the bones of adults, which have been burnt, long exposed to the weather, or whose composition has been made loose by diseases. The chinks which are generally made according to the direction of the larger fibres of bones that have undergone the action of fire, or of the weather, shew the greater strength of these than of the fibres which connect them. The plates are said ยง to be firmly joined to each other by a great number of clavicuU, or small bony processes, which, rising from the inner plates, pierce through some, and are fixed into the more external ones. [Of these nails, four kinds, viz. the perpendicular, oblique, headed, and crooked, have been described; But in bones fitly prepared, I could see only numerous irregular processes rising out from the plates |j. * Squamae, bractae, laminae. t Malpigh.

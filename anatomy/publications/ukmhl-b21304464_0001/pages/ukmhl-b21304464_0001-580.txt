It is strengthened, as Caldani has represented in fig. 6th of his 50th Plate, by an uppey and un der ligament, passing from the lower and back part of the tibia, to the fibula \ by a perpendicular ligament which passes from the malleolus externus, to the os calcis; by an anterior and a posterior liga- ment, the former of which arises from the ante- rior part of the malleolus externus, and is fixed to the astragalus, and the latter arises from the posterior part of the malleolus externus, and is fix- ed to the outer and posterior part of the astraga- lus. There is also a ligament which arises from the malleolus internus, the fibres of which follow a radiated course, and are fixed tQ the astragalus, os calcis, apd os naviculare.

There are lateral and inferior ligaments, fixing together the os calcis and os cuboides. The convex articular surface of the astragalus ^ received by a concave surface of the os navicut

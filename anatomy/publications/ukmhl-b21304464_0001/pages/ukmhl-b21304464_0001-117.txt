MYOLOGY. S9 In many of the tendons, the fibres follow nearly the same direction as the fibres of the muscles: hence tendons have been stated by some authors to be muscles indurated by pressure. But the di- rection of the fibres of the tendons is in many in- stances different from that of the muscles ; for there are many muscles wdth recLdinear tendons, and also tendons with rectilinear fibres, common to two muscles, the fibres of which have different degrees of obliquity. There are many muscles in which the tendon occupies the middle of the muscle, and the fibres are placed obliquely with respect to the tendon, like the plume of a pen. Such muscles have been named Penn'ijorm muscles. There are other muscles, in which the tendons are situated at the sides of the muscles ; these have been called Semi- benniform: and in some muscles several penniform muscles are.combined, which have been named Compound penniform inuscles *. The tendons are subservient to various pur- poses. l6'^, They serve to unite the cartilages and bones to each other ; as where they supply the place of the external intercostal muscles, or where they unite the bones of the fofe-arm or of the leg to each other. 2d, Tendons add to the strength of the capsular ligaments. 3d, The tendinous aponeuroses, as the fasciae of * Vicl.

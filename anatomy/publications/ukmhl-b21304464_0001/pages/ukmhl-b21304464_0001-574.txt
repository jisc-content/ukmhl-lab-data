There is a double cartilago-ligamenious mem- brane, stretched across the breach in the inner and fore part of the acetabulum ; iu the poste- rior part of which, there is an aperture for lodg- ing a part of the synovial apparatus, and the bony margin of the acetabulum is encircled by a liga- ment, which adds considerably to its depth, called the cotyloid ligament. The muscles which surround this joint, also contribute to strengthen it. Sect. IV. OF THE SYNOVIAL APPARATUS OF THE HIP-JOINT. The acetabulum is lined by the synovial mem- brane, which also covers the synovial apparatus of this joint, which is lodged within the acetabulum, and it is then reflected over the internal ligament of the joint, and the cartilage which covers the head of the thigh-bone, and also over the neck of the same bone. The synovial membrane is very vascular, which is supplied with blood from the smaller branches of the obturator artery *. * VJd. the synovial apparatus of this joint, represented of its natural size, in fig. 3. of Plate viii. of my Fatherâ€™s Book on the Bursae Mucosae, and magnified in fig. 4. of the same Plate.

34 OUTLINES OF ANATOMT. The oil and jelly of the bones may be readily obtained by boiling bones ; the former swims on the surface, and the water dissolves the jelly. When bones have been boiled for some time,, and deprived of their jelly, and of their earthy matter by being immersed in an acid, a soft grey- ish-coloured cartilage remains, retaining the fi- gure of the bone, which, according to Mr Hat- chett*, the discoverer of this substance in bones, is similar in its properties to coagulated albumen. Several of the modern chemists have analysed bones, more especially Mr Hatchett, Fourcroy, Vauquelin, Cadet de Vaux, and Merat Guil- lot; but their researches have been limited chief- ly to the examination of the bones of quadrupeds, and few experiments have been made upon human bones, either in their sound or diseased state. In these circumstances, I requested of my friend and pupil Mr John Davy, whose chemical knowledge is well known to the public, to analyse the bones of persons of different ages, in their sound and diseased state ; with which request he readily com- plied, and has favoured me with the following re- sults : â€œ I have carefully examined the different speci- mens of bones you gave me. The experiments 1 have made on them were few, want of leisure not allowing me to be minute. I have tried them re- spectively with dilute muriatic acid, and have * Vid. Loncl. Pliil. Trans.

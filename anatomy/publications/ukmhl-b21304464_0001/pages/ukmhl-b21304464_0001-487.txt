Muscles of the Carpus and Metacaj'pus. The muscles of the carpus have been named radial or ulnar, according to the side of the fore- arm along which they pass, and internal or exter- nal, according to the condyle of the humerus, from which they take their origin. Two of the muscles of the carpus are flexors^ â€¢ and three extensors of the hand. Epitrochlo-Metacarpeus or Flexor Carpi Ra- dialis. This muscle proceeds from the internal condyle of the os humeri, and from the fore and upper part of the ulna ; its tendon is long, and passes through the fossa of the os trapezium, and is inserted into the fore and upper part of the metacarpal bone of the fore-finger.

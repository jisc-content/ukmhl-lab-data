OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. SIS one next to it is the longest, and with its sharp edge almost perpendicular. The others are short- er and more oblique, as their situation is more ex- ternal. Which general remarks, with the de- scription I am now to give of each, may teach us to distinguish them from each other. T/ie os metatarsi pollicis, is by far the thickest and strongest, as having much the greatest weight to sustain. Its ^base is oblong, irregularly concave, and of a semilunar figure, to be adapted to the os cuneiforme maximum. The inferior edge of this base is a little prominent and rough, where the tendon of the peronaeus primus muscle is inserted. On its outside an oblique circular depression is made by the second metatarsal bone. Its round ' head has generally on its fore-part a middle ridge, and two oblong cavities, for the ossa sesamoidea; and on the external side, a depression is made by the following bone. The os metatarsi of the second toe, is the longest of â–  the five, with a triangular base supported by the ps cuneiforme medium, and the external side pro- duced into a process ; the end of which is an ob- lique smooth plane, joined to the os cuneiforme externum. Near the internal edge of the base, this bone has two small depressions, made by the . os cuneiforme maximum, between which is a rough cavity. Farther forwards, we may-observe a smooth protuberance, which Is joined to the foregoing bone. On the outside of the base are two oblong smooth surfaces, for its articulation

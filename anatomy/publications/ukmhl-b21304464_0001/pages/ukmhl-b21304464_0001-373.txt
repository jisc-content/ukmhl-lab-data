OF THE LOWER JAW. 34>5 ire tipped with a cartilage, as the articulated parts of all other moved bones are. - \ The fore parts of the root and neck of these condyloid processes are a little hollow and rough, where the external pterygoid muscles are inserted. The holes of the lower jaw are two on each side ; one at the root of the processes internally, where a large branch of the third branch of the fifth pair of nerves enters with an artery, and a vein returns. A small sharp process frequently juts out backwards from the edge at the fore- part of this hole, to which a ligament extended from the temporal bone is fixed which saves the nerve and vessels from being too much pres- sed by the pterygoid muscles. From the lower side of this hole, either a small superficial canal or a furrow descends, where a branch of the nerve is lodged, in its way to the mylo-hyoideus muscle and sublingual gland f. The other hole is exter- nal, at the confines of the chin, where branches of the nerve and vessels come out. The canal betwixt these two holes is formed in the middle of the substance of the bone, and is pierced by a great number of small holes by which the nerves and bloodvessels of the cancelli and teeth pass. This canal is continued a little farther than the external hole at the chin. On account of the vessels and nerves in the . â€¢ Weitbrecht, Syndesmolog. fig. 32. 1. t Palfyn. Anat.

OUTLINES OF ANATOMNY. 578 Explanation of Plate \9th. Fig. 1. was copied from the skull of a Hindoo, which I received from Mr Thomas, surgeon in London. Fig. 2. was copied from a skull of an Esquimaux, which was sent to my colleague Professor Jameson. The fore-head is narrow, the skull flat at its sides, and the superior maxillary bones remarkably large. This skull differs a good deal from those represented by Blumekdach Fig. 3. was copied from the skull of a Negro. This view does not give a good idea of the cranium of the Negro ; for the retreating forehead, and flatness of the occiput, are. the most remarkable features of it. The great size of the bones of the face and of the teeth, is very apparent. Explanation of Plate 9,0th. In this plate three very remarkable skulls are repre- sented. Fig. 1. represents the skull of a Carib, of the Island of St Vincent, which, in consequence of pressure having been applied to the forehead, is much distorted. It may be mentioned, that this specimen perfectly agrees in its characters with a skull of the same nation, in the museum of Mr CiiiNE ; and also with one in the possession of Dr W. E. Leach. The forehead is remarkably flat, as also the sides of the head. There is a ridge on the vertex of the skull. • Vitl.

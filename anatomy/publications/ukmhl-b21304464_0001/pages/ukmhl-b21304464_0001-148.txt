OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 120 ones, not only with a smaller proportional, but with a smaller actual decurtation of their fibres ; and of course, that when they are contracted to the same proportional or actual degree, their mo- tions are more extensive ; we may observe in many cases, where an increase of strength is chiefly in- tended by the obliquity of tbe fibres of the muscles, that they are employed also for increasing the ex- tent of motion. Thus, the upper and lower por- tions of the trapezius muscle, or the two lateral portions of the deltoid muscle co-operating, can produce more extensive motion of the scapula and of the humerus, than could be done by the middle portions of,these muscles. In like manner, the external and internal oblique muscles of the ab- domen co-operating, appear to be capable of bend- ing the thorax forwards in as great a degree as can be done by the recti, although their fibres are considerably shorter. 4. As the oblique muscles can, with a smaller degree of decurtation, perform the same extent of motion as a straight one, it follows, that the same motions performed by them, will be executed in a shorter space of time thap could have been exe- cuted by straight muscles of the same length, pro- vided we take for granted, that the time in which the action of a muscle is completed, bears a pro- portion to the length of the muscle. To support in some measure this supposition, we may observe, that similar actions of small animals ar? completed sooner than those of larger j or if we compare the

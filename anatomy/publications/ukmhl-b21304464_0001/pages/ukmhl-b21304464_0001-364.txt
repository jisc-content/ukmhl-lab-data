OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 336 of the ethmoid bone, to which it is contiguous ; it is placed on the aperture of the sinus sphenoida- lis, so as to leave only a round hole at its upper fore-part. The other part of the orbitar process is extended along the internal side of the upper . back-part of the maxillary tuberosity, to the base of the sphenoid bone, between the root of the pro- cessus azygos and the pterygoid process. The palate square part of this palate bone, and its pterygoid process, are firm and strong, with some cancelli; but the nasal plate and orbitar pro- cesses are very thin and brittle. The palate bones are joined to the maxillary, by the fore-edge of the palate square-bone, by the transverse palate suture : By their thin nasal plates, and part of their orbitar processes, to the same bones, by the palato maxillares sutures: By their pterygoid processes, and back-part of the nasal plates, to the alae vespertilionum, by the sphenoid suture ; By the transverse ridges of the nasal plates, to the ossa spongiosa inferiora, by contact; hence frequently there is an intimate union of the substance of these bones in old skulls; By the orbitar processes, to the ossa plana and * an ulcer of the internal canthus of the eye eats tlirough the ligamentous membrane, which connects the edge of the orbit to the eye, it naturally falls to the under part of the apex of the conical orbit, where the orbitar process of the palate- bone is; and once it is rendered carious, the caries proceeds downwards in the same bone to the part of it which forms “ the palate, and erodes it, and the membrane that covers it.’*

They are joined above to the frontal bone, by ' the middle of the transverse suture ; behind, to the maxillary bones, by the lateral nasal sutures ; below, to the cartilages of the nose ; before, to one another, by the anterior nasal suture; inter- nally, to the septum narium. These bones serve to cover and defend the root of the nose. In an infant, the nasal bones are proportionally shorter, and thinner at their upper part, than in an adult, and porous on the internal surface. Ossa Unguis. The Ossa Unguis, or lacrtmalia, are so named, because their figure and magnitude are something near to those of a nail of oneâ€™s finger, and because the tears pass upon them into the nose. Their external surface is composed of two smooth concavities and a middle ridge. The de- pression behind forms a small share of the orbit for the eye-ball to move on, and the one before is a deep perpendicular canal, or fossa, larger above than below, containing part of the lacrymal sac and duct. This is the part that ought to be pier- ced in the operation for the fistula lacrymalis*. This fossa of the bone is cribriform, or has a great See an account of the disease called Fistula lacrymalis, ii> the Works by Dr Monro primus, p. 522. VOL. I. X

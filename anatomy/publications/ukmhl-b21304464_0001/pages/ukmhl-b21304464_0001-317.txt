The internal proper foramina of each of these bones are, Jirst, the internal meatus auditorius in the posterior plain side of the petrous process* This hole soon divides into two; one of which, is the beginning of the aqueduct of Fallopius; the other ends in several very small canals *, that al- low a passage to the branches of the portio mollis of the seventh pair of nerves, into the â€™cestibuls and cochlea. Through it also an artery is sent, to be distributed to the organ of hearing. The se- cond hole, which is on the anterior plain side of the craggy process, gives passage to a reflected branch of the second branch of the fifth pair of nerves, which joins the portio dura of the auditory nerve, while it is in the aqueduct f, small branches of bloodvessels accompanying the nerves, or pas- sing through smaller holes near this one. The passage of the cutaneous vein into the lateral sinus, or of a branch of the occipital artery, is seen about 'the middle of the large fossa for that sinus; and the orifice of the canal of the carotid artery, is evi- dent at the under-part of the point of the petrous process. Besides these proper holes of the temporal bones which appear on their external and internal sur- faces, there are two others in each side, that are * Dr MoNiio 2d on the Nervous System, tab. xxiv< t Dr Monro 2d on the Ear.

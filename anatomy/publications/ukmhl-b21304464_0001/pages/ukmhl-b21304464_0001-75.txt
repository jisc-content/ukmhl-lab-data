OSTEOLOGY. 47 animals advance in age, the arteries of the bones become less capacious; as is evident, 1. From the bones of adults having less blood in them than those of children have. 2. From many of them becoming incapable, in old age, of admitting the coloured powders used in injections, which easily pass in youth. The arteries are accompanied with veins, which can sometimes be injected and then seen. Lymphatic Vessels of Bones. From what has been said of the vessels of bones, it is evident, that there is a constant circulation of fluids in every part of them ; and that there is a perpetual waste and renewal of the particles which compose the solid fibres of bones, as well as of other parts of the body; the addition from the fluids exceeding the waste during the growth of the bones ; the renewal and waste keeping pretty near par in adult middle age ; and the waste ex- ceeding the supply from the liquors in old age ; as is demonstrable from their weight; For each bone increases in weight, as a person approaches to maturity ; continues of nearly the same weight till old age begins, and then becomes lighter. The specific gravity of the solid sides, on the con- trary, increases by age, for then they become more hard, compact and dense. In consequence of this, the bones of old people are thinner and firmer in their sides, and have larger cavities than those of younger persons.

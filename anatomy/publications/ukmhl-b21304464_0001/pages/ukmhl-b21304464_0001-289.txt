261 SUTURES OF THE SKULL. This suture is sometimes very irregular, being made up of a great many small sutures which sur- round so many little bones that are generally larger and more conspicuous on the external sur- face of the skull, than internally. These bones are generally called triquetra or wormiana ; but some other name ought to be given them, for they are not always of a triangular figure ; and older anatomists* than Olaus Wormius f have described them. The anatomists generally agree, that their formation is owing to a greater number of points than ordinary of ossification in the skull, or to the ordinary bones of the cranium not extend- ing their ossification far enough or soon enough ; in which case, the unossified interstice between such bones, begins a separate ossification in one or more points; from which the ossification is extend- ed to form as many distinct bones as there were points, that are indented into the large ordinary bones, and into each other. Ossa triquetra are sometimes seen in other su- tures, as well as in the lambdoid if, and some- R 3 • Eustach. Ossium Exatnen. Bauhin. Theat. Anat. lib. 3. cap. 5.

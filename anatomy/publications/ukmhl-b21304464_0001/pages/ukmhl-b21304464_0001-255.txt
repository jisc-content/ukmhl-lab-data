OF THE OS PHBIS* S27 The part of the os ischium which forms the acetabulum, the spinous process, the great tuber, and the recurved leg,''are all cartilaginous at birth. The tuber, with part of the leg or process above it, becomes an epiphyse before this bone is-fully formed. Os Pubis. The Os Pubis *â– , or shafe bone, is the ItCist of the three parts of the os innominatum, and is placed at the upper fore-part of it. The thick largest part of this bone is employ- ed in forming the acetabulum ; from which be- coming much smaller, it is stretched inwards to its fellow of the other side, whefe again it grows larger^ and sends a small branch down- wards to join the eild of the small leg of the os ischium. The upper fore-part of each os pubis is tuberous and rough where the musculus rectus and py- ramidalis are inserted. From this a ridge is ex- tended along the upper edge of the bone, in a continued line with such another of the os ilium, which divides the abdomen and pelvis. The ligament of Fallopius, or crural arch, is fixed to the internal end of this ridge, and the smooth hollow below it is made by the psoas and iliacus in- â€™ pectinis, penis pudibuhdum> fenestratuxn, /.

OF THE THUMB. 443 as the joints do where a round head of one bone plays in the orbicular socket of another j only it is somewhat more confined and less expeditious, but stronger and more secure, than such joints ge- nerally are. This bone of children is in the same state with the metacarpal bones. The seco72d bont of the thumb is somewhat like the third of the fingers, and has a large base formed into an oblong cavity, whose greatest length is from one side to the other. Round it several tubercles may be remarked, for the inser- tion of ligaments. Its body is convex, or a half- round behind ; but flat before, for lodging the tendon of the long flexor of the thumb, which is tied down by ligamentous sheaths that are fixed on each side to the angle at the edge pf this flat surface. The lower end of this second bone has two lateral round protuberances, and a middle ca- vity, whose greatest extent of smooth surface js forwards. The articulation and motion of the upper end of this second bone is as singular as that of the former. For its cavity being joined to the round head of the first bone, it would seem at first view to move in all directions \ yet, because of the strength of its lateral ligaments, oblong figure of the joint itself, and mobility of the first joint, ^his joint can be bended and extended only. The bones of the fingers are arranged iu three

116 Outlines of anatomy. their length till the ensiForm cartilage is brought down to D, the middle of the line that is drawn be! ween their origins. Let us next suppose two muscles, each thirteen inches long, to be laid so obliquely, that a line drawn perpendicularly from their insertion to the middle of a line joining their origins (See Plate 3. fig. 8.) measures five inches. If these muscles shorten themselves a single inch, the place of their insertion will be moved through a space of five inches, or five times farther than it could be by the action of two straight muscles. 9- To make the justness of these conclusions quite evident to those who have not been used to geo- metrical demonstrations, or arithmetical calcula- tions, I shall now shew, by the figure of a w'ooden machine, an imitation of the effects of oblique muscles, (See Plate 3. fig. 9.) In the middle of a piece of wood AAAA, I have cut a groove BC, the sides of which may represent two straight muscles. I now apply on each side a .piece of metal BD, BD, representing an oblique muscle, stretched from the side of the base to the top of the perpendicular. The upper ends of these tw'o pieces of metal are joined together by a pin E, which perforates them and slides in the groove BC. The lower ends D, D of these pieces are slit, and passed over iron pins EF, in the sides of the base of the

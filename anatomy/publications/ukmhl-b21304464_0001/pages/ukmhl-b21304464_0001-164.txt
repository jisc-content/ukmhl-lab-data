OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 136 ' In the engravings by Bartolozzi *, after the drawings of Leonardo da Vinci, in his Majesty’s collection, there are many good views of the bones, and also of the muscles. CHAPTER VII. GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE BURS^ MUCOSJE, vesica: unguinos.e, or BURS.E SYNOVIALES. rp 1 HE term Bursa Mucosa was applied by Al- EiNUS to certain shut sacs, which he discovered placed under the tendons of the muscles. Al- binos has enumerated only 1(5 pairs of these, not being aware that tendons within sheaths were pro- vided with similar, but oblong-shaped bursae. My Father discovered many of the bursae, and has described, in his Treatise on these shut sacs, 140 of them. The bursae mucosae are of different sizes, and are interposed between such parts as rub violently upon each other. They are connected by cellu- lar substance to the capsular ligaments, muscles, and their tendons, in such a manner as to lessen the effect of attrition. ♦ Published by Mr CuAMBERLAiNis,

OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 492 salii. The posterior plane is broad and hollow, giving origin to the larger share of the tibialis posticus. The internal angle of this bone has a tendinous membrane fixed to it, from which fibres of the flexor digitorum longus take their rise. The posterior surface of the fibula is the plainest and smoothest, but is made flat above by the so- laeus, and is hollowed below by the flexor pollicis longus. In the middle of this surface the canal for the medullary vessels may be seen slanting downwards. I have made particular mention of the course of the medullary vessels of the larger bones of the extremities *; because, in several chirurgi- cal cases, a surgeon, who is ignorant of this, may do mischief to his patient. Thus, for example, if these vessels are opened very near to their en- try into the bone, or while they are in the oblique passage through it, an obstinate haemorrhagy may ensue : For the arteries being connected to the bony passage, styptics, are vainly applied; compres- sing instruments can do no service, and ligatures cannot be employed. There seems to he a particular design in the contrivance of these canals ; those in the os humeri, tibia, and fibula, running oblique- ly downwards from their external entry ; whereas in the radius, ulna, and os femoris, they slant up- wards, whereby the arteries and nerves which * Havers, Osteolog. nov. disc. 1. p. 55*

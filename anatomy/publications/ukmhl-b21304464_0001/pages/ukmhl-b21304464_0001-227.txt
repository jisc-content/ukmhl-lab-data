199 OF THE SPINE. In new-born children, the lateral pieces only of this vertebra are ossified ; the arch, which it has at its fore-part instead of a body, being cartila- ginous. Second Vertebra, or Vertebra Dentata. The body of this vertebra is somewhat of a pyramidal figure, being large, and produced down- wards, especially at its fore-side, to enter into a hollow of the vertebra below •, while the upper part has a square process with a small point stand- ing out from it, somewhat resembling a tooth *, and hence the name vertebra dentata. The side of this process on which the hollow of the an- terior arch of the first vertebra plays, is convex, smooth, and covered with a cartilage ; and it is of the same form behind, for the ligament, which is extended transversely from one rough protuberance of the first vertebra to the other, and is cartilaginous in the middle, to move on it. A ligament likewise goes out in an oblique transverse direction, from each side of the pro- cessus dentatus, to be fixed at its other end to the first vertebra, and to the occipital bone; and an- other ligament rises up from near the point of the process to near the os occipitis.

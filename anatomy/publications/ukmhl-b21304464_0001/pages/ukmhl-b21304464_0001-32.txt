C’est la nature, et non la science, qui a tir6 une ligne de demarca- tion entr’eux.” These tissues, in whatever part of the body they are situated, exhibit the same physical pro- perties ; apd, further, each particular tissue is subject to peculiar organic derangements*. Anatomy, so far as it considers the solids, has been divided into various branches, distinguished by different names, of Greek etymology, expres- sive of the parts referred to ; as, 'Osteology, A Description of the Bones. Syndesmology, • • Of the Ligaments. Myology, Of the Muscles. Splanchnology, - - Of the Bowels. Adenology, Of the Glands. * From the remarkable coincidence in the sentiments, and in many of the passages of Dr Carmichael Smyth’s paper on In- flammation, published in the 2d volume of the London Medical Communications, and in Bichat’s Traite des Membranes, and in his Anatomie Generale, I cannot but think that Dr C, Smyth was the author of the New System, which has prepared the way to a more minute, accurate, and philosophical examina- tion of the structure and properties of our different organs j and which has tended so much to the advancement of physiological and pathological science, which now indeed has assumed a new -aspect.

Of the Source of Bone. This subject has been much agitated by phy- siologists, and has given rise to much contrariety of opinion. According to some authors, the bone is derived from the vessels of the periosteum; and according to others, from the arteries proper to the substance of the bones. Mr Du Hamel was a strenuous supporter of the first of the above hypotheses, and supposed that the layers of the periosteum were gradually con- verted into bone, in the same manner as tim- ber is formed by the hardening of the white sub- stance between the inner bark and the wood. He endeavoured to give weight to his favourite theory, by feeding animals with madder for a time, and then on ordinary food, by which the bones were rendered alternately white and red. That the vessels of the periosteum form bone, is rendered probable from the effect of external violence, which is in some cases followed by the

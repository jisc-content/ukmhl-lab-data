OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. So that these lateral ligaments are the proper moderators of the circumgyratio of the head here, which must be larger or smaller, as these ligaments are weaker, or stronger, longer, or shorter, and more or less capable of being stretched. Besides the revolution on this axis, the first vertebra can move a small way to either side ; but is prevented from moving backwards and for- wards, by its anterior arch, and by the cross liga- ment, which are both closely applied to the tooth- like process. Motion forwards here would have been of very bad consequence, as it would have brought the beginning of the spinal marrow upon the point of the tooth-like process. The rotatory motion of the head is of great use to us on many accounts, by allowing us to apply quickly our organs of the senses to objects: and the axis of rotation was altogether proper to be at this place ; for if it had been at a greater dis- tance from the head, the weight of the head, if it had at any time been removed from a perpendi- cular bearing to the small very moveable joint, and thereby had acquired a long lever, would have broken the ligaments at every turn inconsiderately performed; or these ligaments must have been formed much stronger than could have been con- nected to such small bones. Nor could this circular motion be performed on the first vertebra without danger, because the immoveable part of the medulla oblongata is so rear, that at each large turn, the beginning of the

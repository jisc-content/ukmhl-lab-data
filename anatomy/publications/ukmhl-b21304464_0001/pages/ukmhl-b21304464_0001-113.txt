MYOLOGY. 85 the different muscles of the same animal, and bears a ratio to the strength of the muscle ; for the muscles are invigorated, become larger by use, and acquire greater force and energy ; hence the difference in the size of the muscles of the Hercules Farnese, Antinous, and Venus de Medicis. This truth is also strongly exemplified, by comparing the same muscles in wild and domestic birds. The former are hard, red coloured, fibrous, tough, and strong smelling ; the latter are soft, white, and delicate. The form of the different muscles is very various ; being modified and adapted to their particular office, as it is a law in the animal eco- nomy, that a muscle always contracts towards its centre. The larger fibres of the muscles may be subdi- vided into smaller fibres. Leewenhoek, whose microscopical observations were so celebrated, sup- posed he had discovered the ultimate division of a muscle, and calculates, that in the fibres of some' muscles there are 3200 filaments. The ultimate filaments have been said to be solid*, hollow f, or vesicularTo me, the smaller fibres seem to be perfectly similar to the larger. F 3 * Gottsched.

Fig. 2. this engraving was copied from the skull of n Russian, which is nearly of a globular figure. Fig. 3. this engraving was copied from the skull of a Turk. The globular form of the skull, and great size of the bones of the face, and especially of the ossa maxil- laria superiora, are the most striking features of this skull. '

OF THE OS HUMERI. 413 the teres minor, is inserted. Between these two tubercles, exactly in the fore-part of the bone, a deep long fossa is formed, for lodging the ten- dinous head of the biceps jlexor cubiti; which, after passing, in a manner peculiar to itself, through the cavity of the articulation, is tied down by a tendinous sheath extended across the fossa; in which, and in the neighbouring tubercles, are several remarkable holes, which are penetrated by the tendinous and ligamentous fibres, and by vessels. On each side of this fossa as it descends in the os humeri, a rough ridge, gently flatted in the middle, runs from the roots of tlrp tubercles. The tendon of the pectoral muscle is fixed into the anterior of these ridges, and the latissimus dorsi, and teres major, are inserted into the internal one. A little behind the lower end of this last, another rough ridge may be observed, where the coraco- is inserted. From the back-part of the root of the largest tubercle, a ridge also is con- tinued, from which the brevis extensor cubiti rises. This bone is flatted on the inside, about its middle, by the belly of the biceps flexor cubiti. In the middle of this plain surface, the entry of the medullary artery is seen slanting obliquely down- wards. At the fore-side of this plane, the bone rises in a sort of ridge, which is rough, and often has a great many small holes in it, where the ten- don of the strong deltoid muscle is inserted; on each side of which, the bone is smooth and flat, where the brachiaeus internus rises.

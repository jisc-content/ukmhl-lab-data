OF THE SPINE. 215 tebrje are joined ; and therefore the same motions may be performed here. The articulation of the lower part of the os sa- crum to the os coccygis seems well enough adapt- ed for allowing considerable motion to this last bone, was it not much confined by ligaments. La- terally, the os sacrum is joined to the ossa ilia by an immoveable synchondrosis, or what almost deserves the name of a suture; for the cartilagi- nous crust on the surface of the bones is very thin, and both their surfaces are so scabrous and un- equal, as to be indented into each other ; which makes such a strong connexion, that great force is required to separate them, after all the muscles and ligaments are cut. Frequently the two bones grow together in old subjects. The os sacrum serves as the common base and support of the trunk of the body^ to guard the 7ierves proceeding from the end of the spinal mar- rou\ to dej'end the back part of the pelvis, and to afford sufficient origin to the muscles which move the trunk and thigh *. State at Birth.â€”The bones that compose the os sacrum of infants, are separated from each other by a thick cartilage ; and, in the same manner as the true vertebrae, each of them consists of a body and two lateral plates, connected together by car- tilages ; the ends of the plates seldom being con- tiguous behind.

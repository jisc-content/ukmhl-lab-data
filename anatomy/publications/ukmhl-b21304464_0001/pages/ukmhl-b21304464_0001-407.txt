379 EXPLANATION OF PLATES. The bones of the nose are very long, and the distances between the orbits are of a very peculiar shape, and diffe- rently placed from those of the other skull. The under part of the occipital bone is much flattened. ■ Thibault, De Chanvalon and Labat bear testimony, that this very remarkable form of the skull, is the result of pressure artificially applied. Labat, tom. ii. p. 72, has observed,—Les Caraibes sont tous bien faits et bien proportionnes; les traits du visage assez agr^ables.

The engraving is so accurate and so characteristic, as to require no illustration. Fig. 3. was copied from a portion of the skull of a Mummy, which is filled with pitch. It is the most remarkable skull in point of form, which I have ever seen, or seen represented. It is narrower than common between the external angular processes of the frontal bones, measuring only three inches and three quarters : the transverse diameter behind, between the junctions of the squamous and lamb- doidal sutures on the opposite sides of the skull, mea- sured only four inches and a quarter, whereas^ost skulls, at the same place, measure six inches or nearly so : the

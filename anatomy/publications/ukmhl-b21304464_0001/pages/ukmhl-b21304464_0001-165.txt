BURSiE MUCOSA. 137 1^/^, The bursae are situated between bones,—aa between the clavicle and coracoid processes of the scapula. 2^/, Between bone and ligaments,—as betM^een the acromion and ligaments of the humerus. 3d, Between tendon and ligament,—as between the tendon of the psoas, iliacus internus, and liga- ment of the hip-joint. 4///, Between two tendons,—as between the ten- dons of the extensores carpi, longior and brevior. 5th, Between tendon and its sheath,—as within the sheaths of the tendons of the fingers and toes. 6th, Between tendon and cartilage,—as between the tendon of the superior oblique muscle of the eye, and its cartilaginous pulley. 7th, Between tendon and bone,—as between the tendon of the scapulo-radialis muscle and radius, &c. The bursae are larger in the extremities than in the trunk of the body, and are either of a rounded or oval shape, or somewhat like purses, including the sheaths of the tendons: hence the bursae have been arranged under two great classes, the Sphe~ rical and the Vaginal BurscE The bursae mucosae of children are propor- tionally larger than those of the adult. The proper membranes of the bursae, though remarkably thin, are capable of confining fluids, and even air, and, according to my Father, are in structure similar to the internal layer of ^he capsular ligaments o/ the joints, to the pleura, periosteumj

259 OF THE SKULL. The diploe in the old, is often so obliterated, that scarce any vestige of it can be seen ; neither is it observable' in some of the hard bones at the base of the skull. Hence from the bleeding, want of resistance, and change of sound, as marks in the operation of the trepan, it is impossible to know when the instrument has sawed through the first table, and reached the diploe The diploe sometimes attains a monstrous thickness, while the tables of the skull are thinner than paper. The cranium of the adult consists of seven bones only, though eight have been commonly enumerated ; six of which are said to be proper, and the other two are reckoned common to it, and to the face. The six proper, are the os Jrofitis, two ossa pa?'iet(ilia, two ossa temporwrif and the os occipitTS. The common are the os ethmoides and os sphemides. The os frontis forms the whole fore-part of the vault; the two ossa parietalia form the upper and middle part of it ; the ossa temporum compose the lower part of the sides ; the os occipitis makes the whole hinder part, and some of the base ; the os ethmoides is placed in the fore-part of the base, and the os sphenoides is in the middle of it.

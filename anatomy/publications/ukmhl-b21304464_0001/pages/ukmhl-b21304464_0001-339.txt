OF THE SPHENOIDES, 311 ©f the branch of the internal carotid artery that is sent to the eye. The second is the foramen lacerum, or large slit between the transverse spin- ous and orbitar processes: the interior end of which slit is large ; and, as it is extended out- wards, it becomes narrower. The outer end of it is formed in the os frcntis ; and therefore this might be reckoned among the common foramina. Through it the third, fourth, the first branch of the fifth, and the greater share of the sixth pair of nerves, and an artery from the internal carotid, go into the orbit. Sometimes a small branch of the external carotid enters its end, to be distribut- ed to the dura mater *, and a vein, some call it the venous duct, or, Nuck's aqueduct, returnsthrough it to the cavernous sinus. The third hole, situated a little behind the one just now described, is called rotundum, from its shape. It allows passage to the second branch of the fifth pair of nerves, or su- perior maxillary nerve. The fourth is the foramen ovale, about half an inch behind the round hole. Through it the third branch of the fifth pair, or inferior maxillary nerve, goes out; and sometimes a vein from the dura mater passes out here f. Very near the point of the spinous process is the fifth hole of this bone: it is small and round, for • Winslow, Exposition Anatonjiqae du corps humain, Traite des Arteres, § 60. & de la Tete, J 26. + Ingrass.

Bruises by falls on this part, are, on account of the tendons which are fixed into, or pass over the great trochanter, attended with great pain and weakness of the limb of long duration. The body of the os femoris is convex on the fore-part, and concave behind. The fore-part of the thigh-bone is a little flatted above by the be- ginning of the cruraeus muscle, as it is also below by the same muscle and the rectus. Its external surface is likewise flat below. The posterior con- cave surface has a ridge rising in its middle, com- monly called Mnea aspera^ into which the triceps is inserted, and the short head of the biceps flexor tibiae rises from it. At the upper part of it the medullary vessels enter by a small hole that runs obliquely up- wards. A little above which, there is a rough fossa or two, where the tendon of the glutaeus maximus is fixed. The lower end of the linea aspera di- vides into two, which descend toward each side. The two vasti muscles in part arise from these ridges ; and the long tendon of the triceps is fix- ed to the internal, by means of part of the fascia aponeurotica of the thigh. Near the beginning

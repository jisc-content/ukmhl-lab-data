OBLIQUE 3^^USCLES. â€˜IIS taken together are longer than the third side of that triangle, or than the straight line ALK, it fol- lows, that BK must he longer than LK, or longer than the oblique muscle after one-third of the length of the straight one is taken off from it; or that the oblique muscle, after bringing its inser- tion to the same point as the straight muscle had done, has not lost so much of its length as the straight muscle had lost. 6. I have found that I might go a step farther, and prove that two oblique can produce a more extensive motion than two straight muscles of the same length, and which at first sight seem much better fitted for the purpose. Thus, in Plate 3. fig. 6. let the lines ABC D E F represent two straight muscles ; and the lines ALMN tw'o oblique muscles of the same length with the straight ones. Let us next suppose that these muscles are ca- pable of shortening themselves one-fifth of their length, and that the straight muscles have brought the point A down to B. ' Let us next suppose that the two oblique muscles have done the same thing. It is now evident that the oblique muscles have not lost one-fifth part of their length ; because the angle BLx\ of an isosceles triangle being smaller than a right angle, the angle BLN must be larger than it; or the angle BLN being equal to the twt> VOL.

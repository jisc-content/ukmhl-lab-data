The os occipitis is -joined by a double articulation to the first vertebra of the neck, each condyle being received into a superior oblique process of that vertebra. In an infant born at the full time, this bone is divided, by unossified cartilages, into four parts. The first of these is larger than the other three, is of a triangular shape, and constitutes all the part of the bone above the great foramen. Generally fissures -appear in the upper part and sides of this triangular bone, when all the cartilage is separated by maceration ; and sometimes little distinct bones are seen towards the edges of it. The second and third pieces of this bone are exactly alike, and situated on each side of the great foramen ; from which very near the whole condyles are produced ; and they are extended forwards almost to the fore- part of the hole for the ninth pair of nerves. The * In the adult, the occipital and sphenoid bones are firmly fixed to each other; and hence Soemmeiung has described them under the name of Os spheno-occipitale.

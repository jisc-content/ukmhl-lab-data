99 MYOLOGY. The movements of the body are regulated by the form of the bones, the disposition of the ar- ticular surfaces, the manner in which the muscles are fixed to the bones, and the direction of the muscular fibres. 1st, There is an exact relation between the joint and the muscles which move it. Thus, at the elbow and knee joints, there are muscles capable of performing flexion and exten- sion only ; but at the shoulder and hip joints, muscles are superadded, for performing the rota- tory movements of which these joints admit. 2d, Muscles act only by a contractile power ; the contraction is succeeded by relaxation, by winch the muscle returns to its jbrmer state. Such being the nature of the muscles, it fol- lows, that motion can be produced only by the agency of antagonist muscles, of flexor and exten- sor muscles ; and where balancing of the body is required, the flexions and extensions are accom- modated to the centre of gravity, or vice versa. 'Such a disposition of the muscles is also condu- cive to the aspect and symmetry of the body : thus the mouth, for instance, is kept in the middle of the face, by the agency of the muscles of its opposite sides balancing each other, as is very .evi- dent when the equipoise is destroyed by a palsy of the muscles of one,side of the face, then the mouth is drawn to the opposite side. It is evident that the centre of gravity varies in the different attitudes of the body ; and hence a G%

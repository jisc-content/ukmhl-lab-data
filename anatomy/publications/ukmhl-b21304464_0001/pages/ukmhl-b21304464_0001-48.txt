20 OUTLINHS OF ANATOMT. ancients may be comprehended ; scarcely any un- moved bones being joined by plain surfaces*. 2. Gomphosis f, is the fixing one bone into an- other as a nail is fixed in a board ; Thus the teeth ,are secured in their sockets. 3. Schbidylesis or ploughing when a thin lamella of one bone is received into a long narrow- furrow of another : Thus the processus axygos of the sphenoid, and the nasal process of the ethmoid bone, are received by the vomer. The third class, or di arthrosis ยง, is the articu- lation where the'bones are so loosely connected as to allow large motion. This is subdivided into three kinds : The first is enarthrosis, or the ball and socket, . when a large head is received into a deep cavity ; as the head of the os femoris is into the acetabulum coxendicis. The second is arthrodia, when a round head is received into a superficial cavity ; as in the arti- culation of the arm-bone and scapula. These two species of diarthrosis allow motion to all sides. The third is ginglimus |1, which properly signi- fies the hinge of a door or window *, in it the parts of the bones mutually receive, and are re- * Vesal. Observ. Fallop, Exanien. t Conclavatio.

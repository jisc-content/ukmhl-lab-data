OF THE FACE. 319 The connexion of the ossa spongiosa to the side of each nostril, is so much by a membrane in young subjects, by a sort of hook, and afterwards by concretion or union of substance in adults, that I did not know well how to rank it: But if any chuses to call it a suture, the addition of two transverse nasal sutures may be Tnade to those above named. These sutures of the face, (formerly called harmonice), have not such conspicuous inden^. rations as those of the skull; the bones not ha- ving substance enough for forming large inden- tations, and there being less necessity for se- curity against external injuries, or any internal protruding force, than in the cranium. These sutures often disappear in old people, by the bones running into each other ; which can do little pre- judice, because the principal use of the bones be- ing so numerous here, is to allow them to be ex- tended into a proper form.â€™ It is evident, from the manner of the conjunc. tion of these bones, that they can have no motion, except in common with the cranium. .. Ossa Nasi. The Ossa Nasi, so named from their situation at the root of the nose, are each of an irregular ob- long square figure, being broadest at their lower end, narrowest a little higher than their middle.

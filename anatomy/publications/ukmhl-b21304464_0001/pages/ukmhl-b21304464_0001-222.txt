OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. Id4 *ome simple directions, as to the posture in which the patientâ€™s body should be kept, of very great advantage. The true vertebra are commonly divided in- to three classes, viz. cervical^ dorsal^ and lumbar. Cei'vical Vertebra. The ce?'vical*y the seven uppermost vertebray are distinguished from the rest by these marks: Their bodies are smaller and more solid than any others, and flatted on the fore-part, to make way for the (Esophagus. They are also flat behind, where small pro- cesses rise, to which the internal ligaments are fixed. The upper surface of the body of each verte- bra is made hollow, by a slanting thin process which is raised on each side : The lower surface is also excavated, but in a different manner ; for here the posterior edge is raised a little, and the ' one before is protruded a considerable way. Hence we see how the cartilages between those bones are firmly connected, and their articulations are secure. The cartilages between these vertebrae are thick, especially at their fore-part j which is one reason * colli.

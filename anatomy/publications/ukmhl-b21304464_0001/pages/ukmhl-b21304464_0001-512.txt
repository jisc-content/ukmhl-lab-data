OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 484 hind, there are two oblong large heads, whose greatest extent is backwards, for the motion of the tibia ; and from the rough cavity between them, but near to the base of the internal condyle, the strong ligament, commonly called the cross one, has its rise. A little above, which a rough protuberance gives insertion to the tendon of the triceps. On the back-part of the internal, a slight depression is made by the tendons of the gracilis and sartorius ; and on the external, such another is formed by the biceps flexor cruris; behind which, a deep fossa is to be observed, where the poplitaeus muscle has its origin. From a tubercle immediately before this cavity, a strong round ligament goes out to the upper part of the fibula. Round this lower end of the thigh-bone, large holes are found, into which the ligaments for the security of the joint are fixed, â€˜ and bloodvessels pass to the internal substance of the bone. All the processes of the femur are cartilaginous in new-born children, and afterwards become small apophyses, with large epiphyses. The thigh-bone is articulated above with the acetabulum of the ossa innominata, which affords its round head a secure and extensive play, and therefore can be moved to every side ; but is re- strained in its motion outwards, by the high brims of the cavity, and by the round ligament; for otherwise the head of the bone would have been

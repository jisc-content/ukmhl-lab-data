427 OF THE RADIUS. f ’• When the palm is turned uppermost, the radius,- is said to perform the supination ; when the back of the hand is above, it is said to be prone. But then the quickness and large extent of these two motions are assisted by the ulna, which, as was before observed, can move with a kind of small rotation on the sloping sides of the pully. This lateral motion, though very inconsiderable in the joint itself, is conspicuous at the lower end of such a long bone ; and the strong ligament con- necting this lower end to the carpus, makes the hand more readily obey these motions. When we design a large circular turn of our hand, we increase it by the rotation of the os humeri, and sometimes employ the spine and inferior extremi- ties to make these motions of propatipn or supina- tion of the hand large enough, Of the Hand. The Hand * comprehends all from the joint of the wrist to the point of the fingers. Its back- part is convex, for greater firmness and strength ; and it is concave before, for containing more surely and conveniently such bodies as we take hold of. One half of the hand has an obscure motion in comparison of what the other has, and serves as a base to the moveable half; which can be extend^ ^ summa manus.

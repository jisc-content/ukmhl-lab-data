LIGAMENTS. 77 Under the same class, the ligaments called In- terosseous, between the tibia and fibula, and the radius and ulna, which serve to unite the above bones, and to give origin to muscles, may perhaps be included. • • Thtjifth class comprehends such ligaments as form a socket, in which a mooeahk hone is lodged; as the astragalus, which is lodged within the liga- ment stretched between the os calcis and os sca- phoides. The sixth class includes those ligaments which are situated within the joints, for the sake of addi- tional security, and moderating and regulating the movements of the joints; as the round ligament of the hip-joint, and the crucial ligaments of the knee-joint. The reflections of the pciiosteum and pleura, have been described as forming, within the thorax and abdomen, ligaments for retaining the liver, spleen, uterus, and bladder of urine, in their proper situation •, and these constitute, according to some authors, a distinct class of ligaments.

The eleventh, and sometimes the tenth rib, has no tubercle for its articulation with the transverse process of the vertebra, to which it is only loosely fixed by ligaments. The fossa in its lower edge, is not so deep as in the upper ribs, because the vessels run more towards the interstice between the ribs. Its fore-end is smaller than its body, and its short small cartilage is but loosely con- nected to the cartilage of the rib above. The twelfth rib is the shortest and straightest. Its head is only articulated with the last vertebra of the thorax ; therefore is not divided into two surfaces. This rib is not joined to the transverse process of the vertebra, and therefore has no tubercle,, being often pulled necessarily inwards by the diaphragm, which an articulation with the trans- verse process would not have allowed. The fossa is not found at its under edge, be- cause the vessels run below it. The fore-part of this rib is smaller than its- middle, and has only a very small pointed carti- lage fixed to it. To its whole internal side the diaphragm is connected. The heads and tubercles of the ribs of a new born child have cartilages on them j part of

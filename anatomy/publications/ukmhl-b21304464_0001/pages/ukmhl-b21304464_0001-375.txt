OF THE LOWER JAW. 347 wards and forwards; but, like other ligaments of the joints by ginglimus, is strong and short at the sides, to confine the lateral motions. When therefore the teeth of both jaws coincide, the condyles are lodged securely in the temporal cavities, but their motions to either side must be confined both by the firmness of the ligaments, and the rising brims which are on each side of the cavities. When the jaw is brought directly forwards, the condyle and intermediate cartilages descend and advance forwards upon the tubercles. In this situation the lateral motions are a littlp more free than in the former one, from the want of rising brims to stop the condyles. When the fore-teeth of the lower jaw are mo.- ved forwards, and to one side, the condyle of the opposite side is either advanced from the cavity to the tubercle, while the condyle of the same side remains in the cavity ; or if both condyles are on the tubercles, when the jaw is moved ob- liquely to one side, the condyle of the side to which the motion is made, slides back from the tubercle to the cavity. When the mouth is opened by the descent of the lower jaw, the fore-part of it, where the depressing muscles are fixed, is drawn backwards, as well as downwards, while resistance is made to the angles moving backwards by the masseter and internal pterygoid muscles, and, at the same time, the external pterygoids draw the condyles and their mc/eable cartilages forwards; and therefore, when the mouth is opened, the con-

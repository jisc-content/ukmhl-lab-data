OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 430 The internal side, which gives the name td the bone, is in the form of a crescent, and is joined with the scaphoid ; the lower surface is hollow, for receiving part of the head of the os magnum. On the outside of this cavity is another smooth, but narrow oblong sinuosity, for receiving the up- per end of the os 'unciforme. On the outside of which a small round convexity is found, for its connexion with the os cuneiforme. Between the great convexity above, and the first deep inferior cavity, there is a rough fossa, in which the cir- cular ligament of the joint of the wrist is fixed. Of the Os Cuneiforme.! Â» The Os Cuneiforme * is broader above, and towards the back of the hand, than it is below and forwards: which gives it the resemblance of a wedge. The superior slightly convex surface is included in the joint of the wrist, being opposed to the lower end of the ulna. Below this the cuneiforme bone has a rough fossa, wherein the ligament of the articulation of the wrist is fixed. Qn the internal side of this bone, where it is con- tiguous to the os 1 unarc, it is smooth and slightly concave. Its lower surface, where it is contiguous to the os unciforme, is oblong, somewhat spiral, and con- cave. Triquetrum.

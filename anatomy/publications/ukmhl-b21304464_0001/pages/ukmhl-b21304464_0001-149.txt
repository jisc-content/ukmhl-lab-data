t , OBLIQUE MUSCLES. '121 action of the multifidus spinae, â€™which we may suppose to consist of as many short muscles as there arc true vertebrae, with the action of a single straight muscle, supposed to reach from the os sa- crum to the head, it is evident, that each of the several insertions of the multifidus spinae would, in the same times, be moved through one twenty- fourth part only of the space through which the insertion of the single long muscle must pass; and therefore, unless we suppose the insertion of the long muscle -to move twenty-four times more quickly than each of the insertions of the multi- fidus, it could not in the same time extend the trunk of the body to the same degree. .5. As the oblique muscles, in performing the same motions as straight muscles might perform, are less shortened than the straight would be, there is a saving of motion, and hence probably less fatigue. 6. Two oblique muscles, by balancing each other, may produce motions in a greater variety of directions than can be done by a pair of straight ones. In the first place, by acting singly and alter- nately, they perform the offices of straight muscles, and draw alternately the place of their insertion directly towards its origins, which are generally more distant from each other than the origins of two straight muscles. If, next, they co-operate with equal strength, the place of their insertion is moved in the dia- y

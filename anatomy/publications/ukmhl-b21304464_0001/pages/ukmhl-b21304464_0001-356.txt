Immediately on the outside of this, there is a small depression, from which the in- ferior or lesser oblique muscle of the eye has its origin *. 7« The canal on the upper part of the great tuberosity within the orbit, which is almost a complete hole ; in this a branch of the superior maxillary nerve passes. Besides these, the superior surface of the great bulge is concave, to receive the under part of the eye. Immediately above the transverse ridge in the nasal process, a small hollow is formed by the os spongiosum. In some subjects, the nasal process, has a small round pit above the lacrymal duct, w'here the little tendon or ligament of the orbicu- lar muscle of the eye-lids is inserted. It is this tendon, and not the tendon of the larger oblique muscle of the eye, which there is some hazard of cutting in the operation of the fistula lacrymalis. The holes of this bone are two proper and two common, which arc always to be found, besides several others, whose magnitude, number, &c. are uncertain. The first of the proper is the ex- ternal orbitar, immediately below the orbit, by which the infra-orbitar branch of the second branch of the fifth pair of nerves, and a small artery come out, after having passed in the canal, at the bottom of the orbit, described numb. 7. of the depressions. This hole is often double, and that when the nerve has happened to split • Winslow, Exposition Anatomique des Os Secs, § 276.

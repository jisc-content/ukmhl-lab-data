OF THE FORM OF THE SKULL. S6l several generations, has at length become heredi- tary ; and constitutes the national peculiarity. Of the Changes in Size a?td Shape which the Head undergoes during the different stages of Hydro- cephalus Chronic us. The changes in size and shape which the head undergoes during the different stages of hydroce- phalus chronicus, also afford a striking illustration of the influence of the brain upon the form of the skull, and also of the effect of posture and pressure. In consequence of this disease, the head soon acquires a preternatural size * and form. Before proceeding to endeavour to explain the form of the skull in the different stages of hydroce- phalus chronicus, it may not be improper to ob- serve, that when the forehead is naturally very prominent, as we observe in some families, it be- comes very remarkably so from hydrocephalus chronicus f. The uniform and equal groxvth of every part of the bones of the brain-case may be stinted, or its shape distorted by posture. * I have^een the skull of a person who died from hydroce- phalus, whieh measured fifty inches in eircumferenee, + Vid. Case which I published in Dr Duncanâ€™s Annals of Medicine for 1803.^

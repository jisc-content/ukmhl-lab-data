OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. ^0 Fa’tal Bones. The foetal bones, which are much more nume- rous than those of the adult, exhibit a fibrous structure, more or less distinctly, in the interstices of which the bloodvessels are situated. The fibres are formed upon membranes, as in the head ; or within a jelly, as in the extremities of tlie body, and issue from centres of ossification. Upon examining with attention what takes place in the earlier stages of ossification, we observe small grains, deposited in an irregular manner, which are gradually united, so as to form fine fibres ; which fibres are disposed differently in dift'crent bones, and become more numerous, and form a sort of network. The fibres are more numerous and more closely compacted towards the middle of the bones; hence a centre or centres of ossification have been described. New strata, are added to the upper and under surfaces of the original stratum, and form the layers of the bones. The process of ossification is by no means uni- form as to its progress in the diff erent bones of the skeleton: it is soonest completed -in those bones which form the parietes of the cavities contain- ing organs which are essential to life, and whose functions • might have been interrupted by pres-

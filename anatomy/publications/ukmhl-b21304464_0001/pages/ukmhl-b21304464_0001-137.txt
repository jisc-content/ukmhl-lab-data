109 oblique muscles. 8\ippOSe these to form diagonals to right-angled triangles, the bases of such triangles, compared â€¢with the perpendiculars, will be very nearly in the proportion of 3 to 4; or the muscular fibres form, with their bases and perpendiculars, tri- angles, the sides of which are in proportion to each otherj as the numbers 5, 4, &- 3. From the increase of strength which many muscles gain by having their fibres made shorter, though laid in an oblique direction, it was univer- sally supposed by authors, that the increase of force was the only purpose served by the obliquity of their fibres. 4. But to shew you, in the clearest manner, that nature may have other very different purposes in view, it will be found, that, in various instances, the strength of the muscle is diminished by the obliquity of its fibres. This is the case of many of the short muscles attached to the spine, as in the semi-spinalis colli et dorsi, multifidus spipae, &.C. But the most striking instance of this is to be found in the intercostal muscles. For it is evi- dent, that if their fibres had been straight or perpendicular to the ribs, they would have been not only much more numerous than in the oblique position, but would have acted upon the ribs with greater force.

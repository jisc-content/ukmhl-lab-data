The ridge between these' two cavities of the os unguis, is the proper boun-‘ dary of the orbit at its internal canthus ; and be- yond which surgeons should not proceed backwards in performing operations here. The internal or posterior surface of this bone consists of a furrow in the middle of two convexities. ‘ The substance of the os unguis is as thin as paper, and very brittle ; it is easily pierced in living subjects. Each of these bones is joined, above, to the fron- tal bone, by part of the transverse suture ; behind,_ to the os planum of the ethmoid bone, by the same suture; before, and below, to the maxillary bone, by the lacrymal suture. Internally, the ossa unguis cover some of the sinus ethmoidales ; nay, are really continuous with the bony lamellae which niake up the sides of these cells; so that they are as niuch part of the ethmoid bone, as the ossa plana. These unguiform bones compose the anterior internal parts ol the orbits, lodge a share of the^ lacrymal sac and duct, and cover the ethmoid cells. Their situation and tender substance, make a rash operator in danger of destroying a consi- derable share of the organ of smelling, when he is performing the operation of the fistula lacrymalis;

OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. f04 bridge, that goes between the cervical vein and artery, than any of the other vertebrae. Dorsal Vertebra:. The twelve dorsal^, may be distinguished from the other vertebrae of the spine by the following marks. Their bodies are of a middle size, betwixt those of the neck and loins ;—they are more convex before than either of the other two sorts ; and are flattened laterally by the pressure of the ribs, which are inserted into small cavities formed in their sides. This flattening on their sides, which makes the figure of these vertebrae almost an half oval, is of good use ; as it affords a firm articulation to the ribs, allows the trachea arteria to divide at a small angle, and the other large vessels to run se- cure from the action of the vital organs. • These bodies are more concave behind, than any of the other two classes. Their.upper and lower surfaces are horizontal. The cartilages interposed between the bodies of these vertebrae are thinner than in any other of the true vertebree ; and contribute to the concavity of the spine in the thorax, by being thinnest at their fore-part. The oblique processes are placed almost perpen- dicular the upper ones slanting but a little for- • luTtVp antistemi, pectoris, tergi.

OF THE SHAPE OF THE SKULL. S67 the Other remained of its natural capacity, and con- tained hardly any water. This appearance, I should however impute not to the obliteration or obstruction of the communication between the lateral ventriclesj but to one side of the brain being more affected with disease, more flaccid and tender than the other; in consequence of which, a greater exudation had taken place from the vessels of this part, and the sides of the ven- tricle had yielded more readily to the pressure of the water, as it was effused.‚Äù Such, in general, is the state of the head in the first stage of hydrocephalus chronicus; but it is proper to remark, that cases occur where some parts of the head are below the level of the others, which is probably owing to the ossification not be- ing completed at those places. During the progress of the disease, the head exhibits many striking varieties as to form and size. It never preserves^ its natural form. It ac- quires an unusual breadth ; but especially at those parts which correspond with the centres of ossification of the parietal bones, and also in the forehead. The effusion of a watery liquor into the cavi- ties of the brain, which takes place to a greater or less degree in different instances, produces these effects *. I The undulation of a fluid witliin the head, niay be distinctly perceived at the sutures, if the watery liquor has been effused between the membranes of the brain; nav, even where it is cf-

530 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. * Vid. Plate 2. By the weight of the body, the leg is bent for- wards on the foot; to obviate which, there are three very powerful extensor muscles which com- pose the calf of the leg, and which act upon the foot by the medium of the tendo Achillis. Bi-Femoralis Calcaneus, or Gastrocnemius, This muscle consists of two strong heads, which are connected with the upper and back parts of the condyles of the thigh-bone ; a little below, the fleshy bellies are united in a middle tendon, which is joined to that of the following muscle. Tibio-Calcaneus, or Soleus. This compound penniform muscle * rises from the posterior and upper surface of the tibia and fibula. The flesh of this muscle is covered by the tendon of the former muscle. Femori-Calcaneus, or the Plantaris. This muscle arises from the upper and back part of the external condyle of the thigh-bone, and from the capsular ligament of the joint. From the muscle, a thin tendon descends be- tween the inner heads of the gastrocnemii muscles, which is fixed into the inner edge of the tendo Achillis, and into the posterior part of the os calcis.

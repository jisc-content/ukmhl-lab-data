OF THE SPINE. 221 that, is made flat and rough where the sacrolum- balis and longissimus dorsi rise; and to its outside are fixed ligaments, extended to the os sacrum and transverse processes of the fifth and fourth verte- hrce of the loins Below the anterior spinal process another protu- berance stands out, which, by its situation, may be distinguished from th^former, 'by adding the epi- thet of vif erior, where the musculus rectus tibiae f has its origin Besides these two anterior processes the bone is hollowed where the beginning of the sartorius muscle is lodged. Below the posterior spinal pro- cess, a second protuberance of the edge of this hone is in like manner observable, which is close- ly applied to the os sacrum. , Under this last pro- cess a considerable large niche is observable in the os ilium; between the sides of which and the strong ligament that is stretched over from the os^ sacrum to the sharp-pointed process of the os is- chium of the recent subject, a large hole is for- med, through which the musculus pyriformis, the great sciatic nerve, and the posterior crural ves- sels pass, and are protected from compression. The external broad side or dorsum of the os ilium is a little hollow towards the fore-part; far- ther back it is as much raised ; then is consider- ably concave, and lastly, it is convex.

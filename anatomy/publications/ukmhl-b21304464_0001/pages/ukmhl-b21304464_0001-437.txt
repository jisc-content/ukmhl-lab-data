401) OF THE SCAPULA. rises ; and from the lower one, the coracobrachia- lis has its origin. At the upper part of the root of this process, immediately before the semilunar cavity, a smooth tubercle appears, where a liga- ment from the clavicle is fixed. From all the ex- ternal side of this coracoid apophyse, a broad li- gament goes out, which becomes narrower where it is fixed to the acromion. The sharp pain, vio- lent inflammation, and tedious cure of contusions in this part, are probably owing to these tendons and ligaments being hurt. From the cervix scapulae the third process is produced. The fore-part of this is formed into a glenoid cavity *, which is of the shape of the longitudinal section of an egg, being broad below, and narrow above. Between the brims of this hollow and the fore-part of the root of the spine, a large sinuosity is left, for the transmission of the supra and infra spinati muscles; and on the upper part of these brims we may remark a smooth sur- face, where the second head of the biceps flexor cubiti has its origin. The root of the supercilia is rough all round, for the firmer adhesion of the capsular ligament of the articulation, and of the cartilage which is placed on these brims, where it is thick, but becomes very thin as it is continued towards the middle of the cavity, which it line? all over.

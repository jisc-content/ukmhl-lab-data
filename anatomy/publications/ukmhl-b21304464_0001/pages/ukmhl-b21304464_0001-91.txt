Si con-ferant, certe conferunt nudto minus quam periostei vasa I There are many instances in which ossification must take place independently of the periosteum. The ossification of the extremities of the bones which are in a state of epiphysis, begins in the very centre of the seeming cartilage; and the same takes place in the knee-pan, and in many cases of disease. The above opinion gains weight, on considering in what manner the medullary canal increases in diameter. In many instances of preternatural ossification, the periosteum can have no share in that process. 1 have had occasion to meet with several instances in which a considerable part of the medullary matter of the drain has been converted into bone ; and with one case where the greater part of the muscular flesh of the /lear^ had undergone a simi- lar change. I have also met with three cases where a part of the substance of t\iQ placenta has been reduced to a state of bone. * Vid. Thesis, p. 94, 95, 96.

OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 34.8 dyles are carried forwards upon the tubercles, and the axis of motion of the bone is a little above its angles. But in this situation there is less re- sistance, than in any other, to the condyles luxa- ting forwards ; an accident which seldom hap- pens, except when people are gaping too wide; and therefore the common practice of nurses, who support the jaw of infants when they are yawning, is reasonable. In chewing there is a succession of the motions above described. Wherever moveable cartilages are found in joints, either the articulated bones are of such a figure, or so joined and fixed by their ligaments, that little motion would be allowed without such cartilages ; or else some motions are necessary to the right use of the member, which the form of the articulation would not otherwise admit of. This will more fully appear after the other joints with such cartilages are described. In a child borne to the full time, the lower jaw is composed of two bones, connected by a thin car- tilage in the middle of the chin, which gradually ossifies, and the two bones intimately unite. In each of these bones there are five or six sockets for teeth as in the upper jaw. From the preceding description of the teeth, the insertion of so many muscles of the tongue, and of the os hyoides, the connexion of the mem- brane of the tongue to the maxillary bone, and the motions of this bone ; it is evident that the

90 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY- the superior and inferior extremities, are condu- cive to the symmetry of the body, and particularly to that of the limbs, and also to the defence of the muscles. 4///, The tendinous aponeuroses not only defend the muscles, but increase greatly the surfaces from whicli the muscular fibres take their origin; of which there are many examples in the back, and in the extremities of the body, in tiie fore-arms, thighs and legs; and in some places there are two or more muscles, the fibres of which are different- ly directed, and subservient to different purposes, taking their origin from the opposite sides of the same tendinous membrane. 5//i, There are rounded tendinous cords, which serve to connect muscles to distant bones, where there is not room for the bellies of all the muscles which are necessary for the motions of the joints; and without such a medium of attachment, the joints must have been unwieldy and of great bulk, and there might have been the risk of the muscles interfering with each other, or of the muscles proving injurious to the neighbouring bloodvessels and nerves. 6V/i,â€™ There are annular tendinous ligaments, as at the wrists and ankles, which serve to fix down the round tendons, and to strengthen the bursae within which the tendons play. Lastly, Some tendons fix down other tendons ; thus the tendons of the long flexor muscles of the fingers and toes pass through each other.

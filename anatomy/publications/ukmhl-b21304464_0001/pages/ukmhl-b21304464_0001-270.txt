242 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. Of the peculiarities of the Ribs. In viewing the ribs from above downwards, their figure is still straighter ; the uppermost being the most crooked of any. Their obliquity in re- spect of the spine increases as they descend ; so that though their distances from each other is very little different at their back-part, yet at their fore- ends the distances between the lower ones must in- crease. In consequence of this increased obliquity of the lower ribs, each of their cartilages makes a greater curve in its progress from the rib towards the sternum ; and the tubercles, that are articula- ted to the transverse processes of the vertebrae, have their smooth surfaces gradually facing more upwards. From the ribs becoming thus more ob- lique, while the sternum advances forwards in its descent, the distance between the sternum and the anterior end of the lower ribs is greater than be- tween the sternum and the ribs above ; consequent- ly the cartilages of those ribs that are joined to the breast-bone are longer in the lower than in the higher -ones. These cartilages are placed nearer to each other as the ribs descend, which occasions the curvature of the cartilages to be greater. The length of the ribs increases from the first and uppermost rib, as far down as the seventh; and from that to the twelfth, as gradually dimi- Â» nishes.

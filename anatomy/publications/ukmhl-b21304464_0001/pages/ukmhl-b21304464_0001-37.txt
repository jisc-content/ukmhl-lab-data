OSTEOLOGY. 9 - lation betweh the joint, and the muscles which move it; thus, there is ball and socket for admitting of free motion in every direction ; hinge-joints, where flexion and extension only are necessary j and these joints are more or less secure in different parts of the body ; thus^ the socket at the hip-joint is much deeper than at the shoulder, as the inferior extremities are subservient not to locomotion only, but also to the support of the body. 6. The bones of the skeleton are said to be disposed symmetrically, by which it is meant to be implied, that there is an exact correspondency of the opposite sides; for by a vertical plane from before, backward, the skeleton may be di- vided into two equal and similar parts. But the above observation should be received with some limitation, for in many instances the opposite bones are not exactly similar to each other, and in many cases one bone inclines more to one side than the other corresponding to it. 7. From the position of the skull and pelvis, from the width of the latter, the dispropor- tion in the length of the superior and inferior extremities, and the very different structure of the joints of these parts, it is evident that man is intended to be a biped. 8. The bones of the human skeleton are so placed with respect to one another, that, when put into their natural situation, scarcely any one of them is placed in a perpendicular bearing to an-i

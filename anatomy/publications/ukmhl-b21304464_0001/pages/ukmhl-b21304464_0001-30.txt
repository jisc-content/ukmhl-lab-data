OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. a CHAPTER I. GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE COISI- ,POSITION OF THE HUMAN BODY. X HE human body is composed of Solids and Fluids, which may be separated from one another by various means, as by exsiccation, or expres- sion. The solids have been arranged under two classes ; the hard and soft. Under the first class, the Bones and Cartilages are included ; and un- der the second, the Muscles, Viscera, Nerves, and all the other parts. The solids, when mechanically divided, are found to consist of Layers, Fibres, and Fila- ments. Cellular substance, or cdlulosily, envelopes, per- vades, and seems to form the basis of the den- ser parts. In membranes there is a good deal of compact, or condensed, cellular substance; and the Vessels are membranes, rounded into cylin- ders, with the addition of muscular fibres.

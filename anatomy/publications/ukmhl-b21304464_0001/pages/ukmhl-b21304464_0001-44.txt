OUTLINES or ANATOMY. 16 Varieties of the form, size, situation, and uses of the Bones. There is a considerable difference with regard to the magnitude, figure, situation, connection, and uses of the bones. The bones may be arranged under three classes, —the broad, the cylindrical, and those of an iri'e- gular figure. Many bones have protuberances, or p?'occsscs *, rising out of them. If a process stands out in a roundish ball, it is called caput, or head. If the head is flattened, it obtains the appellation of con- dyle. A rough unequal protuberance, is called tuberosity. When a process rises narrow, and then becomes large, the narrow or small part is named cervix, or neck. Long ridges of bones, are called spines. Such processes as terminate in a sharp point, have the general name of coronce f, or coronoid, bestowed on them, though most of them receive particular names, from the resemblance they have, or are imagined to have, to other substances, e. g. mastoid, styloid, anchoroid, coracoid, spinal, ^'c. Such processes as form brims of cavities, are called supercilia |. * *Awo(pus-l»5, ExCCSSUS, ex- ylanatio, tuberculum, gibbus, eminentia, productio, extuberan- tia, projectura, enascentia. • t Rostra, glandcs. ^ “'Yrvts, aipgve?, LabWl. 1

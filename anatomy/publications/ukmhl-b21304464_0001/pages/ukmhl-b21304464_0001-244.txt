216 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. Os Coccygis.—Os Coccygis or rump-bone, is that triangular chain ol bones depending from the os sacrum ; each bone becoming smaller as they descend, till the last ends almost in a point. The os coccygis is convex behind, and concave before; from which crooked pyramidal figure, which was thought to resemble a cuckow’s beak, it has got its name. This bone consists of four pieces in people of middle age : In children, very near the whole of it is cartilage : In old subjects, all the bones are united, and become frequently one continued bone with the os sacrum. The highest of the four bones is the largest^ with shoulders extended farther to each side than the end of the os sacrum ; which enlargement should, in my opinion, serve as a distinguishing mark to fix the limits of either bone. The upper surface of this bone is a little hollow. From the back of that bulbous part called its shoulders, a process often rises up on each side, to jojn with the bifurcated spine of the fourth and fifth bones of the os sacrum, to form the bony bridge men- tioned in the description of the os sacrum. Some- times these shoulders are joined to the sides of the fifth bone of the os sacrum, to form the hole in each side common to these two bones, for the ' passage of the twenty-ninth pair ot spinal nerves. * O^(07rvyi»’, caudae os, spondylium, os cuculi.

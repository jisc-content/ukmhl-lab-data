In a ripe child, the spine of the os ilium is car- tilaginous, and is afterwards joined to the bone in form of an epiphysis *. The large lower end of this bone is not completely ossified. Os Ischium. Os Ischium f, or hip-bone, is of a middle bulk between the two other parts of \he os innominatum ; is situated lowest of the three, and is of a very ir- regular figure. Its extent might be marked by an horizontal line drawn nearly through the middle of the acetabulum ; for the upper bulbous part of this bone forms somewhat less than the lower half of that great cavity, and the small leg of it rises to much the same height on the other side of the great hole common to this bone and the os pubis. Processes.—From the upper part of the os is- chium, a sharp process, called by some spinous, stands out backwards, from which chiefly the musculus coccygaeus and superior gemellus, and part of the levator ani, rise ; and the interior or internal sacrosciatic ligament is fixed to it. * Vid.

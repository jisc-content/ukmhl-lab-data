OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 480 room ; for had the knees been at a greater dis- tance from each other, we must have been obliged to describe some part of a circle with the trunk of our body in making a long step, and, when one leg was raised from the ground, our centre of gra- vity would have been too far from the base of the other, and we should consequently have been in hazard of falling ; so that our steps would neither have been straight nor firm ; nor would it have been possible to walk in a narrow path, had our thigh-bones been otherwise placed*. This end is formed into a large smooth round head f, which is the greater portion of a sphere unequally divided. Towards its lower internal part, a round rough spongy pit is observable, where the strong liga- ment, commonly, but unjustly, called the round one, is fixed, to be extended from thence to the lower internal part of the receiving cavity, where it is considerably broader than near to the head of the thigh-bone. The small part below the head, called the cervixj of the os fern oris, has a great many large holes, into which the fibres of the strong ligament, * The form of the thigh-bone, and also the angle tvhich the body of that bone makes with its head, are materially different in the ricketty and healthy child. In the former, the head and neck of the bone form with its body a right angle, having yield- ed to the weight of the body. Hence, a ricketty child straddles in an unnatural manner in walking or running. f Vertebrum.

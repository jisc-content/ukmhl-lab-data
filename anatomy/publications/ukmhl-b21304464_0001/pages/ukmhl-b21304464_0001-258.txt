230 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. * Coxae, coxendicis. OS ilium makes something less than two-fifths, and the os ischium asâ€˜much more than two-fifths. The brims of this cavity are very high, and are still much more enlarged by the ligamentous car- tilage, with which they are tipped in a recent sub- ject. From this form of the cavity it has beep called acetabulum; and for a distinguishing cha- racter, the name of the bone that constitutes the largest share of it is added ; therefore acetabulum ossis ischii *, is the name this cavity commonly bears. Round the base of the supercilia, the bone is rough and unequal, where the capsular liga- ment of the articulation is fixed. The brims at the upper and back-part of the acetabulum^ are much larger and higher, than anywhere else; which is very necessary to prevent the head of the femur from slipping out of its cavity at this place, where the whole weight of the body bears upon it, and consequently would otherwise be constant- ly in danger of thrusting it out. As these brims are extended downwards and forwards, they become less ; and at their internal lower part a breach is made in^ them ; from the one side of which to the other, a ligament is placed in the recent subject; under which a large hole is left, which contains fat, cellular substance and vessels. The reason of which appearance has afforded matter of debate. To me it seems evi- dently contrived for allowing a larger motion to

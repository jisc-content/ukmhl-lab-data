For, by hypothesis, the fibres being uniformly disposed in each, there is not any fibre in either bone that has not a corresponding fibre ; the sum of both, whose distances from the axis of revolution (about which all the parts of the bone must revolve in breaking) is equal to two semi- diameters of the bone ; Consequently each fibre, and all the fibres, may be regarded as resisting at the distance of one semidiameter or radius from this axis, that is, in the centre. 3. Since the united force of all the fibres is to be regarded as resisting at a distance from the centre of motion equal to the semidiameter, it fol- lows, that the total resistance of all these fibres, or the strength of the bone, is proportional to its semidiameter, and consequently to its diameter. I have here taken for an example, one of the most simple cases for calculating the proportional forces of bones. But, were it not too foreign to the present design, it might be universally de- monstrated, that, of whatever figure bones are, and in whatever manner their fibres are disposed, their strength must always be in a ratio, compounded of the area of their transverse sections, or of their quantity of bony matter, and of the distance of the centre of gravity of these sections, from the centre of motion or fulcrum, on which the bone is sup- posed to turn when broken *. * See the demonstration of this theorem by Dr Porterfield in

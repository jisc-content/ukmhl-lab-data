OF THE OSSA PARIETALIA. 279 ing furrows, like so many radii drawn from a cir- cumference towards a centre. From this ridge of each bone the temporal muscle rises ; and, by the pressure- of its fibres, occasions the furrows just now mentioned. Below these, we observe, near the semicircular edges, a great many risings and depressions, which are joined to like inequalities on the inside of the temporal bone, to form the squamous suture. The temporal bone may there- fore serve here as a buttress, to prevent the lower side of the parietal from starting outwards when its upper part is pressed or struck Near the upper sides of these bones, towards the hind part, is a small hole in each, through which a vein passes from the teguments of the head to the longitudinal sinus. Sometimes I have seen a branch of the temporal artery pass through this hole, to be distributed to the upper part of the falx, and to the dura mater at its sides, where it had frequent anastomoses with the branches of the arteries derived from the external carotids, which commonly have the name of the arteries of the dura mater, and with the branches of the internal carotids which serve the falx. In several skulls, one of the ossa parietalia has not this hole; in others, there are two in one bone ; and in some not one in either. Most frequently this hole is through both tables; at other times the external table only is perforated. The knowledge of the * Hunauld in Mem. clc Iâ€™Acad. dcs Sciences, 3 730. S4

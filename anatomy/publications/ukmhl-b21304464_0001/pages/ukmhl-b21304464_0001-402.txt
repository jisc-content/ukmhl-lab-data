OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 374 though in the adult it consists only of one bone ; and it holds true with regard to the bones which surround the cavities of the nose, of the orbits *, and also respecting the bony part of the mouth. Upon examining the under surface of the skull, the above observation also holds true, as may be seen by drawing a line from the more promi- nent part of the os occipitis, through the middle of the foramen magnum, ossis occipitis, and the bony palate, to the most prominent part of the upper jaw f. It would lead to a very long detail, entirely foreign to the object of mere Outlines on Anatomy, to point out all the defects as to the symmetry of the skull; many of which are obvious in the sub- joined plates. I shall therefore content myself, by submitting to the reader, a machine by which these varieties in the form of the skulls, may be observed, and represented with truth upon paper. The machines which have been employed for measuring the different angles of skulls, are imper- •fect, and may on some occasions mislead ; for it is evident, that any little rising of the skull must alter the angle, which is taken by a wooden or metallic ruler, laid along the most prominent part of the os frontis and os maxillare superius, and •crossed by another laid horizontally across the * There is no part of the skull which is so different as to its form, as the orbit *. That of the Hottentot very much resembles the orbit of the Chinese. t Vid. Plate xx. A. f Yidf plates 18th, 19th, and 80th.

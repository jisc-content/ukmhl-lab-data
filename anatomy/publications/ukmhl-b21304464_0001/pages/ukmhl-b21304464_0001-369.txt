OF THE VOMER. S41 ly united to the vomer by the little processes piercing into its substance, as to prevent any se- paration ; on which account it has been esteemed by some * a part of the ethmoid bone. The mid- dle cartilage of the nose fills up what remains of the fossa at its fore-part. The posterior edge of the vomer, which appears above the back-part of the palate-bones, is broad- er above.; but as it descends forwards, becomes thinner, though it is still solid and firm. The lower edge of this bone, which rests on the nasal spine of the palate and maxillary bones, has a lit- tle furrow on each side of a small middle ridge, answering to the spines of the bones of different sides, and the interstice between them. This edge, and the upper one meet in the pointed fore-end of this bone. The body of the vomer has a smooth surface, and solid, but thin substance ; and towards its sides, where it is thickest, some cancetli may be observed, when the bone is broken. It is joined above to the sphenoid and ethmoid bones, and to the middle cartilage of the nose, by schindylesis; below, to the maxillary and' palate bones, by the spinous suture. The vomer divides the nostrils, enlarges the organ of smelling, by allowing place for expand- ing the membrane of the nose on its sides, and * Vesalius, Santorini, Petit in his edition of Palfvnâ€™s Anatomy ; and also Lieutaud, have described this bone as a part of the ethmoid bone; and Vidus Vidius, as a part of th(? sphenoid bone.

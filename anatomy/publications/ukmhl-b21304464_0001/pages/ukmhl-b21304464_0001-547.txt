FASCIA OF THE INFERIOR EXTREMITY. 519 vessels which appear like lines of a whitish colour, and enter the inguinal lymphatic glands, at the up- per and inner part of the thigh. This fascia is connected to the crural arch, with the sacro-sciatic ligaments, if the tendons of the glutaeus maximus, and tensor vaginae femoris, \Vith the linea aspera, condyles of the thigh-bone, and patella, and is attached also to the upper parts r of the tibia and fibula, and being continued, forms the fascia of the leg. The fascia of the leg is connected to every pro- jecting part of the bones, becoming thinner to- wards the under part of the leg, and where it passes over the ancle. It forms a strong annular or transverse ligament, which extends from the outer ancle and neighbouring part of the os calcis, and is fixed to the malleolus internus, and os na- viculare. This ligament binds down the tendons of the extensor muscles. There is a muscle proper to the upper part of the fascia, called Ilio-Femoralis, or Tensor Vagina; Pemoris. This muscle arises from the external part of the anterior superior spinous process of the os ilium, and is fixed into the fascia, where it co- vers the upper and outer side of the thigh, a little below the trochanter major. - â–

474 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY* joint; it is connected with the lower end of the os humeri, and fixed around the edge of the arti- cular surface of the ulna, and also to the coronary ligament of the radius. On each side of the capsular ligaments, there are lateral ligaments^ the internal, or humero-ulnar^ passing between the internal condyle of the os humeri, and the coronoid process of the ulna, and the external, or humero-radiaU which is larger than the other, extending between the external condyle of the os humeri, and the accessory liga- ment. There is an annular ligament, which encircles the neck of the radius, and is fixed to the oppo- site sides of the semilunar cavity of the ulna. By this ligament, the radius is fixed down, dur- ing the pronation and supination of the hand. There are a number of additional ligamentous fibres which pass over the capsular ligament in different directions, and have been named acces- sory ligaments. Sect. III. LIGAMENTS BETWEEN THE RADIUS AND ULNA. THERE is a Strong ligamentous membrane, ex- tending between the sharp ridges of the radius and ulna, the fibres of which extend obliquely down- wards and inwards.

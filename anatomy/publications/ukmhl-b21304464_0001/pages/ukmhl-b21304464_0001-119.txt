91 MYOLOGY. Classification of Muscles. There have been two methods of arranging the muscles. According to the one, muscles are' ar- ranged according to their uses ; according to the other from their situation. The latter is the me- thod of Albinos, which has been adopted by most of the modern anatomists. Such a method is perhaps the most natural, and most favourable for teaching dissection, but it communicates a very imperfect idea of their uses, pnd of the mode in which they antagonize each other. I propose to adopt both plans, viz. to name the muscles as they present upon dissection, and then to arrange them into classes, according to their se- veral uses. i ^ Nomenclature of Muscles. The muscles of the human body have been named by Douglas, Albinus, Innes, and other authors, from their size*, breadthf, and length:}:, form % their being straight |j, or oblique ยง, from * Greater and smaller pectoral muscle. + Latissimus dorsi.

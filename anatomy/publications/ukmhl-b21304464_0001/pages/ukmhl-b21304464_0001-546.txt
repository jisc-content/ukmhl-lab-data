OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 518 Sect. II. OF THE TENDINOUS APONEUROSIS OF THE IN- FERIOR EXTREMITY, AND MUSCLE PRO- PER TO IT. At present it is proposed to describe in very general terms the tendinous aponeurosis of the in- ferior extremity. The fascia of the thigh, which has been called fascia lata, is made up partly of tendinous, and partly of ligamentous fibres. It is smooth on its external surface, and consi- derably thicker on the outer than on the inner side of the thigh, and it not only covers, but also enters between the muscles of the thigh. The upper part of this fascia, which is very intimately interwoven with the crural arch, (in a manner to be afterwards more fully described), is covered by a very thin tendinous fascia, called the .glandular fascia. The large vein, called vena saphana major, runs between the fascia lata and the skin, and sinks beneath a crescent-like jold of fascia, to join the deep femoral vein. There are many small nerves which ramify above this fascia of the thigh, which are derived from the lumbar and anterior crural nerve; and also a nuinber of lymphatic glands, and lymphatic

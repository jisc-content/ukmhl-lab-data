358 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. period : hence tlie bones, which are not so hard aS in advanced life, more readily receive and retain the impressions of the convolutions, and other pro- jecting parts of the brain, and are so impressed by these, that, by an attentive examination, it is easy to determine, what part of the skull has been most acted on. Thus, upon comparing the top with the base of the skull, the latter is found very unequal in its surface, as it not only resists the extension of the brain, but also supports its weight. Further, these impressions in the base of the skull become deeper during the progress of life. As general pressure produces so manifest a change upon the form of the skull, pressure par- tially applied^ may also lead to the distortion of the skull) and hence the skull will be expanded in the direction to which the head is inclined. The brain of a child, by particular posture, pres- ses more on the one part of the skull than the other. If the head be unequally balanced on the spine, it wdll expand in the direction to which it inclines, and one side of the skull becomes con- siderably more capacious than the other. This may arise from an awkward way of standing, from one leg being longer than the other, from wry neck, or any other cause which keeps the head constantly inclined to one side. Dr Camper has published the case of a young woman, which shews clearly the effect of pressure : his patient carried her head to one side, so that

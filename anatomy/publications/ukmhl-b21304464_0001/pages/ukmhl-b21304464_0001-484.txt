OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 4S6 * Vid. Plate xxii. A. left arm. A Of the Flexor Muscles. Scapulo-Radialis, or Biceps Flexor Cubiti This muscle has two origins, one in common with the coraco-brachialis, from the coracoid pro- cess of the scapula, and the other, the longer, from the upper-part of the glenoid cavity ; the longer- head passes over the ball of the os humeri within the joint, and it is retained by a ligament within a groove in the upper-part of the os humeri ; and is fixed into a small tubercle on the upper and inner side of the radius, and into the aponeurosis of the fore-arm. By this muscle the fore-arm is bent, the hand is turned supine, and the fascia is tightened *. Humero-Ulnaris, or Brachialis Internus. This muscle takes its rise from the lower third of the anterior part of the os humeri; and it passes over the joint adhering to the capsular ligament, and is fixed into the coronoid process of the ulna.

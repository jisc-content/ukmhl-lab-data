We may lay it down as a general rule, notwith- standing some exceptions. That the bodies of the 'cej'tebra are smaller, and more solid above, but as they descend, they appear larger and more spongy ; and that the cartilages between them are thick, and the surrounding ligaments strong in proportion . to the largeness of the vertebrtz, and to the quantity of motion they perform: By which disposition, the greater weight is supported on the broadest best secured base, and the middle of our body is allowed a large and secure motion. Processes.â€”From each side of the body of each vertebra^ a bony bridge is produced backwards, and to a side ; from the posterior end of which, one slanting process rises and another descends ; the smooth, and what is generally the flattest side of each of these four processes, which are called the oblique is covered with a smooth cartilage ; and the two lower ones of each vertebra are fitted to, and articulated with the two upper or ascending oblique processes of the ^vertebra below, having their articular ligaments fixed into the rough line round their edges. From between the oblique processes of each side * Articulatoril, minuai.

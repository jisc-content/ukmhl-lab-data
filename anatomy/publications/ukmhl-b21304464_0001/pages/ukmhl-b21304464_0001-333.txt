OF THE OS ETHMOIDES. 305 bit of the eyes and septum narium ; while all its parts are so light as not to be in hazard of separat- ing by their weight; and they are so thin, as to form a large surface, without occupying much space. This brittle substance, however, is suffi- ciently protected from external injuries by the firm bones which cover it. On account of the structure of this bone, an ozaena is difficult to cure ; and from violent scur- vies, or the lues venefea, the fabric of the nose, the eyes, and life itself are in danger. The situation of the nasal plate may shew us, how dangerous a fracture of the bones of the nose may be, when made by a force applied to their middle fore-part, of a person in whom this nasal plate is perpendi- cular. *. The ethmoid bone of ripe children is divided into two, by a perpendicular cartilage, which, when ossified, is the crista galli, and nasal plate. Os Sphenoides.

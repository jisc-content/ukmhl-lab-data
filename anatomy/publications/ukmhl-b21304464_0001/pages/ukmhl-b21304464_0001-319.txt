OF THE OS OCCIPITIS. 29 i Os Occipitis. The Os Occipitis *, so called from its situation^ is convex on the outside, and concave internally. Its figure is an irregular square, or rather rhom- boid j of which the angle above is generally a little rounded ; the two lateral angles are more finished, but obtuse ; and the lower one is stretch- ed forward in form of a wedge, and thence is cal- led by some the cuneiform process. If one would, however, be very nice in observing the several turns which the edges of the os occipitis make, five or seven sides, and as many angles of this bone, might be described. The external surface is convex, except at the cuneiform apophyse, where it is flatted. At the base of this triangular process, on each side of the great hole, but more advanced for- wards than the middle of it, the large oblong pro- tuberances, named the condyles, appear, to serve for the articulation of this bone with the first ' vertebra of the neck. The smooth surface of each of these condyloid processes is longest from behind forwards, where, by their oblique situation, they come much near- er to each other than they are at their back-part. Their inner sides are lower than the external, by which they are prevented from sliding to either * "hor, Basilare, prorÂ®, memoria?, pixidis, fibrosunij nervosum, lambdc. T 2

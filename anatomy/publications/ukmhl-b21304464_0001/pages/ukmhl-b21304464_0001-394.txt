In another case, one side of the os frontis is much more prominent than the other, and to such a de- gree, that if the profiles of both sides of the head were taken, no one would imagine them to repre- sent different views of the same head : the one re- sembles the profile of a child whose head is a little larger than usual; whereas the other, from the forehead being very prominent, bears all the cha- racters of the head of a child labouring under hy- drocephalus chronicus. May not the above fact be attributed to a larger quantity of water being effused on one side of the head than the other; the cause of which has been well explained in the following letter from my ingenious colleague Dr Rutherford, to my Father ; “ I have seen,” says he, “ one of the ven- tricles much enlarged and full of water, while

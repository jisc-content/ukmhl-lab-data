OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. ‘316 is div' by authors, into the upper and lower maxillae or jaws *. * The bones of the face are considerably larger in the adult, in proportion to those of the cranium, than in the infant. In some Negroes, the upper and under jaws are, much more prominent than in the European *. The bones of the jaws of some Negroes are more prominent than those of others, and the jaws of most of the simia tribe are still more prominent than those of the Negro. Upon the above fact, Dr Camper has grounded his method of distinguishing national peculiarities as to the form of skulls, and has endeavoured to establish a regular gradation between them. But the above method of estimating the differences in skulls o different nations is imperfect; for it points out only those dis- tinctions which result from the degrees of prominence of the jaws; and it is liable also to insuperable objections ; for there are skulls of different nations which have the same prominence of the jaws, but which are very different in other respects, and, on the other hand, there are also crania which agree in most respects as to form, but the jaws of such cranium are widely different as to the degree of prominence, and of course as to the direction of the facial line. Beside, there are many of the nations inhabiting different parts of Africa, whose head in form resembles that of the Euro^ peanj for instance, the skull of the Hottentot (which now lies before me) differs from that of the European only as to the small size of the orbits. The Caffre, I have been informed, exactly re- sembles the European as to the form of the head; and Dr Win- TEHBOTTOM, in liis account of Sierra Leone, has observed, “ the sloping contracted fore-head, small eyes, depressed nose, and projecting jaw, with which the African is usually delinea- ted, are by no means constant traits.” • Vid.

OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 596 The above ligament is formed by a number of shorter intervertebral ligamentous fibres. The theca 'oertebraUs is also lined by a liga- ment ; it extends from the foramen magnum ossis occipitis, to the os sacrum. There is an elastic yellow ligament passing be- tween the spinous processes of the neck, which corresponding ligament is remarkably strong in the elephant, and in some birds, and tends by its elasticity to save muscular power. There are ligaments which are peculiar to the atlas, and to the last lumbar vertebra. There is an internal transverse ligament of the atlas, which serves to keep the processus dentatus in its place, and to prevent it from passing back- wards, and compressing the spinal marrow. There are capsular ligaments of the oblique pro- cesses of the lowest lumbar vertebrae, and which fix this bone to the sacrum, and also transverse ligainents for uniting the lowest lumbar vertebrae to the posterior and internal surfaces of the os ilium. Ligaments of the Ribs. THE ribs are united before to the sternum or to cartilages, and behind by capsular ligaments to the vertebrae. The cartilages of the ribs are united to each other by perpendicular ligament.

19s OF THE SPINE. duced bvan unequal mechanical pressure, occasion- ed by a paralytic weakness of the muscles and liga- ments, or by a spasmodic over-action of the muscles on any side of the spine, or by people continuing long, or putting themselves frequently into any posture declining from the erect one : In all these cases one common effect follows, to wit, the ver- tebree, or their cartilages, or both, become thick- er on that side where the vessels are free, and be- come thinner on the other side where the vessels are straitened or obstructed. Whenever any morbid curvature is thus made, a second turn, but in an opposite direction to the former, must be formed ; both because the muscles on the convex side of the spine being stretched, must have a stronger natural contraction to draw the parts to which their ends are fixed, and be- cause the patient makes efforts to keep the centre of gravity of the body perpendicular to its base, that the muscles may be relieved from a constant violent contractile state, which always creates uneasiness and pain. The general indication of cure is, to counter- act the bending force, by increasing the com- pression on the convex part of the curvature, and diminishing it on the concave side. The man- ner of executing which in particular cases must be different, and requires a very accurate exami- nation of the circumstances both of the disease and patient. In many such cases, I have found VOL. I. N

OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 228 ternus muscles passing with the anterior crural ves- sels and nerves behind the ligament. Some way below the former ridge, another is extended from the tuberous part of the os pubis downwards and . outwards towards the acetabulum ; between these two ridges the bone is hollow and smooth, for lodging the head of the pectineus muscle. Immediately below, where the lower ridge is to take the turn downwards, a winding niche is made, which is comprehended in the great foramen of a skeleton, but is formed into a hole by a subtended ligament in the recent subject, for the passage of the posterior crural nerve, an artery, and a vein. The internal end of the os pubis is rough and unequal, for the firmer adhesion of the thick ligamentous cartilage that connects it to its fellow of the other side ; The process which goes down from that to the os ischium is broad and rough before, where the gravilis and upper heads of the triceps, or rather quadriceps adductor femoris have their origin. The substance of the os pubis is the same as of other broad bones. State at Birth.—Only a part of the large end of this bone is ossified, and the whole leg is car- tilaginous, in a child born at the full time. Thyroid hole.—Betwixt the os ischium and pu- bis, a very large irregular hole is left, which, from its resemblance to a door or shield, has been cal-

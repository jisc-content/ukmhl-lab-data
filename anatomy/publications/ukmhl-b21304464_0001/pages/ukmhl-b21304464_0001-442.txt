OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 414« of these two flat surfaces is the larger ; behind it a superficial spiral channel, formed by the muscu- lar nerve and the vessels that accompany it, runs from behind, forwards, and downwards. The body of the os humeri is flatted behind by the ex- tensors of the form.-arm. Near the lower end of this bone, a large sharp ridge is extended on its out-side, from which the musculus supinator radii longus, and the longest head of the extensor carpi radialis rise. Opposite to this, there is another small ridge to which the aponeurotic tendon, that gives origin t6 the fibres of the internal and exter- nal brachiaei muscles is fixed ; and from a little depression on the fore-side of it, the pronator radii teres rises. The body of the os humeri becomes gradually broader towards the lower end, where it has several processes ; at the roots of which, there is a cavity before, and another behind *. The anterior is divided by a ridge into two ; the external, which is the least,' receives the end of the radius •, and the internal receives the coronoid process of the ulna in the flexions of the fore-arm, while the posterior deep triangular cavity lodges the olecranon in the extensions of that member. The bone betwixt these two cavities is pressed so thin by the processes of the ulna, as to appear diaphanous in several subjects. The sides of the posterior cavity are stretched

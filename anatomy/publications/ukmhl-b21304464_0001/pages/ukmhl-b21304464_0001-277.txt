The pits at the upper part of the sternum, are at the greatest distance one from another, and, as they descend, are nearer; so that the two lowest are contiguous. The breast-bone is cellular^ with a very thin external plate, especially on its internal surface, where we may frequently observe a cartilaginous crust spread over it *. Whence, with the defence which the muscles give it, and the moveable sup- port it has from the cartilages, it is sufficiently se- cured from being broken ; for it is strong by its quantity of bone ; its parts are kept together by ligaments ; and it yields enough to elude con- siderably the violence offered f. The uppermost piece of the sternum, is some- what of the figure of a .heart, as it is commonly painted ; only it does not terminate in a sharp point. The upper middle-part of this first bone, where it is thickest, is hollowed, to make place for the trachea arteria ; though this cavity J is princi- pally formed by the bone being raised on each side of it, partly by the clavicles thrusting it in- wards, and partly by the sterno-mastoidei muscles pulling it upwards. On the outside of each tubercle, there is an ob- • Jac. Sylv. in Galen, de Ossibus, cap. 12. t Senac, in Memoires de I’Acad. des Sciences, 1724<. f Xipxyn, Jugulum, Furcula superior.

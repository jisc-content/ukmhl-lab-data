^06 OUTLINIS or ANATOMY. called because of its situation in the middle of the bones of the cranium and face, is of such an ir- regular figure, that I know not any thing, to which it may be likened, unless perhaps it bear some faint resemblance to a bat with its wings extended. When we view the external surface of the os sphenoides, two or three remarkable processes from each side of it may be observed, which are all of them again subdivided. The first pair is the two large lateral processes or wings ; the up- per part of each of which is called the temporal process, because they join with the temporal bones in forming the temples, and the seat of a share of the temporal muscles. That part of the wings which juts out towards the inside, some- what lower than the temporal apophyses, and is smooth and hollotved, where it makes up part of the orbit, is thence named orbitar process. Be- hind the edge, separating these two processes, there is often a small groove, made by a branch of the superior maxillary nerve, in its passage to the temporal muscle. The lowest and back-part of each wing, which runs out sharp to meet the ossa petrosa, has been styled the spinous pi'ocess : From near the point of which, a sharp-pointed process is frequently produced downwards, which some call stijiy'orm, ,2Lnd affords origin to the ptery-sta- phylinus externus muscle. From this styloid process a very small groove is extended along the edge of the bone to the hollow- at the root of the

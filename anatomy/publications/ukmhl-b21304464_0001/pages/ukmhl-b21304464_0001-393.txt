OF THE SHAPE OF THE SKULL. 3^5 * Vid. Plate xxi. horn; and the ossific spiculae, instead of describing portions of spheres, as they do at a later period of life, describe only straight lines from their centres of ossification *. Hence the head of a child labouring under hy- drocephalus chronicus, notwithstanding its increas- ed bulk, preserves for some time at least the form it had at birth Some of the prominences on the head are more apparent than others : those on the fore-head espe- cially are apparent even to the most superficial ob- server ; the others also may be discovered by a careful examination. These prominences, in cases of hydrocephalus, correspond in situation, as in the foetus, with the original centres of ossification of the different pieces of the cranium *. The os frontis in the foetus is composed of two pieces. Two projecting parts are seen in the fore- heads of all children labouring under hydrocepha- lus chronicus. There is also a well-marked pro- jection on each side of the head, corresponding with the centres of ossification of the parietal bones. There is only one projection in the upper and middle part of the os occipitis, which corresponds in situation with the largest piece of the os occi- pitis of the foetus. It also frequently happens, that there is a mark- ed inequality in the size of the projections on the op-

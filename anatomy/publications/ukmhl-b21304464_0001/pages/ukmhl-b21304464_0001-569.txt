541 LIGAMENTS OF THE PELVIS. CflAPTER IV. OF THE LIGAMENTS OF THE PELVIS AND INFERIOR EXTREMITIES. Sect. I. OF THE LIGAMENTS OF THE PELVIS. TPhe bones of the pelvis are very firmly bound together by ligaments, as the pelvis supports the weight-of the trunk of the body, and is also the basis on which the inferior extremities move. The form of the bones of the pelvis contributes much to the firmness of it. The os sacrum, from the oblique direction of its articulating surfaces, is like, a wedge placed between the ossa innominata ; the extremities of each of which bones are arched forwards, and united at the symphysis pubis ; hence the greater the depressing power, the more closely the bones of the pelvis are pushed together.

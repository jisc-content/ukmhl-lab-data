OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 64Â» Upon the whole, to me it seems probable, that the arteries of the periosteum, and also those of the substance of the bone, form bone. The power of the vessels of the periosteum is manifest, and also that of the vessels of the bone, and especially during the growth of bones. In young animals, the me- dullary canal is very small; an absorption'takes place internally, while there is a deposition exter- nally from the vessels of the bone, which bears a certain proportion to the absorption i thus the bones increase in bulk. Different theories have been published respect- ing the cause which determines the vessels of the periosteum, or of the bone itself, to begin and carry on the process of ossification. Some have imputed it to the effect of pressure. The induration of bones is also greatly assisted by their being exposed, more than any other parts, to the strong pressure of the great weights they support, to the violent contraction of the muscles fixed to them, and to the force of the parts they contain, which endeavour to make way for their own further growth. By all this pressing force, the solid fibres and vessels of bones are thrust closer; and such particles of the fluids convey- ed in these vessels, as are fit to be united to the fibres, are sooner and more firmly incorporated with them, while the remaining fluids are forcibly driven out by the veins, to be mixed with the mass of blood. In consequence of this, the vesssls gradually diminish as the bones harden. From

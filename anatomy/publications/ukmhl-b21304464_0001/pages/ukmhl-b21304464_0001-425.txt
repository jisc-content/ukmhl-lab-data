397 LIGAMENTS OF THE TRUNK. The heads of the ribs are retained in their places by capsular ligaments^ by which they are joined to the vertebrae and intervertebral cartilages. The ribs are united by their tubercles to the transverse processes of the dorsal vertebrae, by capsular ligaments. There are also internal and external ligaments qf the necks of the ribs. The former originate from the superior margin of the neck of the ribs, and are fixed into the inferior surfaces of the transverse processes of the dorsal vertebrae immediately above ; and the latter, which arise from the up- per margin of the necks of the ribs, are inserted into the external margin of the inferior oblique process of the vertebrae above. Ligaments of the Breast-Bone. There is a thick ligamentous sheath which covers the breast-bone, the fibres of which, may be observed passing in different directions. There are also ligaments which arise from the cartilages of the seventh rib, and are fixed into the ensiform cartilage.' Ligaments qf the Pelvis, called Sacro-Ischiatic. The principal ligaments not only unite the bones of the pelvis, but also support the viscera of the pelvis, and give origin to muscles.

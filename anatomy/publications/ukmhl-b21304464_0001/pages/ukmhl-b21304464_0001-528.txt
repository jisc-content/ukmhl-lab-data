OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 500 OF THE FOOT. The foot is divided, as well as the hand, into three parts, viz. 'Tarsus, Metatarsus, and Toes * : In the description of which, the several surfaces shall be named, according to their natural situation, viz. the broad of the foot, shall be called superior ; the sole, inferior; the side on which the great-toe is, internal; that where the little-toe is, external. â€˜The tarsusf consists of seven spongy bones; to-wit, the astragalus, os Calais, naxiculare, cuboides, cuneforme externum, cuneijorme medium, and cu- rie forme internum. The astragalus is the uppermost of these bones. The os calcis is below the astragalus, and is con- siderably prominent backwards beyond the other bones of the tarsus, to form the hsel. The os na- vicular^ is in the middle of the internal side of the tarsus. The os cuboides is the most external of the row of four bones at the fore-part of the tarsus. The os cuneiforme externum is placed at the inside of the cuboid.- The cunei- forme medium is between the external and inter- nal cuneiform bones, and the internal cuneiform is put at the internal side of the foot. * Dr Camper has recommended that the shoes should be wider before, and more accurately adopted to the form of the foot, in order that the toes may have more full play, and may be less cramped. t Rassctta.

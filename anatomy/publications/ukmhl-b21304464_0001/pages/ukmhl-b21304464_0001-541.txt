dt THE METATARSUS; 513 with the following bone > the superior smooth surface being extended longitudinally, and the in- ferior perpendicularly ; between which, there is a rough fossa. The os metatarsi of the middle toe, is the second in length. Its base, supported by the os cuneiforme externum, is triangular, but slanting outwards, where it ends in a sharp-pointed little process ; and the angle below is not completed. The internal side of this base is adapted to the preceding bone ; and the external side has also two smooth surfaces covered with cartilage but of a different figure j for the upper one is concave, and, being round behind, turns smaller as it ad- vances forwards ; and the lower surface is little, smooth, convex, and very near the edge of the base. The os metatarsi of the fourth toe, is nearly as long as the former, with a triangular slanting base join- ed to the os cuboides, and made round at its ex- ternal angle, having one hollow smooth surface on the outside, where it is pressed upon by the following bone, and two on the internal side, cor- responding to the former bone ; behind which, is a long narrow surface impressed by the os cunei- forme externum. The os metatarsi of the little toe, is the shortest, situated with its two flat sides above and below, and with the ridges laterally. The base of it, part of which rests on the os cuboides, is very large, VOL. I. K k

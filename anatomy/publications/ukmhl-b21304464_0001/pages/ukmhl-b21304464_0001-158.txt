OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 130 that the Jleshy fibres seem to be too thick and rnd^ {6rf performing primarily muscular contraction, and that they rather serve for transmitting the blood, than for accom- j)li*hing animal motion. In fine, that the shortness of the fibrils, and their al- most infinite number, conduce to the strength of muscles; so that plainly, whether we weigh the number of the fi- brils, or their magnitude, or their situation, they seem much fitter for muscular contraction than i\\&fieshy fibres. This is moreover confirmed by ocular inspection; for that, so far as he could ever observe in dissecting living ani- mals, the fieshy fibres, as if dragged by the transverse fi- brils, approached each other, and were not themselves shortened, but seemed to follow the contraction of the fibrils. He prints on the margin of p. 302. the heads of the contents of this page in the following words: “ Fibra- “ rum situs obliquus musculi contractioni minus convenit, “ at fibrillarum positio recta eidem perficiendo idonea “ est.” He delineates in his figure 2d of Table 3., which is exactly copied in Plate 3. fig. 10. of this dissertation, a semipenniform muscle, in which the fleshy fibres ccccc are represented as passing obliquely from the tendon A on one side of the semipenniform muscle, to the tendon B on the other side of it; and his fibrilla membranacea, dd ild, are painted and described as passing transversely from one of the fleshy fibres to another, by which his fibrils are delineated as being parallel with the tendons on the sides of the muscle, or as running in straight and parallel^ lines from the one end of the muscle to the other. “ Et “ sicut fibrae arete conjunctae tendines, ita fibrillarum “ collectio, ex parte saltern aliqua ipsas fibras componere videtur, uti in fig. 2. Tab. 3. apparet.”—See the copy of Mayow’s figure in Plate 3. fig. 10.

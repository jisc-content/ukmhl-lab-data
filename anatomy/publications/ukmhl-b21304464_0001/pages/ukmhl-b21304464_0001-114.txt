OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. Â«6 Bloodvessels of Muscles. The bellies of muscles of the class Mammalia derive their red colour from the number of blood- vessels which are dispersed through their whole substance; for their fibres, when steeped in water, arc found to be white, and very like to the fibrins of the blood. Lymphatic vessels of Muscles. Besides bloodvessels, the muscles have large and numerous lymphatic vessels. It is probable that we have as yet discovered only a few of the lymphatic vessels which are proper to the human muscles; for the valves of these vessels perform their office so accurately, as to- prevent even a very fine liquor from passing from the larger into the smaller raiiiifications. But in the skate*, there are no valves in the small lymphatic vessels; and hence by a successful in- jection the smaller branches of the lymphatic ves- sels may be filled ; and these vessels, when filled by a liquor coloured with vermilion, are so abundant as to give a red tinge to the part. Nerves of Muscles. % The bloodvessels of the muscles are accompa- nied by nerves, which divide into so many and so * Vid. MoNno on Fishes.

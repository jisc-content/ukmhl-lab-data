117 OBLIQUE MUSCLES. machine, by M^hich means the shortening of the oblique, pieces or muscles can be represented ; and as all the parts of the machine are divided into inches, 1,. 2, 3, 4. 5, and parts of an inch, the de- curtation of the pieces representing the oblique museles can be accurately measured, and the mo- tions can be shewn to correspond exactly with the demonstrations before given. 10. Upon the whole, oblique muscles have the fol- lowing effects. 1. Although the force of an oblique muscle is less than that of a straight one of the same number of fibres, in the proportion whieh the perpendicu- lar bears to the length of the oblique fibre, yet oblique muscles, with short and numerous fibres, are employed where great strength is necessary, as in bending the fingers or toes ; or where the part to be moved, the hand or the foot we shall suppose, resists with the advantage of a long lever against the muscles which serve for the flexion and exten- sion of the elbow or knee ; because, as a small de- gree of decurtation of the muscles is sufficient, short fibres will answer the purpose as well as long ones; and hence, as in such oblique muscles there may be many more fibres than in longer straight museles occupying the same space, the oblique are preferred. This resource of nature is so* important, that on recollection you will find that there arc more ob-^

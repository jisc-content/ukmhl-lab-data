But, to return to the superciliary foramina, wc must remark, that often, instead of a hole, a t notch only is to be seen : Nay, in some skulls, scarce a vestige even of this is left; in others, both hole and notch are observable, when the . nerve and artery run separately. Frequently a hole is found on one side, and a notch on the other; at other times we see two holes ; or there is a common hole without, and two distinct entries in- ternally f. Near the middle of the inside of each orbit, hard by, or in the transverse suture, there is a small hole for the passage of the nasal twig of the first branch of the fifth pair of nerves, and of a â€¢ Ruysch, Mus.

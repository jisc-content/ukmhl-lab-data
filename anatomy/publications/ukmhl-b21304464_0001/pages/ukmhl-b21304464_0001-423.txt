LIGAMENTS OF THE TRUNK. 395 Within this joint, there is an inter articular car- tilage, which is thinner in the centre than in the circumference. The skull is fixed to the cervical vertebras, by a general capsular ligament, which surrounds the condyles. There is a perpendicular ligament extending between the occipital bone, and upper part of the tooth-like process of the second cervical ver- tebra. There are also two ligaments, one from each side of the tooth-like process, which have been na- med lateral ligaments, which are inserted into the occipital bone before the condyles. There is also a circular ligament arising from the edge of the foramen spinale, which is inserted into the edge of the foramen magnum. Ligaments of the Vertehrce. The tendons between the spinous and trans- verse processes of the vertebrae, serve the purpose of ligaments, and have been named from their si- tuations. â€˜ A strong ligament, with fibres which follow a longitudinal direction, runs along the fore-parts of the vertebras. This ligament becomes broader the nearer it approaches the os sacrum, and serves to bind together and to defend the vertebrae.

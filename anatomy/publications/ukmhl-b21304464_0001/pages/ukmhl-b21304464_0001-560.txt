532 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. Peroneo-Super-Unguialis, or Extensor Longus PoUicis Pedis. This muscle arises from the hbula and interos- seous ligament; the tendon of this muscle passes over the fore-part of the astragalus and os navi- culare, and is fixed into the base of the first and second phalanges of the great toe. This muscle not only extends the great toe, but also bends the ancle. There are also three Jiexor muscles of the toes. Tibio-Subunguialis, or Flexor Longus Digito- rum Pedis. This muscle arises from the posterior and flatten- ed portion of the tibia; below the soleus muscle^ the fibres pass obliquely into a tendon which is situated on the posterior edge of the muscle. The tendon is lodged within a groove behind the inner ancle, and bound down by a strong ligament. This muscle divides in the sole of the foot into four tendons, (which pass through slits in the ten- dons of the flexor digitorum brevis), and which are inserted into the last joint of the lesser toes. By this muscle, all the joints are bent, but ' chiefly the last joint. Flexor Digitorum Accessorius,or Car- nea HSylvii. This muscle, which is connected by two por- tions to the os calcis, and is fixed into the tendons

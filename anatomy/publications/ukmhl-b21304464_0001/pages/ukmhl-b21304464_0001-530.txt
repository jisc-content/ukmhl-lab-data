OUTLINES OF ANATOMY, 502 The smooth surface, covered with cartilage, be- hind this fossa, is large, oblong, extended in the same oblique situation with the fossa, and concave for its conjunction with the os calcis. The back- part of the edge of this cavity is produced into two sharp-pointed rough processes, between which is a depression made by the tendon of the flexor pollicis longus. The lowâ€™er surface before the fos- sa is convex, and composed of three distinct smooth planes. The long one behind, and the exterior or shortest, are articulated with the heel-bone ; while the internal, which is the most convex of the three, rests and moves upon a cartilaginous liga- ment, that is continued from the calcaneum to the os scaphoides. Without which ligament, the as- tragalus could not be sustained, but would be pres- sed out of its place by the great weight it supports; and the other bones of the tarsus would be sepa- rated. Nor would a bone be fit here, because it must have been thicker than could conveniently be allowed ; otherwise it would break, and would not prove such an easy bending base, to lessen the shock which is given to the body in leaping, run- ning, &.C. The fore-part of this bone is formed into a con- vex oblong smooth head, called by some its pro- cess, which IS received by the os naviculare. Round the root of this head, especially on the up- per surface, a rough fossa may be remarked. The astragalus is articulated in such a manner with the malleoli, that the foot may be bended and

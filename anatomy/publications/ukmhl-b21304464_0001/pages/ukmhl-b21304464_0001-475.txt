OF THE SUPERIOR EXTREMITIES. 44^' Sect. I. OF THE APONEUROSIS OF THE SUPERIOR EXTRE- MITY, AND MUSCLES PROPER TO IT. The muscles of the superior extremity are cover- ed and fixed down by a tendinous aponeurosis, which extends from the different processes of the bones, and'is by some authors said to take its ori- gin from these. The tendinous aponeurosis is thicker on the outer than on the inner side of the arm, and it is thicker on the fore-arm than on the humerus, and at the wrist, the fibres of it are thicker, and are said-to form the annular ligaments. The superficial veins of the arrn are dispose between the skin, and the tendinous aponeurosis, and also the branches of the superficial nerves, and many lymphatic vessels. There is a strong fascia in the fore-arm, as in the leg. The fascia is attached to the condyles of the humerus, and to the olecranon Ulnae, and it is Epicondyle, The external condyle of the Phalange Os Humeri; The 1st ])halanx of the Phalangine Fingers or Toes.

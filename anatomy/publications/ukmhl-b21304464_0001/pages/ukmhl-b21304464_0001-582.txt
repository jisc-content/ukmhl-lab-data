OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. SS'S Sect. XI. LIGAMENTS OF THE PHALANGE^ OF THfe TOES. ■ The capsular and lateral ligaments of the pha- langes of the toes, are similar- to thoSe of the fingers, and the tendons of the extensor and flexor muscles are inclosed within similar sheaths. As my Grandfather, while describing the bones, has made particular mention of the movements performed by the different joints, I have entirely omitted that branch of the subject. The limits of these Outlines preclude me from entering into an explanation of the muscles em- ployed in standing, walking, running, jumping, dancing, swimming, and skating, or on the strength of the human muscles. From the subjoined authors, the reader may obtain much useful information on animal me- chanics. • ’ - •

309 OF THE OS SPHENOIDE3. temporal and pterygoid processes, where the largest share of the external pterygoid muscles have their rise ; Two at the sides of the processus azygos, for forming part of the nose, &c. What I described under the name of temporal and spinous processes on the outside of the skull, are likewise seen on its inside, where they are concave, for receiving part of the brain ; and com- monly three apophyses on the internal surface of the sphenoid bone are only mentioned. Two rising broad from the fore-part of its body, be- come smaller as they are extended obliquely back- wards. The third, standing on a long transverse base, near the back-part of the body of this bone, rises nearly erect, and of an equal breadth, ter- minating often in a little knob on each side. The three are called clinoid, from some resemblance which they were thought to have to the supporters of a bed. Sometimes one or both the anterior clinoid processes are joined to the sides of the po- sterior one, or to the body of the bone itself, brom the roots of the interior clinoid processes the bone is extended on each side outwards and forwards, till it ends in sharp points, named the irumverse spinous process. Between, but a little farther back than the two anterior clinoid pro- cesses, we see a protuberance considerably smal- ler than the posterior clinoid process, but of its shape. Another process from between the trans- ' verse processes, often Ibrces itself forwards into the os ethmoides. U3

MUSCLES OF THE TOES. 531 Sect. VII. MUSCLES OF THE TOES. There are extensor, flexor, abductor and ad- ductor muscles proper to the toes. There are three extensor muscles of the toes, Peroneo-Super-Unguialis, or the Ei'tensor Lon- gus Digit arum Pedis. This muscle takes its rise from the outer part of the head of the tibia, from the fibula and irom- the interosseous ligament; and below the middle of the leg, it splits into four tendons, which in their course pass under the annular ligament, and. arc inserted into the root of the first phalanx of each of the four small toes, and are expanded over the upper side of the toes as far as the last pha- lanx. Calcaneo-Super-Unguialis, or F^xtensor Bre- vis Digitorum Pedis. This muscle arises from the upper and anterior part of the os calcis, from the os cuboides and astragalus ; it then divides into four distinct irius- cles, which are inserted into the first phalanx of the great toe, and into all the other toes excepting the little toe.

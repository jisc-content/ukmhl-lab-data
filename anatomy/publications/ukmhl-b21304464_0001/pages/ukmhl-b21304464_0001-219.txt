OF THE SPINE. 191 f Galen, de usu part. lib. 1. cap. 16. mediate cartilages of the vertebra being pressed all day long by the weight of our body, become more compact and thin in the evening; but when they are relieved from this pressure in the night, they again expand themselves to their former thick- ness ; and seeing the bulk of any part must vary according to the different distension or repletion of the vessels composing it, we may understand how we become taller after a plentiful meal, and decrease after fasting or evacuations *. 6. From the different articulations of the bo- dies, and oblique processes of the vertebrcBy and the different strength of the ligaments, it is plain, that they are formed so as to allow much larger motion forwards than backwards; this last being of much less use, and might be dangerous, by overstretching the large blood-vessels that are contiguous to the bodies of the vertebree f. 7. The intervertebral cartilages shrivelling as they become more solid by age, is the cause why old people generally bow forwards, and cannot raise their bodies to such an erect posture as they had in their youth. At the ordinary time of birth, each vertebra consists of three bony pieceSy connected by carti- lages ; to wit, the bodyy which is not fully ossi- fied, and a long crooked bone on each side ; jon which we see a small share of the bony bridge, • Abbe Fontenu, Histoire de I’Acad. des Sciences, 1725, r

OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 212 thick, and divided into two irregular cavities, by a long perpendicular ridge. The foremost of the two cavities has commonly a thin cartilaginous skin covering it in the recent subject, and is adapt- ed to the unequal protuberance of the os ilium, and a strong ligament connects the circumference of these surfaces of the two bones. The cavity be- hind is divided by a transverse ridge into two, where strong ligamentous strings that go from this bone to the os ilium, with a cellular substance con- taining mucus, are lodged. The tranverse processes of the two last bones of the os sacrum are much smaller than the former. At their back-part near their edge, a knob and ob- long flat surface give rise to two strong ligaments which are extended to the os ischium ; and are therefore called sacrosciatic. The spinal processes of the three uppermost bones of the os sacrum appear short, sharp, and al- most erect, while the two lower ones are open be- hind ; and sometimes a little knob is to be seen on the fourth, though generally it is bifurcated, with- out the two legs meeting into a spine ; in which condition also the first is often to be seen ; and sometimes none of them meet, but leave a sinus, or rather fossa, instead of a canal *. The muscu- lus latissimus and longissimus dorsi, sacro-lumba- lis, and glutaeus maximus, have part of their ori- gins from these spinal processes. • Verheyen, Anat, trac. 5, cap.

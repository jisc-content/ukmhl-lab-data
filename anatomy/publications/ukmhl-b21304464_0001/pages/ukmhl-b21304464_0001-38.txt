OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 10 Other ‘ though the fabric composed of them is so contrived, that, in an erect posture, a perpendicu- lar line, from their common centre of gravity, falls in the middle of their common base *. On this account, we can support ourselves as firmly, as if the axis of all the bones had been a straight line perpendicular to the horizon ; and we have much greater quickness, ease, and strength in se- veral of the most necessary motions we perform. It is true indeed, that wherever the bones, on which any part of our body is sustained, decline from a straight line, the force required in the muscles, to counteract the gravity of that part, is greater than otherwise it needed to have been : But “then this is effectually provided for in such places, by the number and strength of the muscles. So long therefore as we remain in the same posture, a considerable number of muscles must be in a constant state of contraction ; which w'e know, both from reason and experience, must soon create an uneasy sensation. This we call, being- weary of one posture ; an inconvenience that -we should not have had in standing erect, if the bear- ing of all the bones to each other had been per- pendicular ; but this is more than compensated by the advantages above mentioned. 9. The disposition of the bones, and their form have a reference to the function of the part with which they arc connected. Hence the Brain and Spinal Marrow, which are very important organs, * Cowper, Anat. of Human Bodies, cxplic. of t*b. 87, 88.

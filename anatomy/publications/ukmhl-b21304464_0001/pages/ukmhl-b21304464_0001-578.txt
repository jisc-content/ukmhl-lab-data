OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 650 ' Sect. VI. LIGAMENTS OF THE PATELLA, THE patella is fixed in its place, by tlie teridoO of the extensor muscles, and by a strong ligament which is inserted into the anterior tuberosity of the tibia. Sect. VII. OF THE SYNOVIAL APPARATUS OF THE KNEE- JOINT. The synovial apparatus of this joint, from its extent, is very conspicuous The synovial membrane covers the condyles of the thigh-bone, it lines the patella^ and then passes to the tibia. A fatty substance conceals the fimbriae of the synovial apparatus from the naked eye ; and hence my Father has published several representations of it, much magnified. * Vid. M0NR6 on the Bursae Mucosae, Plate viii, fig. 5, 6, 9, and 10.; in which this apparatus is seen, of its natural size, ttnd also much magnified.

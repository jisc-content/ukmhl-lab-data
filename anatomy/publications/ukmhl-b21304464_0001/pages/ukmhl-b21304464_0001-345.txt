OF THE FACE. 317 The superior maxilla *, is the common desig- nation given to the upper immoveable share of the face. The upper jaw is bounded above by the transverse suture, behind by the fore-part of the sphenoid bone, and below by the mouth. The upper jaw consists of six bones on each side, of a thirteenth bone which has no fellow, placed in the middle, and of sixteen teeth. The thirteen bones are, two ossa nasi, two ossa unguis^ two ossa rnalarum, two ossa maxillar’ia, two ossa palatij two ossa spongiosa inferiora, and the •corner. The ossa nasi are placed at the upper part of the nose ; the ossa unguis are at the internal canthi of the orbits; ossa rnalarum form the prominence of the cheeks ; ossa maxillaria form the side of the nose, with the whole lower and fore-part of the upper jaw, and the greatest share of the roof of the mouth; ossa palati are situated at the back-part of the palate, nostrils, and orbit; ossa spongiosa are seen in the lower part of the nares; and the vomer helps to separate these two ca* vities. The.bones of the upper jaw are connected to each other by gomphosis and fifteen sutures. The first is the anterior nasal\^ which is straight, and placed longitudinally in the middle fore-part of the nose. * lixyuf, yitof, Majiclibuls. t Nasalis recta.

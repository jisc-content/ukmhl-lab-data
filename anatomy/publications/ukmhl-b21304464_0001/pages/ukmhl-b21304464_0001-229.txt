OF THE SPINE. 201 the musculi recti majorcs^ and ohliqui inferiorest and to prevent the contusion of these and other muscles in pulling the head back. This second vertebra consists, at the birth, of four bony pieces : For, besides the three which I already mentioned as common to all the vertebrae, the tooth-like process of this bone is begun at this time to be ossified in its middle, and is joined as an appendix to the body of the bone. Lest this appendix be bended or displaced, nurses ought to keep the heads of new-born children from fal- ling too far backwards, by stay-bands, or some such means, till the muscles attain strength sufficient to prevent that dangerous motion. The head is moved forwards and backwards on the first vertebra, while the atlas performs the circumgyratio upon the second vertebra ; the in- ferior oblique processes of the first vertebra on the superior oblique processes of the second, and its body or anterior arch revolving on the tooth-like process, by which the perpendicular ligament that is sent from the point of the tooth-like pro- cess to the occipital bone is twisted, while the lateral ligaments that fix the processus dentatus to the sides of the first vertebra, and to the os occi~ pitis, are very differently affected ; for the one up- on the side towards which the face is turned by the circumgyratio, is much shortened and lax, while the opposite one is stretched and made tense, and yielding at last no more, prevents the head from turning any farther round on this axis.

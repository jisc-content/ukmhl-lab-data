OUTLINES or ANATOMY. 508 The form of the back-part of the os cuboides, and the ligaments connecting the joint there with the os calcis, both concur in allowing little motion in this part The ossification of this bone is scarcely begun at birth. Of the Os Cuneiforme Externum, The Os Cuneiforme Externum f, if we regard its situation or medium by its bulk, is much of the shape of a wedge, being broad and flat above, with long sides running obliquely downwards, and terminating in a sharp edge. The upper surface of this bone is an oblong square. The one behind is nearly a triangle, but not complete at the in- ferior angle, and is joined to the os naviculare. The external side is an oblong square divided as it were by a diagonal; the upper half of it is smooth, for its conjunction with the os cuboides : The other is a scabrous hollow, and in its superior anterior angle, a small smooth impression is made by the os metatarsi of the toe next to the little one. The internal side of this bone is also quad- rangular,' with the fore-part of its edge made flat â€¢ If a weight bears on an arch, that arch is either supported at the sides, or these sides are joined together. It is in the latter way that this joipt is secured. When this ligament is sprained or tom, it generally brings or a tedious or incurable lameness. + Chalcoideum externum.

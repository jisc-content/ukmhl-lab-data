OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. Q58 from the drops of blood they pour out, when the skull is raised from the dura mater in a recent subject. The skull being very thin over these pits, surgeons ought to saw cautiously and slowly through the external table of the skull, when they are performing the operation of the trepan ; since, in a patient whose cranium has these pits, the dura mater and brain may be injured, before the instru- ment has pierced near the ordinary thickness of a table of the skull. The internal base of the skull is extremely un- equal, for lodging the several parts and appendices of the brain and cerebellum, and allowing passage and defence to the vessels and nerves that go into, or come out from these parts. The bones of the cranium are composed of two tables, and intermediate cancelli, commonly called their diploc*. The external table is thickest; the inner, from its thinness and consequent brittleness, has got the name of vitrea. Whence the bad con- sequences, which so often attend a collection of matter in the diploe, either from an external or in- ternal cause, before any sign of such a collection appears in the teguments that cover the part of the skull where it is lodged f. The diploe is similar'in texture and uses in the skull, as the cancelli in other bones. . * Mcditullium, rommissiua. t Bonnet, Sepulchret. Anat. lib. 1. § 1. obs. q6,—103.

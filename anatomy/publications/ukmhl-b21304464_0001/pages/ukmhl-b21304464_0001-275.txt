OF THE RIBS. 247 which become afterwards thin epiphyses. The bodies of the ribs encroach gradually after birth upon the cartilages j so that the latter are propor- tionally shorter, when compared to the ribs, in adults, than in children. ‘Here I cannot help remarking the wise provi- dence of our Creator, in preserving us from pe- rishing as soon as we colne into the world. The ends of the bones of the limbs remain in a carti- laginous state after birth, and are many years be- fore they are entirely united to the main body of their several bones; whereas the condyles oj the oc- cipital bone, and of the loioer jazo, are true original processes, and ossified before birth, and the heads and tubercles of the ribs are nearly in the same con- dition ; and therefore the weight of the large head is firmly supported ; the actions of sucking, res- piration, &.C. which are indispensably necessary for us as soon as we come into -the world, are per- formed without danger of separating the parts of the bones that are most pressed oh in these mo- tions ; whereas, had these processes of the head, jaw, and ribs, been epiphyses at birth, children must have been exposed to danger of dying by such a separation •, the immediate consequences of which would be the compression of the beginning of the spinal marrow, or want of food, or a stop put to respiration.

OF THE STERNUM. 251 cd as a hole; and in this place, for the most part, we may observe a transverse line, which has made authors divide this bone into two. When the cartilage between this and the first bone is not ossified,* a manifest motion of this up- on the first may be observed in respiration, or in raising the sternum, by pulling the ribs upwards or distending the lungs with air in a recent sub- ject. The third bone is much less than the other two, and has only one-half of the pit for the seventh rib formed in it; wherefore it might be reckon- ed only an appendix of the sternum. In young subjects it is always cartilaginous, and is better known by the name of cartilago xiphoides or ensi- formis *, than any other ; though the ancients of- ten called the whole sternum ensiforme, compar- ing the two first bones to the handle and this ap- pendix to the blade of a sword. This third bone is seldom of the same figure, magnitude, or situa- tion in any two subjects ; for sometimes it is a plain triangular bone, with one of the angles be- low, and perpendicular to the middle of the upper side, by which it is connected to the second bone. In other people the point is turned to one side, or obliquely forwards or backwards. Frequently it is all nearly of an equal breadth, and in several subjects it is bifurcated ; whence * Clypealis, gladialis, mucronata, malum, granatum, scutum stomuchi, epiglottalis, cultralis, medium furculee inferioris, sea- tiformis, cnsiculata.

304 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. tal-bone within the orbit, their conjunction is reckoned part of the transverse suture. Farther forward than the ossa plana, the cells are covered by the ossa unguis, which are not only contiguous to these cells, but cannot be separated from them, without breaking the bony substance; and therefore, in justice, those bones ought to be demonstrated as part of the ethmoid bone. Below the ossa unguis and plana, these cells and ossa spongiosa are overlopped by the maxillary bones. The cellular part of each palate-bone is conti-* guous to each os planum, and cells backwards. The lower edge of the nasal perpendicular plate is received into the furrow of the vomer. Its posterior edge is joined to the fore-part of the processus azygos of the sphenoid bone. Its upper edge joins the nasal process of the frontal and nasal bones, and its anterior one is connected to the middle cartilage of the nose. This bone sustains the anterior lobes of the brain ; gives passage to the olfactory nerves, and attachment to the falx; enlarges the organ of smelling, by allowing the membrane of the nose a great extent; straitens the passage of the air through the nose, by leaving only a narrow winding canal, on the sensible membranous sides of wlpch the substances conveyed along with the air must strike; to form part of the or-

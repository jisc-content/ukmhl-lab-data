OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 420 hind; but is sharper at its end, and therefore is named coromid. Between these two processes, a large semicircu- lar or sigmoid concavity is left ; the surface of which, on each side of a middle rising, is slanting, and exactly adapted to the pully of the bone of the arm. Across the middle of it, there is a small sinuo- sity, where, as well as in a small hollow on the internal side of it, the cartilage that lines the rest of its surface is wanting. Round the brims of this concavity the bone is rough, where the capsular ligament of the joint is implanted. > Immediately below the olecranon, on the back- 'part of the ulna, a flat triangular spongy surface appears, on which we commonly lean. At the internal side of this, there is a larger hollow surface, where the musculus anconaeus is lodged ; and the ridge at the inside of this gives rise to the musculus supinator radii brevis. Between the top of the ridge and the coronoid process, is the semilunated smooth cavity, lined with cartilage, in which, and a ligament extend- ed from the one to the other end of this cavity, .the round head of the radius plays. Immediately below it a rough hollow gives lodging to mucila- ginous glands. Below the root of the coronoid process, this bone is scabrous and unequal, where the brachijeus internus is inserted.

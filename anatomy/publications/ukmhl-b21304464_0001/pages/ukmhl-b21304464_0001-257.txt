OF THE FORAMEN THYROIDEUM. S29 % • kd thyj'oides. This hole is all, except the niche for the posterior crural nerve, filled up in a re- cent subject with a strong ligamentous membrane, that adheres very firmly to its circumference. From this membrane chiefly the two obturator muscles, external and internal, take their rise. The great design of this Itole, besides render- ing the bone lighter, is to allow a strong enough. origin to the obturator muscles, and sufficient space for lodging their bellies, that there may be no danger of disturbing the functions of the contain- ed viscera of the pelvis, by the actions of the in- ternal, nor of the external being bruised by the thigh bone, especially by its lesser trochanter, in the motions of the thigh inwards : Both which in- conveniences must have happened, had the ossa innominata been complete here, and of sufficient thickness and strength to serve as the fixed point of these muscles. The'bowels sometimes make their way through the niche for the vessels, at the upper part of this thyroid hole, and this causes a hernia in this place*. In the external surface of the ossa innominata, near the outside of the great hole, a large deep ca- vity is formed by all tbe three bones conjunctly : For the os pubis constitutes about one-fifth ; the P 3 . * Memoires de I’Acad de Chinirgie, torn, 1. p. 709. &c.

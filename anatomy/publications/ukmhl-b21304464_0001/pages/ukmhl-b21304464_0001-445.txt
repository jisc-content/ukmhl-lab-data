It is true that there is not nearly so strong a defence at the lower part of the articulation; but in the ordinary pos- tures of the arm, that is, so long as it is at an acute angle with the trunk of the body, there can- not be any force applied at this place to occasion a'luxation, since the joint is protected so well above. The motions which the arm enjoys by this ar- ticulation, are to every side ; and by the succes- sion of these different motions, a circle may be de- scribed. Besides which, the bone performs a con- siderable rotation round its own axis. But though this can be performed with the round head in all positions ; yet as these vary, the effects upon the body of the bone are very different: For, if the middle of the head is the centre of rotation, as it is when the arm hangs down by the side, the bo- dy of the bone is moved only forwards and back- wards ; because the axis of motion of the head is nearly at right angles wdth the length of the bone * whereas, when the arm is raised to right angles with the trunk of the body, the centre of motion, and the axis of the bone, come to be in the same straight line ; and therefore the body of the os humeri performs the same motion with its head,—Though the motions of the arm seem to be very extensive, yet a large share of them' VOL 1.

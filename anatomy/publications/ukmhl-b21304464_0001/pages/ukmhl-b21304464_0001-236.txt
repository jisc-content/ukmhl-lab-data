OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 208 proper now to remark, that the ligaments which serve that articulation assist in connecting the ver- tebras. Lumbar Vertebrce. The lowest order of the true vertebrae is the lumbar which are five bones that may be distin- guished from many others by these marks: 1. Their bodies, though of a circular form at their fore-part, are somewhat oblong from one side to the other. The epiphyses on their edges are larger, and therefore the upper and lower sur- faces of their bodies are more concave than in the vertebrae of the back. • 2. The cartilages between these vertebrae are much the thickest of any, and render the spine convex towards the abdomen, by their greatest thickness being at their fore-part. S. The oblique processes are strong and deep ; those in opposite sides being placed almost in parallel planes ; the superior, which are concave, facing inwards, and the convex inferior ones facing outwards : and therefore each of these ver- tebrae receives the one above it, and is received by the one below; which is not so evident in the other two classes already described. 4. Their transverse processes are small, long, and almost erect, for allowing large motion to each bone, and sufficient insertion to muscles, and for supporting and defending the internal parts. • Qffifuoi renum, lumboriun.

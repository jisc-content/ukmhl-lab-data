DISEASES OF THE BONES. 165 Luxations may be complicated with fracture, contusion, or with a wound of blood-vessels or nerves ; hence blood may be effused in the cellu- lar substance, or a degree of palsy produced. In consequence of the luxation, the rent in the capsular ligament^ through which the head oj the bo7ie has passed, fills up; and the torn ligament adheres to the iieighbouring parts; the adjacent muscles adapt themselves to the state of the bones, and become stiff; and the head of the displaced bone changes its form. If the head of the displaced bone works upon a flat surface, the cellular substance is condensed into a kind of capsular ligament, then osseous mat- ter is deposited around that ligament, so that a new osseous cavity is formed; and hence a person who had been bedridden for years, regains the power of locomotion. My Father met with a case, where a luxated humerus was' lodged in a new socket, and tied by new ligaments to the scapula. Sometimes a new joint is not formed; yet the dislocated bones accommodate themselves in such a manner to each other, that the patient can walk for a considerable distance after the disease has been of some duration. In the last place, the head of the displaced L3

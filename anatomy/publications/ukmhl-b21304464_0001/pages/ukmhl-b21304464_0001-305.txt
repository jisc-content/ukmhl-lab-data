277 OF THE OS FRONTIS. and worms or other insects, must give great un- easiness *. The upper circular part of the os frontis is join- ed to the ossa parietalia, from one temple to the other, by the coronal suture. From the termina- tion of the coronal suture to the external angular processes, this bone is connected to the sphenoid by the sphenoidal suture. At the .external canthi of the eyes, its angular processes are joined by the transverse suture to the ossa malarum, to which it adheres one-third down the outside of the or- bits ; whence to the bottom of these cavities, and a little up on their internal sides, these orbitar processes are connected to the sphenoidal bone by that same suture. In some few skulls, however, a discontinuation of these two bones appears at the upper part of the long slit, near the bottom of the orbit. On the inside of each orbit, the orbi- tar process is indented between the cribriform part of the ethmoid bone, and the os planum and un- guis. The transverse suture afterwards joins the frontal bone to the superior nasal processes of the ossa maxillaria superiora, and to the nasal bones. And, lastly, its nasal process is connected to the nasal lamella of the ethmoid bone. The frontal bone serves to defend and support the anterior lobes of the brain.

OF THE SCAPULA. 407 by part of the subscapularis; and between the two a ridge with a small depression appears, where the longus extensor cubiti has its origin. The superior costa is very thin; and near its fore-part there is a semilunar nitch, from one end of which to the other, a ligament is stretched ; and sometimes the bone is continued, to form one, or sometimes two holes for the passage of the sca- pular blood-vessels and nerves. Immediately be- hindthis semilunar cavity, the coraco-hyoid muscle has its rise. From the nitch to the termination of the fossa for the teres-minor, the scapula is nar- rower than any wâ€™here else, and supports the third process. This part has the name of cervix. The whole dorsum of the scapula is divided into two cavities by the spine, which is stretched from behind forwards, much nearer to the supe- rior than to the inferior costa. The cavity above the spine is really concave, where the supra-spinatus muscle is lodged ; while the surface of this bone below the spine, on which the infra-spinatus muscle is placed, is convex, ex- cept a fossa that runs at the side of the inferior costa. The internal or anterior surface of this bone is hollow, except in the part above the spine, which is convex. The subscapularis muscle is extended over this surface, where it forms several ridges and intermediate depressions, commonly mistaken for prints of the ribs; they point out the inter- C c 4

or THE OSSA PALATI. 33S Ossa Palati. The Ossa Palati are commonly described as tw& small square bones, at the back-part of the palate or roof of the mouth, though they are of much greater extent, being continued up the back-part of the nostrils to the orbit*. Each palate-bone may therefore be divided into four parts, the pa- late-square-bone, the pterygoid process, nasal la- mella, and orbitar process. The square bone is unequally concave, for en- larging both the mouth and cavity of the nose. The upper part of. its internal edge rises into a spine, after the same manner as the palate plate of the maxillary bone does, to be joined with the vomer. Its anterior edge is unequally ragged, for its firmer connexion with the palate process of the os maxillare. The internal edge is thicker than the rest, and of an unequal surface, for its conjunc- tion with its fellow of the other side. Behind, this bone is somewhat in form of a crescent, and thick, for the firm connexion of the velum pen- dulum palati; the internal point being produced backwards, to afford origin to the palato-staphyli- nus or azygos muscle. The square bone is well • Eustach. Tab. 47. Fig. 1. 3. 6. 7. 8. Vidus Vidius, de Anat. lib. 2. cap. 2. Explicat. Tab. 6. Fig. I9. Winslott, Me- moires de I’Acad. des Sciences, I720.

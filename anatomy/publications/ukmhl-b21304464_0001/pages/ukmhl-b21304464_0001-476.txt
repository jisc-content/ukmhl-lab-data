448 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. Stronger on the back than on the fore-part of the arm, in consequence of the addition of tendinous fibres from the triceps extensor muscle ; and the tendinous aponeurosis of the fore-part of the arm is rendered stronger by the addition of tendons from the scapulo-radialis muscle. This fascia sends processes between the muscles of the fore-arm, which have been named by some authors intermuscular ligaments, from which many tendinous muscular fibres take their origin. At the wrist there are two annular ligaments, the ligamentum carpi annulare postei'ius, under which the tendons of the extensor muscles pass, which extends transversly between the styloid process of the ulna, and os pisiforme, and is fixed to the sty- loid process of the ulna, and the ligamentum carpi anterius, which passes across the fore-part of the wrist, extends between the os pisiforme and os unciforme, and the os scaphoides, and un- der this, the tendons of the flexor muscles pass to the hand. In the palm of the hand, there is a strong fascia, which is connected with the tendon of the palma- ris longus, and which covers the greater share of the palm of the hand, and is fixed to the roots of the fingers by an equal number of double slips of tendon. There are two muscles proper to the tendinous aponeurosis of the superior extremity, the Epi- trochlo-Palmaris, or Palmaris Loiigus, and the Palmaro-Cutaneus, or Palmaris Brevis.

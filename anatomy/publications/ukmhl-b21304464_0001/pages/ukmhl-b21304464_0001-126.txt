9S OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. of relaxation for a number of hours; and a sphinc- ter muscle, such as the sphincter ani, may conti- nue for the same number of hours in a state of contraction ; and hence the voluntary muscles or the sphincter muscles cannot he said to be in an al- ternate state of contraction and relaxation, as we possess the power of throwing our muscles into that state which is most conducive to our safety and convenience. The heart and the intercostal muscles are per- haps more completely relaxed than the voluntary muscles, in order that the blood and the air may enter the heart and lungs more freely. The relaxation of the voluntary muscles is less complete, or in a sort of middle state, such as makes them ready for a greater degree of either state, without requiring such an exertion as ex- hausts the nervous energy. A moderate degree of contraction is constantly taking place in all our muscles, as is evident in those of the face in tlie case of hemiplegia, the diseased side being evidently much more relaxed than the sound. Observatlms on the Collocation of Muscles. Galen, in his treatise De Usu Partium, has de- scribed the several qualifications of each particular muscle, its position, figure, just magnitude, its fulcrum, its point of action, and its collocation with respect to its two ends.

or THE OSSA MAXILLAR.IA SUPERIORA. 829 before it has escaped from the bone. The second is the foramen incisivum, just behind the fore-teeth, which, at its under part, is one irregular hole com- mon to both the maxillary bones when they are joined ; but, as it ascends, soon divides into two, three, or sometimes more holes; some of which open into each nostril. Through them small ar- teries and veins, and a twig of the second branch of the fifth pair of nerves pass, and make a com- munication between or join the lining coats of the nose and mouth. In some subjects, Stenoâ€™s duct may be traced some way on the side of these passages next to the nose, and small orifices may be observed opening into the mouth. The first common hole is that which appears at the inner side of the back-part of the tuberosity and of the sockets of the teeth, and is formed by a fossa in this bone, and a corresponding one in the os palati; Through it a nerve, which is a branch of the second branch of the fifth pair, runs to the palate. The other common hole is the great slit in the outside of the orbit described already, as the second common hole of the sphenoid bone. On the nasal process often holes may be ob- served for the passage of vessels to the substance of the bones ; and, at the back-part of each tu- berosity, several foramina are placed, for the trans- mission of nerves to the cavity within: But these are uncertain. The body of the maxillary bone is hollow and leaves a large sinus, akin to the frontal and sphe-

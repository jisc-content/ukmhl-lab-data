LIGAMENTS OF THE KNEE-JOINT. 54() interna, by which the synovial apparatus is fixed to the sides of the patella ; and this apparatus is also fixed by a ligamentum mucosum, which is continued from the union of the ligamenta alaria, to the cavity of the thigh-bone between its con- dyles, immedia*tely in front of the anterior crucial ligaments. There are two ligaments which cross each other, hence named crucial, the one of which is fixed to the semilunar shaped notch, between the condyles of the thigh-bones, and to the pit at the fore part of the protuberance in the middle of the head of the tibia ; and the other, which is fixed in a si- milar manner to the thigh-bone, passes behind the former, and is fixed into a pit behind the above named protuberance. The head of the tibia is divided by a protube- rance of bone, into two parts, each of which is somewhat excavated, and each cavity is rendered deeper by a cartilage, somewhat of the form of a crescent, which surrounds that cavity ; which car- tilage, in its inner part, is as thin as the blade of a knife ; but in its outer part, three or four lines in the thickness; and the thicker part of the carti- lage is connected to the capsular ligaments, hence these cartilages scarcely change their places. The upper surface of each cartilage is concave, the lower nearly flat. These cartilages are connected to each other at their inner cornua, by a small transverse ligament, M m S

OF THZ OS SPHENOIDES. 313 the extreme point of the os petrosum and the spU nous process of the cuneiform bone. This hole only appears after the bones are boiled ; for, in a recent subject its back-part is covered by a thin bony plate that lies over the internal carotid ar- tery, and farther forward it is filled with a car- tilaginous ligament, under which the cartilaginous part of the eustachian tube is placed ; It was by this passage that the ancients believed the slimy matter was conveyed from the emunctory of the brain, the glandula pituitaria, to the fauces. The second common hole is the large discontinuation of the external side of the orbit, left between the orbitar processes of the cuneiform bone, the os maxillare, malae, and palati. In this large hole the fat for lubricating the globe of the eye and temporal muscle is lodged, and branches of the superior maxillary nerve, with small arteries from the carotid and veins pass. The third hole is formed between the base of this bone and the root of the orbitar process of the palate-bone of each side. Through this a branch of the external caro- tid artery, and of the second branch of the fifth pair of nerves, are allowed a passage to the nostrils, and a returning vein accompanies them. Some^ times, however, this hole is proper to the palate bone, being entirely formed out of its substance. Under the sella turcica, and some way farther forward, but within the substance of the sphenoid ' bone, are two sinuses separated by a bony plater, Each of them is lined with a membrane, and opens

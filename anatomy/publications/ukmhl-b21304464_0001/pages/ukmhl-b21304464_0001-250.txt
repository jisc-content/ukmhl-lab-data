OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 2S2 equalities are occasioned by the actions of the muscles that are situated on this surface. From behind the uppermost of the two anterior spinal processes, in such bones*as are strongly marked by the muscles, a semicircular ridge is ex- tended to the hollow passage of the sciatic nerve. Between the spine and this ridge, the glutaeus medius takes its rise. Immediately from above the lowest of the anterior spinal processes, a se- cond ridge is stretched to the niche. Between this and the former ridge, the glutaeus minimus has its origin. On the outside of the posterior spi- nal processes, the dorsum of the os ilium is flat and rough, where part of the musculus glutaeus maxi- mus and pyriformis rises. The lowest part of this bone is the thickest, and is formed into a large cavity with high brims, to assist in composing the great acetabulum ; which shall be considered, af- ter all the three bones that constitute the os in- nominatum are described. The internal surface of the os ilium is concave in its broadest fore-part, where the internal iliac muscle has its origin, and some share of the intes- tinum ilium and colon is lodged. From this large hollow, a small sinuosity is continued obliquely forwards, at the inside of the anterior inferior spinal process, where part of .the psoas and iliacus muscles, with the crural ves- sels and nerves pass. The large concavity is bounded below by a sharp ridge, which runs from behind forwards j and, being continued with such ano-

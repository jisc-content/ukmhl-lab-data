100 OUTLINES or ANAi-OMT. number of muscles must be thrown into action to' maintain the equilibrium, or there are muscles which modify or limit the action of the flexor and extensor muscles. 3d, The muscles are so disposed as not to inter- fere with one another. 4th, The action of many muscles accords with their position andform. From the position and form of the muscles an estimate may be formed of their action, the con- traction of muscles being towards their centre, the figure of the muscle is adjusted, and its form mo- dified so as to produce the necessary motion; thus the long muscles stretched between certain points, must draw these, towards each other when they contract; a hollow muscle, like the bladder of urine, discharges its contents ; and a sphincter muscle, from the circular disposition of its fibres, and its position, is well adapted for a contracted state, sufficient fof retention, but which may be overcome when it is necessary. 5th, Many of our mon)cments are accomplished by the combined action of several muscles. The movements of many parts of our bodies are the result of the combined action of several muscles ; and frequently, diagonal motion is pro- duced, the tendons of the muscles pulling in the di- rection of the sides of a parallelogram; for example, the head is drawn downwards in the diagonal by the combined action of the sterno-cleido-mastoidei tnuscles, and sidewise towards the shoulder by the

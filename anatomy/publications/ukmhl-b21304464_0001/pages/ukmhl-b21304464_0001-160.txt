132 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. Antagonist Muscles. In a former page, it was observed that there wore antagonist muscles, Flexor and Extensor muscles, which act by an opposite pull. Such a disposition of the muscles is conducive not only to the reciprocal energetic motion of the limbs, but also to their symmetry. Thus, after the flexor muscles of the fore-arm have bent it, the extensor muscles act, and extend and straighten it. The flexor muscles are generally stronger than the extensors, owing to their fibres being more numerous, and to their being inserted further from the centre of motion ; hence, during sleep, the limbs are generally somewhat bent. Velocity of Muscular Action. The velocity and precision of. muscular action are very remarkable, and of these there are many striking examples, as in speaking, writing, run- i ning, &c. Effect of Custom on Muscular Action. Custom exercises its sway over the muscles. The bladder of urine affords an example of the effects of custom: some persons retain a large quan- tity of urine in it, but others have a call to make water when it contains only a few ounces of urine.

LIGAMENTS OF THE PELVIS. 3Q9 There is a capsular ligament proper to the os coccygis, which serves to unite it to the os sacrum. Faupari's ligament^ or the ci'UJ'al arch, has been described by some authors as a ligament of the pelvis. I have described it as the tendon of the ex- ternal oblique muscle of the abdomen. The ligaments called ilio-sacral, take their rise from the posterior spinous process of the os ilium, and are fixed to the third and fourth spinous trans- verse processes of the os sacrum. There are strong capsular ligaments which con- nect the os sacrum to the ossa innominata ; and within these joints, there are three layers of car- tilage, which adhere to the os sacrum upon the joint being opened ; and within this joint, there is a yellow-coloured ligamentous substance which contains mucus. The large apertures on the back-part of the os sacrum, are surrounded by vaj'ious ligaments, which extend from one tubercle to another, and which tend to protect' the vessels passing beneath them. The ossa pubis are united hy a capsular liga- ment, called the capsular ligament of the symphysis pubis. Upon opening this joint, w^e find, besides the cartilage covering each of the ossa pubis, a?i inter- mediate cartilage, somewhat like the intervertebral cartilages, consisting of fibres disposed in a trans- verse direction.

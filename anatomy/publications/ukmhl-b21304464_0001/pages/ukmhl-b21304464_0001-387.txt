OF THE FORM OF THE SKULL. Si 9 the brain lodged principally upon the orbit of the lower side, in consequence of which, the eye was lower down in the face than the other, and the fore-head assumed a very peculiar appearance. That the bones derive their form rrcm the softer parts, is also obvious, from iht remarkable, alteration in the form of the jau>s xvhen the teeth have fallen out. The roof of the mouth, which vvas arched, be- comes flat; the cavity of the mouth is therefore diminished, and sufficient space is not left for the tongue, and hence it is protruded out of the mouth when it is moved forwards even slightly, and it appears longer. The distance of the chin from the nose becomes shorter by one-sixth part of the length (f the head, and the nose and chin seem to touch each other. The pulps of the teeth also determine the figure of the teeth, in the same manner as the brain de- termines the form of the skull. The pulps have acquired the same form as the complete teeth, before the ossification of the teeth has begun. When the ossification of the body of the tooth has been in part completed, the pulp is ejongated, and upon the elongated pulps, the roots of the teeth are formed. The above circumstances, seem to me to prove, that the internal distention is the primary cause of the form of the skull and teeth. Z 4

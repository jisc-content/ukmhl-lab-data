OF THE OS FRONTIS. 269 The external surface of the os frontis is smooth at its upper convex part; but several processes and cavities are observable below; For, at each angle of each orbit, the bone juts out, to form four processes, two internal, and as many external; which, from this situation, may well enough be named angular. Between the internal and ex- ternal angular processes of each side, an arched ridge is extended, on which the eye-brows are placed. Verv little above the internal end of each of these superciliary ridges, a protuberance may be remarked, in most skulls, where there are large cavities, called shiuses, within the bone. Betwixt the internal angular processes, a small process rises, which forms some share of the nose, and thence is named nasal. Some observe a protuberant part on the edge of the bone behind each external angular process, which they call temporal processes *, but these are inconsiderable. From the under part of the superciliary ridges, the frontal bone runs a great way backwards ; which parts may justly enough be called orbitar processes. These are concave externally, for re- ceiving the globes of the eyes, with their muscles, fat *, &c. * For a particular account of the orbits, see Camper, Diss. Phys. de quibusdam oculi partibus; and the 7th chap, of Zinn, Descrip, anat. oculi humani.

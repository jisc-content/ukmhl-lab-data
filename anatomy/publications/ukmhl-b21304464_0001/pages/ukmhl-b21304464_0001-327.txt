Of the eight bones which belong to the cranium, there are only two which are not yet described, viz. the ethmoid and sphenoid. These we already mentioned, in complaisance to the generality of writers on this subject, as bones common to the cranium and face, because they enter into the composition of both : But the same reason might equally be used for calling the frontal-bone a common one too. Os Ethmoides. The Os Ethmoides *, or the sieve-like bone, has got its name from the great number of small holes with which that part of it first taken notice of, is pierced. When this bone is entire, the'figure of it is not easily described ; but, by a detail of its several parts, some idea may be afforded of the whole ; and therefore I shall distinguish it into the cribriform lamella, with its process, the nasal lamella, cellulce, and ossa spongiosa. The thin horizontal lamella, is all (except its back-part) pierced obliquely by a great number * Cribriforme, c-ToyyesiJJir, spongiforme, cristatum.

OUTLINES or ANATOMY- 338 substance, but have their anterior and upper edges, contiguous' to the transverse ridges of the nasal processes of the maxillary and palate bones. From their upper straight edge, two small processes stand out; The posterior, which is the broadest, descends to cover some of the antrum highmoria- num ; the anterior rises up to join the os unguis, and to make part of the lacrymal duct. Below the spongy bones already mentioned,- there are sometimes two others, one in each nos- tril, which seem to be a production of the sides df the maxillary sinus turned downwards *. When this third sort of spongy bones is found, the mid- dle one of the three in each nostril is the largest, and the lowest is the smallest. Besides all these, there are often several other small bones standing out into the nostrils, that, from their shape, might also deserve the name of turbinata, but are uncertain in their bulk, situation, and num- ber f. There are a number of foveoli, but no holes in the os turbinatum inferius. They are joined to the ossa maxillaria, palati and unguis in old subjects, by a firm union of substance ; and as this happens also frequently in people of no great age, some J are of opinion, * CowPER in Drake's Anthropolog. book 3. chap. 10. t Santorin.

Synneurosis, or syndesmosis, when ligaments are the connecting bodies, as they are in all the moveable articulations. 3. Syssarcosis, when muscles are stretched from one bone to another, without the intervention of cartilage or ligament. The second class of articulations, the synar- throsis, which is the general term by which the immoveable conjunction of bones is expressed, is divided into three kinds : 1. The suture *, is that articulation where two bones are mutually indented into each other, or as if they were sewed together, and is formed by the fibres of two bones meeting, while they are yet flexible and yielding, and have not come to their full extent of growth ; so that they mutual- ly force into the interstices of each other, till, meeting with such resistance as they are not able to overcome, they are stopped from sprouting out farther, or are reflected; and therefore these in- dentations are very different, both in figure and magnitude : Thus the bones of the head are join- ed ; thus epiphyses are joined to the bones, before their full connection and union with them.

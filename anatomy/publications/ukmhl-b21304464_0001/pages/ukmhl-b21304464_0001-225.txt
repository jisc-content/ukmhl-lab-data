In a first verte- bra from which the second has been separated, this hollow makes the passage tor the sipnal mar- row seem much larger than it really is : On each side of it a small rough sinuosity may be remark- ed, where the ligaments going to the sides of the tooth-like process of the following vertebra arc fastened ; and on each side, a small rough pro- tuberance and depression is observable, w'here the transverse ligament, which secures the tooth-like process in the sinuosity, is fixed, and hinders that process from injuring the medulla spinalis in the flexions of the head. Instead of the spinal process, there is a large bony arch, that the muscles which pass over this vertebra at that place might not be hurt in ex- tending the head. On the back and upper part of this arch there are two depressions, where the recti postki mino- res take their rise ; and at the lower part are two other sinuosities, into which the ligaments which cormect this bone to the following one are fixed. The superior oblique processes of the atlas are large, oblong, hollow, and more horizontal than in any other vertebra. They rise more in their external than internal brim ; by which their ar- ticulations with the co7idybid processes of the os occipitis are firmer. Under the external edge of each of these ob- lique proceses, is the Jossa, or deep open channel, N 3

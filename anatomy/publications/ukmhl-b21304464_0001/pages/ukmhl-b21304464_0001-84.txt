56 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. Is Bone deposited in a solid or fluid state ? Solid bone has been supposed by Dr Nisbet to exist in the blood. “ What has now been ob- “ served concerning the different manners of bony production, and the phenomena which are vi- “ sible during the progress of ossifications within “ cartilaginous parts, are fully sufficient to prove “ all bony particles to be originally contained in the blood, or a fluid secreted from it According to Bonhomme, the process of ossifi- cation may be accelerated, by mixing a proportion of phosphate of lime with the food of’ animals *, and diseases originating from a deficiency of earthy matter in the bones, may be cured by similar means. But the above observations are entirely hypo- thetical, and throw no light on the subject they profess to explain. As a proof that secretion is a much more complex process than the merely straining through vessels certain solids or fluids which exist in the blood, I shall cite an experi- ment of Vauquelin, who confined a hen for a fortnight, carefully examined the food of the ani-, mal and the eggs she laid, and found, that in that space of time there was an excess of 500 grains of the carbonate of lime, but that a portion of the sjljca had disappeared. * Vicl, Human Osteogeny, p. ^7,

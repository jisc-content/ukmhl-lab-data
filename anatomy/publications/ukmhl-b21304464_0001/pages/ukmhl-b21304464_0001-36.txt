8 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 3. The skeleton determines the size, figure, . position, proportion, and motions of the several members of the body, and regulates its attitudes. 4. The skeleton forms an essential part of the organs of locomotion, being an immoveable ful- crum for the action of the muscles and their tendons, without which they could not act j hence when the bones are rendered soft by disease, we lose the power of locomotion. The bones of the spine and extremities of the body, form solid, though flexible columns, ca- pable of being moved in various directions. 5. The extremities of the bones give form to the joints ; and this connection has been termed their articulation. The increased volume of the extremities of the bones, tends to render the jointsmore secure,— is conducive to the symmetry of the limbs, the bellies of the muscles being attached to the middle parts of the bones, and the tendons to their pro- tuberances,—increases the force of the muscles which bend and extend the members,—prevents the risk of attrition, laceration,^ or compression of those muscles or their tendons, which are necessary for the motion of the joint,—and protects from in- jury or pressure, during our sudden movements, or changes of curvature, the bloodvessels and nerves in the vicinity of the moveable joints. By studying the form of the bones of the joints, we may discover what particular motion is per- formed by that joint \ there being an exact

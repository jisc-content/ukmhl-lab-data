OSTEOLOGY. 69 hours, had acquired from a small portion of car- tilage that it had dissolved, a reddish-brown co- lour ; and the latter, though most of the cartilage had disappeared, yet remained colourless. The nitric acid acted readily on it, and formed a yel- low solution. “ Both the concentrated sulphuric and muriatic acid quickly dissolved it, when assisted by a gentle heat. The sulphuric solution was of a dark red- dish-brown, and the muriatic was of a light red- dish purple. ‘‘ A strong solution of potash also easily dissol- ved it. “ 100 grains of it were slowly, but completely dried. In this state it had the appearance of horn, being brittle, and semitransparent. The loss it sustained was equal to 55 grains. “ The dried cartilage was heated to redness in a platina crucible: it swelled'up very much, seem- ed to fuse, inflamed, and left a bulky charcoal. This charcoal incinerated, aiforded about ^ grain of earthy matter, whicdi, as it dissolved in nitric acid, and was again precipitated by ammonia, ap- peared to be phosphate of lime. “ Hence, it may be concluded that 100 parts of human cartilage consist of about 44.5 Albumen. 55.0 Water. .5 Phosphate of Lime.

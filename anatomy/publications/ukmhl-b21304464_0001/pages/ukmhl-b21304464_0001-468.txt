440 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. - The external side of the body of this bone is more hollowed by the action of muscles, than the internal. The tubercle at the internal root of its head is larger than the external. Its base is so firmly fixed to the bone it is conÂ« nected with, that it has no motion. The Os metacarpi medii digiti is generally the se- cond in length.; but often it is as long as the form- er; sometimes it is longer ; and frequently it ap- pears to equal the first only by the os magnum being farther advanced downwards than any other bone of the wrist. Its base is a broad superficial cavity, slanting outwards ; the internal posterior angle of which is so prominent, as to have the appearance of a pro- cess. The internal side of this base is made plain in the same way as the external side of the former bone, while its external side has two hollow cir- cular surfaces, for joining the third metacarpal bone, and between these surfaces there is a rough fossa, for the adhesion of a ligament, and lodging mucilaginous glands. The shorter head of the bl- cornis is inserted into the back-part of this base. The two sides of this bone are almost equally flatted ; only the ridge on the fore-part of the bo- dy inclines outwards. The tubercles at the fore- part of the root of the head are equal. The mo- tion of this bone is very little more than the first metacarpal one has j arid therefore these two firm-

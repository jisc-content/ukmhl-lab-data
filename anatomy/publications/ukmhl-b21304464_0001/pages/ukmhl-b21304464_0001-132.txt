Â©UTLINES OF ANATOMY. 104 5thly^ From the muscles being parrallel to the bones they move, there must be a great loss of power. ^thlyy The fleshy fibres of a muscle are so disposed with respect to the tendon, as not to act in a line with it: hence a very great loss of power *, and in like manner the general obliquity of the mus- cular fibres also produces, as in the penniform muscles, a great loss of power. It merits mention also, that the loss of power arising from the position of the muscles, and man- ner in which their tendons are fixed into the bones, is in a degree counterbalanced by the mul- tiplication of the fibres of the muscles, by the in- creased diameter of the extremities of the bones, and by the introduction of moveable bones, as the patella and sesamoid bones, which alter the direc- tion of the muscles, and increase their power. OJ Oblique Muscles. There are many important advantages gained by the oblique course of the fibres of the muscles^ which are fully explained in the subjoined pages on that subject, with which I have been favoured by my Father,

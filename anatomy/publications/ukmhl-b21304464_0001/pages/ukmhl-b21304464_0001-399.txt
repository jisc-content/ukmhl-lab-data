OF THE OSSIFICATION IN THE SUTURES. 371 of bone in the membranes'uniting, the bones of the cranium have, in the progress of ossification, adhered firmly to them. The ossification takes place at different times in the different sutures. The membrane uniting the pieces of the os frontis, is generally ossified when the child is be- tween its twelfth and twentieth month. The membrane betwixt the os occipitis and parietal bones, is not ossified until a much later period of life ; and the sagittal and coronal su- tures were not ossified in the boy of nine years of age. These membranes are of unequal breadth ; that between the two pieces of the os frontis, and that between the parietal bones being broader than the others, allow these bones to recede from eachâ€™ other to a considerable distance, and hence, as has been already observed, the head acquires an ex- traordinary breadth. From a similar cause, the os occipitis is also protruded ; and were it not owing to the patient generally resting on the back- part of his head, that part of the head would also become very prominent. In short the head' acquires its unusual bulk, in part from the greater size of the pieces of the cranium-case, and also from the ossification of the membranes which unite these different pieces together. Having described the changes which take place in the size and form of the head, during the suc- Aa2

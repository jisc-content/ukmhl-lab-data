SUTURES OF THE SKULL. 267 bones of the cranium .sometimes overlap each other *. 2. That this capsula is more easily formed and extended into a spherical figure, than if it had been one continued bone. 3. As there is a freer communication of the ves- sels without, and of those within the skull, larger here than in any other part of the cranium, ac- cording to some moderns ; and therefore cucuphse, fomentations, cataplasms, cephalic plasters, blisters, are applied, and issues are eroded, or cut in the head, at those places where the sutures are longest in forming, and where the connexion of the bones is afterwards loosest, for the cure of a phrenitis, mania, inveterate headach, epilepsy, apoplexy, and other diseases of the head. 4. That the dura mater may be more firmly suspended by its processes, which insinuate them- selves into this conjunction of the bones; for do- ing this equally, and where the greatest necessity of adhesion is, the sutures are disposed at nearly equal distances, and the large reservoirs of blood, the sinuses, are under or near them. 5. That fractures might be prevented from reaching so far as they would in a continued bony substance. 6. Thatthe connexionatthesutures being capable * According to Mr Gibson of Manchester, the bones of the skull extend chiefly at the edges, and the sutures admit of the intervention of a vascular menbrane and when ossification has been completed, the sutures are obliterated.

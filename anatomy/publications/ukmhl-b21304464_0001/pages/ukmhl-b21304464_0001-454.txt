426 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. fibres of the muscles situated here, that are so much sunk between the bones, as to be protected from injuries, to which they would otherwise be exposed. But this ligament is wanting near the upper end of the fore-arm, where the supinator radii brevis, and flexor digitorum profundus, are immediately connected*. Both ends of the bones of the fore-arm are first cartilages, and then epiphyses in children. As the head of the radius receives the tubercle of the os humeri, it is not only bended and extend-r ed along with the ulna, but may be moved round its axis in any position ; and that this motion round its axis may be sufficiently large, the li- gament of the articulation is extended farther down than ordinary on the neck of this bone, be- fore it is connected to it; and it is very thin at its upper and lower part, but makes a firm ring in the middle. This bone is also joined to the ulna by a double articulation ; for above, a tubercle of the radius plays in a socket of the ulna ; whilst below, the radius gives the socket, and the ulna the tubercle ; But then the motion performed in these two is | very different; for at the upper end, the radius J does no more than turn round its axis; while at the lower end, it moves in a sort of cycloid upon the round part of the ulna ; and as the hand is ar- ticulated and firmly connected here with the ra^ dius, they must move together. * Weitbuecht, Syndesmolog.

OF THE FIBULA. 49s are sent into these three last bones, ffiust suffer a considerable reflection before they come at the cancelli. The reason of this diversity may per- haps be, that the arteries which are so small with- in the bones as to have no strong contractile pro- pelling force in their coats, and where they arc not assisted by the action of any moving neigh- bouring organ, should have, at least in their pas- sage through the bone, a favourable descent for their liquids. The lower end of the fibula is extended into a spongy oblong head, on the inside of which is a convex, irregular, and frequently a scabrous sur- face, that is received by the external hollow^ of the tibia, and so firmly joined to it by a very thin intermediate cartilage and strong ligaments, that it scarce can move. Below this, the fibula is stretched out into a coronoid process, that is smooth, covered with cartilage on its internal side, and is there conti- guous to the outside of the first bone of the foot *, the astragalus, to secure the articulation. This process, named malleolus externus, being situated farther back than the internal malleolus, and in an oblique direction, obliges us naturally to turn * Hence luxiitions of the foot are very rare, and produced only by very great violence, and such luxations arc frequently accompanied by a fracture of one of the malleoli. The luxa- tion inwards, is more frequent than the luxation outwards, the malleolus internus being shorter than the malleolus externus.

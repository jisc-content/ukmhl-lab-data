The cavities on the surfaces of the bones, (with the exception of the articular cavities,) are in- tended for the reception of the muscles, or for giving passage to their tendons ; thus, the ex- tent ot the surface of the bone is increased, though not its bulk. The cavities allow the heads of bones to play in them; lodge and defend other parts; and afford safe passage to vessels, muscles, &-c. ' The Articulations. The ARTICULATIONS are most commonly di- vided into three classes, viz. symphysis^ synar- i/n'osis, and diarthrosis.

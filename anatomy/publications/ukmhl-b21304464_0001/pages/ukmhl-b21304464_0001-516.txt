OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 488 On the internal side of this, there is a broad scabrous slightly-hollowed surface, to which the internal long ligament- of the joint, the apo- neurosis of the vastus internus, and the tendons of the semitendinosus, gracilis and sartorius, are fixed. The lowest part of this surface is therefore the place where the tibia ought to be sawed through in an amputation, to preserve its motions, by saving the proper muscles. Below the exter- nal edge of the upper end of the tibia, there is a circular flat surface covered in a recent subject with cartilage, for the articulation of the fibu- la ;â€”between which, and the anterior knob, there is a rough hollow, from which the tibialis anticus, and extensor digitorum longus, take their origin. From the smooth flat surface, a ridge runs ob- liquely downwards and inwards, to give rise to part of the solaeus, tibialis posticus, and flexor di- gitorum longus, and insertion to the aponeurosis of the semimembranosus which covers the popli- tocus, and to some of the external fibres of this last named muscle. At the inside of this ridge, an oblique plain surface is left, where the greatest part of the musculus poplitaeus is inserted. The remaining body of the tibia is triangular. The anterior angle is very sharp, and is commonly called the spine or sJiin *. This ridge is not * Axxitet, Spina, crea, linea prima tibiae, angulus acutns.

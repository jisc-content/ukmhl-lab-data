There was consequently no deficiency of the animal pe- culiar to them. This circumstance accounts for the much smaller proportion of earth in these than in the preceding sound bones. The bones of the lower extremity appeared to be saturated with this fluid; those of the head seemed almost entirely free from it; hence, too, the much smaller pro- portion of earth in the former than in the latter. It is worthy of remark, that the fibrous part of the vertebra, in the last table, was very flexible, notwithstanding the considerable proportion of phosphat of lime present. It may be proper also to notice, that the enamel of the tooth of the mam- moth was of singular hardness, sufficiently hard, indeed, to scratch glass ; and yet, when deprived of its animal matter, of its cement, by calcina- tion, it was more friable than any of the other bones. 1 endeavoured to ascertain if this enamel contained fluoric acid, but I could not detect its presence. “ To conclude ; If the preceding results do not allow any general conclusion to be formed from them, they at least seem to shew that former in-

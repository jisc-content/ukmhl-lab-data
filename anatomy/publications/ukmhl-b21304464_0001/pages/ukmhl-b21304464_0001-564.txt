S36 OUTtlNES OF ANATOMY, By this muscle, the first joint of the great toe is bent. Calco-Sub-Phalangeus Minimi Digiti, or Ab^ ductor Minimi Digiti. This muscle extends between the under protu- berance of the os calcis, the root of the metatarsal bone of the little toe, and the outer part of the root of the first bone of the little toe. By this muscle, the little toe is drawn out- wards. Tarso-Sub-Phalangeus Minimi Digiti, or Flexor Brevis Alinimi Digiti. This muscle extends between the cuboid bone, the outer and back part of the matatarsal bone of the little toe, and the anterior extremity of the metatarsal bone, and root of the first bone of the little toe. This muscle assists in bending the little toe.

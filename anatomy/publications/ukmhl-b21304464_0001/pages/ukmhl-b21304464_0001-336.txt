Besides these pairs of processes, there is a sharp ridge which stands out from the middle of its base, hence called pi'ocessus azy- gos. The lower part of this process, where it is received into the vomer, is thick, and often not quite perpendicular, but inclining more to one side than the other. The fore-part of this pro- cess, where it joins the nasal plate of the os eth- moides, is thin and straight. These two parts have been described as two distinct processes by some. The depressions, sinuosities and fossae, on the ex- ternal surface of this sphenoid bone, are two on the temporal apophyses where the crotaphite muscles lodge: Two on the orbitar processes, to make way for the globes of the eyes; Two between the temporal and spinous processes, for receiving the temporal bones: Two between the plates of the pterygoid processes, where the musculi ptery- goidei interni and ptery staphylini interni are placed : Two between the pterygoid and orbitar processes, for forming the holes, common to this, and to the cheek and maxillary bones : Two on the lower ends of the aliform processes, which the palate bones enter into : Two at the roots of the * Aldin.

318 OUTLINES or ANATOMY. The second and third are the lateral nasal*, which are at each side of the nose, and almost â€¢ * parallel to the first suture. Each of the two lacrymal is almost semicircular, and is placed round the lacrymal groove. The sixth and seventh are the internal orbitar ; each of which is extended obliquely from tlie mid- dle of the lower side of an orbit to the edge of its base. The two external orbitars are continued, each from the end of the internal orbitar, to the under and fore part of the cheek. The tenth is the mystachial, which reaches only from the lower part of the septum narium, to be- tween the two middle dentes incisores. The longitudinal palate f suture stretches from the middle of the foremost teeth through the mid- dle of all the palate. The transverse palate one | runs across the palate, nearer the back than the fore-part of it. Each of the two palato-maxillary is at the back- part of the side of each nostril. The fifteenth is the spinous, which is in the middle of the lower part of the nostrils. This may, perhaps, be rather thought a double schin- dylesis. * Naaalis obliqua. t Laquearis, palataria recta, J Arcuata, palatina postica.

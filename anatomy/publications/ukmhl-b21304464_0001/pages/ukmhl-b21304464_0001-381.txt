353 or THE FORM OF THE SKULL. Explanation of Plate XVI. This plate, which was copied from a drawing by my able assistant and friend Mr Fyfe, repre- sents accurate outlines of the skull-caps of five skulls of Britons, in order to point out the differ- ences as to their form. The figures placed upon the outlines of the dif- ferent skull-caps, sufficiently distinguish the one skull-cap from another. I also requested of Dr W. E. Leach to measure several of the skulls in my possession, of different nations, craniometer invented by himself^*; with which request he readily complied, and made out for me the following table: â€¢ Dr Leach proposes, in the Edinburgh Encyclopaedia, to publish an account of his craniometer, which is extremely well adapted for measuring the different angles of the skull.

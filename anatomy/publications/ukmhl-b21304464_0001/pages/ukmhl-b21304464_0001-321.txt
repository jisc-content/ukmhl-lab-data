OF THE OS OCCIPITIS, 2^3 appended, or other force appl^pd, to pull the head back. Somewhat more externally than the condyles, there is a small rising and semilunated hollow in <2ach side, which make up part of the holes, com- mon to the occipital and petrous bones. Immediately behind this, on each side, a sca- brous ridge is extended .from the middle of the condyle, towards the root of the mastoid process. Into this ridge the musculus lateralis is inserted. About the middle of the external convex surface, / a large arch runs cross the bone ; from the upper lateral parts of which the occipital muscles have their rise ; to its middle the trapezii are attached ; and half way between this and the great hole, a lesser arch is extended. In the hollows between the middle of these arches, the complex! are inserted ; and in the de- pressions more external and further forward than these, the splenii are inserted. Between the middle of the lesser arch and the great hole, the little hollow marks of the recti minores appear ; and on each side of these, the fleshy insertions of the obliqui superiores and recti majores make depressions. Through the middle of the two arches a small sharp spine is placed, which serves as a sort of partition between the muscles of different sides, or rather is owing to the action of the muscles depressing the bone on each side of it, while this part is free from their compression.

OF THE RIBS. Q39 two planes are joined to the bodies of two diffe- rent vertebrae, and the ridge forces itself into the intervening cartilage. A little way from this head, we find, on the external surface, a small cavity, where glands are lodged *, and round the head, the bone appears spongy, where the capsular ligament of the articulation is fixed. Immediate- ly beyond this a flatted tubercle rises, with a small cavity at, and roughness about its root, for the ar- ticulation of the rib with the transverse process of the lowest of the two vertebrae, with the bodies of which the head of the rib is joined. Advancing further on this external surface, we observe in most of the ribs another smaller tubercle, into which ligaments which connect the ribs to each other, and to the transverse process^ of the ver- tebras and portions of the longissimus dorsi, are inserted. Beyond this the ribs are made flat by the sacro-lumbalis muscle, which is inserted into the part of this flat surface farthest from the spine, where each rib makes a considerable curve, called by some its angle. Then the rib begins to turn broad, and continues so to its anterior end *, which is hollow and spongy, for the reception of, and firm coalition with the cartilage that runs thence to be inserted into the sternum, or to be joined with some other cartilage. ^ In adults generally the cavity at this end of the ribs is smooth and polished on its surface; by ^ riA«T»?, PalnuJa,

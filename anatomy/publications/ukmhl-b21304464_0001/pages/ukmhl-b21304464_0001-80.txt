52 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. from the epiphyses on the othet, till at last, in adults, the place of their conjunction can scarcely be seen on the external surface and it is only * sometimes that we can then see any mark of di- stinction in the cancelli *. Several processes (c.g. trochanters of the thigh, spine of the scapula, &.c.) have epiphyses; and processes frequently rise out from epiphyses; for example, at the lower end of the femur, ulna, tibia, &cf. The epiphyses are united chiefly to such bones as are destined for frequent and violent motion ; and-for this purpose they are wisely framed of a larger diameter than the bone they belong to; thus the surface of contact between the two bones of any articulation being increased, their conjunc- tion becomes firmer, and the muscles inserted in- to'them act with greater force, by reason of their axes being further removed from the centre of motion. These advantages might indeed have been obtained by the expansion of the end of the bone itself, to a diameter equal to that of the epi- physes ; but then the constant separation of new plates to form so wide a cellular structure, must have left the solid sides of the bones so thin, as to yield easily, either to the action of-the muscles fixed to them, and passing over them, to the * Winslow, Exposition Anatomiquc cle Corps Humain, Traits des Os secs, ยง 116\ t Vcsal.

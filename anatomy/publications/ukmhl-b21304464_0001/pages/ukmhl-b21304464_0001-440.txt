OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 412 The base, acromion, coracoid process, and head of the scapula, are all in a cartilaginous stateatbirth ; and the three first are joined as epiphyses ; while the head, with the glenoid cavity, is not formed into a distinct separate bone, hut is gradually pro- duced by the ossification of the body of this bone being continued forwards. OJ the Os Humeri. i The Arm has only one bone, called os humeri', which is long, round, and nearly straight. At the upper end of this bone there is a large round smooth head, whose middle point is not in a straight line with the axis of the bone, but stands obliquely backwards from it, and it is bounded by a circular fossa, into which the cap- sular ligament of the joint is fixed. Below the fore-part of its base, two tubercles stand out: The smaller, which is situated most to the in- side *, has the tendon of the subscapularis muscle inserted into it. The larger more external pro- tuberance is divided, at its upper part, into three smooth plain surfaces: Into the anterior of which, the musculus supra-sphiatus; into the middle or largest, the infraspinatus; into the one behind, * The humenis is supposed to be viewed in the pendulous position with tlie palm of the hand directed forwards. In this position, those parts that look towards the radius, are external; those towards the ulna internal; those towards the palm anterior; and those towards the elbow posterior.

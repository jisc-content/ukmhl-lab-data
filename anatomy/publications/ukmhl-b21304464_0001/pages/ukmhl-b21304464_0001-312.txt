Hence this process has been named Its upper edge has the strong aponeurosis of the temporal muscle fix- ed into it; and its lower part gives rise to a share of the massetC7\ The fore-part of the base of this process is an oblong tubercle, which in a recent subject is covered with a smooth’ polished carti- lage, continued from that which lines the cavity immediately behind this tubercle. From the under craggy part of the os tempoi'um, the third process stands out obliquely forwards. The shape of it is generally said to resemble the ancient stylus scriptorius ; and therefore it is cal- led the styloid process f. Some authors however contend, that it ought to be named stdoid, from its being more like to a pillar. Several muscles have their origin from this process, and borrow one-half of their name from it; as stylo-glossus, stylo-hyoideus, stylo-pharyngms ; to it a ligament of the os hyoides is sometimes fixed ; and another is extended from it to the inside of the angle of the lower jaw. This process is often even in adults not entire- ly ossified, but is ligamentous at its root, and some- • Paris, ansae ossiura temporum, ossa arcualia, paria, jugalia, conjugalia.

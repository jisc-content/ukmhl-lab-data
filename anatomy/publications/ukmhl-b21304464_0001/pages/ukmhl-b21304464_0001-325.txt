297 OF THE OS OCCIPITIS. of these holes; in some heads I have seen'this membrane ossified, or a bony partition dividing each hole ; and, in the greater number of adult skulls, there is a small sharp-pointed process stands out from the os petrosum, and a more obtuse rising in the occipital bone, between which the partition is stretched. Behind this partition, where the largest space is left, the lateral sinus has its passage; and before it the eighth pair of nerves and accessorius make their exit out of the skull; and some authors say, an artery passes through this hole, to be bestowed on the dura mater. â€¢ The occipital bone is among the thickest of the cranium, though unequally so ; for it is stronger above, where it has no other defence than the common teguments, than it is below, where, being pressed by the lobes of the brain and cerebellum on one side, and by the action of the muscles on the other, it is so very thin, as to be diaphanous in many skulls; but then these muscles ward off injuries, and the ridges and spines, which are frequent here, make it sufficiently strong to resist ordinary forces. The tables and diploe are tolerably distinct in this bone, except where it is so thin as to become diaphanous. The occipital bone is joined above to the ossa parietalia and triquetra when present, at the lambdoid suture ; laterally to the temporal bones, by the additamenta ot the lambdoid suture j be- low to the sphenoid bone, by the end of its cunei-?

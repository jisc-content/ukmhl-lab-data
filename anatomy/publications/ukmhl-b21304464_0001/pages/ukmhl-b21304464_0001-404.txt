This craniometer consists of four pieces of wood or brass, divided into inches, and properly subdivided, and one of which may be moved either in a hori- zontal or in a perpendicular direction ; and for the sake of still greater accuracy, a Nonius or Ver- nier is added to one of the sides. Holes are per- forated at each inch or half inch of the sides of the instrument, for the purpose of affixing silk threads, which are stretched from one side of the instrument to the other, by which a number of small squares are formed. By placing a skull be- hind these squares, as in plate xx. A. the form of the skull is seen with accuracy by dividing pa- per in a similar way. It may be copied, or reduced with mathematical accuracy, and every deviation from the most common shape, may be traced and represented on paper, by one who has attained but little proficiency as a draughtsman.

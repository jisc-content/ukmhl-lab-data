223 OF THE SPINE. ther ridge of the os pubis, forms a line of partition between the abdomen and pelvis. Into this ridge the broad tendon of the psoas parvus is inserted. The internal surface of the os ilium, behind this ridge, is very unequal ; For the upper part is flat, , but spongy, where the sacrolumbalis and longissi- mus dorsi rise. Lower down, there is a transverse ridge from which ligaments go out to the os sacrum. . Imme- diately below this ridge, the rough unequal cavi- ties and prominences are placed, which are exact- ly adapted to those dekribed on the side of the os sacrum. In the same manner, the upper , part of this rough surface is porous, for the firmer adhesion of the ligamentous cellular substance; while the lower part is more solid, and covered with a thin cartilaginous skin, for its immoveable articulation with the os sacrum. From the circumference of this large unequal surface, ligaments are extended to the os sacrum, to secure more firmly the con- junction of these bones. The passages of the medullary vessels are very conspicuous, both in the dorsum and costa of ma- ny ossa ilia ; but in others they are inconsider- able. The posterior and lower parts of these bones are thick ; but they are generally exceedingly thin and compact at their middle, where they^ are exposed to the actions of the musculi glutaei

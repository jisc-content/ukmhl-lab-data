The Metatarsus *, is composed of five bones, which, in their general characters, agree with the metacarpal bones •, but may be distinguished from them by the following marks: 1. They are long- er, thicker, and stronger. 2. Their anterior round ends are not so broad, and are less in pro- portion to their bases. 3.

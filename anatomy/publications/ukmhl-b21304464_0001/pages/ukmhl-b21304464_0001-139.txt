Ill OBLIC^E MUSCLES. to each other, in the top of a wall CD, and let two other pullies EF be fixed to the wall at double the distance from each other of the per- pendicular height of the first pair of pullies above the second pair â€¢, that is, let the length of the ho- rizontal line EF be double to that of the perpen- dicular line EC or CD. If a rope GHIK be now passed over the four pullies, and two weights L, M hung to its ends, it will be found, that the single weight N, of the same kind and bulk, hook- ed on the middle of the rope, as at O, will ba- lance both the other weights L and M ; because, as the oblique ropes H and I evidently pull in- wards in the direction of the horizontal line EF, as much as in the direction of the perpendicular lines EC and FD, they lose one-half of their ef- fects of elevating the weights. In all examples, therefore, where a space be- tween two parallel lines or bones, such as the ribs, is filled up with muscular fibres, there will be a greater number of fibres when they run transverse- ly than when they are placed obliquely, and they will besides act with more force; And, even when we suppose the number of fibres in two muscles so situated to be equal, the muscle with straight fibres w'ill be stronger than the oblique one, in the proportion exactly which the length of the oblique fibre bears to the straight or per- pendicular one. Hence, in all such cases, some advantages very dillerent from an increase of strength, must be gained by the obliquity.

OF THE SCAPULA. 411 anterior half of it; and in some old subjects I have found a sesamoid bone here*. The scapula is connected to the head, os hijoides, vertebrce, I'ibs, and aj'di-bone, by muscles, that have one end fast- ened to these bones, and the other to the scapula, which can move it upwards, downwards, back- wards, or forwards ; by the quick succession of these motions, its whole body is carried in a circle. But being also often moved, as upon an axis per-, pendicular to its plane, its circumference turns in a circle, whose centre this axis is f. Whichever of these motions it performs, it always carries the outer end of the clavicle and the arm along with it. The glenoid cavity of this bone receives the os humeri, which plays in it as a ball in a socket, as will be explained more hereafter. The scapula serves as a fulcrum to the arm ; and, by altering its position on different occa- sions, allows always the head of the os humeri a right situated socket to move in ; and thereby extends the sphere of motion of the superior extremity, and affords the muscles which rise from it more advantageous actions, by altering their directions to'the bone which they are to move. This bone also serves to defend the back- part of the thorax, and is often employed to sus- tain weights, or to resist forces, too great for the arm to bear. ^ Jac. Sylv. Isagog.

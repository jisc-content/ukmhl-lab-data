OF THE SPINE. 209 5. Betwixt the roots of the superior oblique and transverse processes, a small protuberance may be observed, where some of the muscles that raise the trunk of the body are inserted. 6. Their spinal processes are strong, straight, and horizontal, with broad flat sides, and a narrow edge above and below; this last being depressed on each side by muscles. And at the root of these edges, we see rough surfaces for fixing the ligaments. 7. The canal for the numerous cords, called cauda equina, into which the spinal marrow di- vides, is rather larger in these bones than what contains that marrmv in the vertebrae of the back. 8. The holes for the passage of the nerves are more equally formed out of both the conti- guous vertebrae than in the other classes ; the up- per one furnishes however the larger share of each hole. The thick cartilages between these lumbar ver- tehrce, their deep oblique processes, and their erect spinal processes, are all fit for allowing large motion â€¢, though'it is not so great as what is per- tormed in the neck *, which appears from compar- ing the arches which the head describes when moving on the neck, or the loins only^ The lumbar vertebrce as they descend, have their oblique processes at a greater distance from each other, and facing more backwards and for- wards. Both transverse and spinal processes of the O VOL. I.

OF THE OS TRAPEZOIDES. It has a small hollow surface above, by which it joins the scaphoides ; a long convex one internal- ly, where it is contiguous to the trapezium ; a small external one, for its conjunction with the os magnum j and an inferior convex surface, the edges of which are however so raised before and behind, that a sort of pulley is formed, where it sustains the os metacarpi indicis. Of the Os Magnum. The Os Magnum * so called because it is the largest bone of the carpus, is oblong, having four quadrangular sides, with a round upper end, and a triangular plain one below. The round head is divided by a small rising, opposite to the connexion of the os scaphoides and lunare, which together form the cavity for receiv- ing it. On the inside, a short plain surface joins the os magnum to the trapezoides. On the outside is a long narrow concave sur- face, where it is contiguous to the os unciforme. The lower end, which sustains the metacarpal bone of the middle finger, is triangular, slightly hollowed, and farther advanced on the internal side than on the external, having a considerable oblong depression made on the advanced inside by the metacarpal bone of the fore-finger ; and gene- voL 1.

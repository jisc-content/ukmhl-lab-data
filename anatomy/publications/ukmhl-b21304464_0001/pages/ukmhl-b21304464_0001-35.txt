OSTEOLOGY.' 7 a natural skeletmi; and when united by wires, an artificial skeleton. In the animal kingdom, there is much variety in the form of the skeleton, and disposition of its component parts. In many animals, the skeleton is external, form- ing a fixed basis on which the muscles act, and also a case within which the animal retreats. The human skeleton, on the contrary, is inter- nal, that is, covered by soft parts ; but though thus covered, the bones appear obscurely through ihany of the superincumbent parts, so as to form the outline, and to give a certain character to the body. There is a difference in regard to the size of the bones of the skeleton, in different individuals even of the same age, of the same sex, and of the same country ; and a still more striking variety at dif- ferent periods of life, in the different sexes, and among the inhabitants of different countries. Purposes to which the Skeleton is subsei'vient. 1. The skeleton is the foundation on which the \vhole fabric is built. It is the basis to which ail the other parts are directly or indirectly con- nected, and to these it gives stability and sup- port. 2. The bones defend from external injury the brain, heart, lungs, and other organs, on which life more immediately depends; and also many of the larger bloodvessels and nerves. A4

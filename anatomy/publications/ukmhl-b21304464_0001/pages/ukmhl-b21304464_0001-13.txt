PREFACE. Vll ken from my grandfather’s “ Osteology —a book which is now ranked as one of the classics in Anatomical Science, and though published near- ly a century ago, still retains its celebrity. It may not, however, be improper to remark, that, in reprinting the “ Osteology,” I was under the necessity of making several alterations and additions, and especially ih the Physiological and Pathological departments; on which the pu- blic may not be disposed to place the less value, when it is stated, that, independently of those suggested by my own experience and observation, and the present advanced state of Anatomical Science, many of them were derived from an original Commentary, written by my Grandfather for the use of his sons, and from the lectures of my Father. Descriptions in language, however carefully drawn up, being inadequate to convey distinct ideas on many points of Anatomy, a number of engravings from the drawings of the most cele- brated draughtsmen, jMjchael Angelo Buo- NARoni, Dr P. Campfr, Messrs Fyfe, Dizars ^nd Syme, are affixed to these Outlines.

OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 254 1 he power that raises this bone and the carti- lages, fixes them sufficiently to make them resist the action of the diaphragm, whose fibres contract at the same time, and thrust the viscera of the ab- domen downwards. The arched part of the ribs being thus moved outwards, their anterior ends and the sternum being advanced forwards, and the diaphragm being brought nearer to a plane surface, instead of being greatly convex on each side within each cavity of the thorax ; it is evi- dent how considerably the cavity, of which the nine or ten upper ribs are the sides, must be widen- ed, and made deeper and longer. While this is doing in the upper ribs, the lower ones, whose cartilages are not joined to the ster- num or to other cartilages, move very dift'erently, though they conspire to the same intention, the enlargement of the thorax ; For having no fixed point to which their anterior ends arc fastened, and the diaphragm being inserted into them at the place where it runs pretty straight upwards from its origin at the vertebrae, these ribs are drawn downwards by this strong muscle, and by the muscles of the abdomen, which, at this time, are resisting the stretching force of the bowels; while the intercostal muscles are pulling them in the contrary direction, to wit, upwards; The ef- fect therefore of either of these powers, which are antagonists to each other, is very little, as to moving the ribs either up or down ; but the muscles of the abdomen, pushed at this time out-

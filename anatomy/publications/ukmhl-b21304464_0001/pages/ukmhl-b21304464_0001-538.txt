5lO OUTLINES OF ANATOMY/ cuneiforme behind, where it is joined to the os naviculare, is hollow, smooth, and of a circular figure below, but pointed above. The external side consists of two smooth and flat surfaces, whose direction is nearly at right angles with each other. With the posterior, that runs obliquely from be- low forwards and upwards, the os cuneiforme mi- nimum is joined ; and with the anterior, whose direction is longitudinal, the os metatarsi of the toe next to the great one is connected. The fore- part of this bone is semilunar, but flat and smooth, for sustaining the os metatarsi of the great toe. The internal side is scabrous, with two remarkable tubercles below, from which the musculus abductor pollicis rises ; and the tibialis anticus is inserted into its upper part. The three cuneiform bones are all so secured by ligaments, that very little motion is allowed in any of them, and they are cartilaginous in a foetus of nine months. These seven bones of the tarsus, when joined, are convex above, and concave below ; thus the several muscles, tendons, and vessels, that lie in the sole of the foot, are safely lodged. And in the re- cent subject, their upper and lower surfaces are covered, and strongly united by other strong ligaments. Notwithstanding the many surfaces co- vered with cartilage, some of which are of the form of the very moveable articulations, no more motion is here allowed, than only to prevent too

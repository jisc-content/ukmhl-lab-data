OF THE OS ETHMOIDES. 303 a small notch or two may sometimes be observed, which go to the formation of the internal orbitar holes, as was remarked in the description of the frontal-bone. Below the cells of each side, a thin plate is ex- tended inwards, and then bending down, it be- comes thick and of a spongy texture. This spongy part is triangular, with a straight up- per edge placed horizontally, an anterior one slanting from above, downwards and forwards, and with a pendulous convex one below. The upper and lower edges terminate in a sharp point be- hind. The side of this pendulous spongy part next to the septum narium is convex, and its external side is concave. These two processes of the ethmoid bone, have got the name of ossa spongiosa, or tiir- hinaia superiora, from their substance, figure, and situation. The prominencies, and cavities of this ethmoid bone, are covered with a continuation of the mem- brane of the nostrils, in a recent subject. Its horizontal cribriform plate is lodged between the orbitar processes of the frontal-bone, to which it is joined at the ethmoid suture, except at the back-part where it is connected with the cuneiform- bone, by a suture common to both these bones, though it is generally esteemed part of the sphe- noidal. Where the ossa plana are contiguous to the fron-

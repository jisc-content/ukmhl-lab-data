This’ coagulated blood, or in- cipient callus, in a short time becomes vascular, and is covered by a new-formed periosteum, which adheres to the original periosteum, after which the process of ossification takes place. But so much violence was offered, and many of the arteries torn in breaking the bones, that Dr Macdonald’s experiments have not been supposed to be conclu- sive. It has occurred to me, that, by examining the bones during their growth in the chronic form of hydrocephalus, we might determine whether lymph or blood be effused before bone is deposit- ed ; and in several such cases, I have seen the bony fibres, shooting towards the circumference of the bones in a red-coloured lymph. Is Bone formed xvithin Cartilage^ or betxceen Mem- hranes ? It has been matter of dispute whether bone js formed within cartilage, or rather within jelly *, or Dr Macdonald’s experiments seem to me to have proved, that what has been commonly stated to be cartilage, is either jelly or s6ft bone. He has justly observed : " Quemadmodum “ vero gelatinosa materia in cartilagincm convertatur, Hallerus, “ pariter atque auctores qui ante eum florebant, in errorem in- “ cidit.

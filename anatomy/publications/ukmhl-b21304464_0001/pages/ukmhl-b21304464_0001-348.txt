OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 320 and becoming somewhat larger at the top, where they are ragged and thickest, and have a curva- ture forwards, that their connexion with the frontal bone might be stronger. These bones are convex externally, and thereby better resist any violence from without; and they are concave in- ternally, for enlarging the cavity of the nose. The lower edge of these bones is unequal, and is stretched outwards and backwards, to join the cartilages of the nostrils. Their anterior side is thick, especially above, and unequal, that their conjunction to each other might be stronger ; and a small rising may be remarked on their inner edge, where .they are sustained by the septum narium. Their posterior side, at its upper half, has externally a depression, where it is overlopped some way by the maxillary bones, while its lower half covers these bones : By which contrivance, they do not yield easily to pressure applied to their fore-part or sides'. A small hole is frequently to be observed on their external surface, into which two, three, or four holes, which appear internally, terminate, for the transmission of small veins; sometimes the holes go no farther than the cancelli of the hones. The nasal bones are firm and solid, with very few cells or cancelli in them ; the thin sub- stance, of which they consist, not requiring much marrow.

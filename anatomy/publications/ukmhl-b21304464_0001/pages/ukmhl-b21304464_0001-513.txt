OF THE THIGH. 485 frequently thrust out at the breach of the brims on the inside, which allows the thigh to move con- siderably inwards. The body of this bone has little or no rotatory motion, though the head most commonly moves round its own axis ; because the oblique progress of the neck and head from the bone is such, that the rotatory motion of the head can only bring the body of the bone forwards and backwards: Nor is this head, as in the arm, ever capable of being brought to a straight direction with its body ; so far, however, as the head can move within the cavity backwards and forwards, the rest of the bone may have a partial rotation. The os fiemoris is articulated below to the tibia and rotula. The nearness of the small neck to the round head of the thigh-bone, and its upper end being covered with very thick muscles, make greater difficulty in distinguishing between a luxation and fracture here, than in any other part of the body. Of the Leg, The Leg * is composed, according to the com- mon account, of two bones, tibia and fibula: a third, the rotula, may be added, from the strong Hh3 â€¢ Crus, tibia.

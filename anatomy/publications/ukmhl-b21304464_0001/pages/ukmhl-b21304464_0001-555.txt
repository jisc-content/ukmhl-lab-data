Pubo-Pretibialis, or Gracilis. . This muscle arises from the lower part of the symphysis pubis, and descends along the inner side of the thigh, and is inserted into the tibia be- low the sartorius muscle. The use of this muscle is to assist in the flexion of the knee, after it has been bent by the flexors of the leg. .

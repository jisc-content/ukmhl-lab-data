HP HE LIGAMENTS are compact, strong and flexible ^ membranes, and possess but a small share of elas- ticity. The ligaments are composed of two layers: the outer layer is considerably thicker than the inner, upon which the smaller ramifications of the arteries are distributed, which form a part of ttie synovia of the joint. The ligaments are of a fibrpus structure: in some cases, these are disposed in a parallel man- ner with respect to each other j but in othersi, they interlace each other.

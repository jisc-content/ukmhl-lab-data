GF THK SKULL. 2i7 vered with the pericranium, the thin frontal and occipital muscles, their tendinous aponeuroses, and with the common teguments of the body *, while the external surface of its lower part has nume- rous risings, depressions and holes, which afford convenient origin and insertion to the muscles that are connected to it, and allow safe passage for the vessels and nerves that run through and near it. The internal surface of the upper part of the skull is commonly smooth, except where the ves- sels of the dura mater have made furrows in it, while the bones were soft. Surgeons should be cautious when they trepan here, lest, in sawing or raising the bone where such furrows are, they wound these vessels. In the upper part of the internal surface of se- veral skulls, there are likewise pits of different magnitudes and figures, which seem to be formed by some parts of the brain being more luxuriant and prominent tiian others, and also by little bo- dies growing from the dura mater. Where these pits are, the skull is much thinner than any where else, and often rendered diaphanous, the two tables being closely compacted without a diploe; the want of which is supplied by vessels going from the dura mater into a great many small holes observ- able in the pits. These vessels are larger, and much more con- spicuous than any others that are sent from the dura mater to the skull; as evidently appears

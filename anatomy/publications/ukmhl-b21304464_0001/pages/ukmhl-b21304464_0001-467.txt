439 or THE METACARPUS. The metacarpal bones are joined above to the ossa carpi, and to each other by nearly plain sur- faces. The movements of these bones are there- fore limited. The articulation of their round heads at the lower ends with the cavities of the first bones of the fingers, is to be taken notice of hereafter. The metacarpal bones are concave towards the palm of the hand, and their basis form the arch of the carpus. The spaces between them lodge ^muscles, and their small motion makes them fit supporters for the fingers to play on. The ossa metacarpi may be distinguished from each other by the following marks. The os metacarpi indicis is generally the longest. Its base, which is articulated with the os trape- zoides, is hollow in the middle. The small ridge on the internal side of this ob- long cavity is smaller than the one opposite to it, and is made flat on the side by the trapezium. The exterior ridge is also smooth, and flat on its outside, for its conjunction with the os mag- num ; immediately below which a semicircular smooth flat surface shews the articulation of this to the second metacarpal bone. The back-part of this base is flatted. Wâ€™here the long head of the extensor carpi radialis* is insert- ed ; and its fore-part is prominent, w^here the ten- don of the flexor carpi radialis is fixed. Ee4 * Radialis externus.

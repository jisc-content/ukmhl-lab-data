507 OF THE OS CUBOIDES. Of the Os Cuboides. The Os Cuboides* is a very irregular -cube. Behind, it is formed into an oblong unequal con- cavity, adapted to the fore-part of the os calcis. There is a small semicircular smooth cavity on the inner side of this bone, where it is joined to the os naviculare ; immediately before which, an oblong smooth plane is made by the os cunei- forme externum. Below this, the bone is hollow and rough. On the internal side of the lower surface, a round protuberance and fossa are found, where the musculus adductor pollicis has its origin. On the external side of this same surface, there is a round knob, covered with cartilage ; immediately before which, a smooth fossa maybe observed, in which the tendon of the peronjeus primus runs obliquely cross the foot; and on the knob, the thin flat cartilage proper to this muscle plays; in place of which sometimes a bone is found ; More externally than the knob, a rough hollow is made, for the strong ligaments stretched betwixt this bone and the os calcis. Before, the surface of the os cuboides is flat, smooth, and slightly divided into two planes, for sustaining the os metatarsi of the little toe, and of the toe next to it. \ * cubiforme, quadratum, grandinosum, varium< toafiarae, multi foniie.

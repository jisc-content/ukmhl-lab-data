OSTEOLOGY. 45 tendinous fibres of the muscles expanded on the periosteum *. Vessels also pass through the periosteum to the marrow ; of which more hereafter. And fre* quently muscles, ligaments, or cartilages, pierce through the periosteum, to be inserted into the bones. The uses of the periosteum are ; 1. To allow the muscles, when they contract or are stretched, to move and slide easily upon the bones ; the smooth surface of this membrane pre- venting any ill effects of their friction upon each other. 2. To support the vessels in their passage to the bones. 3. To strengthen the conjunction of the bones with their epiphyses, ligaments, and cartilages, which are easily separated in young creatures, when this membrane is taken away. 4. To afford convenient origin and insertion to several muscles which are fixed to this mem- brane. 5. To assist in forming bone. When the cellular substance connecting the pe- riosteum to the surrounding parts is destroyed, • See the dispute about the sensibility of this and of other membranes in Zimmerman.

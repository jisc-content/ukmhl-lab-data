OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 78 CHAPTER V. General observations on the synovia. T' HE joints are lubricated by a quantity of a fluid called Synovia. This fluid is, in most cases, as transparent as fresh made olive oil, but in others, it has a yellow hue, like olive oil which has been kept for some time. The synovia is somewhat like the white of egg in consistence, and, like it, when agitated, froths. My Father, in his treatise upon the Bursae Mu- cosae, has made the following observations upon, the synovia : “ Immediately after an ox was killed, I opened the joints and large bursae of the legs, and collect- ed the liquors they contained. “ These were similar to each other in colour, smell, taste, consistence and weight, and gave the same degree of slipperiness when rubbed between the thumb and finger. “ When mixed with oil of vitriol, diluted with double its weight of water, both liquors became demi-opaque, but were not coagulated.

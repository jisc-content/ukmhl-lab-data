81 SYNOVIA. , “ I have endeavoured to ascertain the propor- tions of its constituent parts ; but I have not been so successful as I could have wished, on account of the small quantity operated upon. “ 300 grains of it were immersed in boiling wa- ter, in a suitable glass vessel, for about ten mi- nutes. The coagulum thus formed was sepa- rated, and dried till very brittle. It weighed 1.4 grain. “ The fluid, after the removal of the coagulated albumen, was almost transparent. When nearly evaporated to dryness, the little remaining fluid ' did not gelatinize on cooling. The'dry residual matter weighed 3.5 grains. “ This residue and the albumen were heated to ■redness in a platina crucible. The charcoal pro- duced was digested in water. The solution thus formed was evaporated to dryness, and small cu- bic crystals of common salt were obtained, that weighed ^^th of a grain. As they shewed no tendency to deliquesce, though they rendered turmeric paper brown, it may be concluded that the quantity of alkali present was very small. “ The coal, after the separation of the common salt, was digested in dilute nitric acid. Ammonia aftertvards added, occasioned a slight cloudiness, indicating a very minute proportion only of phos- phate of lime. VOL. I. F

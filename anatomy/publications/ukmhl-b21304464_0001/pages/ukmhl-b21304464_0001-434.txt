The second process stands out from the fore-part of the upper side ; and, from its imaginary resem- blance to a crowâ€™s beak, is named coracoidcs *. The third process is the whole thick bulbous fore- part of the bone. After thus naming the several constituent parts of the scapula, the particular description will be more easily understood. The base, which is tipped with cartilage in a young subject, is not all straight; For above the spine, it runs obliquely forwards to the superior angle ; that here it might not be too protuberant backwards, and so bruise the muscles and tegu- ments : Into the oblique space, the musculus pa- tientiae is inserted. At the root of the spine, on the back-part of the base, a triangular plain sur- face is formed, by the pressure of the lower fibres of the trapey.ius. Below this the edge of the sca- pula is scabrous and rough, for the insertion of the serratus major anticus and rhomboid muscles. The back-part of the inferior angle is made smooth by the latissimus dorsi passing over it. This muscle also alters the direction of the infe- rior costa some way forwards from this angle ; and so far it is flatted behind by the origin of the teres major. As the inferior costa advances for- ward, it is of considerable thickness, is slightly hollowed, and made smooth behind by the teres minor, while it has a fossa formed into it below, * Anchoroides, sigmoides, digitalis ancistroides.

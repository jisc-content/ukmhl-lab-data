OF THE RADIUS. 425 cond joint of the thumb ; immediately above which, a little rough surface shews where the supinator radii longus is inserted. The ridges at the sides of the grooves, in which the tendons play, have an annular ligament fixed to them, by which the several sheaths for the tendons are formed. The fore-part of this end of the radius is also depressed, where the flexors of the fingers and flexor carpi radialis pass. The external side, is formed into a semilunated I smooth cavity, lined with a c&rtilage, for receiv- 1 ing the lower end of the ulna. The lowest part of the radius is formed into an • oblong cavity ; in the middle of which is a small (transverse rising, gently hollowed ; while the ri- ising itself is insinuated into the conjunction of I the two bones of the wrist that are received into ithe cavity. The internal side of this articulation is fenced Iby a remarkable process* of the radius, from (which a ligament goes out to the wrist, as the sty- lloid process of the ulna with its ligament guards iit on the outside. The ends of both of the bones of the fore-arm‘ Ibeing thicker than the middle, there is a consider- aable distance between the bodies of these bones; lin the larger part of which a strong tendinous, Ibut thin ligament is extended, to give a large cenough surface for the origin of the numerous * Malleolus intemus, processus styloides.

OUTLIKES OF ANATOMY. 290 common to this bone and to the occipital and sphenoidal bones. The parts contained within the os petrosum of the skeleton, will be afterwards described. The temporal bones are joined above to the parietal bones by the squamous sutures, and their posterior additamenta; Before, to the sphenoid bone at the suture of that name ; to the cheek- bones at the zygomatic sutures; Behind, to the occipital bone, at the lambdoid suture and its ad- ditamenta ; and they are articulated with the low- er jaw, in the manner which shall be described whe 1 this bone is examined. In an infant, a small fissure is to be observed between the thin upper part, and the lower craggy part of each of these bones ; which points out the recent union of these parts. Neither mastoid nor styloid processes are 'yet to be seen. Instead of a bony funnel-like external meatus auditorius, there is only a smooth bony ring, within which the membrane of the drum is fastened. At the entry of the eustachian tube, the side of the tympanum is not completed. A little more outward than the internal auditory canal, there is a deep pit, over the upper part of whose orifice the intdrior semi- circular canal of the ear is stretched ; and some way below this, the posterior semicircular canal also appears manifestly. â€¢ For a.full description of the osseous part of the ear, Vid. vol. 3. of this work.

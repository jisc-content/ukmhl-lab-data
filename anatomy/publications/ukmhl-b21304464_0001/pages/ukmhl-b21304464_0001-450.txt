422 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. Between the back-part of that internal'smooth side and this process, a sinuosity is left for the tendon of the extensor carpi ulnaris. On the fore- part of the root of the process, such another de- pression may be remarked for the passage of the ulnar artery and nerve. The end of the bone is smooth, and covered with a cartilage. Between it and the bones of the wrist, a doubly concave moveable cartilage is interposed ; which is a continuation of the cartilage that covers the lower end of the radius, and is connected loosely to the root of the styloid process, and to the rough cavity there, in which mucilaginous glands are lodged. The ulna is articulated above with the lower end of the os humeri, where these bones have de- pressions and protuberances corresponding to each other, so as to allow an easy and secure extension of the fore-arm to almost a straight line with the arm, and flexion to a very acute angle ; but, by the slanting position of thq pully, the lower part of the fore-arm is turned outwards in the exten- sion, and inwards in the flexion * ; and a very small kind of rotation is likewise allowed in all positions, especially when the ligaments are most relaxed by the fore-arm being in a middle degree of flexion. The ulna is also articulated with the radius and carpus, in a manner to be related after- wards. ? Winslow, Memoires de Iâ€™Acad. dcs Sciences, 1722.

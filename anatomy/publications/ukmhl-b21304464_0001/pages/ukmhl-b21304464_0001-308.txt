On the inner concave surface of the parietal bones,* there are a great many deep furrows, dis- posed somewhat like the branches of trees; which are largest and deepest at the lower edge of each os parietale, especially near its anterior angle, where sometimes a full canal is formed : They afterwards divide into small furrows, in their pro- gress upwards. In some skulls, a large furrow be- gins at the hole near the upper edge, and divides into branches, which join with those which come upwards, shewing the communications of the up- per and lower vessels of the dura mater. In these furrows we frequently see passages into the diploe ; and sometimes I have observed canals going off, M^hich allowed a small probe to pass some inches into the bony substance. Some * tell us, that they, have observed these canals piercing the bone towards the occiput. On the inside of the upper edge of the ossa parietalia, there is a large sinuosi- ty, frequently larger in the bone of one side than of the other, where the upper part of the falx is fastened, and the superior longitudinal sinus is lodged. Generally, part of the lateral sinuses * CowPER, Anatam. Explic. of XC Tab. Fig. 1.

OF ‘THE PELVIS. 225 Between the upper part of this ligament and the bones, it was formerly observed that the pyriform muscle, the posterior criiral vessels, and the sciatic nerve, pass out of the pelvis. Immediately below this process, a sinuosity is formed for the tendon of the musculus obturator internus. In a recent subject, this part of the bone, which serves as a pully on which the obturator muscle plays, is co- vered with a ligamentous cartilage, that, by two or three small ridges, points out the interstices of the fibres in the tendon of this muscle. The out- er surface of the bone at the root of this spinous process is made hollow by the pyriformis or ilia- cus externus muscle. Below the sinuosity for the obturator muscle, is the grea^t knob or tuberosity, covered with carti- lage or tendon *. The upper part of the tubero- sity gives rise to the inferior gemellus muscle. To a ridge at the inside of this, the external or posterior sacrosciatic ligament is so fixed, that be- tween it, the internal ligament, and the sinuosity of the os ischium, a passage is left for the internal obturator muscle. The upper thick smooth part of the tuber, called by some its dorsum, has two oblique impressions on it. The inner one gives origin to the long head of the biceps flexor cruris and semitendinosus muscles, and the semimem- branosus rises from the exterior one, which reaches higher and nearer the acetabulum than the other. * Winslow, Exposit, Anat. des os frais, § Q6.

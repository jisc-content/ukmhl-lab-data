OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 76 The capsular ligaments are strengthened by- tendons, with which they are in many cases in- timately interwoven. The capsular ligaments are thinner under the muscles which cross them, than elsewhere,â€”a sufficient proof that the joint derives security from the muscles which pass over it. Besides, there are irregular ligamentous bands dispersed over the capsular ligaments, which add. considerably to their strength. But where the movements of the joints are more limited ; where flexion and extension only are performed, the capsular ligament is strengthened at its sides by the addition of ligamentous bands, which have been commonly called Lateral Liga- ments, and these are firmly interwoven with the periosteum. These lateral ligaments moderate and in some measure regulate the movements of the joints. The second class includes those ligaments which unite the bones, which do not move upon each other; as the os sacrum, and os innominatum. The thb'd class includes those ligaments which supply the place of tendons, and these possess a great- er share of elasticity than the other ligaments, and therefore save muscular power; such are the liga- ments between the spinous processes of the ver- tebrae. The. fourth class comprehends such ligaments as supply the place of hones ; as the ligaments which fill up the foramina obturatoria.

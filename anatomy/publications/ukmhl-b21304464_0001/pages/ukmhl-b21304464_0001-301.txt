OF THE OS FRONTIS. 27S the larger branches of the arteries of the dura mater, make some furrows in its sides and back parts. The sinuosities from the luxuriant risings of the brain, mentioned when describing the ge- neral structure of the cranium, are often very ob- servable on its upper part; and its lower and fore parts are marked with the contortions of the an- terior lobes of the brain. Through the middle of this internal surface, where always in children, and sometimes in old people, the bone is divided, either a ridge stands out, to which the upper edge of the falx is fast- ened, or a furrow runs, in which the upper side of the superior longitudinal sinus is lodged : on both these ^iccounts chirurgical authors justly dis- charge the application of the trepan here. The reason of this difference in skulls, is alleged by some authors to be this. That in thin skulls the % ridge strengthens the bones, and in thick ones there is no occasion for it. To this way of ac- counting for this phaenomenon, it may justly be objected, that generally very thick skulls have a large spine here, and frequently thin ones have only a furrow. Perhaps this variety may be ow- ing to the different times of complete ossilication of those parts in different subjects; For if the two sides of this bone meet before they arrive at their utmost extent of growth, they unite verv firmly, and all their fibres endeavour to stretch themselves out where the least resistance is, that is, between the hemispheres of the brain.

OF THE SHAPE OF THE SKULL. S&9 A a VOL I. of the cone being at the root of the nose, and the base of it at the upper part of the forehead. From the continuance of- the disease, owing to the water contained within the head elevating the bregma, and membrane between the parietal bones,, the form of the head is still farther changed ; its upper part becoming somewhat of a conical figure. During the progress of the ossification, and from the internal distention continuing to exert its in- fluence over the growing osseous fibres of the skull, which on account of their length and weakness, do not oppose as much resistance to the internal dis- tention as the centres of ossification ; hence the next change, is the bulging out of the bones at the sides of the prominences, which is the consequence of a very large collection of water wfithin the head, and only occurs when the disease has been of two or three years standing. The bones bulge out at the sides of the original centres of ossification of the pieces of the skull, Avhich form the hiost-resisting points ; and hence, ' in this stage of the disease, the prominences in the skull corresponding with the original centres of ossification of the pieces of the cranium, are less apparent than in the head of a child who has laboured under hydrocephalus for a few months only. It is hardly necessary to observe, that these changes in the form of the* head take place more rapidly in some cases than in others. '

There is a bursa, under the head of the os hu- meri. between it and the tendon of the teres major muscle and that bone. There is a bursa between the tendon of the la- tissimus dorsi and the os humeri. There is a large bursa between the acromion scapulae, the coracoid process, and capsular liga- ment of the shoulder-joint, and also a small bursa between the coracoid process and capsular liga- ment of the humerus; this, however, is sometimes wanting. There is a bursa above the tendon of the infra- spinatus, and teres major muscle. There is a bursa between the clavicle and cora- coid process of the scapula. There is a bursa between the subclavian muscle and first rib. There is a bursa between the clavicle and cora- coid process, where the former bone works on the coracoid process. There is a vaginal shaped bursa, which incloses the tendon of the long head of the scapulo-radialis muscle ; and there is a very small bursa placed under that part of the muscle which passes over the head of the os humeri; and a bursa is also placed under the tendon of the subscapularis mus- cle, which communicates with the cavity of the joint.

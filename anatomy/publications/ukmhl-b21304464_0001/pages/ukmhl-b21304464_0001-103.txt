LIGAMENTS. 75 The ligaments externally are rough, but inter- nally smooth, and lubricated by synovia. The ligaments are largely supplied with blood- vessels and nerves, which may be traced into their ' substance There are different kinds of ligaments, which, on account of their shape or situation, have been arranged into six classes. Thtjirst class comprehends the capsular' liga- ments. These ligaments serve for retaining the articular surfaces of the bones in contact, to which the ten- dons and muscles crossing the joints, (especially when in a state of contraction, and when there is the greatest risk of the bones being displaced), essentially contribute. The capsular ligaments are connected to the necks of the bones, or to that part where the bodies of the bones are joined with their epi- physes, and which, forming capsules including the joints, have been thence called capsular' liga- ments. The capsular ligaments are not of an uniform extent nor of equal thickness. The extent of the capsular ligament is propor- tioned to the degree of motion performed: thus, at the shoulder-joint, the capsular ligament is much longer than at the hip-joint, where the motions are much more limited. * Vid.

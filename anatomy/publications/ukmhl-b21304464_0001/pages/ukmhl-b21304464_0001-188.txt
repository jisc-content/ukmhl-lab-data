OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 100 None of the flat bones are much exposed to fracture, except those of the cranium. Both tables of the skull are generally fractured. Fracture is'often accompanied by depression of the skull; but in early life, the skull is sometimes depressed, but not fractured. Fractures of the skull generally extend upwards from the place on which the injury was received, but sometimes downwards, and across the base of the skull through the partes petrosae of the tempo- ral bones, from temple to temple. Fractures often extend further in the inner than the outer table of the skull, and sometimes follow the course of the principal artery of the dura mater, or, in infants, of the bony fibres. The clavicles and radii are much exposed, from their office, to fracture ; the former keeps the shoul- der and breast-bone at a proper distance, and is more or less affected by every movement of the extremity *, the other supports the hand. The clavicles are not only broken by violence, directly applied, but by shock communicated: thus, the clavicle is broken by falls on the shoulder, and also on the hands. The smaller irregular-shaped bones, as those at the wrist, and in the ancles and feet, may be crushed by a great weight, but can scarcely be said to be broken. Fractures take place at the middle, or towards the ei'tremities of the bones. Fractures are simple or complicated: in the for- mer, the injury is limited to the bone and peri- 1

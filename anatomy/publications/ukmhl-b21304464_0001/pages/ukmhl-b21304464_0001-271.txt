OF THE RIBS. 243 The superior of the two plain, or rather hollow surfaces, by which the ribs are articulated to the bodies of the vertebrae, gradually increases from the first to the fourth rib, and is diminished after that in each lower rib. The distance of their angles from the heads al- ways increases as they descend to the ninth, on account of the greater breadth of the sacrolumba- lis muscle *. The ribs are commonly divided into true and false, or into vertebral and sterno-vertebral. The true -j- costae are the seven upper ones of each side, the cartilages of which are all gradually long- er as the ribs descend, and are joined to the breast- bone ; so that being pressed constantly between two bones, they are flatted at both ends, and are thicker, harder, and more liable to ossify, than the other cartilages, that are not subject to so much pressure. These ribs include the heart and lungs; and therefore are the proper or true custodes of life. The cartilages of five inferior ribs of each side do not reach to the sternum ; and therefore, want- ing the resistance at their fore-part, they are pointed; and, on this account, having less pres- sure, their substance is softer.

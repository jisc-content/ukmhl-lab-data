MUSCLES OF THE ARM. 453 ■ This muscle pulls the humerus backwards and downwards, and also rolls it. The following muscles arise from the scapula, the three first roll the os humeri outwards, and the other two antagonize these. The two following muscles^ are covered by an aponeurosis extendi r.g between the costae, and spine of the scapula. Super-Scapulo-Trochitereus Parvus, or 5’m- pra-Spinatus. This muscle arises from that part of the scapula which is above the spine of the scapula, and from the spine and superior costa of the scapula, and its tendons pass under the acromion above the articu- lation, and are fixed into the anterior part of the great tuberosity of the humerus. This muscle also assists in raising the arm. Super-Scapulo-Trochitereus Magnus, or In- fra-Spinatiis. This muscle fills up the greater part of the. scapula, which is below the spine of that bone, the fibres of it are oblique in respect to its tendon, which is fixed into the middle part of the great- er tuberosity of the os humeri. This muscle assists in raising the arm, and rolls it outwards when raised. Ff3

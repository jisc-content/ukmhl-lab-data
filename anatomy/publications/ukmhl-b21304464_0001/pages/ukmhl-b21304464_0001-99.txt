CARTILAGE. The permanent cartilages are the Articular, In- terarticular, and Intervertebral, those of the Ex- ternal Ear, of the Nose, Eyelids, Larynx, and Windpipe. Of the Articular, or Ohducent Cartilages. Those cartilages which cover the extremities of the bones, and form the articulating surfaces, have been named ariiculatwg. or obducent cartilages. They are remarkably smooth on the surface, lubricated by synovia, and of unequal thickness, being thickest towards the centre. The fibres of this kind of cartilage are remark- ably small, and can be seen only after maceration for six or eight weeks in water; they then may be observed to be united at right angles in respect to the bone to which they are connected. These cartilages being remarkably elastic, tend to avert the bad effects of concussion. Of the Inter articular Cartilages. The term interarticular cartilage is descriptive of the situation of these cartilages, some of which are moveable, but others are immoveable. The interarticular cartilages are harder than the former, and are thinner in the centre than to- wards their circumference. The interarticular cartilages tend to increase the surfaces of application of the articulating sur- E -i

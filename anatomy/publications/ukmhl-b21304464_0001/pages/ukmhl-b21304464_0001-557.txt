529 MUSCLES OF THE ANCLE. ancle through a grooV^e in the tibia, and fixed in- to the os naviculare. By this muscle, the inner side of the foot is raised. ' Of the Muscles which arise from the Perone, or ' Fibula. Perone 0-Tar.seus, or Peroneus Longus. This muscle arises from the fore-part of the head of the fibula, and frorn the outer-part of the same bone. The muscular fibres are fixed into the tendon, like the plumage of a pen into its stalk. The ten- don of this muscle is lodged in a groove, formed by the malleolus externus ; it passes across the sole of the foot in a groove in the cuboid bone, and is fixed into the outside of the metatarsal bone of the great toe, and os cuneiforme internum. By this muscle, the foot is extended, and the inner edge of it turned downwards. Peroneo-Metatarseus Magnus, or Peroneus Brevis. This muscle takes its rise from the outer part of the fibula, and its tendon passes behind the outer ancle, in the same sheath with the preceding mus- cle, and is fixed into the external part of the me- tatarsal bone of the little toe. The use of this muscle is to pull the outer edge of the foot upwards. VOL. I. LI ^

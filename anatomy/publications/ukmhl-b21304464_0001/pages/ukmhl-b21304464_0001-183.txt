DISEASES or BONES. U5 Mollitm Ossium. The MoHities Ossium has been described as a primary disease \ but 1 believe it to be more fie- quently symptoma'ic. I have a preparation of the knee-joint of a young woman whose limb was amputated on account of a white sw’elling, the bones of which were so soft, that I divided them with a scalpel, without turning the edge of it. The bones of the foot are sometimes reduced to a similar state by scrofula ; and 1 have seen the middle of the humerus as flexible as thick leather which had been steeped in water for some time, which is supposed by some to be the effect of can- cer, by others of the osteo-sarcoma. The disease is therefore sometimes symptomatic, and peculiar to some bones of the body only : on other occa- sions, it has been described as a general disease. , “ Dissection. On making an incision through the integuments, which were every where extremely thin, and on dividing the tumor from one extremity to the other, it was found to he composed of a substance very much resembling bony callus ; hut in many places, the tumor was of a solid texture, and could not be di- vided but by a saw. The cells of this callus-like substance were -filled with matter somewhat of the consistence of soft cheese. The tumor adhered every where strongly to the out- side of the os humeri, which was completely diseased from one extremity to the other, and somewhat* enlarged. The upper part of the tumor seemed also attached to the acromion process of the scapula, as well as to the distant extremity of the clavicle, and there was moreover a complete anchylosis of the shoulder*? joint.

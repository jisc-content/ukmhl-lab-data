OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 250 long cavity, that, in viewing it transversely from before backwards, appears a little convex ; Into these glenae, the ends of the clavicles are receiv- ed. Immediately belowâ€˜these, the sides of this bone become thinner ; and in each a superficial . cavity or a rough surface is to be seen, where the first ribs are received or joined to the ster- num. In the side of the under end of this first bone, the half of the pit for the second rib on each side is formed. The upper part of the surface behind is covered with a strong ligament, which secures the clavicles: this is afterwards to be more particularly taken no- tice of The second or middle division of this bone, is much longer, narrower, and thinner, than the first j but, excepting that it is a little narrower above than below, it is nearly equal all over in its di- mensions of breadth or thickness. In the sides of it are complete pits for the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth ribs, and an half of the pits for the second and seventh. The lines, which are marks of the former division of this bone, be- ing extended from the middle of the pits of one side to the middle of the corresponding pits of the other side. Near its middle an unossified part of the bone is sometimes found, which, freed of the ligamen- tous membrane or cartilage that fills it, is describ-

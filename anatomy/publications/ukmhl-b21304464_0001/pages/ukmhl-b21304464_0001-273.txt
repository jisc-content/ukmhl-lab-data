245- OF THE RIBS. operation of the empyema, and some others, with more safety than we can do, if we follow the common directions. The first rib of each side is so situated, that the flat sides are above and below, while one edge is placed inwards, and the other outwards, or nearly so ; therefore sufficient space is left above it for the subclavian vessels and muscle ; and the broad concave surface is opposed to the lungs; In conse- quence of this situation, the channel for the inter- costal vessels is not to be found, and the edges are differently formed from all the other, except the second; the lower one being rounded, and the other sharp. The head of this rib is not divided into two plane surfaces by a middle ridge, because it is only ' articulated with the first vertebra of the thorax. Its cartilage is ossified in adults, and is united to the sternum at right angles. Frequently this first rib has a ridge rising near the middle of its posterior edge, where one of the heads of the scalenus muscle rises. Farther for- ward it is flatted, or sometimes depressed by the clavicle. The cartilages of the fifth, sixth, and seventh, or rather the sixth, seventh, eighth, and sometimes the Jifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth ribs *, are con- * Vid. plate 4th appended to my fatherâ€™s Treatise on the Oblique Muscles, which represents the lengths and cm-vatures of the seven uppermost ribs, and their cartilages.

OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 498 brought to a very acute angle with the thigh, by the condyles of the thigh-bones being round and made smooth far backwards. In performing this, the rotula is pulled down by the tibia. When the leg is to be extended, the rotula is drawn upwards, and consequently the tibia forwards, by the exten- sor muscles; which, by means of the protuberant joint, and of this thick bone with its ligament, have in effect the chord, with which they act, fix- ed to the tibia at a considerable angle, therefore act with advantage ; but are restrained from pull- ing the leg farther than to a straight line with the thigh, by the posterior part of the cross ligament, that the body might be supported by a firm per- pendicular column : For at this time the thigh and leg are as little moveable in a rotatory way, or to either side, as if they were one continued bone. But when the joint is a little bended, the rotula is not tightly braced, and the posterior ligament is relaxed; therefore this bone may be moved a lit- tle to either side, or with a small rotation in the superficial cavities of the tibia; which is done by the motion of the external cavity backwards and forwards, the internal serving as a sort of axis*. ^ Seeing then one part of the cross ligament is situ- ated perpendicularly, and the posterior part is stretched obliquely from the internal condyle of * Winslow, Exposition Anatomique du corps humain, Traite des Os secs, ยง 976.

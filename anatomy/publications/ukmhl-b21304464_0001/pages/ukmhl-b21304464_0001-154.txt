126 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. between the same parallels, without attempting to prove, or suggesting, that oblique muscles, placed between the same parallels with straight ones, could, with a smaller decurtation, perform as extensive motion as straight ones; or that, with the same decurtation, they could perform more extensive motions; or that from their obliquity they derived any - other advantage than that of being longer. And he was so far fiom having the most distant conception that oblique muscles could perform more ex- ' tensive motions than straight ones of the same length, that, in the passage above quoted, he affirms tlie direct contrary. “ ideo enim vidclur niusculos illos oblique costis inseruisse^ quanquam iisdem sursunt aid deorsum movendis recta inseflio melius conveniret." What new principle, then, is Dr Mayow supposed to have discovered with regard to the effects of oblique muscles ? • But not to rest here, I shall proceed to shew, by quo- tations from his own works, the inconsistency of Dr Mayow with himself, and to prove undeniably, that he not only did not discover, but did not even suspect that oblique muscles could perform more extensive motions than straight muscles placed between the same parallels. The reader will find the proof of what I here allege, in the subsequent Chapter ii. of Mayow, which I have reprint- ed below at full length, from the Opera Omnia Medico- Physica of J. Mayow in 1681. “ CAP. II. “ Musculorum brevis Descriptio. Item queenam Pars Muscult primario contrahitur.

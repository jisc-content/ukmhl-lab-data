OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 240 which the articulation of the cartilage with it has the appearance of being designed for motion ; but it has none. The substance of the ribs is spongy, cellular, and only covered with a very thin external lamel- lated surface, in which the fibres are more distinct than in most other bones, and which increases in thickness and strength, as it approaches the ver- tebrae. In the richets^ these spongy anterior ends of the ribs swell; hence the sternum appears to be more depressed than it really is. To the fore-end of each rib, a long broad and strong cartilage is fixed, and reaches thence to the sternum, or is joined to the cartilage of the next rib. This course, however, is not in a 'Straight line with the rib ; for generally the car- tilages make a considerable curve, the concave part of which is upwards; therefore, at their in- sertion into the sternum, they make an obtuse angle above, and an acute one below. These cartilages are of such a length, as never to allow the ribs to come to a right angle with the spine ; but keep them situated so obliquely, as to make an angle very considerably obtuse above, till a force exceeding the elasticity of the cartilages is applied. These cartilages, as all others, are firmer and harder internally, than they are on their ex:- ternal surface ; and sometimes, in old people, their middle substance becomes bony, while a thin car- tilaginous lamella appears externally *.

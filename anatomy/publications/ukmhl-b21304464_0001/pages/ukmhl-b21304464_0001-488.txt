460 OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. Epitrochlo-Carpalis, or Flexor Carpi Ulnaris. This muscle takes its origin from the internal condyle of the os humeri, and from the olecranon ulnae ; it passes along the inner side of the ulna, and is inserted into the os pisiforme. This muscle assists the former. Humero-Super-Carpeus, or FjXtensor Carpi Lon- gior. This muscle arises immediately below the su- pinator radii longus, from the ridge above the ex- ternal condyle of the os humeri, it passes along the radius, and its tendon is fixed down by the ligamentum carpi annulare, and is fixed into the upper and back part of the metacarpal bone of the fore-finger, Epicondylo-Super-Metacarpeus, or Extensor Carpi Brevior. The origin of this muscle is similar to that of the former, excepting that a few of its fibres are also connected with the capsular ligament of the joint j its tendon also passes under the annular ligament in the same groove with that of the former mus- cle ; and is inserted into the upper and back part of the metacarpal bone of the middle finger. The two last named muscles extend the wrist.

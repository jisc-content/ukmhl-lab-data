OUTLINES OF ANATOMY. 4^54 Super-Scapulo-Trochitereus Minimus, or Te- res Minor. This muscle arises from the inferior edge of the scapula, between the infra-spinatus and teres major; it ascends along the under edge of the infra-spinatus, and is fixed into the back-part of the larger tuberosity of the os humeri. Scapulo-Humeralis, or Teres Major. This muscle arises from the dorsal side of the inferior angle of the scapula, and is fixed into the ridge, at the inner side of the groove for lodging the long head of the scapulo-radialis, along with the tendon of the latissimus dorsi. The use of this muscle is to roll the os humeri inwards. Sub-Scapulo-Trochineus, or Sub Scapularis. This muscle is concealed by the scapula, fills up the space under it, from the three costae of which it takes its origin. The radiated fibres of this muscle make prints upon the bone. It is fixed into the smaller tuberosity of the os humeri, which it rolls inwards. Sub-Acromio-Humeralis, or Ddtoides. This thick and strong mass of flesh arises from the sternal half of the clavicle, from the acromion.

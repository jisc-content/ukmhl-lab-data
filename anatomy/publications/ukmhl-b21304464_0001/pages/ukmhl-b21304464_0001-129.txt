Strength of Muscles. \ In order to form an estimate of the great strength of the muscles of the living body, it is necessary to examine with attention the manner in which these are inserted into the bones, and near to the joints, for their mechanism may be understood from the properties of the lever. Most of the muscles are so disposed as to act with a mechanical disadvantage, being inserted into the bones near to the joints, and at an acute angle j they are levers of the third kind, situated between the fulcrurn and the resistance. But this loss of strength is fully compensated by the velocity with which they act, and the extent of motion they produce; for it is more useful to us to move a moderate weight with due expedition, and with a considerable sweep, than to possess the power of raising a much greater weight more slowly, and through smaller space. By this contrivance, which is also conducive to the elegance and symmetry of the body, there is a sacrifice of force to attain velocity. Thus, the insertions of the biceps flexor cuhiti, and brachialis internus, are at an average not more than an inch and a half distant from the elbow- joint, the fulcrum on which the fore-arm moves; and therefore a weight placed in the hand, is at a G3

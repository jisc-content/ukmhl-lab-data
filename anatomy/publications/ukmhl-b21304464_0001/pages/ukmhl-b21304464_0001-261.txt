OF THE PELVIS. 2SS happens; Those who had frequently opportunities of dissecting the bodies of women vyho died im- mediately after being delivered of children, teach us to beware of regarding this as the common ef- fect of child-birth ; as they found relaxation in very few of the bodies which they examined *. Considering what great weight is supported in our erect posture, by the articulation of the ossa innominata with the os sacrum, there_ is great reason to think that if the conglutinated surfaces of these bones were once separated, (without which, the ossa pubis cannot shuffle on each other,) the ligaments would be violently^retched, if not torn; from whence many disorders would arise f.

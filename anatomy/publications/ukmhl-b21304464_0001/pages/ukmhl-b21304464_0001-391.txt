OF THE SHAPE OF THE SKULL. 363 cr or less distance, in proportion to the quantity of water effused. The preceding observations appeared to me ne- cessary to the more perfect understanding of the changes which the head undergoes, in shape and size, in .the successive stages of hydrocephalus chronicus. Keeping these in view, and marking the pro- gress of ossification, with the mode of attachment of the different bones of the skull, the phenomena that present themselves appear to admit of a satis- factory explanation. It is obvious, that where the internal pressure is greatly increased, and the bones of the skull give way, that this enlargement must be unequal, owing to the unequal resistance. As the chief circumstances, upon which this unequal resistance depends, in my opinion are the progress of ossification, and the connection of the different bones of the head, I shall now pro- ceed to explain the effect of these more fully. From the imperfect ossification of the bones of the head, when the child is born, it fol- lows that when the disease originates while the foetus was in utej'o, the skull must more readily give way, and more readily acquire a large size, than when the disease occurred at a later period of life, and where the bones of the skull were burst assunder, after having been previously united.

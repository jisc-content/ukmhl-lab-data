PREFACE. Nearly four years have elapsed since the School of Medicine in Birmingham was opened for the admission of Students to the Lectures delivered in the various departments of Medical Science; and during that period, the Lecturers attached to the School have had the satisfaction to find that their labours have been attended with the best success. The several Classes have progressively in- creased, and numerous Students have been enabled by the Instruc- tion received at this Institution, to pass their examination at the Royal College of Surgeons, and at the Apothecaries’ Hall, London, without any attendance at the Medical Schools in the Metropolis.—• Indeed the utility* and efficiency of Provincial Schools of Medicine had been, some years before, fully evinced by those of Manchester. As Anatomy constitutes the basis of Medical Education, it is obvious that, in addition to the Lectures in each branch of the study of Medicine, every Medical School should be provided with a Museum of Natural, Comparative, and Morbid Anatomy, to illus- trate the science of Physiology, Medicine, Surgery, and Obstetrics; and for these purposes, to contain preparations, shewing the struc- ture of the difierent parts of the human body in a state of health, the corresponding structure in other animals, and the deviations from healthy structure as occasioned by disease. By the unwearied exertions of the Lecturer on Anatomy, numerous Anatomical Pre- parations were collected together anterior to the opening of the School, the interests of which were thereby much promoted. It • In confirmation of the utility of Provincial Schools, it is satisfactory to be able to adduce the evidence of an eminent and impartial observer, Aston Key, Esq., Senior Surgeon to Quy’s Hospital, I.ondon, and Lecturer on Surgery in that School; an abstract from whose valuable Paper on Provincial Schools will he found in the Appendix to these remarks.

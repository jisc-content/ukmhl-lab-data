H soon became obvious that, to give full efficiency to the Institution, a public Museum attached to the School would be required; an object which has now been, to a considerable extent, accomplished, by the contribution of the private collections of the Lecturers on Anatomy and Midwifery, by additions of valuable Preparations from the collections of many members of the profession, who have, with great liberality, either presented them, or allowed them to be deposited in the Museum; but above all, by the munificence of various noblemen and gentlemen, whose donations have supplied funds adequate to the fitting-up of the Museum, the purchase of many expensive Preparations in wax, obtained at a great expense from the Continent, and the formation of a Library of reference— of which and the hluseum, short Catalogues are herewith pub- lished. It should be further remarked, in reference to the IMuseum, that illustrations of the other departments of Medical Instruction, and of the sciences subsidiary to Medicine, have not been over- looked ; and accordingly, it has been furnished with a complete set of specimens in Materia Medica, obtained from Apothecaries’ Hall with a small but valuable collection of Minerals, contributed by the Lecturer on Chemistry, and some specimens in the other branches of Natural History; and in the Library w’iU be found nearly all the best and latest works ef Engravings, illustrative of Anatomy, Pathology, and Botany. Thus the School of Medicine in Birmingham is now provided with all the means that were wanted to bring it into full and effi- cient operation. The advantages of a Museum and Library of reference, such as those above described, in a central part of the Island, both to those of the medical profession who are now commencing their studies, and also to those who have completed them, must be apparent to every reflecting mind. It will save the junior part many expences which they would otherwise incur by a lengthened residence in London; and an occasional reference to the IMuseum and Library will serve to revive in the recollection of the established Practitioner some points, in regard to natural and morbid anatomy and other subjects, which, in the multiplicity of professional en- gagements and pursuits, may in part have been obliterated.

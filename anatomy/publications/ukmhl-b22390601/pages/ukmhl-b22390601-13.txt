It were endless to attempt to enumerate or to describe the advantages and influence of previous study on a young man, before he comes to a large scene of disease for the completion of his edu- cation : but there is one, in which is comprised so much that is good, that it deserves to be especially pointed out; I mean the utter ex- tinction of that pernicious system technically termed grinding.”— The demands made on a Student’s time have hitherto rendered this process, to a certain extent, unavoidable. A young man must have a retentive memory, indeed, who can pursue science as it ought to be followed, and at the same time retain in his mind, at the end of two years, those points which an examination calls for. The Stu- dent who conducts his studies, solely intent upon his examinations, will charge his memory with the details of his subjects, to be forgotten as soon as they cease to be subservient to the purposes for which they were acquired.

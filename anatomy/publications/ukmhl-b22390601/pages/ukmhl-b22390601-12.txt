10 Collage of Surgeons, London, and the Apothecaries' Hail, render it no easy task for a Pupil, however diligent he may he, to follow, with any lasting effect, the course of study prescribed, in the short period allotted for their residence in Town. “ To follow with zeal the extensive range of pursuits, as is comprised in the List of the regulations for study now imposed by the College of Surgeons and Apothecaries’ Hall, requires, not only a spirit, but a frame of constitution rarely possessed by a youth of twenty years of age. And it unfortunately happens that a Season rarely elapses without one or more of our most hard-working young men falling a sacrifice to their close application. “ It needs but little argument to convince the Student of the utter impossibility of effectively bestowing his attention to all the important branches of medical education, unless he is able to lighten his labour, by having previously obtained an extensive acquaintance with Anatomy before he commences his studies in Town. Provin^ cial Schools afford him, during his pupilage, the means of gaining this solid foundation. The objections so frequently urged against the long period of apprenticeship, as required by the existing laws, vanish, when the instruction received by occasional attendance on Lectures, during apprenticeship, is taken into consideration. The mind of a Surgeon’s Pupil, who possesses these advantages, becomes early drilled and initiated, not only, as heretofore, in the mechanical art of dispensing medicines, but in the interesting walks of science. He is insensibly led to form a just estimation of the profession in which he is embarked, and to take early delight in those pursuits which are to fonn his principal study. At the termination of his apprenticeship, with a mind well prepared by previous habits of study, and a disposition to take advantage of every opportunity that offers of obtaining information, he comes to a large hospital, where he soon begins to find the value of his previously-acquired knowledge. Instead of being obliged to devote his time to the acquisition of the elementary principles of science, he is able to see and understand their application in practice: instead of exclusively passing his valuable time in the ordinary occupation of a dissecting room—which the Pupil uninformed in Anatomy is compelled to do—he can select liis subjects for dissection, and more accurately inform himself in those parts that are concerned in operations and

XXX111 PREFACE. Considerable light has been thrown upon the minute structure of the liver of the Sheep by the microsco- pical observations made upon that organ by Dr Brewster. I have inserted also the observa- tions of Mr Bryce upon the occasional deficiency of the Gall-bladder of the adult, and upon the Liver of the Foetus, and an account of the numerous experi- ments made upon the Bile by my Father. Notice has also been taken of the Chemical Analysis of the Bile, by Thenard, and by Dr John Dayy. Through the kind offices of my friend Dr Davy, I have been enabled to present to my reader a great number of va- luable and original observations upon the chemical na- ture of Gall-stones, and which I believe, I may add, is the most complete account of the analysis of gall- stones that has hitherto been published. In treating of the organs of Circulation and Respi- ration, I have given an account of the more recent ob- servations upon the blood by Prevost and Blun- dell, and have made particular mention of the re- sult of an experiment of my colleague Dr Duncan junior, which has not yet been before the public, over- turning an opinion of a celebrated author, and prov- ing that no air is extricated during the coagulation of the blood under the atmospheric pressure. I have made mention also of the very important ex- periments of Dr Wilson Philip, upon the laws which regulate the vital functions, and especially of those as to the relation of the Circulating and Ner- vous Systems. The experiments of my Father, concerning the Cir- culation of the Blood, the Influence of the Heart, and of the Arteries, in promoting the circulation of the blood, and on the nature of Inflammation, are also inserted.

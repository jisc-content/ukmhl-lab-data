163 OF THE OSSA UNGUIS. pierced in the operation for the fistula lacrymalts *. This fossa of the bone is cribriform, or has a great number of small holes through it, for the filaments of the membrane which lines it. The ridge between these two cavities of the os un- guis, is the proper boundary of the orbit at its internal can- thus. The internal or posterior surface of this bone consists of a furrow in the middle of two convexities. The substance of the os unguis is as thin as paper, and very brittle; it is easily pierced in living subjects. Diseases of the lacrymal sac very often give rise to caries of the os unguis, and sometimes, also, to that of the neigh- bouring bones. In the Negro skull the fossa for the nasal duct is consider- ably deeper than in the European. Each of these bones is joined above to the frontal bone, by part of the transverse suture; behind, to the os planum of the ethmoid bone, by the same suture; before, and below, to the maxillary bone, by the lacrymal suture. Internally, the ossa unguis cover some of the sinus ethmoidales; nay, are really continuous with the bony lamellse which make up the sides of these cells. The ossa unguis form the interior internal parts of the or- bits, lodge a share of the lacrymal sac and duct, and cover the ethmoid cells. These bones may be injured in performing the operation of the fistula lacrymalis. These bones are fully formed in a new-born child. Ossa Malarum. The Ossa Malarum f, in point of form, are prominent and square. These bones are generally larger in the Scotch than in the English : they are small in the Circassian and Hindoo; but remarkably large in the skulls of the Turk, New Hol- lander, African, Eskimaux, and Norwegian.

ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 250 My Father had ascertained that the capsular ligament is torn in cases of dislocation, and also, that the rent in a li- gament is not readily obliterated : hence a very slight cause may occasion a subsequent dislocation. There was a ce- lebrated actress in this city who often dislocated her shoulder by so slight an effort as raising her arm in the exercise of her profession. The lower end of the os humeri is articulated with the bones of fore-arm, and carries them with it in all its mo- tions, and also serves as a base on which they move. Both the ends of this bone are cartilaginous in a new-born in- fant, and the large head, with the two tubercles, and the trochlea with the two condyles, become epiphyses, before they are united to the body of the bone. Of the Fore-Arm. In the subsequent account of the fore-arm, I under- stand, by the term of posterior, that part which is in the same direction with the back of the hand ; by anterior, that answering to the palm ; by internal, that on the same side with the thumb ; by external, the side nearest to the little finger; supposing the hand always to be in a middle position between pronation and supination. The fore-arm consists of two long bones, the Ulna and Radius, placed obliquely in respect to each other; that is, the ulna is not directly behind, nor on the outside of the radius, but in a middle situation between these two, and the radius â€¢crosses it. The fore-arm is, in proportion to the humerus, longer in the African than in the European. Of the Ulna. The Ulna, so named from its being used as a measure, is the longer of the two bones of the fore-arm, and situated ou the outside of the radius. At the upper end of the ulna, there is a process like a hook, the concave surface of which moves upon the pully of the os humeri, and is called olecranon. The convex back-part of it is rough and scabrous, for the insertion of the triceps exten-

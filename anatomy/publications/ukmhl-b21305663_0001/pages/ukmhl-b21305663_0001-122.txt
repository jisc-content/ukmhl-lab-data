ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 76 spine, when it was bended ; the pain is immediately very vio, lent, and the paralytic symptoms come on in a short time after the luxation: whereas, in the curvature from the un- equal growth of the vertebra?, the curvature encreases very slowly ; till the curvature is great, the pain is not violent, and the palsy don’t appear till the swelling has become large. I have seen three people who have had palsies from the gra^- dual swelling of the vertebra?, but I never saw one luxation of them, though I allow it is not an impossible case. Proba- bly several histories of luxation are recorded, which, on a strict examination, might have been found to be a preterna? tural growth of one side of a bone.” Of Imperfection as to the Formation of the Spine. Before concluding respecting the vertebra?, it may be pro- per to add, that the spinal processes of the cervical, dorsal or lumbar vertebrae, are occasionally awanting at birth, and most frequently those of the latter; and in a very few instances those of the os sacrum. According to Hochstetter, some of the transverse and oblique processes of the vertebrae are also deficient in a few cases ; and according to Maret *, the whole spinal canal has been open. In these circumstances, the membranous sheath of the spi- nal canal is protruded through the aperture in the bones, forming a sac which is filled by a yellowish fluid; but some- times it is reddish, from a slight admixture of blood. The tumour is soft, elastic, of a rounded or oval form, and generally about the size of a billiard ball, and has commonly a broad basis. The tumour gradually becomes larger ; and at length be- comes peculiarly prominent at a certain part, which inflames and ulcerates, and gives way; upon which its contents are dis- charged, and the child dies. When the tumour takes place in the loins, some of the nerves which form the cauda equina are distributed over the inner surface of the sac. * Vide Mem. de Dyon, vol. 2.

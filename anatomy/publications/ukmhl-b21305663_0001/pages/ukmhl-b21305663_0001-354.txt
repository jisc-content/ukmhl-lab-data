ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 308 tebral ligaments are kept in action, whereby they acquire the necessary strength in a few weeks *. These cartilages are very compressible; and hence a tall young man loses sensibly of his height during the day, which he regains when in bed, upon the pressure of the superincum- bent parts being removed. On the same principle, the stoop of old age may be ex- plained. On account of weakness of the muscles of the back, old people bend forwards, by which the fore-parts of the in- tervertebral cartilages, which are much compressed, become, on account of that pressure, much thinner. The cartilages connecting the ribs to the breast-bone may be enumerated among this class of cartilages. These cartilages may be resolved, by long maceration, into layers, of an oval figure, which are. conjoined by a number of cross layers. The cartilages which unite the ribs to the breast-bone, are powerful agents in expiration : being twisted during the ele- vation of the ribs, their elastic re-action tends to pull down the ribs. Of the substance, like Cartilage, in which Bone is formed. This substance, within which bone is formed, is composed of transverse and longitudinal fibres. These cartilages are of essential use: thus the body of the foetus is more readily adapted to the form of the uterus of the mother; thus the sockets of the bones, which are cartilaginous, increase in pro- portion as the heads of the included bones, as in the hip-joint: hence there is less risk of dislocation. In the skeleton of a child, there are also cartilages between the bodies of the bones and their epiphyses, and which gene- rally disappear about the period of puberty *. â€¢ Mr Grant of Bath had the merit of introducing this improved method of treating deformity of the spine, -f- Vide Haase, De Fabrica Cartilaginum ; and Dr W.

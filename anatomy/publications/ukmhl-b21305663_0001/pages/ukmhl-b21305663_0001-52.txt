6 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. chronic; and requires a different, and at times an opposite treatment.” I do not, however, pretend to have fully inves- tigated this subject, or to be able to ascertain all the various shades of inflammation, according to the great diversity of structure observable in the different parts of the body. I only propose to give the Outlines of some of the most obvious and striking distinctions originating from this source; and which, as they occur frequently in practice, are of more im- mediate concern to the practical physician,” The following, then, in my opinion, may be justly consi- dered as distinct Species of Inflammation, each of them having a specific character strongly marked, which, in every instance, seems entirely to depend upon the peculiar structure of the part inflamed. 1. Inflammation of the Skin. Erysipelas, 2. Cellular Membrane. Phlegmon. 3. Diaphanous Membranes. 4. Mucous Membranes. 5. Muscular Fibres. This new arrangement paved the way to a more minute, accurate, and philosophical examination of the structure and properties of the different organs, and has tended much to the advancement of physiological and pathological knowledge, which has now indeed assumed a new aspect. This same ex- cellent idea was taken up, ten years afterwards, by Dr Pixel and Bichat, who have amplified and extended it beyond bounds. Grounding, in my humble opinion, on an ill-founded hypo- thesis, that of an animal and organic life, Bichat has enu- merated no fewer than twenty-one different tissues. Some of the late French writers have added what they have called an Erectile Tissue. A mucous tissue is sometimes formed by disease, as that lining fistula; and I have seen a new mem- brane generated from the serous membranes, as from the dura mater. Without entering farther into the merits of this subject, I shall merely add, that to me there seem to be only the fol-

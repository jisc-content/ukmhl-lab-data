OF THE SKULL. 191 The brain of a child, by particular posture, presses more on the one part of the skull than the other. If the head be unequally balanced on the spine, it will expand in the direc- tion to which it inclines, and one side of the skull will become considerably more capacious than the other. This may arise from an awkward way of standing, from one leg being longer than the other, from wry neck, or any other cause which keeps the head constantly inclined to one side. Dr Camper has published the case of a young woman, which shews clearly the effect of pressure: his patient carried her head to one side, so that the brain was lodged principally upon the orbit of the lower side ; in consequence of which, one eye was lower down in the face than the other, and the' fore- head assumed a particular appearance. The influence of the softer parts upon the form of the harder parts, is also obvious from the remarkable alteration in the form of the jaws after the teeth have fallen out. The roof of the mouth, which in the meridian of life was arched, in advanced life, when the teeth have fallen out, becomes flat; the cavity of the mouth is materially lessened, there is not sufficient space for the tongue, and hence it is protruded out of the mouth- The distance of the chin from the nose becomes shorter by one-sixth part of the length of the head. The pulps of the teeth also determine the form of the teeth ; for the pulps be- fore the process of ossification has commenced have precisely the same form as the tooth, and after the body of the tooth has been formed, the pulps are elongated, forming the basis on which the roots of the teeth are formed. The changes as to the size and form wrhich the skull un- dergoes, during the different stages of Hydrocephalus chroni- cus, also afford evidence of the influence of internal disten- tion upon the form of the skull, and also of the effect of pos- ture and pressure. I have described * two cases, which afford striking exam- ples of the operation of posture and pressure in modifying the " Vide Duncanâ€™s Annals of Medicine for 1803*

94 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. dren cartilaginous; there being only a part of the first bone ossified in a new-born infant. Since, therefore, the intesti- num rectum of children is not so firmly supported as it is in adults, this may be one reason why they are more subject to a procidentia ani than old people *. The ligaments proper to the ossa coccygis admit of these bones being drawn backwards to a considerable extent, which, by enlarging the under aperture of the pelvis, facilitates the expulsion of the contents of the rectum, and also labour; hence, when these ligaments are converted into bone, as often happens in advanced life, labour is rendered difficult. The ossa coccygis being bended forwards, are well calcu- lated for supporting the rectum, whilst the soft parts, which covers these, are not injured in sitting, when the body is in- clined backwards : and it may be added that the encurvature of the os sacrum and ossa coccygis is peculiar to man. Ossa Innominata. The two large broad and irregularly formed bones called Ossa Innominata, constitute the fore part and sides of the pelvis, and the lower part of the sides of the abdomen. Each of these bones of the foetus consists of three bones, to- wit, the os ilium, ischium, and pubis. Os Ilium. * The Os Ilium f, or haunch-bone, is situated highest of the three, and reaches as far down as one-third of the great cavi- ty into which the head of the thigh-bone is received. The external side of this bone is unequally convex, and is called its dorsum;—the internal concave surface is by some (but improperly) named its costa. The semicircular edge at the highest part of this bone, which is tipped with a cartilage in the recent subject, is named the spine, into which the external or descending oblique mus- cle of the abdomen is inserted; and from it the internal as- • f pigel. de Humani corp. fabric, lib. 2. cap. 22.—Paaw de ossib. par. 2. cap. 3. •J* Accyovav, x-inm, scaphium, lumbare, clunium, clavium, auchas.

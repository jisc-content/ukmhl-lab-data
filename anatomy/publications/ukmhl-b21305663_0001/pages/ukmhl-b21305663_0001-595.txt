OF THE INTESTINES. 549 derived from the ramifications of the arteries which are pro- per to the villous coat. The nerves, proper to the intestines, are very minute. Ac- cording to some, the intestines are not under the power of volition; they are only the medium by which other stimuli are conveyed. Of the Mucous Glands of the Intestines. The mucous glands of the intestines are more or less ob- vious, being of different sizes in different animals. They are of a rounded or oval form, and are imbedded within the cel- lular coat of the intestines, and their ducts perforate the in- ternal coat. They are numerous in the smaller intestines, â– especially in that part of the duodenum which is next the sto- mach, and are collected into groups or are solitary, and are also observed at the caput coecum coli, in clusters. There are also a considerable number of mucous glands in the vicinity of the anus. These glands are of a very simple structure : they consist only of a small cavity, upon which small bloodvessels are distributed, and from that cavity there is a small duct, which opens into the cavity of the intestine. These glands are often considerably enlarged by disease, and when in that state, have been very faithfully represented by R(edeeee, in his treatise De Morbo Mucoso. Of the Coats of the Rectum. There are four coats proper to this portion of the larger intestines, a peritonseal coat, a muscular coat, a cellular and a villous coat. The muscular fibres of this portion of intes- tine, which follow a longitudinal direction, are more apparent than in any part of the intestines, and especially those lon- gitudinal fibres which are placed in the front and in the back part of this bowel. The circular fibres near to the anup acquire a considerable degree of thickness and redness, and form, according to some authors, the sphincter ani internus. The mucous coat of the rectum is also thicker, redder, and has more of a velvety surface than in any other part of the

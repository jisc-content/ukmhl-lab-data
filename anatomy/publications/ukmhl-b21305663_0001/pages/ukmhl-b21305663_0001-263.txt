The general character of the tribe consists of a broad round face, with a small arched forehead, sloping and contracting towards the vertex ; the cheek-bone projecting laterally, and rounded. Nose small and depressed ; the mouth large, lips thick, chin large, the teeth well set, close, and beautiful in the young; but, being destitute of mechanical instruments, they are forced by necessity, in most of the operations and arts, to substitute their teeth, which are gradually worn down; and, in the course of a few years, are reduced almost to the level of the gums. The eyes are small, irides black or blackish brown, the aperture of the lids narrow, and slightly inclined to the nose. There is a pe- culiarity existing in the eye-lids, more or less observable in the majority, that I do not recollect noticing among the other tribes of Eskimaux, although it may exist. It consists in a duplication of the adjacent loose skin of the nose and palpe- brae being tightly drawn over the internal angle of the eye, and completely concealing about a fourth part of the natural aperture, producing the appearances of an additional palpe- bra of a crescentic figure. The internal cavity, therefore, instead of being angular, is a very obtuse curve, though in some instances an angle is formed, where the fold crosses the lower palpebrae, and the deformity thereby increased. This singularity seems to depend upon the variable form of the bony orbit at different periods of growth ; for it is more fre- quent, and more strongly marked amongst children, than in those of mature age, and more so in the latter than in ad- vanced age.—Mr Bakrow, in his Travels, likewise notices some such peculiarity in the eyes of the Chinese. “ The hair of the head is straight, coarse, and black, or brownish-black; beard for the most part scanty, but there are remarkable exceptions; no whiskers ; skin is brownish-white in childhood ; many of the youthful of both sexes exhibit a permanent rosy blush on the cheek, which the young women,

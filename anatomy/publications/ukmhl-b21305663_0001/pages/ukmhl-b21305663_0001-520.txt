474 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. is moistened and besmeared by a considerable quantity of a mucous fluid, which is derived from a number of glands, im- bedded in the cellular substance uniting the muscular and villous coats, and which is well calculated for defending the villous coat of the intestines from the acrimony of its con- tents ; and also by a liquor secreted by the small arteries up- on the villous coat, called the Liquor Entericus. CHAP. II. OF THE PARTICULAR ORGANS BY WHICH THE FOOD IS PRE- PARED BEFORE IT PASSES INTO THE STOMACH. In order that the food may undergo the necessary prepa- ratory changes, it is received into the mouth, which, in the more perfect animals, consists, in front, of the lips; above, of of the hard palate; of the soft palate behind ; laterally, of the cheeks; and below, of the tongue. The food of many ani- mals is immediately subjected to the process of mastication; such animals, therefore, are provided with a moveable under jaw, in which teeth are implanted, as well as in the upper jaw. The movements of the jaw, and structure of the teeth, merit peculiar attention, as being an index to the kind of food. If the under jaw be so constructed as to admit only of a ver- tical motion, we may infer, that that animal lives chiefly, or solely, on animal food ; but if, on the other hand, it admits both of the vertical and horizontal movement, the presump- tion is, that the food is of a vegetable nature : and between these extremes, as in the human body, there are intermediate gradations, enabling certain animals to live both on vege- table and animal substances. The form, number, and size, of the teeth correspond exact-

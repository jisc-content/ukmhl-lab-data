ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. H6 The uppermost piece of the sternum is somewhat of the figure of a heart. The upper middle part of this first hone, where it is thickest, is lioliowed, to give place for the trachea; though this ca- vity * is principally formed by the bone being raised on each side of it, partly by the clavicles thrusting it inwards, and partly by the sterno-mastoidei muscles pulling it upwards. On the outside of each tubercle, there is an oblong cavity, that, in viewing it transversely from before backwards, appears a little convex, which receives the ends of the clavicles. Im- mediately below these, the sides of this bone become thinner; and in each a superficial cavity or a rough surface is to be seen, where the first ribs are received or joined to the sternum. On each side of the under end of this first bone, there is the half of the pit for the second rib. The upper part of the surface behind is covered with a strong ligament, which secures the clavicles. The second piece of this bone is much longer, narrower, and thinner than the first; a little narrower above than below, and is nearly equal in its dimensions. There are pits for the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth ribs, and a half of the pits for the second and seventh, on the sides of this bone. An unossified part is sometimes found near to the middle of this bone. When the cartilage between this and the first bone is not ossified, a manifest motion of this upon the first may he obser- ved in respiration, or in raising the sternum, by pulling the ribs upwards, or distending the lungs with air. The third bone is much less than the other two, and has on- ly one-half of the pit for the seventh rib formed in it; where- fore it might be reckoned only an appendix of the sternum. In young subjects it is always cartilaginous, and named, from its shape, cartilago xiphoides, ensiformis, or mucronata, being sometimes like a sword or shield, or bifid: and it is seldom ot * Jugulum, Furculn.

EXTERNAL OBLIQUE MUSCLE OF ABDOMEN. 395 ture, with the addition of the word Under, to distinguish it front the Upper Inguinal or Abdominal Aperture. Through the Under Abdominal Aperture, the spermatic cord passes; and, in the female, the round ligament of the uterus: there is no direct opening into the abdomen, the, passage being shut up by the internal oblique, and transverse muscles, and by the fascia transversalis. The under abdominal aperture in the male is somewhat curved above, angular below, and directed obliquely down- wards and inwards; and the sides of it are thicker than its upper or under part, being formed of the straight fibres of the tendon ; whereas, the thinner tendinous substance, which connects the thicker fibres of the tendon, forms the upper part of the aperture. In the male, the Under Inguinal Aperture is about an inch in length ; but, in the female, it is rather longer, and also narrower. To the upper column of the tendon of the external oblique muscle, which forms the Under Abdominal Aperture, a thin portion of tendon is fixed, which passes downwards, and is at- tached to the gluteus maximus and triceps adductor muscle of the thigh, which has also been observed by Camper, and re- presented by him in one of his excellent plates of hernia: this, by embracing the spermatic cord, proves, in some measure, a barrier against hernia. The upper part of the tendon of the external oblique muscle passes obliquely downwards and inwards, and is, in part, fixed to the ligament of the symphysis pubis of the same side, and also to that part of the ligament of the opposite side, decus- sating, in its course, the tendinous fibres of the external oblique of the opposite side; so that some of the tendinous fibres of the right side terminate in the left os pubis. The portion of the tendinous aponeurosis forming the un- der part of the Under Abdominal Aperture, is folded un- der the spermatic cord, and round ligament of the female; passes inwards, and is inserted into the spinous process of the os pubis, and linea ilio-pectinea (a term used by my grand- father in his Osteology), for the space of about an inch, or a little more. Some have described this insertion of the under

600 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. The larger lobes of the pancreas are composed of smaller lobules, from each of which there is a small duct; and these smaller ducts unite and form the larger pancreatic duct, which begins from the left extremity of the pancreas; and from the addition of the smaller lateral branches it becomes gradually larger; and at the right extremity of the pancreas the duct of the smaller pancreas joins the larger pancreatic duct. The duct of the pancreas has thin coats, and is very readily torn. The larger duct runs from the one end of the gland to the other, becoming gradually larger towards the light end. It is of a white colour, and its coats are then by no means so thick and dense as those of the parotid gland. The larger duct generally enters the duodenum along with, or near to, the ductus communis choledochus, at the lower and posterior part of the second curvature of that bowel; but in some cases the duct opens separately into the duodenum. De Graaf, a great many years ago, by fixing a tube into the duct of this gland in dogs, discovered that the liquor se- creted by it was in all respects similar to spittle. The pancreas receives many small ramifications of the me- senteric and splenic arteries. The veins join with the superior mesenteric veins, and assist in forming the vena portae. The nerves of the pancreas creep along the arteries, and are derived from the caeliac plexus. The absorbent vessels of the pancreas unite with the plexus of the absorbents from the spleen, and terminate in the tho- racic duct. SECTION VI. OF THE OMENTA. The Omenta are composed of follicles, containing fat, con- nected to each other by cellular substance, and covered by the peritonaeum. The smaller is placed between the liver, and smaller curvature of the stomach; and the larger depends from the spleen, the stomach, and colon, and in part covers the smaller intestines.

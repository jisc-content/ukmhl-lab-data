elements of anatomy. 1G 1 lie bones of the Inferior Extremities have been sub- divided into three classes; into the bones of the Thighs, Legs, and Feet. Of the Thighs, 2 Ossa Femorutn. Of the Legs ; 2 Tibiae; 2 Fibulae; 2 Patellae. The bones of the Feet have been subdivided into the bones of the Tarsi, Metatarsi, and Toes. The bones of the Tarsi are, 2 Astragali; 2 Ossa Calcis; 2 Ossa Navicularia ; 2 Ossa Cuboidea; 2 Cuneiformia ex- terna ; 3 Cuneiformia media; 2 Cuneiformia interna. Of the Metatarsi, 10 Ossa Metatarsi. Of the Feet, 10 Posterior Phalanges; 8 Middle Pha- langes ; 10 Anterior Phalanges. The number of the Sesamoid Bones of the Feet varies from 4 to 8. Purposes to which the Skeleton is subservient. lsÂ£, The skeleton is the foundation on which the whole fa- bric is built. It is the basis to which all the other parts are directly or indirectly connected, and to these it gives shape, stability, and support. 2d, The skeleton determines the size, figure, position, pro- portion, and motions of the several members of the body, and regulates its attitudes. The bones give origin and attachment to muscles, tendons, ligaments; and, in general, the eminences and depressions of the bones correspond with the strength of the muscles, and hence are much more evident in the male than in the female or infant, and in strong than in feeble animals. These eminences remove the insertions of the muscles to a greater distance from the centre or axis of the bone, and con- sequently increase the force of the muscles; and those emi- nences in the vicinity of the joints, by adding to the length of the ligament, facilitate the movements of the joints.

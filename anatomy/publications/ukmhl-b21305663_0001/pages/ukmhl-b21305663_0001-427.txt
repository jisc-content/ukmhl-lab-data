OF THE MUSCLES OF THE FACE. 381 Temporis, Sphenoides, Mala?, by radiated fleshy fibres, which, as they descend, become gradually thicker, and which pass under the zygoma, filling up the space between it and the temporal bone; and also from the inner surface of the zygoma. This muscle is fixed into the coronoid process of the under jaw, by the medium of a tendon which envelops the coronoid process. The muscle is covered by a thick tendinous aponeurosis, which is connected with the temporal ridge, the superior edge of the zygoma, and outer edge of the orbit. The above muscle elevates the under jaw ; but it may act with its anterior or posterior fibres in drawing the under jaw backwards or forwards. Zygomato-Maxillaris^ or Masseier. To expose fully to view this muscle, it is necsssary to re- move the platysma myoides, the parotid gland, the nerves of the face, and the transverse artery of the face, and a portion of the orbicularis palpebrarum muscle. This muscle forms a distinct prominence between the fore- part of the ear and angle of the lower law. It is a thick, strong muscle, of an oblong square shape, which covers and deeply imprints the side of the under jaw-bone. It takes its origin from the superior Maxilla, and from the Zygoma, by tendinous fibres; and is fixed into the side and angle of the under jaw. The fibres of the different parts of this muscle cross each other; the outer part slants backwards, and the inner part forwards, so that the fibres in a degree decussate one another. This very strong muscle concurs with the former in ele- vating the under jaw. The outer part of it also assists in pulling the jaw forwards, and the remainder of the muscle pulls the jaw backwards. The lateral movements of the under jaw are performed by the Pterygoidei muscles. The Pterygo-Maxillaris Minor, Superior, or Pterygoideus Extcrnus, Takes its rise from the outer side of the Pterygoid Plate

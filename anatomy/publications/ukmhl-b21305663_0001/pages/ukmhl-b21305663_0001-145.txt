c 2 OF THE OS PUBIS. 90 jeo- or process above it, becomes an epiphyse before this bone is fully formed. Os Pubis. The Os Pubis, *, or share-bone, is the least of the three parts of the os innominatmn, and is placed at the upper fore part of it. The thick largest part of this bone forms a part of the aceta- bulum ; from which becoming much smaller, it is stretched inwards to its fellow of tlie other side, where again it grows larger, and sends a small branch downwards to join the end of the small leg of the os ischium. The upper fore part of each os pubis is tuberous and rough, and gives insertion to the musculus rectus and pyramidahs. From this a ridge is extended along the upper edge of the true pelvis, in a continued line with such another of the os il- ium, which divides the abdomen and pelvis. This ridge is call- ed Linea Ileo-Pectinea. The ligament of Fallopius, or crural arch, is fixed to the internal end of this ridge, and the smooth hollow below it, is made by the psoas and iliacus internal muscles passing with the anterior crural vessels and nerves behind the ligament. Some way below the former ridge, another is extended from the tuberous part of the os pubis downwards and outwards to- wards the acetabulum : between these two ridges the bone is hollow and smooth, for lodging the head of the pectineus muscle. Immediately below, where the lower ridge is to take the turn downwards, a winding niche is made, which is compre- hended in the great foramen of a skeleton, but is formed into a hole by a subtended ligament in the recent subject, for the passage of the posterior crural nerve, an artery, and a vein. The edges of the descending portions of the ossa pubis are, more especially in the male, prominent, and folded back- wards. In the Negro this prominence is very conspicuous, and, together with the very prominent tuber ischii, forms a very distinguishing feature of the pelvis in that race. pectinis, penis, pudibundum, fenestratum.

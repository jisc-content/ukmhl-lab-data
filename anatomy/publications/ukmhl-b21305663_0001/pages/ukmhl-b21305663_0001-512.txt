There is a large bursa mucosa common to the tendons of the peronei muscles. A bursa is proper to the tendon of the peroneus brevis. A bursa mucosa is placed between the tendo Achillis and the os calcis; and there is a pelleton of fat, which projects in- to the cavity of the bursa. A bursa mucosa intervenes between the flexor pollicis lon- gus and the os calcis. There is a bursa between the flexor digitorum longus com- munis, and the tibia and os calcis. A bursa is placed between the tendon of the tibialis posti- cus, and the tibia and astragalus. Bursa Mucosa in the Sole of the Foot.

There axe five bursa mucosa of the flexor tendons, which begin a little above the first joint of the toes, and extend to the root of the third phalanx or insertions of the tendons into the bones.

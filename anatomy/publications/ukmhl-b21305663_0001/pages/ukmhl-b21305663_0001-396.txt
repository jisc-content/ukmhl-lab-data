ELEMENT* OF ANATOMY. 350 ly, as to prevent even a very fine liquor from passing from the larger into the smaller ramifications. But in the skate*, there are no valves in the small lympha- tic vessels; and hence, by a successful injection, the smaller branches of the lymphatic vessels may be filled ; and these vessels, when filled by a liquor coloured with vermilion, are so abundant as to give a red tinge to the part. Nerves of Muscles. The bloodvessels of the muscles are accompanied by nerves, which divide into so many and so small branches, as to elude the knife of the anatomist. For it is probable, that each muscular fibre lias its correspondent nervous filament. The nerves of the muscles are not proportioned to their size; those of the muscles of voluntary motion being large and numerous, whereas those of, the involuntary muscles are very small. The nerves of the heart are small, which led Behrends-|- to deny their existence, though he admits that nerves are distributed upon the coats of the coronary arteries, which, for the anatomist, was a fortunate circumstance, as it gave rise to the publication of Scarpa’s very beautiful and correct representations of the nerves of the neck and thorax. Many muscles receive nerves frcm various sources, and an- tagonist muscles, in many instances, from the same sources t. Wounds, laceration, inflammation, and other diseases, prove the great sensibility of these organs. There are many sub- stances which have the effect of hardening the muscular fibre, as alkohol, diluted acids, alum, common salt, and saltpetre; the two last render the muscular flesh redder. The muscles have been called by some authors the moving extremities of the nerves, upon which opinion my Father has published the following comment: * Vide Monro on Fishes. Vide Ludwig. Scriptor.

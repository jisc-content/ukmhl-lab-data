502 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. point, middle, and apex of the tongue, and are intimately mixed with those of the lingualis and hyoglossus muscles. The muscle is also attached to the body of the os hyoides. I his muscle raises or depresses the tongue, moves it from one side to another, and draws the tongue forwards, so as to push it out of the mouth ; or pushes it backwards, or pulls it downwards. This muscle also pulls the os hyoides towards the chin. Stylo-Glossus. This muscle takes its rise from the styloid process of the temporal bone, and is fixed into the side of the tongue, near to its point. This muscle draws the tongue to one side, and backwards. Besides the above muscles, there are a number of short fibres distributed through the substance of the tongue, which have been named and represented by Malpighi and Du Verney under the names of fibrse longitudinales, transversae, perpendiculares. These fibres may serve as auxiliaries to the preceding mus- cles, or they may act separately ; and their action is limited to the particular part of the tongue where they are situated. The tongue is very largely supplied with blood by the branches of the arteria ranina; hence the greater safety of removing a portion of the tongue by the application of liga- ture than by the knife, it being difficult to stop the flow of blood. The tongue receives nerves from three different sources. The branches of the fifth pair are distributed upon the point of the tongue; those of the ninth pair of nerves upon the sides of the tongue; and those of the eighth supply the basis. According to Blumenbach, the muscles of the tongue are more irritable than those of the heart, and â€œ appeared to all the bystanders to survive the heart by more than seven mi- nutes, and to retain the oscillations of its fibres altogether for a quarter of an hour ; and so vivid were the movements, when I cut across the fore-part of the tongue, that the butchers

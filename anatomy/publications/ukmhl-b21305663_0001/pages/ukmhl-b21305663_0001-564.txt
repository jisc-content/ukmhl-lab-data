518 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. The situation, dimensions, and relative position of the sto- mach, vary even when that organ is sound, according to its state of distention; and hence the necessity of describing it both when empty and when full. The undistended stomach may be said to present an ante- rior and posterior surface, and to have two orifices, the car- diac or left, and 'pyloric or right; by the former of which, it is connected with the gullet, nearly opposite to the ninth ver- tebra of the back, and by the latter with the intestines. These orifices, when the stomach is empty, are not on the same le- vel, the cardiac being the more elevated. The stomach is al- so described as having two curvatures; the upper, or smaller, being the sweep which the upper portion of the stomach de- scribes between the gullet and duodenum; and the under, or larger, being the more extensive, or, in the undistended state, the lower line of stomach, to which the greater omentum is fixed, the bond of union between the stomach and transverse arch of the colon. The two opposite sides of the stomach are in contact with each other, when this organ is undistended. The coats of the stomach, in all men or in all animals, are not of an uniform thickness, nor are they equally thick in every part of the same stomach : they are thickest in robust men, and still more so in the tyger, lynx, and other carnivo- rous animals; and they are thinnest at the great left sac, and become gradually thicker towards the pylorus. *' As the food passes into the stomach, its coats yield to the mechanical distension, and seem at first to bo passive; but af- ter a certain time, they contract upon their contents, and adapt themselves to these. As the stomach is filled, the greater curvature is gradually protruded forwards and upwards, forming a considerable angle with the gullet; and at length it presses on the parietes of the abdomen, so as to occasion a considerable swelling, in which the pulsations of the gastro-epiploic artery, which passes along the greater curvature, may, in emaciated people, be readily perceived. If vomiting shall take place, when the stomach is very much distended, that organ may be burst, as the angle the

533 or THE CAST11IC JUICE. tables only ; whilst in the carnivorous and fish, its operation seems confined entirely to animal matter; whereas in man, and animals destined like him to live both on vegetable and animal matters, its solvent power seems equally effectual on either; for it is adapted to the digestion and assimilation of certain vegetables, as well as animal matters. It seems, that, as yet, we are much in the dark as to the nature of the gastric juice, which probably differs very much, not only in animals of different classes, but in animals of the same class, some eating that kind of food with impunity, which proves a poison to others; a fact which I have already taken notice of in my Thesis, “ Quasdam tamen res quibus- dam animalibus lethales, aliis animantibus minime nocere. no- tandum est; sic, capri cicuta, vaccis perniciosissima, impune vescuntur; porci hyoscyamo pinguescunt; equus vitri anti- monii quantitatem quae centum homines necaret, impune to- lerare potest; canis opii copiam homini huic non assueto le- thalem, sine periculo devorare potest: Contra autem, dosis ja- lapae aut nucis vomicae, aut amygdalae paucae amarae, eundem convellerent aut extinguerent.” It may be added to this chapter, that there are many ex- traordinary examples of animal life being preserved for a long time without food. One of the most remarkable of these, is mentioned in the forty-first number, and 396th page, of Di- Thom sox’s Annals cf Philosophy. A hog was buried in his stye, by the fall of a part of the chalk-cliff* under Dover Castle, and 160 days after the accident, the animal was dug- out in a very emaciated state, and had lost about 120 lb. of its weight. SECTION V. ’hn,. OF THE INTESTINAL CANAL. The length and capacity of the intestines bear a ratio to the kind of food. In animals purely carnivorous, they are not only much shorter, but also less capacious than in graminivo- rous animals ; and those of omnivorous animals, as man, hold

ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 106 rllie subject of this malconformation informed me, that when in female society the penis was frequently erected. I have seen two children with similar malconformations. CHAP. VIII. OF THE THORAX. The thorax, or chest, reaches from below the neck to the belly; and, by means of the bones that guard it, is formed into a large cavity : the figure of which is somewhat conchoi- dal, with its upper smaller end left open for the passage of the windpipe, gullet, and large bloodvessels: its lower part, or base, has no bones, and is shorter before than behind so that it is like to an oblique section of the conchoid. The lower part of this cavity is narrower than some way above *; and the middle of its back part is considerably diminished by the projection of the spine. The figure of the thorax is very various, corresponding with that of the included parts. Hence it may be partially or generally deformed by diseases of the heart, and great ves- sels connected with it, or by those of the lungs, liver or spleen ; by the unnatural accumulation of fluids within the pleurm, or belly ; or by pressure applied externally, which, by forcing the ribs inward, and, by interrupting the functions cf the contained viscera, often lays the foundation of bad health. In the rickety skeleton, the ribs are much flattened. I have seen them concave, instead of being convex, outwardly. The female chest is shorter and broader than that of the male. โข Albin. dc Ossib. ยง 169.

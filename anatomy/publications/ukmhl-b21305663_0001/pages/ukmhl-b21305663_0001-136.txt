ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 90 unties, are deformed to as great a degree as any of the female pelves. OF THE PARTICULAR BONES OF THE PELVIS. Of the Os Sacrum. The transverse processes on each side of this bone are united into one large mass, which is thick, and divided into two irregular cavities, by a long perpendicular ridge. The foremost of the two cavities has commonly a thin carti- laginous shin covering it in the recent subject, and is a- dapted to the unequal protuberance of the os ilium, and a strong ligament connects the circumference of these surfaces of the two bones. The cavity behind is divided by a transverse ridge into two, where strong ligaments that go from this bone to the os ilium, with a cellular substance, containing mucus, are lodged. The transverse processes of the two last bones of the os sa- crum are much smaller than those of the former. At their back part near the edge, a knob and oblong flat surface give rise to two strong ligaments which are extended to the os ischium; and are therefore called sacrosciatic. The spinal processes of the three uppermost bones of the os sacrum are short, sharp, and almost erect, but the two lower are open behind; and sometimes a little knob is to be seen on the fourth, though generally it is bifurcated, with- out the two legs meeting into a spine; in which condition also the first is often to be seen; and sometimes a fossa, instead of a canal, is left *. These spinous processes give rise to the la- tissimus and longissimus dorsi, sacro-lumbalis, and glutceus maximus, muscles. Canal.—The canal between the bodies and processes of this bone, for the cauda equina, is triangular; and becomes smal- ler as it descends, as the cauda also does. Below the third bone, this passage is no more a complete bony canal, but is open behind; and is there defended only by a strong liga- * Vekjieyen, Anat. trac. 5. cap. 9.—Sue Trad, d’ostcol, p. 137.

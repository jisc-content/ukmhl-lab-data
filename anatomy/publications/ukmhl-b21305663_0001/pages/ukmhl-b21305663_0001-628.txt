582 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. breathe very laboriously; and the weakness increasing, it died after four hours. Founding on what has been above stated, my Father pro- posed, in the case of wounded gall-bladder, that, instead of endeavouring to sew up the wound in the gall-bladder, the wound of the abdomen should be dilated, and a ligature should be thrown around the top of the cystic duct, or neck of the gall-bladder, which he practised, without much diffi- culty, several times on dogs and pigs, and without killing the animals. At the same period, my Father also made a num- ber of experiments upon animals, with the view of determin- ing^whether jaundice proceeded from an absorption of bile. These experiments led him to conclude, that the valvular lym- phatic vessels convey the bile to the blood. He has stated in one of his manuscripts, â€œ I opened the cavity of the abdomen of a number of living animals, and threw a ligature around the ductus communis choledochus, and then sewed up and healed the wound. Jaundice was in consequence produced. I kept these animals alive for a few hours only, or for a number of days, and several of them for some weeks, the depth of the yellow colour daily increasing. Fopened their abdomen a second time atjdiffe^ent intervals, af- ter having tied up the biliary ducts, and found in all of them, that the lymphatic vessels contained a yellowJluid different from, that which was conveyed by the lymphatic vessels from other organs, or from the liver in the usual state ; and, on cutting transversely the lymphatic vessels (f the liver, and receiving their contents into a spoon, the lymph had not only a yellow colour, but a bitter taste, resembling that of bile. I particularly attended to the colour and taste of the lymph in those animals in which the ligature had been around the gall ducts for a few hours only, lest it should have been supposed that the blood had been tinged by the bile, by the medium of the venae cavae hepaticae, and that this tinge had been communicated to the lymph of the body in geneial, and afterwards secreted into the cellular membrane universally, and of course into that of the liver, and then only taken up by the lymphatic vessels.*'

63 OF DEFORMITY OF THE SP1NI into frequent action the muscles of the spine; but when the bones of the spine have become very soft machinery is useful, if constructed by a skilful artist, but if ill made, by removing the weight from the spine, and throwing it upon the bones of the pelvis, by resting upon the spines of the ossa innominata, these are bent forwards, and the ossa ilii and pubis, which form the front of the pelvis, are bent inwards, whereby the ca- pacity of the upper aperture of the pelvis is so much abridged as to be incapable of receiving or of giving passage to the child’s head. In illustration of the mode of treating deformed spine, I have subjoined, from an unpublished manuscript of my Grand- father, his remarks on this head. Speaking of the influence of posture, he observes: “ To illustrate this, I shall relate several cures made by such directions. A boy who had been made weak with a tedious fever, was placed every day for some weeks in an armed chair at the side of the fire, and with his back to the light.

In two weeks more the spine had got a curvature to the other side, for which I was again consulted, and advised the chair to he put again to its first place, but recommended to the mother to examine the state of the spine every morning, and as soon as she saw it was straight to change the chair every two or three hours from one side of the fire to the other, which was done till the boy was strong enough for rambling about, by which time he was perfectly straight in his back, and has continued so ever since. A girl who had been employed some time in sewing at a tent was observed to have her spine crooked : I was consulted, and advised that she should continue to sew some time longer at 2

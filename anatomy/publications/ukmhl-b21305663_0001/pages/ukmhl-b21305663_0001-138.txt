92 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. os coccygis admits of considerable motion. Laterally, the os sacrum is joined to the ossa ilia by an immoveable syn- chondrosis : the cartilaginous crust on the surface of the bones is very thin, and both their surfaces are scabrous and unequal, and indented into each other; and the connex- ion between the bones is so intimate, that great force is required to separate them, after all the muscles and ligaments are cut. Frequently the two bones grow together in old subjects. State at Birth.—The bones composing the os sacrum of infants, are separated from each other by a thick cartilage; and, like the true vertebrae, each of them consists of a body and two lateral plates, connected together by cartilages; the ends of the plates seldom being contiguous behind. In consequence of the imperfect ossification of the os sa- crum, there is sometimes an aperture in it through which the rectum protrudes. M. Lacoste has described to the Royal Medical Society of Toulouse, a case of what he has cal- led a Sacro-rectal Hernia. There was a tumour in the mid- dle and posterior part of the os sacrum of the size of a wal- nut, an inch and a half above the anus, which received an impulse when the child cried, and which could be reduced ; upon which being done, the faeces were discharged with force from the anus. Os Coccygis *. Os Coccygis, or rump-bone, is that triangular chain of bones appended to the os sacrum. The os coccygis is convex behind, and concave before; which crooked pyramidal figure renders it somewhat similar in form to a cuckow’s beak. This bone consists, in middle life, of four pieces, which are of unequal size; and the largest is fixed to the smaller end of the os sacrum. In children, very near the whole of it is car- tilage : In old subjects, all the bones are united, and become frequently one continued bone with the os sacrum.

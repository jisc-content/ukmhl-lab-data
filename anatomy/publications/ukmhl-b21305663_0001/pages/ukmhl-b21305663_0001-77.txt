31 OF TIIE PERIOSTEUM. aredients, as Mr Hatchett has well observed in the following _ sentence: “ Bone, shell, coral and the zoophytes, only differ in composition, by the nature and quantity of the hardening or ossifying principle, and by the state of the substance with which itis mixed or connected : for the gluten or jelly which cements the particles of the carbonate or phosphate of lime, and die membrane, cartilage, or horny substance, which serves as a basis, in and upon which the ossifying matter is secreted and deposited, seem to be only modifications of the same sub- stance, which progressively graduates from a viscid liquid or gluten, into that gelatinous substance which, by increased inspissation, and by the various and more or less peifect de- grees of organic arrangement, forms the varieties of mem- brane, cartilage and horn.'” Of the Periosteum.—All the bones, excepting the bodies of the teeth, are covered by a compact, tough, whitish co- loured serous membrane called Periosteum, and which is of different thickness in different places. This membrane is externally rough, and covered by a quan- tity of cellular substance, by which it is fixed to the neigh- bouring parts, but internally smooth; and it is fixed firmly to the surfaces of the bones by short cellular threads, and by a great many small bloodvessels, which, on tearing this mem- brane from the bone, discharge blood. A membrane, similar to this, covers the cartilages, which has been called Perichondrium. The periosteum may be di- vided into two layers. The fibres of the outer layer vary in their size, number and direction, in different bones, and even in the same bone in different places. The internal layer is similarly constructed as the external, but the fibres composing it are smaller, and have rather more of a glistening appearance, and follow the same course as those of the bone to which they are fixed. Arteries derived from the neighbouring arteries, are distri- buted into very small branches upon this membrane, before entering into the substance of the bones; and arc larger and more numerous than those of tendons or ligaments; and

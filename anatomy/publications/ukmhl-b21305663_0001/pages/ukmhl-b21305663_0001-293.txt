DISLOCATION OF THE IIUMEUUS. 247 the biceps flexor cubiti, and supra-spinatus muscles, and re- ceives great support from the acromion and coracoid processes of the scapula, and ligament, stretched between these pro- cesses internally, by the tendon of the subscapularis muscle, and externally, by that of the teres minor and infra spinatus muscles; hence the head of the os humeri may be more rea- dily dislocated downwards and inwards, as the capsular liga- ment of the shoulder-joint is supported and strengthened in every other direction. About seventy years ago, different opinions were entertain- ed as to the state of the ligaments, when a joint had been dis- located. The greater number of writers joined Heister in opinion, that the capsular ligament is merely extended, when a joint has been dislocated. With regard to the opinion of Heister, it may be observed, that a subluxation at the shoulder-joint has sometimes occur- red in children of a very debilitated frame of body, from so slight an effort as the suddenly raising the arm; and the bone after a time regains its place without surgical aid, and with a crack. Mr Bryce informs me, that he knew a girl who had re- peatedly dislocated the knee-joint in running; and so great was the degree of relaxation, that the patient used to sit down upon the spot, and replace the bones. But in more advanced life, when the humerus has been dislocated, the capsular ligament is torn to such a degree, as readily admits of the replacement of the bone. My Fatherâ€™s attention was directed to this disputed ques- tion, whilst he was prosecuting his studies in this city. He conceived, that, as the ligaments possess little or no share of elasticity, these must be ruptured, as they could not be stretched to such a degree as to admit of the displacement of the articular surfaces of the bone: he put his opinion to the test of experiment, and found, that after steeping the ligaments for some hours in tepid water, he could not produce a perfect dislocation, unless the ligaments were la- cerated.

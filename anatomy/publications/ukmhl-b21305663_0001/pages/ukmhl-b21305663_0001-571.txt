OF CHYMIFTCATION. 525 There is only one way of arriving at a precise knowledge of the appearances of the contents of the stomach ; for I hold all observations deduced from examining the contents of the stomach after vomiting, or from those cases in which there has been an aperture in the coats of the stomach and parie- ties of the abdomen, as calculated to lead to error. That is, to examine the contents when taken a few hours after death from the stomach of a person who, in the prime of youth and health, has suffered a violent death, about two hours af- ter having taken food ; or, to feed an animal a few hours be- fore killing it. It is also difficult to ascertain the length of time which the food is detained within the stomach. It has been supposed, that as vomiting takes place in the case of obstructed or scirrhous pylorus, in the course of two or three hours after eating, that, the food is detained within the stomach for that space of time ; but there must be many exceptions to this observation. Repeated observation and experiment have proved, that the contents of the stomach do not pass into the intestine, in the order they have entered it; but only after having under- gone the necessary change within the stomach. The rapidity with which different kinds of food is convert- ed into chyme, is very various in different individuals, and even in the same individual, at different times. The contents of the stomach are found, more or less, dis- solved in the opposite extremities of that organ, which, ac- cording to some authors, during chymification, is divided at, or near to its middle, into two pouches, a cardiac and â– pyloric; and, in the latter, the contents are found to be in the state of the more perfect solution ; and that part which is most super- ficial is the softest. In the living animal, the contents of the stomach may be observed passing from left to right, or towards the pylorus; and they are turned over and over, so that the central part becomes the more superficial. If it be legitimate to draw a general conclusion from an in- dividual example, it appears from a case, that fell under the

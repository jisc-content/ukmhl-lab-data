FASCIA LATA OF THE THIGH. 40l of some standing, the upper aperture is nearly opposed to the under aperture. There are some fibres from the under column of the ex- ternal oblique muscle, which strengthen the back part of the inguinal canal. The diaphragm and levator ani should perhaps be descri- bed in this place, as they have a great effect upon the bowels of the abdomen. But as the diaphragm cannot be seen until the viscera of the abdomen are removed, I shall describe it under the head of the muscles of respiration. The levator ani I propose to describe under the head of muscles proper to the anus. As the fascia lata of the thigh is intimately interwoven with the fasciae of the muscles of the abdomen, and as the relation and connection of these fasciae is necessary to the explanation of the nature of hernia, I have subjoined a description of the fascia lata of the thigh. Of the Fascia Lata of the Thigh. The muscles of the thigh are covered by a strong tendin- ous aponeurosis, called Fascia lata, which takes its rise from the outer rounded portion of the crural arch, from the spine of the ilium, and from the pubes. Beneath the crural arch, (supposing the body to be erect), an oval-shaped depression may be perceived on the fore, and rather on the inner part of the thigh, on the surface of the pectineus muscle, which is bounded by a well defined tendin- ous border, except at its inner edge. The situation of the above-mentioned depression merits notice, as marking the situation of crural hernia. In the fascia lata, there is an aperture through which the vena saphena major passes, to join the femoral vein, the borders of which aperture are covered by fat, cellular substance, and lymphatic glands. The fascia lata has been described as being com- posed of two distinct portions: one of which covers the upper and outer part of the thigh, and is connected with the larger VOL. i. c c

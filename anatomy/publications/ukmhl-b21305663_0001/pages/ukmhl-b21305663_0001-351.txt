OF CARTILAGE. 305 flexor tendon and the frog;â€”thus the animal is placed, as it were, upon a series of springs. Those cartilages which cover the extremities of the bones, and form the articulating surfaces, have been named articu- lating or abducent cartilages. They are remarkably smooth on the surface, lubricated by synovia, and of unequal thick- ness, beino- thickest towards the centre. The fibres of this kind of cartilage are remarkably small, and can be seen only after maceration in water for six or eight weeks; they may then be observed to be united at right angles in respect to the bone to which they are connected. Of the Inter articular Cartilages. The term interarticular cartilage is descriptive of the situa- tion of these cartilages, some of which are moveable, but others are immoveable. The interarticular cartilages are harder than the former, and are thinner in the centre than towards their circumference. The interarticular cartilages tend to in- crease the surfaces of application of the articulating surfaces: they form a variable socket, the lines of which assume a dif- ferent curvature in different inclinations of the bones; they adapt the surfaces of articulation to each other more ac- curately, in different positions of the joint, thereby adding to the security of the joint, and also to the sphere of its ac- tion : of this the articulation of the knee and of the under- jaw affords a wrell-marked example, the interarticular sub- stance of which moves with the condyle of the jaw, when it leaves its socket. Of the Connecting Cartilages. Contiguous bones, as the ossa innominata and os sacrum, the ossa pubis, the sternum, ribs and vertebra;, are united by car- tilages. The intervertebral cartilages are of a very peculiar kind ; being composed of an intermixture of cartilage and liga- ment. They partake of the properties of both. Thus the very vol. i. u

CHAP. XII. â€¢ OF THE DISTINCTIONS IN THE SKULL OF THE MALE AND FEMALE, AND OF THE DISTINC- TIONS OF THE SKULLS OF DIFFERENT NATIONS. SECTION I. Of the distinctions between the Skull of the Male and Female. THERE are several marks of distinction between the skulls of the female and the male. In the female, the skull is lighter, owing to its greater thinness. The cranial part bears a larger proportion to tbe bones of the face, all of which are smaller and not so much impressed by the muscles as those of the male: it is nar- rower in front but broader behind. The alveolar processes are not only smaller but more of an elliptical form. The palatine processes of the superior maxillary bones are more contracted, so that the mouth is smaller. The teeth of the female are smaller and rounder than those of the male. The skull of the female, in proportion to the stature of the individual, is in circumference greater, but it is generally not so much elevated at the vertex as that of the male. The frontal sinuses are not so conspicuous, and when open- ed are found not to be so large in any of their dimensions.

OB BILIARY CALCULI. 591 equally destitute of taste, excepting the central part, which differed from the rest, .and had the peculiar taste and smell of inspissated bile; it was found in every concretion, and, on ac- count of the slight transparency of the adipocire, this black nucleus was seen in many, through the external coat. The greater number of these sank in water, a few did not; and these, when broken, were found to contain small cavities. Their specific gravity was ascertained to be 1050. But, ac- cording to Gren, the specific gravity, of this species, is less than that of water, no more than 0.803. Without doubting the correctness of his experiments, I cannot help suspecting that they were made on entire calculi, or on fragments con- taining air, as, in every instance, I have found this species to sink in water, when proper care was taken to break down the cavities, and separate the adhering air-bubbles. After what has been already said, of the general mode of analysis, I need not give an account of the experiments that were made, to ascertain the proportions of the constituent parts ; it will be sufficient to mention the latter, which, in 100 parts, appear as follows : 80 Adipocire. 13 Bile. 2 Brown Matter. 5 Water. 100 I should have stated, that the bile and brown matter were confined to the centre, and that the envelope, in general, was pure adipocire. It is obvious, that the proportions stated above, are only approximations to the proportions of the whole, and not of individuals, which, in this respect, must greatly vary, as, in some small calculi, large nuclei were found, and vice versa. » No. 6.—This calculus was of a polygonal form, and of a yellowish white colour, and very similar to the last; only dif- fering in being less micaceous, and more compact. Its spe- cific gravity was 1060. 100 parts were found to consist of

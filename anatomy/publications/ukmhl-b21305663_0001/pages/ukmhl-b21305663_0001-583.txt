53 7 OF THE ILIO-COLIC VALVE. the more the lips of the valve are separated from each other; but when the liquid is injected in the contrary direction, or from the larger intestine, the lips of the valve are pressed to- wards each other; and the greater the quantity thrown up, the more the sides of the valve are pressed against each other. The peritoneal coat, extending from the ileum to the caput coecum coli, retains these portions of intestines in their relative positions. Of the Appendix Verm for inis. The Appendix Yermiformis is a conical tube, about five inches long, appended to the caput coecum coli, to the poste- rior and left part of which it is fixed by its mesentery ; and from its small size and tortuous course, it bears some resem- blance to an earth-worm. The coats of this appendix are similar to those of the intes- tines. Upon opening this small tube, we find within it a number of mucous glands, and a small quantity of fat, and of cellular substance, but commonly no feculent matter. The appendix vermiformis is proportionally much larger in the foetus than in the adult; and hence has, by some au- thors, been considered as a reservoir for the faeces during ges- tation. My grandfather has remarked, â€œ I never saw kthe appendix vermiformis of any of the human foetuses whichl have dissected distended with meconeum.11 Hardened faeces sometimes get into this appendix in the adult, and prove a source of great irritation, and even of in- flammation of the intestine. A case of this description lately occurred to Dr Graham, my colleague. The appendix ver- miformis sometimes proves a cause of strangulation and mor- tification of the neighbouring intestine. My colleague Dr Graham, had a patient under his charge, who died with all the symptoms of ileus. Upon dis- section, a considerable portion of the smaller intestine was found sphacelated, and no adequate cause could be assigned for it, excepting a deficiency of the mesentery of the appen-

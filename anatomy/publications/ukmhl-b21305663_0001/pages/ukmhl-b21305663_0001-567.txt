521 OF THE HUMAN STOMACH. Of the Coats of the Stomach. The stomach has four coats, the peritonaal, muscular, cel- lular, and villous. The peritonaea! and muscular coats are not easily separated from each other; but the muscular and villous coats may be readily disjoined, as the cellular coat is of considerable thick- ness, and admits of considerable extension. The peritonaeal coat has the same general characters as all the other portions of that serous membrane; and the muscu- lar fibres are seen distinctly through it, passing in different directions. The second coat is made up of distinct muscular fibres, â– which may be divided into two strata, and which ax*e very ap- parent in the stomach of a robust man; but, in persons of a debilitated constitution, they are much smaller, paler, and more flaccid, and not unlike to membrane. The external stratum of muscular fibres is continued from the gullet, and is disposed, in a longitudinal manner, between the cardia and pylorus, and they become gradually thicker as they approach the pylorus. The internal stratum of muscular fibres is disposed, in an oblique or circular manner, and many of the fibres decussate each other. By means of the muscular fibres proper to the coats of the stomach, the different parts of the food are turned over and over, and more intimately incorporated with each other, to which the pressure of the diaphragm and abdominal muscles probably contributes in a considerable degree. The third coat of the stomach consists of loose cellular sub- stance ; this concurs with the fourth or villous coat in form- ing the folds of the stomach, which, when the stomach is empty, are very conspicuous. The greater number of these folds, which are of different sizes, are disposed in the transverse direction ; and, between these, there are a number of smaller folds. The larger folds disappear when the stomach has been considerably distended. Even in very fat persons, there is no fat deposited in this coat.

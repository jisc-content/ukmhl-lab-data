ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 454 on the same step. In another case, the cure was not so com- plete, as the patient could not be prevailed upon to remain in bed, and to follow the directions given to him. A third pa- tient, a man of 50 years of age, had been dissuaded from ex- tending and bandaging his knee; and, when my Father saw him, five weeks after the tendon had been torn, there was a deep hollow to be felt above the patella, and he was lame. In none of these cases was the knee rendered stiff by extending it, and keeping it motionless. The extensor muscles are counteracted by the six follow- ing strongjlexor muscles. Ischio-Peroneus, or Biceps Flexor Cruris. This muscle consists of two parts; the longer is derived from the outer part of the tuberosity of the os ischium, in common with the semitendinosus, is covered by the glutseus maximus muscle, and lower down the thigh lies under the fascia, and the other from the middle of the linea aspera of the os femoris : below the insertion of the glutaeus maximus both parts unite, and are fixed into the outer part of the head of the fibula. This muscle forms the outer hamstring. Ischio-Sub-Tibialis, or Semimembranosus. This semipenniform muscle takes its rise from the upper and outer parts of the tuberosity of the os ischium, and the fibres are connected to a flat tendon, which is inserted into the upper and inner side of the tibia. Ischio-Proetibialis, or Semitendinosus* i This muscle also arises from the tuberosity of the os is- chium, and is inserted, by means of a strong rounded ten- don, into the upper and inner part of the tibia, about three inches from the knee. The leg is not only bent backwards, but also inwards, by this muscle. This and the preceding muscle form the larger share of the inner hamstring.

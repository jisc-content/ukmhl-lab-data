74 elements of anatomy. â€¢and lower surfaces of their bodies are more concave than in the vertebrae of the back. 2. The greater thickness of the intervertebral cartilages in front render the spine convex towards the abdomen. 3. The oblique processes are strong and deep; those in opposite sides being placed almost in parallel planes; the su- perior, which are concave, facing inwards, and the convex inferior ones facing outwards; and therefore each of these vertebrae receives the one above it, and is received by the one below. 4. Their transverse processes are small, long, and almost erect, for allowing large motion to each bone, and sufficient insertion to muscles, and for supporting and defending the internal parts. 5. A small protuberance may be observed at the roots of the superior oblique ancl transverse processes, for the insertion of the exterior muscles of the trunk of the body. 6. The spinal processes are strong, straight, and horizontal, with broad flat sides, and a narrow edge above and below; this last being depressed on each side by muscles; and, at the root of these edges, there are rough surfaces for fixing the ligaments. 7. The canal for the spinal cord is rather larger than in the vertebrae of the back. 8. The holes for the passage of the nerves are more equally formed out of both the contiguous vertebrae than in the other classes ; the upper one furnishes, howrever, the larger share of each hole. The thick cartilages between these lumbar vertebra, their deep oblique processes, and their erect spinal processes, are calculated to admit of extensive motion; though it is not so great as what is performed in the neck ; as appeal's from com- paring the arches which the head describes when moving on the neck, or the loins only. The oblique processes of the lower lumbar vertebras are at a greater distance from each other, and facing more backwards and forwards. The transverse and spinal processes of the third and fourth

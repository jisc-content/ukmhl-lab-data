The bones of the face are considerably larger in the adult, in proportion to those of the cranium, than in the infant, which are short, owing to the want of the teeth, and maxillary sinuses. In some Negroes, the upper and under jaws are much more prominent than in the European, but not equally so. The upper jaw of the greater number of the monkey tribe is still more prominent than that of the Negro. Dr Camper has grounded his method of marking the pe- culiarities of national conformation of the head, by placing the skull as nearly as possible as it rests on the atlas : he then draws one line along the profile, which touches the more prominent parts of the fore head and upper jaw, this he calls the facial line. He draws a second line in the opposite direction, or ho- rizontally across the head, through the meatus auditorius ex- ternus. The angle formed at the junction of these two lines, which he has called facial angle, is, according to Dr Camper, file index of the peculiar form of the skull. Thus he has endeavoured to prove the existence of a re- gular gradation, as the conformation of the skulls of diffe- rent nations, and also a gradation as to form, between the human skull and that of the inferior animals *. â€¢ Camper on the connection between the Science of Anatomy and the arts of drawing, painting and statuary, translated by Dr T.

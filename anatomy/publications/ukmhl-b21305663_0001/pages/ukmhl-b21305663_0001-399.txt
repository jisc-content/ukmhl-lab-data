353 OF THE NOMENCLATURE OF MUSCLES. 6th, There are annular tendinous ligaments, as at the wrists and ankles, which serve to fix down the round ten- dons, and to strengthen the bursae within which the tendons play. Lastly, Some tendons fix down other tendons : thus the tendons of the long flexor muscles of the fingers and toes pass through each other. Origin and Insertion of Muscles. A muscle is said by anatomists to consist of a belly and two extremities. The belly is composed of a great number of fleshy fibres; and to the extremities of many of the muscles a white glistening cord or membrane is connected, called ten- don, or tendinous aponeurosis, by which many of the muscles are fixed to the bones. The extremity, which is connected to the most fixed part, is named the head, or origin of the muscle; and the other extremity, fixed to the more moveable part, the insertion of the muscle. The greater number of the muscles by which we transport ourselves from place to place, are attached to, and supported by, the bones, and are laid over them in layers. In most cases, the muscle is stretched from one bone to another; or a muscle is said to arise from one bone, and to be inserted in- to another. Chemical Analysis of Muscles. This branch of animal chemistry is still involved in obscu- rity, owing to the difficulty of separating the muscular fibres from the blood, fat, and cellular substance, with which they are very intimately involved. To Messrs Tiiouvenel, Fourciioy, Vauquelin and Hat- chett, we are chiefly indebted for our knowledge of the che- mical composition of the muscular fibre. A muscle, when washed, is converted into a white fibrous substance, which retains the form of the muscle: this consists chiefly of fibrine ; 2d, of albumen ; 8d, of jelly ; 4th, pf ex- tractive; 5th of phosphate of soda: and Mr Hatchett dis- covered in beef, phosphate ot ammonia^and the phosphate VOL. i. 7

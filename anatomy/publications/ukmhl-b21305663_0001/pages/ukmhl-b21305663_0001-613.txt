567 OF THE LIVER. When a portion of the liver is dried,[ the fluid escapes, the surface being always covered with it like dew, as if it were a sort of oily or fatty fluid. One of the substances hardens or contracts more than the other, as appears from the dimpled aspect of the surface when drying. “ The liver is covered with a fine transparent and tough membrane.” We are not yet intimately acquainted with the chemical analysis of the liver. It does not readily putrefy. ' According to Braconnet, 100 parts of the parenchyma of the liver, consist of Water, - 68.64 Dry Albumen, - - - 20.19 Phosphoret Oil, - 6.07 A substance peu-azote'e, - - 0.10 Chlorure of Potassium, - - 0.64 What he calls Sel Organique, - 0.10 Phosphate de chaux ferrugineux, - 0.47 *. By drying, it loses considerably of its weight. When a section of the liver is made, it seems to be a po- rous substance. The branches of the vena portarum may be observed, in a collapsed state, accompanied by those of the hepatic artery, and those of the duct. These adhere to the substance of the liver, by the medium of a gelatinous sub- stance and cellular substance, in which the branches of the vena portae and hepatic artery are lodged; and the branches of the vena portae hepaticae may be observed converging to- wards the posterior surface of the liver. Every part of the liver is not necessary to life; and, not- withstanding the number and size of the bloodvessels proper to this organ, I have found that I could cut off one of the lobes of the liver, without killing the animal. The abdomen of a living rabbit was laid open, and one of the lobes of the liver was cut off. The animal did not express much pain du- ring the operation. At first there was a profuse bleeding from • Diet, de Med., tom. ix. p. 189. Paris, 1824.

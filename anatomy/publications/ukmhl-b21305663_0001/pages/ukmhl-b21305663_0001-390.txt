elements of anatomy. 344 sular ligaments, and also by other short ligaments called, from their situation, dorsal, 'plantar, lateral, and, from the direc- tion ol their fibres, straight, oblique, and transverse. Ligaments of the Phalanges of the Toes. The capsular and lateral ligaments of the phalanges of the toes are similar to those of the fingers, and the tendons of the extensor and flexor muscles are inclosed within similar sheaths, or oblong bursae. Before concluding respecting the ligaments, it may be observed, that the synovial membranes, like other serous membranes, are very frequently inflamed, which occasions an increased secretion of synovia, the effusion of coagulable lymph, or the thickening of the synovial membrane. According to Mr BitoniE, the inflammation of the synovial membrane has sometimes given rise to the destruction of the articular cartilages. A chronic inflammation of the synovial membrane, is also the consequence of the acute inflammation, of taking mercury, or of rheumatism, or it is occasioned by cold, and hence is most frequent in the knee and ankle joints. The chronic inflammation of the synovial membrane some- times leaves one joint, and attacks another. On account of the swelling of the joint occasioned by the fluid within the capsular ligament, the alteration in the form of the joint, and the great pain on motion, this case has some- times been mistaken for fracture of the head of the bones, or for a dislocation, the form of the joint being much changed owing to the distention of the synovial membrane by the in- cluded fluid ; hence the form of the diseased joint is modified by the contiguous tendons and ligaments, which resist in cer- tain directions, but yield in others.

422 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. The greater number of the muscles by which the head is moved, is placed between the vertebrae and occiput, by which the tendency of the head to fall forwards is counteracted. Hence the extensor muscles are in a state of constant action du- ring life; and when these muscles cease from action, as during sleep, the head falls forwards. The fibres of the greater number of these muscles are oblique, and they differ as to their obliquity. In conse- quence of the decussation of their fibres, the vertebras are more firmly united, and the head is moved with greater rapi- dity and steadiness, and in a greater number of diagonal lines. By the three following muscles, the head is drawn back- wards, or to a side, when the muscle of one side only is thrown into action. Cervico-Mastoideus, or Splenius Capitis. This muscle is covered by the trapezius; it is flat, and somewhat like a surgeon’s splent in form. It arises from the spinous processes of the four uppermost dorsal vertebras, and five lowest cervical vertebrae ; and proceeding upwards, is fixed into the occipital ridge and mastoid process of the tem- poral bone, and also into the transverse processes of the five uppermost cervical vertebrae. Trachelo-Occipitalis, Biventer Cervicis o/’Albixus, or Corn- plexus Major. This muscle is covered in part by the splenius ; the rest of it is seen between the splenius and the spine: it arises, by ten- dons, from the transverse processes of the four lower cervical vertebrae, and seven uppermost dorsal vertebrae. It forms a thick fleshy mass, in the middle of which there is a tendon, and at last terminates in the lower occipital ridge. Trachelo-Mastoideus, or Complexus Minor. This muscle arises from the five lowest vertebrae of the neck, and transverse processes of the three uppermost verte- brae of the back, and is fixed into the mastoid process of the

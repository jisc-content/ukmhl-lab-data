According to Prince Maximilian “ both men and women are entirely destitute of clothing ; the former were of middle size, strong, muscular, and well made, yet, in general, rather slender; but the great plugs of wood in their ears and lips disfigured them greatly j.” Prince Maximilian has made particular mention of their muscular power, and ability to endure fatigue. “ Their mus- cular strength enables them to go very swiftly in the hottest weather, both up and down hill ; they penetrate the thickest and most entangled forests ; they wade and swim through every river, if it be not too rapid ; perfectly naked, therefore not incommoded by clothing; never getting into perspira- tion ; carrying only their bow and arrow in their hand, and with their hardened skin, which fears neither thorns nor other injury, they creep through the smallest gap in the • Travels in Brazil, p. 312. 1820- + See a representation of the Skull in Blumenbach’s 6th Decade. t Travels, pages 2D 1.—293.

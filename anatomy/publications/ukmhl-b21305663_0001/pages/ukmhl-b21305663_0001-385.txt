SYNOVIAL APPA1IATUS OF THE HIP-JOINT. 339 articular cartilages, and also slight erosion of the brim of the acetabulum, this internal ligament, together with the synovial apparatus, was completely destroyed. A double cart'dago-ligamenious membrane is stretched across the breach in the inner and fore part of the acetabu- lum ; in the posterior part of which there is an aperture for lodging a part of the synovial apparatus. The bony margin of the acetabulum is encircled by a liga- ment, which adds considerably to its depth, and is called the cotyloid ligament. Owing to the greater shortness of the capsular ligament of the hip-joint, and the greater depth and immobility of the aceta- bulum, the movements of the thigh-bone are much more cir- cumscribed than those of the os humeri. The ligamentous fibres which pass from the anterior and superior, and anterior and inferior spinous processes of the os ilium, prevent the thigh-bone from being carried backward, bevond a perpendicular line drawn from the pelvis down- wards. Of the Synovial Apparatus of the Hip-Joint. The acetabulum is lined by the synovial membrane, which also covers the synovial apparatus of this joint, lodged within the acetabulum : it is then reflected over the internal li- gament of the joint, over the cartilage which covers the head of the thigh-bone, and also over the neck of the same bone. The synovial membrane is very vascular, and is supplied with blood from the smaller branches of the obturator ar- tery *. There are a number of fringes connected with the synovial apparatus, from which the synovia may be squeezed out. The edges of the synovial apparatus are retained in their situation, by small ligamentous fibres. *■ Vid. the synovial apparatus of this joint, represented of its natural size, in fig. 3. of Plate viii. of my Father’s hook on the Burs® Mucosa;, and magnified in fig. 4. of the same Plate.

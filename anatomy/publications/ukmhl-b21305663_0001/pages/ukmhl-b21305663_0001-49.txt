GENERAL OBSERVATIONS. 3 A description of the Bones. Of the Ligaments. Of the Muscles. Of the Bowels. Of the Glands. Of the structure and course of the Bloodvessels. Of the Nerves. The solids may be separated from the fluids by various means, as by exsiccation, expression, boiling, and putrefaction. The fluid part forms by far the larger proportion, so that when the body has been dried artificially, or when buried in dry sand, as in Arabia, it loses very much of its weight; I should suppose eight of ten parts. Of the Solid Parts of the Animal Frame. These are derived from the fluids. The solids are of different consistence, and therefore have been arranged under two heads, the Hard and the Soft. The latter consist chiefly of what has been called Animal Matter. The first class comprehends the Bones and Cartilages; and the second the Muscles, Viscera, Nerves, and all other parts. Some writers have also made mention of a Pulpy Substance, such as enters into the composition of the brain, salivary glands, pancreas, and a few other parts of the body. The solids, when mechanically divided, may be resolved into Layers, Fibres, or Filaments; and these several fibres are united by cellular substance, which envelopes, pervades, and joins these. Thus muscles are composed of fibres of a peculiar kind, united by cellular substance. Bones are also composed of fibres, united by cellular sub- stance, and of jelly, to which earthy matter is added, to give them the necessary solidity and rigidity. Tendons, ligaments, and the nerves, also consist of fibres. Thick, strong, and elastic fibres, united by cellular sub- stance, form the Membranes.

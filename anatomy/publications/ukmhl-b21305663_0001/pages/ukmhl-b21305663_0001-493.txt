MUSCLES OF THE INFERIOR EXTREMITIES. 447 It is smooth on its external surface, considerably thicker on the outer than on the inner side of the thigh, and not only covers, but also enters between the muscles of the thigh. The upper part of this fascia, which is very intimately in- terwoven with the crural arch, (in a manner to be afterwards more fully described), is covered by a very thin tendinous fascia, called the glandular fascia. The large vein, called vena saphcena major, runs between the fascia lata and the skin, and sinks beneath a crescent-like fold of fascia, to join the deep femoral vein. There are many small nerves which ramify above this fascia of the thigh, which are derived from the lumbar and anterior crural nerves ; and also a number of lymphatic glands, and lymphatic vessels, which appear like lines of a whitish colour, and enter the inguinal lymphatic glands, at the upper and inner part of the thigh. This fascia is connected to the crural arch ; to the sacro- sciatic ligaments; to the tendon of the glutaeus maximus and tensor vaginae femoris ; to the linea aspera, condyles of the thigh-bone, and patella; it is attached also to the upper parts of the tibia and fibula, and, being continued, forms the fascia of the leg. This fascia of the leg is connected to every projecting part of the bones, becoming thinner towards the under part of the leg, and where it passes over the ankle. It forms a strong annular or transverse ligament, which extends from the outer ankle and neighbouring part of the os calcis, and is fixed to the malleolus internus and os naviculare. This ligament binds down the tendons of the extensor muscles. There is a muscle proper to the upper part of the fascia,, called Ilio-Femoralis, or Tensor Vagina Femoris. This muscle arises from the external part of the anterior superior spinous process of the os ilium, and is fixed into the fascia, where it covers the upper and outer side of the thigh, a little below the trochanter major.

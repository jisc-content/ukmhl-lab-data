128 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. In consequence of the interposition of the sutures of the cranium, 1. The bones which are at some distance from each other at birth yield, whereby the shape of the head is accommodated to the form of the pelvis of the mother. Whence, in childbed, the bones of the cranium, during difficult labour, overlap each other. 2. The skull is more easily formed and extended into a spherical figure. 3. There is a free communication of the vessels without, and of those within the skull, larger here than in any other part of the cranium ; and therefore fomentations, cataplasms, blisters, and issues, are applied most efficaciously for the re- lief of diseases of the brain. . 4. The dura mater is more firmly fixed to the skull at this conjunction of the bones, with the greatest benefit. 5. By a suture, the course of a fracture, that is nearly spent, is sometimes arrested. 6. According to the late Mr Gibson of Manchester, the bones of the skull extend chiefly at the edges; the sutures admit of the intervention of a vascular membrane, which se- cretes the bony substance, and when ossification has been completed, the sutures are obliterated. Life is prolonged by a separation of the bones of the skull: thus the acute is converted into the chronic form of hydroce- phalus. Os Frontis. The os feontis forms a large share of the forehead. It is generally symmetrical, and has some resemblance in shape to .the shell of the concha bivalvis commonly called the cocldc; for the greatest part of it is convex and smooth externally, and concave internally, with a serrated circular edge; while the smaller part has processes and depressions, which make it of an irregular figure. This bone forms the upper and arched part of the socket for the eye-balls, called Superciliary Ridges, which are bound- ed outwardly by the external, and internally, or next to the nose, by the internal angular processes. a

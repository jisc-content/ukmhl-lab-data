XXX11 PREFACE. From the description of the muscles of the abdo- men, and parts connected with these, many infe- rences are drawn, relative to the different kinds of hernia;, or ruptures; and, when treating of the muscles of the extremities, observations on the position of the limbs in cases of fracture, dislocation of the bones, and in cases of laceration of the tendons of the muscles. In Part IV., which treats of the organs of Mastica- tion, Deglutition, Chymification, and Chylification, a very enlarged view is given of the organs subservient to these purposes in Man, and many of the inferior ani- mals. Mention is made of the natural peculiarities of the human teeth, and of those which occur in many of the inferior animals, and of the chemical analysis of the enamel and osseous part of the teeth, by Ber- zelius and Pepys. An account is also given of the discovery, by Mr Corse, of the structure and succession of the teeth of the elephant. In treating of the structure of the stomach, I have been favoured with a description of its internal sur- face, by my distinguished friend Dr Brewster, and I have added also the remarks of Mr Bauer and Dr Yellowly, upon the same subject. On the changes which the food undergoes within the Stomach, I have made many important extracts, from the observations of my Father, Dr Wilson Philip, Dr Hastings of Worcester, Chevreul, and Dr Prout. I have given a very enlarged account of the Struc- ture of the Liver, and of the nature of the Bile ; and have inserted an unpublished account of a very unusual distribution of the bloodvessels of the Liver, with which I was favoured by my late friend Mr Wilson, teacher of Anatomy in London.

42 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 3d, Schindylesis or ploughing *, when a thin lamella of one bone is received into a long narrow furrow of another : Thus the processus azygos of the sphenoid, and the nasal pro- cess of the ethmoid bone, are received by the vomer. The third class, or diarthrosis +, is the articulation where the bones are so loosely connected as to allow large motion. This is subdivided into three kinds : The first is enarthrosis, or the ball and socket, when a large head is received into a deep cavity; as the head of the os fe- moris is into the acetabulum coxendicis. The second is arthrodia, when a round head is received in- to a superficial cavity; as in the articulation of the arm-bone and scapula. These two species of diarthrosis allow motion to all sides. The third is ginglimus j, which properly signifies the hinge of a door or window. In it the parts of the bones mu- tually receive, and are received, and allow of motion two ways : Workmen call it charnel. The ginglimus is generally divided into three kinds, the contiguous ||, distant ยง, and compound ^j. The first kind of ginglimus is, when a bone has several pro- tuberances and cavities, corresponding to as many cavities and processes of the other bone with which it is articulated ; as in the conjunction of the femur with the tibia. The second species is, when a bone receives another at one end,,and is received by the same bone at the other end ; as in the radius and ulna. The last sort is, when a bone receives another, and is re- ceived by a third ; as the oblique processes of the vertebra. But though the preceding account of the diarthrosis, or ar- ticulation of moveable bones, has been almost universally re- ceived ; yet, seeing it does not comprehend all the moveable a Keil, Anat. chap. 5. ยง 3. + Airctgigdcrts, dearticulatio, abartioulatio. x Articulatio mutua. || Proximus. ยง Longns.

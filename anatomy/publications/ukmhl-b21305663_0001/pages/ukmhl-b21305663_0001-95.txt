OF THE FORMATION OF BONE. 49 surface is arranged into tubular plates of two different sizes, constituting a larger and a smaller series ; an arrangement by no means essential to the increase of a bone, because in many of the early stages of ossification, and also where the growth is very slow, the larger series is found to be entirely want- ing. In the flat bones of the skull, the circumstances under which ossification takes place, differ materially from those above described. In these, the phosphate of lime, in combination with the ani- mal mucilage, is occasionally deposited in small detached un- equal masses, without regularity, as if merely laid in the way, preparatory to their subsequent application: these soon be- come connected with the more central parts of the bone, and are found to decrease in thickness as they increase in breadth, until they are finally consolidated with the original plate of bone. Is Banc formed within cartilage or between membranes ? This is a point which has been very much disputed, as may be seen by consulting the works of Vesalius, Fallopius, Hallek, Albinus, Du Vereey, and other authors. Dr Macdonaldâ€™s experiments seem to have proved that what has commonly been stated to be cartilage, is either jelly or soft bone. In the human body, there are examples in which bone is formed on cartilage and also on membranes : in the extremi- ties it is formed on the former, and in the head on tthe lat- ter. Bone is frequently formed in cases of disease upon serous membranes, as upon the dura mater and its processes, the peritoneum and pleura. Further, the teeth are formed upon pulps which differ from membrane or cartilage. Before ossification begins upon cartilage, the cartilage is nearly of the same size as the bone which is about to be formed ; and, it may be proper to add, that it is still a ques- tion, whether or not the same vessels secrete the.Jjone which have secreted the cartilaginous substance. voT.. r.

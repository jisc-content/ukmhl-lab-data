419 MUSCLES OF THE SPINE. 1st, Into the muscles proper to the spine. 2d, Into muscles which move the ribs. Sd, Into muscles which move the head. 4th, Into muscles of the shoulder. Lastly, There is a muscle implanted in the back, the latis- simus dorsi, which is a muscle of the arm. MUSCLES OF THE SPINE. Sacro-Spinalis or Longissimus Dorsi. This long conical-shaped thick mass of flesh, which is co- vered by a strong tendinous aponeurosis, from which the mus- cular fibres take their rise, and pass obliquely upwards, fills up the hollow between the spine and angles of the ribs. It is connected in common with the sacro-cpstalis, by a strong tendon, with the os sacrum, and spinous processes of the lumbar vertebrae, and is fixed by distinct tendons into the lower edges of all the ribs, except the two lower, and in- to the transverse processes of the dorsal vertebrae, by small double tendons. The multifidus spinae, complexus and trans- versalis colli lie on its inner, and the following muscle on its outer edge. Sacro-Costalis, or Sacro-Lumbalis. This muscle may be said to form a part of the preceding muscle : it takes it origin, in common with it, from the side of the spinous processes of the os sacrum, and from the spinous and transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae. This muscle is fixed by flat, long, and thin tendons into the angles of all the ribs. This and the preceding muscle keep the trunk of the body erect; and, when the trunk of the body has been bent, they bring it back to a state of extension. From the eight lower ribs, an equal number of fleshy fasciculi take their rise, which terminate on the inner side of this muscle, and form the muscle. This muscle assists the former in maintaining the trunk of the body erect. When the spine has been slightly distorted, the scapulae are not bn the same level. The longissimus dorsi Â» d 2

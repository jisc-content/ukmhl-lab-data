IVhere the ribs and their cartilages are distorted in rickety persons, the breast-bone is generally also deformed. CHAP. IX. OF THE SKULL. •i : i ■ i The bones of the Skull have been divided into those of the cranium, and of the face. The cranium *, helmet, or brain-case, consists of several pieces, which form a vaulted cavity, for lodging and defend- ing the brain and cerebellum, with their membranes, vessels, and nerves. The cranium is neither so broad nor so deep at pts fore part, in which the anterior lobes of the brain are lodged, as it is behind, where the posterior lobes of the brain and cerebel- lum are contained. The bones of the face, which constitute the under part of the skull, are irregular in form, and various in point of size, in different individuals, in the two sexes, tand in different nations. The bones of the skull correspond with the form and size of the parts included within them ; hence the striking diffe- rence in their form in the human race, and in the inferior ani- mals. There is a most striking disproportion in the two great com- ponent parts of the skull in man, and in the inferior animals : in the former, the part of the skull appropriated to the lodge- * K*VT«{, xaSetee, <nto<p(or, calva, calvaria, cerebri galea, theca et olla capitis, testa capitis, scutella capitis.

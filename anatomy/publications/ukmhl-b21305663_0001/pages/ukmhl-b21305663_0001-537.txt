OF THE TEETH. 491 ing teeth, are in contact; the canine are lodged deeper in the jaw. About the twentieth month, the canine teeth show themselves: in the first place those of the under jaw, and soon after those of the upper jaw. The Caninus appears after the first molares, or about the sixteenth or twentieth month ; as it is out of the line, and, till the jaw extends, there is not room for it; and the jaw at this place grows in a greater proportion than at any other part. The posterior or larger molares appear between the twenty- fifth and thirtieth month. It may not be improper to add, that there is a great irregu- larity as to the time the teeth are cut. Of the Shedding of the First Set of Teeth, and of the appearance of the Second Set. As there is the utmost variety with regard to the time at which the teeth appear, so there is very great variety respect- ing the time at which teeth are shed. In a child at birth, the rudiments of the first and second sets are found within the jaw; the basis of the second set are formed long before they first cut the gum. Whilst the first are receiving roots, and cutting the gum, the second set is dormant, and continues so, long after the first have appeared. About the sixth year, all the second set, excepting the wis- dom teeth, are ossified ; so that, at this period, there are no less than forty-eight teeth in the jaws : the first set, consisting of twenty, have appeared ; and the second set, consisting of twenty-eight, lie within the jaws. The sixth tooth, or first large molaris of the adult, is also dormant. The first set of teeth fall out, in consequence of their roots being absorbed, which absorption takes place in consequence of the enlargement of the second set; by which, pressure is made on the bony partitions between the sockets of the first and second set of teeth, and also on the roots of the first set of teeth; which leads to the absorption of the bony partitions, as well as of the roots of the first set.

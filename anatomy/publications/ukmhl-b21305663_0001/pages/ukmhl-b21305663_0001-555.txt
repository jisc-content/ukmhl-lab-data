OF THE PHARYNX'. 50D The epiglottis, covering the projecting larynx, is seen con- nected with the tongue, at the fore-part of the pharynx, but when the tongue has been pulled forwards, the epiglottis is raised. The larynx occupies the fore-part of the pharynx; and hence is raised at the same time as the pharynx. The internal membrane of the pharynx is a mucous mem- brane, and it is lined by a thin cuticle. The pharynx is covered behind by a thin, though very distinct, stratum of muscular fibres, which follow an oblique course. The fibres of the right and left sides meet together in the middle, in a white longitudinal line. Anatomists who preceded Albinus, divided this stratum into eight muscles, which they named from their attachments, and described these as distinct muscles, under the names Ce- phalo-Pharyngei, Pterygo-pharyngei, Mylo-pharyngei, Glos- so-pharyngei, Hyo-pharyngei, Syndesmo-pharyngei, Thyro- pharyngei, and Crico-pharyngei. Modern authors have divided these into three muscles on- ly, under the names of Constrictor Pharyngis Superior, Me- dius, and Inferior. As all these fibres have a similar insertion, and are subser- vient to a similar purpose I shall describe them as one muscle only. The upper part of the constrictor pharyngis takes its ori- gin from the basis of the cranium, from the jaws, palate, and root of the tongue; it surrounds the upper part of the pharynx; and the lowrer portion of the muscle arises from the thyroid and cricoid cartilages of the Larynx, and passes for- wards to meet with its fellow. This stratum of muscular fi- bres contracts upon the bolus of food, and pushes it down- wards into the gullet. Stylo-pharyngeus. This muscle takes its origin from the styloid process of the temporal bone; and, passing downwards and forwards, is fixed into the side of the pharynx, and into the back-part of the thyroid cartilage of the larynx.

MUSCLES OF THE ARM. 431 obliquely to the tubercle of the humerus, it gives the hu- merus a degree of flexion. Scapulo-Humcralis, or Teres Major. This muscle arises from the dorsal side of the inferior an^Ie o of the scapula, and is fixed into the ridge, at the inner side of the groove for lodging the long head of the scapulo-radialis, alone- with the tendon of the latissimus dorsi. The use of O this muscle is to roll the os humeri inwards, in which it is as- sisted by the latissimus dorsi; and, when we act with the la- tissimus dorsi and teres, the palm of the hand is turned back- wards, ready to grasp any body behind us. Sub-Scapulo- Trochineus, or Sub-Scapularis. This muscle is concealed by the scapula, and fills up the space under it; from the three costae of that bone, it takes its origin. The radiated fibres of this muscle make prints upon the bone. It is fixed into the smaller tuberosity of the os hu- meri, which it rolls inwards. Sub-Acromio-Humeralis, or Deltouleus. This thick and strong mass of flesh, which lies under the skin, and forms the upper and outer portion of the shoulder, covering the ball of the os humeri, is broad above, and narrow below, and in form bears some resemblance to the Greek a. It consists of various fasciculi. This muscle arises from the sternal half of the clavicle, from the acromion, and part of the spine of the scapula; it gradually becomes narrower, and is fixed, by a strong tendon, into a rough sur- face on the outer side of the os humeri near to its middle. This muscle covers the insertion of the greater pectoral mus- cle, and the origins of the biceps flexor cubiti and coraco-bra- chialis. This muscle has, by some authors, been divided into three distinct parts, and has been represented as three different muscles by Leonardo da Vinci in his anatomical drawings *. • These drawings are in hb Majesty’s collection, and engravings from them have been published by Mr Chambeblaihk.

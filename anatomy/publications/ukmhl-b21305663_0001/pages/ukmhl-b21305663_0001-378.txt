332 ELEMENTS OF ANATOM V. eel out, to prevent the head striking the ground; in which case, the lore-arm slips behind the os humeri. There is an annular ligament, which encircles the neck of the radius, and is fixed to the opposite sides of the semilunar cavity of the ulna. By this ligament, the radius is fixed down, during the pronation and supination of the hand. There are a number of additional ligamentous fibres which pass over the capsular ligament, in different directions, which have been named accessory ligaments. Sir A. Cooper has described “ a band of ligamentous fibres crossing from the side of the coronoid process to the olecra- non, and upon the radial side of the ulna, the upper portion of the coronary ligament of the radius passing from the side to the olecranon towards the neck of the radius. If the ole- cranon be broken off, and these ligamentous fibres be left en- tire, tbe olecranon will remain still united* to the ulna, by means of these ligamentous productions, which I should not have noticed, but for their influence on fractures of this bone.” This joint is much strengthened by the tendons of the mus- cles passing over the joint. Ligaments between the Radius and Ulna. There is a strong ligamentous membrane, extending be- tween the sharp ridges of the radius and ulna, the fibres of which extend obliquely downwards and inwards, which is cal- led, on account of its situation, Interosseous Ligament. This ligament is perforated in several places by bloodves- sels, and there is a large opening at the upper part ot it, which is filled by muscles. This ligament not only binds together the radius and ulna, and limits the rotation of the radius, but also gives origin to many muscular fibres. There is a capsular ligament which incloses the carpal end of the ulna, which arises from the edges of the semilunar ca- vity at the carpal end of the ulna. Ligaments between the Fore-Arm and Wrist. There is a capsular ligament extending between the mm-

In treating of the Lungs, I have inserted a paper on the minute structure of these organs, which was written by my Father, and read to the Royal Society, at a meeting held January 1767, but never published, containing all the knowledge we now possess regard- ing the structure of these important organs, with the exception of one or two facts lately discovered by Reisseisen. I have also noticed the experiments of Dr Davy, regarding the extrication of air from the air-cells of the lungs into the pleura.

MUSCLES 0£ THE LEG. 455 Ilio-Prce- Tibialis, or Sartor Ins. This muscle, which arises from the anterior and superior spinous process of the os ilium, between the crural arch and tensor vaginalis femoris, passes for some way upon the rectus cruris, then across the vastus interims, the triceps and ab- ductor magnus, or in a spiral direction across the fore-part of the thigh, and behind the inner condyle of the thigh-bone, and is inserted into the upper and inner part of the tibia by a broad thin tendon, immediately below the anterior tubercle of the tibia, above the tendons of the gracilis and semiten- dinosus. If we pull the sartorius when the leg is straight, the leg is drawn close on the thigh, but not bent; but after the leg has been bent by its flexor muscles, the sartorius, being thrown behind the joint of the knee, is employed as a flexor, and, on account of the length of its fibres, its action is considei’able. By this muscle the leg is bent obliquely inwards on the thigh. Pubo-Prcetibialis, or Gracilis. \ The origin of this muscle is from the lower part of the symphysis pubis, on the inner side of the origins of the tri- ceps abductor femoris: it decends along the inner side of the thigh, to be inserted into the tibia, below the sartorius muscle. This muscle assists in the flexion of the knee, after it has been bent by the flexors of the leg. Poplito- Tibialis, or Popliteus. This muscle is concealed by the gastrocnemius; it extends between the external condyle of the thigh-bone, the back-part of the capsular ligament of the joint, and the internal and upper part of the tibia. By this muscle, the leg is not only bent; but when bent it is rolled inwards. The muscles above described as the flexors and extensors of the leg become its rotators, when the leg is bent, by acting alter- nately. Thus the internal and external flexors of the leg, the

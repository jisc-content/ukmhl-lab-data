OP THE LOWER JAW. 181 thrown to the side opposite to the luxation, and the incisor teeth are not in a line with the axis of the face ; but, in the lat- ter, or subluxation, the consequence of extreme relaxation, the condyle quits the interarticular cartilage of the temporal ca- vity, slipping before its edge, and lacking the jaw with the mouth slightly opened. It generally happens that this state is quickly removed by natural efforts alone *. Exostoses of a -very considerable size sometimes grow from the under jaw. In a child borne to the full time, the lower jaw is composed of two bones, connected by a thin cartilage in the middle of the chin. In each of these bones, there are five or six sockets -for teeth as in the upper jaw. ■The. two pieces which compose the under jaw may be se- parated by pulling the chin during difficult labour. In early life the coronoid and condyloid processes are shorter propor- tionally than in the adult, and do not form with the body of the under jaw an acute angle as in the meridian of life, but ascend obliquely. The bodies of the teeth are lodged in the alveolar processes, with a second set beneath them; and as we get more teeth the jaws are elongated. In old age, in consequence of the teeth falling out, the al- veolar processes are, in a great measure, absorbed; the jaws lose considerably of their breadth, the angle of the jaw returns to its infantile form,-and the under jaw projects considerably beyond the upper-f*. • Vide Page 393. of the 1st edition of his Treatise on Dislocation. ■f For a more full account of the articulation of the lower jaw, vjd.

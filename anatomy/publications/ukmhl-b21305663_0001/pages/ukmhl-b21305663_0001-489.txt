443 MUSCLES BETWEEN THE FINGERS. Of the Muscles between the Fi ngers called Metacarpo-Plia- langei Later ales, or Inter ossei. There are two strata of interossei muscles, an external and internal. These muscles take their origin from the sides of the me- tacarpal bones, and are fixed by slender tendons, into the ten- dinous expansions of the extensor digitorum communis. Bv these muscles, the fingers are moved laterally, and they also assist in bending or extending the phalanges of the fin- gers. There are four interossei interni in the palm of the hand. The lÂ«tf, called prior indicis, takes its origin from the outer part of the metacarpal bone of the fore-fingers, and is inserted into the outer side of the first phalanx of that finger. By this muscle, the fore-finger is drawn towards the thumb. The 2d, named posterior indicis, arises from the root and inner side of the metacarpal bone of the fore-finger, and is in- serted into the inner side of the first phalanx of the fore-fin- ger. By this muscle, that finger is drawn outwards. The 3d, named prior annularis, arises from the root and outer side of the metacarpal bone of the ring-finger, and is in- serted into the outer side of the first phalanx of the same fin- ger. By this muscle, the ring-finger is drawn towards the thumb. The 4tli, named interosseus auricularis, takes its rise from the root and outer side of the metacarpal bone of the little finger, and is inserted into the outer side of the first phalanx of the little finger. By this muscle, the little finger is drawn outwards. There are only three interossei externi, called bicipites: these are larger than the internal, and are situated between the metacarpal bones on the back of the hand. Prior medii digiti, arises from the corresponding sides of the metacarpal bones of the fore and middle fingers, and is fixed into the inner side of the tendon on the back of the mid- dle finger.

ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 496 The lips and cheeks, which extend from the cheek-bones, upper jaw, and front of the nose, to cover the teeth, are com- posed of skin, cellular substance, fat, muscles, glands, and hairs. In the lips there is a much smaller proportion of fat than in the cheeks; hence these are nearly of the same thickness at all times of life. The fat collected in the cheeks may tend not only to facilitate the movements of the muscles, but also to defend the mucous and salivary glands. The lips and cheeks are lined by a soft, vascular, mucous membrane, which forms the fraena of the lips; and then, be- coming somewhat firmer, forms the gums, by means of which the teeth are secured in their sockets. A single or a double fissure is not uncommon in the upper lip. The former of these malconformations gives the lip a resemblance to a hareâ€™s lip, and the latter to the lip of the Lion. This malconformation of the lip is often combined with a fissure in the palate, and even in the mouth. The cheeks and lips are largely supplied with blood; and, after their bloodvessels have been successfully filled, a number of pointed bodies may be observed on the lips, which project from their surface, and have been called Villi. The gums are spongy, and of a red colour, from the quantity of blood they receive. SECTION III. OF THE PALATE. The roof of the mouth has been called Palate. The palate is made up of hard and soft parts. In the erect posture it is placed horizontally. The bony part of the palate consists of the palatine processes of the superior maxillary bones, and of the palate-bones ; and these form, in the adult, a bony arch. The membrane of the palate describes, in middle life, a por- tion of an ellipse; but, in advanced life, the palate, instead of being elliptical, becomes nearly level, in consequence of the loss of the teeth, and the absorption of the alveolar processes which

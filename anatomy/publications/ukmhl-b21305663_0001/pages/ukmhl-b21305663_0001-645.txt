OF THE SPLEEN. 597 SECTION IV. OF THE SPLEEN. The Spleen is an organ which varies much in size and' form in different animals. In quadrupeds, it is larger than in man, and not so much rounded in its shape; and, in all animals, is of a soft texture, somewhat spongy to the touch, very easily torn, and, when torn, is generally found to con- tain a good deal of blood, and to consist chiefly of blood- vessels, the smaller branches of which form an intimate net- work ; and hence it has, by some authors, been said to be made up, in part, of a number of cells. The human spleen, in a very recent subject, is of a greyish- blue colour, which, in a few hours, changes into a purple, so that it resembles a mass of clotted blood ; it is somewhat varia- ble as to shape and length, averaging between 4 and 6 inches. The spleen has nearly a vertical position, and occupies a share of the left hypochondriac region, between the left ex- tremity of the stomach and the corresponding false ribs, but changes its place a little, along with the stomach, with which it is connected by bloodvessels, peritonaeum, cellular- substance,, and the greater omentum ; or when compressed by that organ,, and also during inspiration and expiration. The spleen may be divided into a convex and concave surface, and into two4 extremities. The upper convex surface is received into a corresponding concavity of the diaphragm, and retained in that situation by the reflected peritonaeum, and the concave surface is directed towards the spine. There is a distinct longitudinal fissure, which divides it into an anterior and posterior plane, at which the bloodvessels and nerves enter the liver, and the absorbent vessels pass out from that organ, in their progress to the tho- racic duct. The under extremity of the spleen lies over the upper part of the left kidney, to which it is fixed by the peri- tonaeum. There are often deep fissures on the edges of the spleen.

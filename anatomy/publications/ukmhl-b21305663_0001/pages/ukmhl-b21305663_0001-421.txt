GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE BURSA MUCOSA, VESICA UNGUINOSA, OR BURSA SYNOVIALES. • The term Bursa Mucosa was applied by Albinus to cer- tain shut sacs, which he discovered placed under the tendons of the muscles. Albinus has enumerated only 16 pairs of these, not being aware that tendons within sheaths were pro- vided with similar, but oblong-shaped bursae. My Father discovered many of the bursae, and has described, in his Trea- tise on these shut sacs, 140 of them ; and since he published, several small bursae have been discovered in the head, neck and trunk of the body, which have been described and deli- neated by Dr Rosenmuller of Leipsic. The bursae mucosae are of different sizes in different parts of the body, and in proportion to the bulk of the body, are larger in a child than in an adult, and are interposed between such parts as rub violently upon each other. They are con- nected by cellular substance to the capsular ligaments, mus- cles, and their tendons, in such a manner as to lessen the ef- fect of attrition. I si. The bursae are situated between bones,—as between the clavicle and coracoid processes of the scapula.

elements of ANATOMY. 334 Articular Ligaments of the Metacarpal Bones. There are capsular or articular, and also lateral ligaments, placed at the sides of these joints, for the sake of additional security. There are also ligaments extending between the bases of the metacarpal bones, which are placed transversely, and fix these bones firmly to each other ; and which have been named palmar and dorsal ligaments. There are also interosseous ligaments at the heads of the metacarpal bones, which in the palm of the hand are trans- verse, and fix the heads of these bones to each other. The joints of the metacarpus are rendered more secure be- fore, by the sheaths for the tendons of the flexor muscles, and behind, by the tendons of the extensor muscles. Ligaments for Retaining the Tendons of the Muscles of the Hand, Fingers, and Thumb. There are vaginal ligaments, lined with bursae muscosae, which inclose the tendons of the flexor digitorum sublimis, and also those of the flexor digitorum profundus. There are crucial ligaments, which bind down the tendons of the flexor muscles. There are also accessory ligaments of the flexor tendons, which arise from the first and second phalanges of the fingers; and are lodged within the vaginal ligaments, which terminate in the tendons of the flexor muscles, and assist in retaining the tendons of the flexor muscles in their places. The tendons of the extensor muscles are united by trans- verse ligaments, near to the heads of the metacarpal bones, and are thus retained in their places.

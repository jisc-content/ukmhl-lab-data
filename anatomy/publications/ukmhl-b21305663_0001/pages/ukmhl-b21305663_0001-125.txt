79 OF THE PELVIS. j>ose it is more expanded in man behind, and also laterally, than in the inferior animals; for, in the latter, the distance between the opposite sides of the pelvis is so trifling, that they cannot, without a great effort, maintain an erect position even for a short time, for the ossa innominata are small, and the os sacrum and ossa coccygis are in the same line as the vertebral column ; and therefore ill calculated for supporting the bowels of the pelvis, when they are pressed downwards by the power- ful action of the diaphragm and abdominal muscles. The prominent and thick tubei'osities of the ossa ischia form a basis on which we rest in sitting, and as these bones are parallel to each other, and to the line of gravity of the body, the body is equipoised when we sit erect; whereas, if the os sacrum and ossa coccygis had formed a part of the same straight line as the spine, they must have projected be- yond the other bones, and have prevented us from sitting; and, it may be added, that the peculiar direction of these bones, renders the inferior animals retro-mingent and retro- copulent. The greater breadth of the bones of the pelvis gives suffi- cient room for the large and powerful extensor muscles, which keep the body erect; hence the much greater bulk of the human hips. The pelvis is composed of three large flat shaped bones, the os sacrum and ossa innominata, which are intimately con- joined by very peculiarly constructed joints, by strong and numerous ligaments, and by muscles. The ossa coccygis are fixed to the lower and smaller ex- tremity of the os sacrum, and are appendages to that bone : they are so situated, as to give a certain degree of support to. the intestinum rectum, and, when drawn backwards, the lower aperture of the pelvis is thereby increased. The mechanical disposition of the component bones of the pelvis is admirably constructed for supporting the superin- cumbent weight. The os sacrum, which is somewhat triangular in shape,, having the longest side of the triangle uppermost, is firmly 2

ELEME^TS of anatomy. 404 Mr Pott remarks, â€œ that the mere stricture made by the tendon in the generality of incarcerated rupture, is not only a sufficient, but the primary, and indeed sole, cause of the symptoms, and of all the mischiefan opinion which may lead to the supposition, that tendons are capable of contrac- tion on the application of a stimulus. But tendons possess no contractile power, and if the size of the under abdominal aperture had been diminished by the spasmodic contraction of the external oblique muscle, this must have been felt by the patient, or by any one who ex- amined it. The tendon is not the active cause; the pressure is occa- sioned by more of the intestine or omentum being forced into the Under Abdominal Aperture, than can lie there without being much compressed, and the mischief does not result from the Aperture being less, but from its contents being greater; for when the bowels have been suddenly protruded, where there is no predisposition to hernia, the tendinous columns of the Under Abdominal Aperture cannot receive the bowel or bowels which are out of the abdomen, without making great and dangerous pressure upon these. And in a rupture of some duration, even where the inguinal canal has been extended, and where an extraordinary portion of the intestines has, from any cause, been forced down, the strangulation is not occasioned by the spasmodic contraction of the tendinous columns of the external oblique muscle. The remedies that are usually employed with the greatest success for the cure of hernias, afford an additional argument in favour of the above opinion. Supposing the strangulation to be owing to the contraction of the tendinous fibres of the Under Inguinal Aperture, or of the Crural Aperture, the application of cold water, vine- gar, snow, or ice, instead of removing the disorder (which they certainly sometimes do) should, by bringing on a great- er degree of contraction in the Tendinous Apertures, render the disease still more obstinate; whilst, on the other hand, warm fomentations, which induce relaxation, should always pj.ove an antidote to the disorder, whereas they do much

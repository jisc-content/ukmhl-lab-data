144 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. In an infant, a small fissure is to be observed between the thin upper part, and the lower craggy part of each of these bones; which points out the recent union of these parts. The mastoid and styloid processes are awanting. Instead of a bony funnel-like external meatus auditorius, there is only a smooth bony ring, within which the membrane of the drum is fasten- ed. At the entry of the Eustachian tube, the side of the tympanum is not completed. A little more outwardly than the internal auditory canal, there is a deep pit, over the upper part of whose orifice the interior semicircular canal of the car is stretched; and some way below this, the posterior semicir- cular canal also appears. There is a specimen in the museum, in which there is no ap- pearance of either of the meatus auditorii. Os Occipitis. The Os Occipitis, so called from its situation, is convex externally, and concave internally. Its figure is an irregular square, or rather rhomboid ; of which the angle above is ge- nerally a little rounded; the two lateral angles are more fi- nished, but obtuse; and the lower one is stretched forward in form of a wedge, and thence is called by some the cuneiform process. The several turns of the edges of the os occipitis make in fact five or seven sides, and as many angles. The external surface is convex, except at the cuneiform apophyse, where it is flattened. On each side of the foramen magnum ossis occipitis, but more advanced forwards than the middle of it, there are large oblong protuberances, named the condyles, by which this bone is connected with the first vertebra of the neck. These condyles are not exactly uniform as to form and size. The smooth surface of each of these condyloid processes is longest from behind forward, where, by their oblique situa- tion, they come much nearer to each other than they are at their back part. Their inner sides are lower than the exter- nal ; thus they are prevented from sliding to either side out

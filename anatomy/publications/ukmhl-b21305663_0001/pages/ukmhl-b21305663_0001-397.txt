OF THE TENDONS OF MUSCLES. 351 « 1. Muscular fibres, in consequence of their office, have considerable strength and toughness; whereas the nerves, even when covered with their pia mater, (which those very authors suppose them to lay aside at their terminations), are pulpy and soft. “ 2. The matter which we know for certain to be medul- lary or nervous, does not appear to be endowed with the power of contracting when irritated. “ 3. As the nerves consist of threads laid parallel to each other, and which do not, like the bloodvessels, divide into branches, the bulk of which greatly exceeds that of the trunks which produce them, how are we to conceive that a small nerve can form a much larger mass of flesh ? “ 4. If the muscles were formed by the extremities of the nerves, they should shrink very remarkably on cutting the nerves, instead of which, I have observed no sensible altera- tion in the appearance of the muscles of the thigh and leg of a frog, upwards of a year after I had cut across its spinal mar- row or sciatic nerves. “ Muscles, or muscular fibres, seem, therefore, to be organs sui generis, not produced by the nerves, but merely influen- ced by the energy they convey * ” Tendons of Muscles. The tendons, like the muscles, are in structure fibrous, but their fibres are white, small, and closely united to each other, and have a shining silvery appearance. The fibres of tendons, are very tough, and possess very little elasticity. In many in- stances, the fibres of the tendons are evidently collected into fasciculi of considerable size. There are but few bloodvessels proper to tendons, and no nerves or lymphatic vessels. In many of the tendons, the fibres follow nearly the same direction as the fibres of the muscles: hence tendons have been stated by some authors to be muscles indurated by pres- sure. But the direction of the fibres of the tendons is, in Vide Nervous System, p. 90. and 91.

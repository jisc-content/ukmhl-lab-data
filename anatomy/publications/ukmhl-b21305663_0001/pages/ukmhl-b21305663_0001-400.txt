ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 3.54 and carbonate of lime. Muscular flesh, by boiling, yields jel- ly, albumen, a peculiar extractive matter described by Thou- vknel, phosphate of soda and ammonia, and a fibrous sub- stance like fibrine. Nomenclature of Muscles. The muscles of the human body have been named by Douglas, Albinus, Innes, and other authors, from their size* * * § breadth-}* and length J, form§, their being straight |j, or obliquely, from their situation**, or supposed office-}”}-; but there are many objections to such names. In the following pages, it is proposed to adopt such names as are descriptive of the situation of the muscles ; and where a muscle has several origins, it is necessary to employ such a name as describes the chief origins and insertions only, in or- der to avoid words of many syllables. Classification of Muscles. There have been two methods of arranging the muscles. According to the one, muscles are arranged according to their uses; according to the other, from their situation. The lat- ter is the method of Albinus, which has been adopted by most of the modern anatomists. Such a method is, perhaps, the most natural, and most fa- vourable for teaching dissection, but it communicates a very imperfect idea of their uses, and of the mode in which they antagonize each other. • Greater and smaller pectoral muscle. -f Latissimus Dorsi, Vasti interni et externi, &e. + Longissimus dorsi, Longus colli, &c. § Deltoid, Rhomboid, Scaleni, Trapezii, &c. || Rectus abdominis, Rectus cruris, &c, Obliqui abdominis, Obliqui capitis, &c. •• Glutei, Pectoral, Orbiculares oculi, &c. +-|- Biceps flexor cubiti; Biceps flexor cruris ; Attollens aurem : Corrugator supercilii; Levator, Depressor, Adductor, Abductor oculi; Sartorius, &x.

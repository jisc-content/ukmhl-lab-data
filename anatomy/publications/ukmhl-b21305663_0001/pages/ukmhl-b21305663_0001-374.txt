328 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. There is an internal transverse ligament of the atlas, which serves to keep the processus dentatus in its place, and to pre- vent it from passing backwards, and compressing the spinal marrow. There are capsular ligaments of the oblique processes of the lowest lumbar vertebrae, and which fix this bone to the sacrum, and also transverse ligaments for uniting the lowest lumbar vertebrae to the posterior and internal surfaces of the os ilium. Ligaments of the Ribs. The ribs are united before to the sternum or to cartilages *, and behind by capsular ligaments to the vertebrae. The cartilages of the ribs are united to each other by a per- pendicular ligament. The heads of the ribs are retained in their places by capsu- lar ligaments, by which they are joined to the vertebrae, and intervertebral cartilages. The ribs are united by their tubercles to the transverse pro- cesses of the dorsal vertebrae, by capsular ligaments. There are also internal and external ligaments of the necks of the ribs. The former originate from the superior margin of the neck of the ribs, and are fixed into the inferior surfaces of the transverse processes of the dorsal vertebrae immediately above ; and the latter, which arise from the upper margin of the necks of the ribs, are inserted into the external margin of the inferior oblique process of the vertebrae above. Ligaments of the Breast-Bone. There is a thick ligamentous sheath which covers the breast-bone, the fibres of which may be observed passing in different directions. There are also ligaments which arise from the cartilages oi the seventh rib, and are fixed into the ensiform cartilage. * In pages 111 and 112, the reader will find a full account of tho manner in, which the cartilages of the ribs are connected to the breast-bone.

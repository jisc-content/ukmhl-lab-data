of the Bloodvessels of muscles. im Bloodvessels of' Muscles. The bellies of muscles of the class Mammalia derive their red colour from the number of bloodvessels which are dis^ persed through their whole substance ; for them fibres, when- steeped in water, become grey or white, and very like to the fibrina of the blood. The bloodvessels pass between the larger fasciculi of the muscle. As the quantity of blood varies in the different mus- cles, so does the colour, which seems to depend on the frequency of employment of the muscles; for even in the same ani- mal, the colour of the muscle differs in the wild and domes- tic : Thus, the pectoral muscles of the wild duck are of a red colour, and those of the legs are pale; and the reverse holds true in the domestic cluck. The bloodvessels and absorbent vessels bear, generally speaking, a ratio to the size of the muscle, and increase in size when the muscle increases in size ; of which, the uterus affords a striking illustration; for, in its gravid state, the blood- vessels and absorbent vessels are much larger than in the vir- gin state. When the action of the muscles is slow, the blood passes through a number of small branches, lest it should too quickly arrive at its destination. When muscles have not been exercised, they lose consider- ably of their bulk, and less blood is sent to them; the same quantity of blood is not, in these circumstances, necessary.. In short, the blood seems to be essentially necessary ; for, du- ring vigorous exertion of the muscles, the bloodvessels of the muscles are thrown into violent action, and swell out; and they again subside, when the muscles have ceased to. act- Lymphatic vessels of Muscles. Besides bloodvessels, the muscles have large and numerous lymphatic vessels. It is probable that we have as yet discovered only a few of the lymphatic vessels which are proper to the human muscles; for the valves of these vessels perform their office so accurate-

378 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. CHAP. II. OF THE PARTICULAR MUSCLES. SECTION I. OF THE MUSCLES OF THE HEAD AND NECK. There is considerable difficulty in exposing these muscles, as they are thin, mixed with fat and cellular substances, in- corporated with each other, and attached to the skin- On the forehead is seen the frontal part of the Occipito- Frontalis Muscle; and a small part of that muscle which de- scends to the root of the nose. At the side of the head, there is a thin muscle which raises the ear, and covers the temporal muscles; and before the ear, a small muscle, which pulls the ear forwards; and around the eyeballs, the muscle called Orbicularis Palpebrarum oc- curs. On the cartilages affixed to the bones of the nose, and which form the Ake Nasi, a few thin scattering fibres are placed, which form a muscle, called, from its office, Compres- sor Narium. Arising from the side of the nose, and superior maxillary bone, there is a thin muscle passing down to be fixed into the upper lip, and which has been named, from its office, the Levator Labii Superioris Aloeque Nasi. There are three small muscles which pass obliquely down- wards and inwards, to be fixed to the corners of the mouth. Two of these have been named, from their origins from the Zygoma, Zygomatici; and the third has been named, from its office, Levator Anguli Oris. There is a triangular-shaped muscle which arises from the side of the chin, and which is fixed into the corner of the mouth, which has been named, from its office, the Depressor Auguli Oris.

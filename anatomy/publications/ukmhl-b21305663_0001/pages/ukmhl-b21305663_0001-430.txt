ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY, 384 as in the act of suction, and is the antagonist of the greater number of muscles of the mouth. A part of this muscle forms the Nasalis Labii Superiorisof Albinos. This muscle possesses a very extensive sphere of action; for it may be contracted and corrugated to such an extent, as to embrace a pin ; and it may be expanded, so as to admit all the fingers. The external part of this muscle tends to turn the lips inside out, or to shew the red part of the lips. Zygomata-Labialis Major and Minor, or the Zygomaticus Major and Minor. These are thin and small muscles, which descend obliquely downwards and inwards, to the corners of the mouth. They arise from the convexity of the Os Ma'fe, descend obliquely forwards, and terminate in the corner of the mouth, where their fibres are incorporated with those of the Depressor Anguli Oris. When the muscles of opposite sides act at the same time, they draw the corners of the mouth outwards, as in laughing; and if one of these muscles only be thrown into action, the corner of that side of the mouth is drawn upwards. The lesser zygomatic muscle is frequently awanting. Super-Maxillo-Labialis Major et Medius, or the Levator Labii Superioris Alaque Nasi. This muscle arises from the nasal process of the upper jaw, and descends along the groove for the lacrymal sac, and from the external part of the orbitar process of the same bone, which forms the lower part of the orbit immediately above the passage for the infra-orbitar artery, vein and nerve. The muscle is fixed into the Ala Nasi, where it is united wnth the Compressor Narium, and into the upper lip. This muscle raises the upper lip, and the ala nasi, and thereby dilates the nostril- The Super-Maxillo-Labialis Minor, or the Levator Anguli Oris. This muscle is covered by the preceding. It arises from

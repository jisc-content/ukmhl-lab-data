OF THE MALE AND FEMALE SKULL. 197 The superciliary ridges do not form so prominent a feature of the female skull, and, according to some authors, the sagit- tal suture is more frequently continued down to the root of the nose. It is a remarkable circumstance that the above distinctions in the conformation of the skull are distinguishable, according to Scemmeking, in very early life. He has observed, in the text which accompanies his very beautiful engravings of the foetus, “ Embryonis enim masculini caput, ratione corporis reliqui habita, in universum amplius, at minus rotundatum videtur foeminino, occiput praeterea plerumque elatum, gibbum quasi prominet, vertex capitis simul paululum complanatus, cervix autem nonnihil sinuata. Embryonis vero foeminini ca- put, in universum minus amplum, magis rotundatum vero videtur, occiput praeterea plerumque vix elatum, vertex simul sphaericus, cervix minus sinuata quam in masculinis. Hinc etiam puellis formosioribus adultis cervix minus sinuata esse solet.” SECTION II. Of the Distinctions in the Form of the Skull of Different Nations. Few subjects relating to structure alone can be considered as more deserving of attention, than an investigation into the national peculiarities as to the conformation of the human head, and hence it is not to be wondered that this department of natural history has in all ages attracted much notice. The science of physiognomy, in whatsoever light it may be regarded, is intimately connected with anatomy. La- vater considered the knowledge of the conformation of the skull as the basis of this science. The skull indicates to a certain degree the size and form of the softer parts which cover it, and, on the other hand, the softer parts imprint the harder. The small head of the Negro, his large and coarse features, his prominent cheeks, flat and wide nose, large mouth, and prominent large teeth, correspond with the peculiar form and size of his skull; while, on the other hand, the larger era-

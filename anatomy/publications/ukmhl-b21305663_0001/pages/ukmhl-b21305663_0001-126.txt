80 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. wedged in between the ossa innominata ; and, when de- pressed by the weight of the body, forces together the ossa innominata at the symphysis pubis, and renders the bond of union between them still more intimate. A certain proportion of ligament enters into the construc- tion of the pelvis ; thus sufficient space is given for the origin and insertion of the requisite number of muscles; the weight is not increased, and the bad effects of shocks which the body otherwise must have sustained whilst violently agitated, as in dancing, leaping, running, or descending from a height, are averted. The pelvis has been divided into three parts, the brim or introitus, the cavity, and the inferior aperture or exitus. The true, or lower, pelvis has been said to be composed of a cavity, and of an upper and under aperture. The line extending backwards fromjf the ossa pubis to the ossa ilia, is the line which marks the upper aperture of the true pelvis, which looks upwards and forwards in the erect position, but the inferior aperture, which is much contracted by muscles, and by ligaments extended between the os sacrum, ossa coccygis, and ossa ischia, looks downwards and back- wards. Of the Axis of the Pelvis. The axis of the pelvis varies much in the different attitudes of the body, and even in the same attitude at different periods of life. In the erect position, the line of the axis of the upper aper- ture of the pelvis, extending between the navel and the extre- mity of the ossa coccygis, forms a considerable angle with the line of gravity of the body; and hence the bowels of the pelvis are well supported : owing, also, to the oblique posi- tion of the pelvis in the erect posture, and from the peculiar position of the thigh bones in respect to it, the line of support corresponds with that of the lower extremities. The axis of the inferior aperture, is nearly in a line with that of the vagina, and forms a considerable angle with that

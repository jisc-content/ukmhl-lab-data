MUSCLES OF THE CHEEKS AND LIPS. 383 MuscLâ€™s of the Checks and Lips. There are ten muscles which are proper to the lips and cheeks. These muscles in the human body, are capable of a greater variety of action than in brutes. The carnivorous animal has muscles for shewing its teeth, and for raising that part of the upper-lip which covers the canine teeth; but, in a graminivorous animal, the lips are fixed down on the fore-part of the gums, where only that part of the lips which is over the front teeth can be elevated; hence the difference of expression of a graminivorous and car- nivorous animal; the former shews his teeth, the latter snorts. The muscles of the human face are susceptible of the action of carnivorous and graminivorous animals. The muscles of the human face are disposed in pairs, so that the action of the one side counterpoises that of the other ; hence, when one side loses its power, as in palsy, the corner of the mouth is drawn up. The greater number of muscles of the human face are fixed to the inner corner of the eye- brow, or inner corner of mouth, which, therefore, are the most expressive parts of the human countenance. The Labialis, or Orbicularis Oris. This muscle lies immediately below the skin, and between its fibres there is a good deal of fat. The fibres of this muscle, which are small, decussate each other at the corners of the mouth ; so that this muscle seems to consist of two semicircular muscles; and they arise from the several muscles which are united at the corner of the mouth. The outer part of the muscle is formed of the fibres of all the Levatores Labii Superioris and Zygomatici; but the fibres of the several muscles are so intermixed with each other, that it is impossible to distinguish the one from the other. The interrial fibres form the true Sphincter Oris. This muscle shuts the mouth: it brings the lips into con- tact with each other, or with any substance put into the mouth.

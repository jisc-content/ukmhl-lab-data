PREFACE. xl In treating of the Lymphatic System, many obser- vations respecting its origin, course, termination, and more particular structure and functions are premised, as being introductory to the description of the parti- cular branches of this system. Part VIII. treats of the Gravid Womb, and its contents. To this part some important additions have been made, which were suggested to me by my colleague Professor Hamilton and by Dr Reid ; and I have not omitted to make mention of the dis- coveries of Sir E. Home as to the foetus in utero. From the above very rapid sketch of the contents of the several parts of these volumes, the reader may, I trust, be persuaded that I have bestowed much pains in collecting the best materials; so that this work may include all the most modern improvements in the sciences of which it treats. I have thus filled up the Outline of the Anatomy of the Body in its sound state, but have not even given an Outline of Morbid Anatomy, but only such remarks as arise out of the Sound Anatomy, which necessarily led to notices regarding the greater num- ber of the Operations of Surgery, of which no men- tion has been made in my former work. To conclude; if these volumes shall fulfil the inten- tions of their author, and prove useful to the student of that science which is the only solid basis of Phy- siology, Pathology, and Surgery, he will consider himself fully compensated for the time and labour lie has bestowed in their composition.

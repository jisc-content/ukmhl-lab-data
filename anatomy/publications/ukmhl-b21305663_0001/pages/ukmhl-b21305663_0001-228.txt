182 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. CHAP. XI. OF THE CAUSES WHICH DETERMINE THE SIZE AND FORM OF THE SKULL, AND OF THOSE CAUSES WHICH LEAD TO AN ALTERATION OF ITS SHAPE. The cavity of the cranium is proportioned to its contents ; and hence there is much variety as to the size of the head, and also as to its form, in different subjects. It is neither so broad nor so deep at its fore part, in which the fore part of the brain is lodged, as at its back part, in which the back part of the brain and smaller brain are lodged. The greatest diameter of the cranium, is from the fore-head to the hind-head, and is equal in the adult to somewhat more than six inches: the greatest transverse diameter is generally between four and five inches and a half; and the greatest perpendicular is from the vertex to the foramen magnum oc- cipitis. Dr Milligan, in the Notes to his valuable translation of Majendie’s Physiology, has made the following remarks on the size of the skull at different periods of life. “ The mean greatest length of the skull is 6/29s, breadth 5^%% accord- ing to Dr Monro’s measurement of Adults, Out. I. 351. Hatters add the two diameters together and take their arith- metical mean for the diameter of hats, which surround and measure the external visible circumference of the head. As the number of heads they measure is immense, and they themselves are void of all theory, the following table obtained from an eminent manufacturer, and exhibiting the mean dia- meters of the “ external head” at the different ages, may as- sist us in comparing the growth of the brain with that of the head.

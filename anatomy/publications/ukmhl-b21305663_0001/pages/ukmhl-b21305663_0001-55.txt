GENERAL OBSERVATIONS. 9 ed oils, being- insoluble in water and alkohol; and leave a greasy stain on paper. Oils are found in animals under the form of fat, called tallow in quadrupeds, butter, spermaceti, ambergris; hence some of the oily substances are solid, others liquid ; some are white, others coloured. There are also different earths, metals, inflammable sub- stances, alkalies, acids, contained in the different substances, which are generated within the bodies of animals. lsf, Lime forms a considerable share of the bones and shells of animals, and also of the other parts ; it is never found pure, but always in a state of combination with the carbonic or phos- phoric acids. 2d, Magnesia occurs but rarely, and in very small quantities, in urine, combined with the phosphoric acid; also in some bones. 3d, Silica is found in a few parts of the animal frame; as in hair and urine, and urinary concretions. 4th, Iron has been said, by some distinguished chemists, to form the colouring principle of the blood, bile and milk ; in the latter it is in a state of phosphate. 5th, Manganese, in the form of oxide, has been detected in the ashes of hair, by Vauquelin. 6th, Sulphur is found in a combined, but not in a simple state; it is united with oxygen, forming the sulphuric acid; it is combined with potash, and soda, and lime. 1th, Phosphorus is often combined with oxygen in the state of phosphoric acid, in many of the solids and fluids of ani- mals ; and the phosphoric acid is found combined with lime, ammonia, potash, and soda. 3th, Potash is found combined with the sulphuric, muriatic, and phosphoric acids, in small quantities. 9th, Soda exists in all the fluids in different states of com- bination. It is found combined with the carbonic, phosphoric, sulphuric, and muriatic acids. \{)th, Ammonia is a frequent product of putrefaction.

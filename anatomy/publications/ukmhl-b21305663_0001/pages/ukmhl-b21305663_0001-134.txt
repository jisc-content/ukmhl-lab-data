88 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. drawn from the articulations of the ossa innominata with the sacrum to the symphysis pubis, are now raised from oblique to more perpendicular situations.” It may also be observed, that the convex back part of the os occipitis of the child may pass down in the opening be- tween the ossa pubis; and, as the head of a child at birth can be altered in its shape, that a still greater portion of the head may pass down in that opening, than if the head had been quite rigid. This operation will therefore be of use where a small addi- tion to the distance between the ossa pubis and sacrum will be sufficient for the delivery of the child. It will be of still greater use, if the obstruction to delivery be owing to the smallness of the space between the ossa ischia, at the lower part of the pelvis, as the distance between these and also between the opposite sides of the pelvis at the extremities of the transverse diameter of its upper part, may be increased to one-half of the distance between the divided ossa pubis. Hut if the bones are so distorted as to straiten the passage much (which ought to be examined), this operation will be of little or no use; and, by it, the life of the mother will be en- dangered, without saving that of the child. The effects of this operation have been exaggerated, from its having been done where the pelvis was little, or not at all contracted. Thus in one of the first cases, operated by Le Roy, in 1777, and which has been generally quoted, as giving great encouragement to the performance of this operation, the woman had formerly been delivered of a full grown living child, from which I think we may conclude, either that the operation had been unnecessarily performed, or that a very small addition to the width of the pelvis was sufficient. From the nature of the operation, and from the accounts we can col- Ject of its success, the danger following it must be greatly less than that of the Caesarean operation; but, as yet, the cases nre not so numerous as to enable us to determine the degree of danger with much accuracy • The above observations on Sigault’s operation, are taken from my Fa- ther’s Lectures.

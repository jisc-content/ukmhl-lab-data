ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 460 Femori-Calcaneus, or the Plantaris. This muscle arises from the upper and back-part of the ex- ternal condyle of the thigh-bone, and from the capsular liga- ment of the joint; and it is concealed by the outer head of the gastrocnemius. The belly of this muscle is not above three or four inches long. From this muscle, a thin tendon descends between the inner heads of the gastrocnemii muscles, which is fixed into the in- ner edge of the tendo Achillis, and into the posterior part of the os calcls. This muscle is sometimes awanting. SECTION XXII. MUSCLES OF THE TOES. There are extensor, flexor, abductor and adductor muscles proper to the toes. The extensor muscles of the toes are three in number; viz. Peroneo-Super-Unguialis, or the Extensor Longus Digito- â€œ rum Pedis. This muscle, which lies under the tendinous fascia, and between the tibialis anticus and peroneus longus, to both of which it is connected by many tendinous fibres, takes its rise from the outer part of the head of the tibia, from the fibula, and from the interosseous ligament. Below the middle of the leg, it splits into four tendons, which in their course pass un- der the annular ligament at the ankle joint, are inserted into the root of the first phalanx of each of the four small toes, and are expanded over the upper side of the toes, as far as the last phalanx. Calcaneo-Super-Unguialis, or Extensor Brevis Digitorum Pedis. The belly of this muscle, which lies under the tendons of the extensor longus digitorum pedis and peroneus brevis,

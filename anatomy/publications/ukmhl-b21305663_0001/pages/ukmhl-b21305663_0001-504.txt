Of the Muscles which arise from the Perone, or Fibula. Peroneo-Tarseus, or Peroneus Longus. This muscle is placed between the outer part of the exten- sor longus digitorum pedis, and the edge of the soleus; it arises from the fore-part of the head of the fibula, and from the outer-part of the same bone. The muscular fibres are fixed obliquely into the tendon, like the plumage of a pen into its stalk. The tendon of this muscle is lodged in a groove, formed by the malleolus exter- nus; it passes across the sole of the foot in a groove in the cuboid bone, and is fixed into the outside of the metatarsal bone of the great toe and os cuneifonne internum. By this muscle the foot is extended, and the inner edge of it turned downwards. Peroneo-Metcitarseus Magnus, or Peroneus Brevis. This muscle takes its rise between the extensor longus di- gitorum pedis and peroneus longus, and from the outer part of the fibula: the fibres are fixed obliquely into the tendon which passes behind the outer ankle, in the same sheath with the preceding muscle, and is fixed into the external part of the metatarsal bone of the little toe. The use of this muscle is to pull the outer edge of the foot upwards. Some authors have described a Peroneus tertius, but that muscle I consider as a part of the extensor longus digitorum. By the weight of the body, the leg is bent forwards on the foot; to obviate which there are three very powerful exten- sor muscles, which compose the calf of the leg, and which act upon the foot bv the medium of the tendo Achillis.

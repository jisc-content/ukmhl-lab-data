ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 440 lay hold of’ very minute substances, in which we are assisted by our nails. Radio-Sub- Unguialis, or Flexor Longus Pollicis Manus. This muscle is concealed by the flexor digitorum sublimis : it arises from the fore-part of the radius, and, from the in- terosseous ligament, passes under the annular ligament, and is fixed by a tendon which passes between the two sesamoid bones *, which are placed in the fore-part of the joint of the thumb, into the last joint of the thumb; which is bent by it. Carpo-Plialangeus, or Flexor Brevis Pollicis. This muscle arises from the os trapezoides, os magnum, and os unciforme; it lies under the abductor pollicis; it is divided into two portions by the flexor longus, and is fixed into the base of the first bone of the thumb and ossa sesamoi- dea : by this muscle the first joint of the thumb is bent. Carpo-Metacarpalis, or Opponens Pollicis. This muscle, which lies under the abductor pollicis, takes its origin from the os trapezium, and ligamentum carpi an- nulare, and is inserted into the under and fore part of the metacarpal bone of the thumb. This muscle brings the thumb inwards, and makes it oppose the fingers. Carpo-Super-Phalangeus, or Abductor Pollicis. This muscle is placed under the skin, and is the outermost portion of the mass which forms the ball of the thumb; it arises from the os trapezium and ligamentum carpi annulare, and is fixed into the outer side of the root of the first bone of the thumb. The use of the muscle is to draw the thumb from the fingers. Metacarpo-Phalangeus-PoUicis, or Adductor Pollicis. This muscle takes its origin from the metacarpal bone of • Sesamoid Bones are sometimes found in the articulations between the me- tacarpus and fingers.

OF CARTILAGE. 301 CIIAP. I. OF CARTILAGE. SECTION I. GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON CARTILAGE. Cartilage may be distinguished from other animal sub- stances, by its grey pearly or opal-like colour,—by the re- markable smoothness of its surface,—by its elasticity,—by its semi-pellucidity,—and by being much lighter than bone. There is a slight difference in the colour of the cartilages at different periods of life. In early life, it is more of a grey colour than in advanced life. Cartilage, when dried, becomes nearly transparent, and very brittle; when put into boiling water, it becomes more opaque, and shrinks. On account of the small size of the fibres of cartilage, it is very difficult to trace their course. The cartilages, when macerated for some time in water, exhibit a fibrous structure. Cartilage forms a considerable share of those organs where it is necessary to combine flexi- bility with a certain degree of firmness, in order that the part may always preserve a certain form. Cartilages are covered by a membrane called Perichon- drium, which is somewhat similar in its office to the perios- teum ; serving to conduct the small vessels which enter into the substance of the cartilages. The bloodvessels, nerves, and absorbent vessels of carti- lage are so small as to elude observation ; hut there cannot he a doubt of their existence, of which there is the clearest evi-

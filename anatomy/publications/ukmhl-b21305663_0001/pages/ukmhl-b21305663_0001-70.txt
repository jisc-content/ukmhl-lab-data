ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 24 the muscles, or lor giving passage to their tendons; thus the extent of the surface of the bone is increased, though not its bulk. The cavities allow the heads of bones to play in them; lodge and defend other parts; and afford safe passage to ves- sels, muscles, &c. Of the Colour of the Bones. The colour of the bones depends upon the age, sex, consti- tution, food, the manner in which they have been prepared, and the disease which proved fatal to the animal. The dry bones of the adult, generally speaking, are of a light straw-colour, whereas fresh bones have more of a bluish tint; owing to the number of bloodvessels which enter into their composition. The bones of animals that contain much oil, as those of the whale, are of a yellow colour ; whereas the bones of dropsical persons, from which the oil and part of the marrow have been absorbed, and of those birds that are filled with air, are nearly white. The bones of infants have a purplish tint, owing to the number of bloodvessels proper to them. The bones of the Negro are whiter than those of the Eu- ropean. It is well known to anatomists, that bones which have been repeatedly washed by sea-water, and then exposed to the sun, are the whitest. There are some substances which communicate to the bones of living animals peculiar colours. The Rubia tinctorum, or madder, and extract of logwood, given along with the food of the animal, alter the natnral colour of the bones : the former renders bones of a crimson colour, owing, as my late ingenious colleague Dr Rutherford discovered, to an elective attrac- tion between the phosphate of lime of the bones, and the colour- ing principle of the madder *; and the latter gives them a pur- plish tint. * Vide Blakeâ€™s Thesis de Dentibus, p. 119. ct scq.

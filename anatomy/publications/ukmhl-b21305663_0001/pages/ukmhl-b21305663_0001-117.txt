OF THE VERTEBRAE. 71 side; but is prevented from moving backwards and forwards, bv its anterior arch, and by the cross ligament, whicli are both closelv applied to the tooth-like process. Motion for- wards here would have been dangerous, for thus the begin- ning of the spinal marrow must have been brought into con- tact with the point of the tooth-like process. By the rotatory motion of the head, objects are readily and quickly presented to the organs of senses. The lateral or moderator ligaments confine so much the motion of the first vertebra upon the second, that, though this joint may serve us on several occasions, yet we are often ob- liged to turn our faces farther round, than could be done by this joint alone, without the greatest danger of twisting the spinal marrow too much, and also of luxating the oblique process ; therefore, on turning the head in a greater degree, all the vertebrae of the neck and loins also are rotated. The seventh â€¢ vertebra of the neck resembles inform those of the back, having the upper and lower surfaces of its body less hollow than the others : The oblique processes are more perpendicular; neither spinal nor transverse processes are forked. The transverse process of the sixth and seventh cervical vertebra, are more frequently divided by a small cross bridge, that intervenes between the cervical vein and artery, than in any of the other vertebrae. Dorsal Vertebra. The distinguishing characters of the twelve dorsal vertebrae, are, their being of a middle size between the cervical and lumbar vertebrae, prominent in front, flattened on their sides, for their articulation with the ribs, and being horizontal as to their upper and under surfaces. The cartilages interposed between the bodies of these verte- bra* are thinner than in any other of the true vertebra; and contribute to the concavity of the spine in the thorax, by be- ing thinnest at their fore part.

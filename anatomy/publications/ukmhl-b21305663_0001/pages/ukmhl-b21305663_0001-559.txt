513 OF THE ABDOMEN. CHAP. III. OF THE ORGANS OF CHYMIFICATION AND CHYLI- FICATION. SECTION I. OF THE REGIONS OF THE ABDOMEN AND OF THE PERITON/EUM. The abdomen is that part of the body situated between the chest and pelvis. It has commonly been described as the largest cavity of the body *, and its dimensions are occasion- ally augmented by the distention of the bowels proper to it. The abdomen is bounded behind by the spine and muscles of the loins; and at its sides and in front, by muscles, which therefore have been called Abdominal Muscles. Above, it is bounded by the muscle, called Diaphragm ; and below, by the bony circle which forms the upper aperture of the pelvis. In order to describe more accurately the situation of the different bowels of the abdomen, anatomists have divided it into certain regions or compartments, by lines drawn artificial- ly across it. They draw one line from the cartilage of the eighth rib of one side, to the cartilage of the same rib of the opposite side ; the space above the middle of which line, viz. in the angle made by the meeting of the cartilages of the ribs with the sternum, has been called the Epigastric Region; and the spaces on each side of that region the Hypochondriac Region. They draw another line across the under part of the belly, between the anterior spinous processes of the ossa innominata. â€¢ I have not used the word cavity, because there is no cavity of the abdomen; for the parietes of the abdomen, and their contents, are in immediate contact, and constantly act and react upon each other, VOL.

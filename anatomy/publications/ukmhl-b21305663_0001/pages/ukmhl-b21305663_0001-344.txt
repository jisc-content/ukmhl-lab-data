298 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. semicircle, resembling the body of the os hyoides. Next, by insinuating the finger and thumb between the margin of the sterno-mastoid muscles, we feel, just a little below the cricoid cartilage, a substance of a doughy consistence; but in the living subject, and in the healthy state of parts, its limits are by no means well defined. It is produced by, and marks the position of, the thyroid gland. Between the sterno-mastoid muscles, and below the thyroid gland, a hollow is felt, angu- lar in its figure, containing the trachea: The point where we enter the windpipe, in performing the operation of tracheo- tomy. â€œ All these parts can be easily distinguished on the living body, and, consequently, the relation of the one to the other may be ascertained. In a full grown male, six finger-breadths will generally be found between the upper margin of the thy- roid cartilage and the sternum. By dividing this into two equal portions, we define the superior border of the thyroid gland, and by allowing a single breadth of the finger, for the average breadth of the gland itself, a space capable of admit- ting two fingers is alone left below the gland and above the sternum Surgical Anatomy of the Head and Neck, p. 65, 66.

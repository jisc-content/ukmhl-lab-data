OF THE OS UNCIFOltME. 259 tiler form the eavitv for receiving it. On the inside, a short plain surface joins the os magnum to the trapezoicles. On the outside, there is a long narrow concave surface, where it is contiguous to the os unciforme. The lower end, which sustains the metacarpal bone of the middle finger, is triangular., slightly hollowed, and more pro- minent on the internal side than on the external, having a con- siderable oblong depression made on the advanced inside by the metacarpal bone of the fore-finger ; and generally there is a small mark of the os metacarpi digiti annularis on its ex- ternal side. Of the Os Unciforme. The Os Unciforme is named from a thin broad pro- cess that projects into the palm, and is hollow on its in- side, for the passage of the tendons of the flexors of the fingers, and to this process also the transverse ligament is fixed, that binds down and defends these tendons. The flexor and abductor muscles of the little finger have part of their origin from it. The upper plain surface is small, convex, and joined with the os lunare. The internal side is long, and slightly convex, adapted to the contiguous os magnum. The external surface is oblique, and irregularly convex, to be articulated with the cuneiform bone. The lower end is divided into two concave surfaces; the external is joined to the metacarpal bone of the little finger, and the internal one to the metacarpal bone of the ring- finger. In the description of the preceding eight bones, I have mentioned only those plain surfaces covered with cartilage, by which they are articulated to each other, or to other bones. For the sake of additional strength, the surfaces of these bones are convex behind, and concave before ; which concavity is increased by the os pisiforme, and the prominent processes of the os unciforme, and the trapezium : And these bones are bound together by a broad strong transverse ligament, which r 2

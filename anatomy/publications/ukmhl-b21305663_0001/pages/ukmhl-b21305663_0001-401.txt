355 CONTRACTION OF MUSCLES. I propose to adopt both plans, viz. to name the muscles as they present upon dissection, and then to arrange them into classes, according to their several uses. Contraction of Muscles. There are many striking instances of a powerful muscular action in the smaller animals, particularly in insects, in which the apparatus subservient to that purpose is not obvious to our imperfect senses. The muscles are extremely irritable, and contract when irritated, and this irritability is various in the different muscles. A power of contraction is the most characteristic proper- ty of a muscle. Sir Everard Home * says, the princi- ple of contraction is independent of the organization, since it (a muscle) can undergo a complete change within itself; so that its fibres shall be shortened to one-half of their origi- nal length, and still have the same contractile power as in the original state. This is proved by a case of a fractured knee- pan, where the pieces were not closely united. He desired the patient to sit on a table; and the extensor muscles of the leg, which at first were not under the dominion of the will, became so in time; so that a new action took place. The same was proved by a case where a humerus was broken, and the broken ends crossed each other, and adhered in that situa- tion ; the biceps shortened itself, and acquired power of con- traction. The whole of a muscle, or only a part of it, contracts itself upon the application of a stimulus. It acts only by contrac- tions; and, when the exertion ceases, it relaxes itself consi- derably. When a muscle contracts, the belly of the muscle becomes hard, its parts are drawn more closely together; it becomes rough on its surface and swells; its smaller fibres as- sume a waved or zig-zag appearance, and its extremities ap- proach each other ; the muscle, in consequence of this action, draws the least moveable towards the more fixed part, to which â€¢ Lect. on Comp, Anat.

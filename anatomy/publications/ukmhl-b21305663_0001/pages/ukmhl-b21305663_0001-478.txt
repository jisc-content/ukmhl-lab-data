432 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. The anterior portion proceeds obliquely backwards ; the mid- dle, which covers the hall of the os humeri, is in its descent nearly straight, and the posterior portion of the muscle passes obliquely forwards. When the arm is hanging by the side, it is raised by the deltoid to a right angle with the body, and it is thrown forwards or backwards, according as the anterior or posterior portions of the muscle are brought into action : when the arm has been raised, if the anterior part acts, the arm is thrown forwards; and, if the posterior portion be brought into action, the arm is drawn downwards and back- wards. Coraco-Humeralis, or Coraco-Brachialis. This muscle arises, in common with the short head of the biceps muscle, from the fore-part of the coracoid process of the scapula; it is placed behind the biceps muscle, and is con- cealed by the greater pectoral and deltoid muscles, and is fixed into the middle of the humerus, below the insertion of the latissimus dorsi and teres major muscles. It is used to raise the arm obliquely forwards. SECTION XL MUSCLES OF THE FORE-ARM. There are two flexors, and only one extensor of the fore- arm. Of the Flexor Muscles. Scapulo-Radialis, or Biceps Flexor Cubiti. This muscle has two origins, one in common with the co- raco-brachialis, from the coracoid process of the scapula, and the other, the longer, from the upper part of the glenoid ca- vity : the longer head passes over the ball of the os humeri within the joint : it is retained by a ligament within a groove in the upper-part of the os humeri, and is fixed by a strong round tendon, which is placed between the supinator

450 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. Ischii- Trochantcri, or Gemini. These muscles, which lie below the pyriform muscle, and above the quadratus femoris, take their origins from the pos- terior edge of the ischium, and are inserted into the top of the great trochanter. They are united by a tendinous sheath ; and, between them, the tendon of the obturator interims plays. % Ischio-Trochanterus, or Quadratus Femoris. This muscle, which is placed under the preceding, extends between the tuberosity of the os ischium, and posterior edge of the great trochanter, and rotates the thigh from within out- wardly. This muscle is concealed by the gluUeus maximus; and lies under the inferior gemellus muscle. SECTION XIX. THE MUSCLES INSERTED INTO THE TROCHANTER MINOR, WHICH ARE FLEXORS OF THE THIGH. Prn-Lumbo- Trochanterus, or Psoas Magnus. % This muscle arises from the sides of the transverse processes of the lumbar and last dorsal vertebra; it passes along the brim of the pelvis, and is inserted, by means of a tendon, into the lesser trochanter. In some instances, we meet with a Psoas parvus muscle, which takes its rise from the last dorsal and first lumbar vertebra, and is fixed, by a long slender ten- don, into the bi'im of the pelvis, where the os pubis and os ilium are united. Ilio-Trochantinus, or Iliacus Interims. This muscle, which fills up the concave surface of the os ilium, takes its origin from the transverse process of the lowest lumbar vertebra, and also from the inner surface of the os ilium ; it passes along the brim of the pelvis, and is fixed, alono- with the former muscle, into the lesser trochanter. o , This muscle is covered by a strong fascia, called Fascia Ilia-

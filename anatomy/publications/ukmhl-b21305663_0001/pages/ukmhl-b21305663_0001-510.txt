ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 464 anterior extremity of the metatarsal bone, and root of the first bone of the little toe. This muscle assists in bending the little toe. In the foot there are also two strata of interossei muscles, viz. three interossei interni, placed in the sole of the foot, whicjji move the three lesser toes towards each other. There are four interossei externi, which are larger than the internal, and bicipites, which separate the toes from each other. SECTION XXIII. OF THE BURS.E OF THE INFERIOR EXTREMITIES. The Burstz Mucosx which appear in a fore view of the inferior extremity, are, A very large bursa mucosa between the iliacus internus and psoas muscles, and the capsular ligament of the thigh- bone. There is likewise a bursa between the tendon of the pecti- neus and thigh-bone. And also a small bursa mucosa between the glutseus me- dius and trochanter major; and behind it the tendon of the pyriformis is inserted. There is a bursa mucosa between the tendon of the glu- taeus minimus and trochanter major. There is a bursa mucosa between the glutseus maximus and vastus externus. There is a large bursa mucosa behind the tendon of the extensors of the leg. There is a bursa mucosa behind the ligament which joins the patella to the tibia; and a large fatty pelleton hangs down into the cavity of the bursa. There is a large bursa mucosa behind the tendon of the sartorius, and behind the tendons of the gracilis and semi- tendinosus, covering the inner fore part of the tibia. There is a bursa mucosa between the tendon of the tibialis anticus, and under part of the tibia and ligament of the ankle.

261 OF THE METACARPUS. where these bones are contiguous to each other, they are flat, and also behind, for the more easy play of the tendons of the extensor muscle. The anterior surface of these bodies is a little concave, es- pecially in their middle : along which a sharp ridge stands out, which separates the musculi interossei placed on each side of these bones. Their lower ends are oblong, whose greatest extent is forwards from the axis of the bone. At the fore part of each side of the root of each of these heads, there are one or two tubercles, for the ligaments that go from one metacarpal bone to another, and which prevent their disunion. Around the heads, there is a rough ring for the insertion of the capsular ligaments of the first joints of the fingers ; and both sides of these heads are flat, where they press on each other. At the time of birth, these bones are cartilaginous at both ends, which afterwards become epiphyses. The metacarpal bones are joined above to the ossa carpi, and to each other by nearly plain surfaces. The movements of these bones are therefore limited. The metacarpal bones are concave towards the palm of the hand, and their bases form the arch of the carpus. The spaces between them lodge muscles, and their small motion makes them fit supporters for the fingers to play on. The ossa metacarpi may thus be distinguished from each other. The os metacarpi indicis is generally the longest. Its base, which is articulated with the os trapezoides, is hol- low in the middle. The small ridge on the internal side of this oblong cavity is smaller than the one opposite to it, and is made flat on the side by the trapezium. The exterior ridge is also smooth, and fiat on its outside, for its conjunction with the os magnum ; immediately below which there is a semicircular smooth flat surface for the arti- culation of this to the second metacarpal bone. The back part of this base is fiat, where the long head of the

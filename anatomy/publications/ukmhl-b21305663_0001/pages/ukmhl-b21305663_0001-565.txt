OF THE HUMAN STOMACH. 519 gullet then makes with the stomach is very nearly a right angle. The pressure of the distended stomach on the liver and pancreas may occasion a diminished secretion of the bile and pancreatic liquor. It also tends to force out the bile which has been accumulated within the gall-bladder, and the blood that is collected within the bloodvessels of the spleen; and, by its pressure on the diaphragm, occasions a temporary dif- ficulty in breathing, in speaking, and in singing. By the distension of the stomach, the pyloric orifice is con- siderably elevated by the longitudinal muscular fibres passing between these orifices, along the smaller curvature of the stomach, which, at that time, are evidently put upon the stretch. Owing to the peculiar arrangement of rthe muscular strata, the distended stomach has somewhat of a conical figure bent upon itself, so that if it were divided transversely, the cardia would remain with the anterior portion, and the pylorus with the posterior. When the stomach has been moderately distended, it is sometimes observed to be contracted towards its middle, or about half way between the cardia and pylorus, or it is some- what contracted in one or two different places. This contraction of the stomach has been noticed by many anatomists. Mr William Cowper * * * § has described, in his explanation of his thirty-fourth plate, what he has named “ two bund tings in the lower part of the stomach;'1'' and Snei- der and Blasius have mentioned cases in which the stomach has been divided into three sacs.

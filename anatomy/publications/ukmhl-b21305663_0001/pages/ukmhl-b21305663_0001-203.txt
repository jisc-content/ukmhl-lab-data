157 OF THE OS SPHENOIDES. cavities are likewise said * to be extended sometimes as far back as the great foramen of the occipital bone. In other subjects they are not to be found, when the bone is composed of large cells -f\ Some j mention a cavity within the parti- tion of the sinuses ; but it is small. This bone is of a very different thickness, being in some places diaphanous; in others it is of a middle thickness, and its middle back part surpasses the greatest share of the crani- um in thickness. The os sphenoides is joined by its wings to the parietal bones above, to the os fronds and ossa malarum before, to the temporal bones behind; by the fore part of its body and spinous processes, to the frontal and ethmoid bones; by its back part, behind the two sinuses to the occipital, where it looks like a bone with the epiphyses taken off, and, as was formerly observed in the description of the occipital bone, it cannot be separated without violence in adults; to the palate bones, by the ends of the pterygoid processes, and still more by the fore part of the internal plates of the pterygoid processes, and of the sinuses; to the maxillary bones, by the fore part of the external pterygoid plates ; to the vomer and nasal plate of the os ethmoides, by the processus azygos. The sphenoid bone is almost complete in a foetus of nine months; the alae may be separated after maceration from the body of the bone. The processus azygos is very large and hollow ; the thin triangular processes are not ossified; and the sinuses does not appear. Dr Portal has remarked, that he had several times found this bone carious in infants that had died from the small-pox. The temporal wings of this bone have sometimes, though rarely, been broken, as they are covered by the tem- poral muscles, and their aponeuroses. â€¢ Albik. de Os?ib. sect. 39. t Id.

According to Majendie, different kinds of chyle are found within the intestines. The same author has also stated, that he had an opportunity of examining the bodies of two cri- minals who had taken nearly the same kind of food, and in the same quantity; he found the chyme in the pyloric portion of the stomach and in the small intestines exactly similar in all respects. The excrementitious part of the alimentary mass is found within the larger intestines, which, being very capacious, serve as a reservoir, within which the feces are collected, in order to preclude the necessity of their constant evacuation. On account of the great capacity of the larger intestines of some animals, it seems probable that the alimentary mass un- dergoes within these some great and important change, espe- cially in the horse, in which animal they are much more ca- pacious than the stomach. The larger intestines are filled by a yellow feculent sub- stance, which, according to Berzelius, is composed of Water, - 73.3 Vegetable and animal remains, - 7.0 Bile, - - - 0.9 Albumen, - 0.9 Peculiar extractive matter, - - 2.7 Slimy matter, containing resin of the bile, peculiar animal matter, and insoluble residue, - 14.0 100.0 It has been supposed, that the meconium of new bom infants is pure bile. Dr Bouilon Lagrange (in the 259th number of the Annales de Chimie), has stated, that it contains water, hairs, a matter similar to the mucus of the nose; and a proportion of a substance which may be regarded as pure me- conium, and which bears a stronger resemblance to an animal

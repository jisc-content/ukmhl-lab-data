ELEMENTS OE ANATOMY. 18 lly studying the form of the bones of the joints, we may discover what particular motion is performed by that joint; there being an exact relation between the joint and the mus- cles which move it: thus, there is ball and socket for admit- ting of a rotatory motion, and for free motion in every direc- tion ; hinge-joints, where flexion and extension only are ne- cessary : and these joints are more or less secure in different parts of the body; thus, the socket at the hip-joint is much deeper than at the shoulder, as the inferior extremities are subservient not to locomotion only, but also to the support of the body. The spine, which supports the head, consists of twenty- four bones, which move upon each other, and their movements determine the motions of the head and trunk of the body. The head rotates on the second vertebra of the neck, and it is bent and extended on the atlas; but the lateral motion is divided between the whole of the joints of the seven cervical vertebrae. The trunk of the body may be rotated or moved sideways, in which movements all the vertebrae are concerned. The arms possess a greater range of motion than the infe- rior extremities, from the scapula with which they articulated being itself moveable, whereas the thigh bone is connected with the immoveable os innominatum. When the nose is parallel to the breast bone, the face may be turned towards each shoulder through an angle of 60° on each side. In stooping down to touch the ground, the thigh bone forms an angle of about 55° with the spine, when in its usual direction. The leg is bent on the thigh at an angle of 15°. The whole inferior extremity may be moved at the hip joint forwards to nearly a right angle, and backwards to an angle of 20°. The whole arm may be moved forwards or outwards, through a half circle, and backwards to an angle of 40°. The flexion of the fore arm on the humerus is an angle of nearly 40°

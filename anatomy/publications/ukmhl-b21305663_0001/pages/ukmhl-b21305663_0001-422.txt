376 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. c2d, Between bone and ligaments,—as between the acro- mion and ligaments of the humerus. 3d, Between tendon and ligament,—as between the ten- don of the psoas, iliacus internus and ligament of the hip- joint. 4th, Between two tendons,—as between the tendons of the extensores carpi, longior and brevior. 5th, Between tendon and its sheath,—as within the sheaths of the tendons of the fingers and toes. 6th, Between tendon and cartilage,—as between the ten- don of the superior oblique muscle of the eye, and its carti- laginous pulley. 7th, Between tendon and bone,—as between the tendon of the scapulo-radialis mnscle and radius, &c. The bursae are larger in the extremities than in the trunk of the body, and are either of a rounded or oval shape, or somewhat like purses, including the sheaths of the tendons : hence the bursae have been arranged under two great classes, the Spherical and the Vaginal B*ursce. The proper membranes of the bursae, though remarkably thin, are capable of confining fluids, and even air; and, ac- cording to my Father, ai’e in structure similar to the internal layer of the capsular ligaments of the joints, to the pleura, periosteum, and other serous membranes, and consequently, subject to the same organic derangements *. The membranes of the bursae are united to the neighbour- ing parts by the common cellular membrane, and where si- tuated in the vicinity of the bones, a thin layer of cartilage is interposed between the bursa and the bone. The membrane of the bursa is internally remarkably smooth, and lubricated by a fluid in all respects similar to synovia, and there are very small masses of fat within the bursa, with fringes appended to them, which are covered by the continuation of the membrane of the bursa, and upon which the smaller ramifications of the arteries are distributed In this observation he has anticipated Bichat.

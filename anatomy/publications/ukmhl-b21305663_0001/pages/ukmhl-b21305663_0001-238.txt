In the former, from the boy sleeping most frequently on his back, the back part of the head on which he lests had become flat: and as, in the latter case, the child wa& suckled at one breast only, the pressure of the motherâ€™s arm prevented the one side from bulging out so much as the other. It is obvious, that where the internal pressure is greatly in- creased, and the bones of the skull give way, this enlarge- ment must be unequal, owing to the unequal resistance of the skull. As the chief circumstances, upon which this unequal resist- ance depends, in my opinion, are the progress of ossification,, and the connection of the different bones of the head, I shall now proceed to explain the effect of these more fully. From the imperfect ossification of the bones of the head, when the child is born, it follows, that when die disease origi- nates while the foetus is in utero, the skull must more readily give way, and more readily acquire a large size, than when the disease occurs at a later period of life, and where the bones of the skull are burst asunder, after having been pre- viously united. The form of the skull of the foetus is very different from that of the adult: in the former, the skull projects remark- ably at the original centres of ossification of its component pieces, and hence the upper part of the skull of the foetus is not so round as that of the adult. In the adult, those prominences which are very apparent in the foetus disappear, owing to the gradual growth and alter- ation of the shape of the brain, which serves as a mould on which the skull is formed; the skull adapting itself to the form of the brain. But as, in consequence of hydrocephalus, the growth of the brain is checked, or in some measure suspended, the brain does not acquire its usual form ; and as the brain is pushed outwards from the accumulation of water within it, the bones of the cranium, though they increase in size, retain the form they had when the child was born, and the ossific spiculae, in- stead of describing portions of spheres, as they do at a later

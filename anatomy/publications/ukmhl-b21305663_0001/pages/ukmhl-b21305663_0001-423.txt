OF THE BUllS^E MUCOSAE. 377 in considerable number, which thereby communicate to it a pale red colour. Lymphatic Vessels. Lymphatic vessels certainly are proper to the bursae, but they are so small as to elude observation. If the bursae mucosae had not been provided with lym- phatic vessels, they must have been much distended, and at length ruptured by the quantity of fluid accumulated within them. 2d, Fluids of different descriptions, which are occasionally collected within the bursae, have been sometimes resumed. Nerves. On account of the extreme thinness of the coats of the bursae mucosae, the anatomist cannot give ocular proof of nerves being distributed upon their coats, which has given rise to the opinion, that the bursae mucosae are not supplied with nerves, which opinion, as the bursae are endowed with little sensibility, has gained weight. But as an inflammation of the bursae occasions great pain, there can be no doubt of' their being under the influence of nerves. Authors upon the Bur see Mucosae. Winslow, Exposit.

426 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. The tendinous aponeurosis is thicker on the outer than on the inner side of the arm: it is thicker on the fore-arm than on the humerus, and at the wrist, the fibres of it are thicker, and are said to form the annular ligaments. The superficial veins of the arm are disposed between the skin and the tendinous aponeurosis: also the branches of the superficial nerves, and many lymphatic vessels. There is a strong fascia in the fore-arm, as in the leg. The fascia is attached to the condyles of the humerus, and to the olecranon ulnae : it is stronger on the back than on the fore part of the arm, in consequence of the addition of tendinous fibres from the triceps extensor muscle: and the tendinous aponeurosis of the fore part of the arm is rendered stronger by the addition of tendons from the scapulo-radialis muscle. This fascia sends processes between the muscles of the fore arm, which have been named by some authors inter- muscular ligaments, from which many tendinous muscular fibres take their origin. At the wrist there are two annular ligaments; the liga- mentum carpi annulare posterius, under which the tendons of the extensor muscles pass, which extends transversely be- tween the styloid process of the ulna, and os pisiforme, and is fixed to the styloid process of the ulna; and the ligamen- tum carpi anterius, which passes across the fore part of the wrist, extends between the os pisiforme and os unciforme, and the os scaphoides, and under this the tendons of the flexor muscles pass to the hand. In the palm of the hand, there is a strong fascia, which is connected with the tendon of the palmaris longus, and which covers the greater share of the palm of the hand, and is fixed to the roots of the fingers by an equal number of double slips of tendon. There are two muscles proper to the tendinous aponeurosis of the superior extremity, the Epitrochlo-Palmaris, or Pal- maris Longus, and the Palmaro-Cutaneus, or Palmaris Brevis.

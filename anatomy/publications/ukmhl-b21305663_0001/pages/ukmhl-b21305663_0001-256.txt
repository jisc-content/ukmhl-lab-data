Other characters consist in the great size, thickness and prominence of the bones of the face, which seem to have been impressed by large muscles ; the prominence of the alveolar processes, and consequent obliquity of the facial line; the oblique direc- tion of the large incisor teeth; the great breadth and height of the zygomatic processes, indicating the large size of the temporal muscle ; the retreating chin, as in the monkey tribe ; the great size of the cavity of the nose; and the foramen magnum ossis occipitis, being larger and placed further back than in the European skull *. The African is still farther marked by greater size and thickness of the under jaw-bone, and the greater size and breadth of the teeth, which are more solid and hard, which is, perhaps, the cause why the Negro is not so liable as the European to caries of the teeth. The facial angle is between 60° and 70°. In short, the seat of the intellectual organs is much smaller in the Negro than in the European skull; but that of the or- gans of smell and tasting is much more capacious. All travel- lers agree as to the inferiority of the mental powers of the Ne- gro. According to Mungo Park, an intelligent black man, who had witnessed the knowledge and skill of some Europe- ans, exclaimed, “ Black men are nothing.” My friend Dr Knox, who resided for some years in South- ern Africa, has been so polite as to draw out for me the fol- lowing very interesting account of the Koff‘res, Bosses mans, and Hottentots.

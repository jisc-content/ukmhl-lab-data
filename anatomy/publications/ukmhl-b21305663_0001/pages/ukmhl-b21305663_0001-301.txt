255 or THE HAND. motions are assisted by the ulna, which can move with a kind of small rotation on the sloping sides of the pully. This lateral motion, though very inconsiderable in the joint itself, is conspi- cuous at the lower end of such a long bone ; and the strong li- gament connecting this lower end to the carpus, makes the hand more readily obey these motions. When we wish to move the hand in a circular manner, we increase it by the ro- tation of the os humeri; and we sometimes employ the spine and inferior extremities to make these motions of prona- tion or supination of the hand still more extensive. According to Sir Astley Coopek, there are five species of dislocation of the elbow-joint. 1 st, Both bones are dislocated backwards. 2d, Both are dislocated laterally. 3d, The ulna is dislocated separately from the radius. 4th, The radius alone is dislocated forwards. 5th, The radius is dislocated backwards. The first of these is by far the most frequent.1 The dislocations at the joint of the wrist, according to the same author, are of three kinds : Istf, Dislocation of both bones, which are thrown either backwards or forwards, accord- ing to the direction in which the force is applied. 2d, Dislo- cation of the radius only ; the bone being thrown on the fore- part of the carpus. 3d, Dislocation of the ulna. Of the Hand. There is a great difference in the size of the hands of the male and female, and also even in the same sex in different nations; those of the Chinese and Esquimaux are small. The hand is concave in front, for the more conveniently hold- ing different bodies, and convex behind, for the sake of strength. The one-half of the hand is less moveable than the other,, and is a sort of base for the other half, which may be extend- ed backwards very little farther than to a straight line with the fore-arm, but can be considerably bent forwards. The hand has been divided into the carpus, metacarpus, and fingers ; among which last the thumb is reckoned.

462 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. are fixed to the tendons of the flexor profundus, the inside of the first joint of the four small toes, and the tendinous expan- sion which is derived from the extensor muscles which cover the upper part of the toes. These muscles increase the extent of the flexion of the toes. Calcaneo-Sub-Unguialis, or Flexor Brevis Digitorum Pedis Perforatus. 'This short muscle, which arises from the inferior and ante- rior part of the os calcis, and from the aponeurosis plantaris, splits into four small tendons, which give passage to the ten- dons of the long flexor; and are fixed into the second pha- lanx of the four small toes. Besides the muscles enumerated in the preceding pages, the following are proper to the great and little toes, viz. calco-sub- phalangeus, or the abductor pollicis ; metatarso-sub-phalan- geus transversalis pedis, or transversalis pedis ; metatarso-sub- phalangeus pollicis, or abductor pollicis ; tarso-phalangeus, or flexor longus pollicis pedis; tarso-sub-phalangeus pollicis, or flexor brevis pollicis , calco-sub-phalangeus minimi digiti, or abductor minimi digiti; tarso-sub-phalangeus minimi digiti, or flexor brevis minimi digiti. Tarso-Phalangeus, or Flexor Longus Pollicis Pedis. This long flexor muscle of the great toe arises from the posterior part of the fibula. It is covered by the soleus, and is placed between the flexor longus digitorum, and the pero- neus longus. The tendon of it passes through a groove in the tibia, then through a groove in the astragalus, crosses the sole of the foot, and is inserted into the last joint of the great toe. Calco-Sub-Phalangeus-Pollicis, or Abductor Pollicis Pedis. This muscle takes its rise from the lower and inner part of the heel-bone, and from that bone by a tendon, where it joins with the os naviculare; it is inserted into the os sesamoideum internum, and root of the first joint of the great toe. By this muscle the great toe is pulled from the others.

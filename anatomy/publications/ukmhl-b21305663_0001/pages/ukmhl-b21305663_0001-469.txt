MUSCLES OF THE TRUNK OF THE BODY. 423 temporal bone. The occipital bone is moved on the atlas by the following muscles. Axoido-Atloideus, or Obliquus Capitis Inferior. This muscle, which arises from the spinous process of the second cervical vertebra, and is fixed into the transverse pro- cess of the atlas, assists in rolling the head. Atloido-sub-Mastoideus, or Obliquus Capitis Superior. This muscle is placed laterally between the atlas and occi- put. It arises from the transverse process of the atlas ; and passes upwards and inwards, to be fixed into the end of the lower part of the occipital ridge, and back part of the mastoid process of the temporal bone. This muscle assists in rolling the head to one side, and in pulling it backwards. By the two following muscles,-the head is drawn backwards. Rectus Capitis Posticus Major, or Axoido-Occipitalis. The origins of this muscle are, the spinous and transverse processes of the second vertebra of the neck ; the muscle be- comes thicker in its ascent, and it is fixed into the os occipitis, near to the rectus capitis lateralis. Atloido-Occipitalis, or Rectus Capitis posticus minor. This muscle arises from the middle of the protuberance which is found instead of the spinous process of the first vertebra of the neck, and is fixed into the lower occipital ridge. The two following muscles are the antagonists of the former: Trachelo-sub-occipilalis major or Rectus Capitis anticus major. This muscle arises from the transverse process of the second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth cervical vertebra, and is fixed

OF THE OSSA SESAM01DEA. 295 metacarpal bone was secured, but it was as unsuccessful as the former. . , “ I observed that the surgeon pulled much downwards, by which the two bones were pressed closer together, instead of being disengaged ; and, therefore, I requested, that the me- tacarpal bone should be held fast; then I drew the root of it backwards, and then extended it, having previously bent the last joint, in order to shorten the flexor muscle, and ha- ving also rolled the radius outwards, to shorten the long ex- tensor muscles of the thumb.” This had the desired effect. Ossa Sesamoidea. The Ossa Sesamoidea are of very different figures and sizes, and are generally said to resemble the seed of the sesa- mam. These bones vary in number in different individuals. They are found at the origins of the gastrocnemii muscles, at the first and second joints of the great toes, and at the joints of the thumbs and fingers ; occasionally they are connected with the ossa pubis. Their number, figure, situation, and magnitude, are so uncertain that it were in vain to insist on the differences of each. The sesamoid bones at the first joint of the great toe are the largest, are early formed, and are seldom wanting in an adult. These bones, by increasing the angle of insertion of the tendons of the flexor muscles, add considerably to the force of these muscles ; and they may possibly tend to pre- vent the above mentioned tendons from being compressed by the weight of the body. That the sesamoid bones are not formed in consequence of pressure, is evident, as in the foetus a few months after con- ception, there are cartilages of a similar figure as the sesamoid bones. SECTION III. OF THE OS HYOIDES. It yet remains to take notice of the Os IJyoldes, which is not immediately (excepting in a very few rare cases) con- nected with any of the other bones,

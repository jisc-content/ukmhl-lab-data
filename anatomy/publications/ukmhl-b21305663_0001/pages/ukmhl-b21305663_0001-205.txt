OF THE BONES OF THE FACE. 159 But the above method of estimating the differences in skulls of different nations is imperfect; for it points out only those distinctions which result from the degrees of prominence of the fore head and jaws: it is liable also to insuperable objec- tions ; for there are skulls of different nations which have the same prominence of the jaws, but which are very different in other respects, and, on the other hand, there are also crania which agree in most respects as to form, but the jaws of such skulls are widely different as to the degree of prominence, and of course as to the direction of the facial line. Beside, there are many of the nations inhabiting different parts of Africa, whose head in form resembles that of the European; for instance, the skull of the Kaffer Hottentot (which now lies before me) differs but little from that of the European. The upper jaw, which is bounded above by the transverse- suture, behind by the fore part of the sphenoid bone, and be- low by the mouth, was formerly described as consisting only of thirteen bones, viz. two ossa nasi, two ossa unguis, two ossa malarum, two ossa maxillaria, two ossa palati, two ossa spongiosa inferior a, and the vomer. Bertin and Albinus have described two small additional bones, which are connected with the sphenoidal bone. The ossa nasi are placed at the upper part of the nose; the ossa unguis are at the internal canthi of the orbits ; the ossa malarum form the prominence of the cheeks; the ossa maxillaria form the side of the nose, with the lower and fore part of the upper jaw, and the greatest share of the roof of the mouth ; ossa palati, are situated at the back part of the palate, nostrils, and orbit; ossa spongiosa are seen in the lower part of the nares ; and the vomer forms a part of the partition of the nose. The bones of the upper jaw are connected to each other by gompnosis and fifteen sutures. The first is the anterior nasal, which is straight, and placed longitudinally in the middle fore part of the nose.

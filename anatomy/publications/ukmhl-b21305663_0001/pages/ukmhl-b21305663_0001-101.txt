OF THE GROWTH OF RONE. 55 sooner reunite after a fracture than those of old, and why cat- tle that are put too soon to hard labour, are seldom of such large size as others of the same brood, which are longer kept from labour. But the above theory of my Grandfather, of Baron Haller, and others, is inadequate to the explanation of the process of ossification, which, in many cases, takes place where pressure cannot exert its influence. Bony matter is secreted from the blood, like the bile or urine, and formed into its proper con- sistence by the action of the circulating and absorbent vessels, independently of pressure, which cannot therefore be admitted to be the principal cause of ossification. Pressure, after the bones have been formed, may perhaps have some effect in con- densing them. Climate may also accelerate the process of ossification. Whence, in hot countries, the inhabitants sooner arrive at their full stature than in northerly cold regions. Authors on the Bones of the Adult. Vesalius, De Corporis Humani fabrica.

OF THE LIGAMENTS, 309 SECTION II. GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE LIGAMENTS. The ligaments are strong and flexible membranes, of a com- pact structure, and yellowish colour, which are composed of a number of fibres intimately interwoven with each other, and passing in different directions; and the greater number of these pass in the direct line between the parts which the liga- ment connects. The ligaments are of very different degrees of thickness, and generally may be resolved into two layers, the outer of which is considerably thicker than the inner. The ligaments receive their supply of blood from those ar- teries which are in their immediate vicinity ; and these arteries freely and frequently communicate with each other. These arteries are accompanied by corresponding veins, and also by lymphatic vessels. The ligaments possess but a very small share of elasticity and sensibility, though the nerves may be traced into their substance *. That ligaments do not possess a large share of sensibility, was made manifest by the experiments of Haller. He laid bare the ligaments of an animal, and poured an acrid liquor into the joint, which seemed to give the animal but little pain. But, though ligaments, in their sound state, possess but a small share of sensibility, yet, when inflamed, they create great pain, and that inflammation sometimes proves fatal. Hence when there is a necessity of cutting into the joints, in order to extract cartilaginous bodies, the air, which proves the cause of acute inflammation of serous membranes, should be carefully excluded, by drawing up the skin, and then cut- ting upon the cartilaginous body, and turning it out of the joint, and afterwards allowing the skin to slide back into its original place, so as to cover the hole in the capsular ligament. The incision ought afterwards to be well covered by dressing, â€¢ Vide Movko on the Nervous System.

10 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 11 th, The fluoric acid has been found by Berzelius in bones and urine, and also combined with lime. 1 %th, Muriatic acid is combined with an alkali in many of the animal fluids, as with soda and ammonia in urine. 13th, Uric acid, or lithic acid, is found in urine and urinary calculi; likewise in the excrements of birds, reptiles, and in- sects. 14th, Lactic acid is found in many of the animal fluids, combined with soda and ammonia. 15th, Amniotic acid was found by Vauquelin in the liquor amnii of the cow. 16th, Formic acid is formed by infusing ants in water. 17th, Benzoic acid is found in the urine of children, and of cows. 18^/i, Oxalic acid is found combined with lime in urinary calculi. 19tli. Acetic acid is found in milk, combined with potash. 20th. Malic acid is combined with the formic acid, in the liquor got from the red ant. These different substances, differently combined, form the â– different solids and fluids of the body. CHAP. II. OBSERVATIONS ON THE SKELETON. Every animal that is capable of progressive motion, is provided with muscles appropriated to that purpose, which are connected with some fixed point or points.

OF THE FORM OF THE SKULL. 205 In describing the diffei'ent skulls, I have followed the ar- rangement of Blumenbach, though it may be said to be ar- bitrary and imperfect, as it is upon the whole the best classi- fication which has been yet published. The 1st great class comprehends all the inhabitants of the world that were known to the ancients, excepting the Lap- landers. Of this great class Blumenbacu supposes the Caucassian Family to have been the original stock. I have taken my characters of this class from the skull of a Circassian girl, of ten or twelve years of age, which is of sin- gular beauty in its form and proportions, and which corres- ponds very nearly to the Georgian skull represented by Bi,u- MENBACH. The contour of the whole skull is elegant. The ctanial part bears a large proportion to the bones of the face; the forehead is large and prominent, and the facial line is straight; the cheek bones are rounded; the alveolar arch narrow and not prominent. The zygomatic arches are slender, but not much elevated. The orbits are large, and less angular than in other skulls. The alveolar arch is elliptical, but nar- row *. The Greeks are also included in this class. The cranial part of the skull is very large in proportion to the face; and the facial line is straight. Blumenbach has stated, that he possesses an ancient Greek skull, which was procured in Magna Grecia, in which the cranial part of the skull bears as large a proportion to the bones of the face, as in any of the celebrated busts of anti- quity f. Even at this day, the cranial part of the Greek skull is large, in proportion to the bones of the face. As a specimen of a Scotch skull, I shall describe that of King Robert the Bruce, which I assisted in removing * For the measures see No. 1. of Table II. 1" My friend Mr Lister told me he had seen this remarkable skull.

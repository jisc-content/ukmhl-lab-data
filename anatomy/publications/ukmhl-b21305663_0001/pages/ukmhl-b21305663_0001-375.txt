LIGAMENTS OF THE CLAVICLE, &C. 329 SECTION IV. LIGAMENTS OF THE SUPERIOR EXTREMITY. LIGAMENTS OF THE CLAVICLE, SCAPULA, AND SHOULDER- JOINT. Front View. The ligaments of the extremities of the body merit the most particular attention of the surgeon, not only on account of the injuries to which they are exposed from being wounded, sprained, or lacerated, but also as they are liable to suffer from peculiar organic derangements. It has been already ob- served, that, when a bone has been dislocated, the ligaments are generally torn ; and hence, that only a surgeon who pos- sesses an accurate knowledge of the structure of the ligaments, is capable of treating judiciously such an accident. There are a number of ligamentous fibres which inclose the capsular ligament, which connects the clavicle to the breast- bone, and within that joint there is an inter-articular cartilage, like to that of the under-jaw. This^ cartilage is placed ob- liquely, with its upper part directed inwards, and its lower outwards towards the first rib. There is a ligament which passes across the sternum, from one clavicle to the other, which adheres to the capsular liga- ment, and also to the uppermost part of the breast-bones, and tends to fix the collar-bones intimately to each other. There is a flat and short ligament, of a rhomboidal figure, covered by the subclavian muscle, which extends between the under surface of the clavicle, at no great distance from its neck, to the cartilage of the first rib. There is a ligament, called by Caldani Income, which arises from the coracoid process of the scapula, and ascends obliquely; it consists of two parts ; the one of which is fixed into the inferior part of the clavicle near to the rhomboidal ligament; the other part of it is fixed into the first rib, under the tendon of the subclavian muscle.

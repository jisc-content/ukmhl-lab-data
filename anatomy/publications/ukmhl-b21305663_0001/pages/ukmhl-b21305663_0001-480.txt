elements of anatomy. 434 operate. But, if the arm be raised, and a firm body be taken hold of, the body is drawn towards the arm, as when the legs are thrown upwards. Epicondylo-Ulnalis, or Anconeus. This muscle, which arises from the posterior part of the ex- ternal condyle of jbe os humeri, and is inserted into a ridge on the outer and back-part of the ulna, assists the triceps in extending the fore-arm. The places of the insertions of the muscles into the hume- rus merit the peculiar attention of the surgeon, from their in- fluence upon the different fractures of this bone. Thus, when the neck of the humerus has been broken, the great pectoral muscle and teres major, and long head of the triceps, draw the lower portion of the broken bone inwards, and then upwards; and the upper portion of the bone is drawn outwards by the supra-spinatus and teres minor muscles. When the humerus has been broken transversely below the insertion of the deltoid muscle, the broken pieces of the bone are not displaced, the broken portions being kept together by the triceps muscle, and brachialis internus. But, if the fracture be oblique, the under portion of the broken bone is drawn upwards by the biceps flexor cubiti of the deltoid muscle and long head of the triceps. The olecranon ulnae may be compared to the patel- la and, like it, has sometimes been broken by the triceps extensor cubiti, which is inserted into it, though more fre- quently by external violence. When the olecranon has been detached from the body of the bone, it is always drawn up- wards by the contraction of the triceps extensor muscle; and the detached portions are disjoined when the arm is bent. In the treatment of this fracture, it is the object of the surgeon to keep the broken pieces in contact with each other, by ex- tending the fore-arm, and by bandages.

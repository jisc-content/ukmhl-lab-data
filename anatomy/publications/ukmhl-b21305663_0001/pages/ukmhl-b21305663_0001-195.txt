149 OF THE OS ETHMOIDES. cartilage is separated by maceration; and sometimes little dis- tinct bones are seen towards the edges of it. The second and third pieces of this bone are exactly alike, and situated on each side of the great foramen, from which the condyles are produced; and are extended forwards almost to the fore-part of the hole for the ninth pair of nerves. The cuneiform pro- cess, which forms a small share of the great hole, constitutes the fourth piece ; and betwixt it and the sphenoid bone a car- tilage is interposed. Os Ethmoides. The Os Ethmoides * * * §, or the sieve-like bone, is made up of the cribriform lamella, the nasal lamella, cellulee, and ossa spongiosa; all which are thin layers of bone, and form an ex- tensive surface, but occupy little space. The thin cribriform lamella, is (except its back part) pierced obliquely by a great number of small holes, through which the filaments of the olfactory nerves pass -f*, which have been very minutely described by Scarpa, in his Anat. Acad. From the middle of this plate, a thick process, called Crista Galli rises upwards; and, being highest at the fore part, gradually becomes lower, as it is extended back- wards. To the ridge of crista galli l, the falx is con- nected to the unperforated part of the cribriform plate. When the crista is broken, its base is sometimes found to be hollow, with its cavity opening into the nose §. I have seen the crista galli inclined to one side, so as to cover the holes on one side of the cribriform place. Immediately before the highest part of this process, is the blind hole of the frontal bone, which is often in a great measure formed by a notch in the fore part of the root of the crista.

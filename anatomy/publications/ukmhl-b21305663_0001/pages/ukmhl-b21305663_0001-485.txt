439 MUSCLES or THE THUMB. Epitrochlo- Phalangeus, or Flexor Digitorum Sublimis Perforatus. This muscle takes its origin from the internal condyle of the os humeri, and from the coronoid process of the ulna, and also from the fore-part of the tubercle of the radius. The muscle which passes behind the pronator radii teres, the flexor carpi radialis, and palmaris longus, divides into four tendons, which pass under the anterior annular ligament, and are inserted into the second phalanx of the fingers; and at the first phalanx the tendons are perforated by those of the flexor digitorum profundus. Palmo-PhaIcmge'i, or Lumhricales. These four muscular slips are connected to the tendons of the last-named muscle; and at the under ends of the meta- carpal bones they send off small tendons, which are fixed in- to the tendons of the interossei muscles, about the middle of the first phalanx. These muscles have but little effect; they increase the power of the flexors of the fingers. Ulno-Sub-Unguialis, or Flexor Digitorum Profundus. This muscle arises from the upper part of the ulna, and from the interosseous ligaments; it is placed behind the flexor sublimis, and divides into four tendons, which are fixed into the upper part of the third phalanx of the fingers. By the flexor sublimis, the second and first phalanges of the fingers are bent; and by the latter the third phalanx. Muscles of the Thumb. The superiority of the human hand is owing to the size and strength of the thumb, which may be made to oppose the fingers, in grasping substances. The thumb and fingers, owing to their number of joints, possess great flexibility, and are so constructed as to be accurately adapted to those sub- stances we take hold of; and, as the length and size of the bones of the thumb and fingers gradually decrease, we can

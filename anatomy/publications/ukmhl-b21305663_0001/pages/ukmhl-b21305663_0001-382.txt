The crural arch is seen extending from the anterior and superior spinous process of the ilium, and with its fibres in- serted into the opposite os pubis. A few ligamentous fibres ex- tend downwards from the superior and anterior spinous pro- cess of the os ilium, to the inferior and anterior spinous pro- cess of the os ilium A strong capsular ligament unites the surfaces of the ossa pubis, which are in contact at the interior of the symphysis pubis, from which there is, on each side, a round and strong li- gament, which descends to the tuberosities of the ischia, and between the ossa pubis there is a ligamento-cartilaginous sub- stance, composed of fibres passing in a transverse direction, or sometimes two cartilaginous substances, broader in the fe- male than in the male. The obturator foramen is filled up by a ligament, in which there is a large aperture for the obturator artery and nerve, and three other small apertures, from which small branches of the obturator artei’y, vein and nerve pass outwards, and get into the acetabulum, to supply the synovial apparatus within the hip-joint. Back View of the Pelvis. There are two ligaments disposed transversely, which unite the os sacrum to the ossa innominata, besides a general capsu- lar ligament, and there is within the joint a ligamento-car- tilaffinous substance. o A long and strong ligament called ilio-sacral, originates from the posterior spinous process of the spine of the os ilium, and descending obliquely is fixed into the lower part of the os sacrum. There is also a shorter ligament which is fixed higher into the os sacrum. The posterior part of the os sacrum is covered by a liga- • For a more particular description of this ligament, see account of the mus- cles of the fore-part of the abdomen.

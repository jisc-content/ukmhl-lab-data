424 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. into the cuneiform process of the occipital bone, where it joins â€¢with the sphenoid bone. Trachelo-sub-occipitalis minor, or Rectus Capitis anticus minor. This muscle lies under the former: it arises from the ante- rior part of the atlas, and is fixed into the occipital bone, near the condyle. Atloido sub-occipitalis, or Rectus Capitis lateralis. This muscle takes its origin from the anterior part of the transverse process of the atlas, and is fixed into the side of the cuneiform process of the occipital bone. This muscle pulls the head to one side. Some of the muscles which are fixed to the bones ^of the head and os hyoides, assist in the movements of the head, viz. the sterno-mastoid, sterno-thyroid, sterno-hyoid, omo- hyoid, rnylo-hyoid, genio-hyoid, digastric, and platysma myoides. The rotatory motion of the head is performed by the fol- lowing muscles : axoido-atloideus, part of the splenius of the right side, the left complexus, the right platysma, and left sterno-mastoid, and right trapezius. Prcedorso-atloideus, or Longus Colli. This muscle, which is situated behind the gullet and great bloodvessels and nerves of the arm, is attached to the three uppermost dorsal vertebrae, and to the transverse processes of the four undermost cervical vertebrae; and it is fixed to the fore parts of the cervical vertebrae, by ten- dons. It tends, with its fellow, to bend the neck forwards; and when only one of the muscles acts, the head is pulled to one side. Besides the above muscles, which more properly belong to the head, there are certain muscles of the shoulder, viz. the

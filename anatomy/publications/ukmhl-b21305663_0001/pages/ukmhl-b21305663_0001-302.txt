256 ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. The Caiipus is composed of eight small bones ; os scaphoi- deSy lunare, cuneiforme, pisiforme, trapezium, trapezoides, magnum, uncforme. The scaphoides is situated most internally of those that are articulated with the fore-arm. The lunare is immediately on the outside of the former. The cuneiforme is placed still more externally, but does not reach so high up as the other two. The pisiforme stands forwards into the palm from the cu- neiforme. The trapezium is the first of the second row, and is situ- ated betwixt the scaphoides and first, joint of the thumb. The trapezoides is immediately on the outside of the tra- pezium. The os magnum is still more external. The unciforme is farther to the side of the little finger. Of the Os Scaphoides. The Os Scaphoides is the largest of the eight except one. It is convex above, concave and oblong below, and bears a distant resemblance to a boat; hence its name. Its smooth convex surface is divided by a rough middle fossa, which runs obliquely across it. The upper largest division is articulated with the radius. Into the fossa the common ligament of the joint of the wrist is fixed ; and the lower division is joined to the trapezium and trapezoides. The concavity receives more than a half of the round head of the os magnum. The ex- ternal side of this hollow is formed into a semilunar plane, to be articulated with the following bone. The internal, poste- rior, and interior edges are rough, for fixing the ligaments that connect it to the surrounding bones. Of the Os Lunare. The Os Lunare has a smooth convex upper surface, by which it is articulated with the radius. The internal side, which gives the name to the bone, is in the form of a crescent, and is joined with the scaphoid; the lower surface is hollow, for receiving part of the head of the os magnum.

33 OF THE BONES. a oreat number of claviculi, or small bony processes, which, rising from the inner plates, pierce through some, and are fixetfinto the more external ones. Of these nails, four kinds, viz. the perpendicular, oblique, headed and crooked, have been described: But in bones properly prepared, we can see only numerous irregular processes rising out from the plates *; so that we are not to imagine that the lamellae are fixed to each other by nails, there being merely an intermixture to a certain degree of the constituent fibres of the bone. Bones are more or less cavernous internally, for the sake of lightness. In some (e. g. middle thin part of the scapula and os ilium) the solid sides are brought so near that little cavity can be seen; and in others (middle of os humeri, fe- moris, &c.) the cavities are so large that such bones are ge- nerally esteemed to be hollow. The internal spongy texture is evident in young animals; and sometimes it is found in those of the oldest people. This spongy cavernous internal part of bones is formed by layers detached from the inner surfaces of the bones, which are interwoven with those of the opposite side of the bone. As the cells are most numerous at the extremities of the bones, the solid walls or sides are not thicker than paper ; but the solid walls are thicker at the middle part of the bone, there being; fewer cells in that situation. These cancelli differ considerably in figure, number and size; and communicate with each other. Some writers -f* have described differences in the appearance of the cancelli; and from thence distinguish them into wrinkled, perforated and nct-like. The cancelli sustain the marrow, and prevent one part of it from compressing another. The depressions between the fibres of the external plates of bones appear like so many fur- rows on their surface, by which the surface of contact, and con- * Malpigh. Oper. Posthum. t Gagliard.

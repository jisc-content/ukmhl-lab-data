The body of the horse’s tooth is equal in length to the breadth of the jaw; and as the upper surface of the tooth is worn down, the roots are added, in consequence of which the tooth rises in the jaw. The wearing down of the horse’s teeth is well known to jockeys : thus they judge of a horse’s age; for between the seventh and eighth year the cavity in the middle of the incisor teeth, which is filled by a blackish tartar, is no longer visible, in consequence of the teeth having been worn down. Of the Period at which the First Set of Teeth, or Temporary Teeth, appears. There is the utmost variety as to the time at which the teeth appear. In a stout, healthy child, the incisor teeth of the under jaw show themselves between the sixth and seventh month after birth; but, in a puny, sickly child, not until the child is per- haps a year old. There are some diseases which seem to have a specific ef- fect in arresting the growth of the teeth. I have repeatedly observed, that children labouring under rickets, or the chronic form of the disease called water in the head, do not get their teeth till they are two or three years old. The larger incisors of the under jaw first cut the gum. A few weeks after the central incisors of the under jaw have cut the gum, those of the upper show themselves, and, in the next place, the lateral incisors of both jaws. When the child is about a year and a half old, the smaller grinders of the lower jaw cut the gum ; these are followed by the smaller cor- responding grinders of the upper jaw. In the foetal jaw, the smaller incisor, and the smaller grind-

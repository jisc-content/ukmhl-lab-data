or THE OSSA PARIETALIA. 137 of use to surgeons, when they make any incision near this part of the head ; lest, if the vessels are rashly cut near the hole, they shrink within the substance of the bone, and oc- casion an obstinate haemorrhagy, which cannot be stopped. My grandfather, in his manuscript commentary upon his Osteology, has observed on this hole:—“ Whether it is an artery or a vein that passes through this hole, an obstinate haemorrhage may be caused by cutting it very near to the hole, for if it is a vein it communicates with the superior longitudinal sinus, which may furnish blood as long as the orifice, shrunk within the substance of the bone, is open; and if it is an artery, it communicates both with the largest lateral artery of the dura mater, and with the internal carotid, from the anastomosing canals of which the blood may flow in- to this one, to have a motion retrograde to what it has natu- rally, and to occasion likewise an haemorrhage, that neither stitching nor pressure can be applied to stop, and where es- charotics or styptics cannot have their full effect. I remem- ber to have seen a man, who in his drunkenness fell down a stair, and cut this part of his head, which bled so obstinate- ly, that four or five of our best surgeons could not stop it any considerable time, till the man became so faint, that he lay with little sense or motion for several days ; after this there was no more bleeding, and he recovered. I saw this man a few years ago, he shewed me the scar of his wound, which is at a place in the head where there is not any other vessel but what might have been easily stopped from bleeding. Styptics with pressure continued long on the part, are what I would try in such a case. If this had not success, I would push the point of a red hot iron into the hole : you may believe that I would have the iron of a conical figure; so that it should not pass through the skull to hurt the internal parrs, and that I would not keep it long applied, lest the dura ma- ter should be injured.” On the inner concave surface of the parietal bones, there are a great many deep furrows, for lodging the arteries distri- buted on the surface of the dura mater and the large ve- nous sinuses. The furrows for the arteries are disposed

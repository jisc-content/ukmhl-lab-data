ELEMENTS OE ANATOMY. 40 by (ceding animals with madder, being removed; and from the effect of unnatural pressure on bones, and of remedies in removing their diseases ; and also, from the swelling of the glands connected with the lymphatic system, which is the con- comitant of many diseases of the bones. My Father was, I believe, the author of the doctrine of the absorption of bones, and the other solid parts of the body. He made mention of this doctrine in his lectures, accord- ing to his statement, since the year 1759; whereas, according to Sir E. Home, “ Mr John Hunter’s Observations on the Growth of Bones have been mentioned in his lectures only since the year 1772,—the first year in which he gave lectures.” Upon the above principle my Father endeavoured to ex- plain the disappearance of the upper part of the breast-bone in cases of aneurism of the arch of the aorta, which Dr Wil- liam Hunter imputed to a solvent power of the blood : “ But in this case,” (he has observed) “ the appearance was rather as if the blood had insensibly dissolved, and washed away the substance of the bone, making greatest havoc in the softest part of the bone, as we see in stones of unequal texture that have been long washed by a dropping, or a stream of water. Has the blood that property, which some have as- cribed to it, of dissolving bony matter ?” It is plain, then, either that Mr John Hunter had not, at that time, proposed the doctrine of the Absorption of Osseous Matter; or, if he did so, that his brother was ignorant of it, or paid no regard to it.

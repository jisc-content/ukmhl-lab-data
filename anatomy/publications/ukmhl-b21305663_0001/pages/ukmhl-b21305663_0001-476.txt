430 ELKMENTS OF ANATOMY. cesses of the lumbar and seven inferior dorsal vertebra?, and from the extremities of the four lowest ribs. The fleshy fi- bres ascend obliquely, pass over the inferior angle of the sca- pula, are collected, twisted in the axilla, and then fixed into the inner edge of the groove which receives the long tendon of the scapulo-radialis. This muscle pulls the humerus backwards and downwards, and also rolls it. The five following muscles arise from the scapula : the three first roll the os humeri outwards, and the other two antago- nize these. The two following muscles are covered by an aponeurosis, extending between the costae and spine of the scapula. Super-Scapulo-Trochitereus Parvus, or Supra-Spinatus. This muscle arises from that part of the scapula which is above the spine of the scapula, and from the spine and supe- rior costa of the scapula, and its tendons pass under the acro- mion above the articulation, and are fixed into the anterior part of the great tuberosity of the humerus. This muscle also assists in raising the arm. Super-Scapulo-Trochitcreus Magnus, or Injrar-Spinatus. This muscle fills up the greater part of the scapula, which is below the spine of that bone; the fibres of it are oblique in respect to its tendon, which is fixed into the middle part of the greater tuberosity of the os humeri. The trapezius muscle covers the upper and back part of this muscle, and the anterior part of it is concealed by the deltoid muscle. This muscle assists in raising the arm, and rolls it outwards when raised. Super-Scapulo-Trochitereus Minimus, or Teres Minor. This muscle arises from the inferior edge of the scapula, between the infra-spiriatus and teres major ; it ascends along the under edge of the infra-spinatus, and is fixed into the back-part of the larger tuberosity of the os humeri. As the tendon of this muscle is fixed to the capsular ligament, and

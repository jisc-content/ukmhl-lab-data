ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 134 very far advanced in life, and that the skulls were as thick as if the frontal sinuses had been present, for the space between the tables of the frontal bone was filled up by a cancellated bony structure. I measured the breadth, or distance across the forehead; the height, or distance from the transverse suture upwards, where it divides the frontal bone and bones of the nose, and also the depth of the frontal sinuses, in nine different skulls in which these sinuses were large, and found them as under: No. Breadth.

These passages of communication are by no means uniform in point of size, and in some of the skulls were twice as large as in others. The sinuses may be compared to vaults: they increase the intensity of the sound of the voice, and also render it more melodious. * In this specimen the frontal sinuses extended backwards to the sphenoid hone.

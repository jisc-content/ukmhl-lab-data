OF DISTORTION OF THE SPINE. 65 made by tbe stays or steel on the spinal processes on any part of the skin that was galled by the prominent bone. Let the lower end of the steel-plates rest on a bolster put on the up- per part of the os sacrum, and put a belt round the part of the strap where the steel-plates bear it a little out from the body. A boy who had the two last vertebrae of the back, and the first of the loins, swelled greatly behind, by which he was greatly bended forwards, and could not walk twice through my chamber without great pain and fatigue, had a pair of such stays,- made by my direction, applied to him in my house, which was then at the Guard, and walked immediately to Heriot’s Bridge in the Grass-market, (near half a mile), with- out much uneasiness, and became much straighter afterwards by using those stays. Several who were much crooked to aside were cured by a strap with plates of steel at the sides. In all which, instead of putting bolsters in the concave par(s, which the common stay-makers always do, with the design of concealing the deformity, I placed the bolster on the convex, where the steel, pressed by the belts, pressed most on the ribs or spine.1’ The inclination of the Spine forwards often lays the foun- dation of the most incurable disorders, palsy and oedema of the lower limbs ; owing to the degree of pressure upon the spinal cord and vena cava made at the seat of the curvature ; and when the ribs also become distorted, asthma, a dropsy of the chest, or phthisis pulmonalis, frequently follow. Of the True Vertebra. The tree vertebra have been divided into three classes, viz. / cervical, 12 dorsal, and 5 lumbar, and in some Negroes, 6 lumbar vertebra have been found. My Father informed me, that he remarked 6 lumbar vertebra in the skeletons of some giants he had seen at Berlin. Qf the Cervical Vertebra:. The distinguishing characters of the seven uppermost or cervical vertebra:, are ; their bodies are smaller and more solid VOL. I.

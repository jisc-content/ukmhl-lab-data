209 OF THE ETHIOPIAN CLASS. But the old Egyptian sculpture represents all the Egyptians as alike ; for, though the sculpture is rude, it conveys a dis- tinct idea of the form of the head and features. I have been led to this opinion, from having lately examined many speci- mens which that distinguished artist Mr John Watson shewed me. The form of the head is similar to that of the Hindoo; the eyes are large, and distant from each other; the eye-lids run up to the temples ; the ears are placed high on the head ; the mouth is very small; the lips thin ; the chin is pointed, and with a dimple on it. Dexon, whose authority in all matters connected with the fine arts stands very high, in his Account of Egypt, has given representations of the heads of mummies, which re- semble the finest formed heads of Europe. He has distinctly stated that, in point of form, they are equal to the heads of the celebrated sybils of Michael Angelo ; and Cuvier *, who has had occasion to examine 50 mummies, has published a similar report on the form of the Egyptian head. Of the Second or Ethiopian Classâ€¢ This class includes all the Africans which are not compre- hended under the first class. The form of the skull in all of these is somewhat similar to that of the Negro. The bone is very white, of a compact texture, like to ivory, and heavy; and the tables of the skull are thicker than those of European skulls. The distinctive characters of the Negro skull, are the small size of the cranial part of the bone, in its longitudinal and transverse direction ; the retreating forehead, which is also narrow ; the flatness of the sides of the head; the large size of the temporal fossae ; and the large size of the temporal ridges of the frontal bone, which are sometimes serrated. The pa- rietal bones are smaller, and the impressions made by the tem- poral muscles are nearer to each other, than in the European. * See his Account of the Hottentot Venus. Annal. du Mus. tom. iii.

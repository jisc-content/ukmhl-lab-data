The bile which is contained within the gall-bladder is more viscid, ropy, and more bitter than that within the hepatic duct: which circumstance has given rise to the opinion, that there are two very different kinds of bile, one kind secreted by the liver, the other by the bloodvessels in the villous coat of the gall-bladder, a fact which was supposed to be confirmed by analogy. Albinus remarked, that the cystic and hepatic ducts of the domestic fowl do not form a common trunk, but run in a direction parallel to each other, and open separately into the duodenum. My Father examined this matter many years ago with atten- tion, and found that the gall-bladder of the domestic fowl re- ceived its bile, by hepato-cystic ducts, and that such were al- ways to be found when the hepatic duct was not evidently con- nected with the cystic duct between the liver and duodenum, but were wanting in those instances in which the trunk of the hepatic duct was connected with the cystic duct: hence the cystic bile of all animals is derived from the liver. As the cystic bile is derived from the liver, and as in man there are no hepato-cystic ducts, the bile must pass to and fro in the cystic duct, and probably by means of a peristaltic and antiperistaltic power: from this cause chiefly the bile is pushed upwards into the gall-bladder and returns a- gain, just as the alimentary matter is moved to and fro in the intestina caeca of a fowl. Of the Chemical Attalysis of the Bile. Bile is an animal soap. Bile contains, according to Mr Thenard, some yellow matter suspended in it: and when evaporated to dryness, it leaves a brown matter, amounting to about T\th of its original weight. The following substances, and the following propor- tions of these, were obtained by Thenard * from 1100 parts of human bile.

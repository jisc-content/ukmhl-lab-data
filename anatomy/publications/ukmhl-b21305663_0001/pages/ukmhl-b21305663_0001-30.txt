PREFACE. xxir The plan of the present work being more compre- hensive, and quite different from that of my Outlines, it seemed necessary to express that change, by a change of the Title. These volumes are therefore en- titled, Elements of Anatomy. They have been writ- ten for the use of Students of that Science in general, as well as for my own pupils; and though, from their title, they may be supposed to relate to the Anatomy of the Human Body in its sound state only, yet, as Comparative Anatomy, Physiology, Pathology and Surgery, are inseparable from Human Anatomy, it seemed impossible to avoid introducing remarks on these very important sciences. Animal Chemistry has not been overlooked. It has proved a source of much useful information, re- specting the various solids and secreted fluids, and al- so respecting those morbid concretions which are sometimes found in the passages through which the spittle, bile, urine, and other fluids pass, and which prove a source of so much uneasiness, and often of death. The remarks relating to Physiology, Pathology and Surgery, are necessarily of a limited nature, and such only as arise more immediately out of the Anatomy of the parts concerned. In accordance with the wishes of booksellers, my Elements have been limited to two volumes, closely printed ; containing, perhaps, as much matter as three or four volumes, printed in the style of my Outlines. There are before the public books upon Anatomy of very different descriptions. There are some authors who have limited themselves to General Anatomy ; others to Descriptive Anatomy ; a third set to Surgi- cal, and a fourth to Comparative Anatomy.

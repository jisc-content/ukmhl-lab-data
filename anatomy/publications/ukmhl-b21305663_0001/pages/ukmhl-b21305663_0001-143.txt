OF THE OS ISCHIUM. 97 From the circumference of this large unequal surface, liga- ments are extended to the os sacrum, to secure more firmly the conjunction of these bones. The passages of the medullary vessels are generally conspi- cuous, both in the dorsum and costa of many ossa ilia. The posterior and lower parts of these bones are thick ; but they are generally exceedingly thin and compact, at their middle. The substance of the ossa ilia is cellular, except a thin ex- ternal table. The spine of the os ilium of a child is cartilaginous, and is afterwards joined to the bone in form of an epiphysis *. The large lower end of this bone is not completely ossified. Os Ischium. The os ischium, or hip-bone, is of a viiddle bulk between the two other 'parts of the os innominatum ; is situated lowest of the three, and is of a very irregular figure. Its extent might be marked by an horizontal line drawn nearly through the middle of the acetabulum; for the upper bulbous part of this bone forms somewhat less than the lower half of that great cavity, and the small leg of it rises to much the same height on the other side of the great hole common to this bone and the os pubis. Processes.—A sharp process, called by some spinous, stands out backwards, from the upper part of the os ischium, which gives rise to the musculus coccygaeus and superior gemellus, and part of the levator ani; and the interior or internal sacro- sciatic ligament is fixed to it. Between the upper part of this ligament and the bones, the pyriform muscle, the posterior crural vessels, and the sciatic nerve, pass out of the pelvis. Immediately below this pro- cess, a sinuosity is formed for the tendon of the musculus ob- turator intemus. In a recent subject, this part of the bone, which serves as a pully on which the obturator muscle plays, * Vid. Albinus’s tables of the bones of the ftetus. VOL. T. G

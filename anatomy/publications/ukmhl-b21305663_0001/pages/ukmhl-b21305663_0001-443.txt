PARIETES OF THE ABDOMEN. 397 men, and are fixed into the linea alba and ensiform cartilage of the sternum. Sterno-pubalis, or Rectus Abdominis. This muscle arises from the cartilages of the three under- most true ribs, and extremity of the breast-bone. It forms a broad flat muscle, which is disposed in a parallel manner to the linea alba; and it is at length fixed into the fore and up- per part of the os pubis. In its course to the umbilicus, three tendinous lines pass across it; and, between the navel and the ossa pubis, there is a portion of tendon which extends only half wray across the muscle. Owing to the distention of the muscles during pregnancy, considerable pain is often felt at the insertion of the recti muscles into the ossa pubis. Pubio-sub-umbilicalis, or Pyramidalis. This muscle is named Pyramidal from its shape. The base of the pyramid is connected to the upper part of the symphysis pubis; and the apex of it is fixed into the linea alba, about half way between the navel and ossa pubis. The muscles of the parietes of the abdomen, besides com- pressing the hollow bowels included within them, and also the bowels of the pelvis expelling their contents, tend to bend the body to a side, and draw the ribs directly downwards ; or, if the thorax be fixed, the pelvis is drawn upwards: by their continued action, the heels may be thrown over the head. It may be proper to add, that the internal oblique muscle of the right side co-operates in its action with the external oblique of the left side. The tendinous sheath of the sterno-pubalis preserves that muscle in its proper place when the body is bent. Anatomical Description of the Internal Parts in the Male. Upon removing the peritonaeum which lines the abdominal, iliaco-intemus, and psoas muscles, the umbilical arteries changed into ligaments, and the urachus, come into view. rI he spermatic vessels are also exposed ; and these sweep a^-

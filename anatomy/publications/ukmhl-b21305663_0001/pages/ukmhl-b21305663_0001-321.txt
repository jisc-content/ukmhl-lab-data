275 OF FRACTURE OF THE THIGH-BONE. a lad of eighteen years ot age, could walk, and even run well. On opening the capsular ligament, I observed that the head had been detached from the neck of the bone by a fracture. The neck being considerably flattened, probably by having been rubbed against the acetabulum, was unequal on its sur- face, and covered in two or three different places by small white and very hard pieces of bone. The head of the bone, which was fixed in its place by the orbicular ligament, had not its usual rounded form. Fractures without the capsular ligament may happen at any period of life, and these are often united by callus. Of the Leg. In the Leg there are two bones, the tibia andfibula. There are national peculiarities as to the form of the legs. In the Negro, Hindoo, and American Indian, the tibia and fibula are more convex anteriorly than in the European ; and the calves of the leg are very high, owing, probably, to their customs of resting the weight of the body on the lower limbs. The ancients have described defects in the form of the legs in the Egyptians and Ethiopeans. Pallas has imputed the form of the legs of the Calmucks to their riding at a very early period of life : and even in this country, the legs are of- ten bent outwards from riding. Of the Tibia. The Tibia, so called from its resemblance to an old musi- cal pipe or flute, is a long thick triangular bone, situated at the internal part of the leg, and continued in almost a straight line from the thigh-bone. The large upper end of the tibia is divided into two cavi- ties, by a rough irregular protuberance, which is hollow at its most prominent part, as well as before and behind. The anterior crucial ligament is inserted into the middle cavity, and the depression behind receives the posterior ligament. The two broad cavities at the sides of this protuberance are not of equal depth : the internal is oblong and deep, to

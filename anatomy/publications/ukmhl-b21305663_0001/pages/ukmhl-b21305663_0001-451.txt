ABDOMINAL MUSCLES.â€”INFEltENCES. 405 more harm than good, for, by rarifying the air within the protruded intestine, they add to the bulk of the tumour, and aggravate the disease. oo 1 Where the bowels are strangulated at the Navel, or at the Under Abdominal Aperture, it seems to me to be owing to the bowels being stretched, twisted, and inflamed, and forced into a part where there is a sufficient cavity for their recep- tion, and to their bulk being increased by an effusion of lymph upon their surface, between their coats, or within their cavity. 9th, That the strangulation at the Upper Abdominal Aper- ture may be occasioned either by the fascia of the transverse muscle, or bv a spasmodic contraction of the internal oblique muscles. If it is occasioned by the latter, it may be removed by those remedies which occasion great relaxation, as vene- section, fomentations, or the warm bath ; whereas, if a tendon be the course of the strangulation, such applications produce no good effect, tendons being incapable of relaxation or con- traction. 10th, That the tendinous columns of the external oblique muscle do not always separate from each other, so as to form the Under Abdominal Aperture at the same place: hence the tumour in an inguinal hernias has not always precisely the same situation; and if the smaller tendinous fibres which unite the larger tendinous columns be awanting, though the hernial tumour be truly a protrusion through the inguinal canal, it may have the same situation as a crural hernia. 11^4, That when the bowels are protruded through the in- guinal canal, and pass along the spermatic cord, these are di- rected obliquely downwards and inwards, in which situation they are covered by the cremaster muscle, and the membrane derived from the tendon of the external oblique muscle, which has been called the Superficial Fascia. 12^4, That as the inguinal apertures are extended in con- sequence of the bowels passing repeatedly through these, the Upper Inguinal Aperture may be so much enlarged, as to be brought immediately opposite to the Under Abdominal Aperture., and, in such a case, no part of the hernial tumour

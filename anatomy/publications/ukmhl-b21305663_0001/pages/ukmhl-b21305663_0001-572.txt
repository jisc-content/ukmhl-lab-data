ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 526 notice of Dr Hastings of Worcester, that ulceration of the villous coat of the pyloric extremity of the stomach does not impair the digestive powers of the stomach: hence the conclusion, that the cardiac extremity of the stomach is the principal seat of chymification. It is foreign to the object of an elementary treatise upon anatomy, to enumerate those substances which are with ease or difficulty converted into chyme. I shall, therefore, content myself by stating, that fat, ten- don, and unboiled vegetables, and unchewed portions of food, resist the action of the gastric juice, for a much longer time than portions of flesh which have been fully masticated. Pieces of bone, the entire seeds of fruits, or cherry stones, pass through the body unchanged. The reader will find much useful information on this subject in Mr Gosseâ€™s Ca- talogue ; the result of many experiments that author made upon himself, and which is worthy of the serious attention of the physician who is about to prescribe for a dyspeptic pa- tient. During the formation of chyme, a small portion of air is found within the stomach, which, according to C'hevreul, consists of Oxygen, - - 11.00 Carbonic acid, - - 14.00 Pure hydrogen, - - 3.55 Azote, - 71.45 100.00 SECTION IV. OF THE MEANS BY WHICH THE FOOD IS CONVERTED WITHIN THE STOMACH INTO CHYME. Of the Gastric Juice. Besides the mucus, the fluid called Gastric is found within the stomach.

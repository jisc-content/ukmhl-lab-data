335 LIGAMENTS OF THE PELVIS. SECTION V. OF THE LIGAMENTS OF THE PELVIS AND INFERIOR EXTREMITIES. OF THE LIGAMENTS OF THE PELVIS. What has been already stated respecting the ligaments of the superior extremities, applies also to those of the inferior extremities; and, in addition, it may be remarked, that the organic derangements of the ligaments of the inferior extremi- ties are of a more alarming nature than those of the superior. They more seldom yield, even to the most judicious treatment; and, besides, the general health is more apt to suffer materially, as they necessarily lead to confinement. The bones of the pelvis, which support the weight of the trunk of the body, and also serve as the basis on which the in- ferior extremities move, are firmly fixed to each other, by se- veral strong ligaments. The form of the bones of the pelvis contributes much to the firmness of it. The os sacrum, on account of the oblique direction of its articulating surfaces, is like a wedge placed between the ossa innominata; the extremities of each of which bones are arched forwards, and united at the symphysis pubis; hence the greater the depressing power, the more closely the bones of the pelvis are pushed together. Front View: The os sacrum is united to the fifth lumbar vertebra, and to the ossa innominata, by very strong ligaments, from which there is a ligament which sweeps along the upper aperture of the pelvis. There are small apertures in the above ligament for the passage of the lumbar nerves. The sacrum and ossa innominata arc also joined at the sacro-iliac symphysis by ligamento-cartilaginous substances,

ELEMENTS OF ANATOMY. 2 Animals arc of a more simple or complicated structure: hence, by examining the more simple, the structure and uses of the organs in the more complicated become obvious ; and we are thereby taught to analyse functions which in man are so complicated as otherwise to elude our research. The existence of an organ, under different modifications, or the want of it, in certain animals, cannot fail to suggest im- portant deductions as to the function of the same organ in the human frame ; and, at the same time, to shew that every part of the same organ is not equally sensible, and equally neces- sary to the prolongation of life. In short, the most striking illustrations and most remarkable discoveries as to the struc- ture and uses of the organs of man, as those of the circulation of the blood and the functions of the absorbent system, have been derived from a careful examination of the anatomy of the inferior animals. The study of the anatomy of the inferior animals is neces- sary to the understanding of the names applied to different organs of the human frame by the older anatomists, who di- rected their attention chiefly to the anatomy of the inferior animals. The anatomy of animals at large is the only sure basis upon which a natural Classification of animals can be built. A knowledge of the anatomy of the inferior animals may throw light on Geology. The bodies of animals are composed of Solids and Fluids, mixed in different proportions ; by the mutual action of which, the functions of the living body are performed. The solids give form and consistence to different parts of the body. The solids have the form of fibres or plates, of which mem- branes or cells are formed, destined to contain the fluids. The solids are the Bones, Ligaments, Muscles and Nerves. Anatomy, so far as it considers the solids, lias been di- vided into various branches, distinguished by different names, of Greek etymology, expressive of the parts referred to; as

Part IY.] 3S1 OF FISHES. FrogSf consists of a single Auricle and a Ventricle, which correspond with the right side of the Heart of warm-blooded Animals. The Auricle is commonlv larger than the Ventricle, but thinner in its walls. It , receives the Blood from the Body, and sends it to the Ventricle^ in the Mouth of which there are Valves, which vary in number in different Fishes. The Ventricle is sometimes round, at other times triangular, but more frequently of a tetragonal form. Its sides are generally thick, and have Columnje Carneas running in different directions. It opens first into a Bulh or Pedicle, which is very conspicuous in the Cod and Salmon, where it is of a pyramidal form. In the Skate, it has a cylindrical appearance. In this Animal and tlie Sturgeon, there are Valves at the entry, and also at the further extre- mity -[of the Pedicle. In the Cod, Salmon, See. the Valves are only at its origin. Principal Blood-vessels.—The distribution of the Blood-vessels differs considerably from that of the Animals of the preceding classes. They have a smaller proportion of red, but a much greater number of colourless Vessels. The Branchial Artery is conti- nued from the Pedicle, and is entirely spent upon the Gills. In the Skate, it advances under the Car- tilage which unites the inferior extremities of the Branchial Arches, and soon gives off a Branch to each side, that subdivides into three others, to be dispersed upon a corresponding number of Posterior Branchia?. The Trunk afterwards proceeds till it gets opposite to the two Anterior Branchiae, and then divides into a VoL. IV. X couple

OKGANS OF VOICE, &c. [Part IL The OF THE ORGANS OF VOICE AND RESPIRA TION i Hii Organs of Voice and Respiration in Rirds differ extremely from tliose of other Animals. The Larynx is peculiar in being double, or in there being one at each end of the Trachea. The Superior Larynx is situated at the I'oot of the Tongue and top of the Trachea, and is composed of several osseous Pieces, the largest of which is analogoui to the Cricoid Cartilage. There are neither Thyroid nor Arytenoid Cartilages, nor E}iiglottis, iii Birds. The Rima GlottkUs is a simple Chink or Slit, with Muscular sides, which can merely open and close the passage, having no connection W'ith the formation of Voice. In place of the E})iglottis, there are, in rnany Birds, Cartilaginous Papilla* upon the edge of the Glottis, to prevent the Aliment from going into the Lungs. In the Ostrich, there is a slight elevation, which some have considered as an Epiglottis. The Trachea, is composed of Cartilages or of Bone, which form complete rings, and these overlap each other at their edges in such a manner, that the diame- ter of the Tube is not affected by any twisting of the Neck. Its form is commonly cylindrical, sometimes co- nical, at other times it has dilatations and contractions, as in some of the Shimming' Birds.

189 OF MAMMALIA. Part I.^ appearance of two Horns, which open separately into the Vagina, as in the Hare and Rabbit.. 4. A Double Uterus with extraordinary lateral convo- lutions, or Uterus Anfractuosus^ as in the Opossum and Kangaroo. The Uterus of these Animals has several longitudinal folds, one of which runs through its whole length, and divides it into two equal parts. The Cor- nua Uteri, contracted at first, soon dilate into large Ca- vities, each of which sends out a narrow Fallopian Tube^ which is fixed to the extremity of the,Ovarium. From the corners of the Uterus, on each sliie, a Canal arises, which, after making a circuitous turn, approaches its fellow^, and terminates in the Vagina, by a narrow orifice, at each side of the iMeatus Urinarius. The Ovaria are as constant in the Female, as the Testes are in the Male. They are frequently situated- near the Kidneys, are of an oval form, and have the Ova buried in their substance. In the Pig, they are tuberculated; in the Hedge-hog, they are in the form of a cluster of grapes. The num- ber of the Ova corresponds with that of the yoUng, which the Female is capable of producing during her life. The structure of the Uterine Pubes is generally the Same as in the Human SptK'ies. In Uteri with Cornua, they are fixed to the latter, and are convoluted; but their diameter is always smaller than that of the Cornua. The Vaghia is a continuation of the Uterus, and lies in the same axis with tliat Organ. It is in proportion to the size of the Penis in the Male, and to that of the Foetus, which has to pass through it. It has generally Rugae running longitudinally, to favour its dilatation. In

OF THE BRAIN SG [Part I. Hic proportional breadth of the Brain to that of the Medulla Oblongata, Is, will) few exceptions, greater in Man than in other IVIainmalia, In Man, it is as 7 to 1; in Apes, from as 4 to 1 to as 5 to 1 ; in the Doff, as 11 to 6; in the Cat, as 11 to 4; in the Horse, as 21 to 84 in tJie Ox, as 13 to 5 ; in the Deer, as 5 to 2; in the Dolphin, as 13 to 1. The Falx of the Dura Mater, in IMannnalia, is smaller in proportion than in Man; the Hemispheres being less in danger of injuring each other. It is of different breadths in different Animals. In a few individuals of the class, as tJie Orniihorrpiichus and Porpoise, it is partly Osseous. The Tento- rium in Quadrupeds is proportionally broader tlian in Man; and in many, particularly the Carnivora, it contains in its substance a plate of Bone. In the Cat and Bear kind, this plate is in one piece; in the Hoi â€¢se, ^Off, and Seal, in three. The Osseous Tento- rium is commonly considered as obviating the effects of concussion, tliough it is found in some Animals of slow, as Avell as in those of quick motion. The Falx Minor is wanting in Quadrupeds. The other two Membranes of the Brain are similar to those in the Human Spe- cies. The form of the Brain varies in different Animals. In the Ape tribe, it is oval, as in Man ; in Carnivora, and some others, as the Hare and Babbit, it is narrower anteriorly ; others have the Cerebrum almost round. In the Dolphin, it is remarkable, in being twice as broad from one side to the other, as from before back- wards.

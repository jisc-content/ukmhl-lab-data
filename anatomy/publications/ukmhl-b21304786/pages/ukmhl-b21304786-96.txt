OF THE BRAIN, &c. [PAnr I. i)y after tlie ]\Iedu]lary Substance is dissolved by macera- tion, the remaining parts, by being inflated, appear like so many distinct Canals. The Third Pair goes through a hole ajjpropriated to it-, when there is no Sphenoid Fissure, either singly, or in company with some of the other Nerves of the Eve, and is distributed as in i\Ian. The Fourth, also, is as in Man. The Fifth, as in the Human Species, is also divided into three Branches, and these are larger or smaller, according to the form of the difierent parts of the Face. In Cai'nivorous Animals, as the Tiger^ the second and third portions of this Nerve appear to be uncommonly large. I’lie Sixth Pair, as in the Human Body, is bathed in Blood; and, while in the Cavernous Sinus, it is con- nected by one, two, or more Branches with the Great Sympathetic. ‘ U'hc Seventh, as in j\Ian, divides into the Portio Dui'a and Portio Mollis. The former differs according to the form and extent of the diflerent parts of the Face upon which it is dispersed. The Portio Mollis, as in Man, is entirely spent in the Labyrinth of the Ear. The Eighth and Ninth are dispersed nearly as in JMan. The Great Sympathetic Nerve has nearly the same connexion in the Cranium with the Fifth and Sixth Pail'S,—the same connexion in its course with the Nerves near it,—and forms the same kind of Ganglia, as in Man; only varying a little in the number of I'llamciUs sent off, or in tJie form of the Ganglia.

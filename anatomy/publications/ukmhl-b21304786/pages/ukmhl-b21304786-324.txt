In <318 OF THE EAU [Part IV. Cartilaginous Fishes, the outer set greatly exceed the inner in size. The length of the Osseous Canals varies in different Fishes ; part of them forms a sort of Pulley, over which the INlembranous Canals pass. The Membranous Canals vary also in length, but have in general the same kind of communication with the Vestible, and with each other, and form the same kind of Ampullae, as in Fishes of the Cartilaginous kind. Nerves corresponding with those in the Skate are also dispersed upon the Sac and Ampullae ; but the Nerves pass to the Labyrinth without perforating the Bones. OF THE NOSE. 1 HE Organ of Smelling is extensive in Fishes, though it has no connection with the Organs of Bespiration ; and is supposed to be acute, being a principal means by which they are enabled to search for their Food. The Nostrils, in Osseous Fishes, are generally divid- ed by a cross Membrane, wdiich gives the appearance of being double on each side. Some Muscular Fibres are found about the Nostrils, which admit of a small degree of dilatation or contraction occasionally, but the motion is not very evident.

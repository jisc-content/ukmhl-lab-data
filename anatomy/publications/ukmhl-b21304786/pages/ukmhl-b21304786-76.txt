70 OF TPIE MUSCLES [Part I. In Ruminants, this Muscle extends the Outer Toe, and the Extensor Indicis the Inner Toe. The Extensor Indicis Proprius, or Indicator, in MorJceys, sends a Tendon to the fore, and another* to the middle Finger. In Dogs and Cats, it is situated as in Man. In Solipeds and Ruminants, it is wanting. The Extensor Ossis Metacarpi Pollicis is similar, in Apes and many other clawed Animals, to that in Man. In Solipeds and Ruminants, it is fixed to the base of the Metacarpal Bone, and forms the Oblique Extensor of the Canon Bone. The Extensor Primi Internodii is present in Apes, Dogs, Cats, &c. The Extensor Secundi Internodii Pollicis is indistinct in Apes, and wanting in the Dog, Cat, &c. In Solipeds and Ruminants, the two last- named IMusoles are wanting. The Flexors of the Thumb, in clawed Quadrupeds, are somewhat similar to those in Man. In Ruminants, the Flexor Sublimis and Flexor Profundus of the Fin- gers send each two Tendons to the Toes. In Solipeds, there are two similar Muscles, but only a single Tendon to each, the one also perforating the other. MUSCLES OF THE POSTERIOR EXTRE- MITIES.

OF MAMIMALIA, Part I.] 9T from the edges of which the Retina arises, having Me- dullary Fibres in it, and these running chiefly in a transverse direction. The Foramen Centrale, of sjx)t seen in the Retina near the axis of the Human Eye, has been observed in several of tjie Ape tribe, where the Eyes are placed nearly in the same direction as in Man. The Lens, in all Quadrupeds, is divided into two spherical segments ; the posterior is generally the more convex of the two. In Man, tile I^ens is found to be proportionally the least and flattest. Of all other Mammalia, Blumexbach found it proportionally the greatest in the Opossum^ and the least in the Whale. In solne Quadrupeds, it is of a much rounder form than in the Human Body. In the Cetacea^ it is nearly spherical. The proportion of the axis to the diameter has been observed to be, in j\Ian and the Ape tribe, as 1 to 2; in the Dog, as 7 to 9; in the Horse, as 2 to S ; in the Ox, as 5 to 8; and in the Whale, as 13 to 15. The other Humours of the Eye have nothing par- ticular in them. The proportions of the three Hu- mours, the Aqueous, Crystalline, and Vitreous, mea- sured on the axis of the Eye, are in Man, 5, 4, 15; in the Dog, 5, 8, 8; in the //orjr, 9,16, 18; in the Ox, 5, 14, 18. 0/'the Muscles qf the Hpe.â€”Tliose in the Ape kind are the same as in Man. In other Quadrupeds, the Eye has a peculiar Muscle, tenned Suspensorius, wliiclt may assist the others according to the direction of its Fibres. It arises, with the straight Muscles, from the edge of the Foramen Opticum, and, running between \ or.. IV. R these

Part IL] S33 OF BIRDS. The Rmgs of the Trachea have no visible IMuscuIar Fibres, but only Membranes fixing them together; though in larger Birds, as the Cassoxoarij and Ontrichy they are observed to be covered with transverse Muscu- lar Fibres, from which it is presumed they exist in ail. The length of the Trachea varies in different Birds with that of the Neck. It sometimes differs in the twa) sexes of the same Species, especially in Biixls of the A- quatic kind, as is observed in tlie Male Wild Szoau, the Crane, and Indian Cock. In these, the Trachea makes large convolutions, partly without and partly within the Cavity of the Thorax, before entering the Lungs; yet there are no such turns in the Trachea of the He- ron, Sto7'k, Bittern, See. ; these, however, are not pro- perly Diving, but Wading Birds. The use ascribed to this structure is, to retain the in- spired air, and thus furnish a sufficient supply of Oxy- gen to the Animal while diving in deep water in search of prey, or flying in rarified air. These Convolutions have been compared to the wind- ings of a French Horn, and Birds possessing such a d'ra- chea are said to be fine singers. But this has been doubted, more especially as such a structure is not found in Singing Birds. The under end of the Trachea, or Inferior Glottis, or Vocal Organ, is formed of tense Membranes, and appears like the reed of a musical pipe. It is contract- ed into a narrow chink, and divided into two openings by a'slender slip of Bone, which goes from befoie back- ward. Sometimes it is formed by the angle made by the two Bronchi. 'i'he

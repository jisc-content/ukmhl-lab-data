2G0 [Part III.' OF THE BONES Tibia, is in general articulated directly with the Os Fe- nioris ; and in all, the Astragalus is joined to the Tibia, and the Os Calcis to the Fibula. Of the Serpents, one set move the under Jaw only, another set, viz. the Vipers and Venoinovs Serpents, move both Jaws. The Lower Jaw is articulated by a Glenoid Cavity, which corresponds with a Condyle of the Tem- poral Bone at the bottom of the Cranium. . Serpents, whether innoxious or poisonous, are divided according to the nature of their Teeth. The former have both Jaws beset with small Teeth in two i-ows, with an interval between them. In the Poisonous Species, the outer row in the upper Jaw is wanting, but their place is supplied by long hollow Tuslcs, which are con- nected with the Bag containing the poison, and serving as Excretory Ducts to convey it from the Glands at their roots, into the wound the Animal inflicts. The Tusks lie concealed in the Jaw, but can be darted ouL at the will of the Animal. In all the poisonous Ser- pents, the Tapper Jaw is moveable on the Cranium. This allows them to open the mouth widely, by which they are enabled occasionally to swallow an Animal en- tire, the diameter of which sometimes surpasses that of their OAVn Body. Serpents are remarkable for the number of their Ver- tebrcc, which form almost the whole Skeleton. They vary in number from about -30 to upwards of S50, and are nearly of the same form from the Head to the Tail. They arc connected by Ball and Socket. This articulation, however, is of such a nature as to allow fre^j motion laterally, but little in a vertical direction. . The

In the Tortoise and Lizards^ the Sac contains a quantity of chalky matter, which, in the Crocodile and some other Lizards^ is formed into three small, soft, stony concretions; and there is a kind of Cochlea formed by a prolongation of the Sac. It is of a conical form, is slightly curved, has a Cartilaginous partition divid- ing it into a double Canal, and is something similar to that in Birds. There is a vestige of it also in Ser- pents. In the Frog., Toad, and Salamander, the Sac contains also a Cretaceous Matter. The Membranous Labyrinth has many Blood-vessels, which are very visible in some of the large Reptiles. It has also Nerves which are analoe-ous to the Portio O Mollis in Man, and these are plentifully dispersed upon the Sac and the Ampullae. OF THE NOSE. The Organ of Smell is less extensive in Reptiles than in the former classes. Some have two or three Cartila- ginous Eminences, covered by the Schneiderian Mem- brane ; others merely a thickening of that INIembrane. These eminences are somewhat analogous to the Con- chae of warm-blooded Animals, and divide the Cavity of the Nose into so many Fossulae; but they have no . Osseous Laminae.

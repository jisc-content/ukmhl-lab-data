Hydatids immersed in warm water, immediately after being obtained from a living Animal, are observed to have a contractile power, but they have no external opening. They are of different sizes and kinds; most commonly there is either one or more Hydatids floating in the same Cyst. Each con- sists of two Coats, the inner of which is extremely de- licate. Neither of them possesses any visible Blood-ves- sels, thougR the Sac containing them has abundance of Vessels, Nerves, &c. derived from those of the Organ with which it is connected. Hydatids ought not to be con- founded with watery Vesicles, connected occasionally with the Kidney, &c. which are not inclosed in Cysts, ha\â€™e no small Hydatids adhering to their inner surface, and want contractility. In other Animals, a Hydatid is found, with a Head and Mouth, by which it adhei es to the inner surface of the Sac w hicli incloses it. In the Ijcech^ the Sexes are double in each individual, and they have reciprocal copulation. The Male parts consist of two Testes, each formed of a convoluted Duct. A short Vas Deferens, ending in a kind of Pe- nis, is observed at tlie under side, near the anterior ex- tremity. In the vicinity of this there is a Vagina, wdiich seems to receive the Penis of the other individual. The Lumhrici Intcstinorum have distinct Sexes. In the Male, a thread-like Vessel, four or five times the length of the Animal, much convoluted, but easily un- ravelled, composes the Testes. This forms a Vesicula Seminalis, which is equal to upwards of a third part of the length of the Body, and is .sometimes nearly as large as a crow-quill, full of a milky liquor. The Vesicula ends

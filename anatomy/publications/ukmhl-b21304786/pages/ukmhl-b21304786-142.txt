In the Seal, and other Amphibious Quadrupeds, a large Ilio-lumbar Artery from the Aorta sends out the Hy- pogastric, the Aorta afterwarcs dividing into two Ar- teries which correspond with the Femorals. Cetaceous Animals, destitute of a proper Pelvis, have the Aorta divided into two portions, which supply the postei'ior parts of the Body. The Vems have the same general distribution as in Man; and in some parts, particularly in the Pelvis, they are observed to vary less than the Arteries. The Valves of the Veins Correspond in Animals in general, with few' exceptions. In some Quadfujieds, as the Horse, Dr Haller found Valves at the origin of the Mesenteric and Haemorrhoidal Veins, and in those of the Spleen ; and in the Dog and Sheep, he met with them in the Pulmonary Veins. The Pulmonary Veins, like their corresponding Ar- teries, vary in the number of their principal Branches, corresponding with that of the Lobes of the Lungs. 'J he most singular appearance among the Veins is found in the Foot of the Horse, where they form an intricate Plexus, which completely covers the surface of the Coffin Bone. In some Animals, as the Seal, there is a remark- able distribution of the Veins of the Kidney, which form a Net-work, that is expanded over the surface of that Organ. In several of the Amphibious Quadrupeds, and in

Part I.] OF MAMMALIA. 69 tensors are complicated, and of great strength, corre- sponding with the purposes required in their progres- sive motion. In the Cetacea^ where the two Bones of the Fore-arm are not moveable upon the Humerus, the Triceps is wanting. But the Anconeus is present in all the Animals mentioned above. f Muscles of the Hand.—Apes have Supinators similar to those in Man. The Dog and Cat have the Supina- tor Brevis, but the Longus is wanting. They are both wanting in Solipeds, Ruminants, and Bellucc. The Pronators are the same in Apes and Carnivora as in Man. Solipeds and Ruminants have no Pronators. The number of Flexors and Extensors of the Hand is nearly the same in Monheps, and other clawed Quadru- peds, as in Man. In Quadrupeds with a Canon Bone, the Extensor Carpi Radialis is inserted into the fore part of the Base of that Bone, which it extends; and the Flexor Carpi Iladialis is inserted into the back part of the Base. The Flexor Ulnaris and Extensor Ulna- ris are fixed to the Bone that corresponds to the Os Pi- siforme. The three last Muscles are Flexors in these Animals. Mmcles of the Fingers.—The Extensor Digitorum Communis, in Quadrupeds with four Fingers or Toes independent of the Thumb, has four Tendons, in Ru- minants two, in Solipeds only one. The Extensor Pro- prius Digit! Minimi, in Mmlceys, sends Tendons to the fifth and fourth Fingers; in Dogs and Bears, to the fifth, fourth, and middle Fingers. In Solipeds, there are two Extensors fixed to the first Phalanx of the Toe. E 3 In

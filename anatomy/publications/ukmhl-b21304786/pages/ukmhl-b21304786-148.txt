OF THE LARYNX, &c. [Part L 142 ed together by Cellular Substance, but do not commu- nicate with each other, except through the medium of the Larynx. Many of the other Jpes and Baboons^ though not the whole, have also in their throats large single or double Sacs of different forms, communicating with the La- rynx by one or two Foramina, between the Os Hyoides and Thyroid Cartilage. These Sacs vary in size in dif- ferent individuals, and become larger as the Animal ad- vances in years. During respiration, part of the air enters these, w'liich in time of crying are dilated, but can afterwards collapse by tbe pressure of the surround- ing Muscles. It is supposed by some, that the voice of these Animals is rendered proportionally weak, from part of the air getting into the Sacs. In the American MonKeys, the Arytenoid Cartilages are diminutive, and turned back ; the Cuneiform Carti- lages, and Cellular Substance, on each side, form anteriorly a cushion, which touches its fellow; and, -with the other parts of the Larynx, they compose a strait passage, turned like an which gives the flute-like Voice in the Whistling Monkeys. The Holding Apes have the anterior part of the Os Hyoides formed into a spherical cavity, by which the* tones are produced that are heard at a gi'eat distance. The principal differences in the Larynx, among the other orders of this class, are the following: In the Ant-eater^ which is observed to be dumb, Bm- MEXBACH found the Larynx entirely Osseous. In the Ornithormjnckus, each of the Ventricles has only one Ligament of the Glottis. Among

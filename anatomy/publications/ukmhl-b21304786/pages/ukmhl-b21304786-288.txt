C)]{GANS OF VOICE, &c. [Part III. S82 OF THE ORGANS OF VOICE AND RES FIR A TION i. HE Lanjnx of Reptiles, like the Superior Lary nx in liirds, is coniposctl of different pieces ; but the appear- ance varies in. different kinds of Reptiles, and some- times in the different sexes of the same Species. There is no Inferior Larynx in this class. Reptiles have neither Epiglottis nor Papillae, though, in the Crocodile, tliere are the rudiments of the former. 'I'he Larynx of the Crocodile has five Cartilages enter- ing into its composition. The Glottis is purely Mem- hranous.

The Males of some Species of Frogs have one or two Sacs, cither in the Throat or Cheeks, which they inflate, in time of copidation, by means of a Fora- men near the chink of the Larynx, opening into each of the Sacs. Here, also, the Rima Glottidis is larger, and the I'rachea longer, than in the Female. 'I'he Trachea, in Reptiles in general, is formed of Cartilaginous

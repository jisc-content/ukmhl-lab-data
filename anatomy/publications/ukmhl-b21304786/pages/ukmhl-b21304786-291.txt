OF REPTILES. Part III.] the OF rilE ALUIENTARY CANAL. Here, as in Birds, the Viscera of the Abdomen are in the same Cavity with those of the Thorax; of course, the Peritoneum and Pleura are blended together. The former Membrane differs from the latter in Reptiles, in being sometimes of a black colour. The Diaphragm is wanting. The Alimentary Canal is very similar to that in Birds. The Pharynx and E- sophagus are nearly of the same diameter, and are wider, in proportion to the size of the Stomach, than in the two former classes, and are rendered still wider than at first sight they appear to be, by being full of Ruga?, which vanish when the Animal swallows. The Esophagus of the Turtle is covered with long pointed Papillse, of a white colour and firm consistence, and turned towards the Stomach, as if to prevent the Food from returning. In the Lizard tribe, the Stomach is of a globular form. In the Crocodile in particular, it resembles that of the Gizzard of Gi'anivorous Birds, in the closeness of its orifices, and thickness of its substance. The Esophagus of ISerpents is of great size, as they frequently swallow Aihmals larger than themselves, and often retain them there for days or weeks, allowing them to pass to the Stomach by slow degrees. The proportional length of the Intestinal Canal, com- pared with the Bodies of Reptiles, is still less than in-

{PAilT I, OF THE STOMACH 15i Of of the Upper and Teeth of' the Under Jaw, assisted by a twist of the Head, tears it across. After a slight mas- tication, the Aliment passes into the Paunch, and from that, by small portions, into the second Stomach. "VVlien a considerable quantity lias been swallowed, a morsel is thrown back with velocity from the Stomach into tlie Mouth, where it is accurately ruminated, and then carried directly to the third Stomach, the groove being contracted between this and the two fli'st. This Pi’ocess is continued till the whole of the Food has un- dergone the same operation. In the tliird and fourth Stomachs, a more complete digestion takes place. J'he Stomachs of the other Horned Rummants differ little in their nature from that of the Ox. In the Deer, the Paunch has three Pouches appearing externally, and the Papilla; are less conspicuous than in the Ox. In the Dromedary, Camel, and Lama, there are four Stomachs, as in Horned Rummants, but the structure is different. In the Camel and Lama, there are nume- rous Cells in the substance of the first and second Sto-- machs, formed by sta'ong Muscular Bands crossing eacli other at right angles. By the action of the.se, it is sup-- posed the Animals can open or contract at pleasure the mouths of the Cells, which serve as Reservoirs of the drink, so as to expel the contained fluids, or retain them even for several days. The water they take in is' observed to be rendered turbid in the first Stomach, by the mixture with the Food, but becomes pure in the second. After rumination, the Animal can draw the- third Stomach to the Esophagus, and receive the rumi- ifatccl I'ood, without polluting the water in the Cells. ‘

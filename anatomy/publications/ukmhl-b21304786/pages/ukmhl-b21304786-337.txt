OF FISHES Part IV.] 231 the Body, the contained Air is considered to be con- densed, by which the Animal can sink ; or, by a relax- ation of these parts, the Bag can be dilated, so as to allow the Fish to rise again at pleasure. The Cavi- ty of the Air-bag is commonly uniform, but sometimes divided by Septa, as in the Silurus, or Cellular, as in the Porcupine Fish. Its sides also vary much in thick- ness and strength in different Fishes. Upon the inner side of this Sac, in the different Species of Gadus, as Cod, Haddoch, &c. a Gland is situated, which has a lobulated structure; and in the Eel, there are two, from which the contained Air is supposed to be secreted. In the Sea Perch, there is also a Gland, but, besides this, there are two others on the outside of the Bag, from which numerous Vessels containing Air arise, and unite into a Trunk that opens into the Sac. In other Fishes, no similar Organs are^ found, but Vessels are observed on the inside of the Sac, which seem to secrete Air to answer the same purpose. The Air-bag generally communicates by one, and sometimes by more Ducts of various lengths, with the middle part of the Esophagus, or of the Stomach, though more frequently with the former. Sometimes, as in the Herring, it ends in tlic bottom of the Stomach. In some, as the Sturgeon, it communicates with the Sto- mach without the intervention of a Tube; and here, as also in the Salmon, there is a Sphincter Muscle, which may act as a Valve. Where a Sphincter is not found, the Muscular P'ibres of the Organ in which the Tube

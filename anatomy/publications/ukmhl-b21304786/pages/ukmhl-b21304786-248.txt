242 OF THE ALniENl'ARY CANAL [Part II. tiiuil (’anal is much sliortcr than In Mammalia. It varies from twice to five times the length of the Animal. In the Ostrich, on the contrary, it is found to be between twenty and thirty times the length. 'I he Canal is also shorter and narrower in- Carnivorous Birds than in those living on vegetable Food, yet many Fish-eaters liave it etjually extensive. In all Birfls, there is a distinction into small and great Intestines, though, to external appearance, the difference is very inconsiderable. The small Intestines are commonly longer than the great, as in Mammalia; but sometimes shorter, as in the Ostrich. The situation, form, and structure of the Intestines, is nearly the same in the greater number of Birds. The Duodenum begins near the termination of the Eso- phagus, but there is a prominence, in some, as the com- mon Fowl, between the two openings, which may prevent the Food from escaping till properly digested. The Gut hangs loose, in the common Fowl, towards the right side of the Abdomen, the rest of the small Tn- testines making turns, and uniting themselves to each othci’. The Intestines are destitute of Valvula? Conni- , ventes in Birds in general ; but in many, there is a Villons appearance in them. There are commonly two Intcstina Ca'ca in Birds, a few of the A(]uatic kind excepted, which have only one. The Caeca arc inserted at the sides of the termination of the Ilium. They are generally smaller at their base, and enlarge towards their shut extremities. They lie parallel to the small Guts, and contain the same kind of Aliment witli them.

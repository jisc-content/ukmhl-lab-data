89 OF MAMMALIA. Part I.] Of the Cerebral Nerves. There is nothing very particular in the origins of the Cerebral Nerves within the Cranium, excepting the Ol- factory. These, in the tribe only, resemble those in Man. In other Quadrupeds, they form two large Emi- nences, termed Mammillares, which are chiefly of a Cineritious nature, and fill the Fossa of the Ethmoid Bone. They are remarkable for their size in Herbivo- rous Animals. Each contains a Cavity, which commu- nicates with the anterior part of the Lateral Ventricle of that side by a small passage; of course, there are six Ventricles in proper Quadrupeds. This circumstance gave rise to the ancient opinion, of the first pair of Nerves conducting the Pituita from the Brain to the Nose. The number of the Nerves from the Brain is the same as in Man. They vary chiefly according to the form and extent of the parts on which they are dis- From the First Pair, numerous Fibrillae come off, to be distributed upon the different parts in the upper por- tion of the Nose. In the Sheep, there is also a Branch, arising, within the Cranium, from the upper part of the Trunk of the Nerve. In the Dolphin and Porpoise, the Olfactory Nerve is entirely wanting. The Optic Nerves are conjoined as in Man, but they appear to be still more intimately incorporated. In large Animals, the Fibrillm composing these Nerves are so separated from eacli other by the Pia Mater, that after

PART VIII. OF WORM S. W oRMs differ from the former class of Animals, in having no Antennse, and being destitute of Members. In same Worms are bard parts, forming a sort of Jaws or Teeth. Some have Lateral Jaws. The Lumbrici have none. The Aphrodite has four Teeth and a Pro- boscis, which it can extend or retract at pleasure. The Leech has three semicircular projecting Teeth, of a Cartilaginous nature, with sharp denticulated edges, with which it pierces the Skin. In a large Species of Nereis, the entry into the Esophagus has eight Calca-. reous pieces in place of Jaws and Under Lip. Worms possess a distinct Epidermis, but scarcely any thing that can be called a Cutis. Several, as the Ajjhro- dite, Lumbricus, &c. are partly or entirely covered with Hairs, or Bristles, or Spines, or Tubercles, &c. which assist them in crawling, being destitute of Feet. Some, as the -Intestinal Worms, are covered with a Slime which may exude from the surface of their Skin. They have two kinds of Muscles for performing their different motions, one consisting of four Fasciculi, two above.

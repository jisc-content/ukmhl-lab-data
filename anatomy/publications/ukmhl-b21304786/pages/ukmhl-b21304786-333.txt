After the water has been received by the Mouth, from this it is sent to the Galls, which expand, by the action of Muscles peculiar to them, in such a manner as to have it freely applied to their surface ; in conse- quence of which, Fishes derive Oxygen from water, as breathing Animals do from the Air in their Lungs. But the water does not return by the jMoutli: it’is dis- charged by the Branchial openings, in which case Fishes differ from the former class, in not expiring through the same passage by which they inspire.

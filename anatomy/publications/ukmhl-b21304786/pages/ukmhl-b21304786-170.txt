[Part I. OF 1'HE INTESTINES I(j4 The Peritoneum and IMesentery exist in all Vertebral Animals, of course in the different Animals of this class, and are nearly of the same nature as in the Hu- man body, the ^lesentery being longer or shortei’, and. running in a sti’aight, or an oblique, or in a circular direction, according to the length and course of the Intestines. In many Quadrupeds, it is longer than in INIan, partly owing to the depth and length of the Ab- domen. ^ Of the Anus and its Muscles.—In IVIammalia and Birds, the Anus is placed at the posterior extremity of the 'rrunk of the Body, directly under the origin of the Tail, and generally in a direction opposite to the Mouth. In almost all Mammalia, it is a simple ori- fice, which only gives passage to the Faeces. In the Sloth and Beaver, the Rectum and Urethra have a com- mon termination. In the Ornithorrynclms, the end of the Rectum is I'emarkable, for dilating into a Bag, which receives the Faeces, Urine, and the Sexual evacua- tions. The following numbers represent nearly the proper- tional length of the Intestinal Canal to that of the Body, in a few of the Mammiferous Animals mentioned in this work, the measurement being in a straight line from the Nose to the Anus. Taking the length of the Body as 1, that of the Intestines is as follows:—In the Ape tribe, varying from 6 to 8 ; in the Sloth, 3 to 1; Ant-eater,^', Armadillo, ?>', OrnithorryncliiLS, h \ Bat, 3; Scpdrrel, Rat,8-, Guinea Pi^, 16; Wild Bab- hit, 11; Tame Babbit, 9; Beaver, 9 ; Hedge-hog, 6 ; Mole,

Part IX.] OF ZOOPHYTES. the pi, the Vessels which carry the nourishment come di- rectly or indirectly from the Stomach. In the Hydra, or Polypus with simple Arms, no Ves- sels are observed ; they Imbibe their nourishment by means of the Pores of their Gelatinous covering; and even when their Body is inveiled, their external, now becoming an internal surface, is found to digest their Food equally well with the other. Tlie Monadvs, Protecs, and other Microscopical A- nimals, are found to be the most simple of any, ap- pearing to be mere Gelatinous Masses, destitute of Mouth and Stomach, and receiving their nourishment through the surface of their Body. The Rotifera, Vorticella, and some other equally minute Animals* however, are observed to have a Stomach. Organs of Respiration.—The Vessels seen on the sur- face of the Animals of the order EeMnodermata, as the Echinus, and the soft Gelatinous Zoophytes, as the Me- dusa, are supposed by some Authors to draw in nou- rishment from without, and to serve also as a sort of Respiratory Organs; but these are circumstances not yet fully ascertained. The fresh-water Polypi, or Zoo- phytes strictly so called, imbibe nourishment through their whole surface. Of the order Infusoria, or Animalcula if Iirfusions, their diminutive size renders it impossible to ascertain any thing about their nature. Alimentary Canal and Cavity.—In some of the indi- viduals of the class, there is an Alimentary Canal be- ginning by a Mouth, and terminating by an Anus. In others there is a Sac, .simple or complex.

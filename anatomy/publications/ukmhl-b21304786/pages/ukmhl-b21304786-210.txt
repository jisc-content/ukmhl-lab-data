OF THE BONES 201' [Paet II. The Bones in the Wings of the Penguins are remark, able for tlieir flattened appearance, and form a sort of medium between the W^ing of the Bird and the Fin of the Fish. In the Lower Extremities, there is an Os Femoris, a Tibia, and a Fibula, which is soon anch^^^losed to the Tibia, and does not reach its Lower Extremity; a Rotula, the place of which is often supplied by a Process of the Tibia, as in Diving Birds; one Bone supplying the place of Tarsus and Metatarsus; and the Toe.s, the Bones of which are more numerous, the more exterior- 13' they are placed. The Toes are articulated upon a Pulley, formed by the lower end of the Metatarsal Bone. The inner side has a small Bone, that supports the Pos- terior 'I'oe or Pollex. There are two Bones to the Pollex, three to the Second Toe, four to the Third Toe, and five to the Fourth. In Birds wdth only three Toes, the First Toe has three, the Second four, and the Third Toe five Bones. The Cassoioary has only three Toes, and the Ostrich two. The Birds with four Toes have commonly three before, and one behind. Some, as the Parrot, Cuckoo, &c. have two before and two behind. Swimming Birds, as the Penguin, have the Pollex obliterated. In wading and other long-limbed Birds, the length of the Leg is produced by the 'Hbia, and the Bone which supplies the place of Tarsus and Metatarsus; and is often in proportion to that of the Neck, though there are many exceptions. The Lower Extremities of Birds in general, are placed so much behind the common centre of gravity, as to make the Animal ap- pear

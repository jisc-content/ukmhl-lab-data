[Part I. UG OF THE LARYNX, &c. OF are connected by a cross Slip; in others they are at a distance from each other, and without any connexion. In the Cetacea Mr Hunter did not find the Thyroid Gland. Cuvier, however, detected it in the Dolpliiuy where it was divided into two portions, which w'ere at a distance from the Larynx,, and near the anterior ex- tremity of the Sternum. Trachea:â€”This presents, in general, the same struc- ture as in the Human Body but the number of the Bronchi vai'ies with that of the Lobes of the Lungs. There is great variety in the number, form, and ex- tent of the Cartilaginous Rings of the Trachea. They approach nearer to a circle in Quadrupeds than in Man; the opening behind, therefore, is proportionally .smaller. Many of the GUres have rings almost complete. In some of the Ferce, as the Bear^ Lion, &c. they form about three-fourtlis of a circle. Among other Animals, as the Ox, the extremities of the Cartilages meet behind in an acute angle. In a few, as the Lama, Seal, Lamanthi, Dolphin, and' Porpohe, the Cartilages of the Trachea, and of the beginnings of the Bronchi, are observed to form a com-' plete circle.

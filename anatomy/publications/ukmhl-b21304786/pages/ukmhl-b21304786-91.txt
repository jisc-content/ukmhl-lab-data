OF MAMMALIA. Part I.] â€¢85 rent stales of fatness and leanness of the Animal; but, taking things in a very general way, it is found that small Animals have the Brain largest in proportion. The largest Brain Soemmerring found in the Horse weighed 1 lb. 4 oz. while the smallest in Man was 2 lb. 5^ oz.; yet the Nerves in the former were ten times larger than those in the latter. Dr Monro found the Brain in the Ox only one-fourth the weight of that of the Human Brain, while the weight of the Body of the former was six times greater than that of the latter; or, the Human Brain is twenty- four times greater in proportion to the weight of the Body, than that of the Ox. In Man, at different times of life, its weight varies from a 22d in a young person, to a 35th of the Body in a Subject advanced in life. In the Ourang-outang, it is a 48th; in other Apes, it varies from a 22d to upwards of a 100th ; in the Mouse, it is a 41st; in the Rat, a 76th; in the Hare, a 228th; in the Mole, a 36th; in the Hog, from a 47th to a 305th; in the Cat, a 94th; in the Bear, a 265th ; in the Horse, a 400th ; in the Ox, an 860th; in the Hog, from a 412th to a 512th ; in the Dolphin, from a 25th to a 102d ; in the Porpoise, a 91st. The proportion which the Cerebrum bears to that of the Cerebellum is as follows: In Man, as 6 to 1; in Apes, from as 6 to 1 to as 14 to 1 ; in the Mouse, as 2 to 1 ; in the Rat, as 3f to 1 ; in the Hare, as 6 to 1; in the Mole, as 4^ to 1; in the Dog, as 8 to 1 ; in the Cat, as 6 to 1; in the Horse, as 7 to 1 ; in the Ox, as 9 to 1 ; in the Sheep, as 5 to 1.

[Part L OF THE BONES 56 of this family, the Bones of the Leg and Tliigh are much shorter than those of the Fore-arm and Hu- tuerus. Jn the Rat and Mole, the Tibia and Fibula form one continued Bone for a considerable part of their length. In the Rodentia, the Fibula is placed entirely behind the Tibia; also in the Dog, where the two Bones are attached through their whole length. In the Hoi'se, the Fibula is only a Rudiment anchy- losed by age to the upper part of the Tibia. In Ru- minants, it is wanting. In the Pig and Elephant, the Fibula is anchylosed throu"h its whole length to the Tibia. Tarsus.—In Quadrupeds w'ith Toes, the Tarsal Bones have a near resemblance to diose in Man; they differ only in a few particular circumstances. In Mon- keys, strictly sq called, the ‘Os Calcis generally wants the Tuberosity of the Heel, at its Posterior Extremity; and the Tarsus is articulated w’ith the Leg Bones, in such an oblique manner, that the Foot rests more on its outer edge than on the Sole. In some of the Lemurs, the Os Calcis and Os Scaphoides are so long, as to give the Foot the appearance of a Hand. In Carnivora, the Ginglymus at the lower end of the Tibia is more complete than in Man. The Heel is longer, and cpiite straight, in those that walk only on the Toes. In the Mole, the Tibia alone is articulated with the Tareus. RocJenfia have the Os Calcis much elongated. Jn some Animals, as the Opossum and Heaver, the Tarsus has a Supernumerary Bone on its inner side. SoTipedf^

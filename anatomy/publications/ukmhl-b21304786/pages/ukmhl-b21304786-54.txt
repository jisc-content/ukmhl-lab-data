48 [Pakt 1 OF THE BONES The The Ferce have the Abdominal Surface of the Osstt Ilia turned towards the Spine. They are nearly as broad behind as before, and are hollow externally. In the Mole^ tlie Ossa Innomlnata are almost cylindrical, and so close together, that the Parts of Generation are situated on the Abdominal side of the Brim of the Pel- vis. The BeaVf which rests much on its Buttocks, has the Pelvis more similar to that in man, than in many others. In the Otter and Sealy it is similar to that of other Carnivora. In the Solipedsy the Ossa Ilia are large, and the Ossa Ischia short. The Acetabula, as in many other Quadrupeds, correspond with the posterior third part of the length of the Ossa Innominata. The Symphysis Pubis is remarkable for its length; and, in old Animals, is frequently Anchylosed. In the larger RuminantSy as the Oar, the Ilia are of great breadth. In the more diminutive species, they are proportionally smaller. The external surface is con- cave. Among the Belhia;, the Pelvis of the Pig is similar to that of the Ferae, but the Ossa Ischia go farther back, and the Notches of the Ilia extend farther into the Bones. 4 he Elephant and Rhinoceros have broad Ossa Ilia; the Abdominal Surface is concave, the Pel- vis is of enormous size, and the Symphysis Pubis of great length. 'I he Cetacea have no Pelvis, except two thin flat Bones, suspended in the flesh of the back part of the Belly, and side of the Anus, and somewhat analogous to flic Ossa Pubis.

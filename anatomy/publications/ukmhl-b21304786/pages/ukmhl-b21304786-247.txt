The Parroquet, and some other Birds, are observed to chew the cud like Ruminant Quadrupeds. Fowls, Geese, &c. having hard and callous Stomachs, are termed Spurious Ruminating Birds. Carnivorous Birds.

In the Hazok kind, the Esophagus is so wide, as to be considered by some a kind of Câ€™rop ; and so large is this passage in some Fish-eaters, that whole Animals are contained in it till the Stomach can receive them. The structure of the Stomach of these Birds differs much from that of the plurality of Stomachs in the former kinds, being merely a I^lusculo-membranous Sac. 'I he Food,' too, is here more easily digested. But there are many intermediate links in the diversified structure of Stomachs in the Animals of this class. - Most Piscivorous Birds want the Crop; when this is the case, the Infundibulum is larger, as if' to supply its place. The Pylorus, in Birds, has no Sphincter. The Intes- VoL. IV. Q tinal

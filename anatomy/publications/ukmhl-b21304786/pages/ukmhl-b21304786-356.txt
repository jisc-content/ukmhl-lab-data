[Part V ^ 350 OF MOLLUSCA, such strength, tliat llie Animal masticates other Testa- cca, upon which it lives. The Anus, in the Mollusca, varies considerably in situation among the different Ge- nera or Species. In the Cuttle-Fish, it is at the fore part of the Neck; in the Slvg and Snail, close to the Air-hole; in the Limpet, it is upon the top of the Head ; and in the Jcephala in general, opposed to the Mouth. The Liver, in the different Mollusca, is commonly large in proportion ; it has no Vena Portae ; it receives its Blood from the Aorta, and returns it by Veins to the Cava. In the Cephalopoda, the Liver is a brown mass, situated near the Head, and extending into the Abdomen. In the Sepia Loligo, the Bag which pro- duces the ink is situated on the Liver, and sends out a Duct, which terminates near the end of the Rectum. In the Sepia Officinalis, the Ink-bag is situated between the Lobes of the Liver, and in the Sepia Octopus, at a distance from them. In these Animals, according to CuviRK, the Liver sends Bile of an orange colour, by two Ducts, into the Gizzard. The contents of the Ink- bag are supposed to be discharged by the action of the large Muscular Sheath of the Body of the Animal, and serve to render the surrounding element bitter, when the Creature is in danger of being attacked by an ene- my. The Gasteropoda have a large Liver, divided into liobes, which send out a number of Ducts that sur- round the Alimentary Canal, and terminate in the In- testines. In the Slug, the transparent Blood-vessels form a border, which is conspicuous on the dark-co- loured Liver. In many of the Snail kind, the Liver, with

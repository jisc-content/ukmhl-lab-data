OF THE HEART, &c. [Part IV. In the SK-ate kind, tlie Absorbents are proportionally much larger, conipaiâ€™cd with their Rlood-vessels, than in the former classes. They liave frequent communications w'lth each other, and often by transverse Canals; but in place of form- ing Thoracic Ducts, they unite into Right and Left Plexus, which go to the corresponding sides of the Body. The principal Absorbents of the Chylopoietic Viscera run near the large Branches of the Coeliac and Mesen- teric Blood-vessels, and the principal Lymphatics of the Assistant Chylopoietic Viscera attend the larger Ves- sels belonging to these parts. Besides the Plexus which these form, there is one of a singular nature on the Curvature of the Stomach ; it has a Cellular or Cavernous appearance, which does not occur in any other part of the Body. Into the Visceral Plexus all the other Absorbents of the Body pass ; the I.ymphatics of the inferior parts, and of the Organs of Urine and Generation, run up to them. Those of the Trunk go inwards, and those of the Head, Heart, and Gills, form chiefly a single Trunk, which descends. From these Plexus, a Trunk in each side of the Body ends in the Subclavian Vein at the joining with the Internal Jugular, where the fluids are prevented from returning by a pair of Valves. In the Cod, Salmon, and other Osseous Fishes, there are five principal \ essels, which are more conspicuous than the rest; one runs directly along the middle of the Belly, froni the Anus to the Head, and receives the Lymphatics from the parts of the Body near it; another along

OF REPTILES. Part III.] 26S Muscle, analogous to the Quadratus Lumborum, lying under the Dorsal Shell, and moving the Os Ilium ; and another, supplying the place of a Rectus Abdominis, arising from the posterior extremity of the Abdominal Shell, and fixed to the Pubes. Of the Muscles ot the Thigh, there are different Adductors. A Muscle from the Pubes is fixed to the small Trochanter, and holds the place of the Iliacus and Psoas. One INIuscle arises from the Spine, and two from the Pubes, Adiich corre- spond to the Glutei. A Muscle analogous ,to the Ob- turator Interims arises from the Ilium, and is fixed to the gi'eat Trochanter. The Muscles of the Leg are analogous to the Semi-membranosus, Semi-tendinosus, and Sartorius. T'here is an Extensor, a Rectus, and two Bicipitcs. One remarkably thin INIuscle arises from the Coccyx, and passes under the Skin of the Exti'e- mitj to its insertion, nearly opposite the Heel. It bends the Leg, and extends the Foot. In the Sea Tortoise, the Muscles of the Foot, and also of tiie Toes, are chiefly Aponeurotic. In the Frog, few Muscles belong to the Spine. A iMuscle analogous to the Coccygeus draws the Coccyx into the same direction wâ€™ith the Spine. There is a sort of Sacro-lumhalis, which is fixed to the Transverse Processes of the Vertebrae, and extends as far as the Head; an Ohliquus Superior, a Rectus Anterior, and Intertransversales. T he Abdominal Muscles, on account of the want of Ribs, are inserted into the Sternum. There are few Muscles belonging to the Plead; most of those inserted R 4 intf?

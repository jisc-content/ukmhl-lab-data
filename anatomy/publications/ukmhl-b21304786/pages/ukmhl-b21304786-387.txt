381 Part IX.] OF ZOOPHYTES, The The Holotliuria has a large Mouth, surrounded by semi-osseous Plates, which serve chiefly for the attach- ment of Muscles and Tentacula. Round the Mouth are Sacs, which open into it, and are supposed to dis- charge a kind of Saliva. ' ‘ The Monades^ and other Microscopical Animals, ap- pear to be extremely simple, having neither any appa- rent Mouth nor Stomach. They seem to be Gelatinous masses, nourishing themselves by imbibing from their surface. Nervous System.—No distinct Nervous System has yet been found in this class of Animals. In the Echinus, nothing has been seen which bears any resemblance to Nerves. In the Asterias are parts, something similar to them, round the Esophagus. There is a soft white circle, from which Filaments run to each of the Branches of the Animal, and also to the Stomach. Something of a similar nature is seen in the Holothuria. Between the different pairs of longitudinal Muscles, a white cord appears, marked with the zig-zag lines seen in the Nerves of other Animals, and seeming also to encircle the Esophagus. No appearance of Nerves has been detected either in the Medusa or the Actinia. In the Hydra, or Polypus with Arms, and also in Animals the productions of infusion, there is nothing like Nerves, yet they are sensible of heat, d'hey prefer light to darkness, and have so far the sensation of Touch, as to feel the agitation of the water that sur-* rounds them.

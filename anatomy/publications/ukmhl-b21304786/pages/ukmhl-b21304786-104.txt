[Part I. 98 OF THE EYE tliese and the Ball, is fixed to the Sclcrotis a little be- hind the insertion of the Recti Muscles. In the Horse and Ruminants, it is in the form of a Funnel; but in the greater part of Carnivora, and in the Cetacea, it forms four distinct Muscles. In the Rhinoceros, it is di- vided into two parts; but, besides these, Mr Thomas . of London has discovered, that this Animal has four Tendinous Processes, which arise from the inner side of the Sclerotis,'at the bottom of the Eye. These spread out and join anteriorly, to form a kind of Muscular Membrane, that is in.scrted into the Choroides at its widest part, and is supposed to be connected w'ith the internal changes of the Eye. In all Mammalia, the Globe of the Eye is surround- ed with Fat, which answers the same purpose as in the Human Body. OF

40 OF THE-BONES [Part I. Face flat and small, the part analogous to the Nose be- ing upon the summit of the Head. Face.—The size and form of the Face depends, in a great measure, on the figure and extent of the Upper Jaw. Quadrupeds, the Ape tribe not excepted, have two Bones in the Face in addition to those found in Man. These contain the roots of the Dentes Incisores, when such are present, but exist also in Animals destitute of Teeth. They are termed Ossa Interniaxillariay Ossa Jnc'.soria^ vel Labia/ia, and are situated between the Ossa Maxillaria; but the Suture which separates these ■from the Maxillary Bones is obliterated in some Ani- mals at an early period of life. In the Ourang-outang^ as well as in Mammalia in ge- neral, the Jaw’s are longer than in the Human Body. The Elongation is produced by the depth and situation of the superior jVIaxillary Bones, and increases in Qua- drupeds in proportion as they recede from Man. When standing in the ordinary or horizontal posture, the Head of the Quadruped is supported by Muscles, and by the Ligamentum Nuchae, which in general becomes stronger according to the Aveight of the Head. I he prolongation of the Bones of the Face may be determined by the Facial Angle, which becomes more acute according to the length of the Face. 'I he Face of the Ferae, and of several other Quadru- peds, differs from that of the Ape, in having the Nasal Processes'of the superior Maxillary Bones broader, which removes the Orbits to the sides of the FIcad ;—in the Orbitar Surface of these Bones not forming the under, but the anterior parts of the Orbits;—in the Ossa

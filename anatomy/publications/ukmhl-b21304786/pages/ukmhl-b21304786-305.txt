Part IV.] OF FISHES. 299 generally triangular and flat, and lies in a vertical direc- tion, corresponding with the Fin of the Tail. Of the Spinous Processes, one set is placed above, and another below the Bodies of the Vertebras. Be- tween the Bodies of the Vertebras and Roots of the Superior Spinous Processes, is the Canal for the Spinal IMarrow ; while there is frequently a passage between the Bodies and Inferior Spinous Processes for the great Blood-vessels. The Vertebrae are connected to the Head, in Osseous Fishes, by a single Condyle under the Foramen Occi- pitis, while, in the Cartilaginous kind, there are two T ubercles. Fishes have no proper Thorax, -the Abdominal Vis- cera occupying the cavity of the Trunk, which is form- ed by the Spine and the Ribs where they exist, for few of the individuals of the class possess a Sternum. The number and magnitude of the Ribs vary much ' here. In some, the size is considerable; in others, as the Herring, they are like small bristles; in many, they are forked through the greater part of their length ; in some, double throughout. In most Fishes, the Ribs are articulated with the Bodies of the Vertebra.'; in some, they are only fixed to the Transverse Processes. The Anterior ExiremUies of Fishes are their Pectoral Fins, composed, as kins arc in general, of Osseous Rays, and each of these of several articulations, all of Avhich arc joined by a common Membrane. They arc generally fixed to a Bony substance, which is the only thing analogous to the Scapula, and which is articulated with the upper and back part of the Cranium. In the Skate

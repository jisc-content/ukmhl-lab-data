OF THE NOSE [Part I. 108 where the ]\Iaxlllary Bone docs not form a Plate under the Orbit. In the Horse, there are two large Maxilla- ry Sinuses on each side, the one behind the other, each opening by a separate passage into the Nose. These Sinuses are very largo in Pecora ; they are wanting in the Hog, but their place seems to be supplied by a Si- nus in the base of tlie Os Malas. In the Elephant, they are divided, like the Bones of the Cranium, into numerous Cells, which communi- cate with each other, and terminate by a common pas- sage in the Nose. The Foramina in the Cribriform Plate of the Eth- moid Bone, in different Quadrupeds, are so unequal in size, that the part assumes the appearance of Fine Lace, and their number is considered to be in proportion to tlie acuteness of the sense of smelling. They are large and numerous in the Elephant and Hind, but abound most in Animals of the Carnivorous kind. Ossa Spongtosa.â€”The Conchae, or Ossa Spongiosa, are more convoluted in other Mammalia than in Man ; which affording a larger surface for the expansion of the Membrana Pituitaria and the distribution of the Ol- factory Nerves, contributes to increase thepower of smell. Hence most of the Fcrcr, and the Pccara in general, having more complicated Ossa Spongiosa, are observed to possess greater acuteness in this sense. In SoUpeds, Pccora, and Bellnce, the superior or an- terior Spongy Bone is formed in each side by one of the Cells of the Ethmoid Bone, which extends to the Os Spongiosum Inferius, and is placed over it like tiles on a roof. In most of these Animals, its convolutions arc

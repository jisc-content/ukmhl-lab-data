«7S OF ME HEART, &c. [Part III. order. In others, particularly in the Crocodile, it is more complex, being formed into three apartments, Avhich have numerous orifices in their partitions, and these receive the Blood from the Right and Left Au- ricles, as in the Tortoise, where also Valves ire placed to prevent its return. From the different apartments the three great Arteries go out, viz. the Right and Left Aorta, and Pulmonary Artery. In the Serpents, the Heart is more simple than in thr Crocodile ; there are two Aui icles and a Ventricle, with two apartments, and a large communication, or the Heart here resembles, in structure, that of the Tor- toise ; there are, within the \'cntricle, also two Auricular Valves, and many Columnae Carnea?; the former pre- venting the return of the Blood to the Auricle, the latter mixing the Blood from the Lungs, and that from the rest of the Body, intimately together. In the /V'o^and Salamander Jquatica, the Heart has only one Auricle and one Ventricle, with some Col urn- nae Carneac, but these not detached from the sides of the Ventricle. The Ventricle opens into the common 'J'runk of tlic Artery by a single orifice. PRtNciPAL Blood-Vessels.

The ’[ runk of the Aorta commences at the right side of the base of thr

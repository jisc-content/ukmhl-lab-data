In most Quadru- peds it is placed obliquely at the extremity of the Cra- nium, with its posterior edge turned upward. Ani- mals going upon all fours have the Occipital Foramen situated farther back, in proportion as the Face is elongated; to compensate for which, the Head is sus- pended by strong Muscles, and also by the Liga- mentum Nuchae placed upon the upper part of the Neck. Tlie Ape trihe^ but more particularly the Ourang- outang, which fornts a medium between Man, who walks erect, and Quadrupeds that move in the horizontal posture, have this passage nearer the centre of the base of the Cranium than it is in any other Animal, in con- sequence of which, they can support an erect posture longer than other Quadrupeds. The number of Bones here is in general the same as in !Man; but Ossa Triquetra are seldom seen. All the Ape tribe have eight distinct j^ieces. In the Ferev, and many others, the Parietal Bones are united at an early period; but in many Quadrupeds, particularly Horned Cattle^ the Os Frontis is divided by the Sagittal Suture for a considerable time. In some, as the Ferae and Horse, there is only one Parietal Bone; while in others they are joined by accretion to the Os Occipitis. The Bones of the Cranium, in the Elephant, are soon united into one piece, so as to appear like a single Bone. In the Cetacea, the Parietal, Occipital, and Temporal Bones, are early united.

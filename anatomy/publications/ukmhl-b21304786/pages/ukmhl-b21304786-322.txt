OF THE EAR J?l(5 [Pabt IV. Tlie Sac concains a transparent viscid fluid, and has A soft starchy or chalky-like substance placed in its bot- tom, the whole apparatus supplying the place of a VeSr tible and Cochlea. Thei'e is no Tympanum nor Eustachian Tube in this class of Animals. At the anterior part of this Sac, there is a smaller one, compared to the Cochlea of Birds, and behind, there is another still smaller, each communicating with the large Sac, and filled with the same kind of glairy fluid and chalky substance. The ^Membranous semicircular Canals are something similar, in their texture and transparency, to the Capsule of the Crystalline Lens in Mammalia, and are filled with the same kind of glairy liquor as that found ^ in the Sacs, but do not contain any of the Cretaceous matter. One of the Canals pas.ses downwards and outwards, another outwards and backwards, and both approach to a vertical situation. The third is placed between the other two, and runs nearly in a horizontal direction. The anterior and middle Canals join into a common one, which communicates with the' anterior small Sac by a short tube. * The posterior Canal opens into the large Sac by a Duct of considerable size, but has no direct communication with the other two Canals. The Membranous Labyrinth is susjicnded in the Cartilaginous one by Ves.sels and Nerves, and by Cellu- lar substance containing a watery fluid. Upon the Sacs and Ampullae of the Canals, large Nerves arc dispersed, which belong to Trunks analo- gous

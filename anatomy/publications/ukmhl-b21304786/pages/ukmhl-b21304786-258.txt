OF THE FEMALE ORGANS [Part II. 5>52 in a warm atmospliere. The outer Glaire, which is more fluid and transparent than the inner, can be readi- ly separated liom it after being boiled, or otherwise hardeiM?d into a coagulum. The inner Glaire incloses the Yolk^ which is contain- ed in a Menil)rane termed Yolk-bag. The Yolk is pro- portionally heavier than the Glaire, and has attached to the Membrane which covers it, two white Bodies like coagulated Glaire, termed Chalazce or Grandines. The other extremities of these Bodies, considerably expand- ed, penetrate and float in the Albumen. The Chalazae form two ends of an axis, being placed at the oj)posite sides of the Yolk, but at a little distance from its centre, in consequence of which the large por- tion preponderates. On the surface of the Yolk-bag is the Cicatricnla or Macula, termed also the Tread of the Cock, w hich is surrounded by concentric circles, the Halones or Cir- cuVt, the use of w^hich, and of the Chalazas, is not yet fully ascertained. The Cicatricula, being placed upon the smaller portion of the sphere of the Yolk, is found uppermost in whatever position the Egg happens to be placed. Changes produced upon the Egg in time Hatching. â€”This process is effected by the assistance of Atmo- spheric Air, and a certain degree of heat, both of which circumstances are produced by Incubation, or by the Egg being kept for a sufficient length of time, in air heated to an equal degree with that produced by the Animal. But varnishing an Egg all over stops the pro- gress of Incubation, by obstructing the access of the air, though

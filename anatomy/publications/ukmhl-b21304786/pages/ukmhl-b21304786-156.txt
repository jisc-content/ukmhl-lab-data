XoO OF THE STOMACH £Paut I. In Ruminants, these two openings are closer together, leaving a Cul-de-Sac on each side; from which circum- stance the food is longer detained. In the Ape tribe, particularly the Orang-outang, the Stomach varies little in its general appearance from that in Man. There is but one Stomach in Animals destitute of Teeth, as the Ant-eater, and also in the Ornitliorryn- chiis, which has a Horny Papilla near the Pylorus. In many of the Glires, the Stomach is uniform ex- ternally, but divided into pouches internally. In the Rat tribe, the greater number have two pouches, some three, some only one. In the Hare and Rabbit, it is also single, but has tw'o apartments internally, formed by its inner Coats. The left portion is lined with a Cuticle, the right is Villous, and the food is observed to be more digested in the latter. In the Opossum, the Stomach is peculiar in having its two openings close to- gether, resembling those of Birds. The Beaver has a Glandular Body at the Cai dia, resembling the second Stomach of Birds. In the Porcupine there are three Stomachs of unequal size. Of the Ferae, the Kangaroo Rat has the Stomach di- vided into two large Guts; and in the Kangaroo Giant, it forms only one, which is so large as almost to fill the Abdomen, and is formed into Cells by longitudinal Muscular Bands. Uhcre arc two remarkable Appen- dices at the Cardia. In Carnivora, the Stomach is larger in proportion than in ^lan, and is placed more in a longitudinal direc- tion. It is also thicker and stronger, in consequence of ■which

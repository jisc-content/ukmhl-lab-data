[Part 1. OF THE BONES anterior Spinous Processes augmented, in proportion as the Head is heavy or joined to a long neck, for the more advantageous attachment of the Muscles and the Ligamentum Nucha?. We have examples of this in the Elephant, Ox, and Camel, in which they are remark- ably long. The Lumbar Vertebrae vary much in number in the different species of this class, as will be seen in the Table annexed. The Spinous and Transverse Pro- cesses are directed forwards in the sanae angles ; as, for example, in the Dog and Cat. The size of the Trans- verse Processes is considerable in some, as the Ox and Horse, to give attachment to the strong Muscles of the Loins. The Os Sacrum varies more in appearance than either of the former sets of Vertebrae; the number not being the same, even in the different species of the same Ge- nus. It is generally narrower in proportion than in Man, but wider in such Genera as occasionally stand erect, as the Ape, Bear, Sec. The Spinous Processes are longer in most of the Eerce than in Man. In most Ruminants, they almost form a continued crest In the gi eater part of the Ape tribe, it has one or two pieces fewer than in the Human Body. In the long-tailed Ape, indeed, there are six; but in the Ou- rang-outang there are only tliree. In the Horse, it is I'emarkable for the long Lateral Processes at its anterior extremity. The Cetacea want the Pelvi.s, of course the Sacrum. The Os Coccygis is extended to form the Tail, which, in many Quadrupeds, consbts of a great num- ber

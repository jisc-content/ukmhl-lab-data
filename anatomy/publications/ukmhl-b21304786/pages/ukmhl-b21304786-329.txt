32S Part IV.] OF FISHES. X 2 In the Blood, being much larger in their course than at their termination in the Heart. At the opening of some of the Veins in the Heart, or where Branches end in some of the principal Trunks, there is a sort of Valves, which prevent the retrograde motion of the Blood. From the different parts of the Body, the Blood is re- turned to the Heart by one or two Posterior Cavas, si- tuated at the sides of the Aorta, by the Hepatic Vein, and by two Anterior Cavae, one at each side of the Breast. THE ABSORBENT VESSELS, The Mouths of the Absorbents, in Fishes, contrary to what is found in other Animals, can in some measure be seen, especially in some of the Raja, as the Skate. If a coloured fine injection be thrown into one of the principal Trunks, it passes out by numerous streams, especially on the back of the Animal. The Absorbents, in this class of Animals, are some- what flat, and have the appearance of having Joints or Valves; but no real Valves are found in any part of them, excepting at their termination in the red Veins, for an injection can be made readily to pass from the Trunks to the extreme Branches. They are also quite destitute of Conglobate Glands, and the Lacteals contain transparent Chyle.

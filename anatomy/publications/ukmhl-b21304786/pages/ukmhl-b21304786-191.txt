In the Bear, Dog, &c. it forms a large part of the Penis. In most of the Glires, and in the Cat, it is proportionally small. The Urethra, as in Man, is continued from the inner lining of the Bladder. In the Horse, it has been ob- served to have, externally, transverse jMuscular Fibres from one extremity to the other. It is divided into a Posterior and an Anterior Portion ; the former, at the sides of the Verumontanum, receives the Semen and liquor of the Prostate Gland. The posterior portion of the Urethra varies in length in different Genera. In some Apes, it is short, as in Man. In some other Animals, as the Civet Cat, Kan- garoo Rat, it is about half the length of the Canal. This portion is termed by some Masculcvr, as being Inclosed in a laver of Muscular Fibres, running more or less in a transverse direction ; and in some, as SoUpeds and Ruminants, it is of considerable thickness and strength, thereby assisting in the expulsion of the Se- men. The other portion of the Urethra begins by a Bulb, and is commonly placed under the Corpora Cavernosa, and inclosed by walls of the same nature with those of these Spongy Bodies. It begins behind by two Crura, each inclosed in a separate Muscle. The Bulb of the Urethra is thin in Carnivora, but of considerable strength in SoUpeds, Ruminants, and Bclluce.

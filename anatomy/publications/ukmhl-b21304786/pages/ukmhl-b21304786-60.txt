[Part I. OF THE BOXES >>4 tween wlildi the ^lenibranes of the "Wings are extend- <â€˜(1, are much elongated, espeeially the last, which have no Nails; but the Thinnb is short, and furnished with a Claw, in form of a hook, by which the Animal can suspend itself when in a state of rest. 'I'he GUres have the Thumb short, but otherwise perfect. In the Fcrcr, the Toe, re.sembling the Human I humb, is on the same ])lane with the other Toes ; of course they have not the power of grasping any thing. In some, as the Bear, Badger, &c. it is almost equal in length. In the Dog', Cat, &c. it is shorter. Each of the Bones of the last Phalanx in the Lion, Tiger, Cat, &c. is remarkable in having the fore part in form of a hook, which receives the -Claw' as in a / .sheath. The back part forms two Processes, to which the Muscles arc attached, that can at once extend the Claw and bend the Phalanx. In Ruminants, the single Metacarpal Bone supports the two Toes which form the part termed Cloven Foot. Several species have besides two little Bones, frequently covered with Nails, Avhich represent two other Toes ; but these are so short as not to touch the irround. There is here also a small Bone, which forms a Rudi- ' ment of the 'I humb. In Solvpcds, the only vestige of the lateral Toes, are the two sharp-pointed Styloid Bones, on each side of the Canon Bone. 'I'he three Bones of the single Poe are tm med Pastern, Coronet, and Coffin Bones; the last of which is received into the Hoof. At the back parjt of the Pastern arc also two Sesamoid Bones.

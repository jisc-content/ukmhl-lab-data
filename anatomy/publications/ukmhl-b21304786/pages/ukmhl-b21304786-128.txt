j;.”2 OF THE MOUTH, &c. [Paet I. Tusks, serving chiefly for offensive or defensive wea- pons. In the Seal and the Cetacea^ all the Teeth are of the same form, and answer merely the purpose of seizing the Food. The Tusks, or Defences, of the Elephant, Wal- rus, and Narwal', are incrusted over with a substance liarder than the body of the Tusk, but softer than Enamel. The Osseous substance composing these Tusks, which, in the class Belluce in general, and some of the Whale tribe, forms the Ivory, differs from that of other Teeth, in being of a harder and denser texture. The Ivory of ,tlie Elephant’s Tusk is distin- guished from that of all others by tlie Curvilinear Lo- zenges which appear very distinctly in the polished trans- verse section of a Tusk, Tire Ivory .of this Animal is softer than that of others, and acquires a yellow hue by exposure to the air. That of the Hippopotamus is harder and whiter than the former, and preferred by Dentists in the making of artificial Teeth. The most remarkable Teeth are those of the Cajjc Ant-eaicr, which are formed of cylinders composed of small Tubes, shut at the triturating surfaces, and, when cut transversely, appearing like a section of a Cane. The I'eeth of the Ornithorrpnehus are observed to have a similar structure. The Bodies of Teeth, in some Animals, have a par- ticular colour, as in the ASg’wirrf/, Beaver, &c. where they are brown anteriorly; and in several Pecora, where the Molares are covered by a hard black substance of a glass}" appearance. In the Ox and Sheep, it is of a kronze colour. The

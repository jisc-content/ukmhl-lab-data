Paet VII.] OP INSECTS. 367 In merous in the Larvae of Insects, than in the perfect state. In Larvae, a Trachea runs on each side of the Body, under the Skin, and generally opens externally by nine or ten apertures, termed Strgmata. From these the same number of Air-vessels, or Branchiae, of a silver colour, pass off, to be dispersed through the Body by innumerable Branches, but particularly on the Alimen- tary Canal, and on the part compared to the Omentum. The above is the most common distribution of the Tra- cheae ; but in several Aquatic Larvae, and even perfect Insects, the Air enters by two openings near the Anus, at the end of the Abdomen. Hymenoptera and Dvptcra have two principal Tracheae, with some small ones, at the base of the Abdomen. The Aranece have no 'Fra- cheae ; their organs of Respiration are confined to a few Vesicles, but which have an aperture at each side of the base of the Abdomen. The Tracheae of Insects are described by Authors as being composed of an outer, inner, and middle Mem- brane, the last of which is formed of Spiral Fibres. Insects are incapable of forming any Voice ; the noise which many of them make is formed chiefly by their Wings. Alimentary Canal.â€”The Esophagus is a straight short T ube, reaching from under the Brain to the first Gan- glion of the Nerves. The rest of the Canal difl'ers much in appearance in different kinds of Insects, and in different stages of the same Individual. In the Lar- vae state, it is of great size, particularly the Stomach, when compared with that of the perfect Insect.

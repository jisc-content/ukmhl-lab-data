[Pabt II. 5::iS OF THE EYE and are placed so mucli in a lateral direction, that the Animal, in viewing objects particularly, turns towards them one side of the Head, and examines them with a sinffle Eve. The Orhite are more shallow here than in Quadru- peds, of course, the cushion of Fat surrounding the back part of the Eye is thinner. In most Birds, as Fowl, Duel:, Turkey, &c. the Eye- lids are closed by the Orbicularis elevating the Inferior Palpebra, which is the largest, and has a small Lamina of Cartilage. '1 here is a peculiar Muscle arising from the bottom of the Orbit, for depressing this Eye-lid. In a few, as the Parrot, Owl, Goat-sticker, Ostrich, &c. the Upper Eye-lids are most moveable. Cilia are found in a few Birds only, as some Parrots and Hawks, the Ostrich, &c. Besides the tw’o ordinary or liorizontal Eye-lids, Birds have a third one placed at the Nasal Angle, and termed Mevihrana Nictitans, which is a semi-tran.sjja- rent Membrane, capable of covering the whole E}’e. In a state of rest, it is scarcely observed, but can be di*awn out by the action of two IMuscles, so as (o cover the whole front of the Globe. The Muscles jx?rforming this motion, arise from the back of the Sclerotic. The one, termed Quadratns, has its origin from above ; the otlier, called Pyratnidalis, comes from below, and forms a Tendinous Cord, that runs through an Aponeurotic Sheath formed by the first, then in Cellular Substance, at the under part of the Sclerotica, to be fixed to the ipferior and exteiior edge of the Membrana Nictitans.

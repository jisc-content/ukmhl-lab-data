117 Fart I.] OF Mx\MMALIA. In the Ape kind, the Parotid Gland is remarkably large, and here the Maxillary and Sublingual open each by a distinct Duct at the Frasnuin Linguae. The Parotid exists in all Quadrupeds, except in some of the Ant-eaters, and the Seal. In the former Ani- mals, the want is supplied by the Maxillary, which ap- pears to be increased in size. In the Seal, the Sublin- gual is wanting, as well as the Parotid. In the Glires, the Salivary Glands are of consider- able size. The Parotid, in the Rabbit, embraces the Concha of the Ear, and extends as far as the Maxillary Gland. The Parotid Duct, in the GUres, crosses the upper part of the Masseter, and perforates the Mouth opposite the last superior Molaris. The Duct of the Maxillary has no Papilla at its termination upon the side of the Fraenum Linguae. In some of the Porcupine Ant-eaters, the Parotid is smaller than the Maxillary ; the latter is extended in the Neck. The Sublingual is long and narrow, and the Molar Glands are united into a mass under the Buccinator. The Salivary Glands, in the Carnivora, are smaller than in the Glires, little mastication being required by this set of Animals. The Parotid is commonly not larger than the Maxillary, and is often of an inferior size, as in the Dog. In this Animal, and in the Cat, the Parotid is of a crescentic form, and embraces the Concha of the Ear, extending as far as the Maxillary Gland. In the Cat, the Sublingual Gland is wanting, H 3 and

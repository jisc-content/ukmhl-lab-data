Paut VII.] OF INSECTS. 3t)l culai* Bands situated within the Body. Sometimes they are covered by Bristles or Hooks, which enable them to lay hold more firmly of other substances. Many have Hairs or Spines upon the surface of their Body, which are cast off with the Skin at certain periods, and are afterwards re-produced. The Bodies of many Lnrvcc have, at their under, and near their fore part, six Feet, each terminating in a hook, by which they can fix themselves, and draw the posterior to the anterior part of dieir Body. Some have, besides, a number of small Claws, to assist them in their motions. Others crawl by the assistance of hooked Mandibles, and by Tubercles on different parts of their Body. The Bodies of Insects are divided into Head, Cors- let, Pectus, Abdomen, and Members. The Head is joined to the Body, in some, by ball and socket; in others, by plain surfaces ; in others, after the manner of a hinge. In some, the connection is entirely Liga- mentous, the different motions corresponding with the nature of the Joint. The Corslet or Thorax is situated between the Pectus and Head. The first pair of Feet are joined to this, and it contains the Muscles for mov- ing these and the Head. The Wings, when present, are fixed to the upper part of the Pectus, and the four posterior Feet to its under part. To the upper part a Horny Process is frequently fixed, termed Scutdlum, or Escuchcon. The Pectus contains the Muscles which move the Wings and four pair of Feet. Abdomen.â€”It commonly consists of different Rings. In

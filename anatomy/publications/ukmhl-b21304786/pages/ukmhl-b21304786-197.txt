In the Ape tribe, it is larger than in Women, and is also of considerable size in most of the Glircs, and in the Carnivora. The Pre- puce covering it forms, in some, as the Bear, a Pouch ; in others, as the Bitch, a Cul-de-Sac.

In the Lemur Tardigradus, belonging to the order Quadruma-^ Tia, the Urethra runs through the Clitoris, and termi- nates upon its extremity. Gravid Uterus. The changes which the Uterus undergoes by Impreg- nation, vary according to the nature of the Animal to which it belongs. The Os Tinccc, in all the different Mammalia, is closed soon after Impregnation, by a Gluti- nous Mucilaginous Matter, secreted by Glands or Fol- licles, which cuts off all communication between the inten'ial

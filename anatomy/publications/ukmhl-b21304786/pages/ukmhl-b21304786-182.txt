OF THE BLADDER m [Part I. in the Pccora, the Bladder is much larger, and more dilatable, but less thick and strong, than in the Carni- vora ; hence the latter are observed to evacuate the Urine more frequently. The structure of the Bladder varies in these two kinds of Animals. In Carnivora^ it is commonly com- posed of strong Fasciculi of transverse and lon- gitudinal Muscular Fibres. Some Herbivorous Ani- mals, as the Horse^ have also a thick Muscular Blad- der ; while other Herhivora, and some Omnivorous A- nimals, as the Ape tribe and Hog\ have the Bladder proportionally not thicker than in I\Ian.

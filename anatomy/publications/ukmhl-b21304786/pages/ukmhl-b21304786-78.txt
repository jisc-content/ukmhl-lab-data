[Part I. 72 OF THE MUSCLES erect attitiule. The other Muscles are nearly as in Man. Muscles of the Foot.—The Gastrocnemius is always present, but the Solcus is smaller than in Man, and is remarkably slender in Solipeds and Ruminants. In Moidceps, the Plantaris is continued over the Os Calcis, to the Aponeurosis Plantaris. The Tibialis Anticus, in Animals which have no Great Toe, as the Dog and Rabbit, is inserted into the first of their Toes. In So- Jipeds and Ruminants, it is inserted into the Base of the Canon Bone.

The Horse has but one Peroneus. In Ruminants, the Pe- roneus Brevis is wanting. Muscles of the Toes.—Monlicys have two Extensors of the small Toes ; but, besides an Extensor PoUicls, there is an Abductor Longus Pollicis, which is peculiar to this tribe of Animals. Other digitated Animals have the same number as in the Human Body. The Extensor Pollicis is w'anting in Animals destitute of a Greai. Toe, as the Do^o-and Rabbit. In the Solipeds and Ruminants, the Meshy Fibres arise from the Canon Bone, and are inserted into the Tendon of the Exten- sor

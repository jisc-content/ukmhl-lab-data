OF FISHES. Part IV.] 317 gous to the Fifth, and Portio Mollis of the Seventh Pair, but‘chiefly to the latter. When the Animal is laid in the supine situation, and the Cartilage, which, in the natural state, lies under the Ear, is properly separated. Branches of the Portio Mollis are observed to form Penicilli upon the Ampullse, and an intricate Plexus on the Vestible, and small Sacs projecting from it, which are fully exhibited in Dr Monho’s Work on the Eye and Ear. In Osseous Fishes^ the Organ of Hearing has a gene- ral similarity with that of the former kind, but differs in several particulars. No Meatus Externus has been found. The Internal Ear is inclosed in the same common Cavity with the Brain; the Bones at the sides of the Brain oiily form- ing some Processes, to which the Labyrinth is connect- ed by Cellular Substance and Vessels, and by some Os- seous and Cartilaginous bridles. In some parts, also. Membranes intervene, but there is no distinct partition. There is a Sac or Vestible of considerable size, simple in some, divided in others, containing a viscid fluid, and one, two, or three Cretaceous stones, the number varying according to the kind of Animal. The stones have a particular figure, are of various sizes, and are white and hard like Porcelain. They are suspended in the Pulpy fluid by a beautiful Plexus of Nerves, and have been regarded by some as serving the same purpose with the Ossicula Auditus in Mam- malia. There are here, also, semicircvdar or Circular Canals, the outer Osseous, the inner Membranous; and, as in Cartilaginous

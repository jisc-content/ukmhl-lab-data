[Part VI. .■35G OF CRUSTACEA. Brain is divided above into four Lobes, from which a j)air of Optic Nerves are sent off. Four Nerves pass to the four Antennae and adjacent parts. From the pos- terior part of the Brain Nerves go off, which form a Collar round the Esopliagus. The different Nerves form Ganglia, which supply more particularly the seve- ral Muscles. In the Lobster kind in general, the Kye is placed oft a moveable Tubercle, and is somewhat conical. When magnified, it presents different Facets, which are hard and tran.sparent, representing so many Corneas. Lin- ing these, there is an opiupic Pigment, which appears to leave no aperture for the passage of the light. At a little distance from the Cornere, is a dark-coloured ^lembrane, cfmsidered as the Choroides, which has a production of the Optic Nerve on its posterior, as well as its anterior surface, and therefore forming a sort of double Retina. But how the light can act upon the bottom of the Eye through the opacpie lining of tlie Cornea,—and whether these Animals, from the com-' pound nature of their Eyes, see objects multiplied or single,—are circumstances not understood. The Ear, in the Lobste?', is a small Sac inclosed in a scaly cylinder. At the base of the Antennje, the Nerves pass through this cylinder into the Sac, the opposite ex- tremity of which is inclosed by an elastic Membrane analogous to the Membrana Tympani, or the Fenestra Ovalis, and is observed at the bottom of the large An - tenna'.

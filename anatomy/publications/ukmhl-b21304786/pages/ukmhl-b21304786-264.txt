OF THE TONES [Pakt III. and Scapula, the Os Humeri is fixed as in Biixls. T. his and the other four-footed Reptiles have two Rones in the Fore-Ann^ though the division into two is not very distinct. In the Tortoise, the Feet are proportionally small, in consequence of which the Animal is observed to be slow in its motions. 'I’here are three Ranges of Rones in the Carpus, the pieces varying in number in the dilferent ranges. The Phalanges of the Fingers or Toes are nearly as in Mam- malia ; but in the Sea Tortoise, the different pieces are flat, being formed into a kind of Fins. 'I'he Frog and Toad have no motion in the Upper ■Jaw, and they are destitute of real Teeth, though they have pointed Bodies serving as a substitute, and placed in the Palate ; the Frog has them also in the Upper Jaw. The Head is joined by two Condyles to the Spine, which is short, and terminates^behind by a single Rone, articulated with the Os Innominatum. The Dorsal Vcrtchroe have broad Transverse Pro- cesses, that may somewhat supply the place of Ribs, which are wanting here. The Os Sacrum consists of one long Rone. There is no Os Coccygis in these animals. The Scaj)ula is joined to the Sternum by double Cla- vicles, or there is a Clavicle and Fork-like Rone in each \ side. 'I he Fore-Arm and Leg consist of a single Bone, tlivided at its extremities into two portions. The Car- pus is formed of three ranges. The jpreg^has one Rone to the First Digit, tw’o to the second and third Digits, and three to the fourth and fifth. In the Lhard tribe, the Cranium, or at least the ca- \lty for the Brain, is uncommonly small. In a Ci'occ- dUe

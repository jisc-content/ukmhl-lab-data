[Part I. OF THE MUSCLES 69. radiated and oblique Fibres approximate the Skin and tile Tubes without contracting the cavity of the latter. 'I'he odiei-s, which go across the Proboscis, contract both the surface of the Organ and the Canals it contains. 'J'hev can at the same time elongate the whole of the >' Organ, or a particular part only. T he longitudihai Fasciculi form four large IMuscles, which occupy all the outer part of the Organ.' 'i'hcy are divided by Tendi- nous Intersections, and take their origin behind from the Bones of the Face. I hey serve to shorten the Avhole or a part of it, and give that extraordinary power which the Animal possesses of moving the Snout in every direction. The IMuscles of the Mouth of Quadrupeds must vary according to the shape of the Lips. In the Llcg*, the Mouth is moved by six pairs of Muscles and a Sphinc?- tcr, viz. the I..evator and Depressor Labii Superioris Almque Na'si,- the former of which is principally used in snarling; the Levator and Depressor Labii Inferio- ris, the Buccinator, and Masseter. The five first are nearly as in Man; the last has many of its Fibres spread out upon the Buccinator, in consequence of which they can forcibly raise the corners of the Mouth. The Mouth of the Horse is moved by the following Muscles, viz. tlie Levator Labii Superioris, which in this Animal is used in neighing, and in the Ass for braying; a Muscle termed Pyramidalis, analogous to the Levator Labii Superioris and Levator .4nguli Oris,' arising from the fore part of the Superior Maxillary Bone at the Zygoma, and fixed to the Ala Nasi andâ€™ Corner of the Mouth; another Levator, termed Max- illartd,''

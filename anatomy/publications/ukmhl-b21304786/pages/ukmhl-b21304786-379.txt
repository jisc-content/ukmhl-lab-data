OF WORMS. SIS Pajit VIII.] • A a 3 the above, and two below their Body, which they move ac- cording to the direction or skuatlou of the Fibres. These form the principid part of the Body of the Ani- mal. Another set of MuscJcs are appropriated to the Hairs, Bristles, Sic. and consist of short Fibres, some of which are for pusliing them outwards, others for drawing them inwards. By these Muscles, and tlie Spines, Sic. on which they act, the Animal is enabled to perform its locomotion. One set of Worms want these Spines or Bristles, of course move in a different manner fmm the former. Tlieir progression is accomplished by applying the two extremities of their Body alternately to the surface of the parts on which they move. These consist of Leeches^ which have the extremities of their Bodies formed into contractile fleshy Disks or Suckers; or some have Anterior Extremities provided with Hooks ; tlie outer parts of their Body being a fleshy Sac, com- posed of longitudinal and circular Fibres. By fixing one end, and contracting the circular Fibres, the Body can be so elongated, as to allow the other extremity to reach the place intended. The Animal now fixes this extremity, and, by contracting the longitudinal Fibres, draws the other end forwards. Nervous System.—No Nerves have been discovered in several of the internal Worms, but in the external Worms the Nervous System has been considered as ana- logous to that of Crustacea and Insects. A Cord generally runs through the whole length of the Animal, and has Ganglia regularly dispersed, from which numerousNerves proceed to the different parts of the Body. In the Aphro- dita Aculeatdf the Nervous System is similar to that of

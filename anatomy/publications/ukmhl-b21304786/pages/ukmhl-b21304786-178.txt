[Pakt I. 172 OF THE OMENTUM but in tlic rest of the Ape tribe, it is similar to what is found in other Brutes. In Caryiivora and Ruminants, its extent Is very great. In a few Animals, on the con- trary, as the Bruxen Bear, it does not reach the middle of the Abdomen. The Omentum, in this class of Animals, frequently contains much Fat, and the spaces between the diffe- rent Strias of Fat are composed of the same kind of fine IMembrane as in the Human Body; but the quan- tity of Fat depends greatly on age and manner of living. In Herbivorous .â€œAnimals, it is generally furnished with more than in the Carnivorous ; but in both, the quan- tity depends much upon rest. It is also affected by the season, moderate lieat increasing the quantity ; though, on the contrary, in Animals that remain benumbed in winter, the Omentum is charged with this substance. Many of these, as the Dormouse, the Marmot of the Alps, &c. have, in addition to the Omentum, two fatty Appendices, which cover the Intestines in the lateral parts of the Abdomen ; they have likewise a large quan- tity of Subcutaneous Fat, which may also serve as a re- servoir of nourishment; but the fatty appendages are absent in some of the Dormice, the Bear, &c. though these Animals are of the same nature with those that have them.

Part IV.] OF FISHES. 81S than in Land Animals, the more completely to refract the rays of light coming from the water. It is remark- ably large in most Fishes, but the Vitreous Humour is proportionally small. The Optic Nerves, in Osseous Fishes, cross each other without any intermixture of Medullary Sub- stance, and go to the opposite Eyes. The crossing is less apparent in the Cartilaginous kind. In the Skate, the Right Nerve passes through an opening in the Left. In general, the Body of the Nerve is Fibrous, as in other Animals; but in some, as the Steord-fish, it is formed of Layers put together like a Fan, and inclosed in the Dura Mater. In many Fishes, as the Raja and Squalus, the Nerve, getting into the Eye, forms, as in Reptiles, a small Tu- bercle, from the edges of which the Retina grows; but in others, as the Salmon, Herring, &c. the Nerve, as in Birds, after perforating the Choroid Coat, forms two white lines, which give origin to the Retina. The Retina has a peculiar appearance in Fishes, be- ing formed of two Layers, the external of which is Me- dullary, and the internal Fibrous. The Muscles, in this class of Animals, as in the for- mer, are six in number, four straight, and two oblique; but both of the latter come from tb.e anteriorâ€™and under side of the Orbit. One is inserted at the under, the other at the upper part of the Eye, without the inter- vention of a Pulley, as in jMammalia. OF

Part I.] OF MAMMALIA. 107 opening, to the Posterior Maxillai-y Sinuses. Among the Pccora, there are scarcely any Frontal Sinuses in the Deer, while the Ox and Sheep have them of great extent. In the Pig, also, they are very extensive ; but the Elephant has them the largest that arc found in any iVnimal, if the Diploe, or Cells, already mention- ed, can be regarded as such. They extend, in that Animal, between the Tables of the Frontal, Parietal, and Temporal Bones, as far as the Occipital Condyles. I'he Rhinoceros and Hippopotamus have none. Ethmoid Cells.—In a number of Quadrupeds, these are distinct from the Superior Spongy Bones, and they are sometimes separated from the general Cavity of the Nose by a distinct partition. In the greater number of Anin)als, they vary considerably in tlielr appearance from those in Man. They are sent down from the Cri- briform Plate in the form of hollow Pedicles, and, ex- tending in the Cavity of the Nose, the nearest, in pro- portion as they advance, unite with each other. They form little Caverns, which, as they increase in size, be- come less numerous, and communicate among them- selves by different passages. Carnivorous Quadrupeds are found to have the greatest proportion of these Cells. The Glires have but few. Sphenoidal Sinuses.—These are the smallest in pro- portion in Quadrupeds ; many want them, but they are of great extent in the Elephant, though not Cellular, like the other Sinuses of this Animal, Maxillary Sinuses.— In the Ape tribe, these are pro- portionally smaller than in Man. They are diminutive in most of the Glires and Carnivora, and, in general, where

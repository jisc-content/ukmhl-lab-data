In many Animals, each Vas Deferens unites with the Vesicula of its side; in others, the Vasa De- ferentia and Ducts from the Vesiculae terminate by a common opening in the Verumontanum. In the Ape tribe, the appearance of tlie Vesiculae Se- minales is nearly the same as in the Human Body. In most of the Glires they are remarkable for their great size. The V^esiculae of the Squirrel are particu- lar, in being placed upon the inner side of the Vasa Deferentia. In the Rat^ they are so large as t6 be partly without the Pelvis. The Guinea Pig has them of a long cylindrical form, and containing a cheesy-like substance. In the Hare, their place is sup- plied by a rectaligular Sac, which has in one part a Glandular appearance, and opens into the Verumonta- num along with the Vas Deferens. In the Hedge-hog, they exceed the size of the Testes, forming on each side four or five Fasciculi, each of which is composed' of a Tube wonderfully convoluted. The different' Tubes join into one Canal, that opens into the Veru- montanum along with the Vas Deferens. In the Horae, Boar, Elephxmt, and Rhinoceros, the Vesiculae are of great size, and form on each side a common Duct with the Vas Deferens. Vesiculae Accessoricc.â€”These are Membranous Tubes, varying in number, and situatc*d at the inner side of the \ esiculaj Seminales, or at the origin of the Ure- thra. They terminate by one or more Excretory Ducts, in common with the Vesiculae Seminales and Vasa De- ferentia,

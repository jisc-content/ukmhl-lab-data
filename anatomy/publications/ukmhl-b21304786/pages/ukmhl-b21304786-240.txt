ORGANS OF VOICE, &c. [Part II. 231 The Vocal Orcan is furnished with Muscles from the O surrounding parts, and these vary in number in diffe- rent Species. The strength of the Muscles of the Inferior Larynx, was found, by Mu Hunter, to be in projwrtion to that of the Voice. Tliey appeared stronger in the Common Cock, but weaker in the Capon ; and here the Animal lias not the power of crowing. The Muscles of the Larynx of the Nightingale were found stronger than in any other Animal of the same size. At the Inferior Larynx the Voice of the Animal is chiefly formed, as may be'observed by cutting the Tra- chea across below the Superior Larynx, in a living Bird ; or in a dead one, after performing the same ope- ration, blowing in air till it distends the Body, then suddenly forcing it out again ; or by cutting out the tinder end, with part of the Bronchi, and blowing air from the Iâ€™ulmonary Extremity. 'J he Inferior Glottis is compared to the reed at the movith of the wind instruments, as the Clarionet, &c. the Superior Glottis to the holes, and the Trachea to the Body of the instrument. '1 he 7?ronc7if are formed of two Tubes, which, like the Trachea, are commonly cylindrical,, but sometimes have dilatations and contractions, and are composed of Cartilaginous or Osseous Arches, the curves varying occasionally by the action of the IMuscles. 'i he Bronchi proceed in angles more or less acute, but are never subdivided, till they enter the Lutigs, after which they lay aside their Cartilaginous struc- ture, and become entirely Membranous; but the Sxoan

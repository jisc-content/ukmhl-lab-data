OF INSECTS. 369 Pa»t VIL] fine Vessels, or Intestinula Caeca, attached to the Ali- mentary Canal, which produce a liquor, generally yel- low, though sometimes white, which is considered as the Eile. The Ducts terminate commonly near the Stomach, but now and then in a more distant part of the Intestines. The Spleen is wanting here, but in Larvae, and in some perfect Insects, particularly in those that spend a considerable part of their time in a torpid state, a large Adipose substance occupies a considerable portion of the Body, and exists in great abundance in the Larvae of Insects. It has been considered by some as an O- mentum, though a real Omentum, such as is found in many Animals, does not exist in this class. Insects have neither Kidneys, Bladder of Urine, nor Pancreas, their different secretions being performed by loose Vessels, which float in the Abdomen. By means of these, various fluids are secreted, some of which have a foetid, and others a pleasant smell. The Bee, Wasp, &c. have two Vesicles situated at the bottom of their Sting, which throw out a very acrid fluid, that the Ani- mal can discharge at pleasure through a perforation in the Sting^ In the Bee, the Sting is barbed at the point, and commonly remains in the wound it inflicts. The Scorpion throws a fluid of a dangerous nature, also, through its sting. Some of the Spiders discharge a fluid, which renders their bite dangerous. Organs of 'Generation.—The greater number of In- sects have the external parts of Generation situated at the posterior part of the Abdomen. In Spiders, with a few exceptions, thev are placed in the Palpi Maxllla- VoL. IV. A a res.

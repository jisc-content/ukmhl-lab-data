The Lateral Muscles in particular, acting together, expand the feathers in the Tail, so as to pro- duce that beautil’ul fan-like appearajice, so remarkable in the Turkey, Peacock, and Pheasant. Of the Muscles of the Ribs, the Scalenus is analo- gous to the Levatores Costarum, ivhich extend from the transverse processes of the Vertebra?, to the anterior edges of the Ribs.

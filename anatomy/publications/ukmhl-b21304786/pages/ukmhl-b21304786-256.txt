250 OF THE FEMALE ORGANS [Part II. I closed bv' a Process oi the Peritoneum, wliich attaclics k to tlie Spine. It consists ofâ€™a cluster of Ova, resem- blinfT a buncli of grapes, but varying in size, from tlie full-<mnvn yoke to that of a grain of mustard-seed. The-largest are yellow, the smallest white; and in a Hai beginning for the. first time to lay, the number is about 500. The Ovaria have Rlood-vessels similar to tlioscof Mammalia, which also a.sslst in fixing them in their place. The largest of the Yolks are always found at the outer .-ide. F.ach is inclosed in a Caltjx^ or Membrane, and f,u)>})orted on a Pedicle^ or Foot-stalk, which is fixed to the Ovarium. AYhen the Yolk is ripe, it bursts the Membrane, and is then received by the Infundibulum, which conveys it to the Oviduct. The Infundibulum has a plaited or folded margin, like the Fimbriae of the F.\li,orian Tube, and is connected behind by a round Ligament. The Oviduct is at first straight, but afterwards so convolut- ed, as frequently to exceed the length of the Bird, and gradually increases in thickness and strength, till it , reaches the Cloaca. Externally, it is covered by the .Peritoneum, within which arc some Muscular Fibres. The inner side is formed by a Membrane covered with Follicles, Avhich secrete the white of the Egg. It has a numlier of broad longitudinal folds, and is connected to the Spine by a kind of ^Mesentery. d'he Oviduct terminates, and deposites the Egg, in the Llcrus, which is full of wrinkles internally, and may be considered as merely a dilated part of the Ovi- duct.

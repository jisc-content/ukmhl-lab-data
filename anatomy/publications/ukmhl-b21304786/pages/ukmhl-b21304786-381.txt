Part VIII.] OF WORMS. 375 I'he Earth-worm also has longitudinal Vessels filled with red blood, in which, as in all other Wornis with red blood, there is a distinct pulsation. Their Vascu- lar Skin supplies the place of Branchiaj; but in the other Genera there is a subdivision of the Blood-vessels in the form of a Tuft, which may answer a similar pui- pose. In some, as the Aphrodite, there are little Crests, like those of a Cock, placed above each Tubercle, car- rying Spines. In all these Animals, the Branchiae are provided with Arteries and Veins, as in the higher classes, and here Respiration is considered to be per- formed by the Vascular System. In Hydatids there is nothing like a Vascular System. Intestinal Canal.—I’he Lumbriens Terrestris has but one long Canal, destitute of a Mesentery, divided by several Partitions; the anterior dilatations forming a sort of Stomach. In the Leech, this Canal runs from one end of the Body to another, and is divided into many Cells. In some Worms, as the Taenia and Fasciola Hepa- tica, the Esophagus serves as an Aorta, conveying nou- rishment to the other parts of the Body. In the Tcenia Solium, or common Tape-worm, which is composed of a chain of Quadrangular Joints, there is an Orifice, in one of the margins of each articulation. This has been considered by most Authors as a Mouth, and by a few, as Bloch, &c. is regarded as a Vagina. It is sometimes in the one Margin, or sometimes in the other, without observing any particular order. From this Orifice a Canal goes off’, which runs along the mar- gin of each Joint, and communicates with its fellow at the extremity of eadi articulation. A Canal is also seen A a 4 in I

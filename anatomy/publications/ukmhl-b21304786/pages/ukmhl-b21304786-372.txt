^66 OF INSECTS. [Part VII Organ of Taste and Salivation.—The seat of the Organ of Taste in Insects is variable. The Under Lip by some, the posterior pair of Palpi by others, but commonly the long Tube in the Buttcrf y, has been con- sidered as the Tongue. Many of the Butterjlies^ Bees, Ants, Common Flies, and Spiders, have a Spiral or Tu- bular 'I'ongue, or a soft Proboscis, in a horny pointed Tube, by which they suck in their nourishment. No Salivary Glands are observed in the Mouths of Insects, though a fluid similar to Saliva, but varying in colour in different Insects, is observed to come from the INIouths of some of these Animals. Circulating System.—No real Circulating System has been found in proper Insects, yet many of these Animals, both in the Larvae and perfect state, have a Membra- nous Canal along the Back, in which alternate contrac- tions and dilatations are discerned. In the Caterpillar, the pulsation begins at the posterior extremity of the Animal, and proceeds from one segment of the Body to another, till it arrives at -the Head. This Vessel is therefore considered by some Authors as the Heart, but it is closed at the extremities, and Vessels are seen going from or to it. Nutrition and Secretion, therefore, are supposed to be effected in a different manner from what takes place in more perfect Animals. Cuvier considers Imbibition to be the mode by which these are performed. Respiratory Organs.—Respiration is performed by Tracheae ramified over most of the Body, but chiefly on the Intestines; there are, however, no Cellular l^ungs. The Tracheae arc much larger and more nu- meroLiti

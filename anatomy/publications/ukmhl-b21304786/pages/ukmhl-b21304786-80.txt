T4- OF THE INTEGUMENTS [Part I. OF THE COMMON INTEGUMENTS. 1 HE Integuments in Mammalia consist of the same number of Layers as in Man ; but these vary not only in different Species, but in different parts of the same individual. The Cuticle is more or less dry, according to the ele- ment in which the Animal lives, being like horn in those that live in the Air, and more of a Mucilaginous nature in such as inhabit the Water. In general it is uniform in its texture, but is often marked with lines corresponding with inequalities of the Cutis Vera. In particular parts of some Animals, as in Apes and Ba- boons, in the parts on which they sit, it is remarkably thick, while in the points of their Fingers it is thin and delicate. In some, as the Elephant, it forms a horny covering. In some, it is detached from the Skin in the foi'm of scales; in others, it comes off at the same sea- son with the Hairs. In the Cetacea, it is remarkably smooth, being always covered w'ith an oily matter, which defends it from the water in which it is constantly immersed. The Corpus Mucosum varies in thickness in different Animals,

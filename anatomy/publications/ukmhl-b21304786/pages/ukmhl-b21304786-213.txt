Part IL] W7 OF BIRDS, Furciforme, the Keel of the Sternum, and the last Ribs', and is inserted into a prominent Linea Aspera of the Os Humeri. By depressing this Bone, the Muscle produces the quick and poweidul motions of the Wing in flying. The Second, or Middle Pectoral, is situated under the former, and sends a 'I'endon over the union of the Scapula, Furcula, and Clavicle, as over a pulley, to ele- vate the Humerus, and balance the Animal in its flight. The I bird, or Smallest Pectoral, arises from the late- ral angle of the Sternum and base of the Clavicle, and brings the Humerus close to the Body, in which mo- tion it is assisted by two small Muscles, passing between the Clavicle and Head of the Humerus. By the action of these three Muscles, the alternate motions of rais- ing and depressing the Wing are produced, by which the Bird is carried forward in flying. By the strength of the Tail the Animal is kept in a proper balance, and prevented from falling forward. The Latissimus Dorsi is formed of two portions, oneâ€™ fixed under the Head, and the other at the middle of the Body of the Humerus. '1 he other Muscles of the Scapula are nearly as in the Human Body. The Biceps has one origin from the Scapula, and another from the Os Humeri, and is inserted into the Ulna. The Bracheus arises from the Linea Aspera, and is fixed to the inner side of the Head of the Ulna. There is another Flexor which arises from the Exter- nal Condyle of the Humerus, and, after extending some way along the upper portion of the Ulna, is fixed to the outer part of that Bone. The Extensor Cubiti is eomposed of two portions, one from the Scapula, the other

Part II.] OF BIRDS. ^ After the Membrane has been drawn to the outer corner of the Eye, it is returned !)y its own elasticity. The Lacrymal Gland^ in Birds, is commonly small. It is situated at the outer angle, and sends out the Tears in some, as the Common Fowl, by one, and in others, by two or throe small Canals, through the Up- per Eye-lid. The Glandula Harderi is also found here ; it is of a fleshy colour, and considerably larger than the Lacry- mal Gland. It is commonly placed between the Le- vator and Adductor Oculi, and discharges, by a single Duct, a yellowish fluid upon the inner surface of the third Palpebra. In the Duck tribe and the Water Birds, there is a large Glandular Body in the upper part of the Orbit, which seems to supply the place of the Lacrymal Gland, yet no Duct has been traced from it. All Birds have two Puncta Lacrymalia, but no Ca- runcvla Lacrymalis. The passages from the Puncta terminate in the Nasal Sac, situated in the Palate, at the base of the Nose. The Sclerotic Coat forms little more than a hemi- sphere in this class, and to its anterior flat part is at- tached the Cornea, making a section of a smaller globe. In consequence of the flatness of the anteiior part of the Eye, it is prevented from being injured when the Animal is scrambling among bushes, or taking a rapid flight through the air. The fore part of the Sclerotis divides into two Lami- nae, between w'hich there are numerous Osseous Plates, y/hich overlap each other, and form a Ring, commonly flat.

A pair of Nerves belong to the Muscles of the Sac, and another to the Organ of Hearing. A pair near the Heart forms a Plexus, which supplies the dif- ferent Viscera. In the Sepia Loliffo, the Brain consists of a small round Body, behind which are two little Lobes analogous to the Cerebellum. These send off a mere Filament in place of a Spinal Marrow. On each side of the Brain is a large mass, which sends off the Optic Nerve. In the Snail and Slug, the Brain is ^situated, in the former over, and in the latter behind, the Esopha- gus, and sends off a Process on each side of it, both u- niting below into a large Ganglion, from which and the ' Brain, Nerv'es are sent to tlie different parts of the Body. Eye.â€”The Sepia alone of this class of Animals possess- es true Eyes. Here we observe their great size, and the Skin covering them loosely as in Serpents; a transpa- rent Membrane underneath, which supplies the place of a Cornea, and to which the Lens is closely connected without the intervention of an Aqueous Humour; the Iris intimately connected to the Sclerotica, and a Semi- lunar Process projecting at the edge of the Pupil; the Ciliary Processes large, and forming a Zone about the Lens; between the Sclerotic and Choroid Coats, Glan- dular Bodies and the Ganglion of the Optic Nerve, which separate these two Coats from each other; the inner sur-, face of the Choroides of a deep purple colour, and only two Muscles belonging to the Ball of the Eye. The parts consitlcrcd as the Eye of Mollusca with Tentacula, or Horns, as the Snail and Slug, are pla- ced

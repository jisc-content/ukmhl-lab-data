OF MAMMALIA. Part I.] 1.^5 the two Authors mentioned above, as being originally deposited from the Capsule which forms the Enamel. It fills the interstices on the surface of the different layers of the Enamel, and unites the layers together. It is the softest of the three component parts of the Tooth, and is more readily affected by acids and fire than the Osseous substance. It is sometimes, as in the Cow, Sheep, &c. not completely formed in the centre of the Tooth, in consequence of which Cavities are left, which become filled with extraneous matter. The Enamel in the centre of the Incisores of the Horse has no Crusta Petrosa, but is filled with blackish Tartar, which extends only a short way into the Tooth, of course soon disappears, in consequence of mastica- tion. This is termed by Farriers the filling up of the Teeth, or rather Mark of the Mouth, and forms a cri- terion of the Animal’s age. In many Animals which do not ruminate, as SoUpeds and the Elephant, the Bodies or Crowns of the Mola- res have their grinding surfaces placed nearly in a hori- zontal direction. In Ruminants, their surface is some- what oblique, the outer margin of the Upper, and the inner margin of the Under Tooth, being the most pro- minent. In the greatest part of the Feroe, especially of the Dog and Tiger kind, where the Molares are of an irre- gular wedge shape, the lower ones close within the up- per, and act like scissars. All the three sets of Teeth exist in the Ape tribe, in Carnivora, in Solipeds, and in Ruminants naturally deg- iiuit« I

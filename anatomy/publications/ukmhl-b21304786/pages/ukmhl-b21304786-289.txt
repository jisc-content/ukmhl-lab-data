28^ Part IILJ OF REPTILES. Cartilaginous Rings,’ though with some exceptions, a.s in the Crocodile, Chameleon, and Serpents. In these last, it has the appearance of being a complete pij)e. The proportion of the Bronchi, compared to the Trachea, is as in Birds; but in Serpents, there are large dilatations. In some of the Turtle and Croeodile kind, the Bron- chi form convolutions; and in some, the Trachea di- vides so soon, as to appear to be double. In most other Reptiles, the Bronchi are very short. For the most part, the Bronchi do not divide, and commonly do not enter into the substance of the Lungs, but terminate abruptly in them by one or more large orifices. The Lungs here, as in Birds, are in the same com- mon Cavity with the other ^ iscera, but vary more in shape and size than in the two former classes. 1 hey form most frequently two oval Sacs, which, in the Turtle kind, extend by the sides of the S[)ine, as far as the Pelvis, and above all the other ^ iscera. I hey dif- fer from those of Birds by the gi’eater size of their Ceils, and the looseness of their texture. In the Turtle, they arc more complicated than in the rest of the individuals of this class, approaching more in their structiu*e to the Lungs of Birds. The Branches of the Bronchi communicate, each by an orifice, with a pai'ticular Sac, the walls of which form Polygonal Cells, varying according to the kind of the Animal. In the Croeodile, the Cells are smaller than in the Turtle. Jn Lizards, Frogs, and Se?pcnts, the I.ungs have, at their anterior part, a Cavity, the walls of which are formed

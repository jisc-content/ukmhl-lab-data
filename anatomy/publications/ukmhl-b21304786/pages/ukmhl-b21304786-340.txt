[Part IV. OF THE LIVER, &c. 334 sion into some j>art of the Gall-Bladder or its Ducts, or into both at the same time. The Hepato-Cystic Ducts are commonly short, which facilitates the motion of the Bile. In the Turbot^ Cut-Jiah^ 8zc. these Ducts are nu- merous, and go into the Gall-Bladder. In the Sole, Perch, and many others, they go in succc'ssion into the Cystic Duct. In the Skate, Salmon, &c. they go partly to the Gall-Bladder, and partly to the Cystic Duct. Pancreas.—In Osseous Fishes, there is no other Pan- creas than the Intestinula Caeca formerly described. They send two large Canals into the Intestines, and when these are wanting, as is the case in the Carp, &c. the walls of the Intestines discharge abundance of Hu- mour from Glands placed upon their inner surface. In Cartilaginous Fishes, as the Skate, there is a Pancreas resembling that in the former classes of Ani- mals. It is of an irregular form, and is placed at the origin of the Intestines. The substance appears com- pact, but Gelatinous, when cut. ‘ In the Sturgeon, the Pancreas forms a sort of medium between that in the Skate, and the Intestinula Caeca in the Osseous Fishes; it opens into the Intestine by three large Orifices, and has internally a singular reticulated appearance. Spleen.—The Spleen gradually diminishes in propor-^ tional size from Mammalm to Fishes. In the Raja and Squalus, it is placed on the Stomach ; in some it is fixed to the first part of the Intestines; in others, between the Stomach and Liver; in a great number, it is under the Air-bag, and above the other liowels : In all, it is fixed in its place by the Peritoneum. It varies consi- derably

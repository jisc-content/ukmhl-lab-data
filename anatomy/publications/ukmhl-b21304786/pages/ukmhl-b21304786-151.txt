Part I.] 145 OF MAMMALIA. Posterior Nares, above the Velum Palati. Between the Thyroid and Arytenoid Cartilages there is a deep cavi- ty, by which the drink passes, while the Glottis remains open, and the Animal blows the drink into the mouth, after pumping it with the Proboscis. The other parts of the Larynx have the ordinary structui*e. In the Cetacea the Larynx forms a conical Tube> which penetrates the back-part of the Nostrils, to allow the Aliment to pass by its sides. The Tube is formed by the Arytenoid Cartilages and Epiglottis. It has neither Glottis nor vocal Ligaments, and it is generally supposed that there is no voice here, there being no Organs for the purpose. The Muscular Fibres of the Pharynx form a particular Canal, which goes to the posterior Nares, so as to intercept the communication between the Nostrils, Mouth, and Pharynx. The Muscles of the Larynx in Quadrupeds agree in general with those in Man, varying chiefly according to the form of the Cartilages, and the different cavities be- longing to them. Thyroid Gland.â€”This substance belongs to Mamma- lia alone. In the different Genera of the class, it is proportionally smaller than in Man, but otherwise ap- pears to be similarly situated, and to have a similar structure. It is constantly composed of tw'o Lateral Portions, and occasionally surrounds a part of the Trachea. It is plentifully supplied with Blood-vessels, but is destitute of any Excretory Duct. In the different orders of the class it varies in the form and size of its Lobes, which in some, as in Man, VoL. IV. K ara

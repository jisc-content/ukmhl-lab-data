Part IIL] OF REPTILES. ‘ 261 The last Vertebra of the Tail in the Rattle-snake sup- ports the Rattle. The Sternum is wanting, and, there being no Limbs, the Bones of the E?:tremities of course are absent. OF THE MUSCLES. ^r'liE two principal divisions of the Animals of tlifs class, viz. those with, and those without Feet, have a remarkable difference in the form and number of theiif Muscles. In the former, viz. the Turtle^ F'og^ &c where the Trunk of the Body possesses proportionally a small degree of mobility, a number of Muscles are wanting, though the others ai’e strong. In the Animals of this class without Feet, namely, the Serpents, the Muscles are slender, but extremely numerous, on ac- count of the number of the Vertebrae, and the Avant of Anterior and Posterior Extremities. In the Turtle, the Spine possesses no motion but in the parts belonging to the Neck and Tail. The Back and Loins, being ossified together, have no Muscles. Tlie Diaphragm, and also the Muscles of the Abdo- men, are Avanting; but the other Muscles are remark- ably strong. The Neck possesses chiefly Muscles for elongation and retraction; the Neck being bent, Avhen retracted into the Shell, someAvhat like a Z, though it can be moved in various directions Avhen it protrudes from the Shell. The INIuscles for these motions are nu- R 3 merous.

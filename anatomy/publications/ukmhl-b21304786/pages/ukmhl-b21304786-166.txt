OF THE INTESTINES [Part I. ICO found througli the whole length of the posterior extre- mity of the small Intestine. OJ the Intestines in particular.â€”In the Ape kind, the Intestinal Canal bears a strong resemblance to that of Man; but the whole of them, except the Ourangs, want the Appendix Vei'miformis. Tlie Bradypoda have the Canal of a moderate length, most of the Animals of this class being of the Carnivorous kind. The Sloth^ on the contrary, living on vegetables, is remarkable for the sliortness of the Intestines. In the Ornlthorrynchus.f the structure of the Intestines differs from that in other Mammalia. There are many transverse Pliem resembling those in Fishes ; the Cae- cum is in form of an Appendix Vermiformis ; the Co- lon enlarges towards its outer extremity, forming a Cloaca, as in Birds. It has many Sinuosities in the right Hypochondrium ; and upon the inner Membrane, Plicae run in a longitudinal direction. The Bat tribe, though Carnivorous, has a Cellular Colon and a lai-ge Caecum. They have the Intestinal Canal the shortest of any of the Quadrupeds, being only once and a half, or twice the length of the Body. In the Vespertilio Vampyr-us, on the contrary, or RousettCy whicli lives on vegetables, it is proportionally longer than in the Human Body. Among the Glires or Rodentia, which feed upon ve- getables, the Intestines are from six to sixteen times the length of the Body; but their diameter is not very con- siderable, though there is generally a very large Caecum. / In

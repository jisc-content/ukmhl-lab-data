238 OF THE ALIMENTARY CANAL [Part II. The OF THE ALIMENTARY CANAL. The ^'iscera of the Abdomen, in Birds, are contained in the same common Cavity with those of the Thorax, and, as in the former class, are covered by the Perito- neum, which is here so confounded with the Pleura, that the two may be considered as one Membrane. The Animals of this class being divided into Grani-. vorous and Carnivorous, the Bowels of the two kinds are considerably different from each other. The upper part of the Esophagus agrees in its nature in Birds in general; but in a few, there are peculiari- ties. In the Pelican, there is a remarkable dilatation or Pouch in the Fauces, capable of holding some quarts, and serving as a reservoir of the Food, which commonly consists of Fishes. There is also, in the Male Bustard, a Throat-Sac under the Skin of the Neck, which has an opening of considerable size under the Tongue, but the use is un- known. Granivorous ^irds. The Esophagus is generally a little inclined to the right side of the Trachea, and terminates at the bottom of the Neck in a large Sac, the Ingluvies or Crop, which is of the same structure with the Esophagus, but thinner.

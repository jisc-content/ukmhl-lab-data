[Part T. OF THE EYE Jids, and communicate by a Gixwvc witli the inner angle of the Eye. In the Elephant^ the Lacrymal Organs have not been found; and in the Cctacca, as in most Animals living constantly in the wateiv they are wanting. The Tunica Conjunctiva agrees, in general, with that in Man, varying only a little in colour over the Tunica Sclerotica. The Cornea, in Quadrupeds, is not quite circular, being somewhat wider in a transverse than in a longitudi- nal direction. It varies a little in convexity in different Animals, and also in its proportion with respect to the Sclerotica. In' all it is composed, as in IMan, of trans- 'parent thin INIembranes, closely united. The Iris exhibits great variety in colour in different Animals. Each Species, in the wild state, is observed to have a fixed colour : but this varies in domes- tic Animals, though less than in the Human Spe- cies. These variations are found to correspond, in some measure, with the colour of the Hair ? and in party-coloured Animals, a mixture of colours has been observed in the Iris. A Fibrous structure appears in the Iris of some Animals, as the Ox, which Du ]\Ionro thinks, if Muscular, may affect the Pupil. Blumen- Dach has not been able to discover true Muscular Fibres in the Iris even of the Elephant and Whale. The motions of the Iris in the whole Animals of this class are involuntary. 'I'he form and size of the Pupil correspond Avith the Animars manner of life. In the Ape kind, and many Carnivora, it is round as in Man. In Solipc(hâ€˜, Ruminantx, and Cetacea, it is transversely oblong.

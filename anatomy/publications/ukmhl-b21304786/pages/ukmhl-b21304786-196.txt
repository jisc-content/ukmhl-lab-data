190 OF THE EEMALE organs [Faut I. In a few, as tlie Hyena, Dolpli'm, and Porpoise, the Rug-as run transversely, but exist only at the outer half of the Canal. In large Animals, the walls of the Va- gina, according to C'uvier, possess Muscular Fibres, which run both in a longitudinal and in a transverse di- rection. In the Ormthorrynchns, there is no Vagina. Vulva.—This, in some Animals, as the Rat, forms a longitudinal slit; in others, as the Hyena, it passes transversely. In some of the Glires, it is of a circular form, and sometimes, esjiecially in Animals Avith a Pouch, it is inclosed with the Anus in a circle. The existence of a Hymen in Quadrupeds, resem- bling in form and situation that of the Human Subject, is asserted by some late Authors of the first eminence, and denied by others of equal celebrity. In the Dog, Cat, Ruminants, &c, the Vagina is se- })arated from the Vulva, by a contracted circle, and in other Animals, by one or more Plica?, which are found to be effaced by coition, or bv one or more litters. In the Dear, Hyena, Alare^ and Ass, never yet covered, a strong Semilunar Fold appears in the under part of the orifice of the Vagina, which has been considered by .some as analogous to a Hymen, though this is no very strict resemblance to that hi the Human Female. At the under end of the Vulva, the Urethra is com- monly situated, and appears at the outer orifice of the Vagina, though, in many Animals, the orifice of the Urethra is a considerable way in from the \'ulva. The Nymphee are wanting in IMammalia; but the want of them is sujiplied, in coition, by the quantity of Rlood whicli distends the AT’ssels at this time. In place of

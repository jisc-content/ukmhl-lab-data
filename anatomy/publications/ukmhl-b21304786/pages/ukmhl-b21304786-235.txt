Paut It.] OF BIRDS.. P 3 The OF THE HEART AND BLOOD^ VESSELS, > The Heart cotresponcls in its pi-incipal parts with that in Mammalia. It has four cavities, whicli have the same general appearance, and transmit the Blood in the same mannei‚Äù. It is of a conical form, but the cone varies in length or in roundness in different Birds. The situation is nearly the same as in Mammalia, but nearer the an- terior part of the Thorax. The Petlcard'mm is covered by the Membrane formed by the Pleura and Peritoneum. 7 he Auricles have no Appendices externally. The Ventricles have Columnae Carneie in proportion to their thickness and strength. The Valve corresponding with the d'ricLispid in Mammalia, is peculiar, in being formed of a strong fleshy flap, while the other Valves resemble those in the former class. '1 he Pulmonary Artery is proportionally small,' the Lungs occupying less space. 'rhe Aorta divides near its origin into three smaller f Aortae. riic rifjht foians the Posterior or Descendinff Aorta, the other two form the Subclavian Arteries. I'he Subclavians give off the Carotids, Vertebrals, Branches to the Neck and Thorax, then divide into Radial and Ulnar, which are dispersed on the Wings.

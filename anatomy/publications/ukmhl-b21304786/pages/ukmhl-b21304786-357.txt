Sepai’ate Sexes without copulation, as in the Cuttle-Fish, and other Cephalopoda; 3. 'I'he Sexes united with reciprocal copulation, as in the Slug, and the greater part of the other Gasteropoda; 4. The Sexes united, and each individual fecundating itself, or forming a complete Hermaphrodite, as in the Oyster and other Acephala. In the Sepia Loligo, the Testicle is a large white Body, filling the bottom of the Abdominal Sac, and inclosed in a Membranous Capsule, to which it adheres at one part by Vessels. It is composed of Seminal Tubes, which occupy the greater part of its substance. The Testicle has connected with it an Epididymis formed of innumerable convolutions, as in the Human Body. There is here, also, a substance somewhat ana- logous to a Prostate Gland, and a fleshy Organ, hollow within, and perforated at the point, which is consider- ed as the Penis. This receives the Semen from the parts mentioned above, and projects in the Neck at the side of the left Branchia. The Semen, Ink, and Ex- crementitious Matter, pass through an Infundibulum placed under the Neck. In the Female, the Ova occu- py the same place as the Testicle in the Male, and are covered

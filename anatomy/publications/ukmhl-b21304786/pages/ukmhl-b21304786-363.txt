357 OF CRUSTACEA. Faux VI.] this sense resides in the Antennae. The Salivary Glands appear also to be wanting in the Animals of this class. Circulating System.—The Heart., in some, as the Crab., is placed near the middle of the Thorax, and is of an oval form, but has no Auricle ; in others, as the Shrimp, it runs from one end of the Body to the other, like a Blood-vessel. The Heart here, as in the Mollus- ca Gasteropoda, receives the Blood from the Branchiae by one or more Veins, and sends out Arteries, which go to the different parts of the Body. From the extre- mities of the Arteries, Veins return by a Cava, which divides into Branchial Arteries upon approaching the Gills. Organs of Respiration.—In the Crustacea, the Or- gans of Respiration consist of a set of Branchim, or Gills, which are proportionally larger than in most of the Animals of the former class. In the Cancer tribe, they are placed at the sides of the Thorax, and near the origin of the Feet. In some, as the Shrimp, they lie under the Tail between the Fins, floating loose- ly in the water. '1 he Gills vary in number and form in , different Genera and Species; but in all, they are near- ly of the same nature with the Gills of Fishes, and have the water constantly applied to them, so as to an- swer the different purposes of Respiration. Alimentary Canal.—The Stomach is singular in this dlass, especially in the Crab, Lobster, &c. in being form- ed upon a kind of Osseous Skeleton. Near the Pylorus are five Teeth of unequal size, wdiich, in some of these Animals, as the Lobster, are observed to be re-produced annually along with their external covering. The Teeth Z 3 are

32S OF THE HEART, &c. [Part IV. couple of Branches, which are distributed upon these Organs. In otlier Fishes, as the Cod, Salmon, &c. this Artery sends off' Branches in a similar manner, but only four in number in each side, corresponding with the number of the Branchiae. From the Gills the Blood returns, and is sent to all the parts of the Body by a set of Arterious Veins, or Branches, which are found to be of the same thickness and strength with those of the Branchial Artery. In the Slate tribe, these Vessels, in number equal to that of the Gills, pass back under the Cartilage of the Neck, and join their fellows of the opposite side, to form the Aorta. Before they unite, they give Branches to the Neck, Head, &c. and furnish the Coronary Arteries of the Heart. The beginning of the Aorta sends a large Artery to each of the Lateral Fins, and parts adjacent, and soon after, the Cocliac and two Mesenteries to the Chylo- poictic and Assistant Chylopoietic Viscera; then Arte- ries to the Organs of Urine and Generation, and two large Branches to the Posterior Fins. The continuation of the Aorta goes at last to the Tail, protected in a Ca- nal in the inferior part of the Vertebi'ae. In other Fishes, the Aorta is formed by only four Branches on each side, corresponding with the number ot the Gills. In some Fishes, as the Sturgeon, the Aorta is almost entirely concealed in a Canal in the Bodies of the \eriebrae. Veins.â€”The eins, in this class of Animals, are ex- tremely thin in their Coats.

ARRANGEMENT OF ANIMALS. 14 CLASS I. A. Vertebral warm-blooded Animals. Mammalia. In the Mammalia, the Females are viviparous, and suckle their young. The greater number of them are Quadrupeds, and these, for the most part, are covered with Hair, and walk on the Earth ; the rest have a sleek Skin, and inhabit the Ocean. They consist of the following Orders : ^ 1. Bimanum.—Two-handed, Thumbs separate on the Superior Extremities only. Homo, Man. 2. Quadrumana.—Four-handed, the Thumb or Great Toe capable of being opposed to the other Fingers or Toes on each of the four Extremities. Simiw, Apes, which have no Tails ; Baboons, which have short Tails; and Monkeys, which have long Tails. Lemur, Makis or Macoucos, (a kind of link be- tween the Simiae and other Quadrupeds ; hav- ing the hand-like Paw and Flat Nail of the former, and the crooked Nail of the latter.) 3. Brydafoda.—Slow-moving Animals, with their Bo- dies generally covered by a hard crust. Some 'want the Incisor Teeth; others want the Incisors and Cus- pidati; in others, the Jaws are destitute of Teeth. Brady pus, or Sloth. Mermc^

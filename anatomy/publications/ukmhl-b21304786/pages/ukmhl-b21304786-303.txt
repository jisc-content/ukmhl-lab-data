OP FISHES. m Part IV.] articulated witli the Cranium, but through the me- dium of the Bone, analogous to the Os Quadratum in Birds. In each side of the Cranium of Osseous Fishes, as in Birds, there is a great moveable Bone, which supports the Palatine Ai-ches and the Lower Jaw. In the SqxmliisoY kind, the two Jaws are very move- able. Each is composed of a pair of Cartilages, joined at the fore part. The Upper has two Condyles, by which it is articulated with the Lower Jaw. It has also two small Inter-articular Cartilages. Nearly the same structure is found in the Sturgeon. The Teeth of Fishes vary in form, number, and .si- tuation, and, strictly speaking, are a set of hard pro- minent Bodies, placed in some part of the Mouth, or Throat, merely for grasping their prey, and preventing it from escaping, their Food not requiring manduca- tion. Some Species of Spams have Front Teeth, .simple, and with Fangs fixed in the Alveoli, almost si- milar to those in the Human Body. In general, simple Teeth, with Fangs in the Alveoli, are a continuation of the Alveoli, but differing from them in their structure, and they are covered with Ena- mel, as in Mammalia. In some, as the Squalus, the Teeth arc also siinple, but joined only to the Gums, and grow in the manner of Epij)hyses. In some, the Teeth are conical and blunt; in others, flat and round, or simply round ; or some have them sharp, and in the form of wedges. In the Shark, the Teeth are very numerous, but without Fangs, and arc placed in rows, 'i he front row only is perpendicular, and exposed; the rest arc small-

[Part III. 272 OF THE EAR the Skin. It is wanting, also, in the generality of Ser~ pcnts. A Tympanum, Eustachian Tube, and Semicircular Canals, are present in the Turtle, Frog, and in most Lizards. In the Turtle, the Tympanum is in some measure divided into two parts by a contraction, which is more distinct in tlie Crocodile, where the inner apart- ment has Cells, somewhat like those in the Mastoid Pro- cess in the Human Species, hut larger. In Lizards, the Frog, Toad, ttc. the 'Fynipanum is Membranous ^be- hind, and has a short but large Eustachian Tube, which communicates with the Mouth. There is neither Tympanum nor Eustachian Tube in Serpents, and a few others ; but a rudiment of a Carti- laginous Ossiculum exists in some, which is inclosed in Muscular matter, the inner extremity occupying the Fenestra Ovalis. In the Turtle and Lizards, as in Birds, there is a simple Ossiculum 'Juditus, with a small Cartilaginous Stalk, which is joined to the Membrana Tympani. 'I'he Frog and Toad have two Cartilaginous Ossicula, one joined to the Membrana 'lympani, the other articulated with it, and with the Fenestra Ovalis. In Serpents, thei-e is a rudiment of an Ossiculum, the outer end of w hich touches the Skin, the inner the Fe- nestra Ovalis. Of the Muscles of the Ossicula, little is known in Reptiles. The Semicircular Canals, in many of the individuak of this class, approach to a circle; each has an Am- pulla, and. there is a Sac in place of a Vestihle ; but the Fenestra Rotunda, and a complete Cochlea, are wanting, though

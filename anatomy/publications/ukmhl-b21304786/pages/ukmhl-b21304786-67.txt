Part I.] 61 OF MAMMALIA. Osseous Snout, by several Muscles, In the Mole and the Hog, they extend from the side of the Head and Bones of the Upper Jaw, and terminate by Tendons which are placed round the Nasal Tube. They serve for raising or depressing the Snout; or, by the action of the Muscles of the same side, it is turned laterally. The Snout in both of these Animals is surrounded by Annular Fibres, which are a continuation of the Orbi- cular Muscle of the Lips. In Solipeds, besides Muscles analogous to the Levator Labii Superioris Alaeque Nasi in Man, there are others arising from the Bones in the neighbourhood, and fixed to the Nostrils, of which four are described by Authors, viz. the Pyramidalis, belonging also to the Mouth; the Transversalis, which runs parallel to the Orbicularis Oris ; the Musculiis Brevis, which goes from the Nasal Bone to the False Naris; and the Musculiis Maxillaris, serving for the dilation and contraction of the Naris. Ruminants have the Muscles of the Nose less compli- cated : two arise from the Os Maxillare, and go to the upper, outer, and under edges of the Nostril. The Proboscis of the Elephant has, between the Ex- ternal Integuments and the two Tubes which it con- tains, a thick Fleshy Layer, composed of two sets of small Muscles, or fasciculated Fibres; an inner one, running in a transverse, and an outer one, in a longi- tudinal direction. Of the Transverse Fasciculi, some run across the Proboscis, others in a radiated, and some in an oblique direction, between the surface of the 'Pubes and the inner part of the longitudinal Fibres. These form the inner part or body of the Organ. 'I'he radiated

Part L] OF MAMMALIA. 181 ferentia, or separately. They are like the Vesiculae Se- mlnales in structure, and increase like them at rutting- time. They are observed also to be filled, apparently Avith the same kind of liquor. They exist in most of the Glires, as the Rat, and in the Hedge-hog and Mole among the Camivora, but ap- pear to be Avanting in the other Mammalia, the Ho7‘se excepted, in Avhich there is a cylindrical Vesicle placed betAveen the Vasa Deferentia, and terminating in the Urethra, before the openings of the Vesiculae Seminales and Vasa Deferentia. Prostate Gland.—The Prostate Gland, or something analogous to it, appears to exist in all the Mammalia, but A’aries exceedingly in its appearance in the different Species. In some, as the Dog and Cat tribe, it is single : in others, as Ruminants, it is double. In a small number, as the Horse and Elephant, it is qua- druple ; and in the Bat, it is lobulated. In most of the Animals of the class, the structure is :is in Man. In others, as the Horse, Ruminants, and the Elephant, it has Cavities A\ithin. In the Cetacea, it is Cellular, and of great proportional size. It gene- rally surrounds the beginning of the Urethra, and ter- minates in that Canal, by one or more openings, at the side of the Verumontanum, though sometimes consi- derably farther forAvards. In the Horse and Elephant, the Prostates are covered by Muscular Fibres, Avhich proceed from the sides of the Bladder. In most of the Glires, and in the Hedge-hog and M 3 Mole,

109 Part L] OF MAMMALIA. are numerous, to provide as large a surface as possible within the confined space of the Cavity of the Nose. In Apes, the Ossa Spongiosa Inferiora, sen Poste- riora, in some of their Species, resemble those in Man; but in others, they approach those of the Feroe and Belluce. In all these Animals, the Lamina in each Nostril is simple at its base, but is forked at a little dis- . tance from this; each of the two Laminae that grow from it, coiling up into tw'O or two and a half turns, according to the Species. The Plates forming the In- ferior Concha contain two Canals, one above, the other below, the principal Lamina ; the inferior leading into the Posterior Nares. The Inferior Spongy Bones are perforated by nume- rous Holes of different size ; but in the Pig, the Lami- nae are impervious. In Sollpeds, the Inferior Concha is less regular than in the Animals mentioned above; instead of forking at the base, it bends first down, then up, and is attached to the Maxillary Bone. Among the Glires, the Hare, Squirrel, and Rat kind, and in the Ferae, the Dog and Cat trib, the Bear, Seal, &c. have the Inferior Spongy Bone ex- tremely complicated. Tire first Lamina is forked, and each Branch subdivided. The last Laminae form a number of parallel Canals for the passage of the air, and the distribution of the Nerves. The number of Laminae in the Inferior Conchae is very variable, d he Seal and Otter are observed to have them in greatest abundance. Next to these come the Dog and Bear. Among the Glires, the Beaver has most, and the Hare least of them.. In some of the Ferae,

277 OF REPTILES. Paet Ill.j The Ventricles have Cavities small in proportion to their external appearance, owing to the great thickness of their walls. Internally they have, in the three first or- ders or tribes, numerous Columna.' Carneas. In the Turtle kind, there is a strong Pericardium, united to the Peritoneum, in the manner the Diaphragm is united to the Pericardium in the Human Body. 'J he two Auricles are separated by a complete parti- tion. The two Cavae terminate in the Right Auricle, where there are two Valves, and the Pulmonary Veins in the Left, where there are also a pair of Valves. Each Auricle communicates with a corresponding I'en- tricle. I'he two Vcntiicles communicate by a large opening. In the Right Ventricle, there is a hollow Muscular Valve, which prevents the return of the Blood to the I.,eft. The Arteries arise from the Right \Tntricle only. They come off' in three large Trunks, or there are three Aortay two of which go to the Abdomen. The Right is the projyer Abdominal Aorta; the Left, the Ductus Communicativus of Merv ; and Third, the Pulmonary Artery. In consequence of this structure, the Aortic Circula- tion can proceed without interruption while the Animal is under water, which is diff'erent from what happens in the two former classes. In the Lizard tribe, the Pericardium adheres, as in the Tortoise^ to the Peritoneum, which covers the con- vexity of the Liver. The Auricles are in general simi- lar to those of the Tortoise, but the Ventricle is observ- ed to varv much in certain Genera and Species of this S .‘I oi’der

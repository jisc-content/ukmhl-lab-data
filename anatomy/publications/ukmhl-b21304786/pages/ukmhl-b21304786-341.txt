In some it is remarkable for its length. OF THE URINARY ORGANS. Fishes in general have Kidneys ; some have a Bladder of Urine, and others want it. The Kidneys are large in proportion, but smaUer in the Raja and Squalus than in other Fishes. In the greater number they are long, narrow, and united apparently into one mass. They adhere to the Spine from the posterior part of the Ab- domen to near the Orbits, and have the Peritoneum extended over their under surface. They are uniform in their substance, soft, and of a reddish brown colour. Renal Glands are wanting in this class. The Ureters begin by numerous roots, and run along the under surface of the Kidneys. They terminate ei- ther in a Vesica Urinaria or a Cloaca ; or unite together to form a dilatation, which supplies the place of a Blad- der of Urine. The Urinary Bladder is very variable here. It is wanting in the Raja and Squalus; in these the Ureters end in a Cloaca, as in Birds, in other Cartilaginous Fishes, it is present, but is proportionally small, and is thin

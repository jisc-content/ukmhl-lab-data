t5G2 OF INSECTS. {Part VII. In some, it is directly continued from the Breast; in others, thei e is an evident contraction between them, and a real Joint connected by Ligaments. Sometimes the Abdomen is terminated by a Sting, by Bristles, IMates, &c. Members or Feet, and Wings.â€”In winged Insects, the number of the Feet is generally six, never less, but frequently more ; Scorpions, Spiders, &c. have eight; Millipedes and Scolopendra, or Centipedes, have them attached to every ring of the Body. The Feet consist of the Coxa or Haunch, the Femur or Thigh, the Ti- bia or Leg, the J'arsus or Toe. Each of these is in- closed in a horny case, and moves as on a hinge. The Toe consists, in general, of several Joints, the last of which is terminated by one or two hooked Claws. The Articulations vary according to the mode of life. They are slender in many that burrow in the earth, as in the Scarahccus. They are like Fans, and ciliated on the sides in those that swim, as in the Hydrophilus, or Diver. They have Viscous Balls, bi'istly Tufts, &c. in such as walk in smooth and slippery parts, as in the common Fly. In Insects that crawl upon Hairs, there are two moveable and opposite Claws, as in Lice, tkc. F/ach of the Joints of the Feet is furnished with an Fxtensor and a Flexor Muscle, inclosed in the preced- ing Joint. The Wings are attached to the lateral parts of the Pectus. I'he greater number of Insects have four, some only tw'o, some none. In some, they are purely Mem- branous ; others liave them covered with Farinaceous Scales

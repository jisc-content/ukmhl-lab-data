These consist chiefly in its being much smaller in pi'oportion to the Body, and also to the Cerebellum and Spinal INIarrow, but more particulai'ly to the Nerves arising from it. To this last circumstance there aie no exceptions, though there are several to the others. Some of the Ape and Mouse kind equal Man in the proportion of the size of the Brain, and certain Birds surpass him ; but, according to Soemmerring and Elbe, the size of the Brain, to the Nei’ves arising from it, bears an exact ratio to the faculties of the Ani- mal’s Mind; and though, in some small Anlmal.s, the Brain is proportionally larger to the size of the Body than in Man, yet all, even the Monkey tribe, are far inferior to him in respect to the proportion between the Brain and Nerves. It is difficult to ascertain the exact proportion the Brain bears to the rest of the Body, on account of the diffe- rent

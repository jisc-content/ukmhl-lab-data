DF MAMMALIA. 115 Part I.J chiefly in the extensibility of its fore or loose part. In some Animals, as the Ant-eater^ Armadillo^ and Ornl~ thorrynchus, the Tongue is the longest in all the Mam- malia, for seizing their prey. In the Cetacea, on the contrary, it is almost entirely fixed down to the Jaw; but in Quadrupeds in general, it is nearly as loose as in the Human Body. In some Animals, it serves'as an Organ of taste; in others it is also employed for taking in the Food. In most Quadrupeds, it is proportionally longer and narrower than in Man, and possesses the same kind of Papillag, the chief difference being in their form.

These, like so many tenter-hooks, assist in laying hold of the grass, and other kinds of Food, and serve, at the same time, to increase the.Organ of taste, lii some of the Monkey tribe, the Papillse Maximae are fewer in number, and differently disposed from those in Man.

In the Cat kind, besides many round and conical Papillae, there is a horny or prickly set covering the Tongue, which render it rougher, and enable it to take a firmer hold of the prey. The Dog has upon the Mouth and root of the Tongue, many Papillae, placed obliquely backward.*;, which assist in preventing the Food from escaping.

The Anterior Extremities in Mammalia can be di- vided nearly as the Superior Extremities of the Human Body, though in some of the individuals of the class, they vary considerably from the corresponding parts in Man. Most Quadrupeds want Clavicles, in consequence of which, the Anterior Extremities come nearer each other, and their pi'ogfessive motiorl is rendered easier. The Clavicles are found in all Quadrupeds which use their Anterior Extremities much for other purposes be- sides walking. They exist in the Ape tribe, and there they resemble those in Man.

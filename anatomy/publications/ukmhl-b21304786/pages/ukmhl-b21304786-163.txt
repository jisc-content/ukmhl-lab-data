I Part I.] OF MAMMALIA. 157 former having the Canal shorter, and others longer, in proportion. In the Wild Boar and Cat, the lengtli of the Canal, compared with that of the Body, has been found much less than in the tame Animals of the same Species. In the Wild Rabbit, on the contrary, it is- considerably greater than in the tame one. Mammalia, as well as most other Vertebral Animals,, have a distinction into Small and Great Intestines. The Small are commonly the longest, and are Villous â€¢within. The Large are thicker in their Muscular and Internal Coats, and are seldom furnished with Villi in- ternally ; which last circumstance forms a distinction between the two parts of the Canal, when other marks are deficient. In Carnivorous Animals, the Canal is generally more nearly equal in size than in the Herbivorous. The Muscular Coat is proportionally stronger, and there are no distinct Valvulae Conniventes. From these cir- cumstances, and also from the nature of the Aliment, the process of digestion is in them more quickly per- formed. The Horse and Elephant are remarkable for the di- mensions of their Colon, which, in the former, is several yards in length, while in a middle-sized Hog, it is only found to be about eight or ten inches long. ' Many Quadrupeds, as the Badger, Rell Mouse, &c. have no distinction into small and great Intestines ; but in such Animals, an Appendix or Caecum forms the boundary between the parts corresponding with these* Where there is no Appendix or Caecum, a Valve, cor- responding to the Valvula Coli, points out the differ- ence ;

143 Part I.] OF MAMMALIA. Among the GUres^ some, as the Porcupine, have scarcely any vocal organs; others, as the Rat, have them more distinct. In the Ferae, \X\q Bear tribe have a singular Larynx. The Cuneiform Cartilages are in form of stilets, with the posterior extremities on the outside of the Aryte- noid Cartilages. The Kangaroo has the Arytenoid Cartilages remark- ably large, but neither Ventricles nor Ligaments of the Glottis. There is a great difference in the structure of the La- rynx among the Ferae. The Dog tribe has a triangular Epiglottis, and large Cuneiform Cartilages projecting outwards, with distinctly marked vocal Ligaments. The Ventricles of the Larynx, in these Animals, are two deep chinks, opening, not into the cavity of the La- rynx, but towards the surface of the Epiglottis. The opening between the Epiglottis and Arytenoid Carti- lages, is in form of anyT The Cat has two Membranes under the Posterior Li- gaments of the Glottis, which are considered as the cause of the purring noise peculiar to that Animal. In the Cat, Lion, Tiger, and other Animals of this family, the Superior or Anterior Ligaments appear to be the vocal; the Ventricles are wanting. The Horse has no anterior Ligaments of the Glottis, nor Ventricles strictly so called, but a Falciform Mem- brane, attached by its middle to the Thyroid Cartilage, while its extremities run along the external edges of the Rima Glottidis. This structure is considered as the cause of neighing in that Animal. Before the vocal I-igaments

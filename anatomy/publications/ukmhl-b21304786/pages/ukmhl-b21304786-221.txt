’Paat II.] ^15 •OF BIRDS. I ciduni. The Corpora Striata are of uniform colour in- ternally. The Tkalami ai*e two roundish Tubercles lying un- ,der the Hemispheres, without being inclosed by them. Between the Thalami and Corpora Striata are com- .monly four Eminences, which do not appear in Man. The Lateral Ventricles do not turn down behind to form the inferior Cornua ; of course, the Cornua Ammonis are absent. The Lateral Ventricles, in Birds, are distin- guished from those of all other Animals, by the radiated partition which separates them from each other. Tliey communicate with each other, and with the Third Ven- tricle. The *rhird Ventricle is situated between the Thalami, and communicates with the Infundibulum, and also with the Fourth Ventricle ; but the passage into this last is only covered by a thin Lamina, the Tubercula ' Quadrigemina being either absent or -indistinct, thongh ^ the Pineal Gland is present. In each of the Optic Thalami, there \% an adclkional Ventricle, which opens into the passage leading from the Third to the Fourth Ventricle. 'I he Cerebellum is only a simple Lobe; it has, how- ever, transverse Striae, somewhat similar to those in Mammalia. I he Fourth Ventricle has also, as in that class, a Calamus Scriptorius, and an Arbor Vitas; but the latter is more simple than in Mammiferous Ani- mals. 7 he Pons Varolu is wanting. The Medulla Oblon- gata has no Eminences, such as are seen in the former class of Animals. 0 4 Nerves.

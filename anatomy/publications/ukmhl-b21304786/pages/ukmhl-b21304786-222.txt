The Tkii'd, either by a hole peculiar to it, or by a Sphenoid Fissure, passes to the Muscles, as in Mammalia, 'Fhe Fourth is also as in the former class. The Fifth divides as in Mammalia. The Branches to the Beak correspond with those about the Jaws in Mam- miferous Animals; but those to the inner side of the Nose are of great magnitude, and run to the extremity of the Bill, in Birds which search for their food in water, mud, &c.

'1 he Eighth and Ninth pairs are dis- persed as in Mammalia. The Great Sympathetic has origins, connexions, and terminations, which bear a considerable analogy to those of the Animals of the former class, varying only in some particulars. It passes through the same Foramen with the Pars Vaga and Glosso-pharyngeus. It unites with Nerves near it, has Ganglia in its course through the Body, and can be traced as far as the Vertebrte of the Tail. The Spinal Marroza is nearly of the same nature, and the

[Part I. 100 OF THE EAR forward in such as pursue, as the Lion, &c. Or in some, the superior part of the Concha is turned down, as in the Spaniel, Sheep, Hog, Elephant, &c. which en- ables tliem to hear sounds from below. Pendant Ears are considered by some Naturalists as marks of slavery. In the Bat, the Concha is so constructed, as to pre- vent the Air from rushing violently in while the Animal is flying. The External Ear, in Quadrupeds, is more conical, and more uniform internally, than in Man. In all the class, excepting some of the Ape tribe, the outer bar of the Ear, or Helix, is wanting, the part being thin, and sharp on the edges; and instead of an Antihelix, there is a transverse eminence, situated deep in the Ear. There is a Tragus and Antitragus, the latter of which, in some Animals, as the Shrew, serves as an Operculum to the Ear. In Animals with very long and moveable Ears, the Muscles are much more numerous than in Man. In the Dog, Horse, Sheep, &c. they are from a dozen to twenty" in number to each Ear. Some arise from the Head, and are fixed to the part at the root of the Concha of the Ear, tenned Scutum; others come likewise from the Head, and are inserted into the Concha or Meatus Externus; some pass from the Scutum to the Concha, and some from one part of the Concha to another.. By means of these Muscles, the Animal can comrilonly move the Ear in every direction, or turn it upon its own axis, witlxout moving the Head. All Adult Quadrupeds have the Meatus Externus osseous at its inner part; but it varies in length, width, and direction, in different Species. In some, it is cy- lindrical ;

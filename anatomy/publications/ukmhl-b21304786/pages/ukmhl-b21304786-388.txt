[Part IX. OF ZOOPHYTES. 138a The different Organs of the Senses are not demon- strable here, though, as in the Vermes, Zoophytes are to be considered as possessing Senses adapted to their maimer of living. Vascular System.â€”Tn the Echinus^ two Vessels run along the Intestines, one considered as an Aorta, the other a V ena Cava, but without any visible Heart. From these a Plexus runs off, to be distributed upon the Intestines and Mesentery. Something of the same kind is to be observed in the Asterlas. In the Echinus, there is a set of Tubes, considered by Dr Monro as Absorbents, which have a visible Muscidar structure, and without Valves. The outer end of each of the Tubes has a flat plate, by which the Ani- mal adheres when it fixes upon any object. In the middle of the plate is an orifice, which imbibes the sea-water, that is conducted to Vessels in the inner part . of the Shell, Each of the Ducts perforates the Shell by two Foramina; and tfie different Foramina are pla- ced in five pairs of parallel lines, called by Naturalists Ambulacra, from their similarity to alleys in a garden. Upon the inner side of the Shell, they run to two ranges of Laminae, composed of Plexus of Vessels, from each of which a Duct runs to a large Tube, which receives all the Absorbents of one of the double ranges. The large Tube terminates in Reservoirs over the Sockets of the Teeth, through which it is supposed, that after a se- cretion has been made, tlie fluid absorbed is returned to the sea.

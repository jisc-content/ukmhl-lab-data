OF MAMMALIA. Part I.] 4J3 The Cetacea have also their Os Hyoides ; with its An- terior and Posterior Cornua, which are of considerable length, and of a particular form. TRUNK, The Trunk in Mammalia, as in the Human Body, is divided by Anatomists into Spine, Pelvis, and Tho- rax, the first of which is the most constant part of the Skeleton, The Spine has the same number of Cervical Vertebrae in the different individuals of this class, as in the Human Body, excepting the thrce-toed Sloth, which, instead of seven, has nine. In the Ape tribe, the Cervical Vertebrae differ from those in Man, chiefly in the Spinous Processes being proportionally stronger, and not forked. In the Ferae, the Spinal Holes are almost in the Bodies of the Verte- brae. The first and second Vertebrae in these Animals are remarkable, the former for the strength of its Transverse, the latter for that of its Spinous Pro- cesses ; these parts affording attachment to the powerful IMuscles which correspond with the other parts in ena- bling the Animal to seize its prey, or defend itself. In the Armadillo, and other Animals of this order, the six last Cervical Vertebrae are in a m.anner soldered together, and have a kind of Groove in which the Eso- phagus is lodged. In the Cetacea, the Bodies of the Cervical Vertebrae are remarkably thin, and two or three of them arc frequently anchylosed. The 'Dorsal Vertebras in true Quadrupeds have the anterior

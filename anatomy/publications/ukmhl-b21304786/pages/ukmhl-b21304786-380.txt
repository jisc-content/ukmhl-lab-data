OF WORMS. 374 [Part VIII. The the Larva? of Insects. A Ganglion representing the Brain is situated on tlie Head, and forms a Collar round the Esophagus, sending Nerves to the rest of the Body. In the Leech.) the Nervous System is a slender Cord, com- posed of numerous Ganglia. The first sends a Collar round the I]sopliagus ; the others send Nerves to the ditferent parts of the Body. The Earth-worm has also a Ganglion or little Brain about the Esophagus, but no others in the rest of the Body. The Lwmbrims Huma- nus has the appearance of a Collar about the Esophagus, a Cord along each side of the Body, and several Ganglia. Neither Eyes, Ears, nor Nose, have been discovered in Worms, yet they can select the nourishment proper for them. Circtdating Stjstcm.â€”Circulating Vessels are percep- tible here, with distinct contraction and dilatation, but without any Heart, in some of the Animals of this class; in others, they arc wanting or invisible. The Blood, in several Worms, is more or less of a reddish colour, and in some is as deep as in the higher classes of Ani- mals. A great Vessel, in many, runs along the Bach, and diminishes towards the Extremities. The Leech has a principal Vessel on each side, which communicates with the opposite one by many transverse Branches ; forming a Plexus on the Back, and another on the Belly. These are supposed by Naturalists to serve for Respiration, there being no other evident Organ for this purpose. There is also a \'essel running along the Back, which appears to be an Artery. It gives Branches to the two sides, but whether the two sets of Vessels communicate, is not fully^ascertained.

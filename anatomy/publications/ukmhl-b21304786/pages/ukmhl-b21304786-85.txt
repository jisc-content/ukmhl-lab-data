Fart I.] OF MAMMALIA. 79 as tlte Sheeps they are flat, and they form different cur- vatures according to the kind. Between the Process of Bone and the Horn covering it, a soft Vascular Sub- stance is interposed, which, while it nourishes the out- side of the Bone, produces the Horn in successive Layers, sent off upon the internal surface. As the Ani- mal advances in life, F urrows extend across the root of the Horn, frcan which', by experience, the age of the Animal can nearly be known. The Horn of the Rhi- noceros only differs from that of Ruminants^ in being situated over the Bones of the Nose, in appearing to take its origin from the Skin, and in having no Osseous matter w'ithin. The colour of the Horns, as of the Hair, depends upon that of the Corpus Mucosum. In their consist- ence they are solid, insensible, and of a Fibrous tex- ture ; the Fibres bearing a considerable analogy to the Hairs, as may be more distinctly seen in the Horn of the Rhinoceros. They are more or less transparent ac- cording to their thinness. When artificially softened by hot water, &c. they may be bent in any direction, and moulded into any form. The Antler of the Stag differs from Horn, in grow- ing from its extremity, and not from its base; in being covered, at g, certain period, with Hairs; and^ in being deciduous. It is a real Process of Bone, appearing, when fully grown, a continuation of the Os Frontis, and is covered, during the time of its growth, with a Periosteum and a hairy Skin, which is very Vascular ; the Vessels passing through an Osseous circle at the root

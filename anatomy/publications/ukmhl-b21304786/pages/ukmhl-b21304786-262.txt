PART III. OF REPTILES. OF THE BONES. The general structure of the Skeleton of Reptiles va- ries much in the different orders of the class. The Cranium^ for the most part, is large in proportion to the size of the Brain, though small when compared with the bulk of the Head. In the Turtle^ the apparent magnitude of the Head is owing to the Accessory Bones, between which and the Cranium there is a large space occupied by Muscles and Glands, and by the Organs of Vision. The Cranium’ is joined to the Vertebrae of the Neck by a single Occi- pital Condyle. The Loiver Jaw is composed of five pieces, one in the middle, and two at each side; and is articulated somewhat after the manner of the articulation in Birds. It has no Condyle^ but a hollow articular sui'face, which is joined to an eminence of the Temporal Bone; a structure the reverse of that in Mammalia. In all other Reptiles, there is nearly the same kind of articulation as in the Turtle. There are no 7'ectli in the Turtle kind, in place of which their Jaws are co- vered

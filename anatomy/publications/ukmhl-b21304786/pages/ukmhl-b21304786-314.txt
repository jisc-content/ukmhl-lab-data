308 OF THE BRAIN, kc. [Part IV. riiere is no Diaj)hragniatic Nei ve, though one of the first Vertebral Nerves is spent upon the partition between the Cavity of the Branchiee and that of tlie Abdomen. The Dorsal and Lumbar Nerves arc all distributed in the Intercostal spaces. The Sacral and Caudal Nerves are not very distinct; they are lost in the posterior part of the Body and the Tail Fin. â€¢/ Besides the Nerves mentioned above, it is here thought proper to take notice of those which belong, in certain Filectrical Fishes, to that curious apparatus which performs the office of a Leyden Jar, or Electrical Battery. Tlicj^nya Torpedo, Gfjmnotns Elcctria^s, and Silurus Electricus, are the only Fishes in which Electri- cal Organs have been discovered ; though one Species of the Tetraodon, and one of the Trichmrus, possess the same electric property. In the three first-named Ani- mals, the Electi-ic Organ consists of Aponeurotic Cells, filled with a fluid like the Glaire of an Egg. Upon this substance large Nerves arc distributed ; but the firoportional size and the structure of the Cells, the ori- gin, number, and relative' magnitude of the Nerves, vary in the three different Species. The Electrical Organ of the Torpedo bears a large proportion to the Body of the Animal, and is situated between the Head, the Branchia?, and ffreat Cartilairc of the Pectoral Fin in each side; or in that part from whence the Mucous Ducts issue as from a centre, on the Back of the STicitc. It extends in a perpendicular direction from the Dorsal to the Abdominal Skin. When the Integuments arc raised, the Organ appears, consisting

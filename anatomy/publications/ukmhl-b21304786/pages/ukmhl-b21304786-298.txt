OF THE MAl.E OJlOxVNS [Taut 111. the Kpitlidyiuis is a lai’ge Canal, wliich forms the \'as Deferens, that runs in a flexuous manner to open in the Cloaca at the base of the Penis. In Lizards, the Epi- didymis is detached iVom the Testicle, and Ibrms a py- ramidal Body longer than it. From this the Vas Defe- rens goes along the edge of the Testicle, in a waving direction, to the C’loaca. In Frogs, the Vas Deferens terminates in a Papilla. The V esiculae Seminalc.s, and Prostate Gland, are not found in Ueptiles in general. The Frog', however, has two large Ve.siculaj Seminales. In the Turtle kind, there is but one Penis. In most Lizards and Serpents, there are two. In the Frog kind, the Penis is entirely wanting. In the Turtle, very large, and in the relaxed state, is retracted within the Cloaca. It is composed of two Corpora Cavernosa, and has a Groove in its upper surface, instead of an Urethra, the margins of which come so close together when the }>art is distended, as to form a complete Canal. The Penis has two Retractor jMuscIes, w'hich run I’rom the Pelvis to the under side of the Gians. ’ In Lizards and Scipents, the Penises are short and cylindrical, and commonly surrounded wdth bristles. In the I'claxed state, they commonly lie in a Pouch under the Skin of the 'Pail. They are erected by the ))ower of the Muscles of the Tail, and appear at the sides of the Cloaca. Two Retractors from the first Vertebra of the Tall return them to their natural situa- tion in the IVntch. 'Phe Rattlesnake and P/^jc;'have also double Penises; eacii of which is bifid, and beset with bristles. In

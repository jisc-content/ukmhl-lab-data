S65 Part VIL] OF INSECTS. The Cornea of compound Eyes is lined witli an opaque Mucus, varying in colour in different Insects. Behind this white spots appear, equal to the number of the Facets of the Cornea. On the back part of this a Choroides is found, which appears to receive a real Re- tina ; but further investigation is necessary to shew how the rays of light can reach the bottom of the Eye, so as to enable the Animal to form distinct vision. Ii} the greater number of Insects, the Eyes appear to be des- titute of motion. Ear.â€”The Organ of Heai'ing has not been found in any of the individuals of this class, though it is not to be doubted that they enjoy the Sense of Hearing, since, in the Males, means are provided for calling the Females to them, which are heard by the latter, as is observed in the Crickets^ Grasshoppers, Death-xeatch, &c. Nei- ther is there any ap[:>earance of an Organ of Smell, though they give proofs of the existence of this Sense. They discover their Food seemingly by its smell, some- times even at a considerable distance; and some, as the Flcsh-JIy, frefjuently deposite their Ova on Plants, as the Arum Dreicuntium and Stapclia Hirsuta, which have the smell of Carrion ; though, in such cases, the -Mag- gots commonly perish through want. The |iart which has been considered, by some late Authors, as supply^ ing the place of the Organ of Smell, is the Stigma, or entry into the Trachea; by others, the Antennae have been looked upon as answering this purpose. When Insects are deprived of their Antennae, it has been ob- served that they are incapable of recognizing theif 4 haunts, or their Food, though placed close by them. Or (ran

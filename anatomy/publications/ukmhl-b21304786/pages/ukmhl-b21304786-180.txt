[Faut I. m OF THE KIDNEV linct, but they have not always tlie same proportional tlhckncss; In some, the Cortical being three or four times thicker than the Medullary part. The Medullary Sub.stance does not constantly terminate in Papillge. In the Dog', Cat, some of the Opossums, &c. the part which transmits the Urine forms a Cavity, the surface of which, however, is pale, like that of the Fapillse. In many Animals, as the Squirrel, Hare, &c. there is but one Papilla; in some of the Rat kind, two; in the deeply-divided Kidneys, commonly but one in the Lobe ; but in the Bear, each Lobe is found to have two Papilla?. The number of Infundibula corresponds with that of the Papilla?; when these are absent, the Pelvis is joined to the edges of the surface which sends out the Urine, and then, as happens in the Cat, it does not appear beyond the Kidney. In the Bear, and other Animals with Conglomerated Kidneys, the Infundibula unite in succession, and go to the Ureter without forming a Pelvis. The Ureters agree, in Mammalia in general, in their course, size, proportional length, structure, and termination. In the Lobulated Kidneys, the Arteries do not all go into the Sinus of the Kidney, many of them taking a more direct course t .vards the Lobes to which they are destined * Renal Glands. 1 he Ren*al Gland is generally situated at the Inner â€¢ part

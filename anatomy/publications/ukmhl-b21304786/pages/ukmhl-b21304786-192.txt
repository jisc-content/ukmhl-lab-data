18G UrvINARY AND MALE ORGANS [Part L in every Genus. In some, as the Ape tribe and UorsCy it is dilated somewhat, as in the Human Species. In otliers, as tlie Ro«r, and many Ruminants^ it is conical and pointed, and in some turned to one side. Many others, as tlie Carnivora^ have it also conical, but with the addition of the Os PeniSy which commonly projects to the extremity of the Gians. In the Elephanty it is cylindrical like the Penis, and then contracts at the ex- tremity. In many, the Gians has a Tendinous appearance. In some, it is covered with hairs; in others, with scales; and some of the Cat tribe have retroverted Spinous Processes, which may assist in enabling the Male to cling’ to the Female till the Semen is evacuated. In the Badi^er, Boff, &c. or such as have the copula- tion tedious, there is a double Gians, or two Cavernous Prominences, one in the Body of the Penis, the other near its extremity. Behind the Prominences are two Veins, which are compressed by Muscles in the time of coition; in consequence of tvhich, the return of the Blood is prevented, and the double Gians kept in a state qf distension. Something of a similar nature is produced at this time in the Female ; the Vagina and its Corpus Cavernosum are contracted, by which the Animals are lield together, and often, contrary to their inclination, till the Semen is evacuated, and the parts relaxed. In the Opossums, tlie Gians is divided into two parts, each ol which is perforated for the transmission of the Semen. At the division of the Gians, is the passage for the Urine.

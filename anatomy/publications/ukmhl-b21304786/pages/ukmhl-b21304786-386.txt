OF ZOOPHYTES. [Part IX. G80 The The Ilolotliuria is covered with a thick Coriaceous Skin, whicli, by means of longitudinal and circular bands of IVIuscular Fibres, the Animal can shorten or lengthen at pleasure. Some of the Animals of this Genus have numerous Feet, which are either spread over, or situated upon, the side of the Body. In some, the Feet are entirely wanting. The other orders of Zoophytes have a contractile power residing in their substance, somewhat similar to that of the Mollusca Nuda. The Medusa, by alternate- ly rendering its Body convex or flat, can so displace the water as to fit it for swimming; but Muscular Fibres cannot be discovered liere, probably on account of their transparency. The Actinia has such a contractile power in its Skiij, as to assume a variety of forms. It can turn itself into a plain surface, or become cylindrical <w conical, &c. at pleasure. In the Hydra, or common Polypus, only some move- able Tentacula are found. Tlie small Animals termed VortkeUa and Rotjfera, are observed, by the assistance of glasses, to have Cilia of different forms, moving round their axis with great rapidity. ' In the Mouth of the Echinus ate five Teeth of great size, which surround the entry to the Esophagus, and have Muscles for enabling tliem to masticate their Food. The Star-Jish has no Teeth, but a round Mouth, which leads, by a short Esophagus, to the Stomach. The Spines round the Mouth, though not proper Teeth, are observed to lay hold of the prey.

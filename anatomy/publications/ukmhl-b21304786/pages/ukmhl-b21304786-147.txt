141 Part I.] OF MAMMALIA. OF THE LARYNX, The Larynx agrees, in its general structure, with that in Man. It differs chiefly according to the form of the Cartilages, the size and form of the Ventricles, and of certain Sacs connected with these in particular Animals. Most of the class have a Muscle peculiar to the Epi- glottis, and termed Hyo-Epiglottideus. It is commonly cylindrical; arises by two portions from the Base of the Anterior Cornua of the Os Hyoides, and is inserted into the middle of the Epiglottis, which it serves to raise from the Glottis. The Epiglottis exists in Mammalia in general, with very few exceptions. It is so small in the Bat tribe, as to be scarcely observable. It appears to be deficient, or very small, also, in some of the Mouse-like Animals, as the Glis Esculentis, or Rel-Mouse. In the Ape tribe the Larynx differs little from that in Man, excepting that the Ventricles are a little larger. In the Ourang-outang the Ventricles of the Larynx are very large, and each divided into two by a semi- partition ; above which is a Foramen, leading to a large discovered by Db Camper.

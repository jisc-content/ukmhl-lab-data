OF MAMMALIA. Part I.] 83 smell is remarkably strong; and some of the JFease/ tribe in America, as the Skunk and Squas?if are ob- served, upon being pursued, to pour out the contents of these Bags so profusely, that their followers cannot approach them. The matter secreted in these Bags may he excvemea- titious in some Animals; hut in others, it appears to lubricate the Skin, and defend it from being injured by the Foeces. The Badger, Opossum, and other Marsicplal Animals, have Pouches on the Abdomen, lined with fine Hair, and discharg-irrsT from their surface secretions of a Seha- ceous nature, which, when recent, have a disagreeable odour, hut are found, after being dried, like the Scent Bags in many other Animals, to acquire an agreeable musky smell. Over the Sacrum of the Aper Moserfer, or Mexican Hog, there is a Gland termed Dorsal, some inches in length, and lobulated, from which a Duct opens on the Skin, and pours out a liqdor which also has a musky smell. In the Feet of several Ruminants, especially in Sheep, are Glandular Cavities, lined with Hair, and sending out an Excretory Duct, which opens at the junction of the Hooves. 1.^ cl X. ^ OF %

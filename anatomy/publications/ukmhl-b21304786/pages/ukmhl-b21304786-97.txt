Paih' I.] OF IMAMMALIA. 01 Spinal Marrow and Vertebral Nerves. The Spinal IMarrow is covered by the same Mem- branes, and divided into two Lateral Cords in the same manner, as in the Human Body. The division into two Lateral Portions is still more distinctly marked than in Man. The number of the Nerves coming off from the Spinal arrow is equal to that of the holes between the Vertebraâ€™; and tliey arise in a similar manner as in the Human Subject. The Cervical Nerves are seven in number on each side in Mammalia in general, besides the Occipital and Accessory Nerves. The size and extent of the Branches of these Nerves vary according to the nature of the parts which they supply. The Brachial Plexus is produced by the three last Nerves of the Neck, and lirst of the Back. They consist, as in INIan, of a num- ber of large Trunks, variously disposed, according to the shape and size of the anterior extremity. The Dia- ])hragmatic Nerve is quite similar to that in Man. The Dorsal and Lumbar differ only in number from those in the Human Body, and they may be known by attending to the number of the Vertebrae. Of the Pelvic and Caudal Nerves, the former is as in Man, the latter go from the Vertebral Canal, by the Foramina between the first pieces of the Caudal Verte- brae, to be dispersed upon parts at the root of the Tail, and upon the continuation of that substance. The Nerves of the Posterior or Abdominal Extremi- ties form a Plexus, of which the Cords, and their dis- tribution, are nearly as in the Human Species. or

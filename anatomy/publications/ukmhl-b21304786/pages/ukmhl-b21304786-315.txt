Part IV.] OF FISHES. 309 consisting of some hundred pentagonal or hexagonal co- lumns, closely compacted, and giving somewhat the appearance of a Honeycomb. The Columns are form- ed of transparent Laminje, and are connected together by transverse Tendinous Fibres. They are divided by a great number of thin partitions placed over each other, but leaving small spaces between them, which are full of a glairy liquor. Minute Blood-vessels arc dispersed upon this Organ. Its Nerves are of extra- ordinary size, and are furnished by four principal Branches. The first is the Inferior Maxillary, or third portion of the Fifth Pair, and corresponds with that which, in the Back of the Skate, sends a very large Nerve to the origin Â©f the Mucous Ducts. The other Nerves are from the Eighth Pair, and come to the E- lectrical Organ after suppling the Gills. I he whole of this remarkable substance is found to correspond in its effects with those of an Electrical Ma- chine. '1 he upper and under surfaces of the Animal are in the plus and minus states of Electricity, and the shock is given at the will of the Creature; but differs from that coming from an Electrical Apparatus, in pro- ducing neither light nor sound. The Electrical Organ, in the Gijmnotus, is more de- veloj:)ed than that of the Torpedo. It composes a great part of the thickness of the very large Tail, and ex- tends from within a little distance of the Head to the posterior extremity of the Animal. It is divided into four portions, called by IMr Hunter, Great and Small Organs. The Great Organs are placed above the Small TJ 3 at

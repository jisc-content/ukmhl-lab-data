194 OF THE FEMALE ORGANS [Part I. Tlie number and form of these excrescences vary in different Animals. In tlie Sheep and Cow^ they are from seventy to a hundred. In some Animals, they are concave externally ; in others, c.onvex. The Involucra of the Foetus consist of the outer Membrane, or Chorion, and the inner one, or Amnios, that secretes the liquor in which the Animal swims. The two Membranes, contrary to what happens in the Human Species, are covered with Blood-vessels derived from those of the Umbilical Cord. - Between the Chorion and Amnios, in most pregnant Mammalia, the Getace<^ not excepted, there is an Al- lantois, or Bag, but destitute of Blood-vessels, which receives the Urine from the Bladder by a Canal termed Urachus. In Soli^icds, the Allantois is every where interposed between the other two Membranes. In the Cow and Sheep, it covers only part of the Amnios ; and in the Soxc, it covers only a small part of that Membrane. In the Mare and Sow, there is a fleshy-like mass con- tained in the Allantois, which has been considered bv some as the sediment of the Urine, and termed Hippo- manes, or Horse-venom, the nature of which is imper- fectly understood. The Allantois is wanting in the Ape kind, and in the Hedge-hog, Dog, Cat, &c. in which is found a Mem- brane, termed Tunica Erythroides, which contains a watery fluid at the commencement of pregnancy, and is connected to the Mesenteric Vessels of the Foetus, but has no Urachus. Like the Vesicula Umbilicalis in the Human Foetus, this is more immediately connected with early pregnancy. ' Th^

The Right Aorta furnishes the Aorta Anterior, that soon divides into two Branches, of which, one is the common Carotid, the other is the Subclavian. The Carotids are dispersed like those in Mammalia. The Subclavians are also nearly as in Man. Lizards.—In the Crocodile, there are three principal Arteries, each with two Semilunar Valves. 1. 'Ihe Pulmonary Artery on the left side. 2. The Aorta Pos- terior Sinistra. 3. The Aorta Posterior Dextra. 'I he three Arteries are joined together for some space, as in the former order. Serpents.—The Lung being single here, and the Ex- tremities Avanting, renders the Blood-vessels more simple than in the former orders. Frog and Salamander.—The Aorta soon divides into two Branches; each of these produces a Pulmonary, a Carotid, and Subclavian, and Arteries similar to the Intercostals, then turns back, and unites with its fellow. The Trunk resulting furnishes the Coeliac and other Arteries, which generally come off from the Abdominal Aorta. i Veixs. The Turtle tribe have two Posterior Cavae, which, after passing the anterior part of the Liver, are each joined by an Anterior Cava of the same side, formed bv the common Trunk of the Jugular and Subclavian.

PART V. OF M O L L U S C.A. The Mollusca, like other Invertebral Animals, are destitute of a real Skeleton; but many have dis- tinct Jaws, which are fixed in the Flesh, there being no Head for articulation. In the Cuttle-Fish^ there are two horny Jaws, like the Bill of a Parrot^ situated in the centre of the fore part of the Body, and serving for the trituration of the Shell-fish which the Animal devours. Surrounding the Jaws are the Tentacula, or Large Arms, which, by means of numerous cups placed upon them, enable the Animal to fix itself to surround- ing objects. Some of the individuals of this class, as the Snail, have but one Upper Jaw; others have two Lateral Jaws. The Tritonia has two Jaws, which act like the blades of Scissars; but many have none. In some, as the Whelk, &c. a Proboscis supplies the place of Jaws. In the back of the Cuttle-Fish, there is a kinil of Bone composed of Lamellae. In other Spe- cies, its appearance is difterent; but it is generally elas- tic and transparent. The Sepia Octopus wants it. The Epidermis, in this class of Animals, varies in thickness in different individuals. In Testaceous Mol- Y 3 lusca,

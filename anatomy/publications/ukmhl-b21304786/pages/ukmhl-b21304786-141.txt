OF MAMMALIA. 135 Fart I.] in the Human Body, chiefly in the size and distribution of its Branches, corresponding with the division and ex- tent of the Intestines, and the magnitude .of the other Abdominal Viscera. Of the peculiarities of the Arteries here, the most re- markable is that of the Rete Mirabile, found in the greater number of Quadrupeds, particularly among Carnivorous Animals and Ruminants. It is situated at the sides of the Sella Turcica, and consists of a division of the Internal Carotids within the Head into serpentine Branches, which afterwards uniting, form a Trunk, tliat divides again nearly as in the Human Body. An uncommon division of the Arteries, also, has lately been observed in some Animals, as the Sloth and Lemur^ where the Trunks separate at the top of the Os Humeri and Os Femoris into Branches, which, after descending nearly as far as the Elbow and Knee, re- unite, and are then distributed in the usual way. In some Animals, as the Cetacea, a considerable Plexus of convolutions is found in Arteries of particu- lar parts of the Body, as the Intercostals, Branches from the Subclavians to tlje Chest, and Branches to the . Spinal Marrow and Eye. In many Animals, the common lilacs are wanting^ and there the Aorta divides into two Branches, which supply the place of External Iliacs, while a common Trunk, from the extremity of the Aorta, sends off* the Sacra Media and Arteries analogous to the Internal Iliacs. The Sacra Media, in Quadrupeds, is generally of con- I 4 siderable

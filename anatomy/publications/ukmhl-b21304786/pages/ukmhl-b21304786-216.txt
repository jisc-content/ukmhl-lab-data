OF THE MUSCLES [Part If. Digitoi-um. The Extensor Longus Pollicis is 'want- ing ; four small Muscles supply the place of the Extensor Brevis; a Flexor Brevis Pollicis is situat- ed in the back part of the Tarsus. 'I here are long Flexors of the Toes, which are divided into three masses; these come partly from the Os Femoris, and partly from the Bones of the Leg. They have connect- ed to them an Accessory Flexor, Avhich comes from the Pubes,, and sends a Tendon over the Knee. 'J he diffe- rent 'J'endons run under the Heel, and are united by Fibres to each otiicr ; and one set of 'Jâ€™endons perforate another, and are fixed to the different Phalanges of the Toes. By this mechanism, the Bird is supported, or. can lay hold of Branches of Trees, &e. when roosting; the weight of the Body giving that degree of flexion to the Knee and Heel, which produces the necessary con- traction of the 'J'oes. By this contrivance, also, Ra- pacious Birds, seize their prey while pouncing on it. When they wish to disengage themselves, they do it readily by raising the Body, after which the Toes arr expanded.

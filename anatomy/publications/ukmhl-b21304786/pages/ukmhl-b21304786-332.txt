There are, in most Fishes, four Gills in each side, resting on an equal number of arched portions of Car- tilage or Bone, connected to the Os Hyoides; and these are fixed to the Head, or to the first ^'ertebra?. / Each of the Gills consists of two ranges of Cartila- ginous Laminae, and are joined together for two-thirds of their inner edge. I'he Laminae issue like rays, and have the Branches of the Pulmonary Artery minutely dispersed upon them. In many Cartilaginous Fishes, as the Raja, Squalus, &c. there are five Gills on each side. In the Lavi'prey there are seven. In a small Animal, the Hippocampus, eight.. In the first set of Cartilaginous Fishes, as the Slade, 8cc. there are, on the inferior siu face of the Ani- mai, Holes equal to the number of the Gills, and on the Dorsal side, an opening behind each Eve ; but in the other kinds, there is only a single opening exter- nal! v

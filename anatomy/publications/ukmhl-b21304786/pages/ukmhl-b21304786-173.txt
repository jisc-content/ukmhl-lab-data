1G7 OF MAMMALIA. Part I.] The L 4 more distinctly separated from each other, than in Man., In the Ferae, in particular, as the Dog, Cat, Lion, t<:c. the Fissures are very deej), and run through the whole mass. The Lobes divided in this manner, have been considered by some Authors, as allowing the parts to slide on each other, in Animals witli very flexible Spines ; while others are of a different opinion. In the orders Solipeda, Pecora, Bclluae, and Cetacea, the Lobes are less numerous than in Man. The Hog has four, but the Horse, Ruminants, Ele- phant, and Cetacea, have only two, and these not more separated than in the Human Subject. In the Horse, Ox, &c. with rigid Spines, the Liver is in one piece, and has no Ligamentum Latum, being sufficiently sup- ported by the Muscles of the Abdomen. Gall-Bladder. — The Gall-bladder exists in all the Ape tribe ; in the Bradypoda, excepting the Sloths ; in most of tlie Ferae, as the Weasels, the Dogand Cat kind ; and in most Ruminants ; but it is wanting in many of the Glires, particularly in several ol‘ the Rat tribe ; in Soli- peds ; in the Camel, Goat, and Deer, among the Rumi- nants ; in the FJephant and Rhinoceros among the Bel- lucc; and in the Trichccus, Porpoise, and Dolphin, a- rnong the Cetacea. All the Mammalia that want a Gall-bladder are vege- table eaters, excepting the Porpoi.'ie and Dolphin. Its situation is constantly under the right Lobe of the Liver, when tliere are two, and under the middle Lobe, when there are more than two, It has com- monly a Pyriform ajipearance, as in the Iluman Body; but in many it is round or cylindrical.

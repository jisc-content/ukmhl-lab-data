OF REPTILES. 28T Part IIL] The The Anus, in some, as the Tortoise, is placed undev the Tail. In others, as the and Toad, which have no Tail, it is above the extremity of the Back. There are some varieties in the situation and attach- ments of the Mesentery. In the Tortoise, it is conti- nued from the Mesocolon, and is not connected directly to the Vertebra?. In Lizards, the Mesentery and Mesocolon come off from the Vertebras. Serpents have no Mesocolon Transversum. Reptiles in general may be said to want the Omen- tum, yet many Lizards have a substance resembling it, charged with Fat; and the Fatty Lobes, attached to the Testicles and Ovaria of Fi'ogs, are considered by some as a kind of Omentum, while others think them connected with the parts of Generation, on account of the great increase of bulk at pairing-time. — migamrn — OF TLIE LIVER, PANCREAS, AND SPLEEN The Liver is present in the whol e class, and is pro- portionally larger than in Mammalia or Birds, extend- ing generally to both Hypochondriac regions. It is still less divided than in Birds. In some, it has two Lobes ; but in many, it has none. It is connected to the Body by the Peritoneum, as in Mammalia. The colour is commonly bordering upon yellow.

ORGANS OF VOICE, Sec. [Part III. -84 OF formed of Polygonal Cells, containing still smaller Cells. Posteriorly, they aj)pcar to terminate in a simple bag. Serpents have, b)r the most part, a single Lung, and here the Trachea terminates direclly into it, without dividino; into Bronchi. In the young of some Reptiles, as the Tadpole, which are j)roduccd in the water, and metamorphose in their first state, in f)lace of Lungs, there arc two Bodies, the Appendices dinihriafev, like Branchiae or Gills, hanging loose by the sides of the Neck.-'! hese are gradually taken into the '1 horax, in which they afterwards disappear. The Siren Laecrtina, and the Proteus Anguinus, are supposed to possess both during life. In Reptiles, part of the Blood only goes to the I.lings, the re.st of the mass going to the other }iarts of the Body, a circumstance different from what happens in the two former classes. The Pulmonary Blood-vessels ramify on the Lungs, and serve also as Bronchial A essels, which are not found here. In Reptiles in general, where the Ribs are either confounded with the other parts of the Thorax, or are so deficient as to be unable to contribute to Respiration,, this process is observed to be effected by the Animal shutting life mouth, dilating the Throat, and produc- ing a void, in consequence of which, the air enters by the Nostrils. The Throat is next contracted, so that it forces the air into the Lungs. Expiration is owing to the action of the iMuscles of the Belly. In opening the Thorax of the Turtle or Frog, the Lungs remain distended for some time, owing to the parts about the Throat acting as a Valve-

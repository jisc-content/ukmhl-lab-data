G6 OF THE MUSCLES [Pakt I. nected with the Pectoralis Major, as to go partly to the Humerus. The Subclavius, In the Ape tribe, is as in Man; in Mammalia without Clavicles, it is wanting. The Serratus Magnus is more extensive in the Infe- rior Mammalia than in Man, being attached not only to the Ribs, but to the Transverse Processes of the Cervical Vertebrae. Aliiseles situated bctzocen the Ribs, and within the Tho- rax.—The Intercostal and Sterno-costal Muscles are nearly as in Man, only the latter Muscle is generally larger, and may therefore act more powerfully upon the Ribs. Muscles situated on the Inferior part of the Vertebras of the Neck.—The Muscles on the inferior part of the V'^ertebrae of the Neck are not materially different from the corresponding Muscles of the Human Body, but generally have their Fleshy Bellies proportionally larger and more distinct. Muscles (f the Spine and Superior Parts of the Tr unk in general.—In A2KS, the Muscles of the Spine differ only in the strength of their Tendons. In the other Mammalia, they differ in the number of their attach- ments, which depends upon that of the Vertebrae. The motions of the Os Coccygis are much more visible in the rest of Mammalia than in Man. The Tail, which is merely an elongation of it, can In general move readily in every direction ; may even be turned upon its own axis, or rolled spirally. The Muscles of the Os Coccygis in Animals with prehensile Tails are remarkably numerous, to assist them

245 Part II.] OF BIRDS. from the Peritoneum, The colour is a reddish brown, but the tint varying in different Species. The Gall-bladder is placed between the two Lobes of the Liver, and is sometimes closely attached, at other times is loose and pendulous. It is in some oval; in others, of a spherical figure, and, as in the former class of Animals, has its Fundulus placed undermost. In many Species of Birds, the Gall-bladder is want- ing, as in the Pigeon, Parrot, and Ostrich. The Hepatic Duct, in Birds in general, opens sepa- rately from the Cystic, into the Duodenum. There is no communication between the two Ducts; of course, the Bile found in the Gall-bladder does not get there by regurgitation, as it commonly doeskin Mammalia, but du'ectly from the Biliary Vessels in the Liver by means of Hepato-cystic Ducts, which open either into the Fundus or the Cervix of the Gall-bladder. '1 hese, besides supplying it with Bile, assist in connecting it to the Liver. In some Birds, as the Duck, the Hepatic and Cystic Canals unite into a common Tube; and in the Parro~ quet, there are two Hepatic Ducts which open sepa- rately into the Duodenum. Spleex, There is generally one Spleen only, and this varies much in form, being round, oval, reniform, &c. in dif- ferent Birds. It is situated between the Left Lobe of the Liver and the Stomach, and is fixed in its place by Q 3 plies

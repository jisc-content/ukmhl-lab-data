Â«08 OF THE MUSCLES [Part II. the other from the Humerus. 'Jhere is also an Anconeus. The Supinator Longus is wanting. 'I here is a kind of Supinator Brevis, but it is considered as bending the Fort'-arm. I'wo Muscles occupy the place of the Pro- nator Teres, tliough seemingly acting as Flexors. Tlie Metacarpus possesses only the motions of adduc- tion and abduction. The Muscles for performing these motions are the following: The Ulnaris Internus, which arises as in Man, and is fixed to the wedge-like Bone of the Car[)us; another Muscle lying under this, and sending off a long Tendon, which gives slips to the se- condary Quills, and is Inserted to the back of the Me- tacarpus ; the Ulnaris Externus, which is placed on die posterior surface of the Ulna; its Tendon, j:assing between the last Primary Quill, and first Secondary one, and fixed to the inner edge of the base of the Meta- carpus; a Radial Muscle, which arises by different portions from the External Condyle, and one from the Radius, their common Tendon being fixed to the 'J'u- bercle of the Metacarpal Bone of the Thumb. Ihe Digital Muscles, also, can only perform ad- duction and abduction. Of the Adductors or Ex- tensors, there is the Adductor Phalangis Primae, w'hich corresponds with the Flexor Sublimis, arises from the Internal Condyle, and is fixed to the base of the first Bone of the Great Finger. The Ad- ductor Internus Phalangis Secundae, which corresponds with the Flexor Profundus, and goes along the inner side of the Radius, and is inserted into the base of the second Phalanx. The Adductor Pollicis, which cor- responds to the Flexor Pollicis, is situated between

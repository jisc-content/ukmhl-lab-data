s. . Part I.] OF MAMMALIA. I97 In the Marsupial Animals, as the Kangaroo and O- possum, there is a Bag or Pouch, formed by the Com- mon Integuments, and lined thinly with Plair. It is connected with a pair of Bones arising from the Pubis, which have Muscles for raising them, and the Pouch along with them. It is closed by a Sphincter Muscle, and opened by its own relaxation, or by a Muscle which draw's the Poucli towards the Vulva, to receive the young at the time of delivery. Whether the Embryo ever possesses an Umbilical Cord, or a connection with the Uterus similar to that in other Quadrupeds, is not ascertained; nor is the exact time at which the Foetus enters the Pouch been hitherto pointed out: but it is observed, that at an early period of pregnancy, the Foetus, scarcely an inch in length, passes from the Uterus through the Vulva into the False Belly, where it adheres by its Mouth to one of the Nipples, placed there for its nourishment. When the Animal arrives at a certain degree of matu- rity, it goes out of the Pouch, and re-enters it at plea- sure, till it has acquired strength enough to provide for itself. {See Mu Homeâ€™s Paper on this subject in Phil. Trans. 1795.) No False Belly is found in the Male of these Animals. N PART

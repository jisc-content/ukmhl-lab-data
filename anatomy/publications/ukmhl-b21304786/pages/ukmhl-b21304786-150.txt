144 OF THE LARYNX, &c. [Part L I.igaments there is a large passage in each side, some- thing in the form of a Ventricle, leading to a great Sac, most part of which is covered by the I'hyroid and Ary- tenoid Muscles. Behind the Base of the Epiglottis there is also a Foramen, leading to a cavity situated under the anterior edge of the Thyroid Cartilage, but having no communication with the Lateral Sacs, The Jss has the same kind of Falciform Membiâ€™ane with the Horse, and the same number of Pouches or Sacs, but their Mouths are smaller; while the middle Pouch in the Ass is sensibly larger tlian in the Horse, and is the part from which the sound is considered ta come in braying. In the Mule produced from the Male-Ass and the Mare, or between the Stallion and the She-Ass, it ap- pears that the Larynx is more like that of the Mother, though the voice rather resembles that of the Ass. The Anterior Sac in the Mule is larger than in the Ass. Ruminants have a simple Larynx. The Arytenoid Cartilages are curved back, and form more than half of the Glottis. Their inner surfaces touch each other. There are neither Anterior Ligaments nor Ventricles in some of the individuals of this order, as the Ox and Sheep. In some of the Deer kind, a passage is found at the Base of the Epiglottis, which leads to a Sac similar to that of the Ape tribe, and is in them situated between the Epiglottis and Thyroid Cartilage. The Pig has two Bags situated above or before the Ligaments of the Glottis, which occasion the grunting of the Animal. In the Elephant the Epiglottis reaches behind the Posterior

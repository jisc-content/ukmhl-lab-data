[Part IX. ^384- OF ZOOPHYTES. the Canal is sustained by a Mesentery, which fixes it to the walls or covering of the Animal, as in the Echino- dennata, where, in some of these, as the Echinus and IlulotJiuria, it makes turns within the Body, and ends in the Anus; in others, as the Sipunculus, it is a simple Canal; and in the Asterias^ a Sac in the centre of the Animal, from which two Canals extend into each of the Branches. In some of the others, as the Medusa, the Alimentary Canal is not suspended by the Mesentery, but is a com-' mon Cavity in the genei'al mass. The Stomach occupies the part termed Pedicli. From this Cavity Vessels arise, which convey the nou- rishment to the different parts of the Body. In some the Medusce, there is a simple opening; in others, there are Tentacula with open orifices, leading to Ca- nals, that, uniting together, form Trunks which con-Â« vey the Food into the Stomach. This structure has been compared by Cuvier to the roots of trees, in con- sequence of which he forms a new Genus, termed Rhi- zostoma, or Mouth-root. The common Polypus has the most simple form of the Alimentary Canal, the whole Body being only a kind of Stomach, and having a single opening situated at the centre of the Tentacula, the Animal nourishing its spongy substance by imbibition. The Polypi, which, by their union, form the com- pound Animals that produce the different Lythophytes, are observed to have a nutritive system something simi- lar to the common Polypus and the Medusa. They combine the Stomachs of the former with the Vessels of

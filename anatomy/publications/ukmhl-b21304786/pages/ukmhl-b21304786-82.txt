7G OF THE INTEGUMENTS [Part I. vent tlie Animal from coming against extenial objects, even when the Eves, Ears, and Nose are shut, lliis is considered to be partly owing to the Nerves which are so plentifully dispersed between the Integuments of the ings, and is imagined to be something similar to that sensation by which a blind person discerns, by the Hands and Face, his approach to a wall, or to the door of a house, &c. before he touches them, and mere- ly by the shock given to the air. The Cellular Substance in Mammalia is, as in Man, commonly filled with Fat, the consistence of which va- ries according to the Species, and the state of the Body. In Ruminants, it is of a firm consistence, and forms the Tallow. In the Pig, it is thicker and more uni- form, and has the name of Lard. In the Cetacea, where it forms the Blubber, it is still thicker than in the Hog, but is so fluid, that on a cut being made into the Skin, and without any pressure being applied, it runs in the form of Oil. In this last tribe of Animals, it renders the Body specifically lighter, while, at the same time, it prevents the coldness of the Avater from affect- ing the Blood, which is found to be about the heat of the rest of the Animals of this class. The surface of the Skin of Quadrupeds is lubricated, like that of the Human Body, by an unctuous matter, which defends it from the action of the surrounding clement, and which, in the Dog kind, must supply the want of sweat, that excretion, in these Animals, in some measure passing off, or at least its want being supplied, by a free discharge from the Salivary Glands In many, as the Horse, a lubricating liquor is pro- duced.

From the whole of this structure,- such motion is allowed, that Birds have the peculiar power of placing the Bill under the Wing when they rest. The Dorsal Vertebrce have the Spinous Processes tied together by strong Ligaments, and they are often united into a solid mass. The 'I'ransverse Processes send oft* two points, one forwards, the other backwards, which join those of the other Vertebrae, and the parts here are sometimes also anchylosed'; but in Birds that cannot fly, a%s the Ostrich and Cassoioary, the Vertebrae remain moveable. The Lumbar Vertebrae are commonly ossified' toge- ther, and also to the Bones of the Sacrum and Pelvis, so as to give the appearance of a single Bone. The two lateral parts of the Pelvis do not close before, to form a Symphysis Pubis, excepting in the Ostrich. There is generally a Foramen Thyroideum, and the Ischiatic Notch is formed into a complete Foramen. The Caudal V'ertebrae are found in greatest number in Birds which move their 't ail most freely, as the Magpie and Sxmllow. The last Vertebra of the Tail is the largest, and is often ia l()rm of a plough-share, for the attachment of the Quills. In the Peacock^ it is of an oval form, and situated horizontally. The Thorax, in Birds, is commonly remarkably large in proportion. '1 he Bibs have several peculiari- ties in their form and attachments. Their Vertebral Extremity

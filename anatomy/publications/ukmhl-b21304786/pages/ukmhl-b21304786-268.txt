9M or THE MUSCLES [Part HI, merous. Some pass from the under and fore part of the Back Shell to the Vertebrae of the Neck, and otlieTs from one set of Vertebra; to another. One Mu^le is peculiar to this Animal, which arises from die first J>orsal A'ertebra, and is fixed to the sixth and seventh Cervical VertebriE. It begins the extension of the Neck, when the Head is concealed in the Shell. About half a dozen pairs of Muscles lie on the back part of the Neck, chiefly for raising the Head, or pull- ing it laterally. A few Muscles also appear below, par- ticularly one supplying the place of tlve Sterno-mastoi- deus, for bending the Head, and producing a slight ■ele«v’ation of the Shoulder. The Muscles of the Shoulder are only three in num- ber, and are analogous to the Trapezius, Levator Sca- pulae, and Subclavius. The Muscles of the Humerus are more numerous than in other Animals, to give the necessary motions in swimming. They arise from the Bones of the Shoulder, and from the inner side of the Dorsal and Abdominal Shells. The Pectoralis IVIajor is composed of several portions. There are something like two Deltoids. 'J he other jMuscles are analogous to the Latissimus Dorsi, Levator Brachli, Teres Major, and Biceps. 'J he Muscles of the Fore-arm, and remaining part of the Anterior Extremity, are in a great measure A- poneurotic, the Member being in the form of a Fin, as in the Cetacea. 'I his is particularly the case in the Sea Tortoise, where the Aluscles arc Aponeurotic Bands, which strengthen the Articulations. Muscles of' the Posterior Extremity.—There is a Muscle,

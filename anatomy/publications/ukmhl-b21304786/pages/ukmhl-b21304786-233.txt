Some Predaceoiis and Swimming Birds, and most of the Parrot kind, have a soft Tongue, covered with Pa- pillae, and moistened with Mucus, to enable them to select proper Aliment. In the Parroquet, it is fleshy, very thick, and rounded before. Nocturnal Birds of Prey have it also fleshy, with soft Papillae turned back- ward. In the GaUinacea, the Tongue is triangular, pointed, smooth. Cartilaginous, and destitute of Papillae, except- ing at its root; its firmness preventing it from being in- jured by the hard and pointed substances upon which they live. In the DucTc kind, it is fleshy and large, but in .seve- ral of these, it is furnished with ranges of Osseous La- minae ; and almost all the kinds have rigid Hairs upon the sides. , In the Swan, it is covered with stiff Hairs, Osseous Plates, and Fleshy Papillae; and some of these substan- ces are directed backward. In many, as the Toucan, the Tongue is of a Horny consistence, like a piece of Whale-bone; in the Pic, it is forked, or divided into two parts; in the Ostrich, of a semilunar form, and remarkably short; in the Pelican, so short, that its ex- istence has been by many denied. The nature of the Tongue is more remarkable in the Wood-cock and Wood-pecker, than in many other Animals of this class. In the Wood-cock, the Tongue, and akso the Larynx, are placed deep in the Esophagus, and the former can be elevated by Muscles peculiar to it.

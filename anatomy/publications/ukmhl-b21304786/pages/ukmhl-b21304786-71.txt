65 OF MAMMALIA. Part I.] The other Muscles connected with tlie Os Hyoides vary in different Animals, according to the shape of the Bone. Muscles sitiMtcd on the Inferior and Lateral Parts the Abdomen.—The Abdominal Muscles differ from those in Man chiefly in regard to their proportional length. This difference is most remarkable in the Recti of Carnivora, which’ often extend as far as the Anterior Extremity of the Sternum. In such cases the Pyra- midales are frequently wanting. Muscles of the Parts of Generation,—see Articles Parts cf Generation. Muscles situated xvlthin the Cavity of the Abdomen.' —The Fleshy part of the Diaphragm is generally broad- er in proportion, and it has more extensive motion than in Man, not being so firmly united to the Pericardium. The Quadratus Lumborum, Psoas Parvus, Psoas Mag- nus, and Iliacus Internus, are present in most Quadru- peds. They differ only in proportion, which depends upon the number of the Vertebrae of the Loins, and the length of the Os Ilium. Muscles situated upon the Inferior arid Lateral Parts (f the Thorax.—The Pectoralis Major is for the most part proportionally larger than in Man, and is divided into se- veral portions, giving in some measure the apj>earance of as many distinct Muscles. In Carnivora, the insertion of the Muscles extends as far as the under part of the Hu- merus. The Pectoralis Minor in Carnivorous Animals and Ruminants, is wanting ; but in the Horse, its place is supplied by another Muscle, though this is so con- VoL. IV. E> nected

[Part Ii OF THE MOUTH, &c. are the Head. The changes of the Teeth have been most attended to in the Horse. According to the observa- tion of Farriers and otliers, the Milk Incisors appear at the beginning of the third week after birth. The four middle of these, termed the Pincers^ fall in the SOih month, the four following in the 42d, and the four external, or Corner Teeth, in the 54th. Ihe Per- manent Corner Teeth do not grow so soon as the other Incisors; and when they appear, they scarcely project beyond the Jaw. The hollow in the middle of the Incisors, filled with blackish Tartar, is worn off by use between the fourth and eighth year, after wdiich it is entirely effaced. In the Corner Teeth it remains longer, in consequence of which the Animal’s age can generally be knowui with considerable accuracy. After this period, the age is only judged of by the length of the Incisors, which are in a constant state of growth. Of the Molares, the tw'o first in each Jaw appear at the end of the first week, the following at the end of the third, and the small Anterior Molaris between the fifth and sixth w'eek. The first back Molaris appears near the end of the first year, the second near that of the second year. Be“ tween the second and third year, the first Milk Molares fall, the third drops in three years; and it is not till five or six years that the last Molaris appears. The Temporary Molares are distinguished by being longer from before backwards than the permanent set. In Ruminants, there are three !Milk IMolares, which

OF THE INTESTII^ES [Part I' 158 eiice ; and wliere even this is wanting, as in the Sloth, Armadillo, and Hed^e-liog', the large Intestines are dis- tinguished by the want of Villi, by the thickness of their Coats, and particularly by the strength' of theif loneitudinal Muscular Fibres. O Carnivorous Quadrupeds, for the hiost part, have nd proper Colon. Instead of it, many have a widened Intestine, but not tacked up by Ligaments into Cells. On the contrary. Animals that feed on vegetables have a true Colon or Caecum, or both ; and the Colon is in general remarkably large in proportion, and di- vided into Cells by Tendinous Cords running lengthi ways, to retard the motion of the Food ; but to the above rules there are many exceptions. Among the Carnivora, some of the Bat tribe have a Cellular Colon. Tlie Oposmm, a real Carnivorous A-i nimal, has a long Caecum. The Intestinum Caecum is found in such Animals as have the Intestines distinguished into small and great! It appears merely as a jirolongation of the great Intes! tine at the termination of the small; but it varies much in size, form, and structure, in different Animals^ and not only in the same order, but in different Species of the same Genus. In many, particularly of the Cam’i- voi’a, it is wanting. In Carnivorous Animals, the Cmcum is small and uniform on its external surface, but is destitute of Cells. Exceptions occur to this rule, as some of the Bats and the Opossum, &c. which have the Caecum of great size. Herbivorous-Animals in general have a large Caecum', and this, like the Colon, is formed into Cells; but Rummantsr

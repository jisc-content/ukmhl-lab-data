In the substance of the Prepuce of the Gians of the Penis and Clitoris, in many of the Glires and Carnivo- ra, as the Rat, Lion, Civet, See. are two sets of Glands, termed Preputial, one consisting of simple Follicles, the other of Conglomerate Glands. Each sends out a Duct, which discharges a Sebaceous matter, to defend the parts near them. In the Prepuce of the Beaver are similar Glands, which furnish the Castor. They form a mass, that has a bag near it which contains this .substance, and opens at each side of the chink common to the Anus and Penis. In the male MtisJc Goat, (Moschus Moscifer), are parts similar, and similarly si- tuated, to those of the Castor. They are of an oval form, and are full of Follicles, which separate the Musk. In the Hare, and the greater part of Ruminants, are Glands under the Skin of the Groin, and therefore termed inguinal, which secrete a Sebaceous foetid sub- stance, and send it into Cavities from which it is dis- charged by an orifice at each side of the Prepuce. In many of the Glires, but especially in Land and Amphibious Carnivora, as the Badger, Civet, Pole-cat, Dog, Fox, Lion, &c. peculiar Glands and Bags are found near the outer end of the Rectum, and therefore called Anal. They are commonly of a spherical shape, and have a single orifice frequently ending at the side of’ the Anus. They secrete a matter of various’ colours, but commonly yellow or brown, of a strong disagree- able smell. In the Badger, Pole-cat, and Fox, the smell

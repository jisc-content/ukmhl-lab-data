OF REPTILES. Part III.] 281 OF Here, as in Birds, the Lymphatics of the Viscera of Digestion and Generation, and those of the Posterior Extremities, join in a Plexus, into which all the other Lymphatics of the Body pass. From this Plexus a short Canal goes out, on each side, which terminates in the Jugular Veins, or in the angles they form Avith the Subclavians. In the Turtle^ the Absorbents of the posterior parts of the Body go to a Plexus, which surrounds the Right Aorta, and then into a Reservoir situated more for- w^ards, under the Left Aorta. From this, two Thoracic ' Ducts, or rather several principal Branches, arise, Avhich advance to those under the Clavicles. Here they join with the Lymphatics of the Anterior Extremi- ties, and of the Head and Neck, and form two very in- tricate Plexus. From the Plexus of the right side, two Branches go out, which terminate in the Jugular Vein, near the angle it forms with the Subclavian. The Left sends out but a single Duct, that opens into the angle of the two Veins. The Absorbents under the Perito- neal Coat of the Intestines, run in straight parallel Branches, according to the length of the Bowel; and a good injection .shews them to cover almost the Avhole surface of the Gut. 'Hie inner surface is no less plen- tifully supplied Avith them, though here they have more the appearance of small Cells. From the Intestines, they go in company Avith the Mesenteric Blood-vessels, and form frequent Plexus and communications. At length they anastomose Avith the Absorbents of the other parts of the Abdomen, and discharge their contents into the Thoiâ€™acic 3Iucts.

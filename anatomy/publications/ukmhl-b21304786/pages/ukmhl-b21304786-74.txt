OF THE MUSCLES [Part I. US far as the Occiput. The Occipital portion of it, in Carnivora^ forms a Muscle termed Levator' Scapula’ Map-rius. The Omo-hyoicleus is wanting in Animals whicli have no Clavicle nor Coracoid Process, as in Dogs. The Subclavius is present in Animals with, but absent in those without Clavicles. Muscles the Arm.—All the Muscles of the Hume- rus exist here, but with some variety. The Pectoralis Major, as already mentioned, is generally more Fleshy, and divided into different portions. The Latissimus' Dorsi differs little. The Supra-spinatus, Infra-spina- tus, Subscapularis, Teres Major, and Teres Minor, differ chiefly in their proportions, corresponding with the form of the Scapula. The Coraco-brachialis exists in Quadrupeds in general; but in those wanting the Coracoid Process, it arises from the upper edge of the Scapula. Monlecys have the Coraco-brachialis divided into two portions, one of which extends along the whole length of the Humerus. JSIusclcs of the Fore-Arm.—The Biceps and Brachialis internus are similar in Monkeys to those in Man, except that the Brachialis arises almost as high as the Neck of the Humerus. In many Quadrupeds, as the Dog., Cat, Horse, &c. the Muscle corresponding to the Biceps has only one Head, which has no connection with the Coraco-Bra- chialis. In Morrkeys, the Triceps has an additional portion, wliich arises horn the Tendons of the Latissimus Dorsi and Teres INInjor. In many other Animals, this fourth portion is found. In Quadrupeds in general, the Ex- tensors

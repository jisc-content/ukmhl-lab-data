The CSe OF THE ALniEXTAKYCAN^L [Part III. the former class of Animals. In some of the Turtle kind, it is about five times the length of the Animal; but in some other Reptiles, as the F?'Og, it is scarcely twice ; and in some of the Serpent tribe, as the Coluber Matrix, it is not equal to the length of the Creature. The Small Intestines are generally much contracted in their diameter, while the large are as much dilated, though sometimes the reverse, as in the Hazck's-bill Turtle. In Turtles, in Lizards, in the Frog tribe, and SnaK'Cs, there is a \'ermiforni Process, but rarely any Caecum. Almost the whole of this class have a Circu- lar Fold or Valve between the small and great Intes- tines. d'he inner part of the Canal has Plica2, varying in the different kinds, and is lined with a large quantity of Mucus. In the Tortoise, there are no Cells in the great In- testines ; but the Canal in this, and some other Ani- mals of the class, is full of Fossula?. In Lizai'ds, and in the F)'og and Toad, the Colon is cylindrical, and much larger than the small Intestines In some of the Lizards, as the Crocodile of the Nile, the Plicae of the small Intestines have a zig-zag appearance. In the Chameleon, the small Guts equal the size of the Colon ; and in the Crocodile, the Colon little e.xcceds the small Intestines. In Snakes, the small Intestines are serpentine, and nearly equal in size with the Colon. '1 hcv have longi- tudinal Plicfc, while the Colon has irrca;ular Ruixm. The Intestinal Canal, in Reptiles, terminates in a C loacn, which is nearlv of the same nature as in Birds.

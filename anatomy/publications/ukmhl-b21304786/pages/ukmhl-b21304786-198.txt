Tlie Corpora Lutea are found after impregnation, and, in the Coxo in particular, are large and of a yellow colour; but in other Animals,- the colour varies accord- ing to the kind. The jMuscular Fibres in the Gravid IJterus become' less distinct than in the unimpregnated state. The changes of the simple Uterus without Horns, or that belonging to the Ape tribe, &c. considerably resemble those in "Woman. In the Uterus with Horns, the changes are accord- ing to the number of Foetuses the Mother carries. In Uniparous Animals, as the Mare^ the Foetus is confined to the Uterus. In the Coiv, it extends from the Uterus to one of the Cornua. In Multiparous A- ni'mals, one or more Foetuses are contained in each Hoi’n; in which last case, the Cornua, by their alter- nate contractions and dilatations, are formed into Cells. The Uterus Anfractuosus has the thinnest Coats of any, and suffers the least change by Impregnation. In" \\\QKangaroo after Impregnation, the communication be- tween the Vagina and Lateral Canals is completely shut up by inspissated Mucus. A minute orifice is describ- ed as being now close to the Urethra, and communicat- ing with the Uterus, though no opening is found here in the Virgin state. This, dilating at the time of par- turition, is found to discharge the Foetus into the Pouch or False Belly ; the parts, after delivery, re- turning to their original state. In the Opossum^ the changes by Impregnation arc not yet ascertained. 'Ihe connection between the impregnated L^terns and surface

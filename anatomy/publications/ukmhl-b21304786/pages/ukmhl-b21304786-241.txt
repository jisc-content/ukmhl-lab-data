Part II.] OF BIRDS. 235 Szcan and Cassoz^ary are observed to be exceptions to this last circumstance. In the Males of the Genus Anas, and Mergus, or Duck tribe, the Bronchi form Osseous Cavities, which give particular tones to their voice. The Lungs of Birds differ from those of the Animals of the former class, in several circumstances. They oc- cupy but a small part of what, in Quadrupeds, forms the Thorax; they are firmer in their texture, and not divided into Lobes, though separated above by the Ribs, the interstices of which they occupy. They ad- here, at their upper part, to the inner side of the Tho- rax through their whole length ; while below, they have a flattened appearance, where they lie over the Air- Cells. They adhere to the upper surface of the Pleura, in such a manner, that they may be considered as lying on the outside of the Cavity of the Chest. .They consist of two red spongy masses, which have less Cellular Sub- stance than in Mammalia, but the Cells are much larger in proportion. The Bronchi do not all end in the Cells of the Lungs; many terminate on their surface, the Pleura being here Cribriform, and allowing air to pass by considerable orifices into Cells, which conduct it through the whole Body. The Air Vesicles are of great size, but vary much in this, as well as in their form, in different Birds, and in different parts of the same Bird. They cover and inclose all the Viscera of the Thorax and Abdomen, and communicate by wide openings with each other. Most of the Cells are subdivided, especially in large Birds,

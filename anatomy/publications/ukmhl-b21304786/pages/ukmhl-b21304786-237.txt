231 OF BIRDS. Part II.] ture Is also the same as in the former class of Animals; but this system differs from that of Mammalia, in the Chyle being colourless and transparent, and in there being no visible Lymphatic Glands, neither in the Me- ' sentery, nor, in general, any where else, but at the bottom of the Neck ; though, in some of the larger Birds, a few Glands have been found in other parts ol' the Body. The Lymphatics of Birds have numerous communi- cations with each other, and form Insula', which are more frequent than in IMammiferous Animals. The Lymphatics of the Infeiior Extremities of the Pelvis, and of the Organs of Urine and Generation, and also those of the Chylopoietic and Assistant Chylo- poietic Viscera, join about the Cceliac Artery, and form a Plexus. From this are sent out two Thomcic Ducts, nearly of equal size, which advance under the Lungs, at each side of the Spine, and go to the inner part of the right and left Jugular Veins, where they terminate a little beyond the union of these Vessels with the Axil- laris. The Thoi-acic Duct of the Left Side receives a Branch from the Ventriculus Succenturiatus and Esophagus, and likewise the Lymphatics of the corresponding wing. The Absorbents of the Head and Neck accompany the Blood-vessels, and join near the lower part of the Neck, to form a Trunk which penetrates a Lymphatic Gland. From the opposite side of this Gland another Trunk issues, which, in the left side, terminates in the Thoracic Duct, while in the right, part of it goes to . the Thoracic Duct, and part to the Jugular Vein, near the Angle wdiich it forms with the Axillary.

In Adult Rirds, the Air-Cells not only communicate with each other by considerable apertures, but also . with the Cavities in tlie middle of the large Bones, of whatever form. In many, they extend to the Axillae, and under the Pectoral Muscles, and even along the Shoulders under the Skin of the "IVings and lateral parts of the Neck. This is found ]jarticularly to be the case in high-flying Birds, in which, also, they are remar’ ably large. They are extremely thin, but so dense, as to prevent tile air from escaping, except by the apertures which conduct it tlirough the Body. In large Birds, the Cells are furnished with Fasciculi of Muscular Fibres, considt'-red as a Substitute for tlie Diaphragm. These serve to expel the air received in inspiration, and send it back by the Lungs and Tra- chea, in which they are assisted by the Muscles on the Thorax, Abdomen, &c. The distension of these Cells serves to render the A- nimal lighter in flying, so as to buoy it up in the air, and diminish the necessity of Inspiring frequently in a long or rapid flight; and also in singing or swimming’; and in largj b irds, as the Ostrich and Cassoxvanj, iu running. 1 hey answer, besides, as a kind of secondary Lungs to the Blood, and are useful in the expulsion of the Fa?ces, Urine, and contents of the Genital Organs. They are also concerned in respiration, the Langs possessing

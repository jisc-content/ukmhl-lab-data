101 OF MAMMALIA. Part I.] lindrical; in otliers, flattened; in Apes, it is nearly as in Man ; in Carnivora and Ruminants, it passes di- rectly inwards; in some, as the Otter and Pole-cat, it goes in a retrograde direction; in the Roclentia, it is directed dowâ€™nwards ; in the Mole, where it is quite flat, it has the Membrana Tympani laid over it like a roof; in the Elephant and Horse, it goes dowmwards and backwards. In some Animals which dive in the water, it is pro- vided with a Valve, as in the case of the Water Shreve, and some Whales. In the Cetacea, the Osseous Canal, like the External Auricle, is wanting; in place of which there is a Cartilaginous Tube, which begins by an ori- flce proportionally very minute, on the surface of the Skin, and leads in a grinding direction through the Fat, till it terminates at the Membrana Tympani, In the Ornithorrynchus, also, the Meatus is observed to be long and tortuous, Tlie Membrana Tympani, the Tympanum, and the Eustachian Tube, are found to be common to all Mam- malia ; and the Membrane of the Tympanum appears to be concave externally in all the individuals of the class, the Cetacea not excepted. Its structure nearly re- sembles that in the Human Body, It is fixed in a case of Bone, which is commonly open above, and is some- Avhat of an oval form, with the long diameter placed in a vertical, or in an oblique direction, though it varies in this last respect considerably in different Animals, The Tympanum differs in size, form, and situation. It is oval in some, round or hemispherical in others, G 3 and

Claws arc wanting in the Wings of Birds, where they could not be used, either for walking, or seizing ^he prey. OF THE BRAIN, S^c. ^l^HE Mevihrancs of the Brain correspond, in number and general appearance, with those of the former class. Jn some Birds, there is even a Falx, and this, in the Wood-cock and Orrdthorrynchus, is of an Osseous na- ture. The proportional size of the Brain of the Animals of this class varies extremely ; but it is found, that the Brain of the smaller Birds bears a greater proportion to the size of the Body, than that of the larger kinds. While, in the Sparrow, it is a 25th, and in the Gold- jinch, a 14th of the weight of their Body ; in \he Eagle, it is only a 160th, and in the Goose, a 660lh. The Brain cor.tists of two large masses, which form the Ilemisj.heres, the two Thalami Optici, the Cere- bellum, and Medulla Oblongata. The Hemupheres are in form of a Fleart, with the •base turned backward. There are no Convolutions, iior Corpus Callosum, nor Fornix, nor Septum Lu- cidum.

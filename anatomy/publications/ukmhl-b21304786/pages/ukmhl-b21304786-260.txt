OF THE FEMALE OKGAXS [ Fari 11- 254 Amnios, Yolk, and IMcnibvancs c-f the Albameir, iu Avhich last substance the greater part .of tlie Branches are expanded. Tlie lining of the Shell is now cover- ed with Blootl-vossels, expanded upon a Membrane wliich forms the Chorion. Near the end of Iix-.ubatioii', the Umbilical Vessels begin to shrivel, and, at tl>e ex- clusion of the Chick, are quite diminutive. Production of the Chick.—At the end of the ftrst daV, a small white spot, the Aldu,^ PuUi, sen CoHiquamenfuiiiy is discerned near tlie Cicatricula. On the second day, the (,’hick is observcxl in the form of a Gelatinous Filament, and the Cicatricula soon afterwards vanishes. At the end of the second day, Bkxjd-vessels appear upon the sur- face of the Yolk, and these soon become connected to the Chick. The A'^astadar jiart is termed Figura Veno- 6'a, or Area l^a-iculosa. The Arteries arise from the Mesenteric ; the principal AYln goes to the Porta. Be- sides the Blood-vessels, a Canal is ll)rmctl in the coiu-so of Incubation, which joins the Membrane of the Yolk to the Intestinuin Ilium of the Chick, under the name of Duciu.s Vitello-intestinaUs. Third day, the Punctum Salicns, or Hcai't, ajipears, and is distinguished by its motion. The Spine is seen in a curved state, with pro- minences, Avhich are the Bniin and Eyes, the latter of which are remarkable for their great proportional size. Fourth day, the Abdominal Viscera appear, after which the Extremities sprout out. A A’ascular IMembranc, the Cho7-ion, or Menibi'anu Uvibilicalis, begins to form about the ^ Navel, whicli, increasing by degrees, lines almost the whole inner surface of the INIembrana Alba- minis during the latter half of the period of Incuba- tion.

OF MOLLUSCA. Iâ€™abt V.] 343 posed of a Membrano-nuiscular substance, termed CloaJc. This, in the greater part of the Species, is covered by Shells of various forms, and furnished with complete hinges. These hinges are connected by Idgaments placed in different, parts of the Shell according to the kind, and of such an elastic nature as to have a constant tendency to open the Shell. The Cloak varies much in the dif- ferent Genera. Most frequently it is open before, as in the Oydcr^ Muscle, &c. Sometimes it is perforated at both extremities, as in the Razor-shell, &c. The Cloak of the Oyster is formed, like the Shell, of two pieces fixed next the hinge, and has a semi-transparent ap- pearance. The pieces are perforated by the Muscle which closes the Shell. The opening which receives the nourishment, and that for discharging the Faeces, are formed by the Cloak, and these are sometimes pro- longed into a Proboscis. In the Oyster Muscle, tlrere is only one of tliese openings, which is the Anus ; the nourishment entering by a slit in the Cloak. The Valves of the Shells are closed by one or two Muscles, according to the shape of the part. In the Oyster, and others of a similar form, there is only a single Muscle, but of great strength. It is situated near the centre of the Shell, and behind the Liver. It is fixed firmly to both portions of the Shell, and shuts them with great force; the elastic Ligament at the hinge acts as an antagonist, by opening the Shell. In the Muscle, Cockle, Razor-shell, &c. there are two Muscles for shutting the Shell, and they are placed near the hinge. Many Acephalous Mollusca have a locomotive power, Y 4 in

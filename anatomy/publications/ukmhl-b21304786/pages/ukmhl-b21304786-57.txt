In the Ape and Elephant, the edge next the Spine is, as in Man," the longest; in most other Quadrupeds, it is the shortest. The Coracoid Process is commonly wanting,' though present in many; In the Pig, the Spine of the Bone is almost effaced near the Humeral Extremity; but about its middle, there is a large projecting Process. Arm.'i—\n all Animals, the Os Humeri is single in each Anterior Extremity, as in the Human Arm, and becomes shorter as the Metacarpus is elongated. In Animals with a single Metacarpal Bone, the Os Humeri is deeply seated in the Fleshy parts of the Thorax. There is often a hole in a kind of Linea Aspera which projects in the Arm-Bone,- and frequent- ly a perforation in the Bone where it receives the Ole^ cfanon. In the Mole, the Os Humeri is peculiar, not only for its" shortness, but in being articulated by one small head to the Scapula, and by another to the Clavicle. It is altogether of such a nature as to turn the Palm out- wards, for working with the Hand: Fore-arm.—The motiorfe of Supination and Prona- tion are found in the Anterior Extremity of a few Ge- nera only, and these are chiefly for enabling the Ani- mals to lay hold of, or search for, their food. In Apes, the Bones have the same general appear- ance as in Man, but the Radius is the principal Bone. The Bat has no Ulna, or only the Rudiment of one. D 2 In'

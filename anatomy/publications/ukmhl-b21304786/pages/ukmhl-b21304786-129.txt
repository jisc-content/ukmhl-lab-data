123 OF MAMMALIA. Part I.] are The Front Teeth of the Upper Jaw are fixed In the Intermaxlhary Bone, which includes also the Tusks of the Elephant^ Walrus, and Narzcal. Tlie number and form of the Teeth varies considera- bly in different Mammalia. In the Glires, the cutting edges of the Incisores are in the form of a Chizel. The Teeth of some Animals, as the GUrcs, are co- vered widi Enamel only on their anterior surface, but this is continued along the roots; hence, as the Osseous part v/ears down sooner than the Enamel, the Animal is still capable of gnawing hard substances. The Teeth of the Glires, the Tusks of th Elephant and Hippopotamus, and others of a similar nature, are in a constant state of growth, in consequence of a Pulpy Vascular Substance Avithin them, upon which the Os- seous part of the Tooth is formed ; so that the interior part of the Tooth advances to supply the portion worn t down, The Teeth of the Lower Jaw of some of the Ani- mals of this order, as the Squirrel, Rat, and Beaver, are remarkable for the length of their roots, which nearly equals that of the Jaw itself, though a small por- tion only appears beyond the Gums. They are curved back under the roots of the Grinders, and sometimes go as far as the Goronoid Processes. The Tusk of the Narzcal occupies the place of an Incisor, and is almost constantly found single, the other one being either early destro^^ed, or lurking in the Jaw.

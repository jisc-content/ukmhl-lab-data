OF MAMMALIA. lOJ Part I.] are not connected to the Bones of the Cranium, as in other ISIammalia, but are loosely attached by Liga- ments. The Eustachian Tube, in ^Mammalia, has nearly the same kind of structure and openings as in Man. In the Horse, it communicates with a large Sac placed in the lateral and posterior part of the Mouth. In the Cetacea, it is of great size, and terminates at the Nose or Blowing Hole, where there is a Valve to prevent the water from rushino; into it when thrown out by this opening. The Osslcula Audltus are the same in number in al- most all Mammalia, but they vary much in form and size in the different Species. In some Quadrupeds, as the Mole, Marmot, and Guinea Pig, a Process is found, which extends from one side of the Fenestra Ovalis to the other, and passes between the Crura of the Stapes, so that, when the Stapes is removed, there appears to be two Fenestrae Ovales. In the Whale, that Bone has very nearly an entire Plate, instead of tv/o Crura. In some of the Bisulca, one or two additional Bones are occasionally Ibund. The Ornitliorrynchus, on the contrary, has only two Ossicula, the second of which approaches in its form to the single Bone in Birds, (see Phil. Trans. 1805.) The Muscles of the Internal Ear of Mammlferous A- nimals appear to be nearly the same as in Man. The figure and size of the Fenestra Rotunda, and Fenestra Ovalis, are found to vary considerably. In some, as the Bear, the Cochlear Foramen is triangular ; G d in

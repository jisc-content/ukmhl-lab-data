Each of the Columns is intercepted by a great number of Lamina?, forming the whole into so many Cells, which are here of a rhomboidal form. They receive their principal Nerves from the Spinal Marrow ; some of less consideration coming from the Sympathetic Fair. Of the Silurus, the Organ covers the greater part of the Body. It begins at the Head, and extends to near the Tail, and forms a thick Stratum anteriorly, but be- comes thinner as it approaches the Caudal extremity. It receives its Nerves from those portions of the Eighth Pair which extend, in other Fishes, along the lateral parts of the Body ; but these are much smaller in proportion than in the Torpedo. Of' THE EYE, The Eye of the Animals of this class is proportionally larger than in the two former, that of the Cod greatly exceeding the size of the Human Eye.

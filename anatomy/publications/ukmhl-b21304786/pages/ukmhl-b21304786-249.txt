Paut II.] OF BIRUS. (,) 2 The Birds, they arc commonly long, and of considerable diametoi*. In nocturnal Birds of pi'ey, they are in ge- neral very large ; but in the diurnal Birds of prey, they are wanting, or of inconsiderable siiie. 'Hiere are many exceptions to the alx>ve rules. In the Odricli, the Caca are remarkable for their spiral Valves. From the end of the Iliinn, and also from the Caeca, when present, the Colon is sent off*, which is proportion- ally short, and differs from that in many of the Indivi- duals of the former class, in not being formed into Cells. In the Ostrich, however, the Colon, as it advances, , becomes tacked up into Cells, and gradually increases in diameter, contrary to what happens in other Animals. The Intestines are fixed to the Body by the Mesen- tery, which arises from the Spine opposite the Anterior Mesenteric Artery. It is of considerable breadth where it is attached to the small Intestine: but what beloniis to the Colon is narrow, this Gut being more firmly fixed than the rest. The Rectum, previous to its ending in the Anus, forms a dilatation termed Cloaca, which is susjjended under the Os Coccygis, and receives the terminations of the Ureters, the ends of the Vasa Defcrentia, and ]*enis, where it exists ; the opening of the Oviduct in the Female, and the orifices from the Bag termed Barm Fauricii. d'he Cloaca varies in form in different Species, but has more or less of an oval appearance. It serves as a reservoir of Urine and Faeces in both sexes. It is moved by various Muscles which arise from the Bone.s in the neighbourhood.

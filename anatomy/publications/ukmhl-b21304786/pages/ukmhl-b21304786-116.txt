OF I HE NOSE (Part I. no Fera', as the there is only a double roll some- thing 1 ke tliat in Pecora. CartUugca.—The Cartilages of the Nose vary con- siderably in different Quadrupeds. Those in the Ajie tribe differ from the analogous parts in Man chiefly in their diminutive .size. The Muscles affecting the Nose, in these Animals, appear to be part of the Panniculus Carnosus. In Carnivorous Animals, as the Dog^ in which the Nose does not project beyontl the Mouth, the Carti- lages also bear a considerable resemblance to those in the Human Species. In Carnivorous Animals with move- able Snouts, as the Mole and Bca?-, the Cartilages form a complete Tube, which is connected to the c^Ige of the Osseous part of the Nose. The Snout of the Hog bears a considerable resem- blance to that of the Mole, but its Cartilages are shorter in proportion. The Nose of Carnivorous Animals has distinct lonoi- O tudinal jMuscles, the ends of which, and the Snout it- self, are covered with circular Fibres, continued from the Orbicular Muscles of the Lips, as already observed. In Solipech and Rum'mmits, the Osseous Nares arc large, and have a Notch in their lateral parts. The soft portion of the Nose, connected to the Bones, forms the Nostrils, strictly so called, the edges of w'hich, in the Horse, inclose a Cai’tilage, called Semilunar. The rest of the cxtenial part is merely a fold of the Skin, and forms a Cavity termed False Haris, w'hich has the same common opening with the Nostril. The Muscles' of the Nose are noticed in a former part of the Volume. The Pituitary Membrane agrees in its general struc- ture

Sometimes they are observed to be bathed in a milky liquor, which is supposed to be the Semen. The Echinus has five Lobes in the Ovarium or Roe^ These open by several Ducts, which communicate, and pierce the Shell near the Anus. The Ovaria form die eatable part of this Animal. In the Asterias, the Ovaria form also five Lobes, one for each Branch of the Body, and these are composed of the Ova, which have a reddish colour.

The Zoophytes properly so called, have no Genera- live Organs ; they propagate by Buds and Slips, some- thing after the ‘ manner of the growth in Branches of Trees. In the Actinia and Polypi, the young sprout out from any part of the external surface of the Parent. When VoL. IV. B b they

120 OF THE MOUTH, &c. [Part I,. In the Cetacea, the Velum is changed into a Canal, by which the Posterior Nares are prolonged about the pyramid ot' the Larynx, and their posterior part conti- nued witli the Pharynx. Pharynx.—The Pharynx, in Mammalia in general, lias nearly the same structure as in l\Ian, but stronger on account of the necessary force required in their ho- rizontal situation. It exists in all Vertebral Animals, but particularly in Mammalia. In many, as the E,le- j)hant, Bear, &c. there is a jiroper Pliaryngeal Muscle, which is merely a continuation of the Muscular Coat of the Esophagus. Bursa: Faucium.—Many Species of the Ape, and also of the Mannot, are pi'ovided with Glandular Sacs, or Cheek Pouches, termed Bursae Faucium, placed behind the Palate, and serving as a temporary resei'voir for the Fo(xl. The Camel has this structure also, which is supposed to be intended for containing fluids to lubricate the Throat in the sandy deserts. The Orniihorrynchus is also found to have Cheek Pouches. In the Cetacea, the Pharynx is separated into two by the Larynx, whidi forms a pyramid that can rise as high as the Posterior Nares, and, by entering these, can allow the aliment to pass by each side of it to the Esopliagus. There is also a particular Canal which rises from the Pharynx, and is attached to the margin of the Posterior Nares, or Blowing Holes. The cir- cular Fibres of this Canal form a Sphincter, which, by contracting round the Pyramid, cuts off the communi- cation

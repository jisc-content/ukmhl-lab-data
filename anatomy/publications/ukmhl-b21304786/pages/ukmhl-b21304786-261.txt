The Chorion consists of innumerable Arteries and Veins ; tlie latter are distinguished from the former by being filled with pure red Blood, while the Arte- ries have a livid appearance, on account of transmit- ting carbonated Blood from the xVnimal. The Chorion is therefore considered as supplying the office of Respi- ratory Organs, while the Chick lies in the Amnios, and is prevented from breathing. Fifth day, the Lungs are perceived. Sixth, there is voluntary motion. Ninth, Ossification commences; traces of yellow Ves- sels on the Yolk-bag, Vasa VitcUi Lutea, begin to appear. These afterwards expand in the substance of the V'olk, and, by degrees, carry it into the Veins of the Yolk-bag for the nourishment of the Chick. Fourteenth, the Feathers are discerned. Nineteenth, the Animal has the power of using its Vocal Organs, and, some time before its exclusion, may frequently be heard making the same kind of sound that Chickens make after they are hatched; and this in consequence of breaking with the Beak, the Air-bag placed at the great end of the Shell. Tw'enty-first, it makes its ap- pearance, sometimes by bursting the Shell irregularly, at other times perforating the larger end with its Beak. AVhile the Chick lies in the Shell, it is coiled up, with its Neck bent forwards, the Head covered by the Wing, and the Yolk between its Legs. Directly after leaving the Shell, the remains of the Yolk and its Bag are observed in the Abdomen ; the former is taken into the Intestines, and serves for nourishment till the Animal acquires strength enough for another kind of Food.

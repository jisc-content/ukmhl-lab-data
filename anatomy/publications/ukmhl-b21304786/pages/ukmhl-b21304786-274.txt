OF THE BRAIN [Part IIL ^G8 • nium. In some, it is several thousand times less than the Body, and without being divided into Circumvolu- tions. It is covered by the same Membranes as in Mamma- lia and Birds, but the Dura Mater has no Processes. The Cerebrum consists of four roundish eminences, viz. two Hemispheres, and two Thalami Optici, which are remarkable in their situation, being placed behind the Hemispheres. It has Lateral Ventricles, with Corpora Striata, and a Ventricle besides, in each of the Thalami, which communicates with the third. This last has an Anterior and Posterior Commissure, but the Nates and Testes are wanting. The Cerebellum lies behind the Cerebrum, and has no Arbor Vitm. A fourth Ventricle exists in the Turtle, and probably also among the other orders of the class. The Spinal Mar row, in mo.st of the Sj^ecies, is of great size when compared with the Brain. 'I'he Olfactory Nerves arise from the Anterior Extre- mities of the Hemispheres, and go to the Nose, after the same manner as in Birds. The Canals receiving them have a common opening from the Cranium. The Optic Nerves are less or more connected, as in the two former classes ; but there is scarcely any union of their Medullary Substance. The Third Pair also agree in general with those in Birds and Mammalia. The Fourth are nearly similar in all red-blooded Animals. I’lie Fifth, as in the for- mer Animals, are also divided into three Branches. The Sixth agree with those of Mammalia and Birds. Of the Seventh Pair, the Portio Dura is small, there being

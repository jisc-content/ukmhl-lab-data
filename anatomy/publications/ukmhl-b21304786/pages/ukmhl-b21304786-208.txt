202 [Part II. OF THE BONES the Extr-emlty is forked, one of die Branches resting upon the Body of the Vertebra, the other upon its J rans- verse Process. The Sternal Extremity has an Osseous Appendage supplying the place of Cartilage. '1 he middle of the Bib has a flat Process directed upwards and backwartls over the following Jlib, each in this manner supporting die other. The number of the Ribs is less than in the Human Body ; they are not found to exceed ten pairs. The Sternum is of great ])roportional size, covering not only the Brea.st, but a large part of the Belly. In- ternally it is concave, externally convex, and is ex- tended helow into a ridge termed Crista, resembling the keel of a ship. This, with the under surface of the Bone in general, serves for the attachment of the very strong Pectoral Muscles, that move the Wings. In some Birds, as the Ostrich and Cassowary, which have not the power of flying, the Sternum is flat below, and there is no Crista. The Wings are connected to the Sternum by three Bones, viz. two Clavicles, and the Furcula, Fork-like Bone, or Merry-thought. The Clavicle is articulated with the anterior edge of the Sternum, and has little motion. It is divided into two short processes, one connected to the Furcula, the other to the Scapula, with which it forms a Cavity for the reception of the Humerus. The Furcula is remarkable in Birds, and is seldom w'anting. It is in form of a V, common to both Shoulders, and is joined by its point to the most pro- minent part of the Crista of the Sternum, while the other extremities are connected to the Humeral end of

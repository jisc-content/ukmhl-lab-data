OF MAMMALIA. Faut I.] 179 tween the different llundles of the Seminal Tubes of the Testicle, to protect and bind these together. The form and relative size of the Epididymis varies much in different Animals. In most Mammalia, it is fixed to the 'I'esticle, as in Man ; but in many of the GUres, as the Rat, and in Animals with a I’oucli, it is connected to the Testicle only by two thin Cords. 'J he Fasa Defercntia, as in Man, are thick and firmj but thinner when the Testes lie constantly in the Ab- domen. As in the Human Species, also, the Vasa Deferentia, in many Animals, are enlarged, and are Cellular internally, for some space previous to their termination. The Cells, in the Horse, and also in the Ram, have small orifices internally, from which a thick white fluid can be pressed into them. In \\\q Elephant, the dilatation is of a Globular form. Most Mammalia possess Vesicidce Seminales, which, in many, as in some Apes, but particularly in the Iledg-e-hv^, are greatly enlarged, like the Testicle, when these Animals are in season. The Vesiculae exist in Apes, in Bats, in the Glires, in the Hedge-hog and.ffa- coon, in Solipeds, and in the Bellucc. They are wanting in the Ornitho7'ryn''hus, in Car- nh'ora, in Ruminants, unless two small Glandular Cap- sules, considered by some as Prostate Glands, be taken for such,—and in the Cetacea. There is no rule yet known with respect to the presence or the absence of these. Their form and structure vary exceedingly in differ- ent Mammalia. They are commonly Membranous and Cellular, but in many cases they have a Glandular ]M 2 appearance

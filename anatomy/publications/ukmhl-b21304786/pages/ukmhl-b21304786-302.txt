PART IV. OF FISHES. OF THE BOXES. P isiiES have in general a Spine, extending from the Cranium to the Tail Fins, and have the Fins at the un- der part of the Belly articulated with Bones peculiar to them. The Bones of the Cranii(m are firmly united together by indistinct Sutures. In Osseous Fishes, the Bones are very numerous; but in several of the Cartilaginous, as the Skate, the (hnnium is chiefly in one continued piece. In general, the Cranium bears a small propor- tion to the rest of the Head, but is large â– when com- pared with the size of the Brain it incloses. It is not marked in the inside by the Brain, not being moulded ' upon it as in IMammalia. '^I'he Cranium of Osseous F'ishes is broad between the liars, these Organs being contained in the same com- mon Cavity with the Brain. In Cartilaginous Fishes, the Ears are separated by a distinct Septum. Fishes, as Birds, have a partition between the Eyes, which has been compared to a Vomer ; and this is generally Mem- branous, though in some Osseous. In Fishes of the Cartilaginous kind, the Under Jaze differs from that in the Osseous, in not beine' articulated

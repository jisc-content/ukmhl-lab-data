OF THE FEMALE ORGANS [Part I. Irom ihe Mamma vary much. In general, though with many exceptions, the number is about twice that of the Foetuses whicli the Animal commonly produces at a Birth, to give, along with the extended Mamma, an opportunity for suckling all the young at the same time. The Teat is commonly hollow within, the Cavity communicating with two reservoirs, in which the Lac- tiferous Tubes terminate. It has only one or two ori- fices externally. Of the number of the Teats in Mammalia, there are generally. Two Inguinal in the Sheep, Goat, Mare, and Cetacea. Four Inguinal in the Cow, Deer, and Camel. Four Abdominal in the Lioness and Panther. Ten Abdominal in the Sow. Six Abdominal, and Four Pectoral, in the Bitch, Hare, and Rabbit. Four Abdominal, and Four Pectoral, in the Cat. Eight Abdominal, and from Two to Four Pectoral, in the Rat. Two Abdominal, and Four Pectoral, in the Bear. Four Abdominal, and Six Pectoral, in the Hedge-hog.- Two Pectoral in the Ape, Bat, and Elephant. The Nipples are sometimes found, but in smaller number, in the Male, as in the Dog; or in a different situation, as on the sheath of the Penis in the Horse ; and there are numerous instances where Milk has been secreted in the Mammae of Male Animals, as the Dog, Cat, &c.; and Milk, or a fluid similar to it, is com- monly found in the Mammae of newly-born Quadrupeds of both sexes, as well as in the Breasts of Children.

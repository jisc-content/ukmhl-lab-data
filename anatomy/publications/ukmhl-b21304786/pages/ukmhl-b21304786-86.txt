OF THE INTEGUMENTS [Part I. 80 root of the Antler. The growth is commonly finished betbre the end of the third month. IVhen it is completely formed, it loses its covering of Skin and Periosteum, in consequence of the Vessels at its root being obstructed, and remains afterwards quite bare; and no distinction can now be ob-served, but an irregular projection of a cii'cular form at its base. When it dro})s from the Head, the Integuments close over the Bone witb which it was connected, till the ])eriod of its renewal returns, w'hen a Process pro- jects, and forms the succeeding Antler, which is always' found to be longer than the preceding one. It is also observed, that the Branches of the Carotid Artery, which supply this substance, are dilated during its growth, but return to their former dimensions when it has acquired its full size. The Nails and Clares cover the last Phalanx of the Toes of Quadrupeds, and are of the same nature, and formed after the same manner, as Horns. They grow from the base to which the Integuments are fixed, and commonly cover the upper part of the Toes; but in some, as the Squirrel, Rat, &c. they entirely surround them. They belong to Quadrupeds in general, and are orginally formed before the birth of the Animal, 'riieir colour, as in the Horns, depends upon that of the Corpus Mucosum. They serve for rubbing, scraping, and for catching the prey, and, in general, for protecting the extremities of the Toes.' They have no sensibility but at their I'oots.

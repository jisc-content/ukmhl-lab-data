The Milk Molares are distinguished from the permanent set, by being longer from before backward tlian in a transverse direction. The age of the Sheep is known by the replacing of the Incisors. In the Asiatic Elephant, the Temporary Tusks drop out in twelve or thirteen months, and are succeeded by the Permanent Tusks, which continue growing through life. The Molares appear in the second week after birth ; they are succeeded by the second in the second year; tlie third succeed in the sixth year; the fourth in the ninth year; others follow, but their epochs are not known. The succession in the iMolares of the Elephant, is particularly observed by Mr Corse, (Phil. Trans. 1T99.) There is never more than one Grinder, and part of an- other, seen through the Gum. The Body of the ante- rior one is gradually worn away by mastication; the rest of the Tooth is carried off by absorption, the pos- terior Tooth coming forward to supply its place. The same Processes are found to be repeated at least eight times, and each new Grinder is larger than the for- mer. The first, or Milk Grinder, is composed of four se- parate plates, or partial Teeth, which gradually unite, and cut the Gum between the first and second week after birth. Each succeeding Grinder has an additional number of plates, the last having in all about twenty. It is observed, besides, that every new Grinder takes a year or more than the former for its formation. From VoL. IV. I the

Upon certain parts of the Integuments there are Glandsy that separate an oily matter, w'ith which they anoint their Feathers. These are found under the Skin of the crop ; but the greater part of this substance is discharged, by one or more orifices, from a Gland si- tuated upon the Rump. With the contents of this, the Duck, by means of the Bill, frequently besmears the Feathers. The Feathers are wanting in young Birds. When they first leave the Egg, they are covered with Hair, tbrmed into Fasciculi, eacli of which grows from a common Bulb, that gives origin to the future Feathers. The Hair is soon succeeded by Sheaths, giving pas- sage to the Feathers, the inner ends of which are sup- plied with Blood-vessels, that form first the Barrel, then the Stalk of the Quill. The inner part of the Feathers is at first composed of a Pulpy substance, inclosed in Cells. The Pulp is by degrees absorbed, and the part assumes the appearance of a Corpus Cavernosum. The Stalk is convex on one side, and concave, and furrowed in the middie, on the other. Upon the sides of the Stalk are Barhes, composed of Horny Laminae, and beset laterally w ith Hairs or Bar- bules. The Feathers on the Wings and Tail are term- ed

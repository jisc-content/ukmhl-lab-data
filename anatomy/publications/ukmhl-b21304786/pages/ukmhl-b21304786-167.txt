VoL. IV. L The Part I.] OF MAMMALIA. IGI In the Rat, Hare, Castor, and Porcupine, the Cajcum is so large as to fill a great part of the Abdomen. In the Rat tribe, which are Pmnivorous, the Canal is shorter than in the other Glires; but the Caecuin surpasses the size of the Stomach, tliough it varies much in the different kinds. The Appendix Vermi- formis, as already noticed, is found only in the Phas~ colome. In the Hare and Rabbit, the Cascum is longer than the whole Animal, and is furnished internally with a pe- culiar Spiral Valve. The Colon is also dilated. In the Beaver, the Rectum and Urethra have a com- mon termination. Of the Ferae, the Hedge-Hog has neither a proper Colon nor a Caecum. The Badger, which is not strict- ly a Carnivorous Animal, and the Glis Esculentus, or RelUmouse, have no distinction between small and great Intestines. The Hedge-Hog, Bear, and some other Animals of this kind, that walk upon the soles of their feet, and are Omnivorous, have a long but narrow Canal, and no Caecum, nor distinction of large Intestines. In the Opossum, there is a long Colon, and a large Caecum. The Kangaroos have no Cells in the Canal, but have a large Caecum. In the Dog, the Duodenum is fixed at the Pylorus to the Liver, but afterwards a large portion hangs loOse in the Abdomen. The inner side of the Intestine has Valvulae Conniventes, but placed in a longitudinal di- rection. The Caecuin makes turns upon the Ilium.

Reptiles have likewise their PapilltB Nervosoe^ but. these aiv; found chiefly in the Feet. The Glands of the Skin are more visible in this than in some of the prec-eding classes. In the Lizanl, there is a range of Follicles under each Buttock, which dis- charge a viscid humour. In the Toad, Glands are ir- regularly dispersed over the Skin; and in the Salaman- der, along the Back, which throw out an acrid matter, especially when the Aninmls are irritated; yet these Reptiles are often handled with impunity.

The Clau'S on the Digits of the individuals of this class, are wanting wherever the Animal does not use its feet for seizing its prey, or for walking, as in tlie Tortoise, Frog, &c. I OF THE TRAIN.

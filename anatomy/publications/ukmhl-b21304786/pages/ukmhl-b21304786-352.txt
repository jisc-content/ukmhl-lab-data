[Fact V. OF iMOLLUSCA. 5}40 ced upon the outer extremities of the Horns, thougli it is not yet lully ascertained whether tliese parts are real organs of vision. The Muscles which affect them arise o from the edges of the Foot of the Animal, and ex- tend as far as tlie Eyes. By tliese the Tentacula are drawn to the Head, something after the manner of an inverted Finger of a Glove. By a set of Circular Fibres contracting in succession, the Eye is restored to its for- nter external appearance. The Organ of Hearing in the Cuttle-Fish is a simple Bajr, concealed in the Annular Cartilage at the base of tlie great Tentacula. In the Sepia Officinalis^ the Sac has a Bone suspended in the Fluid which it contains. In the Sepia Octopus^ there is only a chalky substance. The Organ of Smell is supposed to belong to many of the Mollusca, but the situation is unknown. The Lips, in the Animals of this class, are in some short or real Lips; in others, elongated into a Tube or Proboscis. In the Cephalopoda, they are in form of a fleshy circle; in the Gasteropoda, they are merely a lon- gitudinal Slit. The Proboscis in many IMollusca, as the Whelk, &c. is a fleshy Tube for seizing the Food at a distance. It forms a kind of double cylinder, which can move in every direction, and retract within the Body. The Tongue varies much in length in some of this (flass, as the Limpet, where it is ahnost as long as the Boiily ; but in such cases there is no Proboscis. In the Lephalopoda and Gasteropoda, the ^I'ongue is covered with Spines directed backwards. The Sepia, Snails, and greater part of the Gasteropoda, have a Cartilagi- nous

or THE KIDNEYS [Part III. ed into a mass. They are long and flat in lAzords and Frog'n. In the Serjn’nts, they form a sort of cliain. Tlie Ureters arise as in Birds/^ In the Turtle, they terminate in the beginning of the Urethra, from whence tlie Urine <>ocs into tlie Bladder. In many of the c5 * t:ard tribe, the Ureters terminate in a Bladder, which is of considerable extent, and the Urethra opens into a Cloaca. In the Crocodile, the Ureters end in a Cloaca, there being no Bladder. In Serjients, each Ureter di- lates into a ^Tsicle, which terminates in a Cloaca. In general, they end in a Bladder or a Cloaca, as the Or- gan happens to exist. The Bladder, when present, re- ceives the Urine at its Neck, or at the beginning of the Urethra, and opens directly into the Cloaca. In the Genus viz. the and Toad, there are two Bags, taken notice of by BLUME^'BACII and Cu- vier, as Urinary Bladders. Townson, however, describes the Ureters in these Animals as terminating at the posterior part of the Rec- tum, as in Birds, while the Receptacles here mentioned, and which are of great size, terminate at its anterior part; and is of opinion, that the fluid they contain is pure water, which he has frequently tasted. He thinks this fluid is absorbed from the surface of the Skin, and serves the same purpose to these Animals, as fluids do to those which take them into the Stomach bv the IMouth ; that the fluid they eject prevents an inconve- nience in leajiing. In the Turtle tribe, the bottom of the Bladder di- vides into two (’ornua. The Urethra, which is ex- tremely short, opens into the Cloaca. There are two projections

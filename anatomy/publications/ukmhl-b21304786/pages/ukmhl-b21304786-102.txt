96 OF ;rHE EYE [Part I. mals of this class, as the Leopard^ Horse, Ox, Wliale, &c. In some of tlie Glires, as the Hare and Rabbit, and in the Carnivora, Solipeds, Ruminants, Belluae, and the Cetacea, there is a real Pigmentum Nigrum at the fore part of the Eye; but at the Back and Temporal Side, the colour is brilliant, and is termed Tapetum Lucidum. This is wanting, however, over the entrance of the Optic Nerve. In the Horse, Goat, and Deer, the Ta- petum is of a silver blue, changing into violet. In the Ox, it is green, changing into a sky blue; in the Sheep, green ; in the Cat kind. Bear, and Dolphin, pale yellow; in the Badger, Dog, and Fox, it is blue, changing into white. In general, the paint is brightest in night- watching Animals, the brightness reflecting more light upon the Retina. Wherever the Pigmentum exists in the Eye, it is of a black colour where it lines the fore part of the Choroides and back of the Iris. In some entirely white Animals, as the White Rabbit, White Mouse, &c. there is no paint upon the inner side of the Eye; in such cases, there is a great degree of redness, owing to the Blood-vessels of the Choroides shining through the Retina and Humours; where, however, there is the least spot of a dark colour, this is not always observed. The Optic Nerve commonly passes through a Cribri- form part in the bottom of the Eye, and has in gene- ral the same appearance, and same kind of termination, as in the Human Subject. Jn some Animals, as the Hare and Rabbit, the Nerve goes, wâ€™ithout dividing, through the Sclcrotis and Choroides, and forms a sort of Cup, from

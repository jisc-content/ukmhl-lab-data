Nos magna ex parte latebat verum Naturae confilium, quae hocce organum tam curiofe fa«5lum ho- minibus multifque aliis animalibus tribuit, donec rem cbfcuram, plurimis inftitutis experimentis, ingeniofus Dr Goodwynus aggrediebatur. Ratiocinationem et fingula experimenta hic loci percurrere longum foret, quapropter conclufiones inde illatas, tantummodo fubjicere fas eft. “ i{i, The lungs contain 109 cubic inches of air af- ter a complete expiration ; and tliis quantity receives an addition of 14 cubic inches by infpiration. 2dly, The dilatation of the lungs after expiration is to their dilatation after infpiration, as 109 to 123. 3dly, The blood circulates through the pulmonary vef- fels in all the degrees of natural refpiration. 4thly, The circulation through them after expiration is fufficiently free to keep up the health of the fyftem. And hence it follows, that the dilatation of the hrngs is r.ot the final caufe of refpiration Sequentia' ad ufum eorum fpetfant. \ <1 A quantity of dephlogifticated air is feparated from the atmofpheric air m the lungs by refpiration, and a quantity of fixed air is added to it. 2dly, The dephlogifticated air exerts a Chemical aflion on the pulmonary blood, in confequence of which it ac- quires a florid colour. 2dly. In ordinary refpiration, this florid colour is feen diftintftly as the blood paifes into the left auride ; and the heart contrads then with its natural force and ire- quency. 4tPlj, When refpiration is obftrufled, the florid colour it

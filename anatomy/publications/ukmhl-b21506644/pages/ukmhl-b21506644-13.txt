PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION. These ' Landmarks ' have already appeared in Saint Bartholomew's Hospital Reports. They are now republished, with some additions, in the hope that they may be useful to others besides those for whom they were originally intended. My object has been to collect into a compact form the leading landmarks which help practical sur- geons in their daily work. Those relating to the chest and abdomen have been ascertained, with as much precision as natural variations permit, by needles introduced in various directions. I have to express my acknowledgments to Mr. Walsham and to Dr. Godson for their contributions. 65 Gower Street : March 1876.

44 LANDMARKS MEDICAL AND SURGICAL jejunum lie nearer to the umbilicus (one reason of the great fatality of umbilical hernise). Those of the ilium are lower down. 102. Bladder.—When the bladder distends, it gradually rises out of the pelvis into the abdomen, pushes the small intestines out of the way, and forms a swelling above the pubes, reaching in extreme cases to the navel. The outline of this swelling is perceptible to the hand as well as to per- cussion. More than this, fluctuation can be felt through the distended bladder by tapping on it in front with the fingers of one hand, while the forefinger of the other passed up the rectum feels the bottom of the ' trigone.' THE PERINEUM. The body is supposed to be placed in the usual position for lithotomy. 103. Bony framework.—We can readily feel the osseous and ligamentous boundaries of the perineum ; namely, the rami of the pubes and ischia, the tuberosities of the ischia, the great sacro-ischiatic ligaments, and the apex of the coccyx. This framework forms a lozenge-shaped space. If we draw an imaginary line across it from the front of one tuber ischii to the other, we divide this space into an anterior and a posterior triangle. The anterior is nearly equilateral, and, in a well-formed pelvis, its sides are from three to three and a half inches long. It is called the urethral triangle. The posterior, containing the greater part of the anus and the ischio-rectal fossa on each side, is called the anal triangle. 104. Baph<5.—A slight central ridge of skin, called the ' raphe,' runs from the anus up the perineum, scrotum, and penis. This ' raphe,' or middle line of the perineum, is the 'line of safety' in making incisions to let out matter or effused urine, or to divide a stricture. 105. Central point of perineum.—It is very important to know that a point of the raphe about midway between the scrotum (where it joins the perineum) and the centre of the anus, corresponds with the so-called ' central tendon ' where

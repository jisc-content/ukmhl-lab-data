THE FACE 7 from the meatus to the occipital protuberance corresponds with the lower level of the posterior lobe. The lower level of the cerebellum is covered by the muscles of the nape, and cannot be defined by external examination. It depends upon the extent to which the occipital fossae bulge into the nape of the neck ; and this bulge varies in different skulls. THE FACE. 15. The approaches to the organs of the senses, their ever- varying expression, their numerous muscles, and their rich profusion of vessels and nerves, give the face great anatomical importance, which has a most valuable bearing, not only on the practice of surgery, but on the physiognomy of health, and the diagnosis of disease. 16. Foramina for branches of fifth nerve—A surgeon may be called upon to divide any one of the three chief branches of the fifth nerve upon the face. He looks, therefore, with interest to the precise situations where they leave their bony foramina with their corresponding arteries. The supra- orbital notch or foramen can be felt about the junction of the inner with the middle third of the supraorbital margin. From this point a perpendicular line drawn with a slight inclination outwards, so as to cross the interval between the two bicuspid teeth in both jaws, passes over the infraorbital and the mental foramina. The direction of these two lower foramina looks towards the angle of the nose. 17. Pulley for superior oblique muscle.—By pressing the thumb beneath the internal angular process of the frontal bone, the cartilaginous pulley for the tendon of the superior oblique muscle can be distinctly felt. We should be careful not to interfere with this pulley in any operation about the orbit. 18. Lower Jaw The working of the condyle of the jaw vertically and from side to side can be distinctly felt and seen in front of the ear. When the mouth is opened wide, the condyle advances out of the glenoid cavity on to the eminentia

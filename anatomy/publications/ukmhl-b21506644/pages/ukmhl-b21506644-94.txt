NOTES. 1 Some pertinent remarks on this subject have been made by Mr. C. Heath in a pamphlet { On Anatomy in relation to Physic.' 2 In several adult normal skeletons measured in the Hunterian Museum, the average diameters of the upper opening of the chest were—antero-posterior, about z\ inches ; transverse, about 4^ inches. In the skeleton of O'Brien, the Irish giant, the antero-posterior diameter measures 4 inches, the transverse 6\. 3 Special experiments with reference to this point were made many years ago by the late Professor Quekett and Mr. Guthrie in the work-rooms of the College of Surgeons. 4 See a beautiful illustration of this in Sir C. Bell's 'Anatomy of Expression, p. 160. 5 See some good observations on the position of the enlarged spleen, by Sir W. Jenner, 'Brit. Med. Journ.,' Jan. 16, 1869.

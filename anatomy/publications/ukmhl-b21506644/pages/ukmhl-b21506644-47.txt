THE ABDOMEN 33 75. The sliding movement of the scapula on the chest can be adequately studied only on the living subject. It can move not only upwards and downwards as in shrugging the shoulders—backwards and forwards as in throwing back the shoulders—but it has a rotatory movement round a movable centre. This rotation is seen while the arm is being raised from the horizontal to the vertical position, and is effected by the co-operation of the trapezius with the serratus magnus. The glenoid cavity is thus made to look upwards, the inferior angle slides forwards, and is well held under the latissimus dorsi. 76. For the medical examination of the back, the patient should fold his arms across the chest; or he may sit with the arms hanging between his thighs, to lower the scapulae as much as possible. In this position the spine of the scapula corresponds (nearly) with the fissure between the upper and lower lobes of the lung; the apex of the lower lobe being about the level of the third rib. THE ABDOMEN. The student is assumed to be familiar with the conven- tional lines dividing the abdomen into regions. 77. Abdominal lines.—The linea alba, or central line of the abdomen, marks the union of the aponeuroses of the abdominal muscles. It runs from the apex of the ensiform cartilage to the symphysis pubis. As this line is the thinnest and least vascular part of the abdominal wall, we make our incision along it in ovariotomy, and in the high operation of lithotomy ; in it, we tap the abdomen in ascites, and the dis- tended bladder in retention of urine. The so-called ' linea semilunaris,' at the outer border of the sheath of the rectus, corresponds with a line, drawn slightly curved (with the concavity towards the linea alba), from the lowest part of the seventh rib to the spine of the pubes. This line would be in an adult about three inches from the umbi- licus ; but in an abdomen distended by dropsy or other cause the distance is increased in proportion. D

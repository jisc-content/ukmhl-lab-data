47 THE THIGH within the rectum. The largest fold projects from the side, and sometimes from the upper part of the rectum, near the prostate. When thickened or ulcerated, this fold occasions great pain in defalcation ; and great relief is afforded by its division.7 g. Lastly, the finger can examine the condition of the spaces filled with fat on either side of the rectum, called the ischio-rectal fossae, with a view to ascertain the existence of deep-seated collections of matter, or the internal communica- tions of fistulse. 109. Introduction of catheters—In the introduction of catheters the following are good rules. Keep the point of the instrument well applied all along against the upper sur- face of the urethra ;—depress the handle at the right moment (106);—keep the umbilicus in view ;—in cases of difficulty feel the urethra through the rectum, to ascertain whether the in- strument be in the right direction. Attention to these rules diminishes the risk of making a false passage, an injury which under great delicacy in manipulation ought never to happen. 110. Urethra in the child.—In children the membranous part of the urethra is, relatively, very long, owing to the small- ness of the prostate. It is also more sharply curved, because the bladder in children is more in the abdomen than in the pelvis. It is, moreover, composed of thin and delicate walls. The greatest gentleness, therefore, should be used in passing a catheter in childhood ; else the instrument is likely to pass through the coats and make a false passage. Hence the ad- vantage of being able to ascertain through the rectum whether the instrument be in the right track and moving freely in the bladder, which can also be easily felt in children.

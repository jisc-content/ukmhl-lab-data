2 I THE CHEST the head inclined towards the side on which pressure is made. It is worth remembering that the outer border of the sterno-mastoid corresponds pretty nearly with the outer edge of the scalenus anticus, which is the surgical guide to the subclavian artery. The phrenic nerve can be galvanised as it runs over the scalenus anticus. One pole of the battery should be placed in the fossa, the other over the diaphragm. By press- ing deeply at the upper part of the supra-clavicular fossa, the transverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra can be distinctly felt. This has been mistaken for an exostosis. In long and thin necks a thin cord is perceptible, running nearly parallel with and just above the clavicle. It is the posterior belly of the omo-hyoideus. See it rising and falling in breathing, and making tense during inspiration that part of the cervical fascia which lies over the cervical portion of the lung. Thus it may be said to be in all respects a muscle of inspiration, co-operating with the sterno-mastoid and scaleni. In the language of transcendental anatomy, we may say that the central tendon of the omo-hyoid represents a rudimentary cervical rib. Its posterior belly is analogous to a serration of the serratus magnus ; its anterior belly to a sterno-hyoid. THE CHEST. 47. As a rule, the right half of the chest is slightly larger than the left. Of ninety-two persons of the male sex and good constitutions, seventy-one had the right side the larger ; eleven the left; ten had both sides equal. The maximum of difference in favour of the right was one inch and a quarter. The measurements were made on a plane with the nipple. 48. Peculiarities in the female.—The chest of the female differs from that of the male in the following points :— Its general capacity is less ; the sternum is shorter ; the upper opening is larger in proportion to the lower; the upper ribs are more moveable, and therefore permit a greater enlarge-

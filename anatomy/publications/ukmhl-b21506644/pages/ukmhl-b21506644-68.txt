54 LANDMARKS MEDICAL AND SURGICAL with the middle third of this line lies over the artery as it emerges from the upper border of the great ischiatic notch. The point of exit of the ischiatic artery from the pelvis is about half an inch lower than that of the gluteal. 128. Pudic artery.â€”The pudic artery crosses the spine of the ischium outside the pelvis. To find it, draw a line from the outer side of the tuber ischii to the posterior superior spine of the ilium. The junction of the lower with the middle third gives the position of the artery. The ischiatic artery lies close to it, but nearer the middle line. Looking at the course of these arteries it appears that when we sit on hard seats the pressure is sustained by the bones ; when we recline on soft seats the pressure is sustained more by the soft parts, and reaches the arteries ; hence the tendency of modern modes of reposing to drive the blood into the interior of the pelvis and favour the production of piles and uterine disorders. A celebrated French accoucheur used to say that the fashion of high waists, tight lacing, and easy chairs brought him many thousands a year. THE KNEE. 129. Bony landmarks.-The patella ; the tuberosities of the two condyles ; the tubercle of the tibia for the attachment of the ligamentum patellae ; another (the lateral) tubercle, on the outer side of the head of the tibia ; the internal tuberosity of the tibia and the head of the fibula are the chief bony land- marks of the knee. Observe that the head of the fibula lies at the outer and back part of the tibia, and that it is pretty nearly on a level with the tubercle for the attachment of the ligamentum patellae. In thin persons we can feel the adductor tubercle or spur- like projection of bone above the internal condyle which gives attachment to the tendon of the adductor magnus. This spur-like projection corresponds with the level of the epiphy- sis of the lower end of the femur, and also with the level oi

73 THE HAND THE HAND. 177. It is beside the purpose here to examine the question whether the hand can tell more than the arm, the leg, or any- other part of the body, about the physical constitution of its owner, and to what use it has been put. Those who are interested in this subject should read a very elaborate treatise by Cams,12 ' On the Reason and Meaning of the Different Forms of the Hand.' Still less would I indulge curiosity by inquiring whether the professors of chiromancy, relying on the text ' erit signum in manu tua et quasi monumentum ante oculos tuos,' can advance any reasonable pretensions for their assertion that they can read in the furrows of the palm the future destiny of its master. 178. Furrow in palm.—The only furrow in the palm useful as a surgical landmark is that which runs transversely across its lower third, and is well seen when the fingers are slightly bent. This transverse furrow corresponds pretty nearly with the'metacarpal joints of the fingers, with the upper limit of the synovial sheaths of the flexor tendons of the fingers (that of the little finger excepted (172); also with the splitting of the palmar fascia into its four slips. The transverse metacarpal ligament lies in the same line with it. Again, a little below this furrow, the digital arteries bifurcate to run along the opposite sides of the fingers. 179. Interdigital folds.—By separating the fingers and pressing upon the interdigital folds of skin, we can feel the transverse ligament of the fingers, which prevents their too wide separation. The skin of these folds is much thinner on the dorsal than the palmar aspect; hence deep-seated ab- scesses in the palm very frequently burst on the back of the hand. 180. Digital furrows.—Concerning the transverse furrows on the palmar surface of the fingers, notice that the first furrows, close to the palm, do not correspond with the meta- carpal joints. The second and third furrows do correspond with their respective joints.

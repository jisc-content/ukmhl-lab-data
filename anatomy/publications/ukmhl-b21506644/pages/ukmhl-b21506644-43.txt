THE BACK 29 cumbent pressure is likely to give rise to displacements and congestions which sooner or later engender very grievous ailments, especially their own. To the legitimate use of stays of proper make and ma- terial, there can be no objection. A reasonable degree of support round the waist, which is the weakest part of the back, must be comfortable and desirable. But such support should not constrain its natural shape and elasticity. In the Medicean Venus, 'the bending statue which enchants the world,' the waist forms a graceful oval of nearly 27 inches in circumference. To attempt to reduce this to an ungraceful circle of 22, 20, or even 18 inches in circumference is surely to disfigure the person and aggravate the difficulties of the stomach. What wonder then if the pernicious habit of tight lacing gives rise to endless troubles of indigestion, and to the uterine and other complaints so common in women ? THE BACK. 63. Median furrow.—In a muscular man, a furrow, caused by the prominence of the erector spinae on each side, runs down the middle of the back. The lower end of the furrow corresponds with the interval between the spine of the last lumbar and that of the first sacral vertebra. 64. Spines of vertebrae.—A little friction with the fin- gers down the backbone will cause the spines of the vertebrae to be tipped with red, so that they can be easily counted, and any deviation from the straight line detected. Still it is worth remembering that the spine of the third dorsal is on a level with the commencement of the spine of the scapula— that the spine of the seventh dorsal is on a level with the inferior angle of the scapula—that the spine of the last dorsal is on a level with the head of the last rib. 65. Division of the trachea.—The division of the trachea is opposite the spine of the third, in some cases the fourth, dorsal vertebra. In front this division is on the level of the junction of the first with the second bone of the sternum,

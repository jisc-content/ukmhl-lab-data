77 EXAMINATION PER VAGINAM ' By semi-rotatory movement, and alternately flexing and extending the fingers, the hand can gradually be insinuated into the commencement ot the sigmoid flexure. In the sigmoid flexure the fingers can explore the whole of the lower part of the abdomen, the loose attachment of this por- tion of the gut permitting the hand to travel freely over the iliac and hypogastric regions. • The parts that can here be felt are the bifurcation of the aorta, the division of the common iliac arteries, the iliac fossa, and the crest of the ilium. ' In the female, the uterus in the middle line, and the ovaries on either side, can be readily distinguished. 'In the introduction of the hand into the rectum, in a patient under chloroform, the dilatation of the sphincter ani should be very gradual: first two fingers, then four, and finally the thumb should be passed. It is necessary to use considerable force, and unless care be taken, not only the integumentary edge of the anus, but the sphincter itself, may be lacerated. The introduction is facilitated by the application of the other hand upon the abdomen. ' When the dilatation has been gradual and the hand not too large, no incontinence of faeces and no very considerable amount of pain has resulted.'13 We have been informed on reliable authority that per- manent incontinence of faeces has occasionally followed these examinations. Lastly, we think it right to insist upon the important fact that, in some subjects, even a small hand cannot be passed up the rectum beyond the reflection of the peritoneum over the second part of the gut. In such instances the peritoneum offers a resistance like a tight garter, and prevents the farther advance of the hand without great risk of laceration of the parts. EXAMINATION PER VAGINAM.

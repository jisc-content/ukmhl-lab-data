LANDMARKS MEDICAL AND SURGICAL. I. In clinical teaching, we have daily occasions to point out, on the surface of the living body, what may be called ' medical and surgical landmarks.' By ' landmarks ' we mean lines, bony eminences, furrows, depressions, and such like, which are guides to, or indications of, deeper-seated parts. This practice is not only most useful but absolutely neces- sary ; because many, even advanced students of anatomy are not so ready as they ought to be in their recognition of parts when covered by skin. Students who may be familiar enough with bones, muscles, blood-vessels, or viscera in the dissected subject, are often sadly at fault when they come to put this knowledge into practice in the living. For instance, ask a student to put his finger on the exact spot where he would feel for the head of the radius, the coracoid process of the scapula, the tubercle of the scaphoid bone in the foot; ask him to compress effectually one of the main arteries ; to chalk the line of its course; to map on the chest the position of the heart and the several valves at its base ; to trace along the walls of the chest the outlines of the lungs and pleura; to point out the bony prominences about the joints, and their relative position in the different motions of the joints; test him about the muscles and tendons which can be seen or felt as they stand out in relief or remain in repose; let him introduce his finger into the several orifices of the body, and say what parts are accessible to the touch :â€” questions such as these even a good anatomist, unaccus- B

52 LANDMARKS MEDICAL AND SURGICAL a hand's breadth below Poupart's ligament, and be continued for three inches in the line of the artery. To command the femoral in Scarpa's triangle the pad of the tourniquet should be placed at the apex, and the direction of the pressure should be, not backwards, but outwards, so that the artery may be compressed against the femur. In the middle third of the thigh the femoral artery lies in Hunter's canal, overlapped by the sartorius. About the commencement of the lower third the artery leaves the canal through the oval opening in the adductor magnus, and, under the name of popliteal, enters the popliteal space. The line for finding the artery in Hunter's canal has been already traced. The incision to reach the artery in this part of its course would fall in with the outer border of the sartorius. To command the femoral artery in Hunter's canal, the pressure should be directed outwardly, so as to press the vessel against the bone. 123. Line of the anterior crural nerve.—This nerve enters the thigh beneath the crural arch about midway between the anterior superior spine of the ilium and the spine of the pubes. It lies about half an inch to the outer side of the femoral artery and immediately divides into its numerous bfcLTlcllCS. 124. Line of the great ischiatic nerve.—The track of this nerve corresponds with a line drawn from a point about midway between the great trochanter and the tuber ischn (a trifle nearer to the latter) down to the middle of the popliteal space The most superficial part of the nerve is just below the fold of the buttock. An incision here would find it on the outer side of the biceps. Lower down it lies to the inner side of the muscle. THE BUTTOCKS. I25 Buttocks. Bony landmarks.-The bony land- marks of the buttocks which can be distinctly felt are: I, the posterior superior spines of the ilia ; 2, the spines of the sacral vertebra, ; 3. the two tubercles of the last sacral vcr- J

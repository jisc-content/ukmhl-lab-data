THE FOREARM AND WRIST 69 canal which, in many mammalia, transmits the median nerve and ulnar artery. A third origin of the pronator teres is always attached to it; this origin covers the brachial artery.11 165. Bursae.—The subcutaneous bursa over the olecranon, if distended, would be as large as a walnut. A second bursa sometimes exists a little lower down upon the ulna. There is also a small subcutaneous bursa over each of the condyles. The vertical extent of the elbow joint is limited, above by a line drawn from one condyle to the other ; below, by a line corresponding to the lowest part of the head of the radius. 166. Interosseous arteries.—About one inch below the head of the radius, the ulnar artery gives off the common interosseous ; and this divides, about half an inch lower, into the anterior and posterior interosseous. Thus, in amputating the forearm, say two inches below the head of the radius, four arteries at least would require ligature. By flexion of the elbow to the utmost, the circulation through the brachial artery can be arrested ; but the position is painful, and can be tolerated only for a short time. 167. Lymphatic gland.—There is a small lymphatic gland just above the inner condyle, in front of the intermuscu- lar septum. It is the first to take alarm in poisoned wounds of the hand. THE FOREARM AND WRIST. 168. ulna.—The edge of the ulna can be felt subcutaneous from the olecranon to the styloid process (in supination). Any irregularity could be easily detected. The styloid pro- cess of the ulna does not descend so low as the styloid process of the radius, or it would impede the free abduction of the hand. Its apex is on a level with the radio-carpal joint The head of the ulna is plainly felt and seen projecting at the back of the wrist, especially in pronation of the forearm. It then lies between the tendons of the extensor carpi ulnaris and extensor minimi digiti. There is often a subcutaneous bursa over it.

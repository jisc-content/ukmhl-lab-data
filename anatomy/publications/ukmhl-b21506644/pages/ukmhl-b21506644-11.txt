PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION. In the present Edition the author adheres to his decision not to introduce Diagrams. Experience more than ever convinces him that they would frustrate his main object, which is to urge Students to get the habit of making the eye and the hand work together, and to educate the ' touch' upon the normal living body. Without such practical training, how can we reasonably expect to form a correct diagnosis when called upon to examine an injury or to detect a disease? In truth, this work is * intended only for those who are desirous of acquiring the habit recom- mended. The author gladly expresses his obligation to his friend Mr. Anthony A. Bowlby, F.R.C.S., the Surgical Registrar of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, for many useful suggestions, and for some additional ' Landmarks' concerning the principal nerve trunks of the limbs. London : June 1888.

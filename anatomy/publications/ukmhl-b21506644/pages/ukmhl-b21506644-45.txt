3i THE BACK tally with their corresponding ribs. All this, however, is best seen in the skeleton. 71. The spines of the vertebrae may be useful as land- marks indicative of the levels of important organs. I have therefore arranged them in a tabular form thus :— Tabular Plan of Parts opposite the Spines of the V ERTEBRjE. <• CJ I—< > 4 Pi w U 5th. Cricoid cartilage. (Esophagus begins. 7 th.

Orig-ins of the spinal nerves—It is useful to know opposite what vertebrae the spinal nerves in the different regions arise from the spinal cord. They arise as follows :— The origins of the eight cervical nerves correspond to the interval between the occiput and the sixth cervical spine The origins of the first six dorsal nerves correspond to the interval between the sixth cervical and the fourth dorsal spines.

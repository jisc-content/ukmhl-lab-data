75 PALPATION BY THE RECTUM The extensor tendon of the last joint of the thumb crosses the apex of the first interosseous space. Under the tendon, and in the angle between the bones, we feel the radial artery just before it sinks into the palm. 185. Subcutaneous veins.—The veins on the back of the hand, and their arrangement in the form of arches which receive the digital veins, is sufficiently obvious. The number and arrangement of the arches may vary, but in all hands it is interesting to notice that the veins from the fingers run up between the knuckles and are out of harm's way. 186. Interosseous arteries.—Since the dorsal interos- seous arteries, like the palmar, run along the interosseous spaces, incisions to let out pus should always be made over the backs of the metacarpal bones. 187. Oig-ital bursae.—Small subcutaneous bursas are sometimes developed over the knuckles and the backs of the joints of the fingers. They often become enlarged and un- seemly in persons of a rheumatic or gouty tendency. 188. Knuckles and dig-ital joints.—The three rows of projections called ' the knuckles ' are formed by the proximal bones of the several joints : thus the first row is formed by the ends of the metacarpals ; the second by the ends of the first phalanges, and so forth. In amputations of the fingers it is well to remember that in all cases the line of the joints is a little in advance of the knuckles, that is, nearer the end of the fingers. Long and graceful fingers, coupled with thickness and breadth of the sentient pulp at their ends, and too great arching of the nails, have been regarded, ever since the days of Hippocrates, as not unlikely indications of a tendency to pulmonary disease. PALPATION BY THE RECTUM. The following report is from Mr. Walsham, of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, who, having a small hand (some- what less than seven and a half inches round), has had oppor-

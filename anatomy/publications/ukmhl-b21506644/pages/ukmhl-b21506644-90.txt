76 LANDMARKS MEDICAL AND SURGICAL tunities of introducing it up the rectum, in the living subject, for the purpose of diagnosis :— ' It is possible to introduce the hand (if small) into the rectum ; in many cases into the sigmoid flexure, and in rare instances into the descending colon. ' Once beyond the sphincter, the hand enters a capacious sac, and the following important parts can be felt through its walls :— ' Through the anterior wall the hand first recognises the prostate, which feels like a moderately large chestnut. Im- mediately behind the prostate, the vesiculse seminales may be distinguished as two softish masses situated one on either side of the middle line. Internal to them, the whipcord-like feel of the vasa deferentia can be readily traced over the bladder to the sides of the pelvis. ' The bladder is easily recognised, when moderately dis- tended, as a soft fluctuating tumour behind the prostate ; when empty it cannot be distinguished from the intestines, which then descend between the rectum and the pubes. The arch of the pubes can well be defined when the bladder is empty. ' Through the posterior wall of the bowel the coccyx and sacrum can be felt, the curve of the sacrum being readily followed by the hand. ' The projecting spine of the ischium on each side of the pelvis is a valuable landmark. From this point the outlines of the greater and lesser sacro-ischiatic foramina can be traced by the fingers ; and any new growth, encroaching on the pelvic cavity through these apertures, could be easily detected. ' If the hand be now pushed farther up the gut, the pro- montory of the sacrum is reached ; the pulsation of the iliac vessels becomes manifest, and the course of the external iliac can be traced along the brim of the pelvis to the crural arch, the loose attachments of the rectum permitting very free movement in this direction. The internal iliac artery can also be followed to the upper part of the great sacro-ischiatic foramen.

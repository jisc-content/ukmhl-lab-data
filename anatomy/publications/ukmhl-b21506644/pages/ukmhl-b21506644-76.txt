62 LANDMARKS MEDICAL AND SURGICAL of the first metatarsal bone ; 7, the sesamoid bones of the great toe. Along the outer side of the foot we can feel—1, the external tuberosity of the os calcis ; 2, the external mal- leolus ; 3, the peroneal tubercle of the os calcis, one inch below the malleolus, with the long peroneal tendon below it, and the short one above it; 4. the projection of the base of the fifth metatarsal bone. 149. lanes of joints.-In fat persons the following rules for finding the joints may be of service as regards the surgery of the foot:— The level of the ankle joint lies about half an inch above the end of the inner malleolus. This is worth remembering in performing ' Syme's ' amputation. The tubercle of the scaphoid bone is the best guide to the astragalo-scaphoid joint which lies immediately behind it; and the plane of this joint is in the same line as that of the calcaneo-cuboid. Thus a line drawn transversely over the dorsum of the foot, behind the tubercle of the scaphoid, would strike both the joints opened in ' Chopart's ' opera- tion Place your thumb on the tubercle of the scaphoid, and measure about one inch and a half in front: here you find the joint between the internal cuneiform bone and the meta- tarsal bone of the great toe. This point is useful in Lisfranc s operation, which consists in the removal of the metatarsal b01The line of the calcaneo-cuboid joint lies midway between the external malleolus and the (tarsal) end of the metatarsal bone of the little toe. . The projection of the fifth metatarsal bone is the guide to the ioint between it and the cuboid. Notice that the line of the joints between the metatarsal bones and the first phalanges lies a full inch farther back than the interdigital folds of the skin. This is a point to be remembered in amputating the toes. ,50. Dorsa. ar.ery.-The line of the dorsal artery of the foot is from the middle of the ankle to the interval between

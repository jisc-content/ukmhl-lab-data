TARSAL ARTICULATIONS. 175 Bones one with another.—The astragalus is connected with the calcaneum by two synovial articulations, viz., by a posterior one pecu- liar to those two bones, and by an anterior one common to them with the scaphoid bone. The following are the principal parts requiring ClC Astragalo-calcaneal ligaments.—The interosseous ligament, broad and strong, passes vertically downwards from the groove between the anterior and posterior articular surfaces of the astragalus to the similar groove between the corresponding articular surfaces of the calcaneum. A membranous posterior ligament connects the posterior border of the astragalus with the upper surface of the calcaneum ; its Abies are oblique and very short. There is also an external ligament, consisting of a slight fasciculus of fibres, which descends perpendicularly from the outer surface of the astragalus to the outer side of the calcaneum, parallel with the middle division of the external lateral ligament of the ankle-joint. It may be further observed, that those portions of the lateral ligaments of the ankle-joint which pass down over the astragalus to the os" calcis assist in uniting these two bones. Fig. 157.

Calcaneo-scaphoid ligaments. — The calcaneum and scaphoid bone are not in contact, but they are connected by two ligaments. The inferior or plantar liga- ment, much the larger of the two, is a broad band which passes for- : wards and inwards from the fore part of the calcaneum (susten- ! taculum tali) to the inferior surface of the scaphoid bone. It is in I contact inferiorly with the tendon of the tibialis posticus muscle, while superiorly it forms the floor of the articular cavity which receives the head of the astragalus, and is lined by synovial membrane. The ! external, dorsal, or interosseous ligament, forms the external boundary

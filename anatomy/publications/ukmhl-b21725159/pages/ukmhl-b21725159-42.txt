VERTEBRAL COLUMN. 22 ciicR vertebra,, epiphysial plates are formed after puberty, as in other vertebra;, and two Hat irregular plates of bone are added to each lateral surface of the sacrum, the uppeimost of which extends over the sides of the first two or three, while the lower connects the remaining two. These appear from the 18th to the 20th year, and are united about the 25th. The bodies of the sacral vertebra; are at first separated by intervertebral plates, but about the 18th year, in the case of the lower vertebra;, ossification begins to extend through these plates and the epiphyses, so as completely to unite the adjacent bodies. The ossific union of the first and second bodies does not take place till the 25th year or later Previous to this, the lateral masses have coalesced nearly in the same order as the bodies. The deficiency of the spine and dorsal part of the lamina; usually existing in the fifth sacral vertebra, and not unfrequently extending to the fourth, but more rarely to the third, may be attributed in part to the non-extension of ossification in that direction : but such varieties of foim, like many others to which the sacral vertebrae are subject, are probably intimately connected with the nature and development of the formative matrix of the bones. The more completely open state of the sacral canal posteriorly found in cases of spina-bifida is un- doubtedly connected with early morbid changes interfering with the natural process of development. Coccygeal Vertebrae.—Each of the coccygeal vertebrae is ossified from a distinct piece of cartilage, and usually from a single centre, but in the upper sometimes from two centres. Ossification commences in the first generally about the time of birth; in the second, from the 5th to the 10th year; in the third, some time before, and in the fourth, some time after puberty. The ossific union of the three lower coccygeal vertebrae occurs before middle life; their union with the first, and the union of this with the sacrum, belong to the later periods of life. GENERAL AND SERIAL HOMOLOGY OF THE VERTEBR2E, The study of the various forms presented by the parts of the vertebral column, and of its relation to the rest of the skeleton in man and animals, as also of its development in the foetus, has led to the formation of the general views of homology referred to in the introduction. These views originated, in somewhat different forms, mainly with Oken, Cains, Geoffroy St. Hilaire, and Owen ; and, with various modifications and extensions by more recent writers, as Goodsir, Huxley, Gegenbaur, St. George Mivart, and Plower, are now admitted by almost all anatomists, in some shape or other, as the basis of a morphological Fig. 21.—Views op the Different Vertebrae from above to illustrate their Homologies.

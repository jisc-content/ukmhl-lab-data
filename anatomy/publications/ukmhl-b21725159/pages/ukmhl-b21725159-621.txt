NERVES OF THE GROIN. G01 off an inguinal branch, having a similar course and distribution to the ilio-inguinal nerve, the place of which it supplies. Genito-crural nerve. The genito-crural nerve belongs partly to the external genital organs and partly to the thigh. It is derived chiefly from the Fig. 367.

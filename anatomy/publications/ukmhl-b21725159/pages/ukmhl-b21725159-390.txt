370 ARTERIES OF THE HEAD AND NECK. To facilitate the arrangement of its numerous branches, this arterv may be considered in three parts, viz.: I, the part between the jaw and internal lateral ligament; 2, the part in contact with the external pterygoid muscle ; and, 3, the part in the spheno-maxillary fossa. A. Branches of the first part.—The branches of the first part of the artery all pass through the bony foramina. J ('0 The tympanic branch, of small size and variable in origin, passes deeply behind the articulation of the lower jaw, and enters the fissure of Glaser, sup- plying the laxator tympani muscle, and the tympanic cavity, where it ramifies Fig. 251. Fig. 251.—Deep Dissection of the Head and Face, to snow the Internal Maxillary Artery and its Branches (from Tiedemann). i The right half of the calvarium, the zygomatic arch, and the upper half of the ramus ■of the lower jaw, with the external pterygoid muscle, have been removed ; some of the superficial muscles of the face have been divided, and the internal pterygoid and buccinator muscles are exposed : 1, facial artery, rising over the edge of the lower jaw ; 2, inferior labial branches ; 2', deep mental branch of the inferior dental artery; 3, facial artery continued ; 4, superior coronary of the facial ; 5, lateral nasal; 6, frontal branch of the ophthalmic artery, giving descending twigs to communicate with the angular branch of the facial and with the dorsal nasal ; 7, internal carotid artery ; 8, external carotid artery at the place where it passes through the parotid gland, which has been removed ; 9, division of the external carotid artery into superficial, temporal and internal maxillary arteries ; 10, superficial temporal ; 11, masseteric branch of the external carotid artery ; 12, the trunk of the internal maxillary artery, at the origin of its inferior dental branch ; 13, on the root of the zygoma, points to the middle meningeal branch, and on the dura mater above, to its distribution ; 14, on the lower part of the temporal muscle separated from the eoronoid process of the jaw, is between the deep temporal branches of the artery; 15, pterygoid branches; 1(1, buccal artery ; 17, posterior superior dental, and deepest part of the internal maxillary artery where it enters the spheno-maxillary fossa ; 18, branches of the infraorbital artery issuing upon the face.

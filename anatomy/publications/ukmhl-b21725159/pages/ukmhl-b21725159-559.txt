539 THE SUPERIOR MAXILLARY NERVE. V Anterior dental branch.—The anterior dental branch, leaving the trank of the nerve at a varying distance behind its exit from the infra- orbital foramen, enters a special canal in front of the antrum of High- more. In this canal it receives the communicating filament from the posterior dental nerve, and divides into two branches, which furnish offsets for the front teeth. (r?) The inner branch supplies the incisor and canine teeth. Filaments from this nerve enter the lower meatus of the nose, and end in the membrane covering’ the lower spongy bone. Also above the root of the canine tooth, it unites with a branch of the posterior nasal nerve from Meckel's ganglion, and forms with it a small thickening, the ganglion of liochduleh, from which branches are described as descending to the alveolar process and gums of the incisor and canine teeth. (See Hyrtl’s Lehrbuch, p. 804.) It is probable, however, that this enlargement contains no nerve cells, and is a minute plexus rather than an actual ganglion. (b) The outer branch gives filaments to the bicuspid teeth, and is connected with the posterior dental nerve. Infraorbital branches. — The infraorbital branches, large and numerous, spring from the end of the superior maxillary nerve beneath the elevator muscle of the upper lip, and are divisible into palpebral, nasal, and labial sets.

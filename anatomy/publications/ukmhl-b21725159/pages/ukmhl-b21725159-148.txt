MORPHOLOGY OF THE BONES OF TIIE LIMBS. 12S to exist, interposed between the liones of the proximal and distal rows, and more immediately between the scaphoid and lunar and the trapezium and trapezoid. is rone is termed the os ccntralc, and several circumstances appear to indicate that it most frequently corresponds to a part of one of the proximal bones. In the carnivora and some other mammals, the scaphoid and lunar are united in the adult into one bone, the scapho-lunar, and Flower has observed, that in the young- dog there is frequently, but not invariably, a separate ossification in the distal part of the scapho-lunar corresponding- in position and relations with the os centrale of other animals (Flower, Journ. of Anat., vol. iv., 1870); and a similar Fig- 114- Fig. 115.

But in both of these animals in the adult this piece of bone has become com- pletely ossified, so as to form one with the scapho-lunar. It seems probable that in some animals a central bone may be deiived from the separation of the proximal part of the os magnum. The determination of the homology of the navicular bone of the tarsus is not yet fully made out, but it seems most probable that this bone corresponds not to any single or entire bone of the carpus, but rather to the os ccntralc, together with a detached portion of the scaphoid. In some animals there is a tenth separate bone of the carpus, which seems most nearly to correspond to the tuberosity of the scaphoid : this constitutes the typical radial sesamoid of Gegenbaur. and the navicular- bone of the tarsus may per- haps correspond to this along with the os centrale. It is interesting to remark that this bone is sometimes found separate in the hiunan hand. (See W. Gruber, Struthers, Turner, and others, in Journ. of Anat., and Mivart " On the Ap- pendicular Skeleton of the Primates” in Philos. Trans. 1867.) The'as- Calais is generally believed to correspond most nearly with the cuneiform of the carpus, and by some it has been held to include the pisiform,—a view not participated in by Gegenbaur, but of the truth of which any one will be convinced by the inspection of the hand and foot of the bear. It is deserving of remark that in the young of that animal, the much enlarged pisiform possesses an epiphysis of its own, exactly similar to the one known as existing on the tuberosity of the calcaneunr,—a fact observable also in other animals, and which of itself refutes the view taken by some that the pisiform corresponds to the epiphysis of the calcaneal tuberosity. (Allen Thomson.) The following tables present a synoptical view of the corresponding or homo- logous bones or other parts in the thoracic and pelvic limbs.

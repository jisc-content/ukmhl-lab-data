A considerable number of new figures have been introduced into the present Edition, some having been substituted for former ones now withdrawn, others added as new illustrations. They are partly from original drawings, and partly electrotype copies of figures in other published works, for their courtesy in allowing copies of which the Editors have to thank the respective Authors and Publishers. In the seventh Edition a large number of new figures were intro- duced, of which the originals were drawn by Dr. Allen Thomson, and by Mr. R. Tennant under his superintendence, and the engrav- ing was executed by Mr. Stephen Miller of Glasgow. To these only a few have been added in the first volume of the present Edi- tion. But in the General Anatomy and other parts of the Second Volume of the present Edition a considerable number of new figures have been added, the original drawings for which have been executed chiefly 1)}' Mr. Schafer and Mr. Wesley, and the engravings by Mr. Pearson. The Table of Contents and the Index, with the accompanying explanation of the derivation of terms, have been compiled by Dr. Alexander Henry. October, 1875.

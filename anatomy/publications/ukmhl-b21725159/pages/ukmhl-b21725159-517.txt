497 TIIE POPLITEAL VEIN. The popliteal vein, thus formed, receives smaller branches corre- sponding with the articular and muscular arteries, and the larger branch named the external saphenous vein. In its course through the ham the popliteal vein is placed at first internally to the popliteal artery, then behind, and lastly to the outer side of it, but always pos- teriorly and between it and the nerve. Thus situated, it passes up through the aperture in the adductor magnus, and becomes continuous with the femoral vein. Varieties.—'The union of the veins which form the popliteal is often farther up than usual, and the lower part of the artery is accompanied by two veins. This arrangement in some rare cases extends to the entire length or the aitciy. Fig. 316. FiS- 317- Fig. 316.—Outline of the Posterior or Short Saphenous Vein. The vein, commencing on the dorsum and outside of the foot, is seen to pass up behind the outer ankle and to dip beneath the fascia in the popliteal space. Fig. 317.—View of the Veins of the Groin and neighbouring parts (from R. Quain). ^ The full description of this figure will be found at p. 455. The following numbers indicate the veins :—2, the femoral vein ; 3, the large or internal saphenous vein ; 3', anterior saphenous ; 4, superficial circumflex veins with twigs to the inguinal glands ; 5, superficial epigastric ; 6, superficial pudic. The femoral vein extends, like the artery which it accompanies, through the upper two-thirds of the thigh, and terminates at Poupart’s ligament in the external iliac vein. Placed at first outside the artery, it gradually inclines inwards behind it; and ou reaching Poupart’s ligament, lies on the inner side, on the same plane with the artery, and separated from it only by a slight partition of the membranous sheath,

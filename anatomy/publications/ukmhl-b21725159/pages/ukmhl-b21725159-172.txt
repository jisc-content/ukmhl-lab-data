THE ELBOW-JOINT. The lower extremity of the humerus is in contact with the ulna P? h\ M and radius at the elbow, and forms with them a hinge-joint. W The greater sigmoid cavity of the ulna arti- culates with the troch- lea of the humerus, so as to admit of flexion and extension only; while the cup-shaped depression on the head cf the radius is fitted to turn freely on the rounded capitulum. These bones are united principally by lateral ligaments. The internal lateral ligament, composed of diverging and radiat- ing fibres, is divisible into an anterior and a posterior part. The anterior part radiates from the front of the internal condylar eminence of the humerus, and is inserted into the coronoid process, along the inner margin of the sigmoid cavity. The posterior part, of the same triangular form, passes from the under and back part of the condylar eminence downwards to the inner border of the olecranon ; and some fibres are connected with a small transverse band, which passes over the notch between the olecranon and the coronoid process. The external lateral ligament, intimately connected with the tendinous attachment of the extensor muscles, is shorter and much

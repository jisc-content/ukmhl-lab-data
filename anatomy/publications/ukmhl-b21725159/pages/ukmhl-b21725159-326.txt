MUSCLES OF THE THORAX. 306 muscles op the thorax. The muscles of the thoracic wall are the intercostales, levatores cos- tarum, subcostales, and triangularis sterni, and along with these the diaphragm intervening between the thorax and abdomen may con veniently be grouped. J The intercostal muscles consist of two thin layers of oblique short muscular fibres filling up the intercostal spaces : these layers are named respectively the external and internal muscles. Fig. 219. Fig. 219.—View op several op the Middle Dorsal Vertebr.® and Ribs, to show the Intercostal Muscles (after Cloquet). (A. T.) ^ A, from tlie side ; B, from behind. IV, the fourth dorsal vertebra ; V, V, the fifth rib and its cartilage ; 1, 1, the levatores costarum muscles, short and long ; 2, the external intercostal muscles ; 3, the internal intercostal layer shown, in the lower of the two spaces represented, by the removal of the external layer, and seen in A in the upper space, in front of the external layer: the deficiency of the internal layer towards the vertebral column is shown in B. The external intercostal muscles, consisting of muscular with some tendinous fibres intermixed, are directed obliquely downwards and forwards from one rib to another. Their extent for the most part is from the tubercles of the ribs, nearly to the outer end of the cartilages ; but in the two lowest intervals they reach forwards to the ends of the spaces. Thin tendinous fibres, having the same direction as the external intercostal muscles, are continued forwards between the costal cartilages, from the points where the muscles cease, to the sternum, and there cover the internal intercostals. The internal intercostal muscles, placed deeper than the preceding, are attached to the inner margins of the ribs and their cartilages.

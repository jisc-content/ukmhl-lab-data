96 BONES OF THE UPPER LIMB. Fig. 83. Fig. 83.—Ossification of the Clavicle nucleus for the body appears a little behind the glenoid cavity about the 7th or Sth week. Around this centre is fonned a triangular plate of bone, from near the upper margin of which about the 3rd month the spine appears as a slight ridge. At birth the coracoid and acromion process, the base and inferior angle, the edges of the spine and of the glenoid cavity are cartilaginous. The nucleus of the coracoid process is especially worthy of attention, both because it appears in the first year, while the other supplementary nuclei are fonned only after pu- berty, and because, although reduced to a mere epiphysis in mammals, it forms a distinct and sometimes large bone in other vertebrate animals. The coracoid process is united to the body about the age of puberty. The acromion process is cartilaginous till the 14th or 16th year, when two distinct nuclei appear. These soon coalesce and fonn an epiphysis which is united to the spine from the 22nd to the 25th year. The cartilage of the base, which it may be noticed conesponds Fig. 82.

The epiphysis thus fonned, together with an epiphysial lamina which occasionally forms the border of the glenoid cavity, are imited to the body about the 25th year. (R.

The clavicle begins to ossify before any other bone in the body. Its ossifica- tion commences before the deposition of cartilage in connection with it, but afterwards progresses in cartilage as well as in fibrous substance. It is formed

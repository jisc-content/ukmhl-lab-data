220 MUSCLES OF TIIE UPPER LIMB. an inch. Its fibres end in a tendon, which occupies the narrow oblique groove in the middle of the posterior surface of the carpal end of the radius, and is bound down in a separate compartment of the annular liga- ment ; it is inserted into the base of the terminal phalanx of the thumb. delations.—The groove which lodges the radial extensors of the carpus inter- venes between those which lodge the tendon of this muscle and the tendons of the other extensors of the thumb. Varieties.—The extensor muscles of the thumb are subject to considerable variations, and if all the three muscles be included they seem to occur as often as in one out of every six subjects dissected. The most common occur in the extensor ossis metacarpi, and consist in more or less cleavage of the muscle or its tendon into separate parts. The insertion of the distinct tendons takes place either doubly into the first metacarpal bone, or in part into the trapezium, or into the abductor or opponens pollicis muscles. The extensor primi intemodii is sometimes absent, being, as it were, fused with the extensor ossis metacarpi, in other cases it is more or less united with the extensor secundi intemodii pollicis. A frequent variety, representing a muscle normally existing in the dog and many carnivora, is formed by the interposition of an additional extensor between the indicator and the extensor secundi intemodii pollicis, with a double tendon and insertion into both fingers. The extensor indicis or indicator muscle arises from the lower end of the posterior surface of the ulna for three or four inches. The tendon passes with the common extensor through a compartment of the annular ligament, comes in contact with the tendon from that muscle destined for the index-finger, and unites with it to form the expansion already described.

Varieties.—A short additional extensor of one or more of the fingers has een observed as an occasional variety by various anatomists since Albinus, an v 0 named it extensor brevis in the case of the index-finger with which it is mos frequently connected. But it appears from later observations to vary consi - ably both in its origin, which may be from the radius or from a carpal or me a- carpal bone, and in its insertion which may be into only one or into two more of the fingers ; thus forming an extensor brevis digitorum. Nerves.—The anconeus supinator longus and extensor carpi radialis longior receive branches directly from the musculo-spiral nerve ; the short radial ex ’ the ulnar extensor of the carpus, and the common extensor of the fingers, that of the little finger, arc supplied from the radial division, while the siq

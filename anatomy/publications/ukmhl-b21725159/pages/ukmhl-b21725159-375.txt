355 THE INNOMINATE ARTERY. the left auricular appendage ; its two branches also furnish throughout their course smaller offsets, which supply the left auricle, both ventricles, and the interventricular septum. It lias been customary to describe the transverse branches of the coronary arteries as anastomosing in the left auriculo-ventricular sulcus, and the des- cending branches as anastomosing near the apex of the heart, and this description was never doubted till it was found by Hyrtl, as the result of separate injection of these vessels, that the branches of one coronary artery cannot be injected with material introduced into the other. (Nat. Hist. Review, 1801, p. 321.) Varieties. The coronary arteries have been observed in a few instances to commence by a common trunk, from which they diverged and proceeded to their usual destination. The existence of three coronaiy arteries is not a very rare •occurrence, the thud being small, and arising close by one of the others. Meckel, in one instance, observed four, the supplementary vessels appearing like branches •of one of the coronary arteries transferred to the aorta. THE INNOMINATE ARTERY. The innominate, or brachiocephalic artery, the largest of the vessels which proceed from the arch of the aorta, arises from the commence- ment of the transverse portion of the arch, before the left carotid ] ^artery. From this point the vessel ascends obliquely towards the right, until it arrives opposite the sterno-clavicular articulation of that side, nearly on a level with the upper margin of the clavicle, where it divides into the right subclavian and the right carotid artery. The place of bifurcation would, in most cases, be reached by a probe passed back- wards through the cellular interval between the sternal and clavicular portions of the stemo-mastoid muscle. The length of the innominate artery is very variable, but usually ranges from an inch and a half to two inches. This artery, lying for the most part within the thorax, is placed ! behind the first bone of the sternum, from which it is separated by the sterno-hyoid and sterno-thyroid muscles, and a little lower down by the left innominate vein, which crosses the artery at its root. The lower part of the innominate artery lies in front of the trachea, which it i crosses obliquely : on its left side is the left carotid artery, with the thymus gland or its remains ; and to the right is the corresponding hrachio-cephalic vein and the pleura. No branches usually arise from this vessel. Varieties.—The length of the innominate artery sometimes exceeds two inches, and occasionally it measures only one inch or less. Its place of division is a point of surgical interest, inasmuch as upon it in a great measure depends the * accessibility of the innominate in the neck, and the length of the right subclavian ' artery. It has sometimes been found dividing at a considerable distance above the clavicle, and sometimes, but less frequently, below it. Though usually des- titute of branches, this vessel has been observed to supply a thyroid branch, the < thyroidea ima, and sometimes a thymic branch, or a bronchial, which descends in front of the trachea. The tlujroUh ■a ima is an occasional artery. When present, it usually arises (as f ™*eady stated) from the innominate trunk, but in some instances it has been observed I to come from the right common carotid artery, or from the aorta itself. More ' arises Horn the right internal mammary, or the right subclavian.

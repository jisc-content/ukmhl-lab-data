MUSCLES OF THE UPPER LIMB. 202 The dorsal scapular artery passes between it and the bone. At its lower border is the teres major separated in part by the long head of the triceps. A bursa is sometimes found be- tween the tendon and the bone. Fig. 171.â€”Superficial Muscles of the Shoulder and Upper Limb, seen from behind. (A. T.) i a, acromion; b, base of the sca- pula ; c, tendon of the trapezius muscle over the triangular surface of the spine of the scapula ; d, olecranon of the ulna ; e, external condylar eminence; /, lower end of the ulna; 1, trapezius; 2, acro- mial part of deltoid; 2', the part of the same muscle rising from the spine of the scapula; 3, rliom- boideus major; 4, infraspinatus; 5, teres minor ; 6, teres major; 7, latissimus dorsi; +, space be- tween the trapezius, rhomboid and latissimus muscles ; S, triceps ex- tensor cubiti; 8', its outer head; 8", part of its inner head ; 9, an- coneus ; 10, part of the brachialis anticus ; 11, supinator longus; 12, extensor carpi radialis longior. The explanation of the remaining references will be found in the description of fig. 182. The teres major muscle arises from the flat oval surface on the dorsum of the scapula near its inferior angle, slightly from the axillary border of the bone, and from the septa inter- posed between it and the teres minor and infraspi- natus. It is inserted by a flat tendon about two inches wide, into the inner border of the bicipital groove of the humerus, behind and in contact with the tendon of the latissimus dorsi, to which it is ad- herent for a short space. Close to the insertion, how- ever, the tendons of these muscles are separated by a small bursa. The fibres of the muscle are longitu- dinal. i

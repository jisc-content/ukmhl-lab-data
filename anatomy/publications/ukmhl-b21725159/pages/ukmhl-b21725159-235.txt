215 SUPINATOR RADII LOXGUS. quadratic. Only one half of the flexor profundus digitorom is supplied with nerves from the median, the other half, together with the whole of the flexor carpi ulnaris, receives twigs from the idnar nerve. Fig. 176. SUPINATOR AND EXTENSOR MUSCLES. The muscles of this group are, like those of the front of the forearm, divided into a superficial and a deep layer. The superficial muscles are six in num- ber, viz., the supinator longus, the exten- sores carpi radiales longior and brevior, the extensor communis digitorum, extensor minimi digiti, and extensor carpi ulnaris. The supinator radii longus muscle arises from the upper two-thirds of the ex- ternal ridge of the humerus, and the ex- ternal inter-muscular septum. Its fibres form a thin fleshy mass which descends upon the anterior and outer border of the forearm, about the middle of which they end in a flat tendon, which is inserted into the external border of the radius, near the base of the styloid process.

INTERCOSTAL MUSCLES. 307 Commencing at the anterior extremities of the cartilages of the ribs they extend as far back as a point within the angles of those bones. The fibres incline downwards and backwards, crossing those of the external intercostals; they are, however, somewhat shorter and less oblique in their direction. Relations.—The internal are separated from, the external intercostal muscles at the back of the spaces by the intercostal vessels and nerves; they are lined internally by the pleura.

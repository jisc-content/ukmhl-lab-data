DORSAL MUSCLES OF THE TRUNK. 301 side; 7', on the left side, longissimus region, and are distinguished by being more nearly horizontal than the rest. Each arises from the upper and back part of the transverse pro- cess, and is inserted into the vertebra next above, at the inferior margin and on part of the surface of the lamina, as far as the root of the spinous process. Intertransversales.—The intertransversales are short muscles passing nearly vertically from vertebra to vertebra between the trans- verse processes. They are most developed in the cervical, and least in the dorsal region. Beneath each cervical transverse process there are two such muscles, one descending from the anterior, and another from the posterior part of the process. In the lumbar region there are like- wise two sets : one set, the intertransversales laterales, lie between the transverse processes, and are in series with the levatores costarum ; the other set, intertransversales mediates or interaccessorii, pass from the accessory process of one vertebra to the mammillary process of the next, and are in series with the intertransversales of the dor- sal region.

Interspinales.—The inter- spinales are short vertical fasci- culi of fleshy fibres, placed in pairs between the spinous processes of the contiguous vertebras. They are best marked in the neck, where they are Fig. 218.

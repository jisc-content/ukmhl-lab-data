MUSCLES OF THE LOWER LIMB. 2o0 vessels and internal popliteal nerve. The short saphenous vein is placed on ir* surface, m the interval between its two parts. Varieties.—■'The gastrocnemius is, in some cases, joined by a bundle of muscular fibres, which arises separately from the femur above one of the condyles. This bundle has been observed passing between the popliteal artery and vein (R Ounin op. cit., plate SO, figs. 4 and 5). v ' ’ The soleus muscle arises externally from the posterior surface of the head and upper third of the shaft of the fibula; internally from the oblique line which gives inser- tion to the popliteus, and from the posterior edge of the tibia about three inches below that line; and between the tibia and fibula, from a tendinous band which arches over the posterior tibial vessels and nerve. Interiorly, the muscular fibres descend upon the tendo Achillis considerably further than those of the gastroc- nemius. The posterior surface presents a thin covering of longitudinal aponeurotic fibres continued up from the tendon below, and gliding on the similar tendinous surface of the gastrocnemius muscle. On the deep surface the edges of two membranous tendons, the other edges of which look towards the middle line of the muscle, imbedded in its substance, are seen descend- ing from the tibial and fibular origins : the fibres from the deep aspects of those tendons are directed obliquely inwards to a tendinous Fig. 194.

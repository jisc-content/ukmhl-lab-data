205 biceps flexor cubiti. inserted into a supracondylar process. The middle division of the muscle is most constant in man : but is generally accompanied by a part of the third ; the musculo-cutaneous nerve passing between them. The first and third constitute the most marked varieties in man, and all three are found m various forms and degrees of development in different animals. The internal brachial ligament of Struthers isTa fibrous band connected with the inferior part of this muscle. (John Wood, on Hum. Muse. Variations, &c., Joum. of Anat. vol. i. p. 15.) Fig. 172.

The biceps flexor cubiti muscle has two heads of origin : one of these, the internal or short head, arises conjointly with the coraco- brachialis from the coracoid process of the scapula by a tendon which is soon continued into muscle ; the other, the long head, arises by a rounded tendon from the upper border of the glenoid fossa and glenoid ligament, within the capsule of the shoulder-joint, and this tendon, passing over the head of the humerus, leaves the joint by the bicipital groove, gradually enlarging into the fleshy head as it descends. The two muscular heads, lying side by side, then unite to form an elongated and thick belly, occupying the middle and lower part of the arm : a

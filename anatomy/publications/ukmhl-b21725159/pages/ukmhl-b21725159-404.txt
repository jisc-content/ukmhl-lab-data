384 THE SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY. passes along tlio roots of the spinal nerves, supplying the spinal cord and its membranes, and anastomoses with the other spinal arteries; the other branch ramifies on the back part of the bodies of the vertebrae in the same manner as similar branches derived from the intercostal and lumbar arteries. (/;) Muscular branches of variable size are distributed to the deep-seated cervical muscles. B. Cranial branches : (a) The posterior meningeal artery is a small branch which arises opposite the foramen magnum, and ramifies between the dura mater and the bone in the occipital fossa, and upon the falx cerebelli. There are sometimes two of these small vessels. (Ji) Tho posterior spinal artery, arising at an obtuse angle from the vertebral, inclines backwards round the medulla oblongata to reach the back part of the spinal cord ; aided by reinforcements from small arteries which ascend upon the cervical and dorsal nerves through the intervertebral foramina, it may be traced along the cord, lying behind the roots of the nerves, as a minute tortuous vessel, or rather a series of little inosculating vessels, as far as the second lumbar vertebra, where it terminates in ramifications on the cauda equina.

MUSCLES OF THE LOWER LIMB. 23G ascending1 branches of the external circumflex artery. At its origin it lies between the sartorius and anterior border of the gluteus medius muscles. Fig. 187. Fig. 187.â€”Deep Dissection of the Muscles of the Abdomen and Pelvis. (A. T.) 1 a, twelfth dorsal vertebra ; b, fifth lumbar vertebra ; c, transverse process of the first lumbar vertebra; 1, quadratus lumborum muscle; on the left side, its fibres of origin from the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebra are shown by the removal of the psoas muscles ; 2, placed upon one of the intertransversales muscles of the left side; 3, the upper part of the psoas parvus, drawn somewhat to the outer side ; 3', the inser- tion of its tendon into the brim of the pelvis; 4, the upper part of the psoas magnus; 4", one of the origins of the muscle ; 4, the insertion of the muscle into the lesser trochanter of the femur ; 5, iliacus shown fully on the left side by the removal of the psoas muscles ; 5', insertion of the iliacus muscle into a line below the trochanter minor ; 6, pyriformis muscle of the left side rising within the pelvis from the sacrum ; &, insertion of its tendon into the summit of the great trochanter ; 7, the obturator externus seen from before on the left side ; + +, the right and left crura of the diaphragm on the front of the upper lumbar vertebra. The sartorius muscle is very long, narrow, aucl ribbon-shaped, and presents the longest fibres of all the muscles of the body : it arises by a short tendon from the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium, and from a small part of the anterior margin of that bone immediately below, and, passing downwards and inwards across the front of the thigh, is inserted by an expanded aponeurosis into the inner side ot the tibia, near to the tubercle, and for about an inch below it.

OCCIPITO-VERTEBRAL ARTICULATIONS. 13a The lateral or alar odontoid ligaments are two thick and very strono- bundles of fibres, which extend from the sides of the summit of the odontoid process outwards and a little upwards to be implanted into the rough depression on the inner side of each condyle of the occipital bone, and into a small part of the margin of the foramen magnum. Some of the fibres of the two ligaments are continuous across the middle line. Fig. 124.—Transverse Section similar to THAT REPRESENTED IN FlG. 122, THE CRUCI- FORM Ligaments having been removed. (A.

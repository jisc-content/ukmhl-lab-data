Fig. 39. SUPERIOR MAXILLARY ROXE. 47 Rig. 39.—Superior Maxillary Bone op the hollowed out beneath the orbital plate in the body of the bone. The superior maxillary bone articulates with its fellow, with the nasal, frontal, lachrymal, ethmoid, palate, malar, vomer, and inferior turbi- nated bones, and with the nasal cartilages. The alveolar border or process, thick and arched, is hollowed out into sockets or alveoli, corresponding in number, form, and depth to the roots of the teeth, which are fixed in them. The palate plate, along with that of the opposite side, forms about three-fourths of the hard palate. Its superior surface is smooth and concave from side to side ; its inferior surface is vaulted and rough, and is marked laterally with grooves for nerves and vessels, which reach the palate through the posterior palatine canal. Its posterior extremity falls short of that of the alveolar arch and body of the bone, and articulates with the horizontal process of the palate bone, which completes the hard palate. The mesial border rises into a serrated vertical ridge, which, with its fellow, constitutes in front the nasal crest—a grooved elevation which sup- ports the extremity of the vomer and the septal cartilage, and is prolonged forwards into the nasal spine. This ridge is interrupted at its anterior part by a canal, the incisor foramen, which is completed on its mesial side by a slender lamina passing from the anterior to the posterior border. Each incisor foramen widens out below into a larger hollow, which when placed in appo- sition with that of the opposite side, completes a mesial aperture, the anterior palatine foramen. Viewed from below, this aperture may be seen to be divided into four smaller foramina, two of which, placed laterally, are the incisor foramina, called also foramina of Stenson. while the other two, placed in the middle line, one before, the other behind, Right Side.

These figures also exhibit a full set of the upper teeth of one side as they occur in middle life.

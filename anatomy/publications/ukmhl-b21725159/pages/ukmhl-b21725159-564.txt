544 THE CRANIAL NERVES. (<0 Articular branch.—The nerve to the temporo-maxillary articulation comes from one of the preceding branches, or directly from the auriculo-temporal nerve. (/) Temporal branches—One of these, the smaller and posterior of the two, distributes filaments to the attrahens auriculam muscle, the upper part of the pinna and the integument above it. The anterior temporal branch extends with the superficial temporal artery to the top of the head, and ends in the integument. It is often united with the temporal branch of the upper maxillary nerve. Meckel mentions a communication between this branch and the occipital nerve. Lingual Nerve.—The lingual branch (or gustatory nerve), descends under cover of the external pterygoid muscle, lying to the inner side and in front of the dental nerve, and sometimes united to it by a cord which crosses over the internal maxillary artery. It is there joined at Fig, 340. Fi". 340.—View op the Branches op the Inferior Maxillary Nerve from the outer side (from Sappey after Hirsckfeld and Leveille). § The zygoma and ramus of the jaw have been removed, and tbe outer plate of the jaw taken off, so as to open up the dental canal ; the lower part of the temporal muscle has been dissected off the bone, and the masseter muscle turned down. 1 Masseteric branch, descending to the deep surface of the muscle ; 2, a twig to the temporal muscle ; 5, anterior, and 7, posterior deep temporal nerves ; 3, buccal; 4, its union with the facial ; 6, filaments given by the buccal to the external pterygoid muscle ; 8 auriculo-temporal nerve ; 9, its temporal branches ; 10, its anterior auricular branches: 11, its union with the facial ; 12, gustatory or lingual nerve ; 13,mylo-hyoid nerve ; 14, inferior dental nerve; 15, its twigs supplied to the teeth; 16, mental branches ; 1/, branch of the facial uniting with the mental.

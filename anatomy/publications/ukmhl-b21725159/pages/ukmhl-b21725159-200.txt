-80 ARTICULATIONS OF THE LOWER LIMB. The interosseous ligaments are found to vary somewhat in their connections from those here stated, being sometimes attached at once to the contiguous sides of two tarsal and two metatarsal bones. Attention was first particularly directed to these ligaments by M. Lisfranc, in connection with the amputation of the foot through the tarso-metatarsal articulation. See “ Manuel des Opera- tions Chirurgicales,” &c. Par J. Coster. 3rd edit. Paris, 1829. Synovial membranes.—There are three synovial membranes in this irregular series of articulations, a. One belongs to the internal cunei- form and the first metatarsal bone : the joint formed between these two bones is altogether separate and out of the range of the rest. b. A second synovial membrane is placed between the cuboid and the fourth and fifth metatarsal bones; this is isolated on the inner side by the external interosseous ligament, c. The third or middle one is placed between the middle and external cuneiform and the second and third metatarsal bones, and is prolonged between the two last-named bones, as well as sometimes between the third and fourth metatarsal bones. The disposition of this last synovial membrane is subject to variation. Metatarsal Articulations.—The metatarsal bones are bound together at their tarsal and digital ends ; very firmly in the former, and loosely in the latter situation. The tarsal ends of the four outer bones articulate with each other, hav- ing lateral cartilaginous surfaces and provided with synovial membrane, and are connected by dorsal, plantar, and interosseous ligaments.

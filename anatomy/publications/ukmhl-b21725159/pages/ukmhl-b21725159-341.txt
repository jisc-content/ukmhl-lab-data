321 RECTUS ABDOMINIS MUSCLE. When one or two additional transverse lines occur, they are usually incomplete; one of them is very generally placed below the umbilicus, the position of the other is variable. The inter- sections do not usually penetrate the whole thickness of the mus- cle, but are confined chiefly to its anterior fibres, and are firmly united to the anterior wall of the sheath of the Sedieatii 6 ^ p0sterior surface of tlie muscle has no attachment tc Fig. 226.—Deep Muscles OF THE FOREPART OF the Trunk and Shoul- der.

TIIE CRANIAL NERVES. C54 EIGHTH PAIR OF NERVES. The eighth pair is composed of three distinct nerves—the glosso pharyngeal, pneumo-gastric, and spinal accessory, which leave the skull through the anterior and inner division of the foramen lacerum posti- cum, to the inner side and in front of the internal jugular vein. Two ol these nerves, the glosso-pharyngeal and pncumo-gastric, are attached to the medulla oblongata in the same line, and resemble one another somewhat in their distribution, for both are distributed to the first part of the alimentary canal. The other, the spinal accessory, takes its origin chiefly from the spinal cord, and is mainly distributed to muscles; but it gives fibres to the first two nerves by its communicating branch. I.—GLOSSO-PHARYNGEAL NERVE. The glosso-pharyngeal nerve is destined, as the name implies, for the tongue and pharynx. Surface attachment.—The nerve arises from the surface of the restiform body of the medulla by five or six roots, arranged in a vertical line, the highest being contiguous to the facial and auditory nerves, the lowest to the highest roots of the pneumogastric. Deep origin.—The fibres pass inwards and backwards through the substance of the medulla, to reach the nucleus, a small column of large nerve-cells placed deeply beneath the lower part of the floor of the fourth ventricle, between the highest part of the vagal nucleus and the lower part of the inner auditory nucleus.

Course and distribution.—Directed outwards from its place of origin over the flocculus to the foramen jugulare, it leaves the skull with the pneumo-gastric and spinal accessory nerves, but in a separate tube of dura mater.

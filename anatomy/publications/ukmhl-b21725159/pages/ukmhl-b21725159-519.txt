K K 2 BRANCHES OF THE INTERNAL ILL1C VEIN. diately underneath the mucous membrane. From it proceed sup. middle, and inferior hemorrhoidal veins accompanying the arteries the same name, and it communicates freely with the plexuses in front of it. The superior hemorrhoidal vein being a branch belonging to the portal system, the hemorrhoidal plexus forms a very direct communi- cation between the portal and general venous systems. The greater part of the os innominatum and pelvic wall of the left side, and the upper parts of the rectum and urinary bladder, have been removed : the left common iliac and the right internal iliac arteries, and the left external and internal iliac veins, have been cut short, a, the right psoas magnus muscle; b, the anterior su- perior iliac spine; c, Poupart’s ligament ; d, the cavernous"and spongy body of the penis divided near the root; +, the spongy body of the bulb, above which the mem- branous part of the urethra, the prostate, &c. ; e, the left os pubis close to the symphysis ; /, the anus ; (j, the spine of the ischium with the short sacro-sciatic ligament; A,.auricular saero-iliac surface ; i, interior of the urinary bladder ; h, exterior of the rectum ; l, transverse process of the fourth lumbar vertebra ; 1, lower part of the vena cava inferior; 1', abdominal aorta ; 2, common iliac veins; 21, right common iliac artery; 3, external iliac veins ; 3', external iliac artery ; 4, internal iliac veins, that of the right side entire, that of the left divided and in great part removed ; 5, middle and other veins of the sacral plexus; 6, ilio-lumbar and lumbar veins ; 7, right gluteal and upper lateral sacral veins ; 8, 8', obturator vein and artery of the right side ; 9, pelvic plexus of veins of the right side ; 9', that of the left side connected with the lower vesical plexus ; 10, placed on the right side on the short sacro- sciatic ligament immediately below the division of the internal iliac vein into the pudic and sciatic veins : on the left side, below 4, the sciatic vein is cut short; 10, lower down, the pudic vein ; 10', the perineal veins ; 11, placed on the prostate among the lower vesical veins, into one of which the left dorsal vein of the penis, 11, is seen to pass ; 12, placed on the lower part of the rectum, may indicate the plexus of luemorr- lxoidal veins. The vaginal plexus, surrounding the vagina principally in its lower part, communicates freely with the hccmorrlioidal and vesical plexuses.

EXTENSOR COMMUNIS DIGITORUM, lu onwards, are joined together towards the middle or fore part of the second phalanx, and, having passed beyond this, are inserted into the last pha- lanx. On the index and little fingers the tendons are joined before their division, by the special extensor tendons of those digits. Fig. 177.—Deep Posterior Muscles of the Forearm. (A.

On the back of the hand the tendon of the ring-finger gives off two processes, one on each side, the lateral vincula, which pass obliquely downwards to join the tendons of the middle and little fingers: in consequence of this arrange- ment it follows that, if those two fingers be flexed, the tendon of the ring-finger is held downwards, and it becomes impos- sible to extend that finger by the action of the muscle. The tendon of the index- finger is only united to that of the middle finger by a loose transverse, semi- transparent band of fibres, and is free in its action. A synovial membrane invests the tendons of this muscle as they pass under the annular ligament.

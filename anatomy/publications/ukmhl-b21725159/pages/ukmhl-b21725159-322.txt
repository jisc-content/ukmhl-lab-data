DORSAL MUSCLES OF THE TRUNK. 302 Fig. 217.â€”View of thb deep Muscles of thb Rack, showing their Attachments to tub Vertebral Column anu Ribs. (A. T.) } On the left side the sevc. ral parts of the erector spi. n;e are nearly in their na- tural position, with the exception of the spinalig dorsi, which is drawn out laterally from the spines of the vertebras ; on the right side the spinalis dorsi has been entirely removed, the ilio-costalis drawn to the outer side so as to expose its accessory muscle, and the longissimus removed, excepting small portions at its insertions. Superiorly on the left side, the trache- lomastoid and complexus are left nearly in their natural positions ; while, on the right side, the trachelo-mastoid has been entirely removed, and the complexus, separated from its occipital attachment, has been spread out so as to stretch its vertebral attachments, a, occipital protuberance ; b, mastoid process ; c, bifid spinous process of the axis ver- tebra ; I, spinous process of the first dorsal vertebra and first rib ; VI, sixth dorsal spine and trans- verse process and sixth rib; XII, twelfth dorsal spine and twelfth rib. On the left side of the figure, 1, coin- plexus muscle; 2, trachelo- mastoid ; 3, serratus pos- ticus superior, detached from the vertebral column and drawn upwards from the ribs ; 4, 4, the slips of attachment of the serratus posticus inferior to the four lower ribs ; 5, three slips of origin of the latis- simus dorsi from the lower ribs ; 5', iliac origin of the same muscle ; <3 + > common origin of the lon- gissimus dorsi and ilio-cos- talis from the ilium and sacrum, &c. ; 6, upper part of the longissimus dorsiJ 6', transversalis cervicis continued up from the lon-

THE CARDIAC VEINS. £03 and is described by him under the name of vena parumbilicalis. (Champneys, “ Joum. of Anat.,” vol. vi., p. 416). VEINS OP THE HEART. The greater number of the cardiac veins are collected into a large common trunk which pours its blood into the postenoi part of the right auricle, in the angle between the inferior vena cava and the right auriculo-ventricular orifice. The terminal part of this vein is consi- derably dilated, and is named the coronary sinus. I he puncipal veins leading into it are named the great, the postenoi, and the anterior coronary veins. Among these the first alone desei \ cs the name of coronary, as it surrounds the heart m the left auncu o-ventn- cular groove. Besides the larger cardiac veins which join the great coronary sinus, there are also small separate veins (vense minima; coidis), which ope11 directly into the right auricle, especially along . its right border. The openings of these veins, as well as some depressions which do not admit veins, have been named foramina Thebesn. Fig. 321. — View op the Adult Heart, FROM BEHIND, TO SHOW THE CORONARY VEINS. (A.

I a, placed on the back of the right auricle, points to the Eustachian valve seen within the opening of the iuferior vena cava ; b, the back of the left auricle; c, the right ventri- cle ; d, left ventricle ; e, vena cava supe- rior ; /, arch of the aorta; 1, sinus of the great coronary vein ; 2, great coronary vein turn- ing round the heart in the auriculo-ventrieular groove ; 3, 4, posterior branches ; 5, one of the small right cardiac veins passing directly into the right auricle ; 6, the vestige of the left superior vena cava proceeding over the left auricle downwards to join the coronary sinus. The veins of the heart are without valves excepting at their terminations. The great cardiac vein (vena cordis magna) is a vessel of considerable size, and from the way in which it coils round the left side of the base of the heart, or rather of the ven- tricle, it may be^named “coronary.” Its chief branch runs along the groove upon the fore part of the heart, corresponding with the septum of the ventricles. Commencing at the apex of the heart, it gradually increases in size as it approaches the base of the ventricles, and then inclining backwards and to the left side in the groove between the left auricle and ventricle, ends in the coronary sinus : a valve of two seg- ments closes its aperture in the sinus. In this course it receives bianches from the ventricles, especially from the left, and also from tne left auricle: and as it passes round the thick margin of the left ventiicle, it receives a vein of some size which ascends to join it. he posterior cardiac veins ascend on the back of the ventricles, especially on the left, and open into the coronary sinus by four or more

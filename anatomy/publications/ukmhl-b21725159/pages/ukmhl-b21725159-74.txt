BONES OF THE IIEAD. 54 ol a pair of articular surfaces or condyles. It has the shape of an inverted arch bent forwards upon itself, and consists of a middle larger and horizontal part—the body, and of two rami or ascending branches. The body is marked in the middle by a vertical ridge, indicating the original division of the bone into two lateral parts, and thence named the symphysis. The superior or alveolar border is hollowed out into sockets for the teeth. The inferior border, thicker anteriorly than beneath the ramus, is slightly everted in front, constituting the chin, or mentum, a prominence peculiar to the human skull. On the outer surface, on each side of the symphysis, below the incisor teeth, is a shallow depression, the incisor fossa,, which gives origin to the levator menti muscle, and, more externally, the labial or mental foremen, which transmits the branches of the inferior dental nerve and artery. From beneath the mental foramen an elevation, the external oblique line, extends upwards and outwards to the anterior border of the ramus. The deep surface is marked, on each side of the symphysis, along the inferior margin, by an oval depression,, indicating the anterior attach- ment of the digastric muscles, and above them by two pairs of Fig. 47.

An oblique prominent line, the mylo- hyoidean ridge, leading from beneath the spinal mentales, upwards and outwards to the ramus, gives attachment to the mylo-hyoideus muscle. Above this line is a smooth depression for the sublingual gland, and beneath and external to it another for the submaxillary gland. The ramus is thinner than the body of the bone. Its posterior border in meeting the line of the base forms the angle of the jaw. The external surface is flat and uneven, and towards the angle stronger ridges mark the place of attachment of the masseter muscle. The internal surface presents at its middle the inferior dental foramen, leading into the dental canal, which lodges the dental nerve and vessels. Passing

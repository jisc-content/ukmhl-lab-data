125 COMPARISON OF TIIE ARM AND LEG BONES. Figs. 110 & 111.—Sketch Fig. 111. Fig. 110. op the Bones op the Thoracic and Pelvic Limbs so placed as to show corresponding PARTS IN BOTH. (A. T.) h The preaxial borders of both limbs are towards the reader’s right hand, and the dorsal or true ex- tensor surfaces are shown throughout the whole ex- tent of the limbs. The somewhat artificial repre- sentation given in these figures cannot be obtained from a single view of the specimens in one position, but it is easily brought out by slightly shifting the bones or changing the point of view. The hu- meral tuberosities are separated so as to show them on the borders of the bone.

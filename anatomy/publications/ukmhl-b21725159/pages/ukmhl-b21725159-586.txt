THE CRANIAL NERVES. scg crosses over the external carotid below the digastric muscle. Above the hyoid bone it is crossed by the lower part of the stylo-hyoid muscle and posterior belly of the digastric, and rests on the hyo-glossus muscle. At the anterior border of the hyo-glossus it is connected with the gusta- tory nerve, and is continued in the fibres of the genio-liyo-glossus. muscle beneath the tongue to the tip, distributing branches upwards to the muscular substance. The principal branches of this nerve are distributed to the muscles ascending to the larynx and hyoid bone, and to those of the tongue ; a few serve to connect it with some of the neighbouring nerves.

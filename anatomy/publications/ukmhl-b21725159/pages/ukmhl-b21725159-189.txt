1G9 INTERIOR OF THE KNEE-JOINT. tached inferiorly to the back of the pit behind the tibial spine, and superiorly to the fore part of the intercondylar hollow, as well as slightly to the side of the inner condyle of the femur; its fibres are directed upwards and a little forwards. _ The semilunar cartilages are two crescent-shaped interarticular fibro- cartilages, placed on the articulating surfaces of the head of the tibia, and interposed between these and the condyles of the femur They have each a synovial surface above and below, and a convex border, which is thick, while the concave border is thinned to a fine edge, and the part of the articular surface of the tibia within the concave border of each cartilage is left uncovered. At their extremities they are fibrous, and are firmly fixed to the head of the tibia, whilst by the cir- cumference they are connected with the fibrous capsule of the joint.

The internal semilunar cartilage forms nearly a semicircle ; its anterior cornu is small and pointed, and is inserted into an impres- sion at the fore and outer part of the internal articular surface of the tibia ; its posterior end is attached to the inner edge of the hollow behind the spine, and is in relation with the posterior crucial liga- i ment. The external semilunar cartilage forms more than three-fourths of i a circle ; its two cornua, fixed, one before, the other between the points of i the spine of the tibia, are so close at their insertion that they may be said to be interposed between the attachments of the internal semilunar . plate. Its external border is in contact behind with the tendon of the • popliteus muscle, and is therefore separated by this from the fibrous I capsule. From this fibro-cartilage a ligamentous band ascends, to be ; attached to the inner condyle of the femur in connection either in front i; or behind with the posterior crucial ligament (accessory band of ike \ 'posterior crucial ligament). Transverse ligament.—Towards the front of the joint the convex > borders of the interarticular fibro-cartilages are connected by a slight s transverse band, which receives this name. Its thickness varies much 1 in different bodies. Capsular membrane.—Under this name is described the fibrous f- tissue which invests the joint in the intervals between the strongei I bands which have been named ligaments. It is incomplete,notextend- ing underneath the tendons of the extensor muscles. Between the sides

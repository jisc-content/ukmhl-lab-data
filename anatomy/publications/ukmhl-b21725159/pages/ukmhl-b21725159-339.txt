CREMASTER MUSCLE. <>19 the internal attachment, smaller and less constant, is by means of a tendinous band to the spine and crest of the pubis, close to the inser- tion of the internal oblique muscle. The superior fibres of the muscle Fig. 225.—Lateral View of the Trunk, giving A DEEP VIEW OF THE Serratus Magnus and Transversalis Abdo- minis Muscles. (A. T.) i Fig. 225. The serratus magnus is j stretched out by the sca- | pula being drawn away from the ribs, a, coracoid process of the scapula ; b, glenoid cavity; c, lower angle ; d, first dorsal ver- tebra ; e, placed on the os i pubis, points to the inser- fa tion of (rimbemat’s liga- i ment; I, VI, XU, the first, I sixth, and twelfth ribs ; 'i L', first lumbar vertebra ; I 1, upper portion of the serratus magnus attached I to the first and second j ribs; 2, second or middle i portion attached to the I second and third ribs ; 3, | lower or fan-shaped por- tion attached to the ribs from the fourth to the ninth ; 4, the external in- tercostal muscles; 5, upper costal origins of the trans- versalis abdominis; 6, origins of the muscles from the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae by the lumbar aponeurosis ; 6', part rising from the crest of the ilium ; 7, lower [ portion rising from the upper half of Poupart’s ligament, and passing over the internal inguinal aper- ture ; 8, the sheath of the rectus muscle opened in its upper part by removing the aponeurosis of the ob- i lique muscles ; 9, the same < in its lower part left entire at the place where the tendons pass entirely in front of the rectus muscle ; 10, the interspinales muscles pyriformis. of the lumbar vertebrae ; 11, gluteus minimus ; 12, extend between those attachments in a series of successively longer loops, descending in front of the spermatic cord, a few of them reaching as low as the level of the testicle : the remaining fibres, the greatest number of which descend from the outer attachment, and a few from the inner, spread out inferiorly and are embedded in the substance of a

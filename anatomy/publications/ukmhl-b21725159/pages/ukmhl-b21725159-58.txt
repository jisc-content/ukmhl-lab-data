But in front the border is thicker, looks directly forwards, and is serrated for articulation with the great wing of the sphenoid bone. Fig. 33. Fig. 33.—Right Tempo- ral Bone from the outside. (A. T.) § 1, the external surface of the squamous part; 2, the zygoma; 3, the mas- toid part ; 3 x, the mas- toid process ; 4, the arti- cular part of the glenoid fossa ; 5, the articular eminence at the root of the zygoma, and above it the tubercle; 6, fissure of Glaser ; 7, the tympanic plate forming the posterior non-articular part of the glenoid fossa, terminating behind in the vaginal pro- cess ; 8, the meatus audi- torius externus; 9, the auditory process ; 10, the styloid process ; 13 x, the mastoid foramen. The outer surface is in its greatest extent vertical, with a slight con- vexity, and forms part of the temporal fossa. From its lowest part a long process, the zygoma, takes origin. Fig. 34. Fig. 34.—The Right Tem- poral Bone from the inner side. (A. T.) f The indications where marked are the same as in the preceding figure. 11, the inner or cerebral surface of the squamous portion ; 11 x , the squamous edge, 12, inner surface of the mastoid por- tion ; 13, the sigmoid groove of the lateral sinus — the figure is placed at its upper part, and close to the mastoid foramen ; 14, the apex of the petrous bone ; 15, the meatus auditorius internus ; 16, the scale of bone covering the aqueduct of the vestibule ; 17, is above the aqueduct of the cochlea ; 18, the superior petrosal groove ; 19, the eminence of the superior semicircular canal; 20, the hiatus Fallopii. The zygoma, or zygomatic process, is connected with the lower and outer part of the squamous portion, and is of considerable breadth at its base, which projects outwards. It then becomes narrower, and is

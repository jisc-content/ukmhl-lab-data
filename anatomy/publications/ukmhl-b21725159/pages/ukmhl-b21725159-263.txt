213 FASCIJE OF THE LEG. ! the femoral artery nerve. and vein, together with the internal saphenous Relations. This muscle is in contact in front with the long and short adductors, the vastus intemus, the obturator nerve, and the profunda artery, behind with the hamstring muscles, gluteus maximus, and great sciatic nerve, internally with the gracilis muscle, superiorly with the obturator extemus and quadratus femoris muscles, and along the line of attachment to the femur it is pierced by the femoral and perforating arteries. Varieties.—The adductor muscles are so closely related that their varieties may be conveniently considered together. The poet incus has been found double, as already stated. It has also been seen attached to the capsule of the hip-joint, or even inserted into it. The adductor longus may be double, or it may extend as far as the knee with its tendon of insertion inseparable from that of the adductor magnus. The adductor brevis is frequently found divided into two or three parts, or it may be incorporated with the adductor magnus. The adductor magnus varies in the degree of its segmentation. Its condylar part has been found quite distinct from the rest of the muscle. The upper transverse part is so frequently divided from the rest by the superior profunda artery, that it is looked upon by some anatomists as a special muscle, being called the adductor mittimus (Henle, Gunther, Macalister). On the other hand, the muscle has been found undivided, and its upper part completely imited to the quadratus femoris (Mac- alister). Nerves.—The adductor muscles as a whole are supplied by the obturator nerve, but the adductor magnus likewise receives a branch from the great sciatic, and the outer part of the pectineus sometimes has a branch from the anterior crural. Actions.—The gracilis acts as an adductor of the limb. The gracilis, semi- tendinosus, semimembranosus, and sartorius muscles, together with the popliteus, all rotate the leg inwards at the knee-joint; the latter muscle acting chiefly in the flexed state of the knee. The pectineus is partly a flexor and partly an adductor. The adductorcs magnus, longus, and brevis, adduct the thigh, and, along with their opponents the gluteus medius and minimus, and with the gluteus maximus, balance the body on the femur in walking. The iliopsoas and the adductor muscles, together with the pectineus, being all. inserted at the back part of the femur, tend to rotate the thigh outwards at the same time that they produce their adducting and flexing actions. The advan- tage of this preponderance of rotators outwards over rotators inwards becomes apparent by reference to the movements which take place in walking. Wien a step is taken, the pelvis is drawn forwards on that side on which the foot has been advanced, which involves a considerable rotation of the pelvis backwards at the other hip-joint, by the action of the muscles of the opposite limb.

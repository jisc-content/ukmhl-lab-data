51 VOMER. MALAR BONE. maxillary fosaa into the nasal cavity, and transmits the internal nerves from Meckel’s ganglion and the nasal branch of the internal maxillary artery. THE VOMER. The vomer is a thin mesial bone, irregularly quadrilateral, and placed vertically between the nasal fossa;. It articulates with the sphenoid, ethmoid, palate, and maxillary bones, and with the septal cartilage of the nose. It usually becomes united by anchylosis, at an ■earlv a^e, to other bones. . 7 7 , The "lower and back part of the vomer forms a tlnn mesial plate, while the upper and. anterior part consists of two ala, rising on each side of a mesial groove, in which lies the septal cartilage of the nose. The aim posteriorly are thick and expanded, and form the bma posterior extremity of the bone, which rests beneath the sphenoid. 1 ie superior border of each ala articulates edge to edge with the lamella projecting inwards at the base of the internal pterygoid plate, and Fig. 42.—The Vomer (A.

The anterior extremity of the vomer forms a short vertical plate which fits in behind the nasal crest of the maxil- laries, and from the upper end of which a process projects forwards in the groove of the crest, while from its lower end a point projects downwards between the incisor fora- mina. The inferior border articulates with the ridge or ■crest which rises from the palate plates of the maxillary and palate bones. The posterior border, thin, smooth, and unattached, separates the posterior nares. THE MALAR BONE. _ The malar bone forms the most prominent part of the cheek, and divides the orbit from the temporal fossa. It articulates by a broad serrated surface near its anterior inferior angle with the malar process of the superior maxillary bone, by a slender posterior process with the zygoma, by a superior process with the frontal, and, continuously with that, by the margin of its deep plate with the great wing of the sphe- noid bone. Between its sphenoidal and maxillary articulations a small portion of free margin generally intervenes, which closes the anterior

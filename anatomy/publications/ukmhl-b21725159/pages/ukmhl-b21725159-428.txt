ARTERIES OF TIIE UPPER LIMB. 408 the pronator teres, both of which muscles it partly supplies. On reaching the front of the condyle, it anastomoses with the inferior profunda and anastomotic branches of the brachial. The posterior ulnar recurrent artery, larger than the preceding* comes off lower down ; but not unfrequently the two vessels arise by a short common trunk. The posterior recurrent runs inwards and backwards beneath the flexor sublimis, and then ascends behind the inner condyle. In the interval between that process and the olecranon it lies beneath the flexor carpi ulnaris, and passing between the heads of that muscle along the ulnar nerve, supplies branches to the muscles, to the elbow joint, and to the nerve itself. This branch communicates with the inferior profunda, the anastomotic, and, over the olecranon, likewise with the interosseous recurrent. Fig. 267.

(A. T.) g 1,1, upper inguinal glands receiving the lower abdominal, the inguinal, penal, and scrotal lymphatic vessels ; 2, 2, femoral or lower inguinal glands, receiving the anterior, internal, and external femoral lymphatic ves- sels ; 2', the internal lymphatic vessels ; 3, 3, large plexus of lymphatic vessels in the course of the saphenous veins ; 4, the same descend- ing upon the leg; 5, posterior lymphatics of the calf of the leg ; 6, lymphatic vessels of the dorsum of the foot; 7, those of the heel and inner ankle. LYMPHATICS OF THE LOWER LIMB. The superficial inguinal glands vary much in number, amounting on an average to eight or ten : they are divisible into a superior or oblique and an inferior or vertical set. The oblique glands lie in the line of Poupart’s ligament and re- ceive lymphatics from the integu- ments of the trunk and genital organs, together with a few from the upper and outer part of the limb : the vertical glands surround the upper part of the long saphenous vein, and extend two or three inches downwards along the course of that vessel ; they receive the greater number of the lymphatics which ascend from the limb. The efferent vessels of the superficial inguinal glands perforate the fascia, come into connection with those situated deeply, pass into the abdomen by the side of the blood-vessels, and being connected with a chain of lymphatics which lie along the ex- ternal iliac artery, terminate in the lumbar glands. The deep-seated inguinal glands are placed beneath the others, and surround the femoral artery and vein. The superficial lymphatics of the lower limb arise in two sets, one from the inner part of the dor- which ascend with the femoral artery to the groin.

93 METACARPAL BOXES. the unciform bone. Inferiorly this bone articulates by three distinct surfaces, of which the middle is much the largest, with the second, third, and fourth metacarpal bones. The os magnum articulates with seven bones, viz., the scaphoid, semilunar, trapezoid, unciform, and second, third, and fourth metacarpal bones. The unciform bone is readily distinguished by the large process projecting forwards and curved slightly outwards on its anterior sur- face. Seen from the front or behind, it has a triangular form. Its external surface is vertical, and articulates with the os magnum ; its inferior surface is divided into two facets which articulate with the fourth and fifth metacarpal bones ; its superior surface, meeting the cuneiform, is concavo-convex, inclines upwards and outwards towards the head of the os magnum, and is separated internally by a rough border from the inferior surface. The unciform articulates with five bones, viz., the os magnum, semilunar, cuneiform, and fourth and fifth metacarpal bones. THE METACARPUS. The metacarpus, the part of the hand which supports the fingers, consists of five shafted bones, diverging slightly from each other, and which are numbered from without inwards. Fig. 79.

The metacarpal bones arc placed in a segment of an arch transversely, and being at the same time slightly curved, longitudinally they present a concavity directed forwards. They are terminated at their carpal extremities by expanded portions of different forms, and at the digital ends by large rounded heads. The first metacarpal bone is thicker and shorter than the others. Of the remaining bones the third is the longest and thickest, the second, fourth, and fifth decreasing regu- larly in length, according to their position from without inwards. The shaft of the first metacarpal bone is somewhat compressed from before backwards, flat behind, and transversely convex in front. The shafts of the others are prismatic, presenting a broad surface towards the back of the hand, and towards the palm a rounded margin between the two lateral surfaces. They are most slender immediately beyond the carpal extremity, and become gradually thicker towards the head. .1 hey present on their dorsal surfaces each a triangular subcutaneous

581 BRANCHES FROM THE CERVICAL PLEXUS. the plexus communicates with the pneumo-gastric, spinal accessoiy, hypoglossal, and sympathetic nerves. Fig. 356. Fig. 356.â€”Deep Dissection of the Axilla, showing tiif. Brachial Plexus and neighbouring Nerves (from Sappey after HirscMeld and Levcilld). i The clavicle has been sawn through near its sternal end, and is turned aside with the muscles attached to it; the subclavius and the greater and lesser pectoral muscles have been removed from the front of the axilla. 1, loop of union between the descendens noni and a branch of the cervical plexus ; 2, pneumo-gastric ; 3, phrenic passing down to the inner side of the scalenus anticus muscle ; 4, anterior primary division of the fifth cervical nerve ; 5, the same of the sixth ; 6, 7, the same of the seventh and eighth cervical nerves ; 8, the same of the first dorsal nerve ; 9, 9, branch from the plexus to the sub- clavius muscle, communicating with the phrenic nerve ; 10, posterior thoracic nerve dis- tributed to the serratus magnus ; 11, upper anterior thoracic nerve passing into the great pectoral muscle ; 13, lower anterior thoracic distributed to the lesser pectoral; 14, twig of communication between these two nerves ; 12, suprascapular nerve passing through the suprascapular notch ; 15, lower of the two subscapular nerves; 16, nerve of the teres major; 17, long subscapular, or nerve of the latissimus dorsi ; 18, accessory of the internal cutaneous nerve ; 19, union of the accessory cutaneous with the second and third intercostal nerves ; 20, lateral branch of the second intercostal; 21, second internal cutaneous or nerve of Wrisberg ; 22, internal cutaneous nerve ; 23, the ulnar nerve to the inside of the axillary artery, passing behind the vein, and having, in this case, a union with the upper division of the plexus ; 24, the median nerve im- mediately below the place where its two roots embrace the artery, which is divided above this place ; 25, the musculo-cutaneous nerve passing into the coraco-brachialis muscle ; 26, the musculo-spiral nerve passing behind the divided brachial artery.

521 CONNECTION WITH THE BRAIN. The deep connection or origin of these nerves is still in some cases a matter of considerable uncertainty. Where they can be followed, the fibres may be traced to, and probably in part arise from, certain col- lections of grey substance termed “nuclei.” These nuclei are further connected by other fibres with each other and with the cerebral hemi- spheres. The deep origin of the first or olfactory nerves is still doubt- ful ; the second pair are connected chiefly with the optic thalami and corpora quadrigemina; the third and fourth with a nucleus deeply placed beneath the corpora quadrigemina ; the remainder with a con- tinuous series of collections of grey matter which lie beneath the floor of the fourth ventricle and in the central part of the medulla oblongata, around the central canal, as low down as the decussation of the pyramids.

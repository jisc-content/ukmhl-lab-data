185 GENERAL MORPHOLOGY OF THE MUSCLES. for a man of 150 lbs. weight: skeleton, 27 lbs.; muscles, 63 lbs. ; viscera (with skin, fat, blood, &c.), 60 lbs. General Morphology.—It cannot be doubted that the disposition of the muscles, as a whole and in groups, originally bears a close relation to the plan of vertebrate organization in the skeleton. This is very perceptible in the earlier stages of fcetal development and in the lowest vertebrate animals. In fishes especially, and partly in amphibia, the muscles present a remarkable degree of vertebrate segmentation, the greater part of the muscles of the trunk being subdivided into zones, or myotonies, by partitions or sclerotomes, partly bony and partly cartilaginous or membranous, which extend transversely through the walls of the trunk, and which correspond in number and position with the vertebral and costal segments. In the higher animals and in man, together with the greater specialization of muscles in connection with the development of limbs, great deviations from the primitive muscular type in the trank have occurred, and it becomes extremely difficult to trace the morphological relations of the rest of the muscles in the axial part of the body. It is indeed only in the deeper muscles of the vertebral column and of the ribs that the vertebrate subdivision and relation remain in any degree apparent. In the more super- ficial muscles, and more especially in the muscles of the limbs, where the direc- tion of the fibres is generally outwards from the trunk, portions of the myotonies ran together so as to form muscles of greater or less length, and in which all appearance of vertebrate division is effaced. In their more general relations also to the trunk of the body two sets of the muscles may be distinguished as epaxial and hypaxial (episkeletal and hyposkeletal of Huxley), according as they lie above or below the embryonic vertebral axis and the plane of its lateral extension. The hypaxial muscles, comparatively little developed in man, com- prise chiefly the prevertebral muscles of the neck with the psoas and pyriformis. Of the epaxial muscles a dorso-lateral division consists mainly of the long and short erector muscles of the spine and head ; while a vcntro-latcral division con- sists both of such ventral longitudinal muscles as genio-hyoid, sterno-hyoid, and recti abdominis, and of the lateral, obliquely directed, sterno-mastoid, scalene, intercostal, and abdominal muscles. The muscles of the limbs are also primarily derived from this great ventro-lateral muscle. They may be distinguished as extrinsic when attached partly to the limbs and partly to the trunk, and as -intrinsic when wholly attached to the bones of the limbs and their arches. To these morphological relations further reference will hereafter be made under the several large divisions of the muscles.

Animals,' and Mivart, “ Lessons in Elementary Anatomy.” Varieties.—It follows from what has been stated above, that homologous correspondence can be traced between the individual muscles and groups of muscles of man and those of animals. But as the form and attachments of the muscles are subject to very great variations in different animals, as well as to occasional varieties in the same species, the determination of the special homo- logies is attended in many cases with great difficulty, and is still very imperfect. Many varieties have also been observed in the human body, and it is interesting to notice that these varieties are found to reappear generally in the same form, i oi in modifications of it which indicate relations to a typical or fundamental i structure; and that many of them are thus more or less repetitions of forms | known to exist in different species of the lower animals.

The terra Fascia is applied to parts presenting a membranous dispo- sition of reticyilafcd or felted fibrous tissue. These structures have usually been distinguished as the superficial and the deep; the former consisting of looser and finer material, and passing by their slenderer

BONES OF TIIE LOWER LIMB. 10G The axis of the pelvis is the name given to a line drawn at right angles to the planes of the brim, cavity and outlet, through their ig. 94.—Vertical median SECTION OK A FEMALE PeL- vis (reduced from Niigele’s figure). | 1, symphysis pubis ; 2, pro- montory of the sacrum ; 3, coccygeal hones ; 4, anterior superior spine of ilium ; 5, tuberosity of ischium ; 6, spine of ischium (the obtura- tor foramen is not represented so pointed below as it gener- ally is in females). The ver- tical and horizontal lines in the lower part of the figure will assist the eye in judging of the degree of inclination of the pelvis, as illustrated by the next figure. central points. The pos- terior wTall, formed by the sacrum and coccyx, being about five inches Fig. 94. long and concave, while the anterior wall at the symphysis pubis is only one and a half or two inches long. The axis is curved; it is directed at the inlet upwards and forwards towards the umbilicus, and at the outlet downwards and a little forwards.

Differences according to Sex.—The size and form of the pelvis differ remarkably in the two sexes. In the female the constituent bones are more slender and less marked Fig. 95. with muscular impressions; the perpendicular depth is less, and the breadth and capacity greater ; the ilia are more expanded than in the male; the inlet of the true

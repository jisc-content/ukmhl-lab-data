302 arteries of the heal and neck. immediately below the great cornu of the hyoid bone. From this point the artery curves forwards and downwards to the upper margin of the thyroid cartilage ; it then descends a short distance beneath the omo- hyoid, sterno-hyoid, and sterno-thyroid muscles, furnishing offsets to those muscles ; and, reaching the anterior surface of the thyroid body, Fig. 249.

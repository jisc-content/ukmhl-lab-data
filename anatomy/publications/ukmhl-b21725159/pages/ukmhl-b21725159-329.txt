THE DIAPHRAGM. 300 The fibres arise from the bodies of several of the upper lumbar vertebras by two thick crura ; from two arches on each side external to the bodies of the vertebrae, called ligamenta arcuata ; and from the ensiform cartilage and the cartilages of the six lower ribs. a. The crura arise by tendinous fibres aggregated into two bundles, from the first, second, and third lumbar vertebrae, and the interposed fibro-cartilages on the right side, and from the first and second ver- tebras on the left side. The tendons of both crura curve forwards and upwards so as to enclose the aorta in an arch between them and the bodies of the vertebrae ; their inner margins are united behind, so that they form a nearly complete fibrous ring or oval loop round that vessel. The muscular fibres of the crura, springing from those tendons in thick bundles, on each side of the aorta, diverge as they pass upwards to the central aponeurosis. The innermost fibres on each side decussate with those of the side opposite, those of the right usually lying anterior to those of the left, and, curving upwards, limit an opening for the transmission of the oesophagus, before ending in the central apo- neurosis.

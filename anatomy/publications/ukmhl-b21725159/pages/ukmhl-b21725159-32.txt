VERTEBRAL COLUMN. 12 processes are smaller than the superior, flat, nearly circular, looking downwards and slightly inwards. The posterior arch presents in the middle line a rough elevation, the rudiment of a spinous process. The rest of the arch is thick and round, but at its junction with the lateral masses, it is hollowed out superiorly, so as to form a smooth transverse groove, in which lie the vertebral artery and first spinal (sub-occipital) nerve. It is sometimes converted into a foramen by a small arch of bone, and corresponds to the notches of the other vertebrae. The transverse processes are larger and project further outwards than those of the subjacent vertebrae. They are flattened from above down- wards, and have the foramen for the vertebral artery at their roots. Their extremities are not bifid, but broad and rough. The Second Vertebra.—-Axis (vert, dentata) forms a pivot on which the head with the first vertebra rotates. The body is characterised by the presence of a large blunt or tooth- like process called odontoid (proc. dentatus). This consists of an enlarged part termed the head, and a lower part Fig. 7. or neclc. It presents in front a smooth surface for articulation with the atlas, and behind a smooth groove to receive the The lower surface B transverse ligament. Fig. 7.—The Axis Vertebra. (A. T.)

Its anterior surface presents a low median vertical ridge, with a depression on each side. The superior articular surfaces placed like those ol the atlas in front of the notch, lie close to the base of the odontoid process, partly on the body and partly on the arch of the vertebra. These sui faces loo v upwards and slightly outwards. The inferior articular processes axe similar in form and position to those of the succeeding veite nie. The spinous process is very large, rough, deeply bifid, and grooved on its inferior surface. The laminae are very thick and stiong. The transverse processes are short and scarcely grooved and bifurcated. The foramen for the vertebral artery is inclined obliquely downwards Dorsal Vertebrae.—These are twelve in number, and support the The body as seen from above is somewhat heart-shaped ; its anteio- posterior and transverse diameters are nearly equal. It is specially characterised by the presence, at the place where it joins the arch, of depressed articular surfaces for the heads of i lbs. I

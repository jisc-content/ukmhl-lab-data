THE COSTO-SPINAL ARTICULATIONS. 141 to that below. In the first, eleventh, and twelfth ribs, this ligament is inserted into only one vertebral body, and into no fibro-cartilage. The interarticular liga- ment is a thin and short band of fibres, which passes trans- versely from the ridge separating the two articular surfaces on the head of the rib to the intervertebral substance, and divides the articli- ng. 126.—The 5th, 6in, 7m, 8th, and 9th Dorsal Vertebra, with PARTS OP THE 6TH, 7tH AND SHI Ribs, from the right side and FRONT. (A. T.) J The 9th rib has been removed to show the articular surfaces of the ver- tebra corresponding to it; 3 & 4, the heads of the 6th and 7th ribs, from which the stellate ligaments are seen spreading over the two adjacent verte- bral bodies and intervertebral substance; 5, the head of the 8th rib, from which the stellate ligament has been removed, so as to expose the upper and lower synovial cavities, and between them the interarticular ligament ; 6, lower, and 6', upper facet of the costo-central articulation ; 7, posterior eosto-trans- verse ligament; 7', the costo-transverse synovial cavity ; 7", the costo-transverse articular facet ; 8, superior costo-traDS- verse ligament; 9, superior articular process of the 5th vertebra ; 9', inferior of the 9tli.

The ligament does not exist in the articulations of the first, eleventh, or twelfth ribs, as these ribs are each attached to only one vertebral body by a single syno- vial joint. The COSTO-TRANSVERSE ARTICULATION unites the tubercle and neck of the rib to the corresponding transverse process by a synovial joint and ligaments, and by a longer ligament to the transverse process of the vertebra above. The posterior costo-transverse ligament is a distinct band extending outwards from the posterior part of the summit of the trans- verse process to the rough external part of the tubercle of the rib. The middle or interosseous costo-transverse ligament, consists of a series of short parallel fibres, which unite the neck of the rib to the anterior surface of the contiguous transverse process. These

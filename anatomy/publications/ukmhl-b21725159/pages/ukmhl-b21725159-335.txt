In front those three layers of muscle are replaced by tendinous expansions, which meet in the middle line; on either side of that line the fibres of the recti muscles extend in a vertical direction between the tendinous ■ layers, supported usually at the lower end by the pyramidales muscles. Posteriorly the wall is formed in part by aponeurosis, and in part by muscles of which the fibres are chiefly vertical, viz., the muscles of the back, and in front of them the quadratus lumborum.

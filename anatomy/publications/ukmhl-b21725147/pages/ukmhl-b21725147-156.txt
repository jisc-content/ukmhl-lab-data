The bundle is composed of pale nerve-fibres, with the exception of the fibre in, in, which is enclosed here and there by a thin medullary sheath ; n, n, nuclei of pale fibres. nerves. The branches of the olfactory nerve consist wholly of pale fibres, but these are different from the ordinary pale fibres in being provided with a distinct nucleated sheath.1 NERVE-CELLS. These are found in the grey matter of the brain and spinal cord and in the ganglia ; they exist also in some of the nerves of special sense near their termina- tions, and occur here and there in the course of certain other nerves. They are often named ganglion-cells. In shape, nerve-cells vary greatly. Thus they may be spheroidal or ovoidal with a general even outline, or they may be of an angular or irregular figure, and it is found that the nerve-cells have a characteristic shape in certain parts of the 1 On the structure of the non-medullated fibres of the sympathetic system, see a paper by I.

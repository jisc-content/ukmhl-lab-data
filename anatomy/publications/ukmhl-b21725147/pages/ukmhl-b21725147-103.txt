MINUTE STRUCTURE OF BONE. ‘263 sional occurrence of oval or flattened spheroidal bodies singly or in small groups near the border of the layers, each with a lacuna in the centre (fig. 305). In some parts the granular substance is obscurely fibrous, and transitions may be observed to the Fig. 304.—Magnified view of a perpendicular section through the external table of a HUMAN PARIETAL BONE, DECALCIFIED (H. Mttller). At a, perforating fibres in their natural situation ; at 6, others drawn out by separation of the lamella;; at c, the holes or sockets out of which they have been drawn (H. Muller). well-marked reticular laminae. The layers described appear principally to occur near the surface of the compact tissue, and at the circumference of many of the systems of concentric Haversian lamellae. Irregular layers of rounded bodies, apparently solid and without central cavity, are also sometimes seen, and are well represented in figure 306. These layers are Fig. 305.—Small part of a section THROUGH THE SHAFT OF A FEMUR (HUMAN, 16 TEARS) TAKEN A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE EPIPHYSIS. 230 DIAMETERS.

They can occasionally be recognised in a transverse section as short curvilinear bands of peculiar aspect, broader in the middle and thinning away at the ends, appear- ing here and there between the cut edges of two ordinary circumferen- tial laminae. I inally, spaces are occasionally seen in a section of bone, which are characterized by an eroded outline, but in some cases they may be partially filled up by concentric

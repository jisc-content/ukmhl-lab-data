HYALINE CARTILAGE. 247 becomes converted into fibro-cartilage, nor is it prone to ossify like rib-cartilage. But a deposit of calcareous granules may occur in the deeper parts of the articular, cartilage near the bone, the deposit first showing itself around the b Fig. 289.—From a section of costae cartilage from the calf.

As to those situated more inwardly, we can sometimes observe, in a transverse slice, that they form oblong groups disposed in lines radiating to the Fig. 287.—A thin layer peeled off from the surface of the cartilage of the head of the. ncMERUS, showing flattened groups of cells (Sharpey).

When the earthy matter is extracted by means of an acid, the tissue which remains has all the characters of cartilasre. o In the costal cartilages, the cells, which are of considerable size, are also collected in groups, larger for the most part than those found in articular cartilage (fig. 289). Near the exterior of the cartilage they are flattened, and lie parallel with

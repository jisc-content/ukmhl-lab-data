NERVES OF VOLUNTARY MUSCLES. dol araphibia (fig. 415), where there is no continuous granular bed with clear nuclei imbedded in°it, and the ramifications of the axis-cylinder are extended over a much larger proportionate area of the fibre than in reptiles, birds, and mammals, so that the termination of the nerve is far less localised. The branches of the axis- Fig. 414.—Termination op a nerve in A MUSCULAR FIBRE OF THE LIZARD (Lacerta viridis). (Ranvier.)

The granular substance lies in the intervals between the branches of the axis-cylinder; it is Aot seen in this figure. Fig. 415.—Nerve-ending in muscle of frog.

They have here and there slight enlargements, connected with which are seen, as in the end-plate of the lizard, granular pear-shaped nuclei (&), entirely different in appearance from the proper nuclei of the muscle (c). In other animals, e.c/., in snakes, there is a tendency for the branches of the ramification to become dilated at their termination into bulbous enlargements, which in a well-stained preparation gives an appearance like that of a bunch of berries. Many other variations are met with, but in no case is there a departure from the general rule that the ultimate

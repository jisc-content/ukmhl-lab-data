318 NERVE-CELLS. of pigment granules (fig. 372, b). The colour is deeper in adult age than in infancy. Every nerve-cell has one or more processes, and the cells are often named according to the number of processes they possess, uni-, bi-, and multi-polar ; terms not peihaps well chosen, but rendered current by use. A fibrillation similar to that in the axis-cylindei of a nerve-fibre is visible in the cell-processes, and it may also be tiaced passing fiom them into the body of the cell and even through this from Fig. 368.â€”Two nerve-cells from the spinal cord of the ox, isolated after maceration in VERY DILUTE CHROMIC ACID. MAGNIFIED 175 DIAMETERS. (E. A. S.) Each cell has a well-defined, clear, round nucleus, and a large nucleolus. The cell-processes are seen to be finely fibrillated, the fibrils passing from one process into another through the body of the cell. a, axis-cylinder process broken a short distance from the cell. one process into another (fig. 3G8). Some affirm that they have been able to trace a connection of these fibrils with the nucleus of the cell, but this is at present doubtful. Nerve-cells which are entirely destitute of processes have sometimes been described.. It is possible that such may exist, but there is always a probability that these may

BONE OK OSSEOUS TISSUE. 261. “ • !hcSe, Wey° named “ Haversian spaces” by Tomes and de Morgan, and they are interpolated or intruded amongst the regular Haversian systems, some of which may have been cut in upon in the excavation of the space. It was further noticed by Tomes and dc Morgan that the spaces in cpiestion may sometimes be seen being filled up at one part by the deposition of lamellm, whilst they are extending themselves by absorption at another. The Haversian spaces are most numerous in young and growing bones, but they occur also after growth is completed. The three appearances above mentioned are due to the peculiar manner in which the absorption of bone occurs ; for it is effected, as will presently be described, by , i Fig. 306.—Portion of a nodulated layer of bone-tissue from near the surface of the SHAFT OF A DECALCIFIED HUMERUS (Sharpey).

From a drawing by Allen Thomson. the agency of large multinucleated cells, which excavate little hemispherical pits (foveolae of Howship) in the osseous tissue. If the process of absorption should cease and should be succeeded by a re-deposition of osseous substance, the new osseous matter filling up the hollows of the absorbed surface exhibits, when it is detached, a raised impression corresponding with the hollows iuto which it fitted. In young bones the lamellar character is far less distinct than in adult bones, the tissue being constituted chiefly of bundles of fibres which interlace in every direction in the ground-substance ; in this reticular form of osseous tissue the lacunae are both more numerous and irregular than in lamellated bone. When tendons become ossified, as is often the case, especially in birds, little but a calcification of the ground-substance of the tendon occurs, so that, after decalci- fying, the tendinous structure again becomes manifest.

STRUCTURE OF SECRETING GLANDS. 4-00 ;r,La^bUlar,m+ Ciai;acter ; he Pr°P°ses accordingly to group them along with such glands as the kidney and testicles as compound tubular glands. But since, as Chievitz has shown the salivary and other similar glands, exhibit at an early condition of development a markedly sacculated character, the ultimate (tubular) alveoli being formed later as outgrowths of the saccules, whereas the tubular glands proper never exhibit this sacculated character it appears desirable still to recognise a morphological difference between the two classes of glands^ Fig. 458.—Simple saccular gland from the amphibian skin. (Flemming.) Fig. 459.—Simple tubular gland from the human intestine. (Flemming.) Fig. 460.—Diagram of small acinous gland formed of a simple “duct-system.” (Flemming.)

The acinous, racemose or acino tubular compound glands (fig. 457, C) are composed of a multitude of alveoli, opening in clusters into the extremities of a branched tube, named the excretory duct. The alveoli are saccular, pyriform or tubular. They are often rather filled than lined by secreting cells ; and are arranged in groups, round the commencing branches of the duct, with which their cavities are continuous (fig. 457, c). The ultimate branches of the duct open into larger branches (o), these into larger again, till they eventually terminate in one or more principal excretory ducts (m), by which the secretion is poured out of the gland. It is, as we have seen from the clustered arrangement of their ultimate recesses, that these glands arc named “ racemose ” or grape-like; and they, for the most part, have a dis-

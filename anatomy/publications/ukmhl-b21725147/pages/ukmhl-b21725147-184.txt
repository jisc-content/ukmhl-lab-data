TERMINATION OF SENSORY NERVES. <344 perineurium successively become continuous with, or rather expand into the tunics ol the corpuscle. Since, however, in most Pacinian corpuscles there are many more tunics in the corpuscle than layers of the perineural sheath which invests I*)g. 404.—Diagrammatic representation op two tunics op a Pacinian cor- puscle IN TRANSVERSE SECTION. a, a, epithelioid layers; b, b, connective tissue layer, more condensed near the sur- face ; c, open network of fine elastic fibres in the substance of the lamella. the entering nerve, it is only a few of the tunics which are thus con- tinuous ; and it will be generally found that it is the outer ones which are so. A certain number of the inner tunics are superadded therefore, and when traced towards the nerve-fibres they may be seen to end with rounded margins bounding a canal in which the nerve-fibre Fig. 405.—Pacinian corpuscle prom the mesentery of the cat; stained with nitrate of silver.

BLOOD-VESSELS. 374 reddish globules, which are now becoming disk-shaped (b), are found. Finally the cavity extends through the cell-processes into those of neighbouring cells and into those sent out from pre-existing capillaries (fig. 434, c), but a more or less extensive Fig. 433.—Commencing development of angioblastic connective tissue cells into blood-vessels. Fbom the subcutaneous tissue of the new-born rat. (E. A. S.) h, a cell containing haemoglobin in a diffused form in the protoplasm ; h', one containing coloured globules of varying size, and vacuoles ; 7i", a cell filled with coloured globules of nearly uniform size ; f, /', developing fat cells. Fig. 434.—Further development of connective tissue cells into capillary blood-vessels. (E. A. S.) a, an elongated cell with a cavity in its protoplasm occupied by fluid and by blood-corpuscles which are still globular ; b, a hollow cell the nucleus of which has multiplied. The new nuclei are arranged around the wall of the cavity, the corpuscles in which have now become discoid ; c, shows the mode of union of a “ haemapoietic ” cell, which in this instance contains only one corpuscle, with the prolonga- tion (fil) of a previously existing vessel, a, and c, from the new-born rat ; b, from the foetal sheep.

Young capillaries do not exhibit the veil- known lines when treated with nitrate of silver, for the differentiation of the hollowed

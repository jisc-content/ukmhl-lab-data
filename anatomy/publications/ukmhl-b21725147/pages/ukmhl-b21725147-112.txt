272 BONE OR OSSEOUS TISSUE. OSSIFICATION IN CARTILAGE. It has already been stated that, in by far the greater number of bones the mesodermic tissue with closely packed cells, of which they originally consist, is very quickly succeeded by cartilage, in which the ossification begins. One of the long bones taken from a very small embryo, just before ossification has commenced Fig. 310.—Humerus of a FffiTUS, NATURAL SIZE. (Sharpey.) The upper part is divided longitudinally, a, cartilage, b, line of junction of bone and cartilage. The perios- teal bone looks lighter than the endochondral bone pro- per.

The cartilage cells in the centre are enlarged and separated from one another by dark-looking calcified matrix ; im, layer of bone deposited underneath the periosteum : o, layer of osteoblasts by which this layer has been formed. Some of the osteoblasts are already embedded in the new bone as lacuna;. The cartilage-cells are becoming enlarged and flattened and arranged in rows above and below the calcified centre. At the ends of the cartilage the cells are small and the groups are irregularly arranged ; the fibrous periosteum is not sharply marked oil' from the cartilage. in it, is observed to be distinctly cartilaginous. In the tibia of a sheep, for example, at a time when the whole embryo is not more than an inch and a quarter in length, we can plainly see that the substance consists of cartilage-cells imbedded in a pellucid matrix. These cells can scarcely be said to be collected into groups, and are veiy irregular in size and shape. They become enlarged in the middle part of

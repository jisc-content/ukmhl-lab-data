277 OSSIFICATION IN CARTILAGE. —SKtit IWSCSSS'S'-^ Fig. 316.—Small portion op a section op developing bone, taken at the junction op the BONE AND CARTILAGE, AND EXAMINED IN THE FRESH CONDITION. MAGNIFIED ABOUT 140 DIAMETERS. (Sharpey.) a, b, two of the new-formed osseous tubes or areolae, with a few shrunken cartilage-cells lying in them; c, cartilage-cells near the ossifying surface, large and clear and filling the cavities in the matrix ; on the left of the figure some of them are shrunken. Fig. 317.—Part op a longitudinal section op the developing femur op the rabbit. Drawn under a magnifying power op 350 diameters (from Klein and Noble Smith). a, rows of flattened cartilage-cells ; b, greatly enlarged cartilage-cells close to the advancing bone, the matrix between is partly calcified ; c, cl, already formed bone, the osseous trabecuke being covered with osteoblasts (e), except here and there, where a giant-cell or ostoclast (/), is seen, eroding parts of the trabeculse ; g, h, cartilage-cells which have become shrunken and irregular in shape. From the middle of the figure downwards the dark trabeculae, which are formed of calcified cartilage matrix, are becoming covered with secondary osseous substance deposited by the osteoblasts. The vascular loops at the extreme limit of the bone are well shown, as well as the abrupt disappearance of the cartilage-cells. deposit takes place in the same way as in the formation of a membrane bone. Bony spicules prolonged by bunches of osteogenic fibres (fig. 318) project out from the previously formed layer, into the intervals between the blood-vessels. By the union of the spicules the vessels become in like manner enclosed in channels whose walls are gradually thickened by deposits of osseous substance, between which some of

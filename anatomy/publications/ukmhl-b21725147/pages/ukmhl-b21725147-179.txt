The arrangement of the cells in these corpuscles seems to vary con- siderably. Sometimes they are chiefly collected at the exterior, leaving the part A B C Fig. 398.—A and B, Genital corpuscles from the clitoris of the rabbit (Izquierdo) ; C, the human clitoris (W. Krause). from traversed by the axis-cylinder free from cells and of an obscurely fibrous appearance, concentrically striated in transverse section (G. Retzius); but in others there is an agglomeration of cells in the centre, as in the spheroidal end-bulbs of the human conjunctiva ; this is, however, denied by Retzius.

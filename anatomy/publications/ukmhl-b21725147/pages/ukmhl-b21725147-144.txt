304 CARDIAC MUSCULAR TISSUE. CARDIAC MUSCULAR TISSUE. The fibres of the heart (figs. 349, 350) differ remarkably from those of in- voluntary muscular organs in general, inasmuch as they present transverse strife 1 he strife, however, are less strongly marked, and less regular, and the fibres are smaller in diameter than in the voluntary muscles. They differ also from these in being made up of distinct quadrangular cells (fig. 349) joined end to end and often presenting a branched or forked appearance near one extremity (c). Each cell has a Fig. 349.—Six muscular fibre-cells from the heart, magnified 425 diameters. (E. A. S.) a, line of junction between two cells ; b, c, branching of cells. From a drawing by Mr. J. E. Neale. Fig. 350.—Muscular fibres from the heart, magnified, showing their cross stri.e, divisions, and junctions. (Scbweigger-Seidel.) The nuclei and cell-junctions are only represented on the right-hand side of the figure. single clear oval nucleus situate near the centre ; occasionally two nuclei are seen. The cell substance is striated longitudinally as well as transversely, its substance appearing to be composed of a number of parallel columns (sarcostyles), which on transverse section are seen as small polygonal areas.

The muscular fibres of the heart freely divide aud anas- tomose (fig. 350), the junc- tions with neighbouring fibres being effected by the medium of the cell-offsets above noticed. In the frog and lower vertebrata generally the muscular fibres of the heart are formed of elongated spindle-shaped cells, resembling in shape the cells of plain mus- cular tissue, but exhibiting distinct transverse striation.

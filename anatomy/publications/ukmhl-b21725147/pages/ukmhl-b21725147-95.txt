MINUTE STRUCTURE OF BONE. ~oy or less de°ree, and that the difference between the two varieties of tissue depends on the different amount of solid matter compared with the size and number of the open spaces in each; the cavities being very small in the compact parts of the bone, with much dense matter between them ; whilst in the cancellated texture the spaces are lar^e and the intervening bony partitions thin and slender. There is, accord- ingly, no abrupt limit between the two,—they pass into one another by degrees, the ■cavities of the compact tissue widening out, and the reticulations of the cancellated Fig. 295.—Longitudinal section through the upper end op the femur shotting the cancellous STRUCTURE OF THE HEAD AND THE COMPACT SUBSTANCE OF THE SHAFT. (Frond a photograph by Zaaijer.) becoming closer as they approach the parts where the transition between the two takes place. In all bones, the part next the surface consists of compact substance, "which forms an outer shell or crust, whilst the spongy texture is contained within. In a long bone, the large round ends are made up of spongy tissue, with only a thin coating of com- pact substance (fig. 295) ; in the hollow shaft, on the other hand, the spongy texture is scanty, and the sides are chiefly formed of compact bone, which increases in thickness from the extremities towards the middle, at which point the girth of the bone is least, and the strain on it greatest. In tabular bones, such as those of the skull, the compact tissue forms two plates, or tables, as they are called, inclosing between them the spongy texture, which in such bones is usually named dipice. The short bones, like the ends of the long, are spongy throughout, save at their

This floor is composed of a muscle which has somewhat the shape of an arch; it is called the diaphragm, and helps to contract and en- large the chest in inspiration and expiration, that is, when we take in or breathe out air.

The next and last cavity is the abdomen, still more imperfect as regards its bony walls, except at its upper and lower parts. Imme- diately under the diaphragm are placed, nearly in the centre, the stomach, on the right side the liver, and on the left side the spleen.

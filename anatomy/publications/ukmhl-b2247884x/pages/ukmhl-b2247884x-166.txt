THE PHYSICIAN. 160 illness ;—and then, if he is exposed to the infec- tion of fever, or of the cholera, he is sure to be attacked with it, and pretty sure to die. There were in a particular part of India to which the cholera came, two companies of sol- diers ; one of three hundred, one of one hun- dred. The company of one hundred agreed to live temperately and to avoid the night air : and only one man caught the cholera. The company of three hundred made no such agreement., but went on as usual, and thirty of them died*. Let him who reads this page, then, remem- ber, when he lifts the glass to his mouth, that if it raises his spirits for an hour or two, it shortens his life by many hours :—that a man who borrows life and spirits and strength from strong drink, is like a man who borrows money, and must pay it back with interest by and bye:—and if he has unhappily fallen into a habit of drinking much, let him resolve to drink much less ; nay, if he is in the habit of drinking ever so little beyond the point of need- ful refreshment, let him be sure that he had bet- ter drink less than that, than drink more. Fewer women have died of cholera than men, fewer children than women, and fewer sober men than drunkards. If a man’s natural spirits and strength are habitually exhausted by artificial stimulants, his stock of spirits and strength will be so taken up beforehand, that if the cholera makes a sudden demand upon this stock, even his life must go towards the payment. * Kennedy, p. 91, from tke Indian Reports.

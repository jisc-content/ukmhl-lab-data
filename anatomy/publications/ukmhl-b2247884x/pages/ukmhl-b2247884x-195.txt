TREATMENT OF CHOLERA. 189 member, too, that there is often no visible dis- ease of the stomach or bowels after death, and that when there is any, it is of an inflammatory character—that the heart and the large blood- vessels, and the vessels of the lungs, and the liver, and the brain, are full of black blood, and that the vessels of the skin are apparently empty. All this being in the mind, or the leading parts of it—when a friend or neighbour is un- doubtedly attacked with this fierce disease—• what is to be done ? Rules of treatment laid down in a book are always general. Good sense must still govern their application. But, generally speaking, the best thing that can be done in the first hurry is to get some warm and comfortable drink pre- pared—hot brandy and water is the best of all —to place a good blanket close to the fire, until it is quite warm—to undress the patient from head to foot, before a fire too—to let him drink his brandy and water, whilst his feet, legs, hands, and arms are briskly rubbed,—and then to roll him completely up to the chin in the hot blanket. Even his head should be warmly covered up; only leaving him room to breathe. In all this there is nothing required (except the brandy) which is not to be found or which may not be managed in any house or cottage. Hot tea, or even hot water, if there is no brandy to be got, will be better than nothing ; if the patient can keep it down. But when the cholera is expected, everybody ought to buy or beg a little brandy, and keep it as a valuable medicine.

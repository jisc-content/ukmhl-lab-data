THE PHYSICIAN. 190 Laudanum, again, is a dangerous thing to have in the house at all times, for children or ignorant persons may drink it by mistake. But those who live far from medical advice should have a little bottle of laudanum by them. Laudanum is opium dissolved in proof spirit. Opium is the dried and thickened juice which flows when incjsions are made in the head of the white poppy, cultivated for the sake of opium in some of the countries of which we have been speaking, as India and Persia. We get opium from India and from Turkey; that which comes from the latter country is the strongest: theTurks are in the habit of taking it in large quantities to produce a kind of intoxication. Taken in a small quantity (a quarter of a grain) it produces excitement; in a larger dose (one or two grains) it allays pain, and produces sleep ; and, in a still larger, it puts an end to life. In many spas- modic diseases it is given freely, without pro- ducing the bad effects which it would if given in the same quantity to a person in health. The solution of opium in spirit, or laudanum, is the best form of the medicine for a cholera patient, as it is in that form most likely to act on the stomach without delay. The usual dose of lau- danum is from ten drops to forty. In a case of cholera thirty or forty drops should be given at first in the brandy and water. If the edge of the laudanum bottle is made wet on one side, it will be easy to drop it out, drop by drop, into an empty glass ; if it runs out too fast, the drop- ping must be done over again, until done pro- perly.

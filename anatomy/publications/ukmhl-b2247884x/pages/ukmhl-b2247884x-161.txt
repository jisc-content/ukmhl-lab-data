SPASMODIC CHOLERA IN ENGLAND. 155 after being appointed with Dr. Russell and others to form a second or a central Board of Health in London, went to Sunderland; and set the question of the nature of the disease at rest by declaring- that it was the very same disease which he had seen at St. Petersburg. In Sunderland, as in almost every other place in which the cholera has appeared since it first appeared at Jessore, the first persons attacked were either sea-faring- persons, or those engaged in traffic. More of the poor have died than of those better clothed and better fed; and more of the intemperate than the sober. The number of victims has been less in proportion to the number of cases than in the towns of the Con- tinent, or of Persia and Arabia, or of India. These particulars, also, are interesting; because we gather from them the probable course and consequences of cholera in other parts and towns of England, all of which may possibly be visited in turn. The cholera is now at Newcastle, at Shields, and in the neighbourhood of those places, pro- ceeding very slowly, but still steadily proceeding. We have spoken of a wise fear, which leads to the means of safety and protection. These means must be sought by a consideration of the history and progress of the danger that is ex- pected. Such progress and such a history hav- ing been given in the preceding pages,—what is it that we learn from them ?—and what means of safety and protection are to be adopted ?— Let us reflect on what has taken place, that we may learn what we ought to do.

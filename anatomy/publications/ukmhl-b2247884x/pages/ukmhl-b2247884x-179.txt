HOW TO ESCAPE THE CHOLERA. 173 who are of necessity exposed much to cold and moisture, all who live in cold damp houses or situations, and all who have irritable bowels, soon disturbed by changes of weather, should wear flannel next the skin. A long flannel waistcoat with sleeves, and even flannel drawers, will be found the best means of preserving their health, and of guarding them against spasmodic attacks in the stomach and bowels, and even against the cholera. If the expense of a flannel waistcoat is any obstacle, (it cannot cost more than a few shillings ; from two shillings to four at the utmost,) or if a waistcoat of flannel should be found uncomfortable, a flannel band should be worn round the bowels, at least eight inches broad; and the women should wear wide, full, warm, and old-fashioned flannel petticoats. They say that the Dutch, whose broad figures amuse us so much in pictures, are seldom or never troubled with coughs and colds*. Their houses are cold, and their love of cleanliness is so great that they are perpetually washing and scouring their rooms : the climate of Holland, too, is damp and chill: but the Dutch women wear thick warm stockings, and at least half a dozen good substantial petticoats : whilst the men wear clothing equally thick, including almost as many waistcoats as we have seen the grave-digger take off one after the other in the play of Hamlet. Although it might be some time before we English people should like to see our wives and daughters as shapeless as the Dutch, both we and they might still borrow part of the dress of * fieddoes.

THE PHYSICIAN. 52 taught eye would see little or no departure from the appearance of health. If the doctor of a regiment in India, at a time when cholera is prevailing, sees any man on the parade with an expression of distress or anxiety in his face, or looking hollow-eyed, or of a dirty earthy colour, such colour not being natural to him, he often sends him off to the hospital at once ; for these slight alterations of appearance are the very first signs of the coming of cholera. It is not often, indeed, that a man looks in this way without feeling himself a little out of order. If he is not absolutely sick, he is uncomfortable. His hands and feet are cold, his nails look blue, he complains of heat at the pit of the sto- mach, and his bowels are commonly disturbed. This disorder of the bowels (diarrhoea, or purging) has a particular character, for the bowels are violently moved, as if they were completely emptied at once, and the patient feels very weak. Fear makes people quicksighted ; those who know nothing of medicine, soon learn, if in India, to know the look of a man whose health is going wrong. An officer sees something odd about the appearance or manner of his servant: the man looks ill, and is a little deaf; but on closer examination by a doctor, the poor man is found to be colder than usual, his pulse is very much sunk, his bowels are not right, and he soon becomes dangerously ill.

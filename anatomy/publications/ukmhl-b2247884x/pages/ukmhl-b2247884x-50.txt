Happily, however, experience has taught us many means of mitigating, and even to a cer- tain extent, of avoiding, the effects of the un- known agent. By extensive improvements in cities and in modes of life, some of the worst effects are now very rarely seen in our country; and others unknown among us are mitigated, where they are yet known, by the science which medical practitioners carry into other climates. Even the common disorders of measles and the scarlet-fever, which used to be, in certain years, almost as destructive as the plague, are now so far controlled by proper management, * The ague belongs to a class of diseases called endemic, being partial as to place; and the causes of endemic diseases are commonly pretty well understood. Some endemic disorders, however, as the swelled neck or goitre, or bronchocele, as it is called by medical writers, depend upon causes about which there is yet much difference of opinion. The swelled neck chiefly prevails in the low and damp vallies of mountainous districts ; as in the Alps, which divide Italy from France and Switzerland ; in the Pyrenees, which divide France from Spain ; and in Derbyshire and other hilly parts of England,

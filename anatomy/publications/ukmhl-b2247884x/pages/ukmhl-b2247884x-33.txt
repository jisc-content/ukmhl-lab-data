21 INTRODUCTION. where, by the operation of bile received from the liver, and of other secretions, including a bland secretion from the pancreas, it is changed into chyle. As the chyle is slowly passed along the many windings of the small intestines, by the successive contraction of all the portions of them, throughout the whole of their folds, a space equal to many feet in length, it is taken up or absorbed by certain vessels which open into the intestines, called, from the colour of their contents, lacteals (from lac, milk), and by them carried into a larger vessel, called the thoracic duct, which runs up by the side of the spine as high as the neck, and there pours its contents, as a new supply, into the veins, which carrying it, mixed with the blood they contain, to the right side of the heart, it becomes, there and in the lungs, min- gled more intimately with the blood, or rather converted entirely into blood, to be circulated through the arteries and veins with the rest. This supply, it has been said, is intended to make up for the waste or expenditure of blood, incurred by the formation of various secretions, and by the renewal of all the structures of the body. In the body, as, in- deed, throughout all the works of nature, nothing is at complete rest. Even the greatest and most solid masses of which the earth is composed are undergoing a slow but silent change.

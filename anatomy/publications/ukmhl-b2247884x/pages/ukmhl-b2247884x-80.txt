THE PHYSICIAN. 74 description of the Indian climate, that the two circumstances of great heat, and tracts of coun- try liable to occasional inundation, and then to a gradual process of drying, are frequently conjoined. The broad-extending branches of the Ganges are seen to spread far over the map ; and this river alone, after it has left the mountains, in which it pursues a course of several hundred miles, receives eleven rivers into its waters, none of them smaller than the river Thames. The difference be- tween the wet and dry season is such, that a house may be on the banks of the Ganges at one time, and left, in the dry season, two miles away from it. The soil, too, is scattered and mingled thickly with the remains of a vegeta- tion far more abundant than what we know in temperate climates, and also with the re- mains of innumerable insects and reptiles. We see, in our own climate, that whenever we have a certain degree of heat acting upon a rank luxuriance of soil, decayed vegetable matter, and the remains of the numerous in- sects which abound in damp places and sea- sons, we have agues produced, or other fevers, or dysenteries, or even cholera; in fact the very diseases of India, though less severe, less rapid in their course, and less fatal. We may imagine the extent of such effects under what has been called the ‘ hot and copper sky ’ of India.

29 INTRODUCTION. tor, which receives and transmits to the brain the sense of colours. By means of other nerves, the desires, or the will, which are formed in the brain, communicate their inten- tions to the muscles, and the muscles contract in obedience to the commands thus sent to them. These, however, form probably but a small part of the functions of the various parts of the brain, some of which may be more intimately concerned than they are yet known to be in the government of different kinds of motion, and of the circulation and secretion. The nerves of the body proceeding from the brain, and from the spinal marrow, which is con- nected with the brain, and another system of nerves in the interior of the body, sometimes called the sympathetic system, being connected with all the rest, are so very numerous, and so variously conjoined, that without drawings or preparations, which are to be seen in museums and in books of anatomy, no descrip- tion of them could he understood. As every organ is supplied with blood-vessels, so also every organ is supplied with branches of nerves. How universally the surface of the body is supplied with nerves of sensation may be known by the pain that may everywhere be produced by slight causes. We know that a connexion with the brain is necessary to the continued functions of the nerves by this, among other proofs, that if the connexion is severed, the function of the nerve ceases. We know that there are nerves for sensation, and nerves for motion; for we can

PROGRESS OF CHOLERA. Ill old neglected town: the very air seems to become poisoned, and everybody falls sick. In one case the disease seems to spread from one to another for months: in the other, two or three are attacked, and the rest escape. Now if such cities as Benares, and indeed all dirty, crowded, ill-ventilated cities, whether in Asia or in Europe, were made cleaner, and purer, and cleared of idle, useless, and filthy persons and if, at the same time, all the un- wholesome spots of ground, jungle and jeel, and wild forest and marsh, were brought under proper cultivation,—many of the diseases which vex and destroy mankind would be put an end to; or if still heard of, would but attack a tew persons, and seldom spread from city to city, destroying hundreds and thousands of people. The small-pox first came to Europe from the crowded and dirty cities of China • just as the cholera came from Bengal. And’ perhaps it may be said that if the people of bunderlaud had not been, in some parts of the town at least, notoriously negligent of cleanli- ness, and of improvident and intemperate habits the cholera itself would possibly never have found a footing on English ground. What is of importance to one town is of import- ance to all towns Whilst any are ignorant and neglected, all must be exposed to danger Knowledge and industry and cleanliness even change, not only the constitution of man, but the very nature of the air which he breathes.

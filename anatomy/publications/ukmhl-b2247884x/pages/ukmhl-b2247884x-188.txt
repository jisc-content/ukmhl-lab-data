182 THE PHYSICIAN. all that is required; and if too much is said about such measures before they become neces- sary, it leads to needless alarm, and may even cause the concealment of the disease until too late for the safety of the patients or their neigh- bours. These precautions, which may become neces- sary, should not be placed in such a light as to create a panic for which there are no reason- able grounds. They are only mentioned now to show, that in case of the worst that can happen people will not be left to perish for want of care. In closely built towns, where cholera may be expected to be very fatal, it will possibly be pro- posed that the sick should always be removed to hospitals prepared for cholera patients. This measure is often a very welcome one ; for the person removed gets better attended to than he could be at home. But if the friends object to its being done, it ought not to be done ; for by proper care at home those in the house may either be preserved from the disease, or their neighbours protected against it. The friends must in this case submit to be kept within cer- tain limits, and to be debarred from going into other personsâ€™ houses until all fear of infection has passed away, which it cannot be in a shorter period than a few weeks. The houses in which persons were ill of cho- lera would, perhaps, in such circumstances, be supplied with all things necessary by persons appointed to leave them at their doors : and they would be carefully attended by medical men especially appointed to that duty.

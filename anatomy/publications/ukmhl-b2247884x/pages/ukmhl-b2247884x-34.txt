This slight survey of some of the functions of the body is sufficient to show how very im- portant is the assistance given by the organs of respiration and of circulation to those of digestion and nutrition ; and this may serve to illustrate that inseparable chain of connexion which was before alluded to. There is, however, yet one very important part of the human body to be spoken of, which is commonly called the Nervous System.

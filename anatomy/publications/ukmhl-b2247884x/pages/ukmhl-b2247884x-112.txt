THE PHYSICiAtf. 106 to expect cold weather to put a stop to the cholera. Notwithstanding these remarks, however, it must never be forgotten that it began in India, and that in hot countries it has been most fatal in hot seasons. Some observers have thought that the great heat of the houses in Russia, kept warm by stoves, made the malady more prevalent than it would otherwise have been in that cold climate. In its passage, also, to Russia, the places which it visited were many of them certainly, and probably all of them, the most favourable for its invitation and for spreading it. As it proceeded through Georgia, for instance, it appeared at Tifflis, from whence the fear of it did but precede its course into Russia. The heat of Tifflis in the summer is described as intolerable, the thermometer beiag occasionally as high as 118 degrees of Fahren- heit in the shade. The streets are very nar- row ; the houses have no glazed windows; the public markets, the baths, the river, and indeed the whole town, are in the utmost degree dirty and offensive. It is situated between a muddy river and a high mountain, amidst parched fields and barren hills. Jessore, where the cholera first appeared in 1817, is crowded, dirty, badly ventilated, and in the midst of marsh and jungle. The poor people of Calcutta are badly fed and miserably lodged, exposed to heat by day, and to bad air by night in close and wretched hovels, round which there is often much stagnant and offen- sive water.

DESCRIPTION OF CHOLERA. 63 state of the blood, and the weakness of the heart, think death arises from a want of the proper changes going on in the lungs, by which (as has been mentioned in the Introduc- tion) the blood in the veins is rendered fit to go into the arteries ; others, considering the scanty state of the urine, have even fancied cholera was a disease very much connected with some disorder of the kidneys. If any one of these changes invariably hap- pened Jirst, and the rest followed, we might believe such first change to have a great deal to do with the disease; but all the changes take place at once, or at least are always very speedily effected. The heart is weakened, and the stomach and bowels are disturbed, and the bile and urine are suppressed, and the blood in the veins ceases to be properly changed in the lungs, either all at one time, or so nearly so that we cannot say which is first. A patient affected with cholera is, in fact, under the influence of a poison, communicated to him from the air, and at once so strongly affecting his brain and nerves, and his heart, that no action in the body can possibly go on well.

OF DISEASES FROM STATES OF THE AIR. 43 especially the kind of fever called ague, is very evident. It is generally believed that, in all these cases, whether of fever, yellow-fever, plague, or ague, it is neither heat alone, nor moisture alone, nor any variety of either, nor any com- bination of both, that is solely concerned in their production. Something hurtful is sup- posed to be added to the usual air,â€”something hurtful, but which science has not yet succeeded in detecting. It cannot be seen, or tasted, or touched, or smelt; it has neither palpable substance or colour.; but we believe that it exists, because of certain effects which we know not to arise from those parts of the air which we can see and examine. It is possible, although such a supposition is not countenanced by medical authorities, that the hurtful agent may, in all parts of the world, be one and the same; and that certain com- binations of temperature, moisture, and elec- tricity only give to fevers a variety of cha- racters at different seasons, in different parts of the same country, and in different climates: sometimes causing a difference in the character of the fever itself, sometimes directing the prin- cipal force of the disease to some particular internal organ, and sometimes throwing it out upon the surface. All that we can say at present is, that the varieties of the diseases called, from their par- tial prevalence as to time, epidemic, do not depend on any known changes in the consti-

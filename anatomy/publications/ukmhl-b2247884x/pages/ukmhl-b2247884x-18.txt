Along the front of the thigh there, is, for in- stance, a long and well defined muscle, called the rectus, or straight muscle, broader at its upper part, and gradually narrowing down into a tendon which ends at the knee: this muscle may be seen to act when the leg and foot are stretched forwards.

The tendon at the end, bearing or pulling up, on these and many other occasions, the whole weight of the body, is sometimes snapped asunder. The tendon itself is called the tendon of Achilles, because the mother of that ancient hero held him, it is said, when an infant, by the heel, whilst she dipped him in water which was to render him invulnerable. It would be impossible, without going much more into the description of the different muscles, to convey an idea of the great num- ber that are employed in the simple act of walking. How rapidly they may be moved, and with what exactness,may be perceived by any one who takes the trouble to watch the

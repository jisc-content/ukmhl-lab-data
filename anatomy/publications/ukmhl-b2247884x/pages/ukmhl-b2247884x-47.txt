OF DISEASES FROJI STATES OF THE AIR. 41 the yellow fever, so common in the West Indies, and so fatal to the troops sent from England, only prevails in those years when the heat has for some time remained steadily above the summer heat of our climate. It is for this reason, perhaps, that at certain heights, even in the climate in which yellow-fever prevails, it never appears. The height of about 1800 feet above the level of the sea seems to be its limit* ; but this has been accounted for by the supposed weight of the noxious air, or malaria, which keeps in the lower regions. On the other hand, the plague, which every year pre- vails on the eastern and southern shores of the Mediterranean sea, disappears as the summer advances; so that on a particular day, about Midsummer, a gun is fired by the Turks as a formal announcement of its departure. In other cases, there is every reason to ascribe disorders to circumstances closely con- nected with the moist air of marshy places. In some parts of Lincolnshire, and Cambridge- shire, and Essex, the ague, which is an inter- mitting fever, coming on every day, or every other day, or, in some cases, every third day, and consisting of three stages,—a shivering or cold stage, during which the patient is affected with violent and universal tremor ; a hot stage, in which his face becomes flushed, and he is sometimes delirious; and a sweating stage, with which the attack goes off;—is continually to be met with : and the parts of these counties where it is thus met with abound in marshes. * Humboldt.

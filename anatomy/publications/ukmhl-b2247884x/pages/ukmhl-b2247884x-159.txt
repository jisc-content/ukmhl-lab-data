SPASMODIP CHOLERA IN ENGLAND. 153 membrane always covered or bedewed with mucus or spittle ; and that first the influenza, and then all these cases of nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, dysentery, and English cholera, have kept one or other of these membranes in a state of irritability ever since the month of May. Even in the past month of December, on the very border of winter, the latter description of cases, usually limited to the months of July, August, and September, and to a short period of the season of spring, have been extremely pre- valent. The weather was generally, it is to be observed, very warm and showery. More than two months have elapsed since the true cholera, —which we have no longer any right to call the cholera of the East, except with reference to its origin—the true spasmodic cholera, made its appearance at Sunderland, and there it still re- mains. To Sunderland it appeared to come at the end of October from Hamburgh, a port on the opposite coast of the German Ocean; at which port it had appeared, first in the shipping, and then in a drunken pauper who had been begging on board the ships, and then in the cellar where the pauper died; and then in other places. The first case at Hamburgh was noticed on the 5th of October. Sunderland is a place of trade and shipping, from which the Newcastle coals are sent to the south of England in vessels. The inhabitants, most of whom depend for subsistence on the coal trade, dreaded that a know ledge of the cho- lera being among them would put a stop to this trade tor a time, and cause them great loss.

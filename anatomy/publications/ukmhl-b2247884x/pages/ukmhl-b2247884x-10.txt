8 THE PHYSICIAN. Cholera alone, as they will necessarily compre- hend observations connected with the preser- vation of the general health of working-men. To render even this subject at all intelligible, and to show that the advice given to the work- ing-man regarding his health is founded in reason, it is necessary to begin with a view —of course, a very brief view—of the structure and functions of the principal parts of the human frame. Such a prefatory explanation being essential to the comprehension of the causes and symptoms of maladies, forms also an appropriate introduction to the whole of the proposed work. In future volumes of ‘ The Physician,’ it is designed to treat more particularly, but with as much plainness as possible, of the structure and actions of different regions of the body,— as of the organs contained in the chest, in the abdomen, in the head,—and to describe the nature, the usual causes, and the general prin- ciples of the treatment of the diseases or acci- dents most frequently affecting each. The maladies occasioned by different occupations and trades may be usefully introduced into this plan ; for there is much reason to believe that the unwillingness with which workmen have availed themselves of the several con- trivances intended for their protection when engaged in work destructive to health, has sometimes arisen from their not clearly under- standing in what manner the hurtful agent to which they were exposed produced its bad effects upon them.

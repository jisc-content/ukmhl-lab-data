THE PHYSICIAN. 122 divides, in a great part of its course, Europe from Asia. Astrachan, where the cholera first presented itself, is seated on an island at the mouth of the river Volga, and is a port of great trade, with a population of about 20,000 people, and doubtless abounding, as all sea- ports do, with crowded, ill-ventilated, and dirty houses, and a negligent class of poor inhabitants. The banks of the Don, the river dow?i the course of which the cholera travelled, after travelling up the course of the Volga, are fertile in plants, and in many places covered with extensive low woods; and marshy places seem to be very common. The water-melon is much cultivated, and covers many acres of ground. There are also large uncultivated plains, called steppes in Russia, resembling the prairies of America, capable of tillage, but untilled: these are bleak and desolate in winter, but covered with herbage and flowers in summer, like a vast and wild meadow; the grass is never mown or meddled with, but is allowed to grow and to decayâ€” thus creating a kind of soil which if acted upon by equal heat, or liable to inundation, would in several respects resemble that of the banks of the rivers in India. One of these plains, above the Sea of Azof, into which the Don runs, is above 400 miles in length. On the eastern and western sides of the Don, near its mouth, there are marshes of great extent, which are liable to an annual inundation; numerous aquatic plants, and all the flies and insects

PROGRESS OP CHOLERA. 109 is a city of great trade; from the south of India diamonds are brought thither, muslins from the east, and shawls from the north, for sale: there are manufactories of silk, cotton, and fine woollen; and it is a great mart for English hardware, and other goods from Eu- rope.

So narrow and so wind- ing are the streets, that no wheel-carriage can pass through them; and the houses rise to a considerable height, and have many projecting verandas, windows, and galleries, and broad and overhanging eaves like the oldest streets of London, of which very few are now to be seen. Narrow as the streets are, and hardly wide enough to allow the proper circulation of air, they are also crowded in every part. Sacred bulls, as tame and familiar as dogs, tvalk lazily up and down, or lie about in the streets; and sacred monkeys are clinging to every roof, projection, and ornament, putting their heads and paws, without scruple, into every shop containing good things, and even taking food out of the hands of the little chil- dren. At the same time, both sides of the street are lined with beggars, most of them de- formed, and covered with chalk and cow-dung; and many of them preserving particular atti- tudes by way of penanceâ€”some walking on one eg, never using the other, which has become contracted for want of use; some holding out an arm in a painful position;

If a person who has not had the small-pox, and who has unfortu- nately not been vaccinated, comes into the same house with one who is lying ill of small- pox, he is almost sure to take the disease : but there is no such fear in a typhus fever ; which is only communicated to those who are a long time with the sick, and sit close to them, or inhale their breath ; and not always even then, let we have known whole families ill of typhus fever, and left to die, because no nurse would go near them.

THE PHYSICIAN. 188 skin; and the patients in whom this appeared commonly recovered. In cases of measles and small-pox in this country, where the eruption does not readily come out, convulsions some- times occur, which are ended by the breaking out of the eruption. These facts, put together, point to a mode of relieving the internal organs, by acting on the skin; and this is one of the points to be kept in view in the cholera. It would seem that much of the blood, or perhaps of the nervous energy also, which ought to be employed in the small vessels of the body, in- cluding those of the skin, is mis-directed to the muscles which form, as has been explained, one of the coats of the intestines, or to the nerves which govern their motions, and there produces irregular action and mischief. If we can draw it back again, to the small vessels of the skin, and of other parts, we shall relieve the muscles and their nerves, and the convulsions will pro- bably cease. But this is not all that we are required to do, —If we would understand how to manage a patient ill of cholera, we must consider how he is affected by it altogether. Let us remember that this is his state—that his skin is very cold —that the action of his heart is very weak— that for a time he has violent vomiting and purging—and then extreme depression—that sometimes the depression comes on before the vomiting and purging seem to have time to begin,—and that the depression may be so ex- treme and so rapidly brought on that the patient may die as if he were poisoned. Let us rc-

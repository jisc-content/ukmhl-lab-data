Such regulations are always very disagreeable to travellers, and are not observed with sufficient strictness, or for a sufficient length of time, to make them really useful. In the pursuit of gain, men become selfish enough to disregard the safety of a whole country, and even their own personal safety; and try every art to escape the quarantine laws themselves, and to convey the articles in which they deal from one country to another, without undergoing proper purification. The cholera soon showed itself in Austria as. well as in Poland ; and then the Prussian line of quarantine was extended to that side also. But with all their care they could not keep out the cholera. Very soon after its appearance' at Riga, it came to Dantzic; both of these are ports on the Baltic sea, and the latter is in- Prussia. People and vessels coming from Dantzic were then as rigorously dealt with as if they had come from Russia; but still without effect.

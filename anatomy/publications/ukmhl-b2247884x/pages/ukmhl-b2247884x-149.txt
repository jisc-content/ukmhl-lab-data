CHOLERA IN POLAND AND PRUSSIA. 143 So bad a fever prevailed at Potsdam during the late summer that it had been decided to make Charlottenburg the royal residence, and preparations were in consequence making at the time the first case of cholera appeared. The sub- ject of this case was a boatman, who had come to Charlottenburg the day before in a barge ; and as there was no doubt of the nature of the dis- ease, the King and Court set off immediately for Berlin.

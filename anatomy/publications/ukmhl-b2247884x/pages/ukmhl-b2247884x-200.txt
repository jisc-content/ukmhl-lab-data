In a feeble person, or when the dis- order has been present some hours, it will sel- dom be admissible, or even safe; and often very dangerous. The medical man can only be guided by the circumstances present in each particular case. The extreme debility which so soon ensues upon the symptoms of cholera must never be forgotten : slight circumstances may entirely de- stroy the patientâ€™s life: every violent impres- sion must be guarded against. The chance of good effects following bloodletting is greatest the earlier it is performed.

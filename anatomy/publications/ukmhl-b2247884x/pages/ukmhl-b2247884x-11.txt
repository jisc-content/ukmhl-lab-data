NOTICE. 9 Unlike the common books of popular me- dicine, so eagerly purchased by the poorer as well as richer classes of readers, this publica- tion is not meant to supersede an application of the sick to persons competent to cure them, but to show them that it is only in such per- sons that they can safely trust. It is as far from the intention of ‘ The Physician’ to en- courage an incautious use of medicines. By showing the tendency of different circum- stances or things to produce disease, and by explaining the nature of the diseases thus ex- cited, and the manner in which remedies are intended and may be expected to act, it is meant to produce greater caution in incurring the calamity of sickness, and more prompt ap- plication to skilful men, instead of reliance on ignorant and unprincipled persons, who, with fraudulent promises and impudent pretensions, gain the patronage of the rich, and often con- trive to obtain a large share of the honest earnings of the poor and uneducated, leaving them at last with empty pockets and a ruined constitution.

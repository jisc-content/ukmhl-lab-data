THE PIIYSICTAN. 12 and even without noise. We, who contemplate the skeleton, have within us the same bony supports, the same frame-work, the same scaffolding; yet we move without the least jar or disturbance; we walk, we run, we dance; the bones do not rattle or strike toge- ther, even in the leaps and contortions of a tumbler. The arm swings round, and the body bounds upon the feet, and all with- out noise or shock. This effect, so curious as well to deserve notice, although so common that its notice seems almost ridiculous, is pro- duced by soft substances introduced between the ends, or at the joints of those bones which are not firmly attached to each other. Where- ever there is a joint, there is this cushion pre- pared in some shape or other; and the cushion is elastic or springy, and kept continually moist. It no less exists at the joints of the fingers and toes than at those of the shoulder and thigh. Nowhere is it more beautifully seen than between the bones of the spine, of which, indeed, the separate bones, twenty- four in number, with the various muscles which move them, the various bending and turning movements they produce, and the complete security from injury either of the bones themselves or of the very important part they contain, namely, the spinal marrow, in all common, and in many uncommon movements, present an especial subject of wonder. There never was a machine invented answering so many useful ends, and performing so many actions, with so little wear and tear.

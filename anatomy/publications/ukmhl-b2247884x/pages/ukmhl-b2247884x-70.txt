The warmth, too, and the sensibility of the body are rapidly extinguished ; and the sensations so disordered, that whilst the skin has all the coldness of death, the stomach seems a prey to a consuming fire, or the whole body oppressed with a devouring heat. Medical men have not yet determined how the poison of cholera is introduced. It is some- times imagined that the skin affords a passage to it. But seeing that we continually breathe air, and that the air we breathe continually acts on the blood, it seems pretty clear, that if it is a poisoned state of air which produces cholera, the air thus poisoned must affect the blood in the lungs, and by so doing, by impairing its qualities, probably lead to disorder of every part of the body.

That the sto- mach and bowels become violently irritated, is plainly enough seen in the vomiting and diarrhoea; but whether this irritation is the consequence of disordered fluids being formed in the bowels, or whether these disordered

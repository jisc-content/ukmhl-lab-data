It is considered to exist, but is not so conspicuous, in the white races also. It is not easy to give a brief and yet a clear account of the functions performed by all these organs. The attempt lays a writer open to the charge of trying to make a royal road to knowledge. Yet something may be done for the instruction of those who have not time to study the subject more at large.

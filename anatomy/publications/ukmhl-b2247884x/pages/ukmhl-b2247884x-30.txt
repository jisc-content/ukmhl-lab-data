THE PHYSICIAN. 24 are called arteries; those which carry it back to the heart are called veins. The blood which is carried back by the veins is received into the auricle on the right side of the heart, from thence it is passed into the ventricle of the same side; from the ventricle it is driven through the lungs, where, by the air received at the same time by inspiration, it is changed from venous blood, of a dark colour, and unfit for the purposes of general supply, into arterial blood, of a florid colour, and fit to be circulated again. The blood is well known to be warm. Wherever blood flows freely, there is warmth ; whenever it flows slowly, there is less warmth. This warmth, or animal heat, is supposed partly to depend on the nerves, and partly on what takes place in the lungs. Very minute circumstances do not enter into the plan of this description, but there is a peculiarity worth observing in the circulation ' of the blood of the stomach, intestines, pan- creas, and spleen ; for the blood which is car- ried to these organs by their proper arteries does not return by direct veins, as from other parts, but is collected into a large vein, and carried by it to the liver, where the vein divides into many small branches, so as to cir- culate the blood which has already been to the stomach, intestines, pancreas, and spleen, through the liver also before it goes back to the heart. This is very curious, and will be seen to be important, as relates to some diseases. In future volumes of ‘ The Physician ’ an attempt will be made to explain, without the

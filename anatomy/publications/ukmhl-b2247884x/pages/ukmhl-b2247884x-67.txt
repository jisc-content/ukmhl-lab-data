description of cholera. 61 part of the chest quite empty, forming- a com- plete vacuum. The blood which the lungs contain is very black. The heart, and the great vessels which bring the blood to it and carry it away, are found dis- tended with blood; and this distension with dark or black blood is found both on the right side and on the left, in both the auricles and in both the ventricles. As might be expected from the violence of the disease, and its effects during life on the outward character of the body, those who have died of it often look like those who have died of a long and w'asting disorder. The general appearances after death, then, are a shrunken state of the surface, a gorged or very full and distended state of the large internal vessels, and of some of the internal organs; with more or fewer signs of disease in the stomach and bowels, and occasionally with collections of matter in them resembling that which was discharged by vomiting and purging during life. These seem to be but slight alterations to be found after so violent a disease. But the violence of the disease in some measure ex- plains the slight alterations in the form and appearance of parts ; for all disease begins with disordered actions or functions, and it is generally by the long continuance of disor- dered actions that changes are wrought in the appearance and structure of the parts diseased. For the same reason, when the cholera is sub- dued, the patient in India often gets well at once. Nothing but weakness is left, at least.

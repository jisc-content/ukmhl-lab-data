21 INTRODUCTION. ties; two upper cavities, called auricles, and two lower cavities, called ventricles ; an au- ricle and a ventricle on each side ; in its inter rior there are valves and other arrangements for circulating the blood through these cavities. The spleen is an organ not much firmer than the lungs, and of a dark blue or reddish colour. The liver is larger, and much firmer, of a red- dish brown colour, and having at its lower part a small bladder, called the gall-bladder, for the accumulation of bile. There is a canal or duct from the liver into the upper part of the small intestines, for conveying bile, which has an important office to perform, connected with the perfect digestion of the food. The kidneys are also firm organs, and of a greyish pink colour. There is a canal from each into the bladder. Close behind the stomach, and lying very close to the spine, is a long, narrow, and pale gland, or collection, or congeries of glandular bodies, called the pancreas, or sweetbread; there is a duct from it into the upper part of the small intestines ; and the fluid which is formed by the pancreas also contributes to digestion. But the stomach, the small and large intes- tines, the bladder, and the uterus or womb, are entirely different from these. They are hollow organs, capable of distension and contraction, and their walls are partly formed of thin and firm materials, called membrane, and partly of a coat consisting of muscular fibres. The stomach and intestines have three coats,â€”an outer one, composed of what anatomists term

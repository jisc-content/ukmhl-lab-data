CHOLERA IN POLAND AND PRUSSIA. 145 were subjected to some of the causes of disease which are incidental to poverty. Dr. Becker, who stated all these circumstances in a Report to Mr. Chad, his Majesty’s minister at Berlin, was one of the few persons in good circum- stances who died of it: he had no doubt of the contagiousness of the disease, and seems to have been a victim to his humane attentions to the sick*. The use of such remarks is, that cities and towns not yet attacked by cholera may learn from them how to lessen the number of its victims. Enough has been said to show the ravages of the cholera ; and it is only to be added that in July of the year 1831, when the disease was destroying so many people in Russia, it ap- peared in Arabia once more, after eight years’ absence, and destroyed 20,000 out of 50,000 pilgrims who were on their way to Mecca. The heat of the weather was very great. Abdin Bey, a commander of the troops of the Viceroy of Egypt, had marched at the head of the pil- grims to Mount Arafat, and returned to his palace in the afternoon. He went to bed in perfect health ; but at midnight both he and his wife were attacked with cholera, and soon after noon on the following day both were dead. Even Egypt, which was kept free from the cholera in the years 1820, 1821, 1822, and 1823, has at length been attacked by that * ^ was at first stated that Dr. Hecker died of cholera; but such does not seem to have been the case.

CHOLERA IN RUSSIA. 125 dresses, are such as to prepare them for the severest visitations of any epidemic disorders that become introduced among- them ; and the plague, which has often prevailed there, has devastated it more lately than any city in the same latitude. The dress of the poorer classes of the in- habitants of Moscow is very nearly that of the peasantry in general, and consists of sheep- skins, the wool being worn next the body. The warmth of such a dress may be very com- fortable ; but it is not likely to be kept very clean. A more particular account, however, both of the dress of the Russians, and of the Russian climate, will be given when speaking of St. Petersburg, the capital of the empire. It is worthy of observation, that those who have visited Calcutta after becoming acquainted with Moscow, have described themselves as continually forgetting at first that they were not still among the Russians, such is the re- semblance of some parts of Calcutta to Mos- cow ; where the same kind of palaces, the same description of miserable huts, and many similar customs, derived perhaps both by the Russians and the Hindoos from countries lying between both countries, very strikingly attract a strangerâ€™s notice. That, making al- lowance for great difference of climate, many similar causes of disease are to be found in both cities, is equally true; and is a truth not without interest to those who study the causes of disease with a view to limiting the dominion of sickness and misery.

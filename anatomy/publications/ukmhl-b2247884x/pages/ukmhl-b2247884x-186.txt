180 THE PHYSICIAN. Those who are not in actual attendance on the sick, but who go to see them as friends and neighbours, should not make long visits to them ; nor sit too near them ; nor inhale their breath ;—if there is any kind of bad smell in the room, they should not go in until it has dis- appeared ;—they may shake hands with the patients, but should not kiss their lips. If a window is open, they should sit between it and the patient’s bed ; if not, between the door and the lied, that the air may be carried from them towards the patient, rather than from the pa- tient towards them. No clothes that have been used by the pa- tient should be put into drawers with the clothes of other persons : all the dirty linen, sheets, &c., when taken out of the room, should be put at once into water out of the house, and then hung up in a free current of air. The best thing that can be done by way of fumigation is to use the chloride of lime, and its use is very simple and easy. It may be pro- cured at any druggist’s shop, and is not very dear ; a pound of it, which may be had for six- pence, is sufficient for a gallon of water, in which it should be dissolved. Some of this water should be sprinkled over the bed-room twice a day or oftener; not in great quantity at a time, because it is too stimulating to the lungs of a sick person. The stairs and passages may be sprinkled also. Some of this solution, or water containing the chloride of lime, should be poured upon the matters discharged by the vomiting or purging

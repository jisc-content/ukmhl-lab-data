114 THE PHYSICIAN. August; and he died of cholera after his re- turn. After that circumstance, the disease appeared first at one town on the Don and then at another, just as it had done in towns on the Volga, only going the other way ; till, on the 9th of September, it had got as far down as Jagaurog, where the Don runs into the Caspian Sea. From Saratoff, on the Volga, a town already mentioned, the disease went with the flying inhabitants to Peusa. A student also left SaratolF with a servant; his servant died on the road to Moscow, and the student himself is supposed to have been the first person who died of the cholera in the city of Moscow itself. The malady had come so rapidly on the town of Saratoff that the people had no time to take any precautions ; there was scarcely a family in it which had not to lament a death. All the four surgeons of the place were very soon attacked with it, and three of them died. All who could run away left the place: a clergymanâ€™s congregation was reduced from five hundred and fifty to one hundred and fifty. At first, the deaths were only four a day; they gradually increased to five, twelve, twenty, eighty, and at last up to two hundred and sixty in a day, and then in the same gra- dual manner began every day to be fewer and fewer. And it is very well worthy of being remembered, that a colony of Moravians in the middle of the town, being most strictly guarded by quarantine, escaped the disease altogether.

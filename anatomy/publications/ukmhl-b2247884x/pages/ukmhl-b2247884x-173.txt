HOW TO ESCAPE THE CHOLERA* 167 ami that the people called the Esquimaux, who build houses of ice and frozen snow, enjoy good health in them in the winter, but all become affected with bad colds when the warmth of the sun becomes sufficient to melt their houses in the spring. It is the same with respect to heat. There is not in all the world a finer climate than that of Egypt, which is remarkable for its dryness, except after the annual overflow of the Nile, when the ground is only drying; and as it soon gets completely dry, the unhealthy season is of short duration*. The excessive heat of India, if accompanied with a dry state of the air, agrees well with most people ; their appetite and spirits are good ; they are hot enough, to be sure, but not at all ill. It is when the rains come that they feel depressed, and that fevers and all sorts of evils come too. And if we look at home, into our fenny countries, we still find that the spring and the autumn, when the moisture is most abundant, are the seasons of ague and other fevers. Medical men, who are in the habit of looking at places and at people with reference to the subjects of health and disease, have long known that a continued residence in a damp and marshy situation, although it may not actually produce a common fever or an ague, yet gradually un- dermines the health ; makes the stomach weak, the functions of the skin languid, and lowers * P'^crcnt statements have been made by travellers ; but those who have seen most of Egypt give this account of its climate.j } K 3

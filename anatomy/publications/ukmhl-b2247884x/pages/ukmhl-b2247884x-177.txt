Every one may have ex- perienced that the exposure of the body for a long time to the heat of the sun produces some disturbance of the stomach ; nausea perhaps, and aversion to food.

It depresses the feeble ; lowers the circulation, cools the skin too much, and produces shivering: the blood seems to desert the surface and to crowd the vessels of some internal organ, and the person complains of headach, languor, and general oppression.

After such long exposure follow various irregularities of the cir-

207 APFENDIX. The heat of different climates having been frequently alluded to in the preceding pages, and expressed in the degrees according to Fahrenheitâ€™s thermometer, it should be ex- plained that the heat or coldness of the air is measured by this instrument in consequence of the mercury expanding as its temperature is raised, and contracting when cooled. A small bulb at the bottom of the thermometer is full of mercury : when the bulb is made warm the " mercury rises up the tube of the thermometer, and higher and higher as the heat becomes greater. At the sides of the tube are figures corresponding to lines, which lines mark degrees. The heat at which water boils, according to this thermometer, is 212 degrees ; that is to say, when the bulb is exposed to the heat of boiling water, the mer- cury rises to a certain height in the tube, and this height is divided into 212 equal parts. If the bulb is put into ice, the mercury falls as low as the 32nd mark ; therefore, according to the thermometer of Fahrenheit, the freezing point is 32, and the boiling point 212. When ther- mometers are made, both these points are tried; and the space between is divided into 18Q exact

It is here that the Company’s ships are unloaded, and thousands of English sailors have perished here. Even much heat is not required to bring forth from marshy places the miasmata, or noxious vapours, which produce some of these forms of disease. Perhaps it may be found that when thesd hurtful vapours are produced in a low temperature, the general effect is the production of ague, or intermittent fever; and when raised by a higher temperature, then fevers of a more continued form, and dysentery, are the consequences; at least this may be the case in our climate.

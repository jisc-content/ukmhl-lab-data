In a southerly direction, it passed down the whole of the coast of Coro- mandel, which forms the west side of the bay of Bengal. Some of the medical writers on this disease have given maps, showing the date of its arrival at each place. By a map of this sort, published by Mr. Scott, and in a smaller form by Mr. Hamilton Bell, we find the cholera at Ganjam about the middle of March, 1818. Ganjam is nineteen degrees north of the equator, or equinoctial line. In about two months more it W'as at Yizaga- patam, two degrees nearer the equator; in one month more, at Masulipatam, two degrees nearer the equator still; in one month after- wards it was at Ongole, one degree nearer the equator ; and thus it travelled at the rate of one degree of latitude of the earthâ€™s surface in a month ; that is to say, about seventy miles; and in this way it reached Madras in October, 1818, and, still passing along the coast south- ward, went on even to Cape Comorin, the end of the peninsula. The first part of this journey of the cholera was performed in dry weather, but the last part during the rainy season, in which the rate of its progress be- came greater than at first, for it passed over five degrees in three months. It seems also frequently to have travelled against the current of violent winds. There was occasionally something capri- cious in the march of cholera. Some towns

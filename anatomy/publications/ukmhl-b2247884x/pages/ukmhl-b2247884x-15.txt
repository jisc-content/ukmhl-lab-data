INTRODUCTION. 13 Yet this is only one part of the skeleton. Examine the bones of the arm and hand, and you find a long and very firm bone extending from the shoulder to the elbow, resting its round head in so shallow a socket, for the purpose of performing wide and free motions, that if it were not tied down by the strong muscles which move it, together with all the weights ever grasped by the hand, it would always be slipping out of place. The bone is round, or cylindrical, in shape, or nearly so, and has the strength of an arch. At the elbow you see another joint, quite different from that at the shoulder, and exactly like a hinge; not permitting such wide motion, but very free motion in one direction only. When this free motion is exerted, the fore-arm and hand are raised, and the muscle which raises them may be felt to swell almost like a ball, on the fore part of the arm, between the elbovv and the shoulder. Two long bones extend from the elbow to the wrist, one from the hinge, and the other, which allows the twisting or rotating of the fore-arm and hand, some- what loosely tied to the side of it. At the wrist you find a curious collection of small bones, eight in number, like so many peb- bles, compactly tied together; and these little bones compose the wrist-joint. Down to the very ends of the fingers you find joints per- mitting all the motions which are wanted : and the little bones of the wrist, the hand, and the fingers, with those of the fore-arm and arm, moved by contrivances presently to be men-

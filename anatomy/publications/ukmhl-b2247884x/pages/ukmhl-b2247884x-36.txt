THE PHYSICIAN. 30 put an end to sensation, or to motion, at will, by dividing them. How sensation is effected —how transmitted to the brain—in what man- ner the will is formed—how its orders are conveyed along the nervous chords to the muscles; all this we know nothing about. But if we are ignorant how thought is carried on, we are no less ignorant how the action of the heart is kept up—how respiration produces the changes which we know it effects on the blood—or in what manner, from one material, the blood, so many materials are so continually produced in the body. The chain of connexion already mentioned more than once, may here be mentioned again. Strong impressions, of various kinds, upon the nervous system will disturb the actions of the heart, and of all other muscles; will interrupt secretion, embarrass respiration, disorder diges- tion, and suspend nutrition. Thus fear or joy produce palpitation, or perhaps an hysteric fit: a sense of shame, or an indelicate word, will drive the red blood into the smaller ves- sels of the face and neck, and produce a blush. Bad news suddenly communicated will take away the appetite, and also, to use a common expression, “ take away the breath and con- tinued low spirits cause the body to waste away and become thin. An imperfect respira- tion, again, will disorder digestion and nutri- tion, and thus weaken the secreting power, and debilitate the nervous system itself. An irregular circulation cannot but disturb the lungs and the brain. A depraved digestion

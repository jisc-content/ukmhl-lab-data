96 THE PHYSICIAN to quarrel about the facts, but to hear both sides, and provide against the possible danger of the disease being one that can be commu- nicated from sick persons to persons in health. As far as regards the appearance of the cholera in the island of Mauritius, the simple facts are these :â€”They are taken from the journal of Mr. Foy, the surgeon of the Topaze*. The Topaze frigate arrived at Trincomalee in the island of Ceylon, on the 5th of September, 1819, and all the sick men were sent ashore, including some cases of dysentery, of which four ended fatally in the hospital. Whilst the ship was in the harbour, two other men, one a sail-maker, the other a marine, became sick, and died on board the ship, of Indian cholera; one on the 16th, the other on the 20th of September. Others were attacked with the same disease, but recovered ; a seaman had a return of the dysentery, and also died. The ship being ordered to the Mauritius, all the sick who had been sent ashore to the hospital were brought on board again, as it was thought the change of climate would do them good, very few of them having quite recovered. On the 9th of October the ship sailed from Trin- comalee, with fifty-seven men on the sick-list. The cholera broke out immediately afterwards, attacking seventeen of the crew, of whom four died, including one who had been in the hos- pital for dysentery. When the ship reached the Mauritius, all the sick who were confined to bed, fifteen in number, were sent ashore to # Medical Gazette, No. 207,

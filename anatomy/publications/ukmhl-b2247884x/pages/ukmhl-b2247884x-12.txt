The structure and functions of all the parts have so mutual a dependence, and so many connexions, that no part can be studied entirely separate from the rest. But a very useful degree of knowledge, both of anatomy and physiology, may be ac- quired by any one who is able to read, and who possesses ordinary powers of observation ; and it is to be regretted that so few persons of liberal education, or so few who are fond of something more than light reading, compre- hend these sciences in their plan of reading and study; and that there is, as an almost necessary consequence, so little accurate po- pular knowledge diffused concerning them.

18G THE PHYSICIAN. CHAPTER XI. TREATMENT OF CHOLERA. The character of cholera being so fatal, we are naturally led to ask how it may be escaped, or how, if a person is attacked with it, he ought to be treated. This is the true end of all our in- quiries. It is for this that we study anatomy, and inquire into the manner in which the different functions are performed. It is for this that we make such very diligent observations on diseases in all climates, and compare their symptoms, and look at the effects after death. By these means the physician or the surgeon learns to cure dis- eases, or to guard the public from them: and by the same means those who are neither physi- cians or surgeons may learn to take some care of themselves. The attacks of cholera are made so suddenly, they excite so much alarm, and so soon destroy the patient, that there is no disease of which it is more desirable that all persons should know the proper management. Even in towns, if the disease should unfortunately become very com- mon, persons might be lost for want of proper medical attendance: and in lone houses and cottages in the country, a severe attack of cholera would often carry off the patient before a medical man could reach him.

THE PHYSICIAN. 208 degrees. In temperate weather in England the mercury in the thermometer placed in the shade, in the open air, would rise to about 48 degrees. In warm weather, it rises to about 65. A room is of a comfortable warmth when mercury rises to the 55th degree. When the mercury rises to the 76th degree in the shade, butter begins to melt; when it rises to 80, the weather is what we call very hot, although it is very often ten, or fifteen, or even twenty de- grees, higher in India. The ordinary tempera- ture of the human body is a little more than 90 degrees, as shown by placing the bulb of the thermometer under the tongue, or even holding it a few minutes in the closed hand. In some fevers it rises to 100 or 104. The lowest point in our thermometer is called zero; but t here are degrees of coldness lower than this instrument indicates ; and which are indicated by other kinds of thermometers. We then say the cold is so many degrees below zero ; which it often is in a Russian winter. At forty de- grees below zero, the mercury becomes solid. Degrees are commonly thus written,—one hundred degrees of Fahrenheit—100° Fahr. In perusing this work, the reader who has the opportunity should refer to the Globe, and re- mark the situation of the Equator, or equinoctial line, and also the lines called the Tropics. He will see that the globe is divided into degrees, marked by lines across it, and down it. The hues

THE PHYSICIAN. 48 mination of this question cannot affect the his- torical truth of the foregoing observations: but the general dread now existing of the ap- pearance of cholera in its worst form—in a form which has proved alarmingly fatal for many months past in many cities of Europe,— gives to a description of this disease as it has at different times appeared in various parts of the world, and in this country, a great degree of interest; and an exposition of its nature cannot fail to impress on the minds of those who peruse it the best methods of avoiding it, or of controlling its ravages. That the disease has actually appeared in England is no longer a matter of doubt. That it has already carried off many of the aged, the sickly, and the intemperate, at Sunderland, is stated by a physician who is well acquainted with the Indian form of the malady*. Its pro- gress from Sunderland to other towns, although slow, has been certain; — and in one place, Gateshead (a close and dirty neighbourhood connected with Newcastle by a bridge across the river Tyne), it seized upon its victims with a frightful energy f. But whether the progress of this disease be slow or rapid, every man in his senses will do his best to guard against it, and spare no pains to understand what may be expected, and how it may be best overcome if it should attack him. * Dr. Daun. f See Postscript, p. 204.

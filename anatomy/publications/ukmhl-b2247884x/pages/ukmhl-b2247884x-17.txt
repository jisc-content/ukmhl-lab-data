INTRODUCTION. 15 A remarkable part of the human anatomy, generally quite unknown to those who do not study to qualify themselves for medicine or surgery, is that which serves to cover up and to move these firm and supporting bones: comprehending what are called the muscles of the human body. These are partly com- posed of what is commonly called flesh, and partly of a strong, white, shining substance, called tendon. Most of them are tendinous at one extremity, and the tendons of some are very long and slender, and yet possessed of great strength. If one arm, the left for in- stance, is grasped by the hand of the other, midway between the wrist and elbow, and then the fingers of the left hand are moved, the fleshy portion or fibres of the muscles situated in the left arm are felt to move or to contract, and they may be seen to draw up their long tendinous extremities in the wrist: these tendinous parts are bound down at the wrist, and pass on to the very extremity of the fingers, to move them. Everybody has no- ticed the tendons which move the toes of a bird,—white and strong strings, by pulling which the claws are made to bend :—in the living bird these tendons, which have now been divided, were moved by the contraction of the thick and fleshy part of the bird’s leg above them; the contraction of such part answering to the pulling of the hand at the tendons of the dead bird’s foot. Some of the muscles of the arm, shoulder, and thigh maybe very distinctly seen throughout almost their whole extent.

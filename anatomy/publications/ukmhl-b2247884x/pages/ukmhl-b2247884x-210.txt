204 THE PHYSICIAN. POSTSCRIPT. The progress of the cholera in the north of England, whilst these pages have been printing, affords a useful lesson to the people of those parts of the United Kingdom which have not yet been visited by it; and the lesson ought not to be thrown away. When it first appeared, as it did not attack many thousands of people at once, the fear of it greatly diminished. Many continued to deny that the true cholera had come to England. It was said that at this time of the year there was always great sick- ness at Sunderland ; and that the deaths were not more numerous this year than in other years. This kind of belief prevailed for two months, although the cholera was all that time steadily destroying one. in three, of those at- tacked. In the very worst descriptions of fever in England the mortality is seldom so great as one in ten of those attacked; it is more commonly about one in fifteen; and in favourable circumstances not perhaps more than one in twenty. Yet, until within the last week, the observation was continually repeated, that the cholera did not seem to be so very serious a disease after all!

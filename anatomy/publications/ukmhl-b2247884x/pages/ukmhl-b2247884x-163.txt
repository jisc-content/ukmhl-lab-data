HOW TO ESCAPE THE CHOLERA. 157 experience of cholera has shown the error into which the first observers of the disease fell, of ascribing it to the most ordinary circumstances. If there happened to be a violent storm, or much heat, or an unusual degree of cold, when the cholera appeared, the storm or the heat or the cold were asserted to be the cause of the cho- lera ; if a lake dried up, the cholera Was sup- posed to arise from the mud and slime ; if the east wind long prevailed, which is a wind that has a bad character in all climates, it was the east wind that brought the cholera. As it first was noticed in the thickly inhabited plains, it was supposed to be unable to ascend the hills. All these notions have been shown, by time and the progress of the malady, to be incorrect. It has crossed seas, mountains, and even deserts, but always, it would seem, with man—certainly always in the great thoroughfares of human traffic—a fact which may be and has been ap- plied to prove its contagious property ; although it is an imperfect proof, for the disease, even if carried along in the air only, could still only make its appearance where men were to be found. Among the mountains of the world, none are so lofty as those which may be seen in the map of India on the north and east of that country, called the Himalayah mountains; yet even there, the cholera has travelled up as far as man has carried his habitations. The town of Almorah, among those mountains, is 5337 feet above the level of the sea; but the cholera reached Al- morah, and prevailed there as severely as in the plains of Hindostan.

In this preliminary sketch nothing- more than the most general notice of them can be attempted. When the blood has undergone the proper changes in the lungs, it is sent to the auricle on the left side of the heart, from thence into the left ventricle, and from thence through the aorta, or great artery, into the countless branches which supply all parts of the body. There is hardly any portion of the human body into which blood is not carried. The prick of a pin, or the slightest wound on the surface of the body, produces a drop of blood. The smaller vessels are so minute and nu- merous as to form a kind of universal net- work. By processes carried on in their fine and invisible extremities, the structure of every part of the body is kept perfect. The materials of every part are supplied to every part. Bone is deposited in bone; muscle in muscle ; mem- brane in membrane : bile is formed in the liver; gastric juice in the stomach; milk in the female breast. If a part receives injury, these fine vessels conduct the work of repair, cause the adhesion of parts divided, or fill up, with an admirable masonry of fleshy granulations, a hollow wound, or conjoin and cement by new bony matter the fractured portions of the bones. It is clear that all this borrowing from the blood must be made up again in some way. rlhe supplies being so many, there must be some source of renewal. As the tree, which

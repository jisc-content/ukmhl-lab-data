ROOTS OF THE CRANIAL NERVES.—OPTIC. 585 same side ; the inner fibres cross over to the opposite side ; and fibres have been described as running from one optic tract to the other along the posterior part of the commissure, while others pass between the two optic nerves in its anterior part (Mayo). In front of the commissure, the nerve enters the foramen opticum, receiving a sheath from the dura mater and acquiring greater firmness. Fig. 398. Fig. 398.—Lateral View op the Connection op the Principal Nerves wits tB8 Brain. The full description of this figure will be found at p. 553. The following references apply to the roots of the nerves : I, the right olfactory tract cut near its middle ; ll, the optic nerves immediately in front of the commissure ; the right optic tract is seen passing hack to the thalamus (Th), corpora geniculata (i, e,), and corpora quadrigeraina (q) ; III, the right oculo-motor nerve ; IV, the trochlear nerve rising at v, from near the valve of Vieussens ; V, the trifacial nerve ; VI, the abducent ocular : a, VII, b, the facial and auditory nerves, and between them the pars intermedia ; a, VIII, 6, the roots of the glosso-pharyngeal, pneumo-gastric, and spinal accessory nerves ; IX, the hypoglossal nerve ; C I, the separate anterior and posterior roots of the suboccipital or first cervical nerve. The fibres of origin of the optic tract from the thalamus are derived partly from the superficial stratum and partly from the interior of that body. According to Foville, this tract is also connected with the taenia semicircularis, and with the termination of the gyrus fornicatus; and he states further, that where the optic tract turns round the back of the thalamus and the cerebral peduncle it receives other delicate fibres, which descend from the grey matter of those parts.— (Op. cit. p. 514.)

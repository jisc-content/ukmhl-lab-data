851 INTESTINAL NERVOUS PLEXUSES. in ganglion cells, which is situated between the circular and longitudinal muscular fibres of the intestine, and to which he has therefore given the name of " plexus myentericus." For the other observation we are indebted to Meissner, who has dis- Fif?. 597 A. Fig. 597 B. Fig. 597 A.—Nervous Plexus of Auerbach, from the Muscular Coat of a Child's Intestine (from Kolliker). ^ The drawing represents three perforated ganglionic masses united by several nervous cords, of which the thickest is also perforated, forming the "plexus myentericus." Fig. 597 B.—Small Portion of Meissner's Submucous Nervous Plexus from the Intestine of a Child (from Kolliker). ^ Two ganglia are represented, of which the cells are seen spreading into the nerve-twigs connected with the ganglia : the fusiform particles in the nerve-twigs are small connective- tissue corpuscles. covered a second richly gangliated plexus of nerves situated in the submucous layer, and which is found to communicate freely with the plexus myentericus of Auerbach by means of the larger branches. Both plexuses extend through the whole length of the intestine, from the pylorus to the anus. (Kolliker, Op. cit., pp. 430 and 432.) THE LAEGE INTESTINE. The large intestine extends from the termination of the ileum to the anus. It is divided into the csecum (including the vermiform appendix), the colon, and the rectum ; and the colon is again subdivided, according to its direc- tion, into four parts, called the ascending, transverse, and descending colon, and the sigmoid flexure. The length of the large intestine is usually about five or six feet ; being about one-fifth of the whole length of the intestinal canal. Its diameter, 3 K 2

675 GREAT SCIATIC NERVE. trochanter major, poiats to tlie tendon of the obturator internus; e, upper part of the femoral head of the biceps; /, semitendiaosus ; g, semimembranosus; A, gastrocnemius ; i, popliteal artery ; 1, placed on the gluteus minimus muscle, points to the superior gluteal nerves ; 2, inferior gluteal branches of the lesser sciatic; 3, placed on the greater sacro-sciatic ligament, points to the pudic nerve ; ?>', its farther course; 4, inferior pudendal; 5, placed on the upper divided part of the semitendinosus and biceps, points to the posterior middle cutaneous nerve of the thigh ; 6, great sciatic nerve, 6', 6', some of its muscular branches to the flexors ; 7, internal popliteal or posterior tibial nerve ; 7', its muscular or sural branches ; 8, external popliteal or peroneal nerve; 8', its external cutaneous branch; 9, communicating tibial; 9', communicating peroneal branch to the external saphenous nerve. The inferior pudendal branch turns forwards below the ischial tuberosity to reach the perinaeum. Its filaments then extend forwards to the front and outer part of the scrotum, and communicate with one of the superficial perineal nerves. In the female, the inferior pudendal branch is distributed to the external labium pudendi. h. The external cutaneous branches, two or three in number, turn upwards in a retrograde course to the skin over the lower and outer part of the great gluteal muscle. In some instances one takes a different course, descending and ramifying in the integuments on the outer side of the thigh nearly to the middle. c. Of the lower branches some small cutaneous filaments pierce the fascia of the thigh above the popliteal space. One of these, arising somewhat above the knee-joint, is prolonged over the popliteal region to the upper part of the leg. Of the terminal twigs, perforating the fascia lata opposite the lower part of the popliteal space, one accompanies the short saphenous vein beyond the middle of the leg, and others pass into the integument covering the inner and outer heads of the gastrocnemius muscle. Its terminal cutaneous branches communicate with the short saphenous nerve. GREAT SCIA.TIO NERVE. The great sciatic nerve (nervus ischiadicus), the largest nerve in the body, supplies the muscles at the back of the thigh, and by its branches of con- tinuation gives nerves to all the muscles below the knee and to the greater part of the integument of the leg and foot. The several joints of the lower limb receive filaments from it and its branches. This large nerve is continued from the lower end of the sacral plexus. Tt escapes from the pelvis through the great sacro-sciatic foramen, below the pyri- for mis muscle, and reaches down below the middle of the thigh, where it separates into two large divisions, named the internal and external popliteal nerves. At first it lies in the hollow between the great trochanter and the ischial tuberosity, covered by the gluteus maximus and resting ou the gemelli, obturator internus and quadratus femoris muscles, in company with the small sciatic nerve and the sciatic artery, and receiviug from that artery a branch which runs for some distance in its substance. Lower down it rests on the adductor magnus, and is covered behind by the long head of the biceps muscle. The bifurcation of the sciatic nerve may take place at any point intermediate be- tween the sacral plexus and the lower part of the thigh; and, occasionally, it is found to occur even within the pelvis, a portion of the pyriformis muscle being inter- posed between the two great divisions of the nerve. Branches of the trunk.â€”In its course downwards, the great sciatic nerve supplies offsets to some contiguous parts, viz., to the hip-joint, and to the muscles at the back of the thigh. a. The articular branches are derived from the upper end of the nerve, and enter the capsular ligament of the hip-joint, on the posterior aspect. They sometimes arise from the sacral plexus.

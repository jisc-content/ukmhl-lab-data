502 THE SPINAL COED. Fig. 339. till at last it is difficult to trace the serial relation of its constituent parts, or any correspondence with the structure of the cord. Fig. 339.—View of the Cerebro- spinal Axis op the Nervous System (after Bourgery). ^ The right half of the cranium and trunk of the body has been removed by a vertical section ; the membranes of the brain and spinal marrow have also been removed, and the roots and first part of the fifth and ninth cranial, and of all the spinal nerves of the right side, have been dissected out and laid separately on the wall of the skull and on the several vertebrae opposite to the place of their natural exit from the cranio-spinal cavity.

A.—THE SPINAL CORD. The spinal cord, or spinal marrow (medulla spinalis),, is that part of the cerebro-spinal axis which is situated within the vertebral canal. It extends from the margin of the foramen magnum of the occipital bone to about the lower part of the body of the first lumbar vertebra. It is continued into the medulla oblongata above, and ends below in a slender filament, the filum terminate or central ligament of the spinal cord. Invested closely by a proper membrane (the pia mater), the cord is enclosed within a sheath (theca) considerably longer and larger than itself, which is formed by the dura mater, and which is separated from the walls of the

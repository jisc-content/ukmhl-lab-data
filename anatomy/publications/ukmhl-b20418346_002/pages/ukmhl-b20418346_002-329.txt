815 THE PAROTID GLAND. Its outer surface is convex and lobulated, and is covered by the skin and fascia, and partially by the platysma muscle. It is bounded above by the zygoma, below by a line drawn backwards from the lower border of the jaw to the sterno-mastoid muscle, and behind by the external meatus of the ear, the mastoid process, and sterno-mastoid muscle. Its anterior border, which lies over the ramus of the lower jaw, is less distinctly defined, and stretches forwards to a variable extent on the masseter muscle. It is from this anterior border of the gland that the excretory duct passes off; and there is Fig. 572.

On trying to raise the deeper part of the parotid gland from its position, it is found to extend far inwards, between the mastoid process and the ramus of the jaw, towards the base of the skull, and to be intimately connected with several deep-seated parts. Thus, above, it reaches into and occupies the posterior part of the glenoid cavity ; behind and below, it touches the digastric muscle, and rests on the styloid

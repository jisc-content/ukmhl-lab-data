THE THALAMI OPTICT. 551 and rest on the corresponding cerebral crui-a, which they in a manner embrace. On the outer side each thalamus is bounded by the corpus striatum and taenia semicircularis. The upper surface, which is white, is free and prominent, and is partly seen in the lateral ventricle, and partly covered by the fornix. The part which is seen in the lateral ventricle is more elevated than the rest, and is named the anterior tubercle. The posterior surface, which is also white and free, projects into the descending Fig. 376.

The inner sides of the two thalami are in contact one with the other. They present the grey substance of the inte- rior of the thalami uncovered with white, and are generally partially united together by a transverse portion, which forms the middle or soft commissure of the third ventricle.

Fig. 368. 338 anterior cerebral convolu- maxillary division ; 3, inferior maxillary division ; VI, the sixth nerve ; VII a, the the foetus they are at first blended together, and they become separated about the beginning of the seventh month. In most vertebrate animals there is but one white eminence or corpus albicans in their place. DULLA Oblongata, Pons Varolii, Crura Cerebri, and other Central Portions of THE EnCEPHALON. On the right side the convolutions of tbe cen- tral lobe or island of Reil have been left, together with a small part of the tions : on the left side these have been removed by an incision carried between the thalamus opticus and the cerebral hemisphere. 1', the olfactory tract cut short and lying in its groove between two con- volutions ; II, the left optic nerve in front of the commissure ; II', the right optic tract; Th, the cut surface of the left thalamus opticus; C, the central lobe or island of Eeil ; JSy, fissure of Sylvius; x x, locus perforatus anterior; e, the external, and i, the internal corpus genicu- latum ; h, the hypophysis cerebri or pituitary body ; tc, tuber cinereum with the infundibulum ; a, one of the corpora albicantia; P, the cerebral peduncle or crus ; /, the fillet ; III, close to the left oculo-motor nerve ; x, the locus perforatus pos- ticus ; PV, pons Varolii; V, the greater root of the fifth nerve ; +, the lesser or motor root ; on the right side this + is placed on the Gasserian ganglion, and points to the lesser root, where it proceeds to join the inferior maxillary nerve ; 1, ophthalmic division of the fifth nerve ; 2, superior facial; VII b, the auditory nerve ; VIII, the pneumo-gastric nerve ; VIII a, the glosso- phai'yngeal; VIII b, the spinal accessory nerve ; IX, the hypoglossal nerve ; fl, the floc- culus ; fh, the horizontal fissure of the cerebellum (Ce) ; am, the amygdala; pa, the anterior pyramid ; o, the olivary body ; the restiform body ; d, the anterior median fissure of the spinal cord, above which the decussation of the pyramids is represented ; ca, the anterior column ; cl, the lateral column of the spinal cord ; CI, the suboccipital or first cervical nerve. The tuber cinereum is a lamina of grey matter extending forwards from the corpora albicantia to the optic commissure, to which it is attached, and forming, as afterwards described, part of the floor of the third ventricle,

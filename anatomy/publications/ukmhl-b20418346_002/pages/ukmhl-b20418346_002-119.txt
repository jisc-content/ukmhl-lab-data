GUSTATORY NERVE. 607 front of the dental nerve, and sometimes united to it by a cord which, crosses over the internal maxillary artery. It is there joined at an acute angle by the chorda tympani, a small branch connected with the facial nerve, which descends from the inner end of the Glaserian fissure. It then passes between the internal pterygoid muscle and the lower maxilla, and is inclined obliquely inwards to the side of the tongue, over the upper constrictor of the pharynx, (where this muscle is attached to the maxillary bone,) and above the deep portion of the submaxillary gland. Lastly, the nerve crosses Wharton's duct, and is continued along the side of the tongue to the apex, in contact with the mucous membrane of the mouth. (a) Communicating branches are given to the submaxillary ganglion, at the place Fig. 409.

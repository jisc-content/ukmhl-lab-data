ORIOm OF THE BILIARY DUCTS. 875 Commencements of the Ducts.—The smallest bile ducts which are satisfac- torily known, ramify between the lobules along with the interlobular blood- vessels : but it is still a matter of discussion liow the bile enters these ducts, and wbat is the mode of its secretion. Fig. 613. A B Fig. 613.—Diagrams showing the arrangement op the Blood-vessels and Ducts WITHIN AND BETWEEN THE LOBULES, ACCORDING TO KlERNAN. 52 In A, p, p, interlobular branches of tlie portal vein ; I, I, intralobular venous plexus, connecting the portal veins (p, p) with the intralobular vein (h) in the centre, which is the commencing branch of the hepatic vein ; in B, d, d are two branches of the hepatic duct, which is supposed to commence in a plexus situated towards the circumference of the lobule marked b, h, called by Kiernan the biliary plexus. Within this is seen the central part of the lobule, containing branches of the intralobular (hepatic) vein. Kiernan described the smallest biliary ducts as commencing within the lobules by numerous ramifications in the form of a close network, which be was only able to inject in the outer part of each lobule. Since tbe discovery of the hepatic cells, however, it has been very generally supposed Fig. 614.

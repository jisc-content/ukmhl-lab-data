1006 iSURGICAL ANATOMY OF THE ARTERIES. ticial structures have been divided, assistance will be derived from the trachea or the larynx, as well as from the pulsation, in determining the exact situation of the artery. The trachea, from its roughness, may be Fig. 698. Fig. 698,â€”View of the Right Common Carotid and Subclavian Arteries, with THE Origin op their Branches and their Relations (from R.

URINIFEROUS TUBES AND MALPIGHIAN CORPUSCLES. 931 sometimes of only g^-^^tli or -^^^^th of an inch. They consist each of a mem- branous capsule, containing a tuft of blood-vessels.

PRESENTATION OP A PART OF THE STRAIGHT AKD CONVO- LUTED Uriniferous Tubes WITH THE Glomeruli (from Frey after a drawing by Miiller). 6, h, two large straight tubes in the medullary substance of the pyramid ; c, convoluted tubes with several of their termina- tions in the Malpighian cap- sules as in d ; a, three arteries passing up the pyramid and dividing into branches to the glomeruli: the efferent vessels are also represented and the network of capillaries between them and the veins. glomerulus is formed by a small afferent artery break- ing up at once into a num- ber of minute branches, which possess simple nu- cleated walls, form convo- luted loops, and are re- united in a single efferent vessel, placed close to the afferent: the further his- tory of the afferent and efferent vessels will be de- scribed later. The capsule, by which the glomerulus is surrounded, is formed of homogeneous membrane. The glomerulus receives the two vessels at one part ; and at another it is continued into a convoluted uriniferous tubule, as was first pointed out by Bow- man. Gerlach and others have considered that it may be formed on one side; or may be so placed at the extreme point of a looped tubule, that it appears to be continuous with two tubuli ; but it is now gene- rally admitted as the result of filling the tubes both by injections from the ureter and by extravasation from the glomeruli, that although in certain amphibia they may be placed 3 p 2

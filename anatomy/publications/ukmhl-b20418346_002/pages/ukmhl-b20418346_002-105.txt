593 OPTIC NERVE.—THIRD PAIR. section it is seen to consist of a number of separate bundles of nerve fibres, imbedded in tough fibrous tissue prolonged from the dura mater, and per- forated in the centre by the small arteria centralis retinae, which passes into it soon after it enters the orbit. It is surrounded by the recti muscles, and, entering the eyeball posteriorly a little to the inside of its mid ile, it pierces the sclerotic and choroid coats, and expands in the retina.—(See the Anatomy of the Eye.) It may be mentioned that in many fishes the optic nerves do not unite iu a com- missure, but merely cross each to the side opposite to that of their origin; and that in a number of the same animals, as was first pointed out by Malphighi, the nerve consists of a lamina thrown into complicated longitudinal plications, and surrounded by a sheath. THIRD PAIR OF NERVES. This nerve, the common motor nerve of the eyeball (motorius oculi), gives branches to five of the seven muscles of the orbit,—viz., to the Fig. 402.—View from above OF THE Uppermost Nerves OP the Orbit, the (jAs- SERiAN Ganglion, &o. (from Sappey after Hirschfeld and Level] le), | I, the olfactory tract passing forwards into the bulb ; II, the commissure of the optic nerves; III, the oculo-motor ; IV, the trochlear nerve ; V, the greater root of the fifth nerve, a small portion of the lesser root is seen below it; VI, the sixth nerve ; VII, facial; VIII, audi- tory ; IX, glosso-pharyngeal ; X, pneumo-gastric ; XI, spinal accessory; XII, hypoglossal ; 1, the Grasserian ganglion; 2, ophthalmic nerve; 3, lachrymal branch ; 4, frontal; 5, external frontal or supraorbital ; 6, internal frontal ; 7, supra- trochlear branch; 8, nasal nerve; 9, infratrochlear branch; 10, internal nasal passing through the internal orbital foramen ; 11, anterior deep temporal proceeding from the buccal nerve; 12, middle deep temporal; 13, posterior deep temporal arising from the masseteric; 14, origin of the temporo-auricular ; 15, great si superior, internal and inferior straight muscles, to the levator palpebrse, and to the inferior oblique muscle. Cylindrical and firm, like the other motor nerves, the third nerve, quitting the investment of the arachnoid membrane, pierces the inner layer of the dura mater close to the posterior clinoid process, and proceeds towards the sphenoidal fissure, lying in the external fibrous boundary of the cavernous sinus.

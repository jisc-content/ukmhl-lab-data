THORACIC GANTtLIA. 695 Fig. 454.—Diagrammatic View of the SrMPATHETio Cord op the "Right Side, showing ITS Connections with the Principal Cerbbro-Spinal Neryes and the Main Preaortic Plexuses. ^ Cerebrospinal Nerves.—VI, a portion of the sixth cranial nerve as it passes through the cavernous sinus, receiving two twigs from, the carotid plexus of the sympathetic nerve ; 0, ophthalmic ganglion connected by a twig with the carotid plexus ; M, coanectioa of the spheno-palatine ganglion by the Vidian nerve with the carotid plexus ; 0, cervical plexus ; Br, brachial plexus; D6, sixth intercostal nerve; D 12, twelfth; L 3, third lumbar nerve ; S 1, first sacral nerve ; S 3, third ; S 5, fifth ; Cr, anterior crural nerve ; Cr', great sciatic, pn, pneumo-gastric nerve in the lower part of the neck; r, recurrent nerve winding round the subclavian artery. Sympathetic Cord. —c, superior cervical ganglion ; c', second or middle ; c", inferior : from each of these ganglia cardiac nerves (all deep on this side) are seen descending to the cardiac plexus ; dl, placed immediately below the first dorsal sympathetic ganglion ; d6, is opposite the sixth; 11, first lumbar ganglion; eg, the terminal or coccygeal ganglion. Preaortic and Visceral Plexuses.—pp, pharyngeal, and, lower down, laryngeal plexus ; pi, posterior pulmonary plexus spreading from the pneumo-gastric on the back of the right bronchus ; ca, on the aorta, the cardiac plexus, towards which, in addition to the cardiac nerves from the three cervical sympathetic ganglis^,, other branches are seen descending from the pneumo-gastric and recurrent nerves ; co, right or posterior, and co', left or anterior coronary plexus ; o, cesophageal plexus in long meshes on the gullet; sp, great splanchnic nerve formed by branches from the fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth dorsal ganglia ; +, small splanchnic from the ninth and tenth ; + +, smallest or third splanchnic from the eleventh : the first and second of these are shown joining the solar plexus, so; the third descending to the renal plexus, re; connecting branches between the solar plexus and the pneumo-gastric nerves are also represented ; pn', above the place where the right pneumo-gastric passes to the lower or posterior surface of the stomach ; pn", the left distributed on the anterior or upper surface of the cardiac portion of the organ : from the solar plexus large branches are seen surrounding the arteries of the coeliac axis, and descending to ms, the superior mesenteric plexus ; opposite to this is an indication of the suprarenal plexus ; below re (the renal plexus), the spermatic plexus is also indicated ; ao, on the front of the aorta, marks the aortic plexus, formed by nerves descending from the solar and superior mesenteric plexuses and from the lumbar ganglia ; mi, the inferior mesenteric plexus surrounding the corresponding artery; hi/^ hypogastric plexus placed between the common iliac vessels, connected above with the aortic plexus, receiving nerves from the lower lumbar ganglia, and dividing below into the right and left pelvic or inferior hypogastric plexuses ; pi, the right pelvic plexus ; from this the nerves descending are joined by those from the plexus on the superior hemor- rhoidal vessels, mi', by sympathetic nerves from the sacral ganglia, and by numerous visceral nerves from the third and fourth sacral spinal nerves, and there are thus formed the rectal, vesical, and other plexuses, which ramify upon the viscera from behind for- wards and from below upwards, as towards ir, and v, the rectum and bladder. distributed in a great measure to the thoracic aorta, the vertebrae, and liga- ments. Several of these branches enter the posterior pulmonary plexus. The branches furnished by the lower six or seven ganglia unite into three cords on each side, which pass down to join plexuses in the abdomen, and are distinguished as the great, the small, and the smallest splanchnic nerve. THE GREAT SPLATfCHNIC NERVE. This nerve is formed by the union of small cords (roots) given off by the thoracic ganglia from the fifth or sixth to the ninth or tenth inclusive. By careful examination of specimens after immersion in acetic or diluted nitric acid, small filaments may be traced from the splanchnic roots upwards as far as the third ganglion, or even as far as the first (Beck, in the " Philo- sophical Transactions," Part 2, for 1846). Gradually augmented by the successive addition of the several roots, the cord descends obliquely inwards over the bodies of the dorsal vertebrae ; and, after perforating the crus of the diaphragm at a variable point, termi-

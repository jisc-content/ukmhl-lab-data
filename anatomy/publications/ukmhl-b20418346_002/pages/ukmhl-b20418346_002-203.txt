UPPER CARDIAC NERVE. 691 nerve; and, rather lower down, by one or more filaments from the trunk of the pneumo-gastric nerve; lastly, on entering the chest, it joins with the recurrent laryngeal. Fig. 453. -19 Fig. 453.—Connections of the Cervical and Upper Dorsal Sympathetic Ganglia AND Nerves on the Left Side. The full description of this figure will be found at p. 620. The following numbers refer to the sympathetic ganglia and nerves, and those immediately connected with them:—3, pharyngeal plexus; 8, laryngeal plexus; 13, pulmonary plexus; and to the reader's left, above the pulmonary artery, a part of the cardiac plexus ; 24, superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic ; 25, middle cervical ganglion ; 26, inferior cervical ganglion united with the first dorsal ganglion ; 27, 28, 29, 30, second, third, fourth, and fifth dorsal ganglia. Variety.—Instead of passing to. the thorax in the manner described, the superior cardiac nerve may join the cardiac branch furnished from one of the other cer- vical ganglia. Scarpa describes this as the common disposition of the nerve ; but Cruveilhier (Anat. Descript., t. iv.) states that he has not in any case found the cardiac nerves to correspond exactly with the figures of the Tabulae Neurologicse."^

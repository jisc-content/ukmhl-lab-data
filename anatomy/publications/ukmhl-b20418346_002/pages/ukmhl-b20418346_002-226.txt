7U THE EYE. THE CORNEA. The cornea (cornea pellucida), the transparent fore part of the external coat, admits light into the interior of the ball. It is nearly circular in shape, and its arc extends to about one-sixth of the circumference of the whole globe ; it is occasionally widest in the transverse direction. Being of a curvature of a smaller radius than the sclerotic, it projects forwards beyond the general surface of curvature of that membrane, somewhat like the glass of a watch : the degree of its curve varies, however, in different persons, and at different periods of life in the same person, being more prominent in youth and flattened in advanced age. Its thickness is in general nearly the same throughout, viz., from nj-^ to -J^ of an inch, except- ing towards the outer margin where it becomes somewhat thinner. The posterior concave surface exceeds slightly in extent the anterior or convex, in consequence of the latter being encroached on by the opacity of the sclerotic. Fig. 460.

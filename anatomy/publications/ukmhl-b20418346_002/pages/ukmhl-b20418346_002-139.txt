627 HYPOGLOSSAL NERVE. enclose an irregularly-shaped space. From this interlacement of the nerves, filaments are continued backwards to the posterior belly of the omo-hyoid, and downwards to the sterno-hyoid and sterno-thyroid muscles. Occasionally a filament is continued to the chest, where it joins the cardiac and phrenic nerves. Fig 419.

It is not uncommon to find the descending branch of the ninth nerve within the sheath of the large cervical vessels, and in such cases it is placed either over or under the vein. This nerve in some cases appears to be derived either altogether from the pneumo-gastric, or from both the pneumo-gastric and hypoglossal nerves. There is every reason, however, to believe that these varieties in origin are only apparent, arising from the temporary adhesion of the filaments of this branch to those of the

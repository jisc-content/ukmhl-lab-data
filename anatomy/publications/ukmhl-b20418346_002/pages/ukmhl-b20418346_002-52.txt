THE CEREBRUM. 540 under surface of the cerebrum is concealed by the cerebellum and the pons Varolii. If, however, these parts be removed, it v^^ill be seen that the two hemispheres of the cerebrum are separated behind as they are in front, by the descent of the great longitudinal fissure between them, and that this fissure is arrested by a cross mass of white substance, forming the posterior extremity of the corpus callosum. This posterior part of the great longi- tudinal fissure is longer than the anterior portion. INTERNAL PARTS OF THE CEREBRUM. The anatomy of the interior of the cerebrum is most conveniently studied by removing, after the manner of Vieussens and Vicq-d'Azyr, successive portions of the hemispheres by horizontal sections, beginning from above.

The first horizontal section, to be made about half an inch above the corpus callosum, displays the internal white matter of each hemisphere, speckled with red spots where its blood-vessels have been divided, and sur-

NASAL FOSSiE. 773 the groove of the vomer, as well as into the median ridge between the superior maxillae. Fig. 531.—OssEOTTs AND Cartilagi- nous Septum of the Nose, seen FROM THE Left Side (from Ar- nold), i a, right nasal bone; h, superior maxillary bone ; c, sphenoidal sinus ; cZ, perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone ; e, vomer ; 2*, inner part of the right lower lateral cartilage ; 4, carti- lage of the septum. This cartilage is the persistent anterior extremity of the primor- dial cranium. In young subjects it is prolonged back to the body of the pre-sphenoid bone ; and in many adults an irregular thin band remains between the vomer and the central plate of the ethmoid. NASAL FOSS.^. The nasal fossse, and the various openings into them, with the posterior nares, have been previously described as they exist in the skeleton, and the Fig. 532.

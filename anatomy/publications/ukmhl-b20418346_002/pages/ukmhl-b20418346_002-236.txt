THE EYE. 724 The nerves for the supply of the iris are named ciliary : they are nume- rous and large ; and, before entering the iris, divide in the substance of the ciliary muscle. Fig 470. Fig. 471.

The nerves are represented too large. The ciliary nerves, about fifteen in nuni' ber, and derived from the lenticular ganglion and the nasal branch of the ophthalmic division of the fifth nerve, pierce the sclerotic near the entrance of the optic nerve, and come immediately in contact with

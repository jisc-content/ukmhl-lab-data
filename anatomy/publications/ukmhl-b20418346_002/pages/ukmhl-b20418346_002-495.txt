THE VAGmA. 981 while in the former it amounts to five or six. Each end of the vagina is somewhat narrower than the middle part : the lower, which is continuous with the vulva, is the narrowest part, and has its long diameter from before Fig. 683.—Sectional View of the Viscera op the Female Pelvis (after Houston and from nature). 4' promontory of the sacrum ; s, symphysis of the pubes ; v, the upper part of the urinary bladder ; v, the neck ; v', n, the urethra ; u, the uterus ; va, the vao-ina • r the point of union of the middle and lower parts of the rectum : r', the fold between the middle and upper parts of the rectum ; a, the anus ; I, the right labium ; n, the right nympha ; h, the hymen ; cl, the divided clitoris with the prepuce. The pelvic viscera, having been distended and hardened with alcohol previous to making the section, appear somewhat larger than natural. backwards ; the middle part is widest from side to side, being flattened from before backwards, so that its anterior and posterior walls are ordinarily in contact with each other ; at its upper end it is rounded, and expands to receive the vaginal portion of the neck of the uterus, which is embraced by it at some distance from the os uteri. The vagina reaches higher up on the cervix uteri behind than in front, so that the uterus appears, as it were, to be let into its anterior wall. On the wmer surface of the vagina, along the anterior and the posterior walls, a slightly elevated ridge extends from the lower end upwards along the middle line, similar to the raphe in other situations : these ridges are named the columns of the vagina, or columnce rugarum. Numerous den- tated transverse ridges, called rugce, will also be observed, particularly in persons who have not borne children, running at right angles from the columns. These columns and rugse are most evident near the entrance of

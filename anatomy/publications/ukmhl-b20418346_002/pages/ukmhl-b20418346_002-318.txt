THE TEETH. 804 It is just before the shedding of the temporary incisors, i. e., about the sixth year, that there is the greater-1 number of teeth in the jaws. At that period there are all the milk teeth, and all the permanent set except the wisdom teeth, making forty-eight. Fig. 562. Fig. 562.—The Teeth op a Child op Six Years, with the Calcified Parts op the Permanent Teeth exposed (after Henle and from nature). The whole of the teeth of the right side are shown, together with the three front teeth of the left side : in the upper and lower jaws the teeth are indicated as follows, viz.:— 1, milk teeth — i, inner or first incisor; i', outer or second incisor ; c, canine ; m, first molar ; m', second molar. 2, permanent teeth — I, inner or first incisor ; I', outer or second incisor ; C, canine ; B, first bicuspid ; B', second bicuspid ; M^, the first molar, which has passed through the gums ; the second molar, which has not yet risen above the gums : the third molar is not yet formed. During the growth of the teeth the jaw increases in depth and length, and undergoes changes in form. In the child it is shallow, but it becomes much deeper in the adult. In the young subject the alveolar arch describes almost the segment of a circle ; but in the adult the curv^e is semi-elliptical. The increase which takes place in the length of the jaw arises from a growth behind the position of the milk teeth, so as to provide room for the three additional teeth on each side belonging to the permanent set. At certain periods in the growth of the jaws there is not sufficient room in the alveolar arch for the growing sacs of the permanent molars ; and hence those parts are found at certain stages of their development to be enclosed in the base of the coronoid process of the lower jaw, and in the maxillary tuberosity in the upper jaw, but they afterwards successively assume their ultimate position as the bone increases in length.

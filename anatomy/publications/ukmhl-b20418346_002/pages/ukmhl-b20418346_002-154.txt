THE BRACHIAL PLEXUS 642 —the three nerves giving rise to one large upper cord. The eighth cervical and first dorsal nerves are united in another lower cord whilst they are Fig. 425. Fig. 425.—Deep Disslction of the Axilla, showing the Brachial Plexus and NEIGHBOURING Nerves (from Sappey after HirscLfeld and Leveill^). | The clavicle has been sawn through near its sternal end, and is turned aside with the muscles attached to it; the subclavius, and the greater and lesser pectoral muscles have been removed from the front of the axilla. 1, loop of union between the descendens noni and a branch of the cervical plexus ; 2, pneumo-gastric; 3, phrenic passing down to the inner side of the scalenus anticus muscle ; 4, anterior primary division of the fifth cervical nerve ; 5, the same of the sixth ; 6, 7, the same of the seventh and eighth cervical nerves : 8, the same of the first dorsal nerve ; 9, 9, branch from the plexus to the subclavius muscle, communicating with the phrenic nerve ; 10, posterior thoracic nerve distributed to the serratus magnus ; 11, upper anterior thoracic nerve passing into the great pectoral muscle ; 13, lower anterior thoracic distributed to the lesser pectoral; 14, twig of com- munication between these two nerves ; 12, suprascapular nerve passing through the supra- scapular notch ; 15, lower of the two subscapular nerves ; 16, nerve of the teres major ; 17, long subscapular, or nerve of the latissimus dorsi ; 18, accessory of the internal cutaneous nerve; 19, union of the accessory cutaneous with the second and third inter- costal nerves ; 20, lateral branch of the second intercostal ; 21, second internal cutaneous or nerve of Wrisberg ; 22, internal cutaneous nerve ; 23, the ulnar nerve to the inside of the axillary artery, passing behind the vein, and having, in this case, a union with the upper division of the plexus ; 24, the median nerve immediately below the place where its two roots embrace the artery, which is divided above this place; 25, the musculo-cutaneous nerve passing into the coraco-brachialis muscle ; 26, the musculo-spiral nerve passing behind the divided brachial artery.

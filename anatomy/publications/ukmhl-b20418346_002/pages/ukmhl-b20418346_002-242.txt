THE EYE. 730 like appearance. Only capillary vessels occupy tlie yellow spot, the larger branches passing round it. Fig. 479. Fig. 479.—Vertical Section op the Hetina through the Middle op the Fovea Centralis (from Ilenle.) 222 This figure Is taken from a preparation of the human retina hardened in alcohol, and is designed to show the peculiarities of this part as compared with other regions of the retina, viz., the obliquity of the Miillerian fibres, the thinness of the layer of nerve fibres, and the absence of the granular layer in the centre, a, h, cones of the columnar layer ; c, external nuclear layer ; d, internal nuclear layer ; /, external fibrous layer ; g, molecular substance next to A, the ganglionic layer ; the layer of nerve fibres ; I, the internal limiting membrane. The yellow colour of the macula lutea is deepest towards the centre, and is due to a pigment which imbues all the layers except the columnar : it does not appear to be contained in cells, and is soon removed after death by the action of water. Ciliary part of the retina.—The structure which has been named the ciliary part of the retina is situated in front of the ora serrata, and extends thence over the inner ends of the ciliary processes to the base of the iris (therefore, over the whole corona ciliaris). Though entirely destitute of the nervous parts of the retinal structure, it is still in continuity with the sub- stance of the retina, and in the form of a grey membrane, adheres to the ciliary proce.sses and zonule of Zinn, and is usually in great part detached from the neighbouring parts along with the latter. Accordiug to Kolliker, this layer consists of elongated nucleated cells, which in the human subject are broad externally, and with flat or forked bases set upon the internal limiting membrane. He regards these cells as probably corresponding to the Miillerian fibres, and as constituting in this place the only representative of the retinal structure.

THE PEPJTOXEUM. The sac of tlie omentum may be laid open by means of an incision a little Fig. 579. Fig. 579, A.â€”Diagrammatic Outline of a SUPPOSED Section of the Body, showing THE Inflections of the Peritoneum in THE Female, i The upper part of tLe section is a little to the right of the mesial plane of the body, through the quadrate and Spigelian lobes of the liver ; below it is supposed to be mesial: / c, placed above the diaphragm opposite to the coronary ligarcent of the liver ; I, the liver; 1', lobe of Spigel ; s, stomach ; c, transverse colon ; the small intestine ; a, pancreas ; d, the duodenum ; v, urinary bladder; w, uterus; rectum; r', its middle part opened ; ra, vagina; p,2^, the parietal peritoneum lining tlie front and back of the abdominal cavity; the line representing the inflections of the greater sac of the peritoneum will be traced from the neighbourhood of Ic, where it passes on the upper sui-face of the liver over the upper and lower surfaces of that organ, in the front of gh, the gastro-hepatic omentum, over the front of the storuach, down to o', the outer layer of the great omentum, whence, according to the most received view, it passes back to the vicinity of the pancreas, and re-descends as the upper layer of the transverse meso-colon ; after enclosing the colon it returns on the lower surface of the transverse meso-colon, mc, to the root of the mesentery, m ; it now forms the mesentery and encloses the small in- testine, returning to the duodenum and posterior wall of the abdomen, whence it passes over the rectum, r, descends into the recto-vaginal pouch, u', covers the back and front of the uterus and the bladder partially and regains the anterior abdominal wall above the pubes ; as connected with the lesser sac of the peritoneum, u; marks the position of the foramen of Winslow as if seen in perspective beyond the section ; the lesser sac with the sac of the omentum is shaded with horizontal lines, and is marked 0 0 : round this space the line of the peri- toneum may be traced .rom the diaphragm over the lobe of Spigei, to the back of the gastro-hepatic omentum, thence behind the stomach and down into the sac of the om entum; it then ascends to thepancreas, which it covers, and thence reaches again the diaphragm. B, is a sketch of jart of a section similar to that of A, but showing the different view freciuently taken, according to which the two layers of the meso-colon after enclosing the colon descend to form the posterior pair of the layers of the great omentum. below the great curvature of the stomach. It will then be seen that the inner wall of this sac, having invested

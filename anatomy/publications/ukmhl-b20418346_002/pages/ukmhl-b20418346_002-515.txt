1001 rOKMATION OF THE EXTERNAL ORGANS. the rudimentary clitoris or penis, and between the prolonged margins of the groove beneath that organ. This opening, but not the clitoris or penis, is concealed by the large cutaneous folds ah'eady mentioned. In this condition, which continues until the twelfth week, the parts appear alike in both sexes, and resemble very much the perfect female organs. The rudiments of Coivper's glanda are, it is said, seen at an early period, near the root of the rudimentary clitoris or penis, on each side of the genito-urinary passage. In the female, the two lateral cutaneous folds enlarge, so as to cover the clitoris and form the labia majora. The clitoris itself remains relatively smaller, and the groove on its under surface less and less marked, owing to the opening out and sub- sequent extension backwards of its margins to form the nymphcB. The hyynen begins to appear about the fifth month. Within the nymphae, the urethral orifice, as already mentioned, becomes distinct from that of the vagina. In the male, on the contrary, the penis continues to enlarge, and the margins ot the groove along its under surface gradually unite from the primitive urethral orifice behind, as far forward as the glans, so as to complete the long canal of the male urethra. This is accomplished about the fifteenth week. When this union remains incomplete, the condition named hypospadias is produced. In the mean- time the prepuce is formed, and, moreover, the lateral cutaneous folds also unite from behind forwards, along the middle line or raphe, and thus complete the scrotum into which the testicles do not descend until the last month of foetal existence. The following tabular scheme of the corresponding parts of the genito- urinary organs in the two sexes, and of their relation to the formative rudiments of the common embryonic type, may be useful in fixing attention on the more important points of the subject.

MEASUREMENT OF THE CONVOLUTIONS. 571 superior intellect he selected those of Professor Gauss, a well-known mathematician ot eminence, and Professor Fuchs, a clinical teacher; and as examples of brains of ordinary persons, those of a woman of 29 and a workman named Krebs, all of which he examined and measured with scrupulous care. The general result of R. Wagner's researches upon these and other brains may be stated to be as follows :—1st. Although the greatest number of brains belonging to men of superior intellect are found to be heaviest or largest, yet there are so many instances in which the brains of such persons have not surpassed, or have even fallen below the average size of the brains of ordinary persons, that superiority of size cannot in the present state of our knowledge be regarded as a constant accompaniment of superiority of intellect, even when due regard has been paid to the comparative stature and other circumstances of the individuals. 2nd. It would appear that in the brains of certain persons of superior intellect, the cerebral convolutions have been found more numerous and more deeply divided than in those of persons of ordinary mental endowments and without cultivation. But numerous exceptional instances are also found of paucity of convolu- tions coincident with superior intellect, which make it impossible at present to deduce any certain conclusion with respect to the relation between the number or extent of the convolutions and the intellectual manifestations in different persons. The careful measurement of all the convolutions and the intervening grooves in the four brains above mentioned has been carried out by the younger Wagner, and the tables and results of these measurements published by him as an appendix to his father's treatise. (Hermann Wagner, " Maasbestimmungen der Oberflache des Grossen Gehirns," &c., Cassel und Gottingen, 1864.) The following short table, extracted from Hermann Wagner's memoir, and simplified by the omission of small fractions and by the reduction of the measurements from square millimetres to English square inches, may give the reader some idea of the nature of the inquiry :— Comparative measurement of the extent of surface of the Convolutions of the Cerebrum and its lohes. Surface of each lobe separately. Free and deep surfaces of cerebrum. Who'e surface of Cerebrum. Frontal, Parietal. Occipital. Temporal. Free surface.

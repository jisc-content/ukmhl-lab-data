812 THE TONGUE. The arteries of the tongue are derived from the lingualis, with some small branches from the facial and ascending pharyngeal. With these the veins for the most part correspond.

The nerves of the tongue (exclusive of branches from the sympathetic nerves) are three : viz. the lingual or gustatory branch of the fifth pair, which supplies the papillae and mucous membrane of the fore part and sides of the tongue to the extent of about two-thirds of its surface; the lingual branch of the glosso-pharyngeal, which sends filaments to the mucous membrane at the base of the tongue, and especially to the papillae vallatse; and, lastly, the hypoglossal nerve, which is distributed to the muscles. (See the description of these nerves.) Eemak and Kolliker have dis- covered microscopic ganglia upon the expansion of the glosso-pharyngeal nerve, and in the sheep and calf upon the gustatory division of the fifth. Eemak thought that they had some relation to the glands, but Kolliker finds them on branches not con- nected with those organs.

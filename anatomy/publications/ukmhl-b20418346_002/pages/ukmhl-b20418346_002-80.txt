SIZE AND WEIGHT OF THE ENCEPHALON. In the following table illustrating the average weight of the adult male and female brain, the results obtained by Sims, Clendinning, Tiedemann, and J. Reid have been brought together in such a form as to exhibit in groups the most commonly prevailing weights; the numbers being also simplified by the omission of fractions. (Sims, " Medico-Chirurg. Trans.," vol, xix., pp. 353—7 ; Clendinniog, " Medico- Chirurg, Trans.," vol. xxi., pp. 59—68; Tiedemann, " Das Him des Negers," Heidelberg, 1837, pp. 6, 7; Keid, "London and Edinburgh Monthly Journal of Medical Science," April, 1843, p. 298, &c.)

According to this table, the maximum weight of the adult male brain, in a series of 278 cases, was 65 oz., and the minimum weight 34 oz. In a series of 191 cases, the maximum weight of the adult female brain was 56 oz., and the minimum 31 oz. ; the difference between the extreme weights in the male subject being no less than 31 oz., and in the female 25 oz. By grouping the cases together in the manner indicated by brackets, it is shown that in a very large proportion the weight of the male brain

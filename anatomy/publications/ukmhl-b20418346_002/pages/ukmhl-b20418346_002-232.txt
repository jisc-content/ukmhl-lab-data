720 THE EYE. tinuous with the pigmentary layer lining the choroid and the ciliary pro- cesses, and consists of several strata of small roundish cells filled with dark pigment. The colour of the iris depends on the pigment ; in the different shades of blue eye it arises from the black pigment of the posterior surface appearing more or less through the texture, which is only slightly coloured or is colourless ; and in the black, brown, and grey eye, the colour is due to the pigment scattered through the iris substance.

THE TONGUE. 806 numerous projections or eminences named papillce. They are found also upon the tip and free borders, where, however, they gradually become smaller, and disappear towards its under surface. These papillae are dis- tinguished into three orders, varying both in size and form. Fig. 563. â€”Papillae Surface op the Tongue, with the Fauces and Tonsils (from Sappey). 1, 2, circumvallate papillae; in front of 2, the foramen csecum ; 3, fungiform papillse ; 4, filiform and conical papillae ; 5, transverse and oblique rugae ; 6, mucous glands at the base of the tongue and in the fauces ; 7, tonsils ; 8, part of the epiglottis; 9, median glosso-epiglottidean fold or frsenum epiglottidis. The large or circumvallate papillj3e, from seven to twelve in number, are found on the back part of the tongue, arranged in two rows, which run obliquely backwards and inwards, and meet towards the foramen csecum, like the arms of the letter V. They are situated in cup-like cavities or depres- sions of the mucous membrane, and have the shape of an inverted cone, of which the apex is attached to the bottom of the cavity, and the broad flattened base appears on the surface. They are therefore surrounded by a

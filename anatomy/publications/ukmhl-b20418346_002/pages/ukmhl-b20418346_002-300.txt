THE TEETH. 7S6 Fig. 5i5. A Examined under the micro- scope, dentine is seen to consist of an immense number of veiy fine tubes, inabedded closely together in a hard intertubular matrix, and having the appear- ance of possessing distinct parie- tes. These dental tuhules open at their inner ends into the pulp cavity, the wall of which pre- sents very numerous minute ori- fices over the whole of its inner surface. From thence they pass in a radiated manner Fig. 515.—SEcriojrs of Dentine (from KoUiker). A, highly magnified cross sections of the tnbnli of dentine. — a, from a part in which the tubuli are very closely set; h, from a part where they are widely set. B, longitudinal section of the root. ^ a, the dental tubes near the inner surface of the dentine with few tubuli; b, subdivision of tubuli; c, looped disposition of the tubuK ; d, granular layer consisting of small dental glo- bules at the margin of the dentine ; e, lacunse of the cement, one of them connected by tubuli with those of the dentine. through every part of the ivory towards its periphery. In the upper portion of the crown they have a vertical direction ; but towards the sides, and in the neck and root, they become gradually oblique, then hori- zontal, and are finally even lq- clined downwards towards the point of the fang. The course of the tubules is not straight, but each describes, in passing from the central to the peri- pheral part of the dentine, two or three gentle curves (primary curvatures, Owen), and is be- sides bent throughout its whole length into numerous fine undu- lations, which follow closely one upon another ; these are the secondary curvatures.

TABLE OF THE WEIGHT OF THE BRAIN. 569 ranges between 46 oz. and 53 oz., and that of the female brain between 41 oz. and 47 oz. The prevailing weights of the adult male and female brain may therefore be said to range between those terms; and by taking the mean, an average weight is deduced of 49^ oz. for the male, and of 44 oz. for the female brain,—results which correspond closely with the statements generally received. Although many female brains exceed in Aveight particular male brains, the general fact is sufficiently shown, that the adult male encephalon is heavier than that of the female,—the average difference being from 5 to 6 oz. This general superiority in absolute weight of the male over the female brain has been ascertained to exist at every period of life. In new-born infants the brain was found by Tiedemann to weigh on an average from 14| oz, to 15| oz. in the male, and from 10 oz. to 131 oz. in the female :—a fact of considerable interest in practical midwifery, for it has heen shown that difficult labours occur in by far the largest number in the birth of male children. (Simpson, London and Edinburgh Monthly Journal of Medical Science, 1845.) With the above results the observations of Peacock, published in the " Monthly Journ. of Med. Science " for 1847, and further observations by the same author in the " Journ. of the Pathol. Soc." in 1860, in the main agree. The elaborate table compiled by Rudolph Wagner, and published in his " Yorstudien zu einer Wissensch. Morphol. und Physiol, des Menschl. Gehirns," 1860, containing 964 recorded cases in which the weight of the brain had been ascertained, may also be referred to as another recent useful contribution to the knowledge of this subject. In illustration of the variation in the average weight of the brain at different ages the following table is given, deduced from the elaborate researches of Dr. Robert Boyd, in the examination of the brains of 2,086 sane persons of both sexes dying in the St. Marylebone Infirmary, and published in the Philos. Trans, for I860.. The weights are stated in oz. avoird. and decimal fractions of them. TaUe of the Weight of the Brain of Males and Females at different Ages.

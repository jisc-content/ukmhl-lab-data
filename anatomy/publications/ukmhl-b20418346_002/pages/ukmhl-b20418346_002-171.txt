THE LUMBAR PLEXUS AND NERVES. 659 The branches of this plexus form two sets, which are distributed, one to the lower part of the wall of the abdomen, the other to the fore part and inner side of the lower limb. In the former set are the ilio-hypogastric and Fig. 436. â€” Diagrammatic Outline op the Lumbar AND Sacral Plexuses with THE PRINCIPAL NeRVES Fig. 436. Dxn ARISING FROM THEM.

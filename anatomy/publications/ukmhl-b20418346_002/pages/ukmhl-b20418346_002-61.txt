549 PARTS SEEN IN THE LATERAL VENTRICLES. upper and back part of the third ventricle. The existence of this canal, named the canal of Bichat, is no longer admitted. The velum having been removed, the optic thalami are brought fully into view, together with the cavity of the third ventricle situated between them, while, behind the third ventricle, between it and the upper surface of Fig. 375. Fig. 375.—Dissection op the Brain from above, exposing the Lateral, Third and Fourth Ventricles, with the sdrroundinq parts (from Hirschfeld and Leveille). ^ a, the anterior part or knee of the corpus callosum divided ; its fibres are seen spreading on each side into the cerebral hemispheres; h, anterior part of the surface of the rigbt corpus striatum in the anterior cornu of the lateral ventricle ; b', the same on the left side, in which the grey substance has been dissected so as to show the peduncular medul- lary fibres spreading through the corpus striatum into the cerebral hemisphere ; c, points by a line to the taenia semicircularis ; d, surface of the thalamus opticus ; e, the anterior pillars of the fornix divided ; below they are seen descending in front of the third ven- tricle, and between them is seen a part of the anterior commissure ; above the letter is seen the fifth ventricle represented as a slit between the two laminae of the septum lucidum ;/, placed on the soft or middle commissure ; g, in the posterior part of the third ventricle ; on either side of this letter is the white stria or peduncle of the pineal gland; immediately below the letter is the small posterior commissure and the pineal gland ; A, the upper, and i, the lower of the corpora quadrigemina ; Tc, processus a cerebello ad cerebrum ; and close to this the valve of Vieussens, which is partly divided by a median incision along with the middle lobe of the cerebellum, so as to open up the fourth ven- tricle ; Z, the hippocampus major and corpus fimbriatum separated from the posterior pillar of the fornix and descending into the middle cornu of the lateral ventricle ; m, posterior cornu of the lateral ventricle and hippocampus minor ; n, eminentia collateralis; 0, the cavity of the fourth ventricle ; p, posterior surface of the medulla oblongata ; r, section of the middle lobe showing the arbor vit»; s, upper surface of the cerebellum brought into view on the left side by the removal of a considerable part of the posterior cerebral lobe.

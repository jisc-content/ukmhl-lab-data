INFLECTIONS OF THE PLEITR/E. 893 tinal partition, and are reflected each upon the root and over the entire free surface of the corresponding lung. Each pleura consists of a visceral and a ^Hiricia^ portion : the visceral portion, pleura ^ndmonalis, covers the lung ; and the parietal portion lines the ribs and intercostal spaces, pleura custalisj covers the upper convex surface of the diaphragm, enters into the formation of the mediastinum, and is reflected on the sides of the pericardium. The mediastinum or partition betvsreen the two pleural cavities, is formed by the reflection of each pleura from the anterior wall of the chest back- wards on the pericardium to the root of the lung, and from the back of the root of the lung to the vertebral column. Its division into anterior, middle, Fig. 626. Fig. 626.â€”Transverse Section op the Chest of a Fcetus, illustrating the Inflec- tions OF the Pericardium and Pleura (after Luschka aad from nature). The sketch represents the upper surface of the lower sectioa ; the division is carried nearly in a horizontal plane on a level with the interval in front between the fifth and sixth ribs, s, the sternum ; c, the body of the seventh dorsal vertebra ; h, the right, and h', the left ventricle; ce, the oesophagus; pn, the left pneumogastric nerve ; near these letters respectively, the root of the right and left lungs; the right pneumogastric nerve is behind the oesophagus ; a, the aorta ; v a, the vena azygos; d, thoracic duct ; 1, the cardiac pericardium; 2, the external pericardium; 2', the cavity of the peri- cardium ; 3, the pulmonary pleura passing over the surface, and reflected at the roots of the lungs ; 3', their cavity, and on the right side, the reflection at the mediastinum to the surface of the pericardium ; 4, the external or costal pleurae ; c, c, the walls of the chest inclosing the ribs, pectoral muscles, &c. and posterior meJiastina, and the position and contents of each, have been already described (p. 297).

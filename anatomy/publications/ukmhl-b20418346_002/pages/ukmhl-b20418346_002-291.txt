OLFACTORY NERVE. 777 and as they descend become very indistinct. The nerves of the outer wall are divided into two groups—the posterior branches being distributed over the surface of the upper spongy bone, and the anterior branches descending over the plane surface of the ethmoid and the middle spongy bone. Fig. 536. Fig. 536.—Nerves of the Septum Nasi, seen from the right side (from Sappey after Hirschfeld and Leveille). -| I, the olfactory bulb; 1, the olfactory nerves passing through the foramina of the cribriform plate, and descending to be distributed on the septum ; 2, the internal or septal twig of the nasal branch of the ophthalmic nerve; 3, naso-palatine nerves. The olfactory nerves as they descend ramify and unite in a plexiform manner, and the filaments join in brush-like and flattened tufts, which, spreading out laterally and communicating freely with similar oflsets on Fig. 537.—Nerves OP the Outer Wall op the Nasal Foss^ (from Sappey after Hirschfeld and Leveille). § 1, network of the branches of the olfac- tory nerve, descending upon the region of the superior and middle turbinated bones ; 2, external twig of the ethmoidal branch of the nasal nerve ; 3, spheno-palatine ganglion; 4, ramification of the anterior palatine nerves ; 5, posterior, and 6, middle divi- sions of the palatine nerves ; 7, branch to the region of the inferior turbinated bone ; 8, branch to the region of the superior and middle turbinated bones ; 9, naso-palatine branch to the septum cut short. each side, form a fine net-work, with elongated and narrow intervals between the points of junction ; but it is impossible to trace by dissection the termination of the nerves in the membrane, in consequence of the difficulty of recognising the filaments, destitute of dark outline, as they lie among the other nucleated tissues. In their nature the olfactory filaments difi'er much from the fibres of the cerebral and spinal nerves: they contain no white substance of Schwann, Fig. 537.

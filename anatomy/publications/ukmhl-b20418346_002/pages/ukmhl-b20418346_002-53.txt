541 THE CORPUS CALLOSUM. rounded on all sides by the grey matter which is seen to follow closely the convoluted surface, and to be of nearly equal thickness at all points. This white central mass in each hemisphere was named by Vicq-d'Azyr centrum ovale minus. On separating the remaining portions of the two hemispheres from each other, two sulci are seen to exist between the corpus callosum and the gyri immediately in contact with it, viz., the gyrus fornicatus of each side. These sulci were distinguished by the older anatomists as ventticles of the corpus callosum. Another section being made at the level of the corpus callosum, the white substance of that part is seen to be continuous with the internal medullary matter of both hemispheres : and the large white medullary mass thus displayed, surrounded by the border of cortical substance, constitutes what is generally described as the centrum ovale of Vieussens. The corpus callosum or great commissure (trabs cerebri) is a white struc- ture, with a length not quite half of that of the brain, and approaching about two-fifths nearer to the front than the back of the hemispheres.

Its thickness is greater at the ends than in the middle, and is greatest behind,

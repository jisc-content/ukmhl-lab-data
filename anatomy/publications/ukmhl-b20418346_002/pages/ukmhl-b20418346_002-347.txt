These oblique fibres are continuous with the layer of circular fibres of the gullet ; they embrace the cardiac orifice on the left, where they form a considerable stratum, and from that point descend obliquely upon the Fig. 580*,â€”Sketch OF THE Distri- bution OP Mus- cular Fibres in THE Stomach (af- ter Pettigrew and from nature). | A, external layer of longitudinal fi- bres, as seen from the outside ; B, middle layer of cir- cular fibres as seen on removing the longitudinal layer; C, deepest layer of oblique fibres as seen from within, after inverting the stomach, and remov- ing the mucous membrane : c, the cardiac end ; p, the pyloric end ; in A, the stronger longi- tudinal fibres pass- ing along the lesser and greater curva- tures, and all round the pyloric end are shown, and the radi- ating fibres spread- ing from the root of the gullet over the front and back of the stomach ; in B, the nearly uniform layer of circular fibres in two sets crossing each other very obliquely and becoming con- centric at the car- diac end to the cen- tre of the great cul- de-sac ; in C, the very oblique bands of fibres which form a continuation of the circular fibres of the gullet and spread in two sets, 0, one from the right and the other from the left side of the car- dia (also partially re- presented in B),pass- ing over the front and back of the stomach (except its lesser cur- vature) as far as the pyloric end.

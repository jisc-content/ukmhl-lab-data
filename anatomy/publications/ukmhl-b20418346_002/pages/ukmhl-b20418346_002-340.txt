The peritoneum or serous membrane of the abdominal cavity is by far the most extensive and complicated of the serous membranes. Like the others it may be considered to form a shut sac, on the outside of which are placed the viscera which it covers. In the female, however, the two Fallopian tubes open at their free extremities into the cavity of the peritoneum. The internal surface is free, smooth, and moist, and is covered by a thin squamous epithelium. The external or attached sur- face adheres partly to the parietes of the abdomen and pelvis, and partly to the outer surface of the viscera situated within them. The parietal portion is connected loosely with the fascia lining the abdomen and pelvis by means of a layer of areolar tissue, distinct from the abdominal fasciae, and named the sub-peritoneal or retro-peritoneal layer ; but it is more firmly adherent along the middle line of the body in front, as well as to the under surface of the diaphragm. The visceral portion, which is thinner than the other, forms a more or less perfect investment to most of the abdominal and pelvic viscera. The folds of the peritoneum are of various kinds. Some of them, constituting the mesenteries, connect certain portions of the intestinal canal with the posterior wall of the abdomen ; they are, the mesentery properly so called for the jejunum and ileum, the meso-csecum, transverse and sig- moid meso-colon, and the meso-rectum. Other duplicatures, which are called omenta, proceed from one viscus to another ; they are distinguished as the great omentum, the small omentum, and the gastro-splenic omentum. Lastly, certain reflexions of the peritoneum from the walls of the abdomen or pelvis to viscera which are not portions of the intestinal canal, are named liga- ments : these include the ligaments of the liver, spleen, uterus, and bladder.

THE LIVER. 874 seen. The cells also contain very fine granular or vesicular molecules. In many cases too the cells of the human liver and of that of quadrupeds have larger and smaller semi- ^'S- transparent fat globules in their interior. Their nu- cleus is frequently quite in- distinguishable ; and not unfrequently, on the other hand, cells are observed ■which are provided with two separate nuclei. They are massed in rows or streaks between the vessels, and, in sections made at right angles to the intra- lobular veins, appear as if Fig, 611.—A Small Portion OP A Lobule op the Human LiVEK HIGHLY MAGNIFIED, SHOWING THE HePATIC CeLLS IN Connection and the Ca- pillary Spaces between THEM (from Kolliker). l^o Fig. 612.

When ex- amined with a higher mag- nifying power, they are observed to form a con- tinuous web, or solid net- work, the more obvious occupied by the capillaries with which the Beale states that these cells often appear to be collections of viscid matter around central nuclei, without any distinct cell-wall; but this is open to question. According to Schiflf (quoted by Henle), the molecules contained within the hepatic cells consist of the amyloid substance, which is formed in the liver, and from which the glucose obtained from this organ is derived. The hepatic cells may be washed away from thin sections by dilute solu- tions of caustic potash, and then the spaces which they occupied are emptied, and the network of capillaries with which they were interlaced is brought more clearly into view, as was pointed out by Rainey ; and likewise, accord- ing to Henle, narrow bands, which he regards as formed of connective tissue, are to be seen crossing the spaces.

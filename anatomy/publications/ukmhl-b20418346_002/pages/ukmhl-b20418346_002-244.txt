Fig. 482.â€”Vertical Section of a Part of the Eyeball, showing the' Connections of THE Cornea, Sclerotic, Iris, Ciliary Muscle, Hyaloid, and Lens, f The full description of this figure will be found at p. 720 : the following references apply to the lens and parts connected with it. A, the anterior aqueous chamber in front of the pupil; ap, the recess forming the posterior division of the aqueous chamber, the iris resting between this and the pupil on the surface of the lens ; ir, radiating fibres of the iris or dilatator. pupill83 muscle ; io, orbicular fibres or sphincter muscle ; u, pigment layer of the iris or uvea; In, the lens at its centre; Ic, its capsule; he, granular or cellular layer in front of the lens : this layer is seen to terminate abruptly at the margin of the lens, where the new fibres of the lens are developed, and from whence the nuclei of the fibres extend for a certain depth inwards in an irregular plane in the growing lens; h, the hyaloid membrane; Z, the zonule of Zinn ; P, the canal of Petit; II, in front of it the suspensory ligament of the lens ; A', the part of the hyaloid which closes the canal of Petit behind and extends to the posterior surface of the lens ; V, the vitreous humour. nuclear granules" at their point of junction. (Bowman.) It is still doubtful how far the appearances of lamination produced by the action of chromic acid, or of radiated fibrillation resulting from congelation, are true indications of any actually existing structure in the interior of the vitreous humour. The fluid collected from the vitreous body by puncturing it resembles water : it contains, however, some salts with a little albumen.

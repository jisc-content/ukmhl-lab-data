547 TEAJTSVERSE FISSURE OF THE CEREBRUM. halves of the fornix, between which a triangular portion of the corpus callosum appears, marked with transverse, longitudinal, and oblique lines. To this part the term lyra has been applied. The transverse fissure of the cerebrum is the passage by which the pia mater passes from the surface into the ventricles of the brain to form the choroid plexus. It may be laid open in its whole extent, after the lateral ventricles have been opened, by completely dividing the fornix and corpus callosum in the middle line, and raising the divided parts from the undis- turbed velum interpositum below. It will then be found that, in like manner, the posterior and middle lobes of the brain, including hippocampus major and corpus fimbriatum, may be raised from the subjacent parts as far as the extremity of the descending cornu of the lateral ventricle. The transverse fissure is, therefore, a fissure extending from the extremity of the Fig. 374.

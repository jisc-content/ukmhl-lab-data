661 GEN"ITO-CRUE.AL NERVE. It often bifurcates close to its origin from tlie plexus, in which, case its two branches perforate the psoas muscle in different places. (a) The genital branch (external spermatic, Schmidt), lie-s upon or near the external iliac artery, and sends filaments along that vessel; then perforating the transversalis fascia, it passes through the inguinal canal with the spermatic cord, and is lost upon Fig. 437. 4 Fig. 437.â€”View from before of the Anterior Branches of the Lumbar and Sacral Nerves with the Plexuses (from Sappey after Hirschfeld and Leveille). ^ 1, lumbar cord of the great sympathetic nerve ; 2, 2', anterior primary division of the twelfth dorsal nerve ; 3, first lumbar ; 4, 4', ilio-inguinal bvanch of this nerve; 5, 5', ilio-hypogastric branch; 6, second lumbar nerve ; 7, 7', genito-crural nerve rising from the first and second lumbar ; 8, 8', external cutaneous nerve of the thigh ; 9, third lumbar nerve; 10, fourth; 11, fifth; 12, lumbo-sacral trunk; 13, iliac branch of the ilio-inguinal; 14, its abdominal branch; 15, its genital branch; 16, external cutaneous nerve of the right side passing out of the pelvis under Poupart's ligament ; 17, 17, 17, cutaneous ramifications of this nerve ; 17', the same nerve exposed on the left side ; 18, 18', genital branch of the genito-crural; 19, its crural branch on the right side becoming cutaneous ; 19', the same on the left side exposed as it descends in front of the femoral artery ; 20, anterior crural nerve ; 21, 21', obturator nerve ; 22, left sciatic plexus ; 23, aortic plexus of the sympathetic nerve connected superiorly with the other pre-aortic plexuses and the lumbar ganglia, and inferiorly with the hypogastric plexus.

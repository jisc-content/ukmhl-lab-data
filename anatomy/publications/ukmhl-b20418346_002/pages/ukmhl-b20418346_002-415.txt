901 MINUTE STRUCTURE OF THE AIR-CELLS. presence of nuclei, however, situated in the capillary meshes, and of larger size than those -which belong to the capillary walls, is allowed on all hands; and the majority of recent observers declare the existence of exceedingly Fig. 629. Fig. 629.—Diagrams Illustrating the Progressive Advance in the Cellular Structure of the Lungs oe Reptiles. A, the upper portion of the king of a serpent : the summit has cellular walls, the lower part forms merely a membranous sac, B, lung of the frog, in which the cellular structure extends over the whole internal surface of the lung, but is more marked at the upper part. C, lung of the turtle : the cells here have extended so as to occupy nearly the whole thickness of the lung. delicate squamous epithelial cells. These, according to Eberth, lie in the capillary meshes, from one to three in each, but leave the surfaces of the capillary vessels uncovered. According to others they join each other over the capillary blood-vessels. Fig. 630. Fig. 630.—Fragment op the Injected Lung op a Young Pig, showing the Minute Structure op the Vesicles (from Hirschmann and Chrzonszczewsky). a, the areolar and elastic tissue supporting the vesicles; b, the cavities of two of the vesicles partially cut through ; c, the meshes of the pulmonary capillaries, the latter being filled with dark colouring matter, and the meshes being occupied by regular hexagonal epithelial cells, which in various places are seen to meet each other over the capillary vessels ; rf, the intervesicular pulmonary vessels. In this instance the cells observed in each mesh have been more numerous than they are said by Eberth to be in the human subject.

MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS 9C with serum. When, however, the acid gas was con- densed in serum, there was a decided effect, a coagu- lation was occasioned,—a transparent jelly formed,— which appeared to be quite insoluble in water, and not liable to putrefy. The effects of the mineral acids,—the muriatic, nitric, and sulphuric, vary with their degree of solu- tion. Equal parts of muriatic acid and water, coagu- late serum as readily as the strong acid; but, when diluted with six parts of water, the effect was scarcely visible. Nitric acid, largely diluted, has a distinct effect; thus, one part of this acid to thirty parts of water, had rather more visible effect, than the muriatic with six of water ; with twenty of water the serum was rendered very turbid. The alkaline earths, lime and magnesia, have, ap- parently, no effect on serum. Baryta, mixed with serum, formed, with it, a firm semi-transparent jelly. A few hours were required for the combination to take place. In the instance of lime and magnesia, no change was perceived either immediately or after many hours. Of the salts, some, as the sulphate of copper, the sulphate of zinc, coagulated serum, or occasioned a precipitation of its albumen, and even when ex- tremely diluted. The super-tartrate of potash, in solution, rendered it turbid. Others, as nitrate of barytes, oxalate of ammonia, borax, triple prussiate of potash, chlorate of potash,—the neutral salts, did not disturb its transparency.

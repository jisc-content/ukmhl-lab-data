llf) MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS which material particles are without cessation dying and reviving. Farther, in prosecution of the argument, it may be said, that the blood considered chemically, how- ever extraordinary, is not without analogy, and that some vegetable juices make a near approach to it in their proneness to change, and in the tendency of their elements to enter into new combinations. Witness the juice of the grape and most of the other saccharine vegetable juices, which at a certain temperature, like the blood, can only exist in their proper vessels and receptacles. The instant they are abstracted the process of fermentation begins, and that even in close vessels, and though oxygen be excluded, as it appears to me, I have proved by experiment. Here then, we have an instance of change as great as that which the blood undergoes, when drawn from the body, spontaneously taking place amongst the elements of dead matter. If it be said, that the vegetable juices possess vegetable life, by which they are preserved in their vessels, and that they are to be considered only as dead when expressed, and when in consequence they are liable to fermentation, another instance free from such objection may be substituted, viz. a solution of crystallized sugar, which is subject to the same change on admixture with a little leaven,â€”the leaven itself, it would appear, undergoing no change in the act of exciting fermentation. The subject may be considered under many other

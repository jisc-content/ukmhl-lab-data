412 ON MACERATION IN WATER, ETC. modified by the removal mechanically by the water of the particles detached, and not dissolved. I have ascertained that the same gases are disengaged from the different textures during putrefaction in the at- mosphere, and during maceration or putrefaction in water; and as far as I am able to judge from a slight examination, the insoluble debris, generally resulting in both, does not materially differ. The most striking difference which occurs in considering the two processes is in relation to time, most parts undergoing change more rapidly in the air than in the water, that is, when there is as free an access of air as of water. The difference is probably owing to the water removing a substance which may be called animal leaven, very apt to decompose itself, and to promote the decomposition of animal and vegetable matter with which it may be mixed, and which abounds in, and forms a considerable part of all the textures liable to change, and exists more sparingly in those parts which are slow in changing.

TEXTURES OF THE HUMAN BODY. 295 separable from the cutis vera, and how, in the art of tanning, it is applied to this purpose. The hu- man cuticle, that, for instance, of the sole of the foot, I find, becomes soft and gelatinous from im- mersion in lime and water. After drying, a portion thus tried, (well washed previous to drying) was white, semi-transparent and brittle; incinerated, it yielded seventeen per cent, of ash, which consisted principally of lime and carbonate of lime. The effect of lime on nail is similar to that which it exercises on cuticle, but not so strongly marked. A portion of nail of great toe, macerated in lime and water, from the 7th of June to the 18th August, was rendered soft and friable,—a little swollen and disposed to separate or break up in layers. Dried, it exhibited the same character as cuticle, and when incinerated, burned in a similar manner, and left a considerable ash, consisting of a small proportion of phosphate of lime, which pre-existed in the nail, and a large proportion of lime,—with which, during the change from maceration, it may be inferred, it com- bined. On hair, the effect of lime appears to be more destructive ; but, in what manner it acts, I have not attempted to ascertain. A portion of human hair of the head, which had been kept in lime and water about three months was partially decomposed. At the bottom of the vessel there was a little black sediment. The hair, which was black, had acquired a just perceptible reddish shade1, and had become

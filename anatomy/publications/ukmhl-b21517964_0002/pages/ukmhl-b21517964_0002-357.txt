AIR ON DEAD ANIMAL MATTER. 345 ammoniacal odour. The experiment was then inter- rupted by excluding atmospheric air; the froth sub- sided, the larvsB died, and the temperature of the part fell to that of the water. A similar experiment was made with the ventricular portion of the heart of the same subject, and with precisely similar re- sults. Other experiments have been made in a somewhat different form, and results have been ob- tained also somewhat different. When flies have been excluded, muscle has undergone a compara- tively slow change; it has gradually softened, become unctuous, acquired a peculiar odour, lost its cohesion, and has become converted into a reddish semifluid, not unlike chyme, with a very strong ammoniacal odour. In one instance, this change took place between the 6th and the 21st of August. The tem- perature was not elevated more than 2° at its maxi- mum. When the muscular fibre was unravelled, and an extensive surface exposed to the air, the change was very much more rapid ; the conversion of muscle into poultaceous fluid took place in six days, and the temperature was elevated 7°. Brain.—I shall give two different experiments made on this organ entire, or nearly so, deprived of its membranes, belonging to bodies No. 1, and 2. That on No. 2, was commenced on the 14th July. On the 15th, its temperature, and that of the water were the same, viz. 76°. On the 16th, at its sur- face, it had risen 3°; whilst the deeply seated por- tions varied according to their depth, from 2° to 1°.

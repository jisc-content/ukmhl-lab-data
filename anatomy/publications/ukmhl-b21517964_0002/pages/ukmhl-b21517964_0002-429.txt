THEORY OF MEMBRANES. 417 of a classification of membranes into distinct, de- finite species was derived; is it true, (adopting his distinction of membranes) that under the in- fluence of disease, the same membrane throughout is uniformly affected; that similar membranes are similarly affected, and different membranes dis- similarly ? 2d, Relative to structure;—is it true, that there are certain simple elementary membranes,—as the mucous, the serous, the fibrous, &c. essentially dif- ferent ; analogous in the organic system to the chemical elements, as oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, &c. in the inorganic ? 3d, Relative to particular membranes;—to take an example; is it true, of the mucous, as Bichat maintains, that they possess an uninterrupted conti- nuity of similar structure throughout ? 1st, Of the pathological argument, — originally proposed by Dr. Carmichael Smith, adopted by Pinel, and elaborated by Bichat:—in the extensive generalization to which Bichat carried it, and which was necessary for his grand views, are there not many well established facts opposed to it ? If his generalization were correct, would not the spreading of organic disease and its isolation be very different from what it is found to be ? Would the inflam- mation and ulceration of dysentery be confined to the large intestines ? Would there be local inflamma- tions, and ulcerations,—not confined to any particular texture in which they commenced,—not spreading VOL. II. EE

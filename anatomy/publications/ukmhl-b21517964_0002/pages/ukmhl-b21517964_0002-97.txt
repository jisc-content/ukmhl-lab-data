85 ON THE BLOOD. proportion than common of solid matter. One leech, which I tried in Malta, in May 1830, gorged with blood, was of specific gravity 108*7 ; cut into two, and deprived of blood, one moiety was of specific gravity 1062; the other of specific gravity 1054; the latter was the caudal portion. This leech, dis- tended with blood, weighed 161*4 grs. Another, smaller, which distended with blood weighed only 18-4 grs. was with the blood of specific gravity 1076, and empty, or very nearly so, of specific gravity 1051. Blood abstracted from the arm, from a patient labouring under an inflammatory complaint, of specific gravity 1061, and which after coagulation was slightly buffed, yielded on evaporation to per- fect dryness 20'7 per cent, solid matter. Blood abstracted from the same patient from the scrobi- culus cordis by a large leech, similarly evaporated, yielded 22*3 per cent. Now is it not probable, that these peculiarities of the blood abstracted by leeches is connected with the size of the aperture, and the effects of the pumping force exercised by the animal ? That the latter influence is concerned, at least in part, may I think be inferred from the cir- cumstance, that the blood which flows from the wound after the removal of the leech, commonly coagulates more readily and firmly than the blood procured from the leech itself. The blood ex- tracted by the mosquito, is again different in cha- racter from that by the leech. It coagulates readily, and is not deficient in fibrin.

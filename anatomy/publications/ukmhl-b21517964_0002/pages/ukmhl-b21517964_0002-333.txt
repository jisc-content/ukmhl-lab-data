TEXTURES OF THE HUMAN BODY. 321 2. Dura mater, was thickened, rendered more transparent and elastic ; it was easily stretched and broken. Its outer surface was shrivelled. It ad- mitted of being easily divided into two laminae; the exterior of which was thinnest. The direction of the fibres was horizontal. No appearance of arach- noid membrane, or of a membrane reflected over its inner surface was perceptible. 3. The external investing membrane of the heart was rendered soft and imperfectly gelatinous. 4. The lining membrane of the cavities of the heart was rendered slightly gelatinous. 5. The cordae tendineae were rendered soft, not in the slightest degree viscid, but very friable ; they were pellucid and like cold jelly. 6. The valves appeared contracted and corru- gated ; they were very friable, and slightly gelatinous; their base was more so than their free margin. 7. The muscular substance of the heart was ren- dered very friable and soft. It showed a disposition to come away in spiral masses, when pulled asunder. 8. The outer coat of the pulmonary artery and of the aorta was rendered softer, and somewhat gelatinous, and slightly viscid, so as to be slightly ropy when drawn out. It could be traced down to the valves; shewing, as it appears to me, and as is confirmed by the effect of maceration, that the semi- lunar valves of both great arteries are connected in part with this outer coat. 8. The middle coat of both vessels was rendered VOL. II. y

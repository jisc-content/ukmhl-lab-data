392 ON MACERATION IN WATER OF it appears to be very similar to that covering the upper surface of the tongue. Like that of the tongue, it varies in thickness and distinctness in dif- ferent parts. It is very thick on the roof of the mouth, and on the anterior and superior part of the tongue ; less thick on the sides of the mouth, or mid- dle part of the superior face of the tongue; hardly distinguishable on the surface of the fauces, and the back of the tongue, and not distinguishable on the floor of the mouth under the tongue, and on the in- ferior surface of this organ. About the third or fourth day, this epithelium began to come away, or was easily detached; but from no part as a conti- nuous membrane, rather like a curd-like substance, especially from the roof of the mouth. From the tongue, particularly the apex, it might be detached in small portions, having some resemblance to cuticle, and bearing the impression of the surface to which it had adhered. After the separation of its epi- thelium, the next remarkable change in the tongue from maceration, occurred in its muscular substance, which soon became soft and fetid, and in this poul- taceous state it was soon washed away in changing the water, when gentle pressure was at the same time made to it. After the removal of this part, there remained its case, as it were, which varied in texture in different parts. On the under surface it was a delicate membrane, apparently composed of cellular tissue, and which soon wasted away On the upper it had a mixed character, as if composed of tendon-like fibres, and of cellular tissue,â€”the for-

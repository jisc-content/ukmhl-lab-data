ON THE BLOOD. 3 mating and collecting in a mass, entangling the red particles and including a portion of the serum. Now, as generally, during the conversion of liquids into solids, the mere change of form is connected with a disengagement of heat, it might, perhaps, d priori, be expected, that a disengagement of heat would be witnessed during the occurrence of the phenomenon in question. Fourcroy has stated, that the effect of the blood's coagulation is attended with an elevation of several degrees of the thermometer.* Mr. Hunter, on the contrary, from his own experiments inferred that no heat is evolved on the occasion. The experiments, from which he deduced his conclusion, " that in the coagulation of the blood no heat is formed," were made on the blood of a comparatively cold-blooded animal, the turtle.t Notwithstanding the high au- thority of the inquirer, and the very favourable cir- cumstances under which his observations were made, his experiments have not been considered entirely conclusive. Dr. Thomson and the late Dr. Gordon, from their own observations, were averse from his opinion, and rather favoured that of Fourcroy,â€”in- duced to do so, as stated, by Dr. Gordon, in his Lectures on Physiology, from witnessing the process of cooling of the blood either retarded or quite interrupted at the time of coagulation. The consideration of these discrepancies induced * Ann. de Chimie, vii. p. 147. t Treatise on the Blood, &c. p. 28. B 2

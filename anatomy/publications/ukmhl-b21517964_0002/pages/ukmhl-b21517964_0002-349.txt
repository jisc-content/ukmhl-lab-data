AIR ON DEAD ANIMAL MATTER. 337 by absorption, together with the acid gas generated. In twenty-four hours or little more, the fibrin had become semifluid or poultaceous ; the oxygen of the air had disappeared entirely, or nearly so, and its place was supplied by carbonic acid gas, excepting a diminution (which it may be inferred was car- bonic acid gas absorbed) very nearly equal to the volume of the semifluid formed. As the putrefac- tive process proceeded, the fibrin divided into two parts—one poultaceous and a little frothy, occupying the spot where the fibrin was first put,—the other liquid, surrounding the poultaceous matter; and the volume of air gradually increased, carbonic acid gas being evolved, attended with the formation of am- monia and the other changes belonging to advanced putrefaction. I shall next mention the results obtained in similar trials on different textures taken from animals just killed, as the rabbit and ox,—or from the human subject a few hours after death. Paying as much attention as possible to uniformity of temperature, and watching the experiments carefully, I have never been able to observe any immediate absorp- tion of air. In several instances, as of muscle, liver, intestine, &c, there was no diminution but a pro- gressive increase of volume from the evolution of air. In the few instances in which a diminution of volume did take place, it was very inconsiderable; and ;is this was accompanied by incipient putrefaction, and generally attended with the appearance of some car- VOL.

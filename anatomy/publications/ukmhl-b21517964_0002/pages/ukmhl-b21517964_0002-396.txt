384 ON THE MACERATION IN WATER OF component fibres not distinguishable except on very minute examination of the debris. The middle coat became soft later than the preceding ; it wasted irre- gularly, became full of holes and gradually fell to pieces. During the change, the outer coat assumed a brownish hue ; the hue of the inner coat was little altered ; the middle coat assumed a bright pink colour. The different arteries exhibited some varie- ties of change ; the pulmonary artery underwent it slowest; the aorta of No. 5 which was diseased, also underwent change very slowly, and in a peculiar manner. The inner coat separated from the middle, and the middle in places from the adjoining fibrous coat, and the middle coat where thickest separated into laminae. These alterations took place in a space of time varying from six weeks to eight months. It may not be amiss to remark, that by the fibrous coat of the artery, I mean that which is next to the middle, and between it and the loose cellular texture, the envelope of the vessel in which there is generally some fatty matter, and which appears to be even less liable to change than the fibrous, but subject to the same kind of alteration. Veins—Vena cava (4. 5.) — It gradually soft- ened ; the outer cellular or fibrous coat preceding a little in its change the proper coat or coats of the vein. The softening and wasting process went on irre- gularly ; one portion suffering greatly, and another ad- joining very little ; and the kind of change was not always the same in the same texture ; here a spot

ACTION OF LIME ON THE 294 that after animal substances have been fully sub- jected to the action of lime, they ceased to be putrescent ; they resisted putrefaction, whether placed in air, or plunged and kept in common water. I shall mention one instance. On the 13th of May, 1830, a portion of ileum, with mesentery attached, and a portion of muscular part of heart, with chordae tendineae, were placed in a large jar of transparent lime water, and covered with cerate cloth. Examined nine months after, on the 16th of February, they were found in good preservation, and without any putrid or unpleasant odour. The only change per- ceptible was, that the portion of heart and intestine had acquired a light greenish hue and the tendon an opalescent hue; and all were a little softened. A crust of carbonate of lime had formed on the water, which still retained some caustic lime. They were then transferred to a jar of common waterâ€” where, after four days, they continued unaltered. I may add, that a portion of cutis, similarly treated, placed in confined air in a bottle, after a whole month, emitted no unpleasant odour, and appeared to be unchanged. I have observed, that cuticle, nail, and perhaps hair, are to be excluded from the list of animal sub- stances, not materially altered by the action of lime. On the cuticle its action is powerful, and, I appre- hend, in consequence of a chemical combination between them being formed. It is well known how lime has the property of rendering the cuticle easily

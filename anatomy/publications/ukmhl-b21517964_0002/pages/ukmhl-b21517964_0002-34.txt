22 EXPERIMENTS AND OPSERVATIONS exists in the blood and no such fluid as coagulable lymph ; but a liquor sanguinis, not capable, com- patibly with health, of affording either serum alone, or lymph alone, and capable of being separated into serum and lymph or fibrin, only when removed from the circulation, and not under the influence of the laws of life. And in accordance with this view he considers the denomination of serous membrane im- proper. If serum were never found in closed cavities, without its due proportion of lymph (taking as a measure the albuminous part of each) then this view would be plausible ; but as this is not the case—as serum, differing very little in specific gravity from the serum of the blood, is not unfrequently to be found in such cavities, especially in the pericardium, unaccompanied by any lymph (as I have often satis- fied myself) or by the deposition of lymph in the form of a false membrane, the hypothesis appears to me untenable. Dr. Babington admits the facts I have alluded to in the latter part of his paper, where, contrary to what he advances in the first part of it, he has recourse, to explain them, to the ordinary doctrine of secretion. 5.— Observations on the Specific Gravity of Blood, Venous and Arterial, of different Ani- mals, and of different Ages, not including Man. As a preliminary, it may be right to mention the

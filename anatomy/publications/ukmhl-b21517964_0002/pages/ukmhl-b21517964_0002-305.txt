TEXTURES OF THE HUMAN BODY. 293 burned with a bright flame, without any unpleasant smell. The other parts were not distinguishable. * The second experiment recorded, was commenced in the beginning of October. Portions of aorta, dura mater, intestine, skin, cellular tissue, muscle and tendon, were similarly treated. The results were examined on the 5th of May following. Then, on opening the bottle, an ammoniacal but no putrid smell was perceptible. The parts were found well preserved, excepting the fatty matter contained in the cellular tissue, which had become of an opaque white and friable, from combination with the alkaline earth and conversion into soap. The tendon, it is mentioned, was somewhat distended and rendered more transparent, but not gelatinized; and so also, in a less degree, were the dura mater and cutis; and the last was deprived of its cuticle and hair. Some other experiments were made, but, as the results were very similar, it would be tedious to describe them. I may state, generally, that with the exception of cuticle, nail, and perhaps hair, lime exerted on the different textures, on which it was tried, no destructive power, but, a contrary influ- ence,â€”and more particularly a well marked anti- septic one. It has been stated, how certain parts in the first experiment, lost the putrid odour which they had acquired, when immersed in lime and water. Moreover, it appears from notes of experiments^

ON MACERATION IN WATER OF 39S substance formed on them ; they became eroded as it were, and more in some places than in others, and worn into holes; and the investing tissue of ducts, and gall-bladder became soft and incapable of re- sistance ; and thus gradually in from about six to eight months, they experienced a total disintegration, and were reduced to shreds and particles of a green- ish hue. Air Passages, (7- 9-)â€”Different parts of the as- pera arteria suffered change very variously in relation to time. In the instance of No. 7- on the twenty- first day, there was an appearance of erosion of the epiglottis, and a wasting of the lining membrane of the trachea, portions of which were in a shreddy state ; whilst the whole of the lining membrane of the larynx appeared to be unaltered, excepting the sac- culi laryngis, the loose tissue in which had become distended with water, producing an appearance like oedema; and the same was observable round the rima glottidis. In the instance of No. 9- on the twenty-eighth day, the erosion of the epiglottis was very similar, but the alteration in the trachea less. On the thirty-second day, (in this latter example, to which I shall now confine myself,) the lining mem- brane of the epiglottis was perforated with small holes, corresponding to glandules underneath, under- going decomposition, situated in the substance of the cartilage, and in the connecting tissue, perform- ing the part of its perichondrium ; and similar mi- nute perforations were formed in the lining mem-

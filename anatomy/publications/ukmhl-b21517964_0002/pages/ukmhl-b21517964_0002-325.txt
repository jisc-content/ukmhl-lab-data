313 XIV. ON THE EFFECTS OF BOILING WATER, AND OF BOIL- ING, ON THE TEXTURES OF THE HUMAN BODY AFTER DEATH. The majority of the experiments which I have to de- tail on this subject, were made in Malta, in 1828-29. They were instituted chiefly for the purpose of test- ing, in part, the correctness of Bichat's theory of membranes,â€”in the development of which, in com- paring different textures, he lays much stress on the effects in question. I shall first notice the effects witnessed from the application of boiling water to portions of different textures, of small bulk, so small as to have their temperature almost immediately elevated to that of the scalding medium. The trials were made in a very plain and easy manner. In each instance, the animal matter was placed in a Wedgewood-ware evaporating dish, and water boiling from the fire, in a common tea-kettle, was poured on it, in a continued stream, for a few seconds, until its own temperature, it was supposed, was imparted. 1.

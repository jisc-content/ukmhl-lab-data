21 ON THE BLOOD. chiefly on the circumstance of the uniformity of composition of the crassamentum in relation to fibrin. Granted that the crassamentum is uniform in this respect, that there is no accumulation of fibrin towards its bottom, and no deficiency of it towards the surface, it does not therefore follow that the fibrinous part, not even when liquid, as coagulable lymph, is of the same specific gravity as the serum with which it is equally mixed, and much less when solid. It might, it appears to me, as well be said, that the serum of the blood and water is each of the same specific gravity, because they are miscible, and that equally. The mere circumstance of the coagul- able lymph and serum being in intimate mixture, appears to me to be quite sufficient to account for the fact of the uniform composition of the crassa- mentum, admitting it to be so. Dr. Benjamin Babington has connected the above idea with some views peculiar to himself, relative to the liquid part of the blood, which I must confess do not appear to me to be well borne out by the facts. The opinion of Hewson and of Hunter appears to me more in harmony with them. They considered the fluid part of the blood an equable mixture of liquid lymph, and of serum ; both cap- able of being separated from the mass of the blood, apart, or together, under peculiar circumstances in health and disease; the one spontaneously coagulable, the other not. Dr. Benjamin Babington, on the contrary, is of opinion, that no such fluid as serum

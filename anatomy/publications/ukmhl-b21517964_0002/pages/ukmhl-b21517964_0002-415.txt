The mem- brane of the vitreous humour, before softening, has, like the cornea, acquired a slight degree of opacity, and in consequence has appeared so much the more distinct; it has resisted decomposition many weeks.

On the twelfth day, this coat was of a light pink hue, whilst the inner coat was white, firm, and apparently unaltered. On the eighteenth day, the inner partially began to soften. On the twenty-third day, all the different coats were softening; the peritoneal was white, the muscular pink, and the inner coat yellowish, with slimy matter of the same hue adhering to it. On the thirty-fifth day, they had all become very soft, and capable of resisting little force; and both the peritoneal sur- face, and the inner surface were slimy.

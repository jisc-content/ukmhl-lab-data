IN CONNEXION WITH RESPIRATION. 143 already mentioned, viz. the graduated tube with the mercurial pneumatic trough, and the double-mouthed bottle furnished with stop-cocks, &c. as being well adapted for simple and decisive experiments. By means of the graduated tube I have agitated venous blood in hydrogen over mercury, as about a cubic inch of each, and other proportions, and have left the blood exposed to the influence of the gas for several hours ; and I have made similar trials with it, using larger quantities in the double-mouthed bottle, as sixteen cubic inches of each, and also other proportions. The results have been either of the same negative character, or, if different, indicating only the disengagement of carbonic acid gas in an extremely minute quantity. In all the experiments with the graduated tube in which fresh blood was used, whether of man or of the sheep, the fibrin displaced out of the contact of the air, on agitation with hydro- gen, there was no sensible increase of the volume of the gas, and no diminution of it when it was trans- ferred to, and shaken with, lime-water. And in the best experiments, on a larger scale, with the double- mouthed bottle, when most attention was paid to all the circumstances likely to insure accuracy, (as in the first instance the exclusion of air from the blood, and in the second the having it of the temperature of the bottle and of the room,) the results have been similar, and negative. I shall describe a small num- ber of experiments, those, the results of which ap- peared least ambiguous.

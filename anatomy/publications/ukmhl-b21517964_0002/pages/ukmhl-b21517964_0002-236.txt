224 TRIALS WITH THE AIR-PUMP ON the like result; one examined 13 hours, the other, 20 hours after death. The deduction from these results is obvious : and, in relation to carbonic acid, as bile is an alkaline fluid, they are such as might be expected d priori. At page 211, I have mentioned, that on trial of bile, collected after death, in instances of disease, by agitation with common air, gas was frequently disengaged, which it was supposed was carbonic acid gas. In these examples, it is probable, that the dis- engagement witnessed, was owing to incipient decom- position of the fluid, connected with the putrefactive process. 3.— Of Synovia and of Serous Fluids. Recently, in two instances, I have subjected syno- via to the air-pump ; in both, it was taken from the human subject—in one, three hours after death—in the other, sixteen and a half. The trials were made, as already described, by introducing the fluid, as it flowed from the joint, through an appropriate opening into distilled water purged of air. In the first example, not a particle of air was disengaged. In the second, two or three very small particles only were separated, giving the idea of adventitious air, entangled during the passage of the fluid from the capsule to the vial; there was not the slightest general effervescence. At Corfu, also, I subjected synovia to the air-pump, in two different instances—the fatal cases referred to

242 THE AGE OF MORBID ADHESIONS ; vacuum or an approach to it, favourable to exhala- tion. Reasoning on the subject and considering the relative qualities of the parts concerned,—the heart, the pericardium, the pleura?, and lungs,—it appeared to me more probable, that the pericardium would rather lose fluid than gain it after death by exuda- tion, inasmuch as the external layer,—that dividing it from the pleura,—is a thinner boundary, and it may be supposed, more easily penetrated than the inter- nal, comprehending with it the muscular parieties of the heart and its inner lining. To endeavour to illustrate this view by experi- ments, I have had recourse to an aqueous solution of the triple prussiate of potash* (ferro-cyanuret of potassium). * The solution of this salt is peculiarly well fitted for the above purpose, both on account of the facility with which its presence may be detected in animal fluids, and its not apparently having any astringent or other effect on the delicate textures of the body. The experiments of Hering on the injection of this salt into the veins of horses may be adduced in proof and illustration; as may also some experiments which Dr. Wollaston made on the taking of the salt internally in the year 1798, and some others made by myself in 1823. From Professor Burdach's account of Hering's experiments given at page 344 of the 8th vol. of his Physiology, it appears that the prussiate was often detected in the substance of the kidneys, at the expiration of a minute after its injection into the vein; and that it ceased to be detected in the blood in from fifteen minutes to five hours,—although it continued appreciable in the urine very many hours longer, even two days.

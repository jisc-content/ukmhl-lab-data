222 TRIALS WITH THE AIR-PUMP ON similar trials on the blood,—then, on subjecting it to exhaustion when cooled, it remained perfectly tranquil, not a particle of air was disengaged, even when the vacuum was as complete as it could be made. At Corfu, I made also some experiments on the new laid egg of the common fowl, and with the same results; neither its white, nor its yolk afforded any air in vacuo. The trials were made on the white and yolk apart under water.* Are not these negative results in the instance of milk and the egg, such as might be expected, d priori, whether we take into consideration their source, or their composition, or the objects for which they are destined ? And, may they not in part tend to account for some of the peculiar qualities of each in their state of perfect newness, and for the superior wholesomeness of the former, when, as by nature it was intended, it is drawn by the infant or young ani- mal direct from the breast of the mother ?f * When the whole egg was immersed in water, and subjected to the air-pump, then indeed it gave off some air, as might be expected; adhering bubbles were detached from the outer surface of the shell generally; a current of bubbles, for several minutes, was poured out from two or three conspicuous pores in the large end of the egg—air, there is little doubt, which had entered through the same pores, during the cooling of the egg, and its consequent contraction,—which I infer from not finding any air in this part of the egg, when it has been put into water the instant it has been laid, and examined under water. f The air which milk rapidly absorbs, on exposure to the atmo- sphere, and which is promoted by the frothing in milking, and in the agitation it is commonly subjected to afterwards in various ways,

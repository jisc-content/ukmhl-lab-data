413 XVII. GENERAL REMARKS ON BICHAT'S THEORY OF MEM- BRANES IN CONNEXION WITH THE PRECEDING OBSERVATIONS. Bichat, in investigating the nature of membranes, paid attention to the effects of maceration, and in his Anatomie Generale, he has given the results of his experience. In some instances, I perceive the results which I obtained accord with his,—in others they vary slightly, and in some they materially dis- agree. I shall notice only one or two instances of the latter. He describes tendon as undergoing change pretty rapidly from maceration,—at least comparatively. He says, it undergoes change more rapidly than cellular tissue. And, he extends the remark to analogous textures, as to aponeurosis, and also to the cutis vera, and to cartilage: he expresses it as his opinion, that if the substance of these textures were disposed in five laminae, like cellular tissue, and not

EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS 26 density of the venous blood. It was long ago observed by Dr. Crawford, that arterial blood is apparently more liquid than venous ; if so, in realit y, which is probable, it may be partly owing to its being more dilute, as indicated by its specific gravity. The number of experiments on the specific gravity of the blood and serum of animals of different ages is hardly sufficiently large to allow of any satisfactory conclusion; they seem to indicate that the blood of adult animals is of greater specific gravity than that of youngâ€”an inference in accordance with analogy, and which Bryan Robinson, one of the ablest of the iatro-mathematical sect, many years ago deduced from his own experiments.* That the specific gravity of the blood of different animals varies, is manifest from the preceding table. The difficulty is to reply to the question, in what manner the variation accords with the nature or species of animals. As the degree of density of the blood appears to depend chiefly on the proportion of red particles; and as the use of the red particles seems to be con- nected less with nutrition than with action, accord- ing to the views of Hunter,f and more, I may add, with the production of animal heat, than perhaps with any other function, it is very probable, that the blood of birds is of greatest specific gravity, (vary- ing in degree according to the temperature of each * Vide Animal Economy, p. 245. t Hunter on the Blood, p. 431.

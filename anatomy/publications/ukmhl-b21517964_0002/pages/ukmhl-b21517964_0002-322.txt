310 EFFECTS OF TANNIN ON THE in weight in several instances, and the change of properties produced in all, tending to the preserva- tion of the part, with the exception of the cuticle, I think it may fairly be inferred, that the cutis is not solitary in its power of combining with tannin and forming leather; on the contrary, that the fibrin of the blood, in the form of a fibrinous concretion, or the burly coat; and that the fibrous and serous textures, and the vessels, including each kind, pos- sess this power in a still more eminent degree,â€” and that the mucous membranes possess it in an equal degree ; and may not the same conclusion be extended to muscular fibre ? Relative to the liver, spleen, pancreas, and kidney, their power of com- bining with tannin is problematical. That a portion of each of these viscera does combine with it and the colouring matter of catechu, is pretty certain, and most likely it is the connecting cellular struc- ture which enters so largely into the composition of their substance. I am disposed to think that this remark does not apply to medullary matter; it seems in a certain manner to be preserved by tannin, without entering into distinct combination with it. After having obtained the preceding results, the this is a principal cause that the leather is so well fitted for the cli- mate in which it is made. Made in a hot climate, it is soft and very porous, allowing heat and perspiration to escape; made in a cold and temperate climate it is strong and dense, excluding moisture and retaining heat.

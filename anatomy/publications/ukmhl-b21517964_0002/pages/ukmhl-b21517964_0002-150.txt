138 EXPERIMENTS ON THE BLOOD * Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal, vol. xxxv. p. 94. an absorption in one instance of about *3 cubic inch, and in the other of about -4 cubic inch; and, with venous blood, in the instance of common air, of about 1* cubic inch, and in that of oxygen, of about 1*25 cubic inch. These experiments were all made on the blood of the same animal. In experiments on the blood of different individuals of the same species of animal, and on the blood of animals of different species, the results have varied in regard to the degree of absorp- tion, and remarkably so in the instance of the blood of man. In every instance the absorption or disappearance of a portion of the air has been attended with some change in the colour of the blood ; the venous has invariably acquired the florid vermilion hue of arte- rial blood, and the arterial has had its florid hue heightened. The air that has been absorbed or which disap- pears, when atmospheric air has been used, in ac- cordance with the commonly received opinion and the results of Dr. Christison's experiments,* has been found to be oxygen. Relative to the residual air, when pure oxygen has been used, whether on the smaller or larger scale of experiment, no carbonic acid gas has been detected in it in the most carefully conducted trials. When common air has been employed, then a trace of this acid gas has been found in the residual air

44 EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS a general fact, and be announced as a rule or principle. Relative to the second point,—whether the pro- portion of fibrin is augmented in sizy blood, as is the opinion of the same author,* the results of the trials, detailed in the last table, favour rather the conclusion, that there is no constant relation between the appearance of the burly coat of the blood and the proportion of fibrin which the blood contains. Sir Charles Scudamore, in the experiments from which he draws the conclusion, that sizy blood contains a much larger proportion of fibrin than healthy blood, estimated the proportion of fibrin not for the blood as a whole, but for the crassamentum. Now, as sizy blood commonly affords a contracted crassamentum in which the fibrin is comparatively condensed, and in which the residual proportion of serum is comparatively small, — it follows that a definite quantity of sizy crassamentum must contain more fibrin, than the same quantity of healthy crassamentum, and yet the healthy blood may con- tain more fibrin than the sizy blood. In the fifth example in the last Table, the serum, was decanted from the crassamentum in the two successive instances of V. S., and the red particles were expressed from it: the following were the results,—estimated per cent.f * Op. cit. p. 119, et passim. t The colouring matter mixed with the serum of the clot was obtained by breaking up the clot in a moist linen bag, and subject-

ON THE BLOOD. 5 The following experiment was made at the same time: it differed principally from the preceding in two circumstances, viz. in the vial being left open, and in the bulb of the thermometer being near the surface of the fluid. Experiment 2. Temperature of blood when drawn - 103° After 1 minute - 103° 2 3^ 4 minutes 103° 5 6 j> coagulation commencing - 103c 12 17 102-75 102-5 102° 99° 96-5 At first view, the temporary pause in the cooling of the blood in these two experiments just after the commencement of coagulation, would seem to in- dicate an evolution of heat, commensurate with the arrested cooling effect: but, as the result may be owing to other causes, this conclusion, however spe- cious, may be erroneous. It appeared to me there- fore advisable, to repeat the above experiments on cooling, as accurately as possible, substituting water for the blood. I thus reasoned; if the results in regard to the rate of cooling of the blood and water should be similar, the thermometer being stationary for

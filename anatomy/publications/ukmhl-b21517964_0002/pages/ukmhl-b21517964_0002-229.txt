217 IN THE URINE OF MAN. as nearly alike as possible,—having been received as the bladder was emptied into four vials, just emptied of distilled water, and placed immediately to cool side by side in the open air, at a temperature of about 50°. In about half an hour, they had fallen to about 54°. Then they were in succession placed under the receiver, and the exhaustion effected. No. 1, boiled up very much. No. 2, remained per- fectly tranquil. No. 3, gave off a very few parti- cles of air. No. 4, remained perfectly tranquil. In these instances, I did not test No. 1, and 3, by potash,—the other results seeming to demonstrate that the air disengaged was adventitious, and de- rived from the atmosphere. The experiments which I have made have been numerous,—on the urine of the same individual at different hours for many days consecutively, and also at intervals at different seasons of the year;—and further on the urine of different individuals under various circumstances. The general result has been as I have stated, negative, and the more uniformly and perfectly so, the more accuracy has been ob- served in manipulating,—the greater the precautions taken to prevent the admission of atmospheric air. From what I have witnessed generally in con- ducting the inquiry, I am strongly impressed with the conviction, that in a state of health, no free carbonic acid passes from the blood through the kidneys, or is conveyed dissolved in their secretion, and consequently that these organs do not perform

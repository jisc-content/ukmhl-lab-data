The dura mater became corrugated and ap- peared to be much contracted; from shining silky white, its natural colour, it became dull white, with a yellowish tint. 7. The pericardium became shrivelled and ap- peared to be contracted ; its inner surface exhibited corrugation, and seemed distinctly fibrous: there was no appearance indicative of its having a serous membrane. 8. The skin, contracted very much ; the surface of the cutis vera became rough, as if glandular; the cu- ticle was rendered weak, almost pulverulent, scarcely offering any resistance. 9. The transparent cornea became corrugated and apparently opaque. 10. Stomach and intestines; their lining mem- brane was very much contracted and corrugated, and so altered in appearance, as not to be distinguisha- ble ; it was rendered also very weak, so as to be easily rubbed off.

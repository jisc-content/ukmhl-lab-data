129 ON THE BLOOD. formed according to the appearances and qualities of the blood) in which the blood, as far as we have learned from experience, is not apparently altered, as in the continued fever of summer, especially in the south of Europe, differing but little from the ephemera,—as in the early stage of synochus,—as in apoplexy, and tetanus, and many of the diseases strictly belonging to the neuroses, in the treatment of which blood-letting is often useful and sometimes indispensable,—and as in aneurism. These consi- derations tend to support the former conclusion. It appears to me, that the more experience medical practitioners have, the less confidence they place in the appearances of the blood, in forming their opinion on the nature of a disease and on the mode of treating it. What were the sentiments of the late learned and experienced Dr. Heberden on this matter ? He says, " the more we know of the human body, the more reason we find to believe, that the seat of diseases is not to be sought for in the blood, to the sensible qualities of which, they seem to have very little relation; and though it be supposed to hold in all maladies, yet in reality, it is but in very few, that the blood affords the prac- titioner any useful information." This is called by Sir Charles Scudamore, in his Essay on the Blood, a remarkable passage. In the state of knowledge of the blood, at the time it was written, there can be no doubt, that the practical conclusion with which it ends was perfectly correct; and I fear it is VOL. II. K

ON THE QUESTION, ETC. 215 ance of the froth which rises in boiling urine, and from the precipitate procured by adding lime to the fluid. His statement on the subject is very brief;â€” the following is the whole of it. " Au moment ou elles (nos urines) commencent a bouillir, on les voit se couvrir d'une ecume blanche volumineuse qui en est gonflee, comme je m'en suis assure, en re- cueillant une certaine quantit6 dans une cloche. Si, en outre, on y jette de la chaux en poudre, la plus grande partie se change en carbonate." The experiments which I have instituted myself on this subject, have afforded results which are not reconcileable either with those of M. Proust, or of Mr. Brande. On the first it appears to me unnecessary to offer any remarks, as the methods employed are of very doubtful accuracy. In some carefully conducted trials, in which lime-water was added to fresh urine in close vessels, I could detect no carbonate of lime in the precipitate recently examined and not col- lected on a filtre. If, however, many hours were allowed to elapse, then carbonic acid was extricated from the precipitate on the addition of dilute mu- riatic acid. On the effects of the air-pump on the urine, which may be considered an unobjectionable test of the presence of a free gas, or simply absorbed as the carbonic acid in this fluid has been supposed to be, I have made very many experiments, both in Corfu in 1828, and during the last twelve months in this

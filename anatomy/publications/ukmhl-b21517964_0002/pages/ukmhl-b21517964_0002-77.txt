OBSERVATIONS ON THE BLOOD. G5 losing this peculiar property by which its particles are attracted together."* To ascertain, if a brisk motion really prevents the coagulation of the blood, as is asserted by Dr. Bostock, I made the following experiment, pre- ferring it to the means mentioned by him, as we know that by moderately stirring the blood, its fibrin merely is separated, and not its property of coagulating destroyed. About two ounces of blood were received into a large vial and immediately shaken violently, and the agitation was continued without intermission for ten minutes, which was two minutes after the blood at rest coagulated. The result was, that the blood thus shaken, acquired a scarlet hue from being mixed with, and from the action of air, and appeared to be liquid. But this was merely in appearance; for when poured on a filter, it separated into two parts,—one, the serum, containing, suspended in it, the red particles, which passed through the filter:—the other, the fibrin in ;i finely divided state, coloured by adhering red parti- cles which remained on the filter. This effect of agitation may be imitated by breaking up the crassa- * Lower supposed that agitation had this effect on blood, and in his time, (now at least 170 years ago) the opinion appears to have been current: thus, when on the subject of transfusion, and consi- dering the best state of blood for the purpose, he gives the pre- ference to that flowing from a living animal, because, he remarks,— the blood which has been collected in a vessel, (utcunque satis prai- caveri posset, crebra agitatione, ne congeletur) is necessarily in some respects changed.—De Corde, p. 173.

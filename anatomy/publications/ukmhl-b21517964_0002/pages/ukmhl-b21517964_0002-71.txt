59 ON THE BLOOD. he would have made the same ingenious experiment in confirmation of them (I allude to the separation of the fibrin of the blood of the frog from its red particles, by filtration in its liquid state), had he been aware, that these particles, on account of their large size, could be detained on a filter. As Dr. William Hunter was senior to Hewson, and as the latter was associated with him, it may be a question, whether the merit of the discovery of coagulable lymph, is not due to him. In his controversy with the late Dr. Monro, pub- lished in 1777, under the title of " Medical Commen- taries," he gives a quotation from his Lectures, de- livered in 1759-60, from which it appears, that then he had a clear apprehension of the part performed in the blood by coagulable lymph. I shall transcribe the passage, as it is on many accounts interesting. Accounting for the red blood not transuding through the vessels, he refers it principally to the glutinous quality of the blood, when " equally mixed up with its coagulating part." " That part," he adds, "co- agulates as certainly as the blood stagnates, even in living bodies ; and when the universal stagnation happens in death, this part of the blood collects itself into irregular polypi and coagulations all over the body, and the rest of the blood is no longer the thick viscid fluid it was before, but rather a bloody serum that will ooze through all the vessels and mem- branes." Now as Hewson, at this time was only about 20

IN CONNEXION WITH RESPIRATION. 153 important properties of the fluid are, I believe, in harmony with it. The sesquicarbonate, I may add, seems to be the state of rest of the alkali in combination with car- bonic acid, under ordinary circumstances of exposure to the atmosphere. Thus the native compound is the sesquicarbonate, as is also, I believe, the efflo- resced salt * And I find that although a solution of the bicarbonate may be brought by the air-pump to the state of sesquicarbonate, it cannot be reduced to that of the carbonate ; after it has ceased to give off any air in vacuo, it effervesces with the supertartrate of potash ; and if evaporated to dryness over sul- phuric acid under an exhausted receiver, on being subjected to heat, it disengages carbonic acid gas. 4.—Does the Blood contain any Gas capable of being extricated by the Air-Pump ? On this subject also there has been much dif- ference of opinion. Our distinguished countryman Mayow, more than a century ago, stated that blood, especially arterial blood, effervesces in vacuo, which he attributed to the disengagement of air, his Spiri- tus Nitro-aerius.f Sir Everard Home, on the * On exposing carbonate of soda in excess to carbonic acid gas over mercury, the gas is rapidly absorbed with the expulsion of part of the water of crystallization, so as to produce an appearance of deliquescence, and the sesquicarbonate is formed. t Johannis Mayow, Opera omnia.

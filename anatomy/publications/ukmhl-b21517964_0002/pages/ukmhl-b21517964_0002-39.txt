ON THE BLOOD. 27 individual, and perhaps its strength and energies) —that the specific gravity of the blood of the mam- malia is next,—next that of reptiles,—then that of fishes,—and lastly, that of the different classes of animals having colourless blood, amongst which it is probable, grounded on the preceding considerations, that the blood of insects will hold the highest place. Many things already known favour this view of the subject: but still it must be considered hypo- thetical, until it has been fairly investigated ex- perimentally. 6.— Observations on the specific gravity of the blood of animals blooded to death. To endeavour to determine whether, in the in- stance of animals blooded to death, any difference exists in the specific gravity of the blood which flows first, and that which flows last,—I made a few experiments in Edinburgh in the summer of 1812, the results of which are contained in the following Table.

MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS 68 of a soldier labouring under a slight ailment, and on whom no well-marked effect connected with loss of blood was perceptible during the operation. They were placed close to each other, and carefully ob- served. The blood in each did not coagulate, as might have been expected, in the order in which it was received, but irregularly. Thus the first re- ceived was the last but one to coagulate, and thnl which was received in the crucible, which was the fourth in succession, coagulated first. When one reflects on the subject, the inference appears to me to be obviously what I have suggested above, viz. that no two drops of blood are precisely similar in their composition and properties. It is evident on reflection that the fluid of a continuous stream of blood must be derived from different parts of the body. In one portion there may be an unusual or less than usual quantity derived from the vessels of the muscles, or brain, or liver, or spleen, &c.; and we cannot but suppose, that the blood from the kidney, after urine has been secreted from it, is different from the blood from the liver or pancreas, after supplying bile and the pancreatic fluid. The preceding experiments and this reasoning are con- firmed by another fact which I have observed; viz. that if the crassamentum, the instant it is formed, is removed, it will be succeeded by another coagulum; and if this is removed, by another,—and so on re- peatedly till all the fibrin has coagulated,—clearly demonstrating, that, in any given quantity of blood,

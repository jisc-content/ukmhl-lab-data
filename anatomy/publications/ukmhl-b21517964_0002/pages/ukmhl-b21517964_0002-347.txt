AIR ON DEAD ANIMAL MATTER. 335 The blood subjected to experiment was venous blood. It was placed in a receiver over mercury in a measured quantity of common air, a few minutes after it had been drawn, having been quickly cooled by immersion in water. During the first twelve hours, the volume of air over it was not sensibly changed. Soon after there was a diminution of the bulk of the air, and this diminution gradually in- creased. When greatest, it was nearly equal to the volume of the blood. This was accompanied by a change of form of the crassamentum ; it, as it were, dissolved away, and an apparently homogeneous fluid was formed. And next there was an augmen- tation of the bulk of the air. By examination at different times, I found, that the volume of air re- mained unchanged until putrefaction commenced ;* that carbonic acid was formed and absorbed by the blood; that the diminution of the volume of air continued till the blood was saturated with carbonic acid; and that its augmentation was owing to fur- ther evolution of this gas, connected with the for- mation of ammonia and the progressive changes of the putrefactive decomposition.f * This may appear contrary to what has been already stated rela- tive to the absorption of oxygen by blood previous to putrefaction : but is not in reality; without agitation, the putrefaction of blood, I believe, commences [at least at a high temperature,] before the ab- sorption of air by it, is demonstrable. t The products of the putrefactive decomposition are, I believe, very much modified by temperature; so that were the results ob- tained in summer and winter compared, they would be found greatly

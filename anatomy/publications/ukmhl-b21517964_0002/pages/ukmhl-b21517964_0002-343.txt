331 XV. ON THE AGENCY OF ATMOSPHERIC AIR ON DEAD ANIMAL MATTER; AND ON THE PUTREFACTIVE PROCESS. Amongst many questions of interest involved in the subjects enumerated above, there are two which stand forward in a prominent manner; viz., whether dead animal matter before putrefaction commences has the power of absorbing air; and whether the putrefactive change, is attended with elevation of temperature. Bearing on these points, although not exclusively so, I shall relate three sets of ex- periments which I have made: one, on the agitation of fresh animal matter in atmospheric air; another, on its exposure to this mixed air, confined without agitation; and a third, on exposure to the atmo- sphere, under circumstances favourable to putrefac- tion : and, I shall conclude with some general re- marks on the putrefactive process. JVIy attention was first specially directed to the inquiry in Malta, in 1829- Of the results then ob- tained and published in the Edinburgh Medical and

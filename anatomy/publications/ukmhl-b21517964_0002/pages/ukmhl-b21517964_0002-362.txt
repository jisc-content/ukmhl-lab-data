ON THE AGENCY OF ATMOSPHERIC 350 matter was formed, by which the parts were hid. It was washed oft", and the different textures were found nearly equally changed ; their cohesion irregularly diminished; the fine connecting tissue, or most de- licate fibre, dissolved entirely or in part; holes formed in the two first-mentioned textures, and the coarser fibres, or fasciculi of fibres, separated in the last. On the 1st September they were all reduced to an ammoniacal poultaceous state, in which only a few minute tendinous fibres were distinguishable. Aorta.—A portion of this vessel, belonging to body No. 1, placed for observation, was 1° higher than the water on the 30th July. It had a peculiar and ammoniacal odour, and its surface was becom- ing unctuous, especially its compact fibrous sheath, or the third coat from the inner one. On the 11th August there was an elevation of 3°; a good deal of light-brown poultaceous matter had formed; the odour was strongly ammoniacal, and many larva? were feeding. On the 16th August, it was entirely converted into a semifluid opaque mass, of a light- brown colour, and strong ammoniacal odour, and its temperature was the same as that of the water. I have also made trial of the different coats of the aorta, placed apart for observation, viz.,—the loose outer cellular, containing some fatty matter,—the adjoining compact cellular, or rather fibrous,—the next commonly called the middle coat, and the inner coat,—taken from body No. 5. The changes in all of them proceeded much in the same manner as has been

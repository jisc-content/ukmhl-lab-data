166 EXPERIMENTS ON THE BLOOD circumstance, that in comparative experiments with and without addition of a portion of solution of caustic alkali, there was no difference in the pro- portion of nitrous gas absorbed: and it was corro- borated by another circumstance, viz., that after the absorption of the nitrous gas, the blood was capable of absorbing seventy per cent, of carbonic acid gas;* and farther by the result that when nitrous gas is added not to saturation, the whole of it is absorbed.f As regards the blood itself, the colour of both venous and arterial was altered ; both were rendered darker and browner, as if a minute quantity of nitric acid had been added to them, a change long known to be occasioned by nitrous gas. In the degree of change there was however a difference; in the in- stance of arterial and of oxygenated arterial blood, it was more strongly marked than in that of the venous. In conjunction with the unsuccessful attempts with the other gases already mentioned, do not the results * To some venous blood of a sheep which absorbed 182 per cent, of carbonic acid gas, so much of a solution of pure hydrate of potash was added, that it absorbed 218 per cent, of the acid gas; seventeen measures of this blood with excess of alkali, agitated with fifty-one of nitrous gas, absorbed 5*5 measures; sixteen of the blood without the excess of alkali absorbed five measures : thirty-four measures of carbonic acid gas were added to the latter, the excess of nitrous gas being left in the tube; on agitation twelve measures of the carbonic acid were absorbed. t In one experiment eighty-four measures of the venous blood of the sheep were agitated with ten of nitrous gas over mercury; the whole of the gas was absorbed: twelve of oxygen were added; on agitation again there was no further absorption.

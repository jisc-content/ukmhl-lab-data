152 EXPERIMENTS ON THE BLOOD it is considered that this fluid may be exposed to a temperature of 212Â° without disengaging carbonic acid, of which I have had proof in several trials. Sulphuretted hydrogen does not expel carbonic acid from the alkalies in solution in water. Bicar- bonate of soda dissolved to saturation in distilled water absorbs, I find, 143 per cent, of its volume of this gas ; whilst the serum of blood (it was sheep's that was tried) dissolved 207 per cent., arterial blood 235, and venous 290. This, too, is unfavourable to the same idea ; as is also the large proportion of carbonic acid which blood, it lias been shown, is capable of absorbing. Supertartrate of potash occasions an effervescence, when mixed in substance with a solution of the ses- quicarbonate, but not of the carbonate of soda ; and the effect is similar, whether the mixture be made over mercury, air excluded, or in an open vessel exposed to the atmosphere. The supertartrate of potash also, I find, mixed with blood and agitated with common air, acts as with the sesquicarbonate, and occasions a disengagement of air, and both from arterial and venous blood, and from serum; and the air I have ascertained is carbonic acid. From these facts, may it not be inferred that the alkali in the blood, in its normal or healthiest con- dition, is neither in the state of carbonate nor of bicarbonate, but of sesquicarbonate ? The power of the blood to absorb carbonic acid and sulphuretted hydrogen accords best with this view, and some other

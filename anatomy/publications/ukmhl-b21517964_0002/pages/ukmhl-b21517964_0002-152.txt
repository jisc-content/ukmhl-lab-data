140 EXPERIMENTS ON THE BLOOD compare them with those alluded to formerly ob- tained, I am not a little surprised at their discre- pancy ; and I can only account for it by supposing that it may have been owing in part to the difference of season when the two sets of experiments were conducted. The first were made in Malta, in 1829> in the hot months of July and August, when the thermometer in the open air was generally above 80° and occasionally above 90°. The last have been made in England, and principally in January of the year 1838, when the temperature of atmosphere was occasionally low, the greater part of the time below the freezing point, and often so low as 20°. From what I have witnessed, I am induced to infer, that the higher the atmospheric temperature is, and the less necessity there is for the production of animal heat, the less difference there is between venous and arterial blood, and the less power the former has of combining with oxygen, and of forming or evolving carbonic acid. In Malta I carefully compared the blood of the jugular vein and carotid artery of a sheep during the season mentioned ; when coagulated and still hot, there was no perceptible difference in their colour ; in each it was less florid than the arterial blood of the same animal in England in winter, and less dark than the venous : its hue was as it were a mixture of the two. And in this observation I could not be mistaken ; the circumstances under which it was made precluded mistake ; vessels of the same size were used ; similar quantities of blood were

EXPERIMENTS ON THE BLOOD 148 possible, another cubic inch of serum, containing the same quantity of carbonic acid. Now poured back into the bottle and agitated, on opening the stop-cock a little air was disengaged; it was col- lected and found equal to Tfoths cubic inch. The serum was left exposed to the action of the air in the bottle over night, the stop-cocks closed; the following morning on opening the stop-cock of the bent tube no air was expelled; on the contrary, there was a just perceptible rise of water in it. The experiment was carried further: the serum was transferred to a vial and closed, and the double- mouthed bottle was filled with hydrogen. The serum was returned and well agitated with the hy- drogen. On turning the stop-cock TVoths of a cubic inch of air was expelled. It was agitated a second time without further expulsion of air, and left in contact with hydrogen for more than twelve hours without any further effect. Thus it appears that of the two cubic inches of carbonic acid gas introduced into the serum, only one-fifth of a cubic inch was expelled by successive agitation with atmospheric air and with hydrogen. One cubic inch of venous blood of a man which had absorbed 1*2 cubic inch of carbonic acid, was mixed with twelve cubic inches of similar blood, and agitated with hydrogen in the double-mouthed bottle. A very little air only was expelled, viz. Truths cubic inch. To fifty-five measures (M cubic inch) of venous

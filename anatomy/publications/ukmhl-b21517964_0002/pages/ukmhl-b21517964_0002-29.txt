17 ON THE BLOOD, quired; beyond my reach; and which I fear, in the present state of our knowledge, is hardly practicable. From the results of the experiments which I have had an opportunity of making on healthy serum, and which will be individually given hereafter, I may state that I have found it to vary between 1020, and 1031. The trials which I have made of the specific gravity of coagulable lymph or fibrin have been comparatively few in number. I can find mention of three only in my note-books. In the 1st, it was found of specific gravity 1046; in the 2nd of 1057 ; and in the 3rd, 1060. The first was pro- cured from blood not buffed; was separated by washing with water, and the fibrin or lymph thus obtained, was weighed after having been gently pressed between folds of blotting paper. The second, was a fibrinous concretion from the heart, free from colouring matter; it was weighed without having being subjected to the action of water, after having been gently pressed in blotting paper. The third was a portion of buffy coat; it was weighed after having been well washed with water, and the excess of moisture removed, as in the two preceding instances, by paper. My experiments on the specific gravity of the red particles have also been few in number. From those on the results of which I think most reliance can be placed, it would appear, that the specific gravity of a red particle is about 1132, which VOL. II. c

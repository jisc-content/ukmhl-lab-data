218 ON THE QUESTION OF FREE CARBONIC ACID a part in the economy similar to that of the lungs, in separating this acid gas from the blood in cir- culation. M. Proust in remarking on the results which he obtained, those already referred to,—seeming to him to shew that carbonic acid gas abounds in the urine, says, " we ought not to be surprised at it, as this gas is eliminated from the system in various other ways." " Cet acide, considere comme ejec- tion ne faut pas nous surprendre. Nous en per- dons par la transpiration par Pexhalation pulmonaire, et il fait partie des gaz que la digestion rejette par d'autres voies." This, fairly considered, does not strengthen his conclusion; but is perfectly consistent with the op- posite one,—that the kidneys do not belong to its regular channel of outlet. If carbonic acid is capable of passing through the kidneys in the state under consideration, it appeared to me probable that it might be detected in the urine after drinking largely of a fluid abounding in it. I have made two trials with a view to determine this. At Corfu the agreeable effervescing mineral water of Cilli in Styria, which contains an enormous quantity of carbonic acid, and some carbonate of lime, was drunk fasting, a pint at a draught; and recently in this country about the same quantity of soda water in the act of effervescing was used. The bladder had been previously emptied. The urine on both occasions, collected within an hour after, was found

THEORY OF MEMBRANES. 419 eased and the pulmonary artery so rarely, their structure being similar ? Why is the upper part of the duodenum so rarely the seat of ulceration, and the lower part of the ileum so frequently, and still more frequently the vermiform process of the cce- cum, all three being glandular, but the duodenum in the most marked degree ? Why in tubercular phthisis are ulcers so frequently found in the larynx, and so unfrequently in the trachea ? Why is the urethra so little liable to ulcerate ? Why are the ureters almost exempt from ulceration ? 2dly, On the structure of membranes, viewed as elements,—simple and uniform,—well marked by their appearances and properties, — perfectly dis- tinct from each other, and incapable of being con- founded ;—in colour, thickness, hardness, density, resistance, &c. nowise similar;—subjected to desicca- tion, putrefaction, maceration, coction, &c. offering different results,—in brief, according to Bichat's idea, each as well characterised as is a simple sub- stance, or chemical element: on this subject it ap- pears to me there is much want of satisfactory proof, and the weight of evidence is against the conclusion. How little analogous for instance is the lining mem- brane of the ureters and of the small intestines ; of the gall bladder, and of the urinary bladder; of the frontal sinuses, and the other adjoining sinuses, and of the stomach and duodenum; of the stomach and duodenum, and of the larynx and trachea. Some of these in structure, appearance, firmness, the e e 2

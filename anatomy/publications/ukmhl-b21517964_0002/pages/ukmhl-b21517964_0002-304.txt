ACTION OF LIME ON THE 292 mouthed bottle, well corked, and covered with cerate cloth, to exclude the ingress of atmospheric air, and so preserve the lime in its caustic state. One of the first experiments tried was commenced on the 27th August. A portion of muscle, rectum, verge of anus, urinary bladder, prostrate gland, vesi- culae seminalis, a portion of jejenum, the gall-bladder, and the gall-ducts, were immersed as mentioned above. They were taken from a subject in a state of incipient putrefaction, and they exhaled a fetid smell. On immersion in the lime and water, as might be expected, they gave off a strong ammoniacal odour. They were first examined on the 24th of September. They were then all in excellent pre- servation ; swollen, but not corroded, nor their deli- cate tissue injured. They were next examined seven months after, viz., on the 5th of May of the year following. The report was equally favourable; it is stated that they were much in the same state as before,—the texture of each part distinct,—and the part, as a whole, easily distinguishable. They were left undisturbed nearly two years,—until the 6th April, 1832, when, on examination, they were found to have undergone material change. The cuticle had become soft and transparent, as had also the dura mater, admitting of being torn with the greatest ease. The muscle appeared to be con- verted into adipocire, which was quite white,—had no unpleasant smell,—was friable when dried, and

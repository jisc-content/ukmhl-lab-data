AFTER DEATH. 213 pathological influence must necessarily be involved in some degree of doubt. I was led to institute these trials, in search of pus in the blood, from some observations made by Mr. Gulliver, who, I believe, was the first to detect this substance, or its similitude, in the circulation.* * The observations I refer to, are contained in a very original and ingenious paper by this gentleman, which was read before the Royal Society last spring, and which has since been published under the title of " Researches on Suppuration," in the Philosophical Maga- zine, for September, 1838. This discovery (supposing that the particles are true pus-globules) which I attribute to him, of course rests on precise microscopical observation, and is not to be confounded with the imagined detection of pus in the veins, and its inferred existence in the blood, in in- stances designated phlebitis, the majority of which, hitherto described, I am disposed to believe, were examples not of true inflammation of vein, but merely of obstruction from the formation of a fibrinous coagulum, with a tendency to soften and assume a puriloid character.

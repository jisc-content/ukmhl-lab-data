EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS 30 by adding water to the blood before coagulation, the volume of the coaguhim is increased, and the separation of fluid from it is diminished: therefore the inference from the quantity of serum, inde- pendent of its specific gravity, is of no weight in this question. 7.â€” Observations on the specific gravity of human blood and serum in instances of disease. The following observations were made at three different periods, viz. in the years 1811-12, in Edin- burgh ; in 1818-19, at Kandy in the Island of Ceylon, and in 1826-27, in Corfu. As both the climate and the circumstances affecting the condi- tion of the individuals were very different, I shall give the results obtained at each period, in a table apart. In these instances the same precautions were taken in ascertaining the specific gravity of the blood as in the former: and, I may add, that the blood from which the serum was collected for trial, was kept so as to prevent evaporation, either in a bottle and corked, or defended by a cover if in a bleeding-cup. The necessity of this to insure accuracy is obvious: if the air have free access to the surface of the blood, a portion of the aqueous part will necessarily be carried off by evaporation,

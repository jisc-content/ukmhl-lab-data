404 ON MACERATION IN WATER OF necting the peritoneal coat and the muscular, and the peritoneal coat itself, were much in the same state. On the seventy-second day, very little re- mained ; the small residue not lost in changing the water was in the form of a debris, resembling that of a cellular, serous, or fibrous membrane; and I allude to the three, not knowing well how to dis- tinguish the debris of the one from the other. The ureters, it may be remarked, resisted disintegration considerably longer. During the whole period of change, they very much resembled the biliary ducts, and gradually wasted like fibrous tissue. Whilst the maceration was in progress, I sought in vain for a membrane deserving the name of epithelium in the bladder and ureters; and I was as unsuccessful in my seareh for villi on their lining membrane. I sought also for mucous glands or follicles, but could not detect them in a satisfactory manner in the bladder, excepting a few close to its orifice, in the small triangular space. In some instances they ap- peared indistinctly in the ureters, in others not. I must confess, I have doubts if the lining membrane of the bladder deserves the name of a mucous mem- brane. In the dead body, I have never found mu- cus adhering to it; and it is easy to conceive that the mucus which is contained in the urine may be derived from the glandules, or follicles above alluded to, and from those of the urethra. I express these doubts with hesitation; and chiefly because it ap- pears wrong to take for granted that which is not

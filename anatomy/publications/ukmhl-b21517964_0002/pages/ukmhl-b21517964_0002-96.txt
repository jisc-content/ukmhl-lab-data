84 MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS conveying only a similar fluid, is a subject for in- quiry. In the brain, in an instance of jaundice, I have witnessed, on making sections of the organ, points distinct from the ordinary blood-specks, tinged by bile, otherwise colourless, and which, were it not for the adventitious hue, would have been im- perceptible. I regret I had not an opportunity of examining the fluid of these puncta with the micro- scope.* The most probable inference seems to me to be, that they were either divided lymphatics, or vessels of the order just alluded to. But, even sup- posing that no such vessels exist, the lymphatics, under different influences, may pour more or less of their contents into the general circulation, and so affect the quality of the blood. The quality of blood abstracted by the leech perhaps may be adduced in support of the argument. It is commonly believed, that the blood so ab- stracted, does not. differ from that procured by the use of the lancet. According to my observations, it abounds much more in red particles, and very much less in serum and lymph; and in consequence, its character is different, â€” coagulating much less firmly, or often not at all, exhibiting merely a gru- mous appearance, of unusually high specific gravity, and when evaporated to dryness affording a larger * Since the above was written, another similar opportunity has occurred ; the yellow fluid of the puncta, under the microscope was found to contain a very few blood-particles : it was probably, there- fore, extremely dilute blood.

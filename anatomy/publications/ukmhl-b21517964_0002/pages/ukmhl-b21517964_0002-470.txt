458 ON THE MALE ORGANS found in them some spermatic animalcules, which may be considered equivalent to spermatic fluid. The result of a chemical examination of one speci- men of the fluid which was contained in them,—in the instance of the common ray, amounting nearly to a cubic inch, was favourable to its urinary cha- racter; for besides affording a little saline matter, principally common salt, it yielded a little animal matter very analogous to urea, soluble in alcohol, uniting with nitric acid, and the compound crys- tallizable and soluble. The nature of the anal appendages and their functions have, from the earliest times of natural history, been more or less a subject of controversy. Aristotle considered them as characteristic of and peculiar to the male cartilaginous fishes. Lorenzini erroneously denied that they were distinctive marks of the sexes. Willoughby, Ray, Artedi, and Broussonet considered them as organs of intromission, as penes. Rondelet opposed this notion, and con- sidered them as holders, in which opinion he was fol- lowed by Bloch, who I believe was the first to de- scribe them with tolerable accuracy and minuteness.* Recently, some naturalists appear to have adopted one conclusion, some the other ; the majority favour the idea of Bloch,—that they are analogous, as he ingeniously endeavoured to prove, to arms, or rather feet, intended for seizure and holding fast.

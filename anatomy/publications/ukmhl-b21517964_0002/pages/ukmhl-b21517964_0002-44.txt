32 EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS The blood in each instance was venous, and was taken from the arm. The individuals from whom it was abstracted, were patients in the Royal In- firmary, and belonged chiefly to the working class, and were, with few exceptions, inhabitants of the town. The results are too limited in number to admit of any general conclusions being deduced from them in a clear and satisfactory manner. The following inferences, however, they seem to warrant, as pro- bable ;—viz. that in inflammatory complaints the proportion of animal matter is increased, the pro- portion of water diminished; and also that the density of the female blood is less than that of man. The former inference accords with the ex- periments of Robinson, Tabor, and Langrish, which although imperfect in themselves, may at least per- haps be depended on for comparison. In the ma- jority of the examples adduced, nothing unusual was manifest in the appearance of the blood. Whenever the blood exhibited a buffy coat, the inferior surface of the mass of crassamentum ap- peared softer than usual, as if from a deficiency of fibrin ; which is not surprising, considering that the specific gravity of the red particles is greater than that of the fibrin. The green colour of the serum of the chlorotic woman is worthy of remark;—its cause, I was not able to ascertain: it did not ap- pear to depend on the presence of bile. The blood of the man labouring under diabetes, was in each

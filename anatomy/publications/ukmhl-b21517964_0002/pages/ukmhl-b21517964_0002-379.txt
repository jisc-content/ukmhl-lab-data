AIR ON DEAD ANIMAL MATTER. 36? on the animal temperature is, no doubt, highly de- serving of inquiry and of experimental investigation. Were I to draw an inference further from the ob- servations which I have made on the temperature of different parts of the body, I should be disposed to say, that besides the prima? via?, there is no other apparent auxiliary source of heat, (considering the lungs as the main source)—neither the brain, the temperature of which is comparatively low, nor the kidneys, the fluid secreted by which appears in the bladder to be of rather lower temperature than the blood in the heart and great vessels; nor the liver, the temperature of which I have never seen above that degree which might be expected, taking into account its proximity to the lungs, its bulk and the abundant manner in which it is supplied with blood. In a former part of this work " on the tempera- ture of the human body after death," two instances are given of an extraordinary high degree of tem- perature observed in bodies which had been dead a short time; and in both of which the fibrin of the blood had disappeared, as it does in putrefying, and yet the bodies exhibited none of the usual signs of the putrid change having even sensibly commenced. I then concluded in consequence, that the unusual temperature was not owing to putrefaction—or a post mortem effect; and, reflecting on all the cir- cumstances of these cases, and on the phenomena witnessed in my experiments on putrefaction, I am confirmed in that inference, and obliged to suppose

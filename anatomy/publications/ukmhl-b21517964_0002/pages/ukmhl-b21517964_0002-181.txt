IN CONNEXION WITH RESPIRATION. 169 tinuing the agitation it rose further to 46*5, very nearly to 47°. This experiment was made on the 12th of February, 1838, on the blood of the sheep. On the following day a similar experiment was made on the venous blood of man. The vial was filled with eleven cubic inches of this blood, its fibrin broken up in the usual manner, and with three cubic inches of mercury; the temperature of the blood and mercury was 42*5, and the temperature was the same after the introduction of three cubic inches of oxygen. The temperature of the room being 47°, a fire having shortly before been lit, the vial was taken to an adjoining passage where the temperature of the air was 39°. Here the vial was well agitated, held in the hand with thick gloves on as an additional protection. After about three quarters of a minute the thermometer in the vial had risen a degree, viz. to 43*5. On the 14th of the same month a third experi- ment was made on venous blood from the jugular vein of a sheep. The vial was filled with 3*5 cubic inches of mercury and eleven cubic inches of blood. The thermometer in the bottle, left five minutes, was stationary at 49°; the temperature of the mer- curial bath was 49°; the air of the room was 52°; a thermometer with its bulb moistened was 45°, which I mention because the outer covering of the vial was moistened with some blood which had over- flowed. After three cubic inches and a half of oxygen had been introduced, before agitation, the

120 MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS consequently in a manner confounding the dif- ference. I am tempted to give another form of argument, because connected with a curious fact. Against the vitality of the blood, it may be said, its characteristic properties may be preserved out of the body, under some circumstances most unfavour- able to life. Thus by the addition of a neutral salt, it may be kept liquid, and on dilution with water, after many days it will coagulate. It may be kept liquid too by a temperature of 32°, I know not how long; and on raising the temperature, it will coagu- late. Even freezing the blood, by reducing its tem- perature below 32° does not destroy its peculiar pro- perties. When exposed frozen to a gradually in- creasing temperature, it liquefies, and the liquid pre- sently coagulates. How, it may be asked, are these phenomena compatible with its being a living fluid ? Can it retain life when frozen ? If not, and yet become liquid and after that coagulate, its liquidity and coagulation are independent of life. To these arguments, again, it may be replied, it does not necessarily follow that a neutral salt, or a temperature of 32°, or the freezing of blood deprives it of vitality. Certain seeds will bear a very low tem- perature, much below the freezing point of water, and germinate afterwards. Some parts of warm-blooded injurious, often mortal.

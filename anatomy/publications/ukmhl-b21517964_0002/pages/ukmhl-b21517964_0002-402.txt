390 ON MACERATION IN WATER OF or conversion into a cribriform structure. After it had formed, further change was very slow, and in a manner very analogous to that of the thin skin, or of the dura mater and pericardium, and required even longer time for its completion. Between the two extremes of very thick and very thin cutis, there are parts intermediate in degree of thickness, and in- termediate also in relation to the follicles, &c. which they contain, as the skin of the inside of fore-arm, and that covering the shin-bone, that of the ear not including its lobe, &c.—and these parts observe also a kind of medium in their rapidity and manner of change. When examined in a certain stage of the process, they appear to consist of the same kind of tissue as the subcutaneous, only a little more con- densed ; and to the thickest skin, the same remark relative to texture is, I believe, justly applicable. Alimentary Canal, Mouth, and Fauces, (7-9- 10.)—Different parts of the lining membrane of the mouth and fauces underwent change with very dif- ferent degrees of rapidity. Where the ducts of nume- rous mucous glands pass through the membrane, and where the membrane is not extremely thin as in the roof of the mouth, it soon acquired a cribriform tex- ture like that noticed under the head of the cutis, and thus perforated, it underwent further change slowly. Where comparatively few mucous glands are situated in the subjacent tissue, and where the membrane is comparatively thick, as in the side of the mouth, and especially in the neighbourhood of the entrance

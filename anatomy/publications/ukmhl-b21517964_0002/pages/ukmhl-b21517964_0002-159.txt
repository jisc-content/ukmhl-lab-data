IN CONNEXION WITH RESPIRATION. 147 The effect of the absorption of the gas to per- fect saturation was on the arterial and venous blood the same; it rendered both very dark; the serum it rendered more liquid, which was well marked by diminished tendency to froth on agitation. I shall now proceed to notice the trials which I have instituted of agitating blood and serum, to which a known quantity of carbonic acid had been added, with one or more of the gases considered by Dr. Stevens as exerting an attraction on carbonic acid, and by that means expelling it. From the experiments which I have made on serum, it appears in its healthy state incapable of absorbing oxygen, or of immediately furnishing carbon to form carbonic acid; and in no instance in which I have agitated it with common air or with hydrogen, when obtained from the blood of a healthy animal, has there been any indication of the disengagement of gas; it therefore is peculiarly well fitted for the trial in question. To nine cubic inches of serum from the mixed blood of the sheep one cubic inch more of serum was added, containing a cubic inch of carbonic acid, with which it had been impregnated over mercury. The mixture of the two was introduced into the double-mouthed bottle without delay, and well agitated with twenty-two cubic inches of com- mon air. On turning the stop-cock there was no change of volume. The serum was transferred, and there was added to it, with as little motion as l 2

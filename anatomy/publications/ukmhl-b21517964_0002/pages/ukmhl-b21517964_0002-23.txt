ON THE BLOOD. 11 thermometer near the bottom of the vessel contain- ing the blood,—and when this fluid began to coagu- late towards the surface, he drew the instrument up. On the contrary, in all my latter experiments, viz., those on the blood of the shark and turtle, and many which were made on the blood of sheep at the Cape of Good Hope, the thermometer was not allowed to remain stationary,—it was gently moved from one part to another, so that the whole might be kept of the same temperature, till the coagulation commenced;—for when the blood is viscid and the vessel deep, the surface or the portion last drawn is warmer than that below,—and when shallow, the bottom is warmest, as I have frequently observed in my experiments. Further, in confirmation of the conclusion that no appreciable degree of heat is noticed during the coagulation of blood,—I may mention, analogically, the fact, that when the serum of the blood is coagu- lated, by means of dilute nitric acid, there is not the slightest elevation or change of temperature. The following are the particulars of an experiment in proof of this. An ounce of serum was added to an ounce of dilute nitric acid, each of the temperature of the air of the room, viz., 75°; coagulation was immediately produced, but not the slightest change of temperature was occasioned; the mixture was exactly 75°. The dilute nitric acid used contained five parts of water to one of strong acid. The serum employed was of specific gravity 1*030; and

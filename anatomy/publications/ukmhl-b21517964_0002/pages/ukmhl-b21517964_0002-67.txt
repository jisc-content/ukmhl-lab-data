55 ON THE BLOOD. cipally, almost exclusively, to its red particles, to which they attached vast importance, making their microscopical observations the foundation of various speculations and wide-reaching hypotheses.* At what time exactly the more precise ideas on the subject began to prevail,—those which are incul- cated in the writings of Hewson and the Hunters, and some of their able contemporaries, it is not easy to determine. The term "coagulable lymph" was then in common use, according to Hewson's definition of it; thus, Sir John Pringle, in the description of a fatal case, in which the heart was found to adhere to the pericardium, says, it was " in such a manner as parts adhere from recent inflammation, that is, by an exudation of coagulable lymph." f The probability, * Bocrhaave, opposing the hypothesis of Galen, that the blood is composed of four peculiar humours, remarks, " it appears clearly from the experiments of Leeuwenhoeck, that the red clot (the first of Galen's Elements) is composed merely of red particles united so as to form one mass; that the yellow bile (his second Element) is merely serum, and that its more dilute and pellucid parts (his third Element, in which the yellow bile was supposed to be dissolved) is to be considered as phlegm; and that the black parts of the crassa- mentum, its inferior portion (his black bile, and fourth Element) does not differ from the red, excepting in not being exposed to the air."—Praelect. Acad. L, 328. The elaborate medical doctrines which (his distinguished man built up, on the incorrect microscopical observations of Leeuwenhoeck, afford the most remarkable instance of what has been stated in the text; and should ever be a warning in refined and obscure inquiries, in which the microscope is brought into use. t Hewson, in his Treatise on the Lymphatic system, published in 1764, gives the case at page 114, transcribed from Sir John Pringle's notes.

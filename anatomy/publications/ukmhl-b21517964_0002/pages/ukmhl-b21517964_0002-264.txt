252 THE AGE OF MORBID ADHESIONS, ETC. Professor Burdach, when treating on what he con- siders "secretion after death," adduces the results of the experiments of Segalas, who, in the examina- tion of animals, found, that if it was delayed to twenty or thirty hours after the death of the animals, the blood was thicker in the right side of the heart, and diminished in quantity by the delay, and that sanguinolent serum had collected in the serous cava- ties, especially in the pleura.* These results, it appears to me, may be considered analogous to those described in the first experiment which I have related. As in that experiment the greater part of the fluid seems to have passed into the lungs through the natural channel of the pulmonary artery, â€” so in those of Segalas, the cruor might have had issue in the same way, and if putrefaction had commenced, as seems indicated by the coloured serum, an exudation might have taken place into the serous cavities, and especially from the lungs into the pleurae. porous, well adapted for use in a high temperature; in the latter, not having suffered from putrefaction, it is dense and almost impervi- ous. It is equally well fitted for use, as a protection from cold and moisture. * Op. cit. vol. viii. p. 509.

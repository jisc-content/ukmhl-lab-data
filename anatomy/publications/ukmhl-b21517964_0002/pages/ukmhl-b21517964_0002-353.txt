AI It ON DEAD ANIMAL MATTER. 341 3.— On the Exposure of Dead Animal Matter to the Atmosphere, under circumstances favourable to Putrefaction,—with a view to the question, Is th e Putrefaction of Animal Matter attended with an Elevation of Temperature f I shall give in some detail, the experiments which I have made to endeavour to determine this ques- tion. It may be premised, that they were all made at the same time and place as the preceding; that the subjects of them, as soon as possible, after they were taken from the body, were put into glass vessels, lightly covered with, and muffled in dry flax, for the purpose of diminishing the influence of the atmospheric air, as a cooling medium; and that a vessel holding water, was placed contiguously, for the sake of comparison in relation to temperature. I shall commence with the blood and its different ingredients or parts into which it may be separated out of the body; and from them proceed to the solid textures. Blood.—On the 19th August, about a pound and a half of venous blood, taken from a young man, labouring under a slight febrile ailment, moderately firmly coagulated, having been abstracted about three hours, was broken up, so that the colouring matter, the fibrin and serum were well mixed, and immediately put into a glass vessel in the manner premised for observation. On the 20th at noon, its temperature did not differ from that of the water

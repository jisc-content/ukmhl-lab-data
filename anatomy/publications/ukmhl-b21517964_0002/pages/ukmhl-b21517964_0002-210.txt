198 OBSERVATIONS ON THE BLOOD, ETC. between the latter and the examination of the blood, â€”circumstances without which little value can be attached to the record; and under the head of Re- marks, will be appended the organic lesions dis- covered, of most importance, characteristic of the disease, with occasional notices of lesions of rare occurrence. I may premise further, that in using, for the sake of brevity, the term "cruor," I have not employed it to designate merely a mixture of serum and red parti- cles, but a mixture of the two in which there may be some coagulable lymph, to be determined by trial. The terms "crassamentum" and "clot" I have used synonymously, in their ordinary acceptation, as ap- plied to the blood. The term, "fibrinous concretion," I have employed to designate masses of lymph or fibrin, in a coagulated state, such as used to be called polypi.

432 DUCTUS COMMUNIS CHOLEDOCHUS ; from the pressure of the abdominal muscles by the margin of the liver; and perhaps, the relative posi- tion of the common duct, having close to it on one side the hepatic artery, and beneath it the vena portse: and perhaps also, the somewhat spiral and lamellar structure of the cystic duct.* * The biliary ducts exhibit in different subjects, several varieties, —indeed they are rarely perfectly uniform, either in dimensions, or the manner in which they are connected, and especially the common duct with the pancreas. In illustration of some of the circumstances mentioned in the text, I shall give the results of a careful admea- surement of one ductus communis choledochus,—from a man, aged 30, who died of pulmonary consumption. Slit open, the greatest width of the tube, at the junction of the hepatic and cystic ducts, was of an inch, its least near its termination ; its length, measuring from the junction of the tubes, was just three inches; rather more than one- third of its length, viz. 1 ^ inch, was hid, enveloped in the pancreas and penetrating the coats of the intestine ; where it first joined the pancreas, its width was ; the length of the portion penetrating obliquely the intestine was ; and the longest valvular filament or process was In this duct, the valvular apparatus was strongly developed, and when the processes were distended (as they were by immersion in dilute sulphurous acid)—their points crossed ob- liquely, completely obstructing the passage. Glisson in his Anato- mia Hepatis, mentions, or rather infers the existence of, circular fibres, in the oblique part of the duct, to which he attributes in part the prevention of regurgitation, " regressu omnis in ductum commu- nem preepeditur a fibris annularibus, quae non modo orificium ipsum, sed et totum obliquum tractumobsident."t In the duct, just noticed, there was a distinct appearance of transverse fibres, but to a very limited extent, close to the mouth of the pancreatic duct; they had a silky lustre, not unlike the fibre of tendon or of the dura mater, and their use it may be conjectured, is to prevent undue extension of the part. t Anat.

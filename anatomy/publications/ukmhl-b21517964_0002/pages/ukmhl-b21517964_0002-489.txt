OBSERVATIONS ON PUS. 477 same writer has also described faithfully the appear- ance of the individual pus-globule, when carefully observed and subjected to the action of different agents. The result of his observations is, that the globule is composed of two parts,—an involucrum, which is rendered more transparent by water, spirit of wine, and acetic acid,—and of central granules, on which the agents mentioned have not the same effect; and, in consequence, they are rendered, by them, more conspicuous.* Mr. Gulliver, too, has recently directed his atten- tion to the same subject, and, quite independently, has arrived at the same conclusion relative to the compound nature of the pus-globule. This gentle- man considers the central granules, or, as he de- signates them, molecules, as composed of a peculiar principle, possessed of properties similar to those belonging to pyina.f Of the accuracy of the observations generally, on which this conclusion is founded, I have not the not for many hours; and these last, on microscopical examination, I have commonly found ill denned in form, and of a looser texture. * Vide Plate iii. figures 3, 4,5, copied from Dr. Gueterbock's work, representing, with tolerable accuracy, Fig. 3, recent pus-globules; Fig. 4, the same after immersion in water for some time, by which the transparency of their involucra is increased; and Fig. 5, the central granules: for further illustration a figure (No. 6) is given of the appearance of the pus-globules immersed in acetic acid, magnified about three hundred diameters, seen through the achromatic object glass of one-eighth of an inch focal distance, before often mentioned. f Vide London Medical Gazette, May 1839, for a notice of Mr. Gulliver's paper, " On the composition and elementary structure of the Pus-globule."

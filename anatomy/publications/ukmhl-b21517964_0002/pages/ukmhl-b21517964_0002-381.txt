369 AIR ON DEAD ANIMAL MATTER. carbonic acid gas generated in the two kinds of fer- mentation similar, then the analogy would be strong; but, in the putrid fermentation, the quantity of carbonic acid gas formed, independent of the oxygen of atmospheric air, is small, and the quan- tity of ammonia large. If the formation of am- monia, like that of carbonic acid gas, were usually attended with increase of temperature, then there would be reason to suppose that the fermenting pro- cess of animal matter throughout is a heating one. But, I know no proof, that heat is evolved in the union of the elements to form ammonia. In rela- tion to heat, it may be remarked, that azote and ammonia, and the combinations of the latter, and of most of the former, are peculiar and anomalous. Elastic fluids are formed by the sudden decomposi- tion of solid and liquid bodies (the detonating com- pounds) with little change of temperature,â€”and that an elevation, not a diminution of temperature. Ammoniacal gas unites respectively with the car- bonic, muriatic, and fluo-boracic acid gases, forming solid salts, without the production of heat; and as during the slow decomposition of ammonia by elec- tricity, there is no evidence of change of temperature, so equally there is want of evidence of the same in its formation. The probability therefore is, that its elements unite without evolution or generation of heat; and consequently in the putrid fermentation it cannot be considered as a cause of heat. VOL. II. B B

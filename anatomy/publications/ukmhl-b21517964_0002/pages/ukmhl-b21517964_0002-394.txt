382 ON THE MACERATION IN WATER OF separation of this, there remained a tissue of strong cellular texture, of vessels, nerves, and the branches of the duct, which, the maceration being continued, gradually softened and were very slowly decomposed. The duct itself resisted decomposition very power- fully, and so did a portion of the lining membrane of the mouth, in which it terminated, and from which in minute structure it was not distinguishable. Thyroid gland. (8.)—It underwent the same changes as the parotid, and in about the same time. When the poultaceous matter generated was ex- pressed, there remained also a tissue of nerves, and cellular texture. Prostate gland. (12.) — This organ changed rapidly, and was soon reduced to a soft poultaceous mass of a fawn colour, in which a vestige only of cellular tissue could be detected, and the remains of some small vessels. Kidney. (4.)—It gave off a good deal of the co- louring matter of the blood, and was soon reduced to a soft mass. After gentle pressure under water, there remained only the infundibula which had a delicate vascular structure, a few large vessels, its enveloping coat, and the lining membrane of the pelvis, which did not resist prolonged maceration for so long a period as the vessels and membranes of the spleen. Liver. (3. 4. 8. 9.)—It underwent change pretty rapidly, and in a manner not unlike the kidney. The water was first discoloured by blood, next by grey

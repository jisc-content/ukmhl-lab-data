160 EXPERIMENTS ON THE BLOOD merits to those inquirers who are more happily situa- ted than myself for engaging in them. I shall limit myself to the detail of some experiments instituted with a view of testing M. Magnus' general results. As a solution of potassa has the property of ab- sorbing carbonic acid gas, it follows that if mixed with the blood previous to being subjected to the air-pump, it will prove in some measure a test of the kind of air which the blood is capable of affording. With this intent two vials were prepared, the same as before used, one filled with distilled water the other with a weak aqueous solution of caustic potash, both carefully deprived of air by the air-pump. Ob- serving the same precautions as before, a portion of venous blood from a sheep was received into each of them. When less than half of the water and of the solution, as well as could be guessed, was ex- pelled, the vials were closed with the glass stoppers belonging to them, and instantly immersed in water, and as soon as possible subjected to the air-pump. The results of exhaustion in the two instances was perfectly distinct. From the blood mixed with water gas was disengaged; there was a continued ascension of bubbles. From the blood mixed with the alkaline solution no gas was liberated, excepting a bubble or two, which might fairly be considered as entangled air derived from contact of the blood with the stopper. A similar comparative trial was instituted with

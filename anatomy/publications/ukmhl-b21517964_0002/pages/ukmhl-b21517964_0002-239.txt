OTHER SECRETIONS, AND ON SOLID PARTS. 227 the fluid of the lateral ventricles of the brain. In three different instances (the limit of these trials) in which these fluids, a few hours after death, were sub- jected to the air-pump, no indications were afforded of the disengagement of air, excepting a minute bubble or two, which, probably it is right to infer, arose from air entangled in transferring the fluid from the peri- cardium and the ventricle into the vessel prepared for it. In the instance of the former, it was scooped out with a gallipot, from which distilled water, purged of air, had, the instant before, been emptied; in that of the latter, it was allowed to run into a vial nearly full of water, purged of air, through an open- ing in the posterior cornu. In a case of abdominal dropsy, in which it was necessary to draw off the accumulated fluid by the operation of paracentesis, the transparent serum of sp. grav. 1011 was agitated with common air in the double-mouthed bottle already mentioned, without the disengagement of any gas; which may be con- sidered equivalent to a negative result with the air- pump. As the serous fluids are commonly alkaline, [that is, contain an alkali not saturated fully with carbonic acid, and capable of absorbing a considerable ad- ditional proportion,] the probability is, that in their healthy normal state, they never contain this acid free or uncombined, nor is it likely, reasoning d priori, that they contain any other gas in a state of freedom or mere mechanical solution. q 2

OBSERVATIONS ON THE BLOOD '1V1 face. In some, in the same specimen, the particles exhibited these variations. In most cases in which gas was disengaged from the blood on agitation in common air, the blood-discs, under the microscope, appeared to have minute globules attached to them, and very often, instead of gliding on their flat sur- face, or with a revolving motion, they moved in the current, passing under the object-glass in a perpen- dicular position, as if suspended in this manner by particles of air adhering to their upper edge. Lastly, in every instance, without exception, in which, during life, there were purulent discharges, or purulent collections were detected after death, globules, like pus-globules, were visible, under the microscope, on dilution of the blood with water. I make mention of these globules in a guarded manner, from the circumstance that I have occasion- ally seen similar ones, in instances in which no sup- puration preceded death, and also in the blood of the sheep in perfect health. Thus, in the month of April, of the present year (1839), on examining, microscopically, the blood of six different sheep killed the same day,â€”without exception, particles resembling pus-globules were detected, using the same method as that just described. In these and in the former instances of the absence of the suppura- tive process, however, it deserves to be remarked, that the particles in question were fewer in number than in the cases first referred to. Till the exact nature of the pus-like globules is determined, their

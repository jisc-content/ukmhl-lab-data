IN CONNEXION WITH RESPIRATION. 151 gases, and that in no instance is the effect of dis- engagement of air from a fluid, agitated with another kind of air, greater than were it agitated in a vacuum. 3.â€” What is the Condition of the Alkali in the Blood in relation to Carbonic Acid ? On this point much difference of opinion exists amongst inquirers; some believing that the alkali, or at least a portion of it, is uncombined, or combined merely with water, or with water and albumen ; some that it is united to carbonic acid in the state of car- bonate ; others that it is saturated with this gas, and in the state of bicarbonate. The subject, it must be confessed, is one of great difficulty, and very perplexing; partly from the nature of the blood, liable to great variations during life, and to rapid change after death ; and partly also from the nature of the alkaline carbonates, hardly less disposed to change than the blood itself, from variation of circumstances, and to pass from one degree of combination into another. The bicarbonate of soda, I believe, like the bicar- bonate of ammonia, can only exist in perfection in the solid state. In dissolving, I find, when exposed to the atmosphere, it gives off a part of its acid, and still more when it is agitated with common air, and more still with hydrogen, and in a greater degree the higher the temperature. This is not favourable to the idea that it exists in the blood, especially when

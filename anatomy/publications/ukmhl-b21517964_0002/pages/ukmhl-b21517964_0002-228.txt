216 ON THE QUESTION OF FREE CARBONIC ACID country. In the Ionian Islands I used an air-pump, in good order, but not of great exhausting power. Recently the instrument I have employed has been of the best construction, the same as that referred to at page 155 of this volume. In both series of experiments, [taking proper pre- cautions as regards temperature, and the exclusion as much as possible of atmospheric air by receiving the urine, as voided, into vials scrupulously clean, and from which distilled water deprived of air by the air-pump had been the instant before emptied,] the results obtained were on the whole clear and satisfactory. In the majority of instances, when the exhaustion was carried as far as possible, the urine cooled below 60° remained perfectly tranquil,—indicating the total absence of any gas. In some comparatively few instances, air was dis- engaged. To determine the nature of the disen- gaged air, a little solution of pure potash was added to the urine, and the exhaustion was repeated. In every example that recourse was had to this test, the disengagement of air continued, clearly shewing that it was not carbonic acid; and rendering it pro- bable that it was entangled atmospheric air, intro- duced in the act of filling the vial,—it being difficult always to prevent the production of froth in this act, in a slight degree. In illustration, I may mention four trials of the same urine, made under circumstances, apparently

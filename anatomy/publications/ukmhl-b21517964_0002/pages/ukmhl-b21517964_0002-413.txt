DIFFERENT TEXTURES OF THE HUMAN BODY. 401 minute attention to these parts during a long period of maceration. The few observations which I have made in one instance, I shall communicate. Where the lining membrane of the nares joins the cutis, and where the cuticle of skin terminates, there, on maceration during fifteen days, I have noticed a kind of epithelium, at that time of curd-like con- sistence, not dissimilar to the covering of the roof of the mouth, admitting of being scraped off", rather than detached as a continuous surface. As it has proceeded inwards, it has rapidly diminished, and I have not been able to follow it more than half an inch in a satisfactory manner. The lining mem- brane of the nasal passages and cavities, has resisted decomposition for a considerable time, and in some measure according to its degree of thickness. The same remark is applicable to the lining membrane of the passages of the ear. The membrane of the eustachian tube, being comparatively thick, has borne maceration a very long time; whilst the ex- tremely delicate membrane of the tympanum has disappeared rapidly. Both the lining membrane of the nasal passages, and of the ear, have exhibited generally, during maceration, the character of a fibrous tissue, with mucous glandules enveloped in them, or subjacent to them. In the former I have been much at a loss to distinguish between the periosteum of the cavities, and the lining membrane of the cavities; and in the frontal and maxillary sinuses, and those of the sphenoidal bone, I am VOL.

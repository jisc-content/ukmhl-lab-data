ON THE BLOOD. 77 kept in a frozen state about twenty minutes,—the cruor about three or four. The blood was now placed in a room, the temperature of which was about 55°. It gradually thawed, and, when thawed, was liquid,—perhaps a little thicker than when first drawn. From the time it was completely melted, it began to coagulate in about eight minutes,—and, in about ten minutes, a soft crassamentum was formed. On examination, the following day, the crassamentum was found soft and not much con- tracted ; serum had separated from it distinctly. These results sufficiently accord with the more numerous experiments of Hewson, and in conse- quence, I am more disposed to consider his in- ference just, than the contrary one of Mr. Thack- rah. And, if we examine the detail of the experi- ments of this ingenious inquirer, this conclusion, I think, will be strengthened. In one experiment, after having been thawed, he states that a small quantity of serum separated from the blood; in another, when the thawed blood was mixed with water and passed through a filter, some very small portions of coagulum were retained ; and describing his results generally, he says, that the blood " on being afterwards thawed, becomes a grumous mass, and does not separate into serum and crassamen- tum." Now, the grumous mass, and the other particulars mentioned, indicate at least a certain degree of coagulation. As in one experiment, he appears to have placed the blood to thaw in a warm

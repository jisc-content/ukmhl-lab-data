18 EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS very nearly agrees with the estimate of Jurin, in- directly obtained, made more than a century ago.* The method by which I arrived at this result, was by putting a minute portion of blood, less than a drop, in solutions of different degrees of strength of sulphate of soda. In one of specific gravity 1090, the red particles slowly subsided: in that of the specific gravity above mentioned, when agitated in it, they remained for some time suspended, but rather inclining downwards than upwards. This was nearly a saturated solution at a temperature of about 120Â°: it ultimately deposited a considerable quantity of crystals; but it remained without change sufficiently long to allow of the trial described being made. This result is perhaps more deserving of confidence in as much as the red particles did not appear to be materially changed by the strong saline solution ; under the microscope they exhibited their usual disc-like form. Relative to the cruor, or admixture of the red par- ticles and serum, I may mention one or two trials which I have made on its specific gravity, weighing it in the usual manner. A mass of crassamentum from blood the specific gravity of the whole of which was 1055, and the serum of which was 1029, was broken up and subjected to moderate pressure in a linen bag with- out any addition of water. The liquid which passed through, consisting of red particles and a little serum, was found to be of specific gravity 1074. This * He estimated it at 1126. Phil. Trans, for 1719.

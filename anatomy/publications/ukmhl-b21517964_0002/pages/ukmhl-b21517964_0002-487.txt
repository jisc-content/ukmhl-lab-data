475 OBSERVATIONS ON PUS. and enters into the composition of the pus-globule, and that it is to it that the pus owes its colour and its cream-like character. In an instance of phthisis with much emaciation, I have detected it in the pus of a vomica; in which, it could hardly be expected to be found, unless essential. Of the substances inferred to exist in pus, and not soluble in alcohol, that which has been called pyina is the only one on which I shall offer any re- mark. Dr. Gueterbock, the discoverer of it in pus, and by whom it has been named, considers its cha- racters well marked as a proximate principle : namely, solubility in water, insolubility in alcohol and acetic acid, precipitation from solution in water by this acid, and non-conversion into gelatine by long-continued boiling. I would not wish to appear unduly sceptical: but I cannot refrain from doubt relative to the positive existence of this substance, independent of the means employed to procure it. It is possible that it may be formed by the action of acetic acid on the albuminous part of the pus. I have stated at page 95 of this volume, that the serum of the blood is not coagulated by strong acetic acid. I have since found, that although there is no effect immediately produced, nor for many hours, yet that there is in the course of many days, and that if the mixture of the serum and acid be kept, after a time it will be found jellied or feebly co- agulated ; and farther, that the gelatinous compound under the microscope exhibits very minute globules.

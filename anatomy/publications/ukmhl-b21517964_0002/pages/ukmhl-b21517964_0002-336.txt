EFFECTS OF BOILING ON THE 324 be diffused through it. The sub-mucous, cellular, and the muscular coats were affected much in the same manner as those of the stomach and intestines. 22. No cuticle or epithelium was discoverable in the larynx, or in any part of the aspera arteria. It was very carefully sought after, on the supposition, that it might exist of a very delicate nature. The lining membrane of the larynx was found to be semi-transparent, elastic and gelatinous ; the corda? vocales were similar, as also the connecting membrane of the cartilages of the trachea. 23. The cartilages of the larynx had become much swollen and broken ; portions of them were project- ing out. They were very soft, nearly transparent, and quite gelatinous. The change in the epiglottis was less strongly marked than in the firmer carti- lages ; it was less uniformly swollen, soft, and trans- parent. The perichondrium generally was rendered gelatinous. 24. The cartilage of patella was found soft and semi-transparent, like stiff jelly. 25. The lining membrane of the capsule had become soft, rather gelatinous, and slightly adhesive. 26. The cellular membrane, surrounding the bursa, between the patella and the skin, was found soft, gela- tinous, and ropy, admitting of being drawn out into threads possessing some elasticity. 27. The cutis over the patella was much corru- gated ; it had become soft, friable, and a little gela- tinous ; one surface was more gelatinous, the other

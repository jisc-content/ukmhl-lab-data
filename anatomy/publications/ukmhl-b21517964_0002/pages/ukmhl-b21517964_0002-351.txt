339 AIR ON DEAD ANIMAL MATTER. pressure; but if oxygen was absorbed chemically, there is no reason to suppose it would produce any difference of effect except in degree. The experiments, of which I have just related the results in part, were, as already mentioned, all made at a comparatively high atmospheric tempera- ture,—favourable to rapid putrefaction. The de- gree of rapidity of change, I may remark, varied according to the nature of the texture. Brain, muscle, spleen, liver, and the substance of the glands generally, produced the most rapid change. In a few hours carbonic acid gas might be detected in the air exposed to them; and generally in less than twenty-four hours there was air generated, and an increase in the volume of the air. The soft white parts were next in degree of rapidity,—such as the cutis, periosteum, dura mater, and I may add, stomach, intestinal canal, vein, artery, and adipose structure. Over these, in about twenty-four hours, carbonic acid gas could generally be detected in the air; and generally, in about forty-eight or seventy- two hours, a little air was generated. Tendon, intervertebral substance, cartilage, cuticle and bone, were slowest in progress. In two or three days, carbonic acid appeared in the air in which they were contained; but many days elapsed, before there was any increase of volume indicating the generation of gas, excepting the parts belonging to a young animal. After the putrefactive process had commenced, it proceeded, although the oxygen of z 2

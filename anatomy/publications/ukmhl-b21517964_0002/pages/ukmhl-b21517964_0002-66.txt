54 EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS with microscopical observations: " ideo fatendum est, gluten album sanguineum lubricam et fluidam consistentiam retinere dum in animale vivente move- tur." These just views may have been adopted by a small number of individuals, but they seem to have made no general impression at the time, or to have been objected to, or rejected, as if erroneous.* For a considerable period after Harvey's great discovery,— for nearly a century, whilst many branches of physi- cal science were most successfully cultivated, com- paratively little advance was made in the knowledge of the true nature of the blood. The attention of the philosophical chemists was then chiefly directed to the effects of heat on it, and to the products obtainable by distillation ; f whilst that of the natural philosopher and physician was directed, prin- * Haller, in his Comment, on Boerhaave, vol. ii. p. 310, pub- lished in 1742, referring to the opinion that the clot contains fibrous matter,—the opinion he says, of Malpighi, Michelotti, Guglielmini, Hacquet, and of Adams; observes, " Verum, ne errori nascatur locus, fibrosa ea substantia non alia est ab ipsis globulis dictis («'. e. of Leeuwenhoeck) et evanescit solo calore." t Macquer, one of most philosophical chemists of his time, in his Elements of Chemistry, published towards the middle of the last century, speaks of the analysis of the blood, as " a sort of general, though imperfect, analysis of the animal." Speaking of the blood out of the body, he notices only " its yellowish serum or lymph," and the red curdled part which swims in the midst thereof. He adds, " these two substances, when analysed, yield nearly the same prin- ciples ; and, in that respect, seem to differ but little from each other." —Elements of the Theory and Practice of Chemistry, Eng.

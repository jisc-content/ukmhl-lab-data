246 THE AGE OF MORBID ADHESIONS; * 6 grs. of the salt were dissolved in 12 ounces of water. clear serum and well formed crassamentum) was of a bright yellow hue; the liquor pericardii was nearly colourless. Three drops of the solution of triple prussiate mixed with half an ounce of serum, tested in the same manner as the liquor pericardii, exhibited as nearly as possible the same degree of colour. Whence it may be inferred that extremely little of the solution passed into or was retained in the pericardium; that the greater part of it passed into the lungs,â€”and that the liquor pericardii was not a post-mortem exudation, but a vital secretion. Experiment 2. On the 15th September, injected into the jugular of a body, extremely emaciated, which had been dead nineteen hours, nine ounces of a stronger solu- tion of the triple prussiate ;* and made the post- mortem examination two hours after. The cir- cumstances of the case were favourable; there was no serious disease of the lungs, none of the heart; the age of the deceased was 37 ; the principal lesions were softening of the brain, especially of the fornix, and dropsical effusion into the cavity of the abdomen. In the pericardium about an ounce of fluid was found :'tested by the salt of iron and nitric acid, it indicated the presence of a very minute quantity of the triple prussiate; it acquired a very light greenish hue.

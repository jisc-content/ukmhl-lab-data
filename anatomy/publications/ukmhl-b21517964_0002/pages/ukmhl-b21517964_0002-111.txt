99 ON THE BLOOD. made in England, in January, on the blood of a young man, which was healthy in appearance. It appeared to prevent putrefaction. Gum-arabic, added in the state of fine powder, did not appear to retard the coagulation of blood, ex- cepting, perhaps, in a very slight degree. The coagulum formed was very soft, and it contracted very little. Mucilage of gum-arabic, retarded it about twenty-four hours. Oil of turpentine, also, perhaps retarded the coagulation of the blood in a very slight degree. The effect on the colour of the blood was more dis- tinct ; the oil changed it to a brownish hue. Cantharides in powder did not appear to retard coagulation ; the crassamentum remained soft, and not contracted. Red precipitate neither retarded coagulation, or the contraction of the crassamentum when formed, nor consequently the separation of the serum. Iodine did not appear to retard or accelerate coagulation. Eight grains of it were added to an ounce and half of blood. It rendered the blood brownish. (2.)â€”Of those substances which retard or prevent coagulation. The following substances, which I have tried, belong- to this class; viz. rhubarb, ipecacuanha, cinchona, columba, myrrh, catechu, jalap, the extracts prepared in vacuo of belladonna, digitalis, aconite, conium h 2

IN CONNEXION WITH RESPIRATION. 159 5.â€” Of the Air or Gases contained in the Blood capable of being extricated by the Air-pump. As already mentioned, M. Magnus has stated that these gases are carbonic acid, oxygen and azote in notable quantities. Taking the mean of ten of his experiments on the blood of the horse and calf (five on arterial and five on venous), the total quantity of the mixed gases he obtained was, in the instance of arterial blood, 10*4 per cent, per volume, and in that of venous 7*6 per cent.; the former consisting of about 6*5 carbonic acid, 2*4 oxygen, 1*5 azote; the latter of 5*5 carbonic acid, 1*1 oxygen, l'O azote. On a subject of so much importance, it is very desirable that the experiments of M. Magnus should be repeated and verified ; for until this is done, con- sidering the physiological history of the blood, it will be difficult to avoid doubt, it will be difficult to depend on them with that degree of confidence which is justly due only to well-authenticated facts. The ingenious apparatus employed by M. Magnus being of complex construction, and not easily used excepting in a well-appointed laboratory, I must leave the repetition of his highly interesting experi-

TEXTURES OF THE HUMAN BODY. 325 more friable. The outer surface was rough, from little protuberances of a gelatinous kind. 28. The skin of the scrotum appeared somewhat similar, but without the insulated little masses of jelly on its surface. 29. Its cellular membrane had become soft, gela- tinous, and ropy. The tunica vaginalis was very similar ; it was equably gelatinous and soft. 30. The albuginea was rendered soft and friable, not viscid. In appearance, it approached somewhat to the cartilage of patella, but was less transparent. 31. The testicle was found firm and very friable. 32. The conjunctiva of eye had become rather gelatinous, soft, and adhesive. 33. The cornea was rendered translucent, and friable, like the albuginea. 34. The sclerotic coat was similar: the cornea and this coat were not separable.* 35. The lens had become opaque white, firm and very friable,—not in the slightest degree gelatinous : it broke up into concentric laminae. * An eye, an inch in diameter, measured from the entrance of the optic nerve to the cornea, and transversely, immersed in boiling water about ten minutes, was found contracted to a diameter of £gth of an inch; and the cornea from §$th to fgth ; the latter was not cor- rugated or diminished in transparency. The boiling was then con- tinued about ten hours ; the globe was still more contracted, but the sclerotic having burst, it was not easy to measure it; the cornea was reduced to igtli of an inch. It and the sclerotic had become soft, not gelatinous; the one retained a considerable degree of transparency, and the other had acquired it.

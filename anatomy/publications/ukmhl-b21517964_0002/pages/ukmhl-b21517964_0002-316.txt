ACTION OF LIME, ETC. 304 parative experiments, made on the same leaves and flower, with magnesia and water, and a solution of carbonate of potash (the old sub-carbonate). Both mixtures were made on the 23d June, 1836, and they were both examined on the 4th November, 1838. There was a marked contrast between them. The leaves and flower, with the magnesia water, retained their form unaltered, and their texture did not appear to be materially weakened,—they bore being shaken in the bottle without falling to pieces, and the water was only just perceptibly coloured greenish, and the magnesia brownish, the leaves re- taining their colour unimpaired. The leaves and flowers, on the contrary, in the alkaline solution, were reduced to small pieces, and seemed to be wasted and deprived very much of their colouring matter, and in a pultaceous state ; the solution was of a dark olive green ; evaporated, it yielded a re- sidue abounding in colouring matter. Lime, in its solvent power, is probably intermediate in degree, between magnesia and the more active alkali—more active even in combination with one proportion of carbonic acid, than the magnesia, or even lime in a caustic state. The application of the preceding results to agri- culture, in relation to manures, I must decline dis- cussing; the subject is one of too much importance, and magnitude, and difficulty, to be lightly entered on.

ACTION OF CORROSIVE SUBLIMATE 282 It is noted down at the time, (hat when the dif- ferent parts above-mentioned, were examined on the 25th of May, they were all comparatively pale, ap- peared to be condensed, and emitted no unpleasant smell, and were perfectly distinguishable: a little calomel had formed on the sides of the glass-vessel in which the experiments had been made. And, also, that when examined, on the 6th July, they appeared to be exactly in the same state. The solution itself seemed to be but little altered ; it con- tained only a very trifling sediment. Evaporated to dryness, it yielded a fawn coloured residue, which, strongly heated, first gave off fumes of corrosive sublimate ; next, whiter and denser fumes, as if of calomel; and, lastly, an ammoniacal vapour : a small quantity of carbonaceous matter remaining. On examining the subjects of the experiments, after they had been dried, with a powerful lens, minute crystals of corrosive sublimate were perceived in several of them, principally in those the weight of which was most increased. To separate the loosely adhering salt, they were immersed and left in water, from the 8th to the 15th July, during which time the water was frequently changed. They were then again weighed, after thorough drying on a vapour bath. The following Table exhibits the results.

87 ON THE BLOOD. mentum of the blood, and the results have been similar. The temperature of the cold crassamentum was not raised, and the coagulation of the fluid blood was not prevented. Merely hypothetically considered, I do not com- prehend how either oxygen, hydrogen, or azote, or any other gas which is not absorbed rapidly by the blood, can materially affect the coagulation of this fluid, or can be the means of producing a sensible evolution of caloric, at least by the simple contact of surfaces. I would remark, however, that I do not consider the negative results of my experiments with oxygen in the slightest degree hostile to that view of the generation of animal heat, in which the chief source of it is referred to the lungs. I need not say, that there is an im- measurable difference between the natural process of respiration and the rude experiments just now alluded to, whether we consider the apparatus, the material, or the situation, and more particularly when we consider that in one instance vitality is present, and in the other that life is extinct, and the agents are merely chemical and dead. I must confess too, that, viewed hypothetically, I am equally at a loss to conceive how carbonic acid gas should retard the coagulation of the blood. If it were true, that blood abounds in carbonic acid gas, and the coagulation of the blood depends on the evolution of carbonic acid gas, then in the act of coagulating, it ought not to absorb an additional

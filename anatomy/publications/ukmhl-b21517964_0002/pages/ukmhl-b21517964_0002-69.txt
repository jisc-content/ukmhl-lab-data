And he adds, " This I thought it necessary to observe, because many of them have since appeared in other publications." Thus, in another place, also in a foot-note, after describing the crassamentum, which, he says, " it is well known consists of two parts, of which one gives it solidity, and is by some called the fibrous part of the blood, or the gluten, but by others with more propriety termed the coagulable lymph" remarks, "It may be proper to mention here, that till of late, the coagulable lymph has been confounded with the serum of the blood, which con- tains a substance that is likewise coagulable.

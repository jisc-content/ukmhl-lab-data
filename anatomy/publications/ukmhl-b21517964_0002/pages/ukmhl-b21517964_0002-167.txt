IN CONNEXION WITH RESPIRATION. 155 a notable quantity, and from arterial as well as venous blood, and not only of carbonic acid, but also of oxygen and azote.* M. Magnus attributes the failures of former ex- perimenters to their having used pumps of imper- fect exhausting power, or to their not having carried the exhaustion sufficiently far. In my early and first trial I employed the air pump belonging to the laboratory of the Royal Institution, which was an excellent one, and which I then believed was in good order; but I might have been mistaken. To endeavour to satisfy myself on this point, I have had an air-pump constructed for the purpose, under the direction of an able artist, Mr. Ross, of 33, Regent Street, already distinguished for his ex^ cellent achromatic microscopes, and it has answered perfectly. When the exhaustion has been carried as far as possible, the difference of level of the mer- cury in the siphon-gauge has not exceeded a tenth of an inch, and over water has not exceeded the quarter of an inch. Experimenting with this machine on blood, col- lected with such precautions as I believe to have been adequate to insure accuracy of results, in a majority of instances the disengagement of gas has ologicis ad illustrandam doctrinam de respiratione institutis Heidelb. 1837â€”p. 9 et seq. * Annales des Sciences Nat. torn. viii. p. 79, et seq. contain a trans- lation of M.

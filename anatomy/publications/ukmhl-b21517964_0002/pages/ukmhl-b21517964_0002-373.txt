361 AIR ON DEAD ANIMAL MATTER. exist, contained in the fibrin of the blood, in mus- cular fibre, and in the parenchymatous substance of the very putrescible organs in large proportion, which may act as leaven in animal compounds; and I might mention some facts in support of the notion, were I not apprehensive of extending this part of the subject beyond its due limits, and the more so, as I wish briefly to advert to one or two other points of considerable theoretical interest. After witnessing the change which takes place in muscular fibre, in consequence of putrefaction giving rise to a fluid very like chyme in appearance, I was disposed to ask, may it not be concerned in digestion itself, according to the earliest theoretical notions on this subject ? and also, after observing the effects of the putrefactive process in raising the temperature, to inquire, may it not in the stomach and intestines, be one of the sources of animal heat? Meat slightly putrid, we know, is highly nutritive, and very easily digested. When meat is becoming tender by keeping, it is in an incipient state of putrefaction ; the muscular fibre is losing its co- hesion ; the textures generally in a very minor de- gree are doing the same, and carbonic acid gas is forming, as I have ascertained by experiment. Now, as we know, that carbonic acid gas is formed in, or disengaged from the stomach and intestines, even when the function of digestion is apparently in its healthy state, it does not seem unreasonable to consider this gas a product of digestion, almost as

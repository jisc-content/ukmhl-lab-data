EXPERIMENTS ON THE BLOOD 182 according to the commonly received view, oxygen is the cause of the bright hue of the arterial fluid,— and its consumption and conversion into carbonic acid, the cause of the dark hue of the venous,—the saline serum being negative in regard to colour, its chief use being to preserve the red globules from injury, prevent the solution of their colouring matter, retain their forms unchanged, and to bear them in their course through the circulation.* Why oxygen should render the colouring matter of the blood scarlet; why its conversion into car- bonic acid should change the scarlet to a darker hue; and what is the true shade of colour, of the colouring matter of the blood, are questions, to which, I believe, the present state of our knowledge does not admit of a reply in a satisfactory manner. The colouring principle of the blood-corpuscles, in its perfect state, can hardly be considered precisely the same as the hematosine extracted from them; the former is not soluble in serum,—the latter is; nor have I found the colour of the latter in solution affected by oxygen ; consequently, we cannot, with * The conclusion relative to the colour of the blood,—and espe- cially its modification by neutral salts, acids, and alkalies, and other agents, to which my experiments have led me, is very similar to that of Dr. Wells, deduced by him from a somewhat different train of experiments and reasoning, more than forty years ago, as described in his very ingenious paper, entitled " Observations and Experiments on the Colour of the Blood," published in the Philosophical Transac- tions for 1/97. This paper, which has been much overlooked of late years, is every way worthy of the very original mind of its author, and will, even now, well repay the perusal.

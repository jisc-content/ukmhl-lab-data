AND ON THE FLOW OF THE BILE. 429 have I found the termination of the biliary duct minutely described, so as to be able to compare it with the human. The few observations, which I had an opportunity of making, seem to show that this duct at and towards its termination in the intestine in animals of different families, is somewhat various. As the varieties tend to confirm the use of the valvular structure in man, I shall briefly notice them. In the cat, the biliary and pancreatic tubes are very similar to those of man in the manner in which they terminate ; and they are similarly provided with valvular processes, and proportionally, even more strongly developed. In the ox and sheep, the pancreatic duct termi- nates apart from the common gall-duct. In the gall-duct of the former, the processes are shorter comparatively than those of man, thicker and rounded, and are confined to the margin of its mouth. In that of the sheep, there is hardly a trace of them, even at the mouth of the duct.* In the horse and elephant, both of which, as it is well known, are destitute of a gall bladder, the ter- minal structure of the ducts under consideration is very similar. It is distinctly valvular, and in a manner bringing to recollection the valvulae conni- * The pancreatic duct in man, at least of Europeans, rarely termi- nates apart in the intestine; in one instance in which I found it so terminating, the valvular structure of the ductus communis chole- dochus was unusually indistinct.

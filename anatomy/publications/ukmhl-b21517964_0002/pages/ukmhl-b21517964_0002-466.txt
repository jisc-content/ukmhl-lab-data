454 ON THE MALE ORGANS of the abdomen, and in the only instance examined, that of the spotted ray, it was actually detected in the connecting tubes; may it not be inferred, and is not the conclusion unavoidable, that the old opinion respecting the functions of these different parts is correct, and in accordance with the names which they have received ? The evidence, on which this conclusion is founded, is manifestly of two kinds; one anatomical; the other microscopical, connected with the constitution of the spermatic fluid. Preparations have been made of the parts shewing the tubular connexion, which are deposited in the collection of comparative anatomy belonging to the Museum at Fort Pitt. Relative to the evidence derived from the nature of the spermatic fluid, I apprehend, now, it will generally be admitted as satisfactory. I have examined the spermatic fluid of many species of mammalia, and the animalcules contained in it were in no instance more distinct than those of these fishes; indeed in the latter they were perfectly so, and their character well marked. They were immediately killed by spirit of wine ; they were torpid and motionless in a saturated solution of common salt; they became active when the solution was diluted ;* and in the * The effect of fresh and of salt water on the spermatic entozoa of fishes which hreed in the sea and in rivers and lakes, will probably be found to be opposite. This conjecture, I found on the observa- tions mentioned above, of the different effects of fresh and salt water on the animalcules of the rays, in connexion with the addi- tional one, that the spermatic animalcules of the milt of the salmon

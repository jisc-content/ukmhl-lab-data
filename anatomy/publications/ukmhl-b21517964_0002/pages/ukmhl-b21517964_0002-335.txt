TEXTURES OF THE HUMAN BODY. 323 16. The peritoneal coat generally was rendered soft; in some places it was rather gelatinous and slightly viscid, in others friable. 17. The inner coat of the urinary bladder and of the upper part of the urethra, had become slightly gelatinous and diaphanous. 18. The muscular coat of the former was deli- cately displayed; its fibres appeared very distinct; they were very friable. 19- The cuticle of the tongue was rendered soft and very friable, and was very easily detached. It was thick above and spongy ; extremely thin below, and over the fraenum indistinct. I attempted to trace it in continuation. Over the cryptae of the amygdalae I could not detect it; nor in a satisfactory manner in the pharynx, in the immediate vicinity of the amygdalae. The cryptse and contiguous lining membrane had become gelatinous. In the oesopha- gus, the cuticle was very manifest, easily separable, indeed scarcely adherent, and very friable. 20. The cutis of the under surface of the tongue, extremely thin, was rendered slightly gelatinous and semi-transparent. The thick cutis of upper surface had become rather friable, especially the papillae, as if composed chiefly of vessels. When it was removed, gelatinous projections were seen rising from the mus- cular coat corresponding to the papillae. 21. The mucous coat of oesophagus had become rather friable; some gelatinous matter appeared to y 2

ON THE MALE ORGANS •152 organ A similar structure exists in the same situa- tion in the thornbaek and torpedo. In the sac of the gland a cream-like secretion was found, and the same flowed out pretty copiously through the excretory ducts when pressure was ap- plied to the gland. This fluid was neither acid nor alkaline; it was slightly viscid; applied to the tongue, no sensation was immediately produced; perhaps there was an after one approaching to acrid, but so slight as to be doubtful. Under the micro- scope, it was found to abound in very minute dense spherical particles, twenty of which at least would be required to form a mass equal to a blood corpuscle of man. They had no appearance of independent vitality, and moved only when in currents. The blood in the pulsating cavity, from which it is pro- bable that the secretion just mentioned is formed, coagulated like ordinary blood on exposure to the air; but it was more dilute, and, what is remarkable, under the microscope, its particles appeared to be smaller, and the majority of them not elliptical but globular. How the anal appendages are constituted in sharks, I cannot speak from my own observations, having yet examined these organs only in one in- stance,—that of Scyllium Edwardii, before referred to. From the descriptions of naturalists, it may be inferred that they vary more or less in organization, in different genera,—that in some, as probably in the genus Carcharias, there is a distinct gland, se-

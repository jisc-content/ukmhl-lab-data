340 ON THE AGENCY OF ATMOSPHERIC The surface was then soft, brownish and fetid; what was below the surface was apparently little altered. The temperature of the brain continued increasing till the 21st, when it had risen 11°, then its surface was covered with froth; larvae of large size were in great plenty, and were feeding greedily; and the odour was strongly ammoniacal. From this time the temperature gradually fell. On the 31st, it was only 2° higher than the water; on the 1st August only 1°; and on the 4th, there was no difference. At this time, its surface was grey, soft, of saponaceous appearance, free from larva?, and emitting a powerful ammoniacal odour; and even then, two inches below the surface, it appeared to be but little changed. The experiments with brain No. 1, was begun on the 25th July. The highest temperature attained by it was only 1° above that of the water; and on the 11th August, it was the same as that of the water. In this instance, the number of larvae generated on its surface was less than in the former; their growth was less rapid ; they fed with less avidity,—the surface was compa- ratively tranquil, and the ammoniacal odour com- paratively faint; and latterly a rancid peculiar odour was rather predominant. Lung.—It belonged to body No. 1, and was put into the vessel for observation, divided into portions not very small. The highest temperature which it acquired was on the 30th July, then the water being 77°; its temperature, at the surface, and just below

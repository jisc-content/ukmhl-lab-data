75 ON THE BLOOD. coagulation. My own results are in conformity with this, and with the results of the accurate Hewson, that the viscidity of the blood is, at the same time, increased. At the temperature of 32°, I have seen blood remain liquid more than an hour ; a reduction of temperature, some degrees lower, was required to freeze it,—when it appeared as a homogeneous mass. Hewson, from his experiments on the freezing of the blood, inferred, that its qualities were not thus altered; that when thawed, it returned to its liquid state, and that it was then subject to coagulate. He speaks very decidedly on this point: he says,—" the blood was always evidently fluid on being thawed,— and as evidently jellied when exposed to the air."* Mr. Thackrah, from his experiments, infers the contrary, viz.—that by freezing, the blood perma- nantly loses its power of coagulating.f The few experiments which I have made on this subject, instituted long before I had seen Mr. Thackrah's book, perfectly agree in their results with those of Mr. Hewson. I shall describe them from notes taken at the time, in the month of January, 1828, at Corfu.

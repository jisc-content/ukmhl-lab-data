ON THE BLOOD. 41 in the autumn. With one or two exceptions, the patients from whom the blood was taken, were soldiers of our regiments serving in the Ionian Islands. As regards salubrity, these islands may be considered as intermediate in degree between England and Ceylon; the average mortality in them amongst the troops being about 2*3 per cent, of the strength. Both the fevers and dysentery are less severe and fatal, than the same diseases within the tropics, and especially the latter. The experiments were principally instituted with a view to endeavour to determine two doubtful points :—1st, whether there is any constant relation, between the specific gravity of the blood and its capability of yielding a buffy coat; and, 2dly, whether the proportion of fibrin is augmented in blood possessing this quality. Relative to the first point, by one inquirer, it has been maintained that " blood which gives the fib- rinous coat in a great degree, has a lower specific gravity than healthy blood ;"*—at the same time remarking, " that moderately sizy blood drawn from a person before he becomes weakened, has not commonly a very low specific gravity." The results of the trials contained not only in this table, but also in the two preceding tables, are not in accordance with the first conclusion. The only fair inference, it appears to me, that can be * Sir Charles Scndamore, Essay on the Blood, p. 35.

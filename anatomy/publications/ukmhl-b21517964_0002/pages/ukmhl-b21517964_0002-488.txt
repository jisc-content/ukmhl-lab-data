OBSERVATIONS ON PUS. 476 Now, is it not possible that this acid on the serous fluid of pus may have a more rapid effect, and pro- duce instantly a substance, a form of albumen, such as that which has been called pyina? The pro- perties of animal and vegetable substances are so easily altered, by feeble agencies, sometimes with, sometimes without, new arrangements of their ele- ments, independent of any alteration in their pro- portions, that great caution requires to be observed relative to the adoption of new proximate principles. 7.—Dr. Gueterbock has given a very good ac- count of the pus-particles, under microscopical exami- nation, with which my observations perfectly accord. After remarking that they vary in size, and that hitherto those of the greatest magnitude only have been described by authors, he adds,—" Corpuscula majora formam habent paene rotundam, et sphsericam, quam, si aqua evaporante magna natant celeritate, luculenter videre potes. Et forma et magnitudine paulo discrepant, alia (et major quidem pars) satis rotunda, alia irregularia, marginibus aliorum acutis, aliorum crenatis, superficie in plerisque rugata, mo- rorum non dissimilis, ita ut, qui primum ea videant, alia granula minora supersedere credat."* The * When pus is mixed largely with water, and thrown on a filter, the greater part of it is retained on the filter; a small portion passes through with the water; under the microscope, the particles of the latter appear more irregular in form, and most of them smaller than those of the former. Also, when largely diluted with water, in a tall jar, and set aside at rest, a difference will be found in the time of subsidence of the particles, some falling down immediately, others

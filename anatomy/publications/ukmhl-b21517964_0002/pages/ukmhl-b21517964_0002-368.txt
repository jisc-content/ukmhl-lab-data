356 ON THE AGENCY OF ATMOSPHERIC been isolated. Whether the presence of oxygen is essential to the commencement of the vinous fer- mentation is matter of doubt. But the presence of oxygen seems to be undoubtedly necessary to the com- mencement of the putrid fermentation, and only to its commencement, as we have seen that it goes on over mercury, after atmospheric air has been entirely excluded.* The products of the vinous fermentation in the simplest form, appear to be very few. Al- cohol is the only liquid product known,—and car- bonic acid gas I believe is the only essential gaseous product. The disengagement of azote, probably, when it occurs, is accidental; may it not be re- ferred in the early stage of the process to the at- mospheric air entangled in the materials, and in the advanced stage to the decomposition of a little leaven ? I have made many experiments on this subject, which have led me to this conclusion. The products of the putrid fermentation seem to be * From experiments already related, it appears that venous blood as well as arterial, contains oxygen in a peculiar state of combina- tion associated with the red particles : this oxygen may be sufficient to excite putrefaction after death, in every part of the body pene- trated by the blood independent, of the atmosphere; and to account for the very rapid manner in which bodies putrefy, if abounding in blood, as is often the case in instances of sudden death, and for their putrefying under water in instances of death from drowning. The very tympanitic state which bodies acquire so circumstanced,—indi- cates, that their different textures, especially the integuments, are little pervious to air,—which is also in accordance with the results of Priestley's observations on the power of bladder when thoroughly wet to confine air.

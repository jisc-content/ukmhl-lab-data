OBSERVATIONS ON PUS. 467 This variableness of specific gravity is probably owing to two circumstances, chiefly,—to variable pro- portions of the ingredients of the specimens tried, and the variable density of the liquid part. If, caeteris paribus, the liquid part of the pus predomi- nates, it will probably be of comparatively low specific gravity; if the concrete part is in excess, the pus-globules, it will probably be of high specific gravity.* The pus-globules themselves, I believe to be not less heavy than the blood corpuscles ; I have come to this conclusion by mixing small portions of pus with solutions of sulphate of soda, of different de- grees of strength ; with one of specific gravity 1132, the globules were for a time suspended, slowly subsiding rather than rising towards the surface; and, in this instance, when examined by the microscope, the form of the globules did not appear to have undergone any distinct change.f What the specific gravity of the liquid portion is, I have never ascertained in any example; it is, in- deed, a point difficult to determine, unless a large * Dr. Pearson, in his paper entitled Observations and Experi- ments on Pas," in Philosophical Transactions, for 1810, notices four Irinds of pus. —1, The cream-like and equally consistent ; 2, the curdy and unequal in consistence; 3, the serous and thin kind; 4, the thick, viscid, or slimy. He states that he found the specific gravity of each kind very similar. t Concentrated solution of sulphate of soda imparts viscidity to pus,—but move slowly and in a less degree than muriate of ammo- nia, and appears to have less effect on the general appearance of the pus-globule.

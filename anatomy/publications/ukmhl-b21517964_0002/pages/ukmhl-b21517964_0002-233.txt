I am not aware of any attempts hitherto made to endeavour to determine, whether milk contains free carbonic acid, or that any opinion even has been hazarded on the subject. Both at Corfu, and recently in this country, I have subjected milk to the air-pump. The results of the best conducted experiments have been negative. At Corfu, in 1828, I made trial of woman's milk, and of cow's milk ; only a very few bubbles of air were extricated on exhaustion ; no more than it might be fairly inferred were entangled in the fluid as it was expressed from the nipple into the receiving vessel. In this country I have experimented only on cow's milk. When precaution was taken to prevent frothing, as by expressing the milk from the nipple, immersed in water deprived of air by the air- pump, in the manner analogous to that used in the

AIR ON DEAD ANIMAL MATTER. '.\55 the temperature of the mixture rises several de- grees. 4.—Some General Remarks on the Putrefactive Process. What is animal putrefaction, or the putrid fer- mentation ? I am not aware that this question has yet been replied to, in a satisfactory manner, or that the present state of our information is such as to admit of making the reply free from many ob- scurities. The little information I have collected bearing on the subject, I shall bring forward without hesitation. Under diminished pressure, conducted in tubes over mercury, the putrid fermentation appears in some of its changes analogous to the vinous. The elements of vinous fermentation ap- pear to be leaven, which remains unaltered,* and sugar which undergoes change; and the helping circumstances, a certain degree of dilution with water, and a certain temperature. The elements of the putrid fermentation are less distinct. If there be, as is probable, an animal leaven, it has not yet * The same portion of leaven may be repeatedly used. I have preserved the leaven obtained from the grape for nearly twelve months, by pouring off the fermented fluid, as soon as the leaven had subsided, and adding fresh sugar and water. How leaven acts is one of the mysteries of chemistry, and there are others of a like kind,—as the influence of carbonate of lime in the formation of salt- petre,—of sulphuric acid in the formation of sugar from starch, &c.

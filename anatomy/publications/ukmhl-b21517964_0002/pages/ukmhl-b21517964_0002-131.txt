ON THE BLOOD. 119 in want of indication of vitality from the lens of the eye, from bone, cartilage, tendon, and even the blood-vessels themselves. It is not necessary to insinuate, if the former are dead, why not the latter ? But, it might be urged rather, if the latter possess life, why not the former ? Is it not as reasonable to suppose hair, or the cuticle alive, as the substance of an adhesion formed of effused coagulable lymph. Or, taking a wider range of argument, the mystery of the subject may be dwelt on. It may be asked, is it more mysterious or inexplicable that a dead fluid should circulate in living vessels, than that dead parts should be attached to living parts ? Is it more mys- terious, that one kind of fluid, the spermatic, should excite an ovum to change, development, and growth, than another kind of fluid, milk or broth (both having been previously subjected to the boiling tempera- ture) should nourish an animal, supplying new living particles to the body; in excess occasioning growth in infancy; in deficiency, decay in old age. The serum of the blood, after coagulation, apart from the clot, may be injected into the vessels of a living animal, and will circulate without deleterious effects. The cruor, after the separation and coagulation of the fibrin, after having been out of the body several hours, may also be injected into the blood-vessels, and resume its place in the circulation, without injurious effects ;* if dead, acting as if alive, and * Provided it is not from a different class, or even species, of ani- mals j if the former, a fatal effect is rapid ; if the latter, the effect is

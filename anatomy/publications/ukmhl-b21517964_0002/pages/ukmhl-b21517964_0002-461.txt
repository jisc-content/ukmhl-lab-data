OF THE CARTILAGINOUS FISHES. 449 mides were large, as were also the vasa deferentia, which terminated, as in the foregoing instances of the ray, in a kind of urethra, connecting the urinary bladder with the cloaca. Having found that the spermatic animalcules of the mammalia, are but little liable to change,—that they may be detected even in a putrescent fluid, and may be kept for many months, and probably years in spirit of wine,—I thought it worth while to ex- amine, with the microscope, any fluid that might be found in the vasa deferentia of this scyllium: a little turbid fluid mixed with grumous matter was procured by laying them open, in which when di- luted, animalcules were distinctly seen, resembling much those of the rays. This result induced me to try the contents of the testes, and of the vasa deferentia of the torpedo. The experiments were made with two fishes, varieties of the tremola, rather below the middle size, which I had sent home from Malta, more than four years before, preserved in spirits. The vasa deferentia of both were large, and when opened, afforded pretty much opaque white semifluid matter. When di- luted with water, and placed under the microscope, animalcules were distinctly visible in it; thread-like, serpentine, and finely tapering towards one extre- mity, very similar to those of the common ray and thornback, but decidedly smaller. And animal- cules of precisely the same kind, but less numerous^ were detected in the semifluid opaque matter in vol. ii. <; o

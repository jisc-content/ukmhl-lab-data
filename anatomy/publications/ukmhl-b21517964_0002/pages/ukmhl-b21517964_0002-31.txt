19 ON THE BLOOD. cruor was next poured on a filter of cotton cloth, to drain off as much as possible of the serum. It was left for twenty-four hours covered over with a glass receiver to prevent loss by evaporation. Now weighed again it was found of the increased specific gravity 1087. It was of the consistence of melasses; and was not further concentrated by being kept in a filter of very bibulous paper: the paper became saturated with it; but not a single drop separated. Probably the phenomena of the burly coat have given rise to the idea, before alluded to, in opposi- tion to Hunter, of the comparative lightness of fibrin. The buffy coat appears on the surface of the blood, and therefore seems naturally to suggest the idea. But when the circumstances are inquired into, under which it forms, there is no difficulty in relinquish- ing it. In sizy blood, or that blood which affords a buffy coat, the serum and coagulable lymph appear to be of greater tenuity or less viscid than in blood that is not sizy; and sizy blood is generally slower in coagu- lating than blood that is not sizy, although not uni- versally so. When the former quality alone prevails, the buffy coat which forms is thin; when both quali- ties coexist, the buffy coat is thick, from the greater depth of the subsidence of the heavier red particles. Now, though the fibrin of the buffy coat is of greater specific gravity than the serum,—the liquid mixture of coagulable lymph and of serum,—the liquor san- guinis, as it has recently been called,—is of less spe- c 2

IN CONNEXION WITH RESPIRATION. 145 cold; at 11 o'clock the following morning the tem- perature of the room was only 45°; now on turning the stop-cock of the bent tube, the water rose in it to the extent of about one-eighth of a cubic inch. Twenty-four cubic inches of the mixed arterial and venous blood of the sheep, collected and pre- pared with similar precautions, were divided into two portions of about twelve cubic inches; one was agitated in the double-mouthed bottle with hydrogen after the introduction of a little milk of lime, the other without this addition. The result in each instance was the same; on opening the stop-cock, after the agitation, the water rose a very little in the bent tube,—about one-twentieth of a cubic inch. The results of some of the trials already described on the action of oxygen on venous blood, both pure and mixed with azote, in the form of common air, are very consistent with those just detailed on hy- drogen. Previously to stating some other results in quest of fresh evidence on the same subject, it may be advisable to notice particularly the power which blood possesses of absorbing carbonic acid. From experiments which I made on blood and serum in 1824 and 1828*, I inferred that each is capable of absorbing about an equal volume of this acid gas. I now find that when pure carbonic acid gas is brought in contact with blood or serum over mercury, and moderately agitated under ordinary * Philosophical Transactions for 1824.

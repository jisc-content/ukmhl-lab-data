u\ THE AGENCY OF ATMOSPHERIC 360 of wine, sugar, &c. These circumstances, just related, prove some resemblance between the two kinds of fermentation, in their general phenomena,—in the causes which promote and accelerate, and those which retard and prevent them. The leaven which excites vinous fermentation, closely resembles an animal substance in composition and in many of its properties, and is even analogous to fibrin. Like fibrin, it is capable of undergoing the putrid fermen- tation ;* and the fibrin and muscular fibre act as leaven with sugar and water, and give rise to fer- mentation. Whether the fermentation, thus excited, is similar or not to the ordinary vinous fermentation remains to be shewn. I suspect it is not similar in all its products. Carbonic acid gas is disengaged ; the muscle or fibrin is prevented from putrefying,— and if tainted, is corrected; but, I am not aware that alcohol is formed. In one instance, the sugar, by the fermentation, appeared to be converted into gum, powerfully absorbent of water, — but very slightly soluble in water. It was the result of three or four davs fermentation of a solution of refined sugar in water, excited by a small portion of beef. It appears too, not improbable, that a principle may • It also promotes destructive decomposition in vegetable matters in themselves little prone to change. I remember witnessing this effect in a striking manner in a piece of fine table-linen which was sent to the Mediterranean, with other things, and amongst them a bottle of yeast, which burst on the voyage; the damask was to a considerable extent destroyed, but only where the yeast had come in contact with it.

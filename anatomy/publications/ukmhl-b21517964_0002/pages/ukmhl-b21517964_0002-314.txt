M)2 ACTION OF LIME termediately the small flower leaves, almost colour- less ; the water was greenish, and when evaporated to dryness, yielded a small brownish extract; the leaves were in a pulpy state and disorganized; the smell from the mixture was offensive, not unlike that of clover fermenting. The mixture from which air was not excluded, fermented soon after it was put by ; ten days after, viz. on 27th June, it was noted, that the vegetable matter was rapidly decomposing, with a very offen- sive odour, approaching to that of %the putrid ; that much gas had been disengaged, and a good deal of sediment had collected. Examined on the 2d November 1838, it was found in a state very similar to that last described, bearing marks of advanced decomposition. An experiment similar to that on the mallow leaf and clover, was made with lime and water, on moss and lichen, and with a very similar result. It was commenced on the 23d June, 1836, and terminated on the 1st November, 1838. The moss and lichen retained their form, and bore being shaken in the bottle without falling to pieces. The water had acquired a light greenish hue; the lime a brownish hue ; the water evaporated afforded a small brownish residue, consisting chiefly of lime. I shall mention one experiment more of the same duration, in which clover leaf and flower, and mallow leaf, were put into a bottle covered with hydrate of lime, and the access of air excluded by a cork and

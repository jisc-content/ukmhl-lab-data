170 OBSERVATIONS ON PUS. From the observations which I have made, both these modes of explaining the effect appear to be inadmissible. When I had mixed a little of the fluid part of pus, decanted tolerably clear, with a solution of muriate of ammonia, no change was produced, not the slightest degree of viscidity was imparted; but when some of the opaque part con- taining globules was added, it shortly became viscid. And in confirmation, I may remark, that when vis- cidity is imparted to pus either by the saline solution just mentioned, or of common salt, or of nitre, the quality is not destroyed by dilution; the greater part of the saline matter may be removed by re- peated additions of water, and yet the pus will re- main viscid; and further, that if pus be mixed with a large quantity of water in a tall jar, and the water be decanted after the pus-globules have subsided, and this repeatedly till the liquid part of the purulent fluid is entirely removed, the globules collected on a filter become viscid on admixture with a saline solu- tion, almost as readily as if they had not been so treated, and not in an inferior degree. Dr. Pearson makes a statement apparently contrary to what I have advanced; he says, if the purulent fluid rendered viscid by a strong solution of muriate of ammonia be agitated in cold water, "the matters are diffused, and on standing, the pus is precipitated in its original state;" and also, that viscidity is not imparted by a dilute solution of the salt. In answer to this, I shall notice the appearances I have observed

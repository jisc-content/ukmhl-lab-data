170 EXPERIMENTS ON THE BLOOD thermometer was still 49°. The bottle was briskly shaken for about half a minute ; now, on observing the thermometer, it was found at 50°; the vial was again agitated; there was no further increase of temperature: after ten minutes it had fallen to 49°. I shall relate one experiment more, and that on arterial blood. It was made on the 14th of Feb- ruary, and in the same manner as those on the venous blood. Before and after the introduction of the oxygen, the blood, which was from the carotid artery of the sheep, was 45°; after agitation with oxygen it rose to 45*5: this was done when the temperature of the air was 39°.* In a former part of this paper I proposed to recur to the question, Is the fixation of oxygen in the blood attended with the formation of carbonic acid gas? The change of colour accompanying the fixation of oxygen by the blood, so different from that produced by carbonic acid, and the effect of * Sir Charles Scudamore, in his Essay on the Blood, at page 59, states that venous blood cools much more slowly in oxygen gas than in atmospheric air; that the same blood divided into two cupping glasses " after an interval of eight minutes from the beginning of the experiment," exhibited a difference of eight degrees,—that exposed to oxygen being 85°, that to atmospherical air 77°. As in this instance, the surface of the blood only was exposed and there was no agitation,—the effect described could not have been from the ab- sorption of oxygen;—an appreciable portion of oxygen could not have been absorbed in so short a time. How it was accomplished (the retarded cooling) I shall not attempt to explain; I apprehend there must have been some mistake, or fallacy, either in observing or recording the result.

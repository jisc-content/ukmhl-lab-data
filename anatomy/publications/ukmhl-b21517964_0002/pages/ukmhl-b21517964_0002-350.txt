338 ON THE AGENCY OF ATMOSPHERIC bonic acid gas, is there not good reason to infer, that it was entirely owing to the absorption of car- bonic acid gas formed, especially as the moisture of the part or the fluid which it contained was suffi- cient to account for it, and the oxygen which dis- appeared was equal to the absorption added to the carbonic acid gas remaining? In corroboration of this view, I may mention the difference of results obtained, when animal substances were exposed to putrefaction under increased, and under diminished pressure by means of a column of mercury acting on the air, in which the substances were confined,—in one instance, in the closed end of a tube bent up- wards ; in the other, in the closed end of a straight tube, both of course placed perpendicularly. When the pressure had been increased by the weight of eight inches of mercury, and diminished by a coun- terpoise of sixteen inches, the results were well marked, especially when using very putrescible sub- stances, as the fibrin of the blood and muscular fibre. With the increased pressure, at a tempera- ture of about 76°, fibrin being used, in twenty-four hours there was a small diminution of volume of the air, with just sensible marks of putrefaction having begun; whilst with the diminished pressure, there was a small increase of volume and a manifest ap- pearance of putrefaction having commenced. Now, it follows of course, that the carbonic acid gas first formed, would be more powerfully absorbed, and retained with the increased than with the diminished

44(3 ON THE MALE ORGANS OF SOME along the spine close to the bladder,—it occurred to me, as possible, although not probable, that this cavity might be a channel of communication be- tween the testis and the cloaca. To endeavour to determine this, a small opening was made into the cavity, and it was forcibly distended with air by means of the blow-pipe; but no orifice inferiorly could be detected; the air was completely confined. This done,—the fluid contents of the different parts were subjected to microscopical examination, in the following order,—first, that of the urinary bladder; secondly, that of the milt-like testis; thirdly, that of the globular testis ; and lastly, that of the vas deferens. The results in part were somewhat different. The fluid contained in the two urinary bladders amounted to four-fifths of a cubic inch ; like the former, it was colourless and transparent with a very slight sediment; it contained a few globules, but no animalcules. The milt-like part of the testis yielded but little fluid: a minute quantity of it collected by scraping an incised surface, under the microscope exhibited no animalcules,—but many well defined globular particles of different sizes com- monly smaller than pus-globules, and a few blood- corpuscles. The globular portion of the testis abounded in fluid, of a creamy appearance, con- taining many animalcules, mixed with globular par- ticles; the former precisely similar to those ob- served in the first instance, and like them motion- less. The fluid of the vasa deferentia, which flowed

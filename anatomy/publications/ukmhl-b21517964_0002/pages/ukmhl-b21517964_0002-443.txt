AND ON THE FLOW OF THE BILE. 431 In the examination of bodies, I am not aware that chyme has ever been found in the ductus com- munis choledochus ; I have never seen it there. And from what I have observed, I am disposed to believe, that the bile, after death, rarely if ever descends into the intestine, but is retained in the gall bladder and ducts above the entrance of the common duct between the coats of the intestine. This I infer from finding the penetrating portion of duct, not stained with bile, like the portion above, and therefore it may be presumed not containing bile.* I mention these circumstances in proof that the structure of the terminal portion of the duct is such as to act in the manner above-mentioned. Besides the valvular processes described, several circumstances without doubt are involved in the operation,â€”as the common duct, previous to enter- ing the intestine being enveloped in, or attached to a portion of the pancreas ; its oblique passage through the coats of the intestine ; the diminution of its diameter there ; and its clitoris-like papilla, protected by a fold of the villous coat of the duode- num, somewhat resembling a prepuce, as has been pointed out and described by Morgagni :| and in relation to the gall bladder, in addition to some of these circumstances, its position, partly protected * This portion of the common duct, may be considered in function analogous to the rectum, commonly empty and collapsed, and dis- tended only just before, and in the aet of evacuation. t Epist.

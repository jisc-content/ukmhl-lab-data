172 EXPERIMENTS ON THE BLOOD ject of experiment in each. The one killed by strangulation died in about a minute after a cord had been drawn tightly round its neck; the other, placed on the plate of the air-pump and confined by a receiver just large enough to hold it, lived about five minutes after the exhaustion had been com- menced, the pump the whole time having been worked rapidly. The bodies were immediately ex- amined. The heart of the strangled animal was motionless; it was distended with dark blood; twelve measures of the blood, broken up and agi- tated with twenty-nine of carbonic acid gas, ab- sorbed eighteen measures, or 150 per cent. The heart of the other guinea pig was also distended with blood, but of a less dark hue. Its auricles were feebly acting; the lungs were paler than in the former and more collapsed: ten measures of blood from the heart, broken up and agitated with fifty of carbonic acid gas, absorbed thirty-seven measures, or 370 per cent.! Further, in illustration of this supposed secreting power of the lungs, I might adduce the condition of the blood in disease, and in instances in which I have examined it after death from disease, in the majority of which I have found the blood loaded with carbonic acid, as indicated both by the disen- gagement of this gas, when the blood was agitated with another gas, and by the comparatively small proportion of carbonic acid which the blood was capable of absorbing. This condition of the blood,

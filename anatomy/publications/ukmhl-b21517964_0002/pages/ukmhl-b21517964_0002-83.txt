71 ON THE BLOOD. I shall give it in detail, from my notes taken at the time, on account of the interesting nature of the subject. During a violent thunder-storm at Malta on the 15th of November, 1832, a Maltese labourer, aged 65, previously in good health, was struck dead by lightning. The body was conveyed to the Civil Hospital, where I had an opportunity of examining it twenty-four hours after the event. The hair on the left side of the chest was slightly singed. The cutaneous vessels generally were very much distended with blood ; the face and neck were purplish red; the inferior surfaces purplish. The fingers were contracted and rigid. The abdomen was very much distended, tense and tympanitic. There was froth at the mouth, mixed apparently with some of the discharged contents of the stomach. On inspecting the abdomen, the stomach and intestines were found enormously distended with air. There was much air in the cellular structure from putrefaction; the cellular structure even in which the gall bladder is embedded in the liver, was distended with air. There was a general staining of the different structures by the blood, and the blood-vessels, and the lining membrane of the heart and bronchia was dyed dark-red. There was frothy blood in the veins, and in the right cavities of the heart with a little soft coagulum. The lungs were very red and distended with air, and its vessels were strongly stained.

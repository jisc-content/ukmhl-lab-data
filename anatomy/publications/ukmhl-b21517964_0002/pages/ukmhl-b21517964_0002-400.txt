388 ON MACERATION IN WATER OF the dura mater; but rather more slowly in the early part of the process, and more rapidly in the latter, and without discoloration. Maceration, I may remark, afforded no evidence of its being a compound tex- ture, consisting of an outer fibrous, and inner serous membrane, of different characters, as Bichat considered it. That it is a fibrous or fibrocel- lular structure capable of secreting serum, seems certain; but more than this at present appears hypothetical, and deficient in anatomical demon- stration. Cuticle, (4. 10.)—It became detached from the cutis in from ten to thirteen days, and from some parts sooner than from others. It very slowly un- derwent change. It became discoloured, generally brownish ; in one instance partially blue. A slimy matter formed on it attended with softening; and it gradually fell to powder or small shreds. These changes were best observed in the thick cuticle of the sole of the foot, in which instance they occurred in about twelve months. Cutis, (4. 7- 9. 10.)—The cutis of different parts underwent change somewhat differently. The dif- ference was most remarkable in the very thin cutis, and in the thick; as in the cutis of eyelids, prepuce and scrotum, and in that round the anus, the chin, the abdomen, &c. The very thin cutis resisted change for a long time ; the subjacent cellular tissue became distended with water, and then it was extremely difficult to say where this tissue terminated, where

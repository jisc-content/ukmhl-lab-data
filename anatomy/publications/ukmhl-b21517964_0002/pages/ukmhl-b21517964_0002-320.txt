308 EFFECTS OF TANNIN ON THE it rose to the surface, in the form of a thick pellicle, having undergone some change. The animal parts which seemed to suffer most from putrefaction, were the liver, spleen, pancreas, and kidney. The cuticle was the only part that did not appear to combine in the smallest propor- tion with tannin, or to be preserved by it. After long immersion in the infusion, it was as it were rotten, the particles of it hardly held together, and were most easily detached, and, when dried, their cohesion was almost entirely destroyed. This, how- ever, strictly applies only to the outer layer, not to the inner, and there appeared to be a gradation from it. The nearer it approached the cutis the more coloured it had become and compact, and the more it seemed to partake of the nature of this membrane, when converted into leather. All the other parts were more or less indurated, and ren- dered more compact and firm, and all of them were more or less coloured. When dried, they were all comparatively rigid, with the exception of the pleura and pia mater. When immersed in water, they imparted to the water a brown colour. The colour- ing matter thus withdrawn when exposed to the air, was gradually precipitated, and became insolu- ble like vegetable extractive, and when burnt, it emitted a mixed fume of vegetable and animal matter, â€” the former predominating; and, by its abstraction, though the colour of the different tex- tures was very little altered, yet they were all ren-

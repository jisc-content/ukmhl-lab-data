IN CONNEXION WITH RESPIRATION. 137 healthy animal, have been decisive and consistent. In every instance, whether atmospheric air or oxygen was used, after agitation, there was a marked dimi- nution of the volume of air. In the examples which it may be advisable to bring forward, I shall confine myself to a few of the experiments I have made on the blood of the sheep. Using the graduated tube over mercury, sixty-two * measures of arterial blood from the carotid artery, agitated with thirty-three measures of common air, produced a diminution of two measures; and sixty- three of the same arterial blood, agitated with thir- teen of pure oxygen, a diminution of three; whilst sixty-three of venous blood from the jugular vein of the same animal, agitated with thirty-three of com- mon air, produced a diminution of six ; and seventy of this blood, with thirteen of oxygen, a diminution of eight.* In experiments on a larger scale, using the double- mouthed bottle, in which about ten cubic inches of blood were agitated with about twenty-two cubic inches of air, the results were in accordance with the preceding. Thus, when the arterial blood of the sheep was agitated with common air and with oxygen, on turning the stop-cock of the bent tube there was * Notwithstanding the frothing attending the agitation of blood in air, the absorption or diminution of volume was ascertained with tolerable accuracy by observing the rise of the mercury in the tube. The experiments were made as nearly as possible under ordinary atmospheric pressure, which was easily effected, as the mercurial pneumatic trough used exceeded in depth the length of the tube.

353 AIR ON DEAD ANIMAL MATTER. by the difference of the specific gravities of the two fluids,â€”it may be inferred that the perpendicular position of the larvae is maintained, whilst probably by the action of one on the other, a compound is formed fit for assimilation and for forming a part of the new animal, the putrefactive process at the same time being accelerated. It appeared probable at first view, that the larva? themselves might generate and possess a comparatively high temperature ; but, un the whole, the observations which I made to endeavour to determine this point, are not in favour of the notion. When the larvae are distended with putrid matter, exhaling ammonia and rapidly under- going change, then their temperature, as might be expected, is always above that of the atmosphere; but, when they are free from putrid matter inter- nally and externally, although collected together in a large number, in a small space, as in a phial, a delicate thermometer placed in the midst of them, did not indicate the generation of any sensible de- gree of heat. And, in conformity with this, I found that the larvae by themselves vitiated the air very slowly; indeed, I believe that their dead bodies vitiate it more rapidly than their living. The changes in the dead bodies, in putrefying and becoming semi-fluid, accompanied by the formation of car- bonic acid and ammonia, are more rapid than the changes in their living bodies in passing from the larvae through the chrysalis state to that of the imago, or in becoming as it were solid, which change VOL.

471 OBSERVATIONS ON PUS. in making an experiment, to test the value of his remark. A strong solution of muriate of ammonia was diluted with rather more than an equal volume of water, into which, so diluted, a little pus of an abscess was poured, and they were mixed by agita- tion. The mixture was of a light greyish hue, trans- lucent and equable; the globules shewed no dispo- sition to subside, marking a slight degree of viscidity, and which, on trying it with a probe, it was found to possess. It was now thrown into a large quantity of water, by which its viscid property became very con- spicuous. It immediately sunk, and did not mix with the water, keeping together in a mass like the glairy white of an egg, similarly treated, or like mucus, which, under water, it greatly resembled; and the resemblance was more striking from fila- ments being raised from the general mass, by minute air bubbles disengaged and suspended in the viscid matter. As the concentrated solution of muriate of am- monia and the other neutral salts, in my experi- ments, have not rendered the fluid of pus viscid; as they do not render serum viscid, and there ap- pears to be no necessary relation between concen- tration and viscidity, the conclusion I have come to, and which has been confirmed by all I have witnessed, is, that the effect of viscidity is equally independent of inspissation, and coagulation, and is produced on the globules themselves, which in fact are the part which exhibit it. In accordance with

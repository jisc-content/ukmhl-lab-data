THE ACE OF MORBID ADHESIONS | 244 * 3 grs. of the salt were dissolved in 12 ounces of water. ounces of blood were allowed to escape, and then twelve ounces of the solution* were injected in the direction of the heart, and ligatures immediately applied to the vessel. The post-mortem examina- tion was made on the following day, the 23d Sep- tember, twenty-three hours after death. to be detected for the space of 33 hours. The following is a copy of the notes made at the time:— June Vm, 1833. xii. 40, took the salt. 42, no effect on urine. 48, ditto. 55, very slight bluish tinge. 1*5 slight blue. 15, blue, v. 0, ditto. vii. 0, ditto. x. 30, slight blue. June 13. viii. slight blue. i. p.m. ditto. ii. faint bluish tinge, x. very faint. June 14. viii. a.m. no perceptible bluish tinge. I find it remarked, that almost all the urine voided during the 33 hours that the salt was appreciable, was tested,—and that the quan- tity of iron thrown down was very small, conveying the idea that only a small portion of the triple-prussiate reached the bladder,— and giving rise to the conjecture that the greater part of it was de- composed in the system. I may add by way of precaution,—that the day after taking the very large dose of the triple prussiate, I felt unwell,—experiencing slight vertigo and tendency to syncope.

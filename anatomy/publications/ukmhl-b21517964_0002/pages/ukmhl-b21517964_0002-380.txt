ON THE AGENCY OF ATMOSPHERIC 368 that it either arose from the ordinary sources of animal heat being more energetic than usual, or from the cooling process being comparatively ineffi- cient, or else to imagine some peculiar morbid change in the blood itself, on which, in common with the disappearance of the fibrin, the unusual temperature may have depended. In all the in- stances recorded in the preceding pages, in which, during putrefaction there was a considerable eleva- tion of temperature, it was at a particular period of the process, namely, when it was most active, when the greatest apparent change occurred, before the oxygen of the atmospheric air had disappeared, and when the change was attended with the formation of carbonic acid gas, partly at least, by the union of the oxygen of the air, with the carbon of the putre- fying matter. Whether any heat was produced during the after part of the process, when the changes were taking place more slowly, when oxygen was excluded, and carbonic acid gas was formed from its elements in the compound in the same manner as ammonia was formed, may be matter of question. The results themselves were far from conclusive,â€”rather hostile than favourable to the idea of heat being thus generated. The analogy of vinous fermentation, in which there is a manifest elevation of temperature produced by the arrange- ments of the elements in new combinations, inde- pendent of the presence of oxygen, may be adduced in support of the notion. Were the proportion of

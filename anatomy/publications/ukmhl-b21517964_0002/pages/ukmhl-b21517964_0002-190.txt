178 EXPERIMENTS ON THE HLOOD ately the form of the blood corpuscles (this is the result of all my trials); but to separate them from each other and prevent their coalescing.* And, may it not be to this circumstance, that in relation to colour, they owe their apparent brightening agency ? We know, that the more concentrated colouring matter is, the darker is its hue ; that the more diffused the coloured particles are, and the more mixed with white particles ; or the purer the white ground is, on which they are spread, so much lighter and brighter is the effect. The great masters of colour- ing of the 16th century practised their art, it is understood, on these simple principles ; using always transparent colours, and never black, and so imitat- ing the rich mellow, and as it were living colours of natural bodies, amongst which black is almost en- tirely confined to coal and charcoal.f I shall give in detail a few observations in support of the preceding statement. In each trial which I shall mention, the cruor of blood was used, that is, blood deprived of its fibrin, prepared in the manner already described. * It is well known, that when a drop of cruor (serum with blood- particles suspended in it) taken from crassamentum, recently formed, is placed under the microscope, the particles collect together in groups and coalesce by their broad surfaces, forming little piles, or rouleaux—and this both in the instance of venous and arterial blood— which coalescence (the one alluded to above) is prevented by a saline solution. t These remarks are applicable to hematosine, which is appa- rently black only in mass; in powder, or seen in small pieces by transmitted light, it is red.

TEXTURES OF THE HUMAN BODY. 309 dered more brittle, even the pleura, when dry, lost almost entirely its flexibility. I tried the effect of water in this manner only on the parts employed in the first set of experiments. The loss each part sustained, per cent., when dried on the vapour-bath, was as follows :— No. Part tried. Per ceut. 1 Cuticle of sole of foot 21-8 2 Skin of thumb .... 73 3 Pleura costalis .... 25-0 4 Lower part of ileon 97 5 Upper part of jejunum 9-0 6 Aorta ..... 6-0 7 Muscular part of diaphragm 34 The great loss sustained by the cuticle was pro- bably chiefly in consequence of the tannin and colouring matter which it had merely imbibed, when distended by the infusion like a sponge, being washed out, and from some of its particles having been detached, in consequence of its decayed state already alluded to. None of the parts shewed the least tendency to putrefy, during this immersion in water, though the temperature of the air at the time was high, often above 90°, and they were ex- posed to the air. Considering all the circumstances of these ex- periments, the loss of a portion of animal matter from putrefaction,*—the apparently great increase * I believe the degree of putrefaction and effect produced by it, is in some measure proportional to elevation of temperature, and that

AFTER DEATH. 209 of the body, generally in the common integuments, and in their peculiar capsules. In a considerable number of examples given in the table, cruor was found in the heart more than twenty-four hours after death. This cruor, in producing false appearances of inflam- mation and congestion, would act much in the same manner as liquid blood, and in estimating the pheno- mena which present on dissection, much the same allowance should be made for it,â€”or serious errors will be unavoidable.* From the experiments given in the table, on the agitation in air of the blood collected after death, it would appear that in the greater number of instances, gas was disengaged. In several instances the air thus liberated was tried, and was found to be car- * Dr. Yellowly in his valuable paper entitled " Observations on the Vascular Appearance in the Stomach, which is frequently mistaken for Inflammation of that Organ," published in the Transactions of the Medico-Chirurgical Society for 1813, has forcibly called the attention of medical men to errors such as these above alluded to* His remarks on the stomach are, I apprehend, applicable to every other vascular organ; and I am not aware of any phenomena pointed out by him, that are not referrible to the circumstances spe- cified above. The long time that a portion of blood may remain liquid in the body after death, does not appear to have been known by him; indeed previous to the observations which I have given in proof of it, I believe it had not been even suspected. The false appearances of inflammation described by Dr. Yellowly, are not to be confounded with those, the effects of mere staining: in one instance the vessels merely contain blood, or cruor, as if in- jected, and which may be washed out, leaving the part colourless: in the other instance, the colouring matter is chemically combined with the vessel or texture, and cannot be removed by simple ablution.

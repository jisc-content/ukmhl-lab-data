DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE HUMAN BODY 267 The same remark applies to Avenbrugger's method of diagnosis by percussion, and indeed to every other method of investigation, which directs and fixes the attention,—drawing it away from vague and un- meaning generalities, the bane of knowledge, to precise and significant particulars,—which are its essence,—and which are equally important, whether we have in view, during life, the symptoms of dis- ease by the bed-side of the patient; or, after death, on the dissecting table, the organic changes, the effects of diseased action. The greater portion of the preceding observations, first appeared in print in the 3d volume of the Edin- burgh Medico-Chirurgical Transactions for 1828. Recently, on consulting Professor Burdach's Trea- tise on Physiology, I find that the subject under consideration, has, since that time, been investigated by MM. Schubler and Kapff, who published a work on it, in 1832. Comparing their table of specific gravities of the different textures of the human body, contained in the 8th volume of the treatise on physiology already referred to, — with mine, —■- some of the results are found to agree, others to disagree, as perhaps might be expected, partly from real differences of specific gravity in the same textures in different bodies, which is strongly exemplified in my list,—and partly from the me- thods of operating and the interference of minute and obscure causes of disagreement and error, not easily detected, independent of the two main ones

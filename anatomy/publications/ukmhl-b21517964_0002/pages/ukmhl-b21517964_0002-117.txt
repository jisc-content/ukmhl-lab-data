105 ON THE BLOOD. Nitrate of barytes, mixed with blood in the same quantity, had an effect very similar. Muriate of ammonia: 20 grains of this salt in powder were mixed with an ounce of blood. The blood was immediately darkened. After twenty- four hours, it was of a very dark-red, and viscid like thick bile. No fibrin could be obtained separate, by passing it through a linen filter. It had a strong ammoniacal odour. A portion of it diluted with water coagulated pretty firmly. After six days, in November, at Corfu, the diluted blood became putrid. The portion not diluted was free from putridity, and after this interval coagulated with water as in the first instance. Sesquicarbonate of ammonia: 50 grains of this salt in powder were mixed with three ounces and a half of blood. There was a change of colour as in the preceding, in which the muriate was added. After twenty-four hours, it had separated into two parts, a supernatant orange-yellow fluid, and a viscid dark-red sediment. A portion of each diluted with water coagulated; the former firmest. After three days, in the same place and season, the diluted portion was slightly putrid; whilst that not diluted was unchanged, and retained its power of coagulating when mixed with water. Sesquicarbonate of soda: 50 grains of this salt in powder were mixed with three ounces and a half of blood. The blood immediately became of a brighter red. After twenty-four hours it darkened,

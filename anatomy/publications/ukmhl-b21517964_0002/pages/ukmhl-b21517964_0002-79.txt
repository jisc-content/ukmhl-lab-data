67 ()Â£ THE HLOOl). blood favours its coagulation,* and, conceiving that his experiments prove the fact, he accounts for it on the idea, that agitation accelerates the escape of the carbonic acid gas, which, as he believes, the blood contains, and on the escape of which, he is of opinion the phenomena of coagulation depend. It may appear a most easy matter to determine whether moderate agitation does, or does not ac- celerate the coagulation of the blood, the experiment is so simple, and so easily made; and, yet I must confess I have experienced considerable difficulty in arriving at a conclusion, from the contradictory nature, not of one or two, but of many results. The great difficulty in this inquiry, and in most in- quiries relative to the blood, is, the impossibility of knowing that any two portions of the same fluid are exactly similar. My opinion is, that no two por- tions are, and even that no two drops of this fluid are exactly similarly constituted, or possessed of exactly the same properties; and that the portions of a continuous stream flowing from the arm, were it divided into a hundred, may all be different. The results of experiments first led me to adopt this notion, in which I was confirmed by further ex- periments, and by reflecting on the subject. Not to be tedious, I shall mention only one experiment. Six gallipots of the same size, and a platina cruci- ble of nearly the same size, were filled in succes- sion with venous blood as it flowed from the arm * Oj). cit. p. 40. F 2

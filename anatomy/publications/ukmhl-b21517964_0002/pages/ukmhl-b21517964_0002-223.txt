211 AFTER DEATH. considering it, in the healthiest condition, always in excess, and capable of being liberated from venous blood, and even from arterial, by the physical agencies in play in respiration; whilst others, as already pointed out, take an opposite view, and deny that any free acid exists in the blood, in its healthy normal state, or can be separated from the blood ex- cepting by processes, in which it is formed from its elements. This discrepancy, the inquiry I have men- tioned will probably explain or reconcile. It will eluci- date also, probably, some other obscure points which might be mentioned, especially where it extended to other fluidsâ€”as the urine and bile. I may mention, incidentally, that whenever I have obtained indications of the disengagement of carbonic acid from the blood after death, they have been afforded by the fluids spoken of, in a very limited number of trials, and also by any effused serous fluid, collected at the same time and subjected to the same test. In most of the cases brought forward in the second table, the blood was microscopically ex- amined, using the achromatic object-glass of one- eighth of an inch focal distance, before-mentioned. I shall notice briefly some of the results. The blood-corpuscles were seldom found perfectly uniform either in size or appearance; slight differ- ences were perceptible. In some instances they ap- peared thinner than usual and more expanded; in some, of perfectly regular outline; in others, the discs had an uneven indented margin, and a puckered sur- p 2

318 EFFECTS OF BOILING ON THE Before passing to another part of the subject, I may mention a small number of trials which I made to endeavour to determine, at what temperature, the corrugating power of hot water commences. Dura mater was selected for the experiment. Water of the temperature of 140°, poured on it, had no apparent effect; at 150°, it was doubtful; at 155°, there was a perceptible corrugating effect; at 170°, it was considerable; and, at 212°, the effect was at its maximum. I shall now describe the effects witnessed on dif- ferent textures from the operation of long continued boiling. As a preliminary, the effects of this agency on the principal constituent parts of the blood, or those into which it is resolved, when abstracted, may be mentioned. 1. Some serum of blood was coagulated by im- mersion in boiling water. The coagulum was in- closed in a linen bag and kept in boiling water, over a slow fire, for twenty-four hours. The matter of the coagulum was not in the least softened ; shewed no tendency to become gelatinous; it was firmer and more brittle than when first coagulated, break- ing with a conchoidal fracture. Wiped with blotting paper to remove adhering moisture, it was found to be of specific gravity 1031. This low specific gravity, perhaps, might have been expected, as when the serum was first coagulated by heat, there did not ap- pear to be any condensation ; the vessel which was filled with the serum, was equally filled with the co-

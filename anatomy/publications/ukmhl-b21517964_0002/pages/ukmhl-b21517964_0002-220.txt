208 OBSERVATIONS ON THE BLOOD to sudden and great changes of quality. Relative to the former, take for instance the phlebolite in its different stages of induration, from soft lymph be- coming of cartilaginous firmness and appearance ; the fibrinous layers deposited in an aneurismal sac, resisting change occasionally for years; and fib- rinous concretions which are formed in the large veins, especially in phthisis, which so soon soften, and in part almost liquefy;—how great is the diver- sity,—how difficult, in the present state of our know- ledge, is the explanation. Nor is the liquid cruor, or the blood remaining either in part or altogether liquid after death,— whether for a definite or indefinite time,—without interest and importance, especially as regards patho- logical research, and the distinguishing between the effects of disease and post mortem effects in the in- spection of bodies. As long as the blood is liquid after death, it must necessarily observe the laws to which fluids are subject under similar circumstances; will accumulate in the dependent parts, and where there is least resistance ; and should there be consi- derable pressure exerted from the disengagement of air in the stomach and intestines, it will appear as if injected in the organs removed from such pressure, whether included in unyielding parieties, as the brain, —subject to occupy less volume from greater re- duction of temperature after death, than its solid, and during life cooler case,—or contained in yielding envelopes, as the lungs in the pleura? and other parts

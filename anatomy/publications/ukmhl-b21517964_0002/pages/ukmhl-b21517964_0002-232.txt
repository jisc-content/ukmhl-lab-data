220 ON THE QUESTION, ETC. precautions being taken which I have adverted to, and which troublesome experience has taught me are absolutely necessary to guard against fallacy in the inquiry. I have mentioned as a presumption, that in disease, the human urine may contain carbonic acid. But whether it does in reality I apprehend remains to be proved. Hitherto, in the trials which I have made of this fluid in patients in hospital, I have not detected it. My experiments on it however under the in- fluence of disease, have been limited, not sufficient to allow me to come to any satisfactory conclusion. After death, I have detected it in the urine, the instant it was taken from the bladder; in these cases it may have been generated in the bladder from a change in the urea, which is commonly se- creted to the last, and which, as is well known, in its unpurified state, is peculiarly apt to decompose and produce carbonate of ammonia, which, were any other acid present, would necessarily afford carbonic acid gas. Whether or no azote, or any other gas is ever contained free in the urine, is a question which per- haps cannot at present be answered in a satisfactory manner, and which can be determined only by care- fully conducted experiments specially directed to the investigation of the doubtful points.

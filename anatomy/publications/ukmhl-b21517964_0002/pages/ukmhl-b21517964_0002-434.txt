422 GENERAL REMARKS ON BICHAT's nected with muscles; that of the cheeks, firm and dense, and like the parotid duct very analogous to a line fibrous structure. An examination of the eye, would call forth similar remarks: the transparent cornea is continuous with the opaque sclerotica; the conjunctival lining with the lachrymal ducts; how strongly are they contrasted ! If from man the ex- amination were extended to other animals, the dif- erences presenting in continuous surfaces would be found to be even more striking,—as in the several stomachs of the ruminating animals,—the gizzard of the gallinaceous tribe,—the oesophagus of many of the tribe of cartilaginous fishes. How totally inimical to the doctrine of Bichat, is the second instance alluded to, in which the continuity of mucous mem- brane is entirely interrupted, and its place supplied by a horny lining. M. Magendie, in his excellent notes to Bichat's Treatise on Membranes, has made remarks to the same effect. He remarks admirably on this very subject, " that generalization carried too far creates difficulties. That it is clearly useful to study mucous surfaces as one and the same membrane extended over different organs; but, that when the examina- tion of the structure of the membrane is minutely investigated in detail, marked differences occur. In truth, (he adds) mucous membranes differ essen- tially, according to the organs, and even the parts of organs to which they belong. The mucous lining of the oesophagus, does in nothing resemble it may

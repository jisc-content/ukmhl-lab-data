248 THE AGE OF MORBID ADHESIONS; opening made by removing a portion of the false ribs; the deceased was 26 years of age. The usual inspection was made three hours and half after. The pericardium was carefully laid open; it con- tained about half an ounce of fluid, and by the test before mentioned, it was proved, that a very little of the solution had penetrated into the pericardium and was mixed with it; it acquired a distinct greenish hue. There was a very little fluid in the right pleura; and this on trial afforded proof, by the change of colour, of the saline solution having reached so far. Experiment 4. On the 19th September, an hour and half after death, the consequence of articular suppuration, after an accident, (the deceased was 45 years of age,) opened carefully into the pericardium, avoiding the pleurae ; and introduced about four ounces of the solution. The opening was closed by suture of the integuments. The post mortem examination was made 21 hours after. The left lung contiguous to the pericardium was moist; a few drops only could be collected from its surface. This minute quantity, on the addition of a drop of the ferruginous solu- tion, became dark-green, and on the addition of a drop of nitric acid, dark blue. The blood in the heart was too thick to admit of being tested. All these results incontestibly prove a permeability of the membranes after death, admitting of the exu-

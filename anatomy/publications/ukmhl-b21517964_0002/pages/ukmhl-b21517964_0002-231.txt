If the carbonic acid, when taken into the stomach in large quantity, is not conveyed into the bladder in the fluid which passes off so rapidly by the kid- neys, but is separated from it, either altogether in the prima? via?, or in part in the blood, it seems highly improbable that these organs, ever, excepting when in a diseased state, should separate this gas from the blood; and when the composition of the blood is taken into account, and the state in which the alkali it contains appears to exist in it, — namely, as I have endeavoured to show, in that of sesquicarbonate,—this conclusion is in a great degree strengthened; and it appears to me also much corroborated by keeping in view the peculiar function and structure of the lungs as an exhaling organ acting exposed to rarefied air, and as it were in a partial vacuum, compared with the kidneys, so differently situated and constituted, and having a function to perform so different. The principal difficulty I have experienced in coming to the conclusion which I have been obliged to draw from my own experiments has been to ac- count for M. Brande's opposite results. I can only reconcile them with those which I have obtained, by supposing that he did not give his special attention to the subject; and that the trials he made of the effects of exhaustion were conducted without those

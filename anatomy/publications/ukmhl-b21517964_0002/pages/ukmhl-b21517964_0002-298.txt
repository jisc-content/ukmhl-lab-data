286 ACTION OF CORROSIVE SUBLIMATE The properties too, of the compound appear to me most favourable to the idea which I have advo- cated of its nature. Its properties are strongly marked, and are indicative of energetic union,— being tasteless, insoluble in water, and not decom- posable either by the muriatic acid, or by an alkali, or by lime; whilst it is soluble in an aqueous solu- tion of the former, whether of soda, potash, or of ammonia, and also in a slight degree in the liquid albumen ovi. Dr. Bostock from his experiments, concluded that the compound of albumen and corrosive subli- mate contains from to ith its weight of the latter. From various circumstances, it is difficult to ascer- tain the exact proportions of the two, as he himself has pointed out. The estimate can only be consi- dered as an approximation; I mention it chiefly in application to the preceding results. These results practically considered, are not with- out interest, as confirming the general antiseptic power of corrosive sublimate,—preventing, it would appear, putrefaction from taking place in every in- stance in which it was tried,—arresting it when in progress, and equally arresting vinous fermentation. Mr. Swan, in his " Account of a new method of making dried Anatomical Preparations," published in 1820,—which I have only recently seen,—has shewn how usefully corrosive sublimate may be em- ployed in the dissecting-room. In consequence of its great antiseptic power for the purpose of carrying

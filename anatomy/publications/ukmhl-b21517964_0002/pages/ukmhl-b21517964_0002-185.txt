IN CONNEXION WITH RESPIRATION. 173 in relation to carbonic acid, I believe to be one of great interest and importance, and capable, when further investigated, of throwing light on many ob- scure parts of pathology, and especially on the im- mediate cause of death, and that happy absence of pain in dying which is commonly witnessed. As regards an exhaling power, which I suppose the lungs may possess, I conceive it may be exer- cised occasionally under peculiar circumstances— circumstances, in the first instance, favouring an accumulation of carbonic acid gas in the blood, as undue pressure of any kind, and, in the second in- stance, circumstances of a different nature, con- nected with the removal of undue pressure, ad- mitting thereby the excess to pass off. The view which I have alluded to relative to the production of animal heat, is, I believe, capable of explaining very many particulars of animal tempera- ture in different classes of animals, and both during life, in health, and disease, and in a state of hyber- nation, and after death. If correct, this it must necessarily do, theory being merely an expression of facts, and truths in nature being perfectly consistent. 9.— On the Difference of Colour of Venous and Arterial Blood. Of that difference of colour between venous and arterial blood, which, it appears, was first specially

280 ACTION OF CORROSIVE SUBLIMATE gation which unavoidable circumstances obliged me to leave in a very unfinished state. The two first I shall mention, were of a preliminary kind, to test its power of arresting fermentation and putrefaction. On the 15th August, at a temperature between 80° and 90°, a small quantity of aqueous solution of corrosive sublimate was added to the expressed juice of the grape in brisk fermentation. The fermenta- tion was immediately arrested. The mixture was put by in a bottle loosely corked, not entirely ex- cluding the air. Examined on the 24th February, no further change appeared to have taken place; the liquid was clear, and had the peculiar smell of sweet must, and the sediment seemed unaltered. On the 10th of August a portion of muscle putre- fying was put into a solution of corrosive sublimate. The putrid process was arrested; the peculiar offen- sive odour ceased. It was then washed and sus- pended in water. Examined on the 24th February, it was found unaltered—totally free from any un- pleasant smell., On the 15th of April, portions of different tex- tures, taken from the body of a soldier that had died at the age of 36, were immersed in a satu- rated aqueous solution of corrosive sublimate, after having been gently pressed between folds of filtering paper, and carefully weighed. They were left undisturbed till the 25th May, when they were taken out, examined, and weighed : they were then

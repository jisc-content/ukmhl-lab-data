70 MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS coagulation is distinctly accelerated, having, as it would appear, an effect similar to that of a crystal in a saturated saline solution ready to crystallize; and it has occurred to me that agitation may pro- mote coagulation by producing a more intimate mixture of the particles, of those which are first coagulated, with those which are still liquid; I say "first coagulated," because it may be inferred from what has been already stated, that some particles of lymph are coagulated almost immediately after the blood is drawn, and these may act on the mass like a portion of crassamentum introduced into it. 3.â€” On the Effect of Lightning on the Blood. It is commonly believed that the blood of those killed by lightning does not coagulate. The opinion has been adopted by Hunter,* but on what evidence is not stated. Now, as it appears, that the blood of animals killed by the discharge of an electrical battery is not deprived of its power of coagulating, and as electricity, applied as a chemical agent, seems rather to promote than retard the coagulation of the albuminous contents of the blood, d priori, it does not seem probable that the popular belief is correct. The question, however, cannot be determined ex- cepting by an appeal to facts. The following case, with this view, may be deserving of being recorded ; * Treatise on the Blood, &c. p. 34.

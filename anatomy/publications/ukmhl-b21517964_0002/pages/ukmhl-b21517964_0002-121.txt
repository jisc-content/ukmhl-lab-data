ON THE BLOOD. 109 was like serum. On dilution with water, the fibrin coagulated very slowly, and the coagulum which formed was of very soft consistence. (3).— Of those substances which accelerate coagu- lation, or otherwise alter the blood. ■ The following substances, I find, belong to this class, namely,—the oxalic, tartaric, and citric acids, chlorate of potash, lime, and calomel. No doubt, the number will augment on farther inquiry. I shall notice, briefly, the apparent effects of each. Oxalic acid: fifty grains of this acid, in powder, mixed with two ounces of blood, immediately coagu- lated it; the coagulum was of a pitch colour, and of firm consistence, and no serum separated from it. A smaller proportion of the acid rendered the blood thick. Tartaric acid : thirty grains of this acid, dissolved in two drachms of water, mixed with two ounces of blood, prevented immediate coagulation; after two hours, the mixture became frothy from the disen- gagement of air, thick like tar, dark brown and viscid; after twenty-four hours it had lost its visci- dity, was firmly coagulated, but without contraction and separation of serum, and was easily friable. Citric acid: thirty grains of this acid, with the same quantity of saturated aqueous solution, mixed with two ounces of sheep's blood, slightly retarded its coagulation; in half an hour the blood coagulated. The coagulum was firm and tough, and of a brownish

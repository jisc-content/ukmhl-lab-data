15 ON THE BLOOD. perfectly accord with those of Hewson. I shall give a few of the results. The same glass vessels were employed to collect the blood in as before. The temperature of the air was 68°. In one vessel, the blood which first gushed out, on the division of the great cervical vessels, was caught,—and, in another similar, that which flowed just before the animal expired. 1. On the sheep.—The blood which flowed first, was firmly coagulated in two minutes; but that which flowed last, in half a minute. 2, 3 and 4.—In three experiments on lambs, the results were perfectly similar; the first portion coagu- lated in one minute ; the last in half a minute. It is not easy to reconcile these results, and those of Hewson, with Mr. Hay's. His perhaps may be held as exceptions. The two former at least shew that in certain cases, the blood which flows from an exhausted animal possesses an unusual proclivity to coagulate : and if consequences are attended to, it is difficult to avoid considering it, whatever may be its cause, as a happy provision of nature to aid in arresting hemorrhage. 4.— Observations on the specific gravity of the different parts of the blood,—viz. the serum, coagulable lymph, and red particles. Mr. Hunter, from a few very simple experiments, arrived at the conclusion, that of the different con-

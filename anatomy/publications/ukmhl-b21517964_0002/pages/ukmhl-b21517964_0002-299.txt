ON THE TEXTURES OF THE HUMAN BODY. 287 on minute dissections, and for making dried pre- parations. He employed it in solution in spirits of wine, (2 oz. of the chloride to 16 oz. of spirit of wine) or in water with the addition of muriate of ammonia (2 oz. of the chloride, 70 grains of the muriate and a pint of water). The latter is recom- mended by its cheapness. For the details of Mr. Swan's method, I must refer to his work on the sub- ject, which is very deserving of the notice of the practical anatomist. Corrosive sublimate in solution has also been employed for preserving moist preparations; but hitherto not successfully. In 1823, I saw several preparations preserved by means of it, in the museum of the late Mr. Brooks, and in the col- lection of Mr. Carpue. Mr. Brooks informed me that after steeping for a certain time the preparation in an aqueous solution of the chloride, he trans- ferred it to proof-spirit, covering the jar in the usual manner. All the preparations which he shewed, were more or less injured by a white de- posit encrusting them: and in some instances, the insides of the jars were so encrusted as to have become quite opaque, hiding completely the object within. From some experiments which I then made on two preparations which had there suffered, which he was so good as to entrust to me for examination, — I found the encrusting matter to be chiefly calomel,—whether on the preparation itself, or on the interior of the containing vessel: the latter de-

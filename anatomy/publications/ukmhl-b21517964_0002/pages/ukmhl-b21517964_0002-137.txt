125 ON THE BLOOD. pleurae and lungs, the blood drawn at the commence- ment of the disease is, occasionally, not buffed nor cupped; but, on repeating the operation the follow- ing day, the blood exhibits both these qualities. 4. In cases of inflammation of the mucous coat, whether of the air-passages, or of the alimentary canal, the blood drawn sometimes shows the appear- ances and qualities enumerated, and sometimes not. 5. Experience does not seem to have established, even generally, any relation in point of degree, be- tween these appearances and qualities, and the in- tensity of the inflammation. Sometimes the buffy coat on the blood is very thick, and the crassamen- tum is much contracted, and the symptoms of in- flammation are not violent,â€”and the recovery is not long protracted; and sometimes the reverse of this occurs. 6. In a large proportion of fatal cases, fibrinous concretions, or polypi, as they were formerly called, corresponding to the buffy coat on the blood drawn, are found in the heart and great vessels, and, as well as I can judge from my experience, as often when the lancet has been freely used, or only moderately, or not at all. The consideration of such facts, I must confess, deprives me of confidence in these appearances, as indications for practice and the repetition of blood- letting, and induces me to conclude, that as a criterion in this way, they cannot be pronounced just or safe. Let us next consider the appearances and qualities

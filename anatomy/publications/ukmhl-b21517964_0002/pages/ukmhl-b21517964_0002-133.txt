121 ON THE BLOOD. animals may be frost-bitten, and yet not destroyed. The common medicinal leech may be frozen and kept frozen for a length of time, and yet not killed. In the winter of 1827, I had proof of this, when going, in company with my brother, the late Sir Humphry Davy, from England, through France, into Italy, by Mount Cenis. It may be proper to give some details respecting a fact, which to the best of my knowledge is new. For about a month, the cold was very severe, so much so, that some leeches which were kept inside the carriage in a bottle of water, were included in a solid mass of ice, from London nearly to Modena; and, it must be inferred, were frozen, as the temperature was often below the freezing point, and in passing the Alps, only a few degrees above zero, of Fahrenheit's scale ; notwith- standing, when the ice was gradually thawed, the leeches all, with the exception of one, revived, and after this lived a considerable time.* It may indeed be said, however improbably, all the circumstances considered, that the leeches were * The fact is thus described by my brother, in his Journal: " On the 14th (March, 1837), I made use of two leeches, which bit im- mediately, and performed their office well; yet they had been frozen from January 23d to Feb. 22d, and had been sometimes exposed (as on Mount Cenis) for more than 15 hours to a temperature below 10Â° Fahrenheit. They were thawed very gradually, and appeared dead when first thawed, but recovered in some hours in a warm room. They had all (they were twelve) adhered together in a sort of ball, and were precisely in the centre of the bottle, at the greatest distance from the cooling causes."

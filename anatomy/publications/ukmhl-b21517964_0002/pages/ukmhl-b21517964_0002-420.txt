408 ON MACERATION IN WATER OF brown mucus-like substance, which had formed in small quantity on the surface, was rubbed off, they exhibited their original colour and lustre. The con- necting tissue of the fibres had been either destroyed or rendered very soft, and in consequence the longi- tudinal fibres were easily separated. Tendons, at their origins and insertions, where most mixed with other textures, change more rapidly; but even in these it seems to be rather a disintegration or se- paration of fibres, than a decomposition of them, and amongst the debris tendinous fibres may always be found, on careful examination, little altered; at least so it has happened in my experiments. The change to which tendon is liable, appears to be the same as that noticed under the head of the penis. Synovial Membrane, (4. 10.)—This membrane has lost its firmness like serous membrane, and its surface has become slimy. With the exception of a few tendon-like fibres, or shreds composed of those fibres and cellular tissue, it has disappeared during a course of maceration of about four months; and the fatty appendices have been apparently con- verted into adipocire. Perichondrium and Periosteum. — Both these tissues have undergone change in the same manner, and at the same rate in relation to time, as the dura mater, where they have been detached by dissection from the parts which they enveloped. When they have not been detached, their change has been modified by the influence of the contiguous surface,

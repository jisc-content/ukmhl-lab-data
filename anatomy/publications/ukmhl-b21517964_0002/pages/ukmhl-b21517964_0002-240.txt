228 TRIALS WITH THE AIR-PUMP ON In a state of disease, however, and especially of fatal disease, I believe the presence of carbonic acid in these fluids is not an uncommon occurrence. When treating of the blood after death, T have mentioned that I have frequently obtained indications of this gas in serum effused in excess into the great cavities, by agitating a few ounces of it in the double-mouthed bottle, with twice or thrice its volume of common air. In these cases, the blood, it should be remembered, was found by the same test, to abound more or less in the same acid gas. The source of the carbonic acid, in the instances referred to, and whether besides this gas, any other gas is mixed with it, are undetermined points, and seem to be fit subjects for farther and special inquiry. 4.â€” Of the Humours of the Eye. The internal component parts of the eye being from their nature and situation very suitable for the trials under consideration, I have in three different instances subjected them to the experiment of the air-pump. In each instance, the organ was ex- tracted a few hours after death: a vial bavins been prepared full of water purged of air, the sclerotic coat was partially divided, and the lens and a portion of the aqueous and of the vitreous humour, was received into the water. On one occasion, a small piece of the retina accompanied the lens, and on another, minute portions of the ciliary processes. On

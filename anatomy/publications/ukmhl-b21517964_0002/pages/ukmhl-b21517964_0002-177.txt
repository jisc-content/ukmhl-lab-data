165 IN CONNEXION WITH RESPIRATION. (1) .— On arterial blood. 1. Fifty-three measures of this blood were agitated over mercury with forty-six measures of nitrous gas; there was a diminution of volume of seventeen measures. 2. Fifty-three measures of the same blood (ano- ther portion) were agitated with nine of oxygen; two measures were absorbed. 3. Fifty measures of this blood, so treated with oxygen, were agitated with forty-seven of nitrous gas ; there was a diminution of twenty-two measures. (2) .— On venous blood. 1. Fifty-three measures of this blood were agita- ted with fifty of nitrous gas ; there was a diminution of ten measures. 2. Fifty-three measures (another portion) were agitated with ten of oxygen; five measures were ab- sorbed. 3. Fifty-one measures of blood so treated were agitated with forty-nine of nitrous gas; there was a diminution of seventeen measures. The residual air in each instance was examined and was found to be a mixture of nitrous gas and azote with carbonic acid gas. The azote, it may be presumed, was introduced with the nitrous gas; it was in the same proportion as that which adulterated it, viz., about four per cent. That the residual air was free from carbonic acid was inferred from the

190 IV. OBSERVATIONS ON THE BLOOD AFTER DEATH. For many years past, in the post mortem examina- tions of bodies, I have been in the habit of paying attention to the condition of the blood in the heart and great vessels, especially in relation to coagula- tion ; and latterly, in conjunction with coagulation, to the effects of agitation on the blood in common air, as a test, whether or no it contain carbonic acid gas in excess, admitting of being extricated by this method. I shall first give the general results of my obser- vations, made in Malta, from the year 1828 to 1835, as an example of the variations in the appearances of the blood after death, and of their comparative frequency. For the sake of brevity I shall present them in a tabular form.

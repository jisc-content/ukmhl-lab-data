4'2(.) GENERAL REMARKS ON BICHAT's, ETC. more elaborate -one of Bichat,—not that they are all distinct tissues, each sui generis,—but that they are analogous in composition, and differ rather in degree than in kind, and that their basis is cellular tissue. When their properties are considered, traced, as it were in transition ; and when it is con- sidered how easily animal, and vegetable substances are modified, there is little difficulty in arriving at this conclusion. Starch, it would appear, by some change of molecular arrangement, its chemical com- position remaining unaltered, becomes sugar; the change, as it is well known, is produced artificially by boiling it in water acidulated with sulphuric acid. Tendon by simple coction is converted into gela- tine; and all the other white fibrous and membranous parts by boiling, are more or less similarly changed in their properties, without being altered, as far as has yet been ascertained, in their chemical composition. And, the conclusion, I apprehend is strengthened, by reference to pathology, physiology, and compa- rative anatomy, and especially the last. The test of truth is practical usefulness. No systematic arrangements of membranes or tissues yet promulgated, based on the views of Bichat, can claim this proof; or be considered otherwise than hypothetical. The desideratum now appears to be a careful and unbiassed examination of every dif- ferent animal structure apart as much as possible from hypothetical views, and the application of the inductive method to the results.

461 OF THE CARTILAGINOUS FISHES. I have mentioned, that most of the preceding obser- vations were contained in a paper presented to the Royal Society: that communication was made in De- cember last year. Since then, I have been informed that Professor Muller has relinquished the views which I have combated respecting the male organs of these fishes, and that he has satisfied himself there is a connexion between their testes and epididymides. This he mentions, in a letter to Dr. Smith, dated Berlin, March 11, 1839, in reply to one, in which the results of my inquiries had been brought to his notice. It appears that it was in examining the tor- pedo, he first obtained proof of the connecting tubuli, and was led to alter his opinion ; and that he an- nounced it, in a note, as long ago as 1836 in his Archives of Anatomy and Physiology. Entirely ignorant as I was of these his later researches,â€”the two trains of inquiry may be considered quite inde- pendent ; and as they lead to the same conclusion, they afford strong confirmation to each other. The details of his observations, Professor Muller pro- mises to give in his work on the Myxinoides, illus- trated with figures, by which there can be no doubt, this distinguished inquirer will lay science under fresh obligations.

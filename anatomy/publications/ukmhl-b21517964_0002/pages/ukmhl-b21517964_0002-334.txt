EFFECTS OF BOILING ON THE 322 more friable, but not more transparent, and not in the least gelatinous :* it was much less weakened and altered than muscle. 9. The inner coat too was rendered more friable, more difficult to separate as a continuous membrane, indeed it could be separated only in fine shreds, and it did not appear at all gelatinous. 10. The pleura was rendered soft, rather gelati- nous and a little viscid. 11. The substance of the lung had become firm, compact, very friable, and of a greasy feel. 12. The liver, kidney, and pancreas, were rendered very similar; and their investing membrane had become very like the pleura. 13. The inner coat of the stomach and intestines was very much corrugated ; it had not become in the least gelatinous, but very friable and easily separable from the cellular coat by rubbing. 14. The cellular coat, between the inner and muscular, was rendered very soft, somewhat gelati- nous and viscid: it felt granular, as if it contained mucous glands. 15. The muscular coat had become very friable ; not at all gelatinous; the muscular fibres were very distinct * I have found the effect of long-continued boiling on the sub- stance of the ligamentum nucha? of the ox similar, and also similar on the thick, very elastic middle coat of the aorta, as in the arch, where this structure is most strongly marked in the ox.

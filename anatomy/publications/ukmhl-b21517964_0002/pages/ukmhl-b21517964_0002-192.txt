180 EXPERIMENTS ON THE BLOOD potassa, of hydrocyanic acid and strong acetic acid, the effects on the blood seemed to be very similar; the appearances were much the same, whether viewed with the naked eye or with the microscope; the colouring matter was dissolved, the forms of the discs were changed, and a darkening effect was pro- duced.* Experiment 2. Equal parts of a strong solution of refined sugar and cruor were mixed together. The mixture im- mediately appeared of a brighter hue; at and near the upper surface scarlet; towards the bottom light brick-red. After twenty-four hours, it appeared generally of a scarlet hue, until it was agitated, when the interior and central portion of the mixture was found to be dark. Under the microscope the blood- discs were perceived to be unaltered. The effect of admixture of common salt, of nitre, of muriate of ammonia, of carbonate of potash, was very similar; as viewed with the naked eye and with the micro- scope. After twenty-four hours, in the instance of common salt and nitre, the solution was hardly tinged by the colouring matter of the blood, and the blood- corpuscles remained distinct in form,—near the sur- face, of a vermilion hue,—within of a darker hue. * In all these instances, the solution of the colouring matter, viewed by transmitted light, was rich red, approaching the ruby hue; in particular instances, compared one with another, there were slight differences of colour.

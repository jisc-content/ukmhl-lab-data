Harvey, from the results of his researches came to the conclusion, that the arteries after death, as well as during life, are destitute of air.* This too, was the conclusion of Prochaska; he opened the arteries under water, and could find no air in them.t Amongst very recent inquirers, Professor Burdach is, I believe, peculiar for maintaining an opposite opinion. He says, " Les arteres des cadavres sont * The passages from Harvey bearing on this, are in many re- spects interesting and instructive. Discussing the question which was agitated amongst the ancients, whether the arteries are the channels of air or of blood, he remarks, " Sanguinem in arteriis contineri, et arterias solum sanguinem deferre turn experimento Galeni, turn in arteriotomia, turn in vulneribus manifestum est: cum ab una arteria dissecta, hoc etiam Galenus affirmat, plurimis in locis, unius semihora spatio totam massam sanguinis ab universo corpore, magna et impetuosa profusione exhaustam fore. Experi- mentum Galeni tale est: Si (inquit) funiculo arteriam utrimque ligaveris, et medio rescisso secundum longitudinem, quod inter duas ligaturas in arteria comprehensum erit, nihil prater sanguinem re- peries: et sic probat sanguinem solum continere. Unde etiam similiter nobis ratiocinari licet: si eundem sanguinem, qui venis similiter ligatis, et rescissis inest, inveneris in arteriis (quern admo- dum in mortuis, et aliis animalibus sajpius ego expertus sum) eadem ratione similiter concludere nos possumus, arterias eundem sangui- nem, quern vernc, et nihil prater eundem sanguinem continere."

OF WATER IN DIFFERENT TEXTURES. 277 The proportional quantity of solid and fluid mat- ter, constituting the animal body, is a question to which considerable attention has been paid by phy- siologists ; and it is a problem still unsolved. Ac- cording to some, the proportion of the former to the latter is as one to six; and, according to others, as one to nine. The results of the experiments on desiccation which I have given, including those on blood and serum, may help to furnish accurate no- tions on the subject;â€”to shew, in the first place, how extremely difficult it is to solve the problem rigor- ously, and how impossible it is to solve it generally; and, in the next place, to show that, in the adult at least, the proportion of fluid or of water has been overrated, inasmuch as in the blood itself it does not exceed one-fifth. As my experiments were commenced unconnected with any speculative views, so I shall endeavour to abstain as much as possible from such views, as they are very apt to lead astray, and in no inquiries more than in physiological ones, and pervert the judgment and even the senses. Deductions must be drawn from experiments with great care and hesitation, and not from one or two, but from many results. The con- clusions which may obviously be made from the pre- ceding experiments, it is unnecessary to point out in detail; and any others I would rather abstain from drawing, excepting conjecturally, and for the purpose of leading to farther inquiry. Thus, in the instance of the results of the experiments on the arteries and

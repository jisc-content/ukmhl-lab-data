EFFECTS OF BOILING ON THE 320 the separation of the fibrin, by being pressed through linen cloth, poured into a vial, was immersed in boil- ing water ; the cruor immediately coagulated pretty firmly. The water was kept boiling for 24 hours. The coagulated cruor was rendered softer and more friable than the coagulum of serum; its colour was a dull brick red, which it had after the first impres- sion of the heat. Pressed between folds of blotting paper, it was found of specific gravity 1090. In the following trials, the operation of boiling was carried on uninterruptedly for ten hours. The parts subjected to it were immersed in the water already in ebullition. They were all from a body 21 years of age, at the time of death. It may suffice to state briefly the principal appearances observed in each texture, or in each compound organ, at the end of the operation. 1. Cerebrum.—Both medullary and cineritious matter, seemed rather contracted, was rather harder and more friable, and felt greasy. will be seen how rapidly, at a temperature between 80° and 90°, fibrin partially liquefies in undergoing putrefaction ; but in the fibrinous concretions, when undergoing softening, I have never ob- served any well-marked signs of incipient putrefaction ; the softened matter has never, that I have witnessed, emitted an offensive smell, and when it has been mixed with lime or caustic potash, it has yielded a very slight odour only of the volatile alkali. The soften- ing of the fibrin, in the living vessels, centrically, [as is invariably the case as far as my experience extends,] whilst the surface of the mass is hardened so as to assume the appearance of a sac or inclosing membrane, does not seem to admit of explanation on any known principle: it is an important problem in its pathological relations and deserving of minute inquiry.

DIFFERENT TEXTURES OF THE HUMAN BODY. 389 the cutis commenced; in fact the former passed into the latter, and the latter seemed to be merely the boundary surface of the former, the fibres only more closely compacted than in the loose tissue, and in the instance of the scrotum and the cutis, of the penis, impregnated with brown colouring matter. Maceration being continued, gradually the surface became covered with slimy matter, a softening took place, the cutis became thin in spots, and holes formed; and at the same time the subcutaneous tissue lost its strength, became slimy, its fibres se- parated, and ultimately both the cutis and subjacent tissue were reduced to a sediment of shreds and particles. The thick cutis underwent change more rapidly at first, and slower afterwards. In a short time, as in about a fortnight or three weeks, it became discoloured, of a bright pink or yellow hue, and it exhibited a cribriform structure, very many small holes having formed in it, arranged in a pretty regular manner, penetrating through the cutis. What remained, constituting this cribriform tex- ture was decidedly fibrous. The fibres were more or less coarse and interwoven, and had the colour, lustre, and general appearance of the fibres of ten- dons, or of the dura mater when separated by ma- ceration. This rapid change was most distinct in the cutis of the verge of the anus. It may be re marked generally, that the more the integuments abounded in the channels of hair and in fatty fol- licles, so much the more rapid was this first change

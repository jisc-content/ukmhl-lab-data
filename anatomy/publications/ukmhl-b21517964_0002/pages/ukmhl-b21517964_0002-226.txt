214 V. AN ACCOUNT OF SOME EXPERIMENTS TO ENDEAVOUR TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NO, FREE CARBONIC ACID EXISTS IN THE URINE OF MAN IN HEALTH. M. Proust, many years ago, maintained that the human urine contains carbonic acid; and M. Vogel, and Mr. Brande, have expressed themselves to the same effect. The first mentioned inquirer was of opinion that this acid exists in excess in the secre- tion of the kidneys.â€”" Nos urines (his words are) en sont surchargees."* The last, Mr. Brande, has not adopted this conclusion; his own is, that the quantity is variable ; he says, " When placed under the receiver of an air-pump during exhaustion, the gas escapes, sometimes copiously, but at other times in minute quantities only."f M. Proust drew his inference from the appear- * Annales de Chimie et de Physique, torn. xiv. p. 258. t Manual of Chemistry, vol. iii. p. 192, 2nd edition. Mr. Brande, in the last edition of his work, that of 1838, in mentioning the in- gredients of healthy urine, includes carbonic acid.

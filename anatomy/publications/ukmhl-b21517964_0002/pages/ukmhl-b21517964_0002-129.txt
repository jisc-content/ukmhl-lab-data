117 ON THE BLOOD. points of view, and arguments for and against the vitality of the blood easily adduced. Perhaps it may not be amiss to prosecute it a little farther, nor unin- teresting to those who are fond of such speculative questions. In support of the vitality of the blood, it may be urged, that one of its ingredients—fibrin, or lymph— when effused, often becomes solid in a very short time, and vascular. When vascular and organized, it may be admitted as alive, even by the casuist; and, also, when the vessels are forming in it, and the moment before that event; and so on to the period when it was effused, or prior to that when it formed a part of the circulating fluid : and, if one part of that fluid be allowed to possess life, it would be extraordinary indeed, if the other parts of it were destitute of life. By a similar mode of reasoning, from the changes which take place in the egg, from the formation of the foetus, and the influence of the spermatic fluid—(a fluid derived immediately from the blood)—the same conclusion may be drawn. How difficult to suppose a living fluid a particle derived from a dead fluid,—that that which animates should be itself destitute of life, or be furnished by one without life. In opposition, it may be replied, organization is an effect of life; but the effect or product is not necessarily living, and a part may belong to the living body, and yet be without life.

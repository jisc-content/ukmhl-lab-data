AFTER DEATH. 193 The blood's liquidity in these instances was not a post mortem effect, resulting from putrefaction; this was clearly ascertained. It was owing either to a loss of the natural fibrin or lymph, on which the property of coagulation depends, or such an altera- tion in it, as to deprive the lymph of this quality. In one instance, a few days previous to death, some blood abstracted from the patient, exhibited in rela- tion to coagulability its normal condition. 3. Relative to the condition of the blood noticed in the 4th and 5th column, as either liquidâ€”coagu- lating on exposure, or partly liquid and coagulable, I believe, it depended (whether one or the other), on the time after death, when the post mortem ex- amination was made: I shall have occasion further on, to bring forward examples in illustration of this remark. 4. Of the 164 cases in which the state of the blood was specially noticed, in 105 instances it was found coagulated, the coagulated blood mixed with fibrinous concretions, or coagulated lymph, the ma- terial of the buffy coat; and I believe it was found in the same state in the majority of the 85 cases, in which its condition was not specified. 5. The instances in which the blood was found coagulated and without fibrinous concretions (the coagula soft) were chiefly cases of tubercular phthisis. In the majority of the fatal cases, how- ever, of this disease, fibrinous concretions occurred. 6. In one instance in which the blood was found vol. n. Q

OF THE CARTILAGINOUS FISHES. 457 provided with circular valvulae conniventes, forming a vast number of cells. Both in the ray and thorn- back, and torpedo, they terminate, in what may be considered the urethra of a rudimentary penis,— the end of which projects into the cloaca in the form of a papilla. In the torpedo, which differs from the other two in having no urinary bladders, the sper- matic and urinary ducts terminate near the mouth of the papilla, by separate and very minute orifices. In the thornback and ray, which are possessed of two urinary bladders, these ducts terminate near the fundus of the short urethra, and close to the neck of each bladder, or its opening into the common passage.* These bladders appear to be somewhat analogous to the bifid bladder of frogs and toads, the latter connecting them with the single urinary receptacle of the higher vertebrata. I have expressed the opinion that these organs may perform the double function of vesiculae semi- nales, and of urinary bladders, partly from their situation and connexions, and partly from their con- tents. I have mentioned that in one instance I • Delicate probes passed through the bladder, ureter and vas de- ferens of the common ray and thornback, meet at the bottom of the short urethra—common to both sides; the openings into it are small and contracted; the vas deferens on each side tenninates in it by a projecting papilla, having an oblique direction. I have carefully sought for a termination of these ducts into the bladder itself,—but in vain. I mention this particularly, because a passage in the va- luable Descriptive Catalogue of the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons, would seem to imply such a termination.

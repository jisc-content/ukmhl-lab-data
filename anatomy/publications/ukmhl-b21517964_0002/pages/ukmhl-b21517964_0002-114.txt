102 MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS that blood may be kept liquid or viscid for days, or even weeks, without losing the power of coagulating, and the fibrin of contracting, when properly diluted with water. In the one state, I find it resists putre- faction ; in the other it readily yields to it. I have said, that vinegar, and ammonia, and aqua potassae are exceptions in this class of substances, differing from them in preventing the coagulation of the blood, however carefully diluted with water, and that mag- nesia is apparently an exception also. The vinegar and the aqua ammonia?, and potassae clearly keep liquid, and that permanently, the fibrin of the blood, as well as dissolve the colouring matter of its red particles.* The appearance of magnesia being an exception also, I have found is a deception, and chiefly in consequence of the circumstance, that on dilution the coagulable lymph does not form a glu- tinous mass, but is precipitated in flocculi. From these general remarks, I shall proceed now to particular instances, noticing only those in which the effects were best witnessed. * Strong acetic acid renders blood dark and viscid; in one in- Btance in which a drachm of acid was added to three drachms of calf's blood, the mixture, though viscid, admitted of being poured from one vessel into another. The red particles did not subside; under the microscope, their appearance was distinct, perhaps a little wrinkled at their edges, and perhaps a little expanded. When a drop of this viscid blood was mixed with a drachm of strong acid, from almost black it became of a reddish hue; and the red particles, it may be inferred, were dissolved, as under the microscope thev were no longer perceptible.

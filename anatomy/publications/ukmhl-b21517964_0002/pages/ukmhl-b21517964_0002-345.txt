AIR ON DEAD ANIMAL MATTER. 333 tongue. As soon as the animal was killed in the usual way, its head was removed and brought from the slaughter house. The brain was extracted whilst still warm, and immediately immersed in water, just in sufficient quantity to cover it: it was cooled rapidly by placing the vessel containing it in running water ; and quickly broken up and reduced to the state of an emulsion. In this state, with as little water as possible, it was poured into the double- mouthed bottle of the capacity of 32 cubic inches, provided with stop cocks and a bent tube, as already mentioned, and well shaken in atmospheric air for about two minutes. On turning the stopcock, with the bent tube attached connecting it with water, the water did not rise in the tube,—on the contrary, a few bubbles of air escaped. The result obtained using rather more than a quarter of a pound of the masseter muscles, cut into very small pieces under water, was similar; as it was also, employing the whole of the tongue divided in the same manner. The cerebral emulsion, and also the first-mentioned muscle was allowed to remain in contact with the air in the bottle for nearly twenty-four hours, without further agitation; after which, on turning the stop- cock, there was a slight rise of the water in the tube; but, I apprehend, not more than might be fairly attributed to a change of temperature which had taken place in the air of the room in the interval; a fall, namely, from 55° to 51°. What was the kind of air disengaged, I did not attempt to ascer-

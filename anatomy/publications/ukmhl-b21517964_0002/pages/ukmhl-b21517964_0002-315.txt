303 ON VEGETABLE SUBSTANCES. sealing wax. Examined on the 2d November, 1838, the flower was found brown ; the clover leaves of a very light green; the mallow of a dark green, and all very friable, falling to pieces when touched. The lime was examined, both before and after, for carbonic acid ; it was quite free from it at the commencement of the experiment, as it was also at the conclusion ; it dissolved in an acid without the slightest efferves- cence, and appeared to be quite unaltered. These results appear to me conclusive, that lime does not promote the decomposition of vegetable matter; and, as I have before mentioned, that in- stead of promoting, it arrests its fermentation. The circumstance that no carbonic acid could be detected in the lime after having been in contact with vege- table matter,—both with and without water,—I ap- prehend, may be considered as demonstrative on this point. Whether lime has any solvent power on vegetable matter, apart from the supposed one of exciting fer- mentation, is a distinct question. From what I have witnessed in carrying on these experiments, I infer, that it has, in a slight degree, at least, in com- bination with water. The extract obtained by eva- porating the lime-water, which was in contact with the vegetable matter, was, perhaps, indicative of this, especially in the instance of the saw-dust; as was also the softened state of the leaves and flowers, —falling to pieces on being shaken,—and confirma- tion, perhaps, is afforded in the results of two com-

DIFFERENT TEXTURES OF THE HUMAN BODY. 411 of which appear to be larvae) feeding on the animal matter. In many experiments, the larvae of the common gnat of Malta, has been very abundant and active as a destroying agent, performing in re- lation to change of form of matter, a part in water similar to that performed by the larvae of flies on dead animal substances in the air. 3dly, To the operation of vegetation of those obscure plants, belonging principally to the conferva of the Swed- ish naturalist, and which in my experiments have invariably appeared, if the process has been at all protracted; and commonly either as fibres shooting from the part in straight lines, sometimes an inch in length, or more obscurely, as a fine velvet-like pro- tuberance, or growth resembling a byssus. The former kind has appeared most remarkably on the neurilema, on the cutis of glans penis, on its liga- mentous sheath, on the tunica albuginea, and on the bones, especially the spongy bones. The latter kind has occurred chiefly on the debris of ligamen- tous and fibrous parts. The first, or the chemical causes, must be consi- dered as the main ones; and the second and third only as auxiliary, and in relation to effect, infinitely inferior in activity. The changes chemically pro- duced, I have not yet attempted to investigate with any minuteness. I suspect they are in most re- spects similar to those which occur during putre- faction in the open air, modified in a certain manner by the solvent power of the water, and moreover

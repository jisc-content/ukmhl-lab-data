OTHER SECRETIONS, AND ON SOLID PARTS. 229 exhaustion in each example, the result was similar; no air was disengaged. In the last of the three trials on the eye from different bodies, the contents of one eye were examined three hours after death, and of the other eye the following day, twenty hours later: the result was the same in both. The thermometer during the time, in the room where this body was deposited, was about 58°. I am not aware, that air has ever been observed in the eye during life, or that there is any well-au- thenticated instance of its having been detected in this organ after death, excepting in cases of very advanced putrefaction. 5.— Of the Solid Parts of the Body. It would be tedious to give in detail an account of the experiments which I have instituted in quest of air in the solid parts of the body. It may suffice to state the general result, or rather the impression made by the results on my mind, which is, that no internal organ, in its healthy normal state, contains air capable of being extricated by the removal of atmospheric pressure by the air-pump, excepting those, [the lungs especially] which are designed to be its recipient. In no instance, in which I have tried the substance of the brain, before putrefaction had commenced, has any air been disengaged from it in vacuo,—a central part having been selected, in which there were no obvious vessels, and carefully cut out with a fine sharp

420 GENERAL REMARKS ON BICHAT's manner in which they undergo change and are affected by reagents have a greater resemblance to fibrous membranes than to mucous,—especially the lining membrane of the ureters, of the larynx, of the sinuses. In the frontal sinuses, I have not been able to detach a mucous membrane from the perios- teum ; the periosteum and mucous membrane ap- pear to be one,—the mucus I believe being derived from follicles contained in the tissue of the perios- teum. In the ureters, it appears to me very doubt- ful, that the lining membrane is a mucous mem- brane. In character it appears to be a delicate fibrous tissue: I have never detected mucous folli- cles either in its substance, or beneath it, or mucus in its canal; and I have often carefully sought for both.* It would be easy to multiply instances, of the deficiency of well marked character,—subversive, I apprehend, of the generalization in question. In the scrotum, the cutis vena seems to be merely the boundary of the cellular tissue of the scrotum, ex- ternally ; the one insensibly passes into the other. A similar remark applies to the periosteum of the maxilla?, especially of the inner surface; the mem- brane there covering the bone, seems cellular mem- brane only a little condensed, and differs very little in character, in the instances in which I have ex- amined it, from the contiguous cellular membrane. * In accordance with this it is liable to adhesive inflammation: in two instances I have known the ureter closed by the adhesion of its lining membrane.

IN CONNEXION WITH RESPIRATION. 175 Harvey,* two principal explanations have been offered by Physiologists. By the majority, following Mayow, the bright vermilion hue of arterial blood has been attributed to the influence of the oxygen of the atmospheric air inspired on the darker venous blood, and the formation and separation, either directly or indirectly, of carbonic acid. By Dr. Ste- vens, recently, a totally different view has been taken of the subject. He considers the salts of the serum more concerned in producing the florid hue of arte- rial blood, than oxygen, believing that they impart this colour to the colouring matter, hematosine ; that venous blood acquires its dark colour in the extreme systemic circulation ; and that it loses the dark colour and resumes the florid hue, in its extreme pulmonary course; in the one instance acquiring carbonic acid, in the other losing carbonic acid, in the latter ex- pelled by the attraction of the oxygen inspired.f per poros corporis transpiravit, sanguinem venosum illo privatum obscuriorem et nigriorem illice apparere, rationi pariter consentaneum est."â€”Op. cit. p. 170. * In 1615, it appears, Harvey first publicly taught the doctrine of the circulation of the blood ; he was then set. 37; the discovery was probably made about the time of his return from Italy, in 1602, as he told Boyle, that he derived the first idea of it from considering the use of the valves, to which his attention was probably specially directed whilst studying at Pavia, by Fabricius ab Aquapendente, who claimed for himself the discovery of them in the veins, and sagaciously conjectured their use in the extremities. t The following passage, expressing Dr. Stevens's peculiar views, is from his paper, entitled " Observations on the Theory of Respira- tion," in Phil. Trans, for 1835. " I have said, that black is the natural colour of the colouring

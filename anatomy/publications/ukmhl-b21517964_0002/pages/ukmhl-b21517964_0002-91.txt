ON THE BLOOD. 79 rapid than at 120°, and more rapid than at 100°. It may appear a paradox, that heat above 100° should increase the liquidity of the blood and accelerate its coagulation ; but is it more so than that cold should render it, more thick and viscid, and yet retard or prevent coagulation ? I infer that the effect of heat is such as I have represented it, from observing blood heated to the degree mentioned, and which coagulated more rapidly than blood not so heated, covered with a buffy coat, when the cool blood, slower in coagu- lating, was free from it. The blood is a mysterious fluid ; nothing can with propriety be taken for granted respecting it. Its properties can be ascertained only by exact experiment and unbiassed observation. Every property which it possesses seems to be adapted to admirable ends; and even these pecu- liarities in relation to the effect of the higher as well as the lower degrees of temperature in its coagu- lation, may be considered as such adaptations. The effect of high temperature on coagulation may tend to limit the destructive effect of heat to the surface ; the effect of a temperature of 80° or 90°, which is about the temperature of the skin, may tend to suppress hemorrhage, the consequence of superficial wounds.

60 EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS years of age (according to Mrs. Hewson, he was born in Nov. 1739, and was in partnership with Dr. Hunter in 1768*), Dr. Hunter's knowledge of the nature of coagulable lymph could hardly have been derived from Hewson, and it must be considered either as the result of his own observations, or of observations common to him and his contemporaries, and not claimed by any one in particular, which, on the whole, perhaps, is most probable. Still, however, to Hewson I believe belongs the merit of elaborating the doctrine, and of making precise what was before vague. In mentioning the revival of correct ideas on the subject of the coagulation of the blood, I have alluded to one or two French inquirers, who perhaps may be considered entitled to share in the merit I have attributed to our English physiologists, if not to have anterior and superior claims, particularly those very able and distinguished men, Petit and Senac. They certainly preceded Hewson, in adopt- ing Borelli's view, or the analogous view alluded to, of the nature of coagulation of the blood, as solely depending on a white coagulable part, which they called lymph; but I am not aware that either of them brought forward in support of it any facts, or experimental results more decisive than those of the Italian physiologist; nor do their statements appear to have had any influence on the doctrines of the day, judging from the opinion of Haller, already Biograp.

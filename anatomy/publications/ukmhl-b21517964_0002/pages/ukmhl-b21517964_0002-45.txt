33 ON THE BLOOD. instance loss firmly coagulated than healthy blood. In two instances, the serum of this blood, last drawn, had a milky hue: a common occurrence in this disease, and which I first learned from the Lectures of Dr. Home. The serum of this blood I frequently examined according to Dr. Wollaston's method, but unsuccessfully ; I could never detect in it a particle of saccharine matter: nevertheless, I believe it contained an undue proportion of animal matter: this was indicated by its comparatively high specific gravity. In the last case of diabetes, the depleting plan of treatment was fairly tried: blood was abstracted for some time every other day, and the effect in diminishing the specific gravity of the blood and the serum was well marked. In this case, further, it may be mentioned that some relation appeared between the blood and the urine. The specific gravity of the urine was always greatest in the morning; when it uniformly exceeded 1040, and was once as high as 1051 ; and yet in other re- spects, it then appeared most analogous to healthy urine; it abounded in urea, and contained hardly a trace of saccharine matter. In the evening, on the contrary, when its specific gravity was least, viz. between 1030 and 1040, the urea gave place to saccharine matter: the former could not be de- tected in it; the latter abounded. And, like the urine, the blood in this case was of greater specific gravity in the morning than in the evening. VOL. II. D

They were sent to relieve a post which they found evacuated. Great part of the way, both in coming and going, they were opposed by the enemy, and found the road variously obstructed. Their exertions were extreme; every man of the party, with the exception of the commanding officer, was in the sick-list within the next fortnight, labouring under remittent fever, dysentery, and hepatitis, and a considerable proportion of them died.

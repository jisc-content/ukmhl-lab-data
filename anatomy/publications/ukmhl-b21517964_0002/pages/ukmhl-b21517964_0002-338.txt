EFFECTS OF BOILING ON THE 326 36.* The articular cartilages investing the ends of the bones of the foot were rendered semi-trans- parent; soft, like stiff jelly. 37- The tendons of the foot had become similar; the tendo achillis was also gelatinous, but less com- pletely so; there were whitish portions observable in it, as if from minute vessels. 38. The pancreatic duct was found changed in a manner resembling tendon ; it had become uniformly transparent and gelatinous. 39. The outer coat of the ductus communis choledochus, was rendered very like the corresponding coat of the aorta; its inner coat was less altered ; it had become diaphanous, slightly elastic, and im- perfectly gelatinous. 40. The cutis of body of penis had become soft, gelatinous, and elastic. 41. The tendinous sheath of penis was affected very like dura mater; but was rendered softer; it admitted of separation in layers. 42. The corpus cavernosum and spongiosum had become very friable, slightly elastic, and only slightly diaphanous. No epithelium could be detected, continued from the cuticle of the gland into the * This and the following trials were made on parts of a limb, amputated on account of extensive disease of the knee joint, follow- ing a fall; the patient was 21 years of age. The amputated limb was boiled eight hours. It was curious to see the general disruptive effect. All the bones of the feet were dislocated; the tendons broken; the cuticle almost entirely detached. The toes and meta- tarsal bones were bent downwards.

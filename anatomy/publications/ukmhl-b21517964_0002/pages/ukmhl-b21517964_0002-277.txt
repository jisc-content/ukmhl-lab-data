DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE HUMAN BODY. 265 subjected to the air-pump, its specific gravity ap- peared to be 1070, and after exhaustion, 1119- The instances of bone, in its dry state, and of its calcareous residue after the action of fire, may be considered perhaps as extreme ones,—in relation to the source of error in question, the hollow texture of both being peculiarly well fitted to retain air. The next examples I shall bring forward, may be consi- dered perhaps, as rather average ones,—namely, the ligamentum nucha? of the ox, and the middle coat of the arch of the aorta of the ox. The former, before being subjected to the air-pump, appeared to be of sp. grav. 1130, and after being so sub- jected of sp. grav. 1134;—the latter, in the first instance, of sp. grav. 1073, and in the second of sp. grav. 1077. The substance of the brain may be mentioned as an example of a part not subject to the source of error under consideration, for in vacuo, as has been already stated, no air is disengaged from it; that is, if immersed in water the instant a portion of it has been cut out a few hours after death,—before the putrefactive process has commenced. Relative to the practical use and application of the results, I venture to indulge in the hope that the physiologist will receive them as a contribution to his science, considered as a collection of facts and of rules deduced from facts; and also, that the pathologist, may derive from them a help to the eye, and a more certain criterion of organic change

29 ON THE BLOOD. watery part ? Does it depend on increased activity of the absorbent vessels, in connexion with an undue languor of the terminal secerning arteries ? or solely on the debility of the latter, the action of the former remaining neither diminished nor altered ? It ap- pears to me, that the latter supposition is most pro- bable, and is most accordant with the general doctrines of pathology and therapeutics.* I know not whether the results obtained by Mr. Hay, will bear the same interpretation. He, from his experiments, inferred that the last portions of blood which flowed contain less serum than the first, in the ratio of 28*8 to 55'8.f But his results are defective, inasmuch as he did not determine the specific gravity of the serum, merely the quantity of it which separated in the act of coagulation. The crassamentum of the blood, as already observed, and as is now generally admitted, consists of red particles, serum and fibrin,—the serum contained or held in the interstices of the fibrin as in a sponge; and consequently, the softer the fibrinous mass is, or the less contracted, so much the more serum it must hold. These remarks apply to the deductions of Mr. Hay: the argumen- tum ad absurdum is also applicable to them; for • It maybe owing'to an unusual flow of the contents of lymphatics into the circulation, as the blood flows out: the lymph certainly is of much less specific gravity than the blood,—whether spontaneously coagulable as Hewson found it, in different instances in which he examined it, or only coagulable by heat, as I have occasionally found it in the lymphatic vessels of the spermatic cord of the bull. t Op. cit. p. 28.

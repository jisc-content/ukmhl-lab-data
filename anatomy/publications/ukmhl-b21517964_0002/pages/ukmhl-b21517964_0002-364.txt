352 ON THE AGENCY OF ATMOSPHERIC undergo a similar change, and are ultimately re duced to a liquid poultaceous state, and, as in some of them, there is a small elevation of temperature, may it not be fairly inferred, that the apparently inferior degree of heat generated by them, is merely owing to slowness of change: and, accordingly, whatever accelerates the process of decomposition, seems to promote increase of temperature. Minute mechanical division has this effect in a remarkable manner, as was witnessed in the instance of the fibrin of the blood, and of muscular fibre; the effect is probably owing to the very extensive surface exposed to the action of atmospheric air. The presence of larvae too, has the same effect very strikingly, and probably in the same way. They tend to separate the parts, to agitate the sur- face, and to introduce air beneath the surface. It is curious to watch the progress of these animals in their growth, and still more so in their operations. When their food is very nutritious, the almost microscopic ova, in forty-six hours are converted into large maggots. When they have nearly at- tained their full size, they feed with extraordinary voracity, as if aware that their lives depended upon their activity. The whole of a numerous brood might be observed, side by side erect, with one ex- tremity in the ammoniacal poultaceous mass, pumping up nourishment, and with the other and narrower extremity in the atmosphere, the orifice of its canal dilated, seeming to pump down air; and in the act,

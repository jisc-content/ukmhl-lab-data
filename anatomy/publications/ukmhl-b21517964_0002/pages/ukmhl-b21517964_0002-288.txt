276 EFFECTS OF DESICCATION, AND PROPORTION though in a less degree, and retarding the change.* May it not, too, serve to account for so many remains of ancient Egypt, especially of Upper Egypt and of Nubia, being preserved to the present times, the natural dryness of the climate having been assisted by various processes of art ? And is not proof afforded of the correctness of the explanation, in this region being almost the only one tbus spared and exempted from the general doom of slow and certain change, almost amounting to destruction, which is manifest in other countries, where the ele- ments have free play through the intervention of moisture, even in the works of nature ? Looking over the preceding table of results, it is curious to notice what little relation there is between the solidity of a part, indicated by firmness and re- sistance, and the quantity of solid matter which it yields on desiccation. Who would suppose, a priori, that the soft flexible skin contains more of this solid matter than cartilage ; or, that the delicate serous membranes contain more than the firm viscera; or (and it is most remarkable) that the liquid blood possesses a larger proportion of it than some of the solids ? * The cooling effect of the wind is one of the simplest and most certain means of knowing its proportional humidity. The cooling effect on a thermometer, the bulb of which is wrapped in moist muslin, of the sirocco wind, varies from 3째 to 6째, and of the northerly winds in summer from 12째 to 30째. This is the result of my observa- tions in the Ionian Islands and Malta, and it is applicable, I believe, to the winds named, in the Mediterranean generally.

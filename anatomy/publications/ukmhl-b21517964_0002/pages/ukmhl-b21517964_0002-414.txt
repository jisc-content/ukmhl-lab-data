402 ON MACERATION IN WATER OF much disposed to believe that they are one and the same membrane, with mucous follicles intermixed between their fibres. The membrane lining the tympanum, of such extreme delicacy and vascular, bears a greater resemblance to the pia mater than to either a mucous membrane or ordinary perios- teum,—yet it seems to perform the function of both, though I am not certain that it is provided with any mucous glandules, or moistened with mucus. The membrana tympani appears to be continuous or connected with it; and also continuous, or con- nected with the cuticular lining of the external passage, which is covered with cuticle, and which seems to serve for periosteum to the bony ring of the meatus auditorius. The Eye.—The observations which I have made on this organ and its appendices during maceration, have also been confined to one instance, (No. 10.) and have been more hasty than I could have wished. During maceration, when the cuticle has separated from the eyelids, at the inner boundary of the cilia, I have not been able to detect any, the slightest epithelium, on the conjunctiva. The conjunctiva has undergone change like cellular tissue; the sclerotic coat like dura mater, but more slowly; the cornea has become of a milky appearance, has Gra- dually softened, and has wasted away more rapidly than the sclerotica. The lens has become soft, and like thick mucus; and the change has gradually proceeded from the circumference to the centre;

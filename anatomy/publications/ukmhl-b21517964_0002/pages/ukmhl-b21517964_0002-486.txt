474 OBSERVATIONS ON PUS. great deal, I apprehend, remains to be done, before this can be considered of much importance. The fatty matter, which 1 have obtained from pus has been similar to that described by the author last quoted ; of a butteraceous consistence ; mode- rately firm at 60° ; semifluid at 80°; and liquid at a somewhat higher temperature, according to Dr. Gueterbock at about 140° F., and when pretty strongly heated giving off an ammoniacal smell. Dr. Gueterbock mentions that he could obtain no proof of the presence of cholestrine in it, which recently it has been asserted exists in pus. This substance, he justly remarks, is deposited from hot alcohol in cooling, in the form of crystalline plates : no such plates appeared in any of the processes with alcohol, to which pus was submitted in his experiments; and I have the same remark to make on mine ; thus in- dicating the absence of cholestrine. Probably the fatty matter is a mixture of two or more kinds, one capable of combining with alkalies, and forming a soap ; another not, and so resembling and approx- imating to cholestrine. Dr. Gueterbock appears to be of opinion, that the fatty matter of pus, is free adipose matter mixed with the purulent fluid, inasmuch as adipose globules may be occasionally detected in it with the microscope, and the paper used in filtering pus is rendered slightly translucent. This conclusion does not appear to me very pro- bable, or well supported ; it seems to me more likely, that the fatty matter belongs essentially to pus.

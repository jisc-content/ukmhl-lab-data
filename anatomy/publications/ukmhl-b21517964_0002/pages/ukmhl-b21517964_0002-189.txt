177 IN CONNEXION WITH RESPIRATION. Certain agents, as it is well known, darken the blood, whether venous or arterial, such as most of the acids, the fixed alkalies, and ammonia in aqueous solution, and water itself. In every instance in which I have examined blood so darkened, I have found more or less of the colouring matter dissolved, and the form of the blood-particles, as ascertained by the microscope, more or less altered; commonly, greatly reduced in size, and from discs commonly converted into globules. Certain other agents have a contrary effect, and, on immediate admixture, apparently brighten the blood. Amongst the insoluble, or slightly soluble substances, may be mentioned, magnesia and its carbonate, white oxide of arsenic, boracic acid, viz. the hydrate in its crystalline form. Amongst the soluble substances may be specified those well-known ones, the neutral salts, common salt, the carbonated alka- lies, sugar. The first class do not appear to produce any change in the blood-corpuscles; I have not been able to detect any. Probably the effect is owing partly to the introduction of air mechanically en- tangled ; partly to the separating of the blood-par- ticles also mechanically; and partly to the white particles of the substances reflecting the colour of the blood-particles interspersed. The second class,â€”(for instance, mixed with the blood in concentrated aqueous solution,) do not appear, more than the preceding, to alter immedi- VOL. II. N

334 ON THE AGENCY OF ATMOSPHERIC tain. It might have been common air, expelled, owing to expansion from perhaps a little heat pro- duced by the friction of agitation. Be this as it may, the quantity expelled was so very small, that the determining of its nature, would have been at- tended with extreme difficulty. As regards the conclusion to be drawn from these experiments, the same I apprehend may be admitted as in the instance of serum; viz., that neither muscle nor the cerebral substance perfectly fresh, have the power of obsorbing oxygen in an appreciable quan- tity ; and judging analogically, it may be inferred, at least as highly probable, that the other textures less prone to change, are also destitute of this power. 2.— On the Exposure of dead Animal Matter to Atmospheric Air, at rest in Confinement. As bearing on the subject of putrefaction, as well as in part on the last, in relation to the animal textures,—I shall give the particulars of many ex- periments made at Malta during the summer season, on the exposure of dead animal matter to measured quantities of atmospheric air, confined in jars over mercury at a temperature between 80° and 90°, a heat at which animal matter, as is well known, is peculiarly liable to change and become putrid. I shall first notice the results obtained, using blood and its principal constituent parts, physiologically considered.

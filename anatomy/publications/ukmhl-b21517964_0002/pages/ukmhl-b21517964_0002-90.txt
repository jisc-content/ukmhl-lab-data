MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS 78 room at 65°, and to have observed it eighteen hours after, it is not improbable, that the fibrin might have been in part reduced to the liquid state from putrefaction. Be this as it may, negative results must almost always be considered of inferior value and force than positive; and if exceptions are to be made, commonly there is more propriety in selecting, for this purpose, the former than the latter. Admitting the accuracy of the above, it is pro- bable, that blood may be frozen for any length of time, without losing its power of coagulating, and without losing its power of becoming liquid; a happy circumstance, in relation to the animal economy in these regions, in which the cold of winter is severe, and exposed parts of the body are liable to be frost-bitten; and perhaps equally so, I may remark farther, is the circumstance of the fluidity of the blood being diminished by cold in relation to animals which hibernate during several months of the year in a state of torpor, in which life is barely maintained. From the experiments which I have made on the effect of a high degree of temperature, as 120° ; of a moderate degree, as 100° ; and of degrees between this and the freezing point, I am disposed to infer that the first immediately renders the blood more liquid, and accelerates its coagulation; that the second rather retards than accelerates coagu- lation ; and that at 80° or 90°, its coagulation is less

336 ON THE AGENCY OF ATMOSPHERIC The air over serum of blood confined over mer- cury in the same manner, remained many days without undergoing any change of volume; and so long, the serum retained its transparency. At length a turbidness appeared in it,—putrefaction had commenced, and the volume of air diminished, owing to the absorption of carbonic acid gas which had formed. When the serum was saturated with carbonic acid gas,—the putrefactive process con- tinuing, the volume of air slowly increased. Results very similar were obtained, with the colouring matter alone; or (which is more correct) the mixture of serum and red particles, obtained by pressing the crassamentum gently in linen. The changes in this instance were much the same as in the preceding; they took place more slowly than when blood with all its ingredients was employed, and less slowly than when the serum of blood was used. The changes exhibited by the fibrin of the blood were the most rapid of all. In less than twelve hours, it lost its firmness ; a small diminution of the volume of air had taken place; a little carbonic acid gas was found in the residual air, and oxygen had disappeared about equal in volume to the loss to differ. At a low temperature, as between 40° and 45°, in many instances, I have found both the blood of man, of the sheep, and of the ox, to decompose without evolving any air: there was a conti- nued absorption of oxygen, and the formation of a large quantity of carbonate of ammonia.

DIFFERENT TEXTURES OF THE HUMAN BODY. 3<>5 went changes very similar to those of the stomach, but rather more slowly. On the thirty-sixth day, in one instance, the surface of the mucous coat of the jejunum exfoliated in soft brown laminae, and left exposed a fresh surface in which vessels and fibres might be seen, presenting a very delicate appearance, derived from the submucous tissue, and terminating seemingly in the mucous or inner coat, in the form of loops, especially in the valvulse conniventes, where this configuration was most distinctly displayed, and forcibly gave the idea, that the mucous coat is chiefly formed of vessels, ramifying from and into the sub- mucous cellular tissue. Large Intestines, (3. 8.)â€”The changes which they experienced were also of the same kind, but were even slower in taking place. The submucous cellular tissue, especially of the rectum, where it is very thick, retained its form, and considerable strength, after two months' maceration. The mu- cous membrane within the verge of the anus, like the skin at the line of junction, changed more ra- pidly than the contiguous part of either texture; and in about twenty-one days, in the cool season, when the cuticle was in the act of separation, the softening process had even then commenced. Minute cavities formed both in the mucous coat and in the cutis, which increasing in number and extent, in about a month nearly effected a separation of the two membranes. This greater tendency to decom- pose in this place of junction, I am disposed to attri-

74 MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS my inquiries has been very similar. From what I have been able to learn from sportsmen, and espe- cially from some of my professional friends, familiar with field-sports, coagulated blood is commonly to be found in the hearts of animals thus killed ; and I am authorized by an observer, on whose accuracy I have perfect reliance, viz. Dr. Andrew Smith, to state, that this is the result of his experience in Southern Africa, where the larger antelopes are frequently run down by dogs. Perhaps, in this in- stance, as well as in that of death from lightning, when a loose or liquid state of the blood has been observed, putrefaction has been more concerned in producing it, than the mode of death. 5.— On the Effect of Change of Temperature on the Coagulation of the Blood. It is agreed by all those who have made experi- ments on the subject, that cold, instead of being the cause of the coagulation of the blood, as was for a long time believed after Aristotle,* actually retards * Aristotle, speaking of the coagulation of the blood, in connexion with its cause, says, " Si fibras detraxeris, sanguis non cogetur. TJt enim si ex luto terrenam portionem semoveris, aqua non concrescit; ita sanguis, fibris detractis, incongelabilis manet: fibrarum enim ter- rena est. Quod si non eximantur, cogitur, ut terra humida, frigore. Cum enim calor exprimitur, humor circa trahitur, atque evaporatur : atque ita concrescit, non a calore siccescens, sed k frigore."—De Part. Animal, lib. ii. ch. 4. Harvey, as appears from the passage already quoted, refers the coagulation of the blood, to an escape of the native animal heat; and Sydenham to the cold of the atmosphere.

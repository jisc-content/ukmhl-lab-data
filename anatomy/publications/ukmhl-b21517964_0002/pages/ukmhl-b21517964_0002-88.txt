MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS 76 placed it in the freezing mixture. The blood was frozen in a few seconds. After three or four minutes it was taken out of the mixture ; it pre- sently became liquid. It was again replaced and refrozen. It was once more taken out, and it melted again ; and it was again speedily replaced. At the end of four or five hours, left in ice thawing, and which was then thawed, I found it coagulated. Some of the same blood, not cooled artificially, coagulated in less than a minute; and in less than three minutes, when received into a platina crucible, and suddenly cooled by ice, to 40°. The subject of the next experiment was venous blood, from a soldier labouring under a slight ailment. About an ounce of this blood, received into a glass tube, was instantly put into a freezing mixture. After about ten minutes, a thermometer introduced into the blood fell to 26°. It remained at this tempera- ture about an hour, and all the time liquid: the red particles had subsided, and the supernatant fluid was colourless. It was then put into a freezing mixture of greater strength, and placed under the receiver of an air-pump; the air was exhausted, and the pump was worked till the blood was apparently frozen. After it had been some minutes frozen, I took it out, and applying a thermometer, found the freezing mixture at 10°. On pressing the frozen white part, a little fluid rose from the cruor,—the temperature of which was found to be 32°. The experiment was repeated till the whole was frozen. The lymph was

414 GENERAL REMARKS ON BICHAT's compacted together, he is persuaded, that a macera- tion of three or four days would suffice to reduce them to a putrid mass.* Mucous membranes he describes as peculiarly apt to yield to maceration,—more so, indeed, he asserts, than any other animal substance, with the exception of brain; and he brings forward the re- mark, without distinction, without exception, as ap- plicable to the membranes generally.f It would be of little use to attempt to explain the discrepancy of these results,—I mean of those which I have described as witnessed by myself, and those referred to of Bichat. What I have observed, in multiplied instances, convinces me, that pure ten- dinous fibre, as regards tendency to change from maceration, is remarkably little prone to it; and the circumstances which I have mentioned in re- lating the phenomena, appear to me demonstrative of it—especially one, viz. when a mass of tendon is distintegrated by maceration, its minute fibres, after a very long lapse of time, may be picked out very little altered. As regards his remark on mucous membranes, relative to the effects of maceration, it appears to me to be deficient in correctness, from its extreme generalness. The observations which I have de- tailed, shew how great is the difference in different mucous membranes, and even in different parts of the same canal in relation to the effect of this process. * Anatomie Gendrale, i, 162. -j- Idem. iv. 21.

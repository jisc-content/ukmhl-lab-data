144 EXPERIMENTS ON THE BLOOD Seven cubic inches of sheep's blood from the jugular vein, its fibrin broken up by agitation with lead whilst coagulating, out of contact with air, and cooled under water, were agitated with hydrogen (twenty-five cubic inches), previously well-washed with lime-water, and which, tested by lime-water, after this precaution were found perfectly free from car- bonic acid. On turning the stop-cock of the bent tube connected with distilled water, no change of volume was indicated, and the blood was agitated again with the same result. By means of the per- pendicular tube distilled water was admitted, and some of the gas expelled ; first a cubic inch into a graduated tube filled with lime-water, and next about four cubic inches into a vial filled with distilled water, and in which afterwards a little lime-water was added to the gas ; in neither could any traces of carbonic acid be detected ; the lime-water remained trans- parent. Ten cubic inches of venous blood, taken by a large orifice from the arm of a young man threatened with haemoptysis, the fibrin broken up in the same manner as the last, and rapidly cooled under water in a running stream to the temperature of the room, 51Â°, were similarly treated with hydrogen, and with precisely the same result; after having been twice well shaken, on turning the stop-cock, there was no change of volume. The blood was kept in contact with the hydrogen over-night, the stop-cocks closed. The night, that of the 23rd of January, was severely

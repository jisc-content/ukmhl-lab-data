428 DUCTUS COMMUNIS CHOLEDOCHUS ; to this structure, I have examined the ducts in question in a large number of instances : I have invariably found it to exist; but sometimes more, sometimes less developed. The processes, or val- vular projections, commonly first make their appear- ance (tracing the passage downwards from the liver) a little above the place of junction of the pancreatic duct, and are continued to the termination of the common duct in the intestine. In the pancreatic duct, they are more limited ; they are confined to its mouth, and occasionally to a small portion of the tube adjoining, not more than two lines from its mouth. Their valvular nature is easily shewn by the intro- duction of a probe ; directed downwards, towards the intestine, it passes smoothly without obstruction ; but in the contrary direction, towards the liver, it is impeded and stopped, arrested by the minute sacculi, which exist at the base of the processes. The use of these processes is implied in their valvular nature and situation : whilst they do not stop the descent of the secreted fluids, which it is the office of the ducts to discharge, they are well adapted to prevent the pancreatic juice from ascend- ing either into the gall bladder or the liver, and the bile from flowing or penetrating into the pancreas. I have been desirous of learning if a similar structure exists in other animals ; but I regret to say, that in no work on comparative anatomy which I have yet consulted, whether systematic or special,

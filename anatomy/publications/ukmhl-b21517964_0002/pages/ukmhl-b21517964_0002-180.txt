168 EXPERIMENTS ON THE BLOOD the air-pump. Is not this also in favour of the above inference, that a portion of oxygen is retained by the blood resisting extraction by the air-pump ? I find also that when venous blood is agitated with oxygen and subjected to the air-pump, it, in like manner, retains its acquired florid vermilion hue, and likewise a power of absorbing an additional quantity of nitrous gas. 7.— When Oxygen is absorbed by the Blood is there any production of Heat ? To endeavour to determine this point, of so much interest in connexion with the theory of animal heat, a very thin vial, of the capacity of eight liquid ounces, was selected and carefully enveloped in bad conducting substances, viz. several folds of flannel, of fine oiled paper, and of oiled cloth. Thus pre- pared, and a perforated cork being provided, holding a delicate thermometer, two cubic inches of mercury were introduced, and immediately after it was filled with venous blood, kept liquid as before described. The vial was now corked and shaken; the ther- mometer included was stationary at 45°. After five minutes that it was so stationary, the ther- mometer was withdrawn, the vial closed by another cork was transferred inverted to a mercurial bath, and 1J cubic inch of oxygen was introduced. The common cork was returned, and the vial was well agitated for about a minute; the thermometer was now introduced, it rose immediately to 46°, and con-

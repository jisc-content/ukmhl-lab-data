299 XII. ON THE ACTION OF LIME ON VEGETABLE SUB- STANCES. Reasoning from analogy, from what I had witnessed of the effects of lime on animal substances, I was induced to question the views which are commonly entertained of the operation of this earth on vegeta- ble matters,â€”as its supposed power of facilitating their decomposition, and promoting their fermenta- tion and solution. And the few experiments which I have made have more than confirmed me in my doubts. As the subject is of very great importance in rela- tion to agriculture, I shall describe the results which were obtained, using small quantities as most man- ageable and best accordant with my limited means, hoping that my statements may induce others to re- peat the experiments on a large scale, and extend them in a manner befitting the consequences in- volved. The experiments were commenced in June 1836, and they were concluded in November 1838. I shall describe them individually. On the 27th of June 1836, one portion of saw

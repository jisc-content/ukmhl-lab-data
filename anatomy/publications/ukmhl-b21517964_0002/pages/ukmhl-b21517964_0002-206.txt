194 OBSERVATIONS ON THE BLOOD grumous, not distinctly coagulated, death was owing to confluent variola ; the lungs were hepatized. In the other instance, the disease was returned debility; it was of a very obscure nature, and not connected with any well marked organic lesion. Whilst grumous blood was found in the cavities of the heart in this case, fibrinous concretions were met with in the great vessels. 7. In the solitary case in which the blood was found liquid and frothy, and did not coagulate on ex- posure, putrefaction was far advanced; and it is pro- bable that the fibrin had become liquid after coagu- lation in consequence of putrefaction. In this in- stance all the parts in contact with blood were strongly stained by the colouring matter of the blood in a state of solution in the serum. The pheno- menon of the red stain, as a post mortem effect, is, I believe, invariably connected with this condition of the serum, and which itself is connected more or less with putrefaction. I have never yet. met with an exception to this remark; wherever I have found red serum, on microscopical examination, I have detected change in the form of the red parti- cles, indicative more or less of decomposition.* * Most animal textures, chemically considered, have a strong affinity for the colouring matter both of blood and bile,—and for the former especially when in solution, that is, separated from the blood-corpuscles, whether in water or serum. In a paper com- municated to the Medico-Chirurgical Society of London, in 1818, and published in its Transactions,—I pointed out certain false ap- pearances of inflammation, post mortem effects, connected with this

AND FLUID IN THE PERICARDIUM. 247 There were about three ounces of a similar fluid in the right pleura, and the effect of the test on it was similar : the greenish hue imparted was perhaps a shade lighter. There was very little cruor, crassa- mentum, or fibrinous concretion in any of the cavities of the heart, and no appearance of any of the solution. A semilunar valve of the pulmonary artery tested was strongly coloured bluish-green; the substance of the lungs exhibited on trial the same hue in a less degree, and it appeared even faintly in the frothy fluid con- tained in the bronchia. May not these results be considered a confirma- tion of the preceding, so far at least as regards the wide spread of the solution,â€”and there being no proof of any accumulation of it in the pericardium. It may be said, that accumulation in the pericar- dium could hardly be expected, as the greater part of it seems to have passed into the lungs. But is it not probable, that when serum separates from the blood in the heart after death, it will pass out through that channel, chiefly, if there is any undue pressure, and that the exudation into the pericardium, will be trifling and even less than from the pericardium into the pleura. Experiment 3. On the 18th September, twelve hours after death from complicated organic disease of the lungs, in- troduced about four ounces of a weak solution of the triple prussiate into the left pleura, through an

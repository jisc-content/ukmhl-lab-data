92 MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS The results of the experiment with the urine, are, perhaps, not undeserving of more particular notice. About two ounces of blood were mixed as it flowed from the arm, with four ounces of urine, containing, perhaps, rather a larger proportion than usual of urea. After about an hour and half the blood had gelatinized. After twenty-four hours, it had coagu- lated pretty firmly ; the coagulum was much con- tracted and slightly cupped, and covered with a thick buffy coat. After forty-eight hours the coagu- lum was still more contracted, and it had acquired a globular form with a little concavity on its upper surface. The urine was only just perceptibly coloured by the colouring matter of the blood. I may here incidentally remark, that this fluid is particularly well adapted as a medium for displaying the phenomena of the coagulation of the blood, from its retarding the effect, and yet not diminishing it,â€”and from its not dissolving the colouring matter of the red par- ticles. It enables one to determine, in a satisfactory manner, especially with the aid of sections, that the phenomena of the buffy coat, and the cupping of the blood, are owing to an unequal distribution of the fibrin; and that, when they occur, there is an excess of fibrin at and towards the surface of the crassa- mentum, which, it may be inferred, was pressed up by the red particles in descending; and a deficiency of it at the bottom, and towards it, in regular grada- tion ; and that the buffy coat is cupped in conse-

448 ON THE MALE ORGANS OF SOME terior surface. There appeared to be a connexion between the upper portion of the epididymis and of the testis by three or four filaments or tubes. These in the first instance I carefully cut out, avoiding, with the scissors, equally the testis and epididymis.

And similar animalcules were found in the fluid of the globular testis, with like globules, and also a bundle of animalcules. In the milt-like appendage, globules only were ob- servable, of different sizes, the largest appeared as if composed of very many extremely small ones. The entozoa were found in abundance in the cream- like fluid of the epididymis, — which in no wise differed in appearance from those of the testis and connecting tubes or vasa efferentia. 5.— Of the Male Organs of Scyllium Edwardii.

The parts were not in the best condition; they had suffered from keeping, especially the testes. The epididy-

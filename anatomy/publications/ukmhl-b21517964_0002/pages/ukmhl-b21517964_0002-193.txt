IN CONNEXION WITH RESPIRATION. 181 In the instance of muriate of ammonia and carbonate of potash, a little of the colouring matter was dis- solved, and the colour of the mixture was less bright, and the blood discs were a little smaller.* Experiment 3. A little muriatic acid and cruor were mixed to- gether, the former not in sufficient quantity to coagu- late the serum. The mixture presently acquired a darker hue. Under the microscope, the blood-cor- puscles appeared somewhat altered in form,—they were less distinctly disc-like,—they approached more to the globular, and had minute particles (probably of air) adhering to them. On the addition of more and of stronger acid,—effecting the coagulation of the serum,—the blood-corpuscles were found dimi- nished in size and irregularly globular; they were examined in a state of dilution by the addition of a little saturated brine. Do not these results warrant the preceding infer- ence ? All the facts with which I am acquainted appear to me, to indicate, that the colour of the blood, whether venous or arterial, that is, dark or florid, is independent of the saline matter in the serum, considered in relation to agency; and that * I have not found an aqueous solution of hematosine brightened in colour by common salt. It contains no globular particles sus- pended in it, like the mixture of cruor and brine, to enable the effect to be produced,—unless the common salt acted chemically, which if does not appear to do.

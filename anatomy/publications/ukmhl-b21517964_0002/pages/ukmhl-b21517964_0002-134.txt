122 MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS merely included in the ice in this instance, and not actually frozen. To ascertain the truth of such a notion, I have tried the effect of artificial cold, by means of freezing mixtures, on these animals, by which they have been rendered rigid and hard, so that they were doubtlessly frozen ; and yet, when thawed, they revived; but, with the exception of one, the death of all of them speedily followed. This result is the more remarkable, as the experiment was made during the height of summer in Malta, and with leeches suddenly taken from water almost tepid, and plunged into a freezing mixture, and when rigid were as suddenly plunged into the tepid water. Now, to return to the argument, if an animal, or even a part of an animal, can be frozen and not deprived of life, —why may not the same happen to a fluid ? Why may not its animation, in the same way, be sus- pended and restored ? The blood, after death, I have often found liquid, and that many hours after death, when cold, but still retaining its power of coagulating. What is to be hence inferred ? Does it not follow either that the liquid blood, though coagulable, is dead, and con- sequently, that coagulability is not a vital property ? or that this blood possesses life after the death of the body,—after the muscular fibre has lost its irritability, and the limbs have become rigid, and even partial decomposition has commenced ? It would require little ingenuity to extend and vary these speculations ; but, I apprehend, the

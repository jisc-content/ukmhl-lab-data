266 ON THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF than we yet possess in this important but obscure branch of medical knowledge: but for this latter purpose the investigation will require to be prose- cuted further. The quality of specific gravity will, probably, be most applicable, as a characteristic to the viscera,â€”especially the liver and the spleen; and perhaps, the brain, lungs, and kidneys. The results given of the experiments on the two first men- tioned viscera are favourable to this conjecture. These results are very various, and almost demon- strative that organic disease of the viscera cannot take place without altering their specific gravity; and, if so, it is not improbable that this precise quality may be made an index of the kind and de- gree of organic change. And, a priori, perhaps, thus much might be inferred; for if fatty matter is deposited, the specific gravity must be diminished; if cartilaginous matter, it is probable it will be in- creased ; probably, it will be variously diminished or increased according to the kind of deposition. Moreover, attention to these changes may lead to more minute observation, and to the collecting of information curious and useful. Every new means of research is in this way indirectly beneficial. Whoever employs the stethoscope, though he may not appreciate its merits in the same high degree as the ingenious inventor of the instrument did, yet he cannot fail to derive instruction from its use, and to become better, more minutely, more discrimina- tively acquainted with the diseases of the chest.

AND FLUID IN THE PERICARDIUM. 239 blood may be used as an illustration of the short time in which strong adhesions may form; and I do not know a better confirmation of the fact. Liquid, when the blood is drawn, coagulable lymph gradually becomes—first, viscid, and afterwards solid. In the viscid state, as I have frequently ob- served, when it is still transparent, it has the tenacity of mucus, and admits of being drawn out into fibres and bands, which soon becoming firm and opaque very well represent the ordinary adhesions of the lungs,—and in a very few hours attain their maxi- mum of strength. This viscidity, which coagulable lymph acquires, in passing from a liquid to a solid form, has not, that I am aware, been noticed by authors; and the formation of adhesions is usually explained without reference to this quality.* 1. It is believed by many writers and by some of high authority, that the small portions of serous fluid, which are found after death, in the cavities of serous membranes, especially in the pericardium and the ventricles of the brain, may have been poured out after the cessation of life.f I am not aware that this * Vide "The Morbid Anatomy of some of the most important parts of the Human Body," by Matthew Baillie, M.D., F.R.S., fifth edition, p. 6.

ON THE BLOOD. 91 oil, on the blood, in passing through it; and, in part, to the exclusion of air. 10.— On the Effect of Water, Milk, Urine, and Bile, on the Coagulation of the Blood. It has been remarked by Dr. Crawford, in his treatise on Animal Heat,* that, by the dilution of blood with water, in the proportion of twelve parts of the latter to one of the former, its coagulation is retarded for several hours. In one instance, in which I made this experiment, at the end of two hours, the diluted blood appeared to be liquid; but, when thrown upon a filter this appearance proved to be deceptive; the fibrin had coagulated, and it was collected on the filter in the form of a very tender gelatinous mass. From this, and from other experi- ments, I am inclined to infer, as might be expected d priori, that dilution, by removing the particles of fibrin, to a greater distance from each other,—and by suddenly cooling the blood, does retard its coagu- lation,—but not so long as Dr. Crawford conceived, who formed his opinion on the subject merely from the appearance of the blood. Milk, urine, and bile, I find, also retard the coagu- lation of the blood, and more so even than water. The urine and bile used were human,—the milk, cow's. * Experiments and Observations on Animal Heat, p. 278, 2nd edition.

360' ON THE AGENCY OF ATMOSPHERIC heat ? But substituting digestion for putrefaction, an answer still may be required. The circumstance that some carbonic acid gas is formed in the stomach and intestines, (supposing that which is found, is formed there,) is favourable to the idea of digestion being an auxiliary source of heat. The observations which I have made on the temperature of the stomach in animals, is also in favour of the idea; I have often found it as high as that of the heart, and sometimes, though rarely, a degree higher. The conversion of a solid into a fluid, as of solid food into chyme, or chyle, appears rather an objection to the notion. But, I am not sure that is a valid ob- jection, when properly considered, there being so many remarkable exceptions of the kind, even in instances in which the change of form is greater, as in that of the conversion of a solid into a gas, accom- panied by combustion, without condensation, even of the supporter of combustion; and vice versa, of the formation of a solid from the union of two gases without change of temperature. Neither, am I aware of any remarkable change of form of an animal or vegetable substance, which is accompanied either by absorption, or by evolution of heat. The fibrin of the blood appears to coagulate without change of temperature; no heat is evolved when serum is coagulated by an acid; none when a strono- solution of gum is coagulated by sugar of lead ; none when milk is coagulated by rennet.

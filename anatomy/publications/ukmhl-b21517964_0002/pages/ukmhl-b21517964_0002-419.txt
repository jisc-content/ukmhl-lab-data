DIFFERENT TEXTURES OF THE HUMAN BODY. 407 months' maceration in water, changed daily, or every second day, still retained their form, and were only partially corroded or wasted; as the skin of the glans penis, and its internal structure, and as the ligamentous sheath of the corpus cavernosum. The process of change in all these parts appears to be very similar in kind to that of the dura mater, though much slower, excepting the upper part of the urethra, where that membrane is very thin, and where con- tiguous to it are numerous mucous glandules, which undergo change rapidly, and seem to accelerate its change. The process of change appears to be by the formation of a mucus-like substance, which in the penis I have noticed of very various colours, as pink, dull-brown, bright-brown, orange, and green. It is preceded by softening of the parts; it takes place chiefly at the surface, or in the portions most exposed to the action of the water; it is not equa- ble ; but, as in the dura mater, spreads as it were from certain points or centres, reminding one of ulceration,—the part affected seemingly protecting the contiguous part within certain limits from change. Tendon, (4, &c.)—This part under my observa- tion has undergone change very slowly; and the less mixed it has been with other tissues, so much the less prone has it been to alteration. A portion of the tendo achillis of a limb amputated on the 16th October, 1828, after constant maceration for many months, was little changed; the longitudinal fibres were still strong; and when the adhering

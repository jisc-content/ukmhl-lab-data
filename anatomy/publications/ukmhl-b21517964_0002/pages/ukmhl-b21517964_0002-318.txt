306 EFFECTS OF TANNIN ON THE employed were from the body of a man, aged thirty- five years, who had died from the effects of a severe injury, occasioned by a fall; they were kept im- mersed until the 4th of July. The parts subjected to the experiments, the in- stant they were separated from the body, were deprived of superfluous moisture, by pressure be- tween folds of blotting paper, and then carefully weighed, and immediately after put into a strong infusion of catechu, with some catechu in powder. In every instance, putrefaction to a certain extent took place; after a while it diminished and ceased. The infusion was changed once or oftener in the course of the experiment, according to circumstances; or, if the part was very small, not at all. The ex- periments were continued till a full effect appeared to be produced; to ascertain which, the parts were occasionally taken out and examined, and partially dried by blotting paper, and weighed. The follow- ing table shews the quantity of solid matter per cent, which each afforded, when dried on a vapour- bath, as in the experiments on desiccation. The increase of weight, it was supposed, when it could be clearly established, would serve to indicate the quantity of combined tannin.

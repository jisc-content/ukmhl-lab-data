230 TRIALS WITH THE AIR-PUMP ON scalpel just dipped in water purged of air, and as soon as cut out, immersed in the same water. But, in the instances of the other viscera, I have always found more or less air disengaged, on sub- jecting portions of them in the same manner to the action of the air-pump, The proportion of air evolved appeared to accord with the degree of vas- cularity of the part. This, I apprehend, is what might be expected d priori, taking into account the rapidity with which air enters the arteries, when they are divided, owing to their expansion on the access of air, depending on their elasticity. I shall offer a partial proof of an experimental kind. Two rabbits of the same age were killed; one, by dividing the great cervical blood-vessels ; the other? by a blow on the occiput. The thorax of each was opened before they were cold. In the heart of the first-mentioned, there was evidently air, and even in the coronary vessels. In the heart of the second, there was no appearance of air ; it was moderately distended with blood, and its vessels were full of blood. A ligature was applied to the great vessels of each, and the hearts were removed and put into water. The first swam ; the second sank. Under an exhausted receiver, the first was amazingly dis- tended ; its blood-vessels also were distended, and their very minute ramifications were beautifully dis- played, variously anastomosing : very littte of the air was disengaged. The second was not at all dis- tended ; a few bubbles of air only were given off,

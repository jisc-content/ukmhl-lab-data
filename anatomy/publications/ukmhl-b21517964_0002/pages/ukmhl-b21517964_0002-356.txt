ON THE AGENCY OF ATMOSPHERIC 344 drops, and it had a pretty strong and tolerably pure ammoniacal odour. After this, there was no sen- sible elevation of temperature attending the changes which slowly took place during its progressive de- composition. These experiments on the blood and its ingre- dients, I may remark, are not solitary ones ; they have been repeated several times ; and the results have been similar ; and similar generally, so far as I have observed, whether the subject was the blood of the ox or human blood. Muscle.—On the 25th August, the psoas muscle of a man who died the same day, and of whose case I shall take brief notice in an Appendix, as No. 1, was placed for observation. No change of tem- perature was observable till the 27th ; then it was 2° higher than the water ; its odour was not putrid. On the following day, its temperature was the same ; its odour peculiar and disagreeable, but not distinctly fetid; its surface was sprinkled with the ova of flies, and with minute larva?. On the 29th, it was 3° above the water. On the 30th, at the surface, it was 5° higher, whilst about an inch below, its tem- perature was the same as that of the water. On its surface there was some froth, and larvae in great abundance. The odour of the surface was peculiar and ammoniacal; of the part below the surface, peculiar, but not distinctly ammoniacal. On the 31st, it was 7° above the water, when larvee abounded, and were feeding voraciously, and there was a strong

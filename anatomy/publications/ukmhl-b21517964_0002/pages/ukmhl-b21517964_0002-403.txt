DIFFERENT TEXTURES OF THE HUMAN BODY. 391 of the parotid duct, there from beginning to end it suffered change very slowly. Over the tonsils it experienced the first or cribriform change very ra- pidly. The glands constituting the tonsils, were soon converted into a semifluid fetid matter, which was removed by washing, and there remained only a tissue of strong white fibres. Where the mem- brane was very thin, and at the same time penetrated by numerous ducts of mucous glands, as under the tongue, and especially on each side of its fraenum, and in the back part of the fauces, there it under- went change rapidly, and it was soon reduced to a mucilage-like and shreddy state. The change which slowly took place in the lining membrane of these parts, bore a very close resemblance to that experienced by the cutis,—a slimy or mucilage-like matter formed,—the part became irregularly cor- roded and worn into holes,—it lost its strength, and the whole was gradually reduced to shreds, and these ultimately to particles, which indeed throughout the change were constantly forming, and as they formed were removed in changing the water. And I may remark that the tissue subjacent to the lining mem- brane, experienced the same kind of alteration; and the same kind of observation which induced me to consider the cutis as the external surface of the tissue connected with it, leads me also to infer that this membrane is an analogous boundary of the tex- ture beneath it. Tongue, (7. 8.)—I have not alluded above to the epithelium of the lining membrane of the mouth;

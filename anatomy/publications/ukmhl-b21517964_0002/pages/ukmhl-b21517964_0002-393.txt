DIFFERENT TEXTURES OF THE HUMAN BODY. 381 distinctly remained but the vascular structure of the spleen, contained in its enveloping membrane, and presenting a beautiful and instructive appearance, the vessels anastomosing very freely, and in a cer- tain regular manner, and retaining their strength very little impaired. Here I may remark, that with the spleen thus prepared, I have often endeavoured to discover the cribriform structure, of late years attributed by some anatomists to the splenic veins. No where could I observe this structure; every opening in the sides of the veins which I could de- tect, was an opening into a branch. After the sepa- ration of the soft matter, when the maceration of the spleen was continued, it slowly underwent change, and wasted away; the more delicate structure dis- appearing first, and the trunks of the vessel, and the including membrane enduring longest, much in the same manner as the larger vessels generally, and the fibrous and serous membranes, which will be consi- dered hereafter. Pancreas. (2. 3. 7-)—This organ softened nearly as rapidly as the spleen. When gently pressed under water, the soft fetid matter was separated ; and after two or three days successively renewing the pressure, nothing but its vascular structure and its duct re- mained, which latter was of great strength, and resisted further maceration for a long time. Parotid gland. (6. 9.)—It softened much in the same manner as the pancreas, and the poultaceous matter derived from it was very similar. After the

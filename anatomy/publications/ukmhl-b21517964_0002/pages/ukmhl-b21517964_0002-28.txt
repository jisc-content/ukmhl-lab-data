16 EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS stituent parts of the blood, or those in which it is resolvable when abstracted from the vessels, the red particles are of greatest specific gravity, the serum of least, and the coagulable lymph intermediate. That the red particles are as he considers them, is now universally admitted : but it has been more than doubted by one inquirer, that the serum is lighter than the lymph ;* and by another, that there is any difference of specific gravity between them.f I have repeated the experiments, on the results of which Mr. Hunter founded his conclusion, and I have no hesitation in adopting it entirely. In every instance in which according to his method, I have immersed coagulable lymph in serum, I have in- variably seen it sink, unless buoyed up by adhering particles of air. The specific gravity of the different parts of the blood is probably variable within certain limits, as is the specific gravity of the blood itself even within the limits of health, according to a variety of cir- cumstances, which it may be difficult to enumerate, and much more to appreciate, connected with age, sex, climate, diet, &c. I shall not in this place endeavour to determine what may be considered the standard specific gra- vity either of the blood itself, or of its serous or fibrinous parts. To accomplish this, a very wide comparison of accurate observations would be re- * Sir C. Scudamore. Essay on the Blood, p. 35. t Dr. Benjamin Babington, Med. Ch.

ON THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF 264 The first instance I shall offer is that of the parietal bone of a man of middle age, a case of amentia, which proved fatal in consequence of pulmonary consumption. Before being subjected to the air-pump, its speci- fic gravity appeared to be 1790 to distilled water as 1000 ; after exhaustion, 1970.* The quantity of air disengaged was very great; and it required long continued pumping to remove it, indeed, after working the pump for more than an hour almost uninter- ruptedly, a few particles continued to be disengaged. A portion of the same bone was calcined. The fixed part, indestructible in the fire, consisting chiefly of phosphate of lime, weighed before being subjected to the air-pump, appeared to be of specific gravity 2580, and after of specific gravity 3070.f Another portion of the same bone was kept im- mersed in dilute muriatic acid, until all the calca- reous matter was dissolved ; the residual cartilage was well washed and afterwards gently pressed be- tween folds of linen, to remove all the moisture that could then be separated : thus treated, before being * The bone was dry, prepared for the Museum ; but it contained some hygrometric water. Exposed to a temperature of about boiling water for three hours, it lost 9'84 per cent, water ; making allowance for which, its specific gravity would be, instead of 1970,2200. This example may serve to illustrate the influence of moisture in ascertain- ing the specific gravities of animal structures. t The specific gravity of mineral phosphate of limeâ€”apatite, is from 3100 to 3200.

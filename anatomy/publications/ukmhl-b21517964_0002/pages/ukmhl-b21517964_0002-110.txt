98 MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS tine, hydroboracic acid, white oxide of arsenic, and gum-arabic. In each instance, there was some slight peculiarity in the result, as in relation to the colour which the crassamentum exhibited, or its degree of contraction or consistency. I shall notice a few of them, those which were best marked. Sugar, refined in powder, added to the blood the instant it was drawn, did not appear to retard coagu- lation ; the coagulum was very soft, and bright red. After twenty-four hours very little serum had sepa- rated, and there was scarcely any perceptible con- traction of the clot; the fibrin collected by means of a linen filter, gentle pressure being used, was very soft. The fluid part, obtained by filtration, did not jelly when diluted with water. The experiment was made in Corfu, in November, when the temperature of the air of the room was between 50° and 60°. After a week, there were no signs of putrefaction, either in the diluted or undiluted mixture ; both had a very slight smell of vinegar, The effect of the white oxide of arsenic on the blood differed but little from that of sugar; it did not appear either to retard or accelerate its coagu- lation. The coagulum, however, after twenty-four hours was comparatively soft, having scarcely percep- tibly contracted, and no separation of serum had taken place. The surface was unusually fluid, and also the bottom of the coagulum in contact with the principal part of the oxide. This experiment was

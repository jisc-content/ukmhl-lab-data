OF THE CARTILAGINOUS FISHES. 439 the results, the majority of which have already ap- peared in a paper communicated to the Royal Society, and which has been published in the 1st part of the Philosophical Transactions for the present year. 1.— Of the Male Organs of the Torpedo. Two good specimens of this fish, from the Me- diterranean, of middle size, one an oculata (T. oculata), the other a tremola (T. diversicolor), be- longing to the Museum of Natural History at Fort Pitt, have enabled me to institute a careful exami- nation of the organs in question of these species. The result has accorded perfectly with my first ob- servations made at Malta on the same species in a fresh state. The testes appeared as I have briefly described them, in relation to form, situation and consistence ; exhibiting indistinctly the globular structure described by Baron Cuvier in the passage quoted,*—(vide Plate 1. Fig. 2). In neither instance could I discover any traces of the attached soft glandular structure no- ticed by Cuvier. The epididymis of each organ was comparatively large, and distinctly tubular, terminat- ing below in a large tortuous vas deferens, which pro- * The form of the testes in different specimens of the torpedo, and of the same species, varies very much; the oval is perhaps the most common; in three now before me, one is of this shape, another is somewhat spherical, and a third is nearly disc-shaped.

EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS 8 commonly called the coagulation of the blood, is merely the coagulation of one of the ingredients of this fluid, viz. the fibrin, which constitutes only a very small part of the whole mass; for instance, in the blood of the lamb, it does not exceed 2 per cent, as I have ascertained by experiment. Moreover, it is worthy of remark, that though the coagulation commences suddenly, and is apparently rapid, yet the contraction or condensation depending on the coalescing of the solid particles, is slow; requiring many hours for its completion. All these circum- stances considered, even admitting the law referred to, how small should be the degree of heat evolved in accordance with it, during the act of coagulation! So small indeed, that it can hardly be admitted to be cognisable by our senses; its detection, I must confess, would appear to me almost miraculous. In confirmation of this conclusion, I shall give some additional facts on the subject, which I had an opportunity of collecting in 1816, on my voyage to Ceylon, in experimenting on the blood of the turtle and shark. On the 15th of March, when our ship was in latitude 4째 9' N. and longitude 19째 15' W. by chro- nometer, at sunset, a large shark was taken by means of a harpoon. As soon as it was brought on board, while it was yet alive, it was cut in two. The blood flowing from the great dorsal vein was 82째; the sur- rounding thick muscles were 82*5, the water of the sea was 80 5, and the air 79째. Some of the blood

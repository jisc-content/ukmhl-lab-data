DIFFERENT TEXTURES OF THE HUMAN BODY. 387 to decay first, the coarser fibres became so much the more apparent. Sometimes the membrane divided into two layers, — occasionally into three or more laminae; but it was always easy in this stage to effect its separation into two. Progressively every part partook of the change, and the membrane was reduced to shreds and particles. Some of these shreds I have examined after having been in ma- ceration eleven months. Internally, when drawn asunder, they displayed the original colour and lustre, and texture of the dura mater, and they them- selves appeared to be in progress to ultimate de- composition. It was curious to observe the dif- ferent specimens placed under similar circumstances undergoing change. Hardly in any two was the change exactly similar, varying either in the rapidity with which it took place, or in the discoloration attending it; and this without any apparent cause, as if owing to difference of composition not appre- ciable by the eye. During the early progress of the experiments, I have often sought to discover, on the inner surface of the dura mater, the arachnoid membrane; but I was never able to succeed in de- tecting it. And I may here remark, that all the other attempts which I have made to demonstrate it have been failures ; and in consequence I am dis- posed to believe that it is not reflected over the dura mater according to the ingenious idea of Bichat.

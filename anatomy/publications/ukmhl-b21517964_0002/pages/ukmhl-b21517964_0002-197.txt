185 IN CONNEXION WITH RESPIRATION. that that air is carbonic acid, it will be easy to account for it by the results adverted to in the pre- ceding 8th section. To endeavour to determine this point, as regards matter of fact, I have availed myself of the opportunities which have offered in the General Hospital at Fort Pitt, to institute on the cadaver the examination necessary. The inquiry was begun in the month of September, 1838; and in every fatal case that afterwards oc- curred, with the exception of four, during a period of six months' search was made for air. As most convenient for examination and best fitted to give accurate results, the internal jugular vein (thinking- it advantageous to extend the inquiry to this vessel) and the carotid artery in the middle of the neck, were selected for the purpose. In every instance the vessels were exposed with caution,â€”as much care as possible being taken to avoid the wounding of branches. To determine if any air was in the vein, not satisfied merely with the appearance of the vein, a puncture was always made into it, and some blood pressed out: and, to determine the same of the artery, a portion of it, about an inch in length, where it gives off no branches, was included between two ligatures; cut out so secured; and transferred to water and there opened. The description of cases in which the trials were made, is shewn in the two following Tables, in which also are noticed some other particulars, which for the sake of ac- curacy it appears desirable to specify.

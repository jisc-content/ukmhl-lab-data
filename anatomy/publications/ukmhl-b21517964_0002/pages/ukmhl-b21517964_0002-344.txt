332 ON THE AGENCY OF ATMOSPHERIC Surgical Journal, I shall now give only such as, on revision, I believe to be correct and liable to no serious objection. 1.— On the Agitation of dead Animal Matter in Atmospheric Air. The results of the latest experiments which I have made on the agitation of blood and serum in air, have already been stated, shewing, that, inde- pendent of putrefaction, both venous and arterial blood have the power in question; but that serum does not appear to possess it, in an appreciable de- gree. Respecting serum, I think it right to express myself in this qualified manner in consideration of the well established fact,—first I believe pointed out by Dr. Priestley,* that venous crassamentum, when guarded from the atmosphere merely by a thin covering of serum acquires superficially the arterial hue; indicating the passage, if not the absorption of oxygen gas. To try the effect of the solids, — two substances have been selected as best fitted to give decisive results, viz., cerebral matter and muscular fibre. The experiments on the agitation of these sub- stances have been made in a manner very similar to those described on blood and serum. The brain of a sheep was used—its masseter muscles and * Experiments and Observations on different kinds of Air; by Joseph Priestley, Birmingham, 1790, vol. iii. pp. 365. 370.

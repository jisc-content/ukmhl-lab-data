AND FLUID IN THE PERICARDIUM. 249 dation of fluids. They also seem to shew that the amount of exudation is inconsiderable ; and to render it highly improbable, that in the instance of the peri- cardium, pleurae, or ventricles of the brain, or indeed in the instance of any closed cavity of the body, accumulation, (the consequence of exudation,) should take place. Other facts might be brought forward in support and illustration of the preceding views. I shall very briefly mention a small number. 1. There is no relation between the quantity of blood in the cavities of the heart and the quantity of fluid found in the pericardium. Of this fact, I have satisfied myself by very many observations, taking into account the time elapsing between death and the examination of the body. Occasionally, the one is large and the other small, and vice versa. 2. There is no relation, as far as my experience extends, between the quality of the fluid in the peri- cardium, and the serum of the blood. I have men- tioned an instance in which one was colourless, and the other bright yellow. I have witnessed many instances in which the serum of the blood in the heart and great vessels was coloured red, some of the colouring matter of the red particles having been dissolved by it, and in which the same colour was exhibited in the inner lining membrane of the heart and great vessels, the effect of staining, without the liquor pericardii being tinged. 3. Coagulable lymph is very rarely found in the

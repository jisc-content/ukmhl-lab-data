ON THE BLOOD. 25 In all the instances of the mammalia the blood taken was from the jugular vein and carotid artery. All the animals were in apparent good health at the time the trials on the blood were made, with the exception of the zebra, which had a tumour in the nostril, and of which it died after a few weeks. From the results stated in the table, it clearly appears that arterial blood is of somewhat less specific gravity than venous, and arterial serum than venous serum. Taking the mean of all the experi- ments, the specific gravity of each kind of blood and serum, appears to be as follows:— Arterial blood 1050 „ serum 1022 Venous blood 1053 ,, serum 1026 Relative to the cause of the greater specific gra- vity of venous blood, it probably does not solely depend on the arterial blood's containing a larger proportion of water ; it probably depends partly on this cause and partly on the venous blood containing, besides a smaller proportion of water, a larger pro- portion of animal matter. But what the kind of matter is, whether the coloured particles, or fibrin, or some other substance, as free carbon, remains to be determined. Independent of this point, there seems to be little difficulty in accounting for the difference, considering the many fluids which are secreted from the arterial blood, and those comparatively dilute, and thereby manifestly tending to augment the

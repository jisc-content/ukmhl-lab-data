Such advanced putrefaction as was witnessed, is even uncommon in the time specified, in the hottest weather. At the moment,—reflecting on the degree of putrefaction, and the state of the blood, I had little doubt, that the latter was owing to the former, however that might be produced. This idea, I am still disposed to entertain, and even to extend to all similar cases. And the conclusion is the more probable, in relation to the like events in this coun- try, in as much as thunder storms are of rare oc- currence, and seldom severe excepting in summer and autumn, and in the most sultry weather, when the tendency to rapid putrefaction is greatest. It is mentioned in the account of the post mortem appearances, that the fingers were contracted and rigid. Hunter was of opinion, that the muscles of those struck by lightning are relaxed and entirely deprived of their tone.

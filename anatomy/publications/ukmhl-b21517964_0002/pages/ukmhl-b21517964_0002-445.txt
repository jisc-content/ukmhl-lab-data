AND THE FLOW OF THE BILE. 433 I shall conclude with a notice of some experi- ments which I made in 1829 on the dead body, connected with the points under consideration :— Experiment 1st. Applied a ligature to the pylorus, and made a small opening in the hepatic duct, just above the junction of the cystic, and successively distended by means of a powerful syringe the duodenum with water and with air: neither passed into the duct. Experiment 2d. After the duodenum had been well washed out, it was filled to distension with clear water. Pressure was made on the gall bladder and ducts ; the water in the duodenum was found strongly colored with bile ; and bile was found to pass when similar pres- sure was used, the duodenum being distended with air. Experiment 3d. Laid open the duodenum, so as to expose the papilla of the ductus communis choledochus, and having tied the hepatic duct, made pressure on the gall bladder;—the common duct was presently dis- tended with bile, but no bile passed into the in- testine ; a considerable degree of pressure was re- quired to make it flow into the intestine. And the result was the same, and even more strongly marked, when the hepatic duct was not tied. VOL. II. f F

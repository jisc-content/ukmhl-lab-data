150 EXPERIMENTS ON THE BLOOD inch. After twenty-four hours there was no change of volume; the blood in the tube had acquired throughout the arterial hue; the gas, thirty-eight measures, transferred to lime-water and agitated, diminished to thirty-two. The tube was now placed under a receiver, and the air exhausted by the air-pump ; a good deal of air was disengaged in the form of froth, and the gold- beaters' skin was so distended that it appeared ready to burst; after three or four minutes air was re-ad- mitted ; a notable portion of gas was found free between the membrane and blood ; thus showing that in oxygen gas carbonic acid gas is less freely exhaled through a membrane than in vacuo. The results of this second set of experiments are in accordance with those of the first. The inference I am induced to draw from both is rather of a negative kind, and unfavourable to the conclusion of Dr. Stevens, already referred to, at least in a strict and general sense. I think it right to express myself thus reservedly, reflecting on some of the experiments in which a very little carbonic acid gas appeared to be extricated on agitating blood with hydrogen ; and believing that Dr. Stevens, and other able inquirers, could not have been misled on a point so little ex- posed to fallacy. Relative to the effects which Dr. Stevens refers to the attraction of one gas for another, they appear to me, from what I have witnessed in carrying on the inquiry, to admit of explanation on Dr. Dalton's theory of mixed

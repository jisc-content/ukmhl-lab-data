ON THE BLOOD. 7 100°, was suddenly thrust to the bottom; it imme- diately rose to 102°. These comparative results arc manifestly not in favour of any heat being evolved during the coagu- lation of the blood; from them, it appears most probable, that the pause in the descent of the ther- mometer is rather owing to a disengagement of heat, from the warmer bottom of the vessel and the deeper fluid. With the hope of removing all doubt on the point at issue, the following experiment was instituted. To guard against rapid cooling, chiefly the effect of exposure to the air, the bottle for receiving the blood was enveloped in a large quantity of fine wool, which is one of the worst conductors of heat; a thermometer, as before, was introduced into the middle, through a cork, and the vessel was filled with warm water of the temperature 108°. Thus prepared, the carotid artery of a lamb was divided ; the bottle was emptied of water, and as soon as possible filled with arterial blood. The thermometer immediately stood at 104'5; it was thus stationary during five minutes; and even after twelve minutes it had fallen only half a degree. From these results generally, it appears to me, the conclusion is unavoidable, that little or no heat is evolved from the blood, as the effect of coagulation. If it be asked, is this an exception to the general rule, before announced, I would answer, that it is not. It was before observed, that what is

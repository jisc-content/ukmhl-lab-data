11 EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS flowed from the vessel; in a minute it was firmly coagulated. 3. Venous blood;—in two minutes it was slightly coagulated. Arterial blood; — in one minute it was firmly coagulated. From these experiments and others, the results of which were similar, and which, therefore, it is un- necessary to describe, it appears that arterial blood coagulates with greater rapidity than venous. Relative to the degree of contraction attending the coagulation of each kind of blood,—it was unques- tionably greatest in the instance of arterial; the difference of appearance was so distinct, measured merely by the eye, that there could be no mistake. In every comparative trial, after many hours, the venous blood was found softer and less contracted. 3.— Observations on the degree of coagulability of the first and last portion of blood from a slaughtered animal. Mr. Hewson observed that blood which flows last from a slaughtered animal coagulates more readily than that which flows first.* Mr. Hay, in his work on the blood, inferred the contrary from his own experiments.f The trials which I have instituted on this point, using the blood of the lamb and sheep, * Hewson on the Blood, p. 62. t Hay on the Blood, p. 2G.

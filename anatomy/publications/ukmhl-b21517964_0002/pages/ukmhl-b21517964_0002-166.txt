154 EXPERIMENTS ON THE BLOOD authority of Mr. Brande, in 1818, asserted that blood, both venous and arterial, under the exhausted re- ceiver evolves a large quantity of carbonic acid gas, an ounce of blood as much as two cubic inches of gas.* I repeated the experiment shortly after, but without confirming the result; neither by the air- pump, nor by heat applied even to coagulation of blood and serum in close vessels, did I succeed in demonstrating the extrication of this acid.f Since that time the experiment of the air-pump on the blood has been frequently made, and by observers of great accuracy, as by Drs. Duncan and Christison in this country, by MM. Tiedemann, Gmelin, Mits- chenlich and Miiller on the Continent, and recently by MM. Bischoff and Magnus. With the exception of the last-mentioned inquirers, the results have been negative. MM. Bischoff and Magnus, on the con- trary, state that by careful exhaustion they have obtained gas from the blood ; the former a small quantity of carbonic acid gas from venous blood, and a very little gas of a different kind from arterial, the nature of which he did not determine ; J the latter servatus, in vitrum collocetur, ex quo aer per antliam aeream exhau- ritur, sanguis iste in superficie, qua idem colorem floridum obtinuit, leniter effervescet, et in bullas assurget. Sin autem sanguis arteri- osus adhuc incalescens, in loco aere vacuo positus fuerit, idem mirum in modum expandehir, et in bullulas pene infinitas elevabitur: id quod a particulis ejus exeestuantibus, inque motum positis, partim ab aere particulis ejus interspersis oriri verisimile est." * Philosophical Transactions for 1818, p. 181. t Ibid. 1823, p. 516. t Commentatio de'novis quibusdam experiments chemico-physi-

296 ACTION OF LIME ON THE much finer, as if wasted, and more feeble, so as to be easily broken. Relative to the results of the experiments generally, they appear to me to bear me out in the remark with which I prefaced them, viz., that lime does not exercise a destructive corroding power on animal substances generally, or one promoting their decom- position ; but, on the contrary, a preservative and decidedly antiseptic power, arresting putrefaction, even when commenced, and retarding decomposition. What new arrangements of the elements of animal matter may take place under the influence of lime, is a subject for further inquiry. Probably the effects of lime on cuticle, nail, and hair, on which in the arts its operation has been best known, led to the ideas of its agency on animal substances generally, which I have been under the necessitv of com- bating. It was my intention to have instituted a set of experiments on the effects of the other earths, and also of the alkalies on animal textures; but this I have only very partially accomplished. From the few trials which I have made with ba- rytes and magnesia, the action of the former on animal substances generally, and also on the cuticle and nail appeared to be similar to that of lime, but more energetic ; whilst that of the latter appeared very much less, not arresting the putrefaction of the soft parts, and having, if any, an obscure and slight effect on cuticle and nail.

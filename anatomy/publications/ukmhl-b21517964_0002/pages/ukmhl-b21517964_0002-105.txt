93 ON THE BLOOD. quence of the unusual contraction of the fibrin and its accumulation at the circumference. It has been supposed by Mr. Brande, and after presence of an alkali,—and its coagulation, under certain circumstances, to the abstraction or neutra- lization of this alkali.* Dr. Bostock has objected * Whether the property of serum was known to the ancients, or, indeed, whether they were acquainted with the fluid itself, is, by some, thought doubtful, so imperfect is the history of physical science; moreover, it is even doubtful at what time, and by whom, the coagulability of serum, by heat, was first ascertained. Some writers, as Haller, refer, if not the discovery, at least the first men- tion of this quality to Harvey;—others, as Dr. Bostock, consider Harvey's notice of it obscure,—and seem to be of opinion that Lower was the first who clearly described it. Lower, in his account of the lupior pericardii, remarks,—"Porro humorem istum non mere excre- mentitium aut instar roris stillatitii aqueum, sed seri potius nutritii e sanguine promanantis, partem esse, exinde constat, quod ignis calori vel paululum admotus, non aliter quam serum sanguini post'vense sectionem innatans, aut lympha e glandulis secreta in gelatinam albam incrassatur: qualem quidem consistentiam nec sudor neque urina qualicunque coctione acquirit, sed vel omnino in auras exhalat, aut in sabulum induratur"—(Tract, de Corde, 1669, p. 6.) The author here speaks of the property as if well known to belong to the serum of the blood; and, I apprehend, the same inference may be made from certain remarks of Harvey, in connexion with coagulable lymph,—his mucago " si saniem illam a grumo separatam et efi'usam leni foco decoxeris, eandem brevi in mucaginem hanc mutatum iri conspicies. Indicio manifesto, aquam illam sive saniem, a sanguine 11.— On the Coagulation

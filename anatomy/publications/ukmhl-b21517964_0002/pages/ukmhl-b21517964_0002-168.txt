156 EXPERIMENTS ON THE BLOOD been rendered manifest, and both from arterial and venous blood. I shall briefly mention the trials which I consider most conclusive, and which satisfied me in spite of an opposite pre-existing bias. Vials provided with well-ground glass stoppers were filled with distilled water, deprived as much as possible of air by the air-pump; they were then placed under the receiver and kept in vacuo until all adhering air was removed; the stoppers were now introduced, all air being excluded, and they were instantly immersed in distilled water, which had been well boiled. Thus prepared they were taken to an adjoining slaughter-house, where they were filled with sheep's blood in the following manner, without its coming in contact with the air. For venous blood the jugular vein was exposed; two ligatures were applied to it; the vein was divided between the two, and the upper part, slightly detached, was introduced into a prepared vial under water the instant the stopper was withdrawn, and laid open. The heavier blood proceeding from the vessel of course expelled the water; and when it was supposed to be all expelled, the stopper was restored, and the vial was replaced in the water. In the instance of arterial blood it was collected in the same manner from the carotid artery. In some trials the blood was allowed to coagulate undis- turbed ; in others the fibrin was detached, and the liquidity of the blood preserved by agitating it, the

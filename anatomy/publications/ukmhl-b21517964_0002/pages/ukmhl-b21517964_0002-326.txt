314 EFFECTS OF BOILING ON THE membranes, did not appear to contract or undergo any change of form, neither the cortical or medullary part: they were rendered, however, weaker, as if the cohesion of their particles was diminished,â€”giving way when an attempt was made to raise a portion with the forceps; and yet they were not sensibly softened. 2. Muscle ; a portion of gastrocnemius contracted pretty much, and apparently in all its dimensions. Portions of other muscles were tried, and with like effect. At the same time, that they appeared to be condensed, they became comparatively pale ; and also rather hard, seeming to retain their strength of fibre. 3. Liver, spleen, kidney, lung; each of these experienced contraction, and all of them became friable. The portion of lung, when covered with hot water, quite effervesced, so much air was disen- gaged, partly, no doubt, from the expansion of the contained air from heat, but, chiefly probably from contraction of the air-cells. 4. Cartilage; a superficial slice of the investing cartilage of patella, contracted pretty much and be- came bent, forming nearly half a circle; the next slice contracted and was bent much less, giving rise to the idea, that the greater effect on the former was owing to its possessing a delicate membrane, liable to greater contraction from heat, than the substance of cartilage alone.* * There is a preparation, in the Museum of the Army Medical

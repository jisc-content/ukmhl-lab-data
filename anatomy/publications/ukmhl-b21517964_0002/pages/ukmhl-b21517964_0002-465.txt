OF THE CARTILAGINOUS FISHES. 453 creting an opaque fluid, similar to that of the rays I have mentioned; that in others, as in the genus Scyllium, the gland is wanting, and its place is sup- plied by a sac, (one for each organ,) situated under the common integument of the lower part of the abdomen, communicating by a narrow elongated passage, with the appendage; and containing a fluid slightly viscid,* probably secreted by follicles situated between the fibrous inner coat and its outer muscular one. This structure, I am informed by Dr. Andrew Smith, who, it would appear, first ob- served it, occurs in every species of the genus; and as in one specimen, that of the Scyllium Edwardii, the gland is not to be found, (we carefully sought for it together,) it is probably deficient in the others. 7.— Concluding Remarks. As in the torpedo, the common ray, the thorn- back, and the spotted ray, a tubular communication has been found to exist between the globular testes and the bodies hitherto called epididymides; as the fluid in the former was found to be similar to that of those canals—continuations of the epididymides which have commonly been considered as vasa de- ferentia; and as this fluid in its entozoa, possesses the essential character of a spermatic fluid; and lastly, as it could not be detected free in the cavity * According to Dr. Smith, the fluid contents are like very dilute white of egg.

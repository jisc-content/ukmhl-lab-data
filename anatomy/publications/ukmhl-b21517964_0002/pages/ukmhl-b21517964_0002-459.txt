It had the same character as that procured from the canal in the other speci- men, and abounded in animalcules in every respect similar, and like them in active motion. The anatomical examination in this instance afforded a result precisely similar to the preceding; a connection by means of tubuli was discovered between the head of the testis, and of the epididy- mis ; and no where else,—after very careful search. The whole of the generative organs with the urinary, associated with them, were removed entire;—and were immediately examined under spirit of wine. 4.—Of the Male Organs of the Spotted Rayy (R.

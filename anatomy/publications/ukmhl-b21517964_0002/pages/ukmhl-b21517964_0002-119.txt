ON THE BLOOD. 107 were mixed with an ounce of blood; partial coagu- lation presently took place; after twenty-four hours, a soft crassamentum formed, and pretty much fluid separated. Subjected to filtration, gentle pressure being used, some fibrin of soft consistence was col- lected. The filtered fluid coagulated weakly on dilution with water. After twenty-four hours, this portion was putrid: the undiluted had no unplea- sant smell; but it did not now coagulate with water. In a third experiment, twenty grains of nitre in powder were mixed with an ounce of blood, pre- viously deprived of its fibrin, by agitation with pieces of lead in a bottle, quite full of blood, and from which in consequence atmospheric air was ex- cluded. The colour of the blood became a little lighter, but rather of a brick-red hue than vermilion. Now on exposure to the air, at the surface it ac- quired a very florid scarlet hue, very similar to that imparted by oxygen. This thin coloured stratum subsided, and it was succeeded by another and another; till the whole mass exhibited a stratified appearanceâ€”a succession of bright and darker lines; analogous to what takes place in the cruor, similarly exposed without the addition of nitre, but less strongly marked.* * These results accord with those of Haller, as described by him in his Elementa Physiolog. ii. p. 74. After noticing the difference of opinion previously existing on the subject, whether nitre dissolves or coagulates the blood, he says, " A nitro sanguis neque solvitur, neque cogitur, in meis quidem experimentis. Admisto enim nitro laminae equidem cruoris floridissime rubenles nascuntur, verum ea?,

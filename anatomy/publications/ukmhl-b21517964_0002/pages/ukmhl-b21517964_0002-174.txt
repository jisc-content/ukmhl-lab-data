EXPERIMENTS ON THE BLOOD 102 Table showing the Absorption of Carbonic Acid Gas by Venous blood subjected to the air-pump. Volume of blood used. Volume of carbonic acid introduced. Volume of gas ab- sorbed. 27 46 38 27 45 39 27 46 35 Venous blood not subjected to the air-pump. Volume of blood used. Volume of gas in- troduced. Volume of gas ab- sorbed. 27 47 37 27 45 39 27 45 34 Although I have thought it right to notice these results, and although they are in accordance with the preceding, I do not attach value to them, excepting as tending to show that the quantity of carbonic acid gas extracted by the air-pump, when the blood affords it in vacuo, is small. The same mode of reasoning suggested compara- tive trials of the absorbent power of arterial blood for oxygen, before and after exhaustion by the air- pump, as a further test experiment, whether arterial blood contain oxygen in a free state, that is, admit-

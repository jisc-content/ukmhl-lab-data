AIR ON DEAD ANIMAL MATTER. 347 the surface, varied from 78° to 90°. Where the low temperature was observable, there it was tran- quil and without larvae ; where the temperature was high, there larvae abounded and were in great activity,—the space they occupied was surrounded by a margin of froth, the ammoniacal odour was strong, and the portion was becoming of a blackish hue and liquid. The experiment was then interrupted by the exclusion of air. On the following day the larva? appeared dead, and the temperature had fallen to that of the water. On the 2d August, atmospheric air was re-admitted. The temperature of the whole, never again exceeded that of the water perceptibly, though it did partially, as in por- tions where larvae were collected feeding, and where froth was produced: thus, on the 6th August, whilst the surface in general was covered with a greyish byssus, and was only at the temperature of the water, in one spot about an inch in diameter it was 6° higher, and there in the midst of froth, there was a brood of larvae rapidly growing and eagerly feeding. On the 27th August, the whole presented the appearance of an inky fluid, of the temperature of the water, and strongly ammoniacal, apparently deriving its black colour from carbonaceous matter liberated and suspended, mixed with particles of cellular tissue, and at the bottom with shreds of pleura and fragments of vessels, which became ap- parent on washing.

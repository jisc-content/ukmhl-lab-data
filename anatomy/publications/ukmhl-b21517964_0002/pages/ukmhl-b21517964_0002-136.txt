124 MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS Let us first consider the appearances and qualities of the blood, which are commonly supposed to be indicative of inflammation, and to warrant rather than forbid further blood-letting. They are chiefly the following :—an unusual degree of fluidity of the blood, the instant it is drawn ; unusual slowness in coagulating; and, when coagulated, being covered with a buffy coat and cupped. Relative to these appearances and qualities of blood, experience seems to show, that they are met with in the majority of cases of local inflammation, but with shades, differences, and exceptions, involv- ing much difficulty and perplexity. 1. When the inflammation is violent, rapidly run- ning on to suppuration, and very extensive, as attack- ing at the same time more than one texture,—or only the same texture, but in different organs,—the blood drawn, I have observed, is neither buffed nor cupped. This I have witnessed most strikingly, in cases of peritoneal inflammation, either pure or com- plicated, with inflammation of the mucous coat of the intestines, or with diffuse cellular inflammation. 2. In diffuse cellular inflammation, I have often noticed that the blood coagulated rapidly, as rapidly as in health, and yet being unusually liquid, exhibit- ed a slight buffy coat,—provided, as has been already mentioned, the vessel used for holding it, was filled in a few seconds, and instantly put aside and allowed to remain undisturbed. 3. In ordinary cases of inflammation, as of the

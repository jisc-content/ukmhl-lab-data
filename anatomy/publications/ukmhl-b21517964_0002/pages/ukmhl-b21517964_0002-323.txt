TEXTURES OF THE HUMAN BODY. 311 idea naturally occurred, that other textures of ani- mals besides the cutis, might be subjected advan- tageously to the process of tanning for various uses. It seemed not improbable that some parts might be useful in the form of tubes, as the intestines, thus converted into leather. Farther, it seemed highly probable, that the art of tanning might be applied to the making of certain anatomical prepara- tions, in a dry state, for the purpose of public de- monstration, and that it might also be turned to account in the art of embalming. The few experi- ments which I have hitherto made in relation to these applications, are as favourable as could be ex- pected, and make me sanguine, that whoever un- dertakes to push them farther, and give them a fair trial, will be eminently successful. Some prepara- tions which I have made of the larger blood-vessels and of the intestines, display their parts perfectly in a dry state, and when immersed in water and distended by the absorption of this fluid, they even display very well the different coats of which they are formed. I suspect that, anciently in Egypt, tannin was employed in embalming. Some years ago, I recollect having examined a heart, and the fluid in which it was found preserved, in an alabas- ter vase, lined with a substance like petroleum. It had been brought, I believe, from Thebes, in Upper Egypt, and, if I am rightly informed, it is deposited by Dr. Bree, to whom it belonged, in the Museum of the College of Physicians of London. The

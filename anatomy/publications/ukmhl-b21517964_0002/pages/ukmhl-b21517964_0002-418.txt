406 ON MACERATION IN WATER OF to divide the tunica albuginea into two or more layers, but could not succeed. The vas deferens underwent change very like the tunica albuginea; its inner surface, near its termination, which is a reticulated structure, composed of fine tendon-like fibres, resisted disintegration longest. The vesi- culae seminales too underwent a very similar change, and their inner fibrous reticulated tissue also re- sisted change the longest. The Penis, (6. 7.)—On immersion, this organ became distended with water, especially the loose prepuce, and the cells of the corpora cavernosa, and spongiosa. At the temperature of about 60°; after maceration of eight days, the cuticle almost ceased to adhere, and might be detached most easily. I carefully traced it to the mouth of the urethra; about a line inside of the orifice it terminated, much in the same manner as the cuticle terminates in the anus, overlapping the membrane of the urethra. I have endeavoured to find an epithelium as a distinct membrane in the urethra continuous with the cuticle, but in vain ; nor have I succeeded in finding any villi in this canal. Few parts of the body resist maceration longer than the penis; and all its dif- ferent textures are in a very remarkable manner little liable to change, as its skin, its nerves, and vessels, the lining membrane of the urethra, and more especially its ligamentous sheath. Many months are required for the disintegration of any one of these parts; and some of them after twelve

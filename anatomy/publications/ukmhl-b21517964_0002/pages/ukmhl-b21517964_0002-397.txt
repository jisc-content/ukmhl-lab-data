DIFFERENT TEXTURES OF THE HUMAN BODY. 385 became soft, semi-transparent and depressed; there elevated and mucilaginous. In some places it was dis- coloured brown, in others greenish. Gradually it be- came extremely thin and worn into holes,—and the change continuing, it was reduced to shreds and par- ticles. Thoracic Duct, (8.)—It slowly underwent change like the vena cava. Nerves.—I have made but few observations on this subject, and these have been confined to the crural nerve (4.) Its theca gradually softened; in about two months the enveloping and connecting tissue constitut- ing the theca, was partially reduced to a brownish mu- cilaginous state, which was detached on the slightest friction, and then the nerve separated into its compo- nent filaments. These filaments slowly lost their strength, became as it were mucilaginous, and fell to pieces. Pia Mater, and Arachnoid Membrane, (11.)— The latter membrane in this instance was slightly opaque, and consequently the better fitted for obser- vation. In their change from maceration, the two membranes kept equal pace; they slowly lost their strength, in some places more so than in others; holes formed in them, which gradually increasing in number and size, in about two months reduced them to shreds. The small vessels ramifying through the pia mater, wasted and disappeared much before the larger ones; these latter remained to the last, but perforated, and undergoing the same kind of change as the membranes themselves.

EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS 20 cific gravity than the liquid mixture of red particles, serum, and coagulable lymph, and in consequence the former becomes supernatant. Before coagulation takes place, it is this comparatively dense fluid which supports the liquid fibrin, and when coagula- tion has occurred the substratum of red particles enveloped in fibrin still gives support; and, the longer the coagulation is in taking place, so much the less fibrin is mixed with the red particles, so much the more rises or is pressed up, and, ccoteris paribus, so much the thicker the buffy coat becomes. In healthy blood, on the contrary, in which the serum and coagulable lymph are more viscid, the red particles are supported till coagulation takes place, and then are retained, like water in a sponge, and, like water, may be expressed from the sponge- like texture ; or, if in excess, a part of them will separate and fall down as the fibrin contracts. This view is in accordance with Hunter's well authenti- cated facts, confirmed as above. And, as another experimental confirmation of them, I may mention, that when fibrin, or a portion of buffy coat which sinks in serum, is plunged into the cruor of blood, it rises to the surface and floats, in accordance with their respective specific gravities. Relative to the second opinion, already referred to, that there is no difference of specific gravity between serum and lymph, it appears to me inadmiss- ible, simply because it is not in accordance with facts. The ingenious author of it seems to found the idea

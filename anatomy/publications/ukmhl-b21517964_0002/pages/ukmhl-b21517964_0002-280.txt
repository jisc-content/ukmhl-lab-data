268 ON THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY, ETC. already pointed out. The most striking difference between their results and mine, presents itself in the instance of the lungs: and I select it the rather for comment, as it affords illustration of one of the causes of difference. According to MM. Schubler and Kapff, the specific gravity of the substance of the lung is 645 to water as 1000 ;* according to the result obtained by me, 1054. I have stated that the specimen which I subjected to experiment was destitute of air: their specimen, of course con- tained air: and it follows, that as the air in the lung is in variable quantity, its specific gravity also, unless air be excluded, must be variable also. * Traite de Physiologie, torn. viii. p. 6.

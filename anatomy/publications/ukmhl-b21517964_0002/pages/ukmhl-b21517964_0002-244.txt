Rosa arteriam vivi animalis sanguine repletam in duobus locis ligaverat, quae exscissa et refrigerata volumen suum ad f diminuit, et sanguis hujus con- tracts arteriae filum referens tantum J3- diametri partem explevit ; ex quo sequitur, quod sanguinis volumen in arteria viva ad volumen sanguinis arteriae mortuae se ut 9 ad 1 habeat."* The vapour which Prochaska alludes to, it is hardly necessary to observe, can only have effect, and indeed can exist only, where there is free space, as in an artery not full of blood,—in the pleura or peritonaeum—not at every point in contact with their contents. If such a vapour as he supposes exist in the body, and if the results of Rosa's experiments quoted by him, are owing to its action, it might be expected to be of a peculiar kind, not merely aqueous vapour, but of some other fluid capable of becoming elastic, and of exerting a distending force at the ordinary temperature of the blood. I shall describe what I have witnessed in repeating the experiments, made with all the care I could use, to endeavour to satisfy myself on a point of very great interest, at least, thus hypothetically viewed. 1st Experiment.

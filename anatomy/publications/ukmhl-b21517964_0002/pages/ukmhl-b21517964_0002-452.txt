To this connection, of course, my attention was particularly directed. The appearances were most satisfactory : small tubes or ducts could be clearly seen passing from one to the other, and entering into the body of each. They were made perfectly apparent by minute dissection under water, and the the immersion of the organs in dilute sulphurous acid,—vide Fig. 2, (c) Plate I. 2.— Of the Male Organs of the Thornback (Rata clavata). On the 12th of October I had an opportunity under very favourable circumstances, of examining a male thornback of large size, shortly after being caught.

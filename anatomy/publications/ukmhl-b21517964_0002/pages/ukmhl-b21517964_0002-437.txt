THEORY OF MEMBRANES. 425 lures; as for instance, that of the middle coat of arteries,â€”some considering it analogous in nature to the substance of the muscles over which the will exercises no control, and in which the peculiar ar- rangement or appearance of fibres observable in the voluntary muscles under the microscope is not dis- tinguishable : others, holding it to be totally dif- ferent from muscular substance, neither irritable nor contractile, but elastic, and most analogous to elastic ligament, as the ligamentum nuchae. This difference of opinion has arisen out of various re- search, not carried sufficiently far; and is a good example of the state of our knowledge of the sub- ject of membranes generally, in which a no small number of points are open to question, and com- paratively few are fixed. Another example presents itself in mucous membranes, viewed in a different relation. It is yet undecided, whether or no the secretion from which they derive their principal cha- racteristic and their name, is solely the production of glandules or folicles dissiminated through their texture, or that of the submucous cellular tissue; or in part that of the membranes themselves inde- pendent of such folicles or glandules. In a former section, namely, on the effects of boiling water, and of long continued boiling on animal textures, I have expressed the opinion, that the results detailed relative to the white membranes and fibrous parts, seemed to me rather in favour of Haller's early view of them, than of the later and

MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS 100 became very dark and viscid, in consistence like thick bile. There was only a very slight subsidence of the red particles. On dilution with water, it did not coagulate. The portion diluted after three days, in November, was putrid: the undiluted por- tion was free from taint. Common salt: two drachms of this salt in powder were mixed with two ounces of blood. Examined a few hours after, the blood was found thickened, but not distinctly coagulated. After forty-eight hours, it was much in the same state. Passed through a linen filter, no fibrin remained. Diluted with about four times its bulk of water it coagulated and formed a gelatinous mass. In another experiment, 20 grains of common salt were mixed with an ounce of blood. It prevented coagulation: and the colour of the blood was im- mediately brightened. After twenty-four hours the blood was found viscid and dark. Filtered through linen, no fibrin was collected. It jellied with water. After six days, in November, the diluted portion had become putrid; the other not, and retained its power of coagulating on admixture with water. Saltpetre: mixed two drachms of this salt with two ounces of blood; after a few hours the blood was found thickened. Passed through a linen filter, a minute portion of very soft fibrin was collected ; after forty-eight hours, the filtered portion jellied with water. In another experiment, 20 grains of this salt

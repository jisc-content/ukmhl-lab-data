These are the circumstances on which he founds his opinion, and comes to the conclusion, " Si Pro- chaska n'a point vu de bulles s'en elever lorsqu'il les ouvrait sous l'eau, il faut que quelque erreur d'ob- servation se soit glissee dans cette experience." Theoretically viewed, especially taking into ac- count the great difficulty with which air is separated (when it is possible) from the blood, by the air- pump, and never, as far as I have observed, in its vessels,â€”this conclusion of Professor Burdach is open to many doubts; doubts which are not re- moved by his after reflections. The question is necessarily one of difficulty, as well as of much physiological interest in relation to its bearings; and, of a nature, as it appears to me, admitting of solution only by accurate and strict ob- servation independent of speculative views. If it is a fact, that the arteries contain air after death, and * Traite de Phvsiologie considered commc Science d'Observaiion. Traduit par A. Jourdan. Tom. vi. p. 285.

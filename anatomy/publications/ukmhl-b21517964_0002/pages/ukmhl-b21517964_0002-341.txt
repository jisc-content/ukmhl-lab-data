TEXTURES OF THE HUMAN BODY. 329 Farther on I shall have occasion to recur to this subject. When engaged in this inquiry, I had intended to investigate more in detail the effects of coction, and I commenced making observations on the com- parative tendency to putrefaction of the textures subjected to the boiling process. From the partial trials then made, it appeared, that all those parts which were much softened and gelatinized by boiling, had become by the change much disposed to pu- trefy. It was remarkably the case in the instance of tendon, cartilage, and fibrous membrane. After being boiled, they underwent the putrid liquefac- tion even more readily than muscle : the effects in these instances, as in muscle, liver, lung, spleen, &c. in which, at least in the majority, there appeared to be an augmentation of specific gravity, rather than a diminution, was less clear: and I am doubtful, whether, the coction really increased or diminished the putrefactive tendency. A few experiments about the same time were made, on the fitness of boiling, as an aid in the pre- servation of anatomical preparations. The result was favourable, shewing that those parts, which con- tain much blood, and which are themselves but little altered by a short application of the boiling tempera- ture, may immediately be put into spirit of wine, and kept without its being necessary to change it. Thus, in February 1829, a portion of blood coagulated by heat, â€” a portion of liver and spleen, merely in-

410 ON MACERATION IN WATER OF increases. Various bones, after having been under observation twelve months, had not lost the whole of their animal matter, not even the most delicate, as the fine plates of the ethmoid, and the spongy structure of the turbinated bone. Intervertebral substance.—I know of no part of the body so little changed by maceration as this. Portions of it from different bodies, which had been in water from eight to twelve months, retained their form, were very little altered in appearance, and had lost little of their substance. The central soft part, almost of gelatinous consistence in the recent sub- ject, was the part chiefly affected; it, in the time mentioned, had principally wasted and disappeared. The outer layers, on the contrary, suffered least; after twelve months they retained, as well as I could judge, their original firmness; and when the minute quantity of mucus-like substance which had formed on their surface was washed off, they exhibited their original colour. 4.— General Remarks and Conclusions. The changes produced by maceration, or during the process, are referrible, I believe, to three dis- tinct causes. 1st, To chemical causes, giving rise to new combinations of the component elements, and to new productions with the aid of the oxygen dissolved in the water. 2dly, To insects,—those which constitute the family of Infusoria of Linnseus, (many

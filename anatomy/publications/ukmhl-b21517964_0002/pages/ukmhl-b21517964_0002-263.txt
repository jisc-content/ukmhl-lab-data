251 AND FLUID IN THE PERICARDIUM. gical inquirer. I apprehend, that if no colouring matter of the blood is found mixed with a fluid in a closed serous cavity, it may fairly be inferred, that it was secreted during life; that if the colouring matter of the blood be found intermixed, especially in solution, the inference must be drawn that an exudation has taken place, the amount of which may perhaps be measured with tolerable accuracy by the quantity of colouring matter. The solution in the serum of the blood of the colouring matter belonging to the red particles is connected with putrid decomposition, and is one of the first indications of it. The permeability of mem- branes, if not another effect of the same change, is, I am satisfied, greatly increased by it. This is very manifest from the inspection of bodies at different intervals after death, and at different seasons of the year: I believe it may be laid down as a rule that the circumstances favourable to putrefaction, are equally so, to permeability and exudation.* * The difference of effect is well shewn in the instance of the urinary bladder. On the 27th of September, when the weather was cool, water, urine, and cruor of blood, were respectively put into sheeps' bladders, quite fresh, and suspended in jars, covered from the air. For three hours not a drop of either fluid had passed through; after twenty-four hours, a small quantity of each was found in the receivers, and the serum was coloured red, and even contained red particles. Through a bladder, allowed to become putrid, water passes as through coarse filtering paper. The same effect of putri- dity, in increasing permeability, is strongly marked in the leather made in warm and in cold climates. In the former, where it is diffi- cult to arrest the putrefactive process, the leather is in a high degree

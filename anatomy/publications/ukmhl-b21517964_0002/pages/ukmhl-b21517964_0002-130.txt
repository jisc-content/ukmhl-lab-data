118 MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS with mucus, destitute of life, occasionally firmly encrusts the teeth. Dead bone, it has recently been found, may be united to living bone; a union may take place by a deposit of new bony matter, con- necting the two, so that, were it not known that the added bone was dead, it might be inferred to be alive.* Moreover, we know, that foreign bodies have often continued enveloped in living parts, as a ball in a limb, as if they were not foreign bodies, occasioning no pain, no irritation, no morbid action. Very recently, a patient was admitted into the General Hospital, at Fort Pitt, after amputation of his fore- arm on account of a malignant tumour. The stump was cicatrized, but the ligatures employed in securing the vessels had not come away. About four months after the operation he died, exhausted from the effects of the malignant disease which had broken out in the arm and shoulder. I examined the liga- tures ; they had been perfectly preserved, enclosed in the cicatrix, as if they had been living parts, indicating demonstratively that lymph had been thrown out around, and that it had adhered to them. The hairs, nail, cuticle, and enamel of the teeth are products from living parts, and all of them may be considered as organized ; but they are not generally considered as alive, and yet how little do they differ * Vide Transactions of Medico-Chirurgical Society of London, vol. xix, for a notice of this curious fact by Mr. Gulliver; and also the 3d Fasciculus of Drawings, selected from the Museum of Morbid Anatomy, at Fort Pitt.

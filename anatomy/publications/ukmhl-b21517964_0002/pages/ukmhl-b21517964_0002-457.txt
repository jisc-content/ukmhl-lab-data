OF THE CARTILAGINOUS FISHES. 445 globular, milt-like part bordering the globular testis. It abounded in thick opaque fluid, of which a suffi- cient quantity was collected for examination by gentle pressure. Under the microscope, it was found to contain a large number of globules, of about the size and general appearance of pus- globules, a few very much smaller, and a few ani- malcules, less distinctly formed than those in the globular portion, and in the vas deferens, but clearly of the like kind. The anatomical examination of the organs was next entered on. I have stated that at first view they appeared generally not to differ from those of the thornback ; a minute inspection confirmed this. A tubular connexion was found between the head of each testis and epididymis, not admitting of doubt; the tubuli were traced from the globular substance into the mass of the epididymis. On the 24th of November, another fish of this species was procured, in which also the male organs were in a very favourable state for examination, and which were examined with great care, having in view the doubtful points. No fluid in this instance was contained in the ab- dominal cavity ; not a single drop could be col- lected. As the globular and the milt-like testis, both of this ray and of the thornback, are connected with the epididymis, by a delicate peritoneal covering,â€” enveloping the whole of them, leaving a cavity be- tween the testis and epidydimis, which descends

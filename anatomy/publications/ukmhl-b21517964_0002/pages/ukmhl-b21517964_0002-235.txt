OTHER SECRETIONS, AND ON SOLID PARTS. 223 2.— OfBile. Recently I have subjected, with all possible care, the bile of the ox, the sheep, and the pig, to the air-pump. As soon as the animal was killed, a liga- ture was applied to the cystic duct, and the gall- bladder was dissected out. In the instance of the ox, the bladder was immersed in water, and brought to me, and the bile, within a quarter of an hour, was received into water that had been deprived of air ; in that of the sheep the transfer was made on the spot; but in that of the pig it was delayed about fourteen hours. In each instance, no air could be extricated by exhaustion; the results were most satisfactory,—not a particle appeared. On the bile of man, I have recently made only one trial, conducted in the same manner as the preceding ; it was procured from a body, examined twenty hours after death, in the beginning of May, that had died of tubercular phthisis, complicated with paraplegia, occasioned by the growth of a tumour of the medullary kind in the lower part of the spinal canal. Although a cavity in the lungs was in a gan- grenous state, the blood bore no marks of incipient putrefaction ; and not a particle of air was disen- gaged from the bile in vacuo. In Corfu, I made a similar trial of cystic bile, in two other fatal cases, both of chronic dysentery, with conduces powerfully to its fermentation—to the formation of carbonic acid and vinegar, and the separation of its curd and cream.

17 ON THE lU.OOl). particles which may be considered as passive, in a manner, rather than active * The circumstances or qualities alluded to, belonging to the lymph, are its coagulating more slowly than in healthy blood, and its possessing greater tenuity or liquidity, not only than lymph in its healthy state, but even than serum; in consequence of which the red particles more readily subside, and the lymph coagulating, free from the presence of colouring matter, appears colourless, constituting the buffy coat. Of late years, this view .of Hewson's relative to the formation of the buffy coat, has commonly been only partiallv adopted, and the circumstance, viz. the slowness of coagulation, which he held to be least important, has been most insisted on, and has been considered most essential. Even Professor Muller is not an exception in this respect; in his Elements of Physiology, f he enumerates as the principal causes * As the serum of the blood and its red particles appear to be subject to some variations, they may occasionally in a minor degree influence the production or prevention of a buffy coat. The serum is naturally in a certain degree viscid ; an increase of this quality, caeteris paribus, would retard or prevent the appearance of the buffy coat, and vice versa. The red particles are naturally of comparatively high specific gravity, owing to which they rapidly subside, in a fluid of no or of little viscidity ; any diminution of this quality, whether from expansion of the corpuscles, as from a kind of dropsical state, or from greater buoyancy from adhering particles of air, also, ceteris paribus, would have a similar retarding or preventing effect on the formation of a buffy coat; but, let me remark, these are hypothetical considerations. t Elements of Physiology, part i. p. 117, translated by Dr. Baly.

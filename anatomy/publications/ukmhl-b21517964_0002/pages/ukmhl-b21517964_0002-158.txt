146 EXPERIMENTS ON THE BLOOD atmospheric pressure, the absorption of gas ex- ceeds the volume of the fluid, both in the instance of blood and serum. The results of some experi- ments are exhibited in the following Table. The majority of them were obtained between a tempera- ture of 40° and 45°; the three last at about 51°. When the venous and arterial blood, and the serum tried, were from the same animal, the num- bers expressing the results are entered in the same line.

OTHER SECRETIONS, AND ON SOLID PARTS. 233 a sheep, on the 10th May, when the temperature of the air was about 60Â°; the 8th nerve was separated from the artery. Applied loosely two ligatures to the exposed part; the superior was first drawn tight; there was no apparent increase of the volume of the vessel below. Immediately after tying tightly the lower one, the included space was measured by a compass and found to be exactly 1*50 inch, and the diameter of the included vessel -20 inch. The part was now cut out; the artery was first divided above the superior ligature; blood flowed moderately as from a vein from the open extremity; it was next divided below, when the blood gushed out with violence. The portion removed was again imme- diately measured; its diameter was not perceptibly changed; but, in length from 1*50 inch, it was con- tracted to 1*20. It was instantly placed in water purged of air by the air-pump; and about an hour after, placed under a receiver for exhaustion. On exhausting the receiver, I narrowly watched the artery; but could not perceive the slightest disten- sion of it, such as might be expected if it contained any fluid more volatile than water; nor did any take place when the vacuum was as complete as it could be made. Measured again, now it was quite cold, and after having been taken out of the water, its diameter appeared unaltered, but its length a little increased, namely to T30 inch.

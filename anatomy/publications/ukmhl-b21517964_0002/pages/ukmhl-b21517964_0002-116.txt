MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS 104 three hours the blood with which it was mixed was liquid and its colour unchanged. After twenty- four hours, the colouring matter had subsided, the supernatant fluid was like serum, it did not jelly. Magnesia and carbonate of magnesiaâ€”15 grains of each in impalpable powder were mixed with half an ounce of blood. The blood in each instance acquired a more florid hue, remained liquid, and the red particles subsided. On the following day, viz. the 19th January at Corfu, the supernatant fluid, had the appearance of serum. Now, diluted with water, after twenty-four hours, in the" instance of the carbonate it was found to have jellied ; and in that of the magnesia, to have afforded a precipitate of lymph in a flaky form. Cream of tartar: a drachm of this salt was added to an ounce of blood. The blood thickened a little and effervesced slightly, and became of a brighter red. After three hours it had not coagulated. After twenty-four hours the red particles had subsided; the supernatant fluid was like serum. On dilution with water it jellied; the coagulum was of a very soft consistence. Chloride of barium : 12 grains of this salt were mixed with an ounce of blood. After five minutes, it remained liquid; the colour of the blood was perhaps a little brighter. After twenty-four hours, there was a slight subsidence of red particles and separation of fluid. It was a little thicker, but still liquid. With water it jellied.

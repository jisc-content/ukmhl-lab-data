DIFFERENT TEXTURES OF THE HUMAN BODY. 393 mer prevailing most at and towards the apex, and the latter most towards the base, and round the foramen ccecum, and in the anterior part sur- mounted by papilla?, which, minutely examined, themselves appeared to be bundles of fibres. These papilla?, and this fibrous and cellular tissue slowly underwent a change very like that described when treating of the dura mater, skin, &c. (Esophagus, (7. 9.)â€”In the inferior part of the oesophagus, and especially just at its termination, an outer membrane or epithelium, somewhat similar to that of the mouth was (as it generally is) distinct; and it separated in the same manner. Higher up it became very indistinct; and I was not able to trace it in a satisfactory manner in the upper portion, and through the pharynx, where, as I have already ob- served, its appearance is obscure, and its existence often doubtful. During continued maceration, the muscular coat of the oesophagus first disappeared. The inner or mucous coat gradually became soft and corroded. In about two months in winter, its upper part was reduced to shreds, which, stretched under water, had the silky lustre, and general ap- pearance of cellular tissue, or of very delicate fib- rous structure. The lower part was stronger, and resisted disintegration a little longer. The sub- mucous tissue also resisted it a little longer; ulti- mately it was reduced to the same kind of debris, composed of fibres and altered particles discoloured brown.

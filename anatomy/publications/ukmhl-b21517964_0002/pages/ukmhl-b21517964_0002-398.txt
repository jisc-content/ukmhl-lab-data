386 ON THE MACERATION IN WATER OF Theca Spinalis, (8.) —It underwent change slowly. In about six weeks it presented a very varied appearance ; in some places eroded as it were, and become very thin ; in others, holes had formed ; close to them there was a conversion into transpa- rent spots ; and generally there was a fibrous vege- table growth adhering to the surface from which it had sprung. The same kind of change gradually proceeding, the membrane was reduced to shreds, and these ultimately to particles of a fawn colour easily suspended in water. Dura Mater, (2. 3. 4. 10.)—This membrane, during the first two or three weeks, did not appear to undergo any change. Gradually its surface became slimy, either with or without discoloration, but more frequently the latter. In different speci- mens, the discoloration was very various, as bright- blue, brown, orange, red and greenish. A wasting of the substance of the dura mater attended the formation of the slime, or soft mucilage-like matter; and, being washed off as it successively formed, the membrane became very thin and corroded into holes. The change proceeded very irregularly. The wasting was chiefly confined to particular spots, as so many centres of action, the adjoining por- tions remaining little altered for a long time, and having their strength but little impaired. In these portions thus exempted in a manner from rapid alteration, the structure of the tissue was well dis- played,—the very delicate connecting fibres yielding

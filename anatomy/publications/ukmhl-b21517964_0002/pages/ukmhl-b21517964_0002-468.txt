ON THE MALE ORGANS 456 spermatic animalcules are developed; and perhaps in the globular portion they grow and are matured. The microscopical observations described are rather in favour of this idea.* If the view which I have taken of the function of the testes and of the epididymides be received, the structure of the subordinate generative parts within the cavity of the abdomen will, I believe, be found to be perfectly in accordance and to offer fresh evidence in favour of its correctness: I now allude to the vasa deferentia,—and the part or parts inferiorly connected with them. The vasa deferentia, in all the rays which have been noticed, are similar, and well adapted both to conduct and hold in reserve such a fluid as the sper- matic,—for they are comparatively large, and are * The spermatic fluid of the milt of the bony fishes, hears some resemblance to the fluid of the milt-like portion of the testes of the rays mentioned. I have examined it in the herring, smelt, cod, dab, pike, and salmon; in the three first, it appeared minutely glo- bular ; in the dab, many of the particles had two opposite delicate filaments, and in the pike one. MM. Dumas and Prevost state that the spermatic animalcules of all the fishes they had examined are filamentous,—and that the filamentous part had escaped observation previously on account of its great tenuity; an opinion I can readily adopt, as I could per- ceive the prolongations of the animalcules of the dab and pike, only when in a very favourable light, and by means of nice adjustment. What the species of fishes were, examined by these gentlemen, is not noticed; their remark on the subject is made incidentally in their ingenious memoir on the spermatic animalcules of many of the ver- tebrata already quoted, with the promise to give the details on a future occasion.

Ill ON THE BLOOD. and the serum of the blood. The effect is pro- duced almost instantaneously, excepting in the in- stances of sulphurous acid and barytes, — and is generally attended with a change of colour of the red particles. Neither the sulphurous acid gas, nor its aqueous solution, nor barytes, has any perceptible immediate effect, except that of darkening the blood; but, in a few hours, both the acid and barytes, as might be expected from their operation on serum, render it of firm consistence like strong jelly. The blood used in all the experiments, the results of which have been given, when not specially men- tioned, was venous blood, taken chiefly from men in the prime of life, or but little beyond it, labouring under various diseases. I have not considered it necessary to specify the nature of these diseases, or the peculiarities of the blood in each instance,—the object of my inquiry being, on the present occasion, totally different from the investigation of the pro- perties of this fluid in a morbid state. It may be proper, at the same time, to notice, that disease was not lost sight of,—and that in such experiments, in which it was desirable to use healthy blood, the blood employed was from men labouring under slight com- plaints, or just attacked with severe ones, and a por- tion of it was always set aside, undisturbed, for com- parison.

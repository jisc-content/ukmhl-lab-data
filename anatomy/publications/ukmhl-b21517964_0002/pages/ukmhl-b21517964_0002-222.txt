210 OBSERVATIONS ON THE BLOOD bonic acid gas,—proving that there was an excess of this acid in the blood. This excess, I am dis- posed to infer, especially from the results of experi- ments which I have made on healthy blood, as already mentioned, is the effect of disease, and is particularly apt to take place, as before remarked, in the act of dying, when the powers of secretion seem to be arrested, and carbonic acid probably ceases to be eliminated in the lungs. In ac- cordance with this, is the uniform dark colour of the blood, which is usually observed after death, and equally in the left and in the right ventricle of the heart; and also the little suffering, fortunately, com- monly witnessed in dying,—stupor, or coma, usually preceding and ushering in the fatal event. From the results referred to, and from a few which I have obtained in operating on blood, taken from persons labouring under disease, I am disposed to think that carbonic acid acts a very important part in the economy of life, and is connected, when in excess, if not with the production of particular diseases, at least with their modification and progress, and the production of certain symptoms,—and that the care- ful examination of the blood, in relation to this acid, is an inquiry much wanted, and is likely to reward richly those who engage in it. At present there is a great difference of opinion, derived from experi- ment, respecting the carbonic acid in the blood : some inquirers, as Dr. Stevens, to whom belongs the merit of having opened this path of research,

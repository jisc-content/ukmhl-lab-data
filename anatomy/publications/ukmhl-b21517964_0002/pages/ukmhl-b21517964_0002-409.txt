DIFFERENT TEXTURES OF THE HUMAN BODY. 3Q7 were as distinct as at first, and not perceptibly weakened. The appearance of the inner surface of these channels bore a strong resemblance to the sinuses of the dura mater; and their general pro- perties, and the manner in which they long resisted decomposition, and the manner in which they very gradually yielded to it, confirmed the analogy. After thirty-five days, neither the hepatic, nor the cystic, nor the common duct, nor a portion of the pan- creatic duct attached, was altered, except very slightly; the lancet-shaped processes above alluded to were gradually wearing away. The cellular, or cellular-fibrous tissue enveloping the gall bladder and duct had become very soft; yet when stretched under water, its fibres had the peculiar tendinous lustre and appearance. The inner reticulated sur- face of the gall-bladder still retained its orange hue ; in many places it was of mucous consistence, or reduced to a slime-like state. After fifty-four days, the ducts exactly resembled the dura mater; the lancet-shaped processes were still distinguish- able ; the gall bladder had lost almost entirely its inner reticulated surface, â€” that commonly called its mucous coat; and there remained little but a tissue of fibres, which when stretched under water had a silky lustre like tendinous fibres, and retained a greenish yellow tinge of bile. After about three months there was little further alteration, and even after four no very considerable one; the ducts gra- dually wasted like the dura mater; a mucus-like

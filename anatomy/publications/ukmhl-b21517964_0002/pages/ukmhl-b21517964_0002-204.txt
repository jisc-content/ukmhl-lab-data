192 OBSERVATIONS ON THE BLOOD The fatal cases, affording the subjects of these observations were, without exception, soldiers of our regiments, serving in Malta, composed of En- glishmen, Scotch, and Irish. In the cool season, the bodies were commonly inspected in from twelve to seventeen hours after death ; in the hot season, in from three to twelve. As the table is brought forward chiefly as an ex- ample, intended to shew how various is the con- dition of the blood after death, I shall restrict myself to a very few remarks on the different appearances of the blood noticed, and especially in connexion with the fatal diseases. To do justice to the subject, it would be necessary to enter into very minute details, and give a statement of particulars, which could be collected only by laborious research,â€”and which, at present, I am not at all prepared to offer. 1. The few instances in which the heart was found empty, or containing only a very minute quantity of blood, were chiefly cases of death from ruptured aneurism. 2. The instances in which the blood was found liquid and not coagulable on exposure to the air, the fatal event, in the majority of cases, was re- ferrible to the respiratory organs, and was owing either to drowning, hanging, the fumes of a charcoal fire, or the effusion of blood into the bronchia or air-cells. The former occurred in a case of pneu- monia; the latter in two cases of sudden death, from what Laennec has called pulmonary apoplexy.

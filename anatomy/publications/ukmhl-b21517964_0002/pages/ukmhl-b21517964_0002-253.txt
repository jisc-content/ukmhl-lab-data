AND FLUID IN THE PERICARDIUM. 241 their having taken place after the cessation of vital action. It is too well known to be insisted on, that, large portions of fluid may accumulate in the peri- cardium, and even in the ventricles of the brain, without a single symptom indicative of the occur- rence. These remarks were written in 1822, and were published in the Philosophical Transactions for that year. Referring to an able work on Physiology, now in progress of publication by Professor Bur- dach, I perceive that this ingenious inquirer and learned author objects to the results of my experi- ments, on account of the pericardium having been exposed to the pressure of the atmosphere, which, he is of opinion, would arrest the exudation, "le pericarde ayant 6te ouvert et expose a la pression de 1' atmosphere, la secretion ne pouvait plus s'y ac- complir."* This objection appears to me rather specious than well founded. It is true that the air is excluded from closed sacs, such as the pleurae and pericardium; but I do not believe that the pressure of the atmosphere is prevented, inasmuch as atmo- spheric air can enter through the aspera arteria into the lungs, and through the medium of them, act on the pericardium or pleurae,—yielding membranes, and ordinarily in contact with the organs which they contain,—and consequently not offering any true * Traite de Physiologie considered comme Science d'Observation, par C.

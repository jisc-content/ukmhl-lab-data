OBSERVATIONS ON PUS. 468 quantity of purulent fluid can be employed for pro- curing it; for the concrete part, the globules, and the liquid part, cannot be separated by filtration, owing to the viscid quality of the latter; and owing to the same quality, the globules on rest subside very slowly, and rarely leave the supernatant fluid per- fectly transparent; the supernatant fluid, under the microscope, is commonly found to contain globules, the majority of them smaller than the ordinary pus- globules, and of a form less uniformly regular. 3. —As might be expected, pus freezes less readily than water. In the winter of 1811, I exposed some pus from an abscess, to the open air over night, when the temperature was several degrees below 32°. On the following morning, it had an appearance not unlike that of frozen milk, semi-hard, easily broken, composed of large thin plates, with fluid intermixed, arranged vertically. On thawing, the pus did not recover its original properties. Previously it was not viscid, excepting in a very slight degree ; now it had become so distinctly, and was slightly ropy. It was also partially coagulated; and it mixed less readily with water. 4. —Certain fluids, mixed with pus, have the effect of rendering it viscid, like mucus. Solution of potash and soda, and ammonia, act thus in a remark- able manner, and a solution of muriate of ammonia and other neutral salts act similarly, but in a less degree. These are facts which have been long known. Two views have been taken of the effect.

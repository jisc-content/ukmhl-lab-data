It is an inter- esting and important question, what becomes of the spirit taken into the stomach. Should other ex- periments confirm the above, the unavoidable infer- ence seems to be, that it is decomposed.* 8.â€” Observations on the Formation of the Buffy Coat of the Blood. In the preceding pages, I have endeavoured to shew, first, that there is no necessary connexion between the buff on the blood, and the specific gravity of that fluid ; and, secondly, that there is no necessary connexion between the quantity of fibrin in the blood, and its tendency to exhibit the buffy coat. The circumstances, or qualities, on which the formation of the buffy coat depends are, I believe, chiefly those so sagaciously and ingeniously pointed out by Hewson, and principally confined to the coagu- lable lymph, little dependent on the serum and red * Recently, I am informed, in instances of death from alcohol, either taken hy men in excessive quantity, or introduced into the stomach of animals, it has been detected in the blood, but in a larger proportion in the brain.

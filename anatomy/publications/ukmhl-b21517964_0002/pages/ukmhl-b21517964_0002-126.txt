114 MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS fluid, every function is interrupted, every organ soon ceases to act, and the part, or parts, or whole, almost immediately die ? Again, is it possible to conceive, that a fluid which belongs only to animals, which is generated in them from its elements, which can exist in them only under ordinary circumstances, changing its cha- racter the instant it is abstracted, without absorb- ing, or evolving any thing sensible or cognizable " in quo (as Harvey forcibly and eloquently states) vegetativae et sensitive operationes primo elucent: cui calor, primarium et immediatum animae instru- mentum, innascitur: qui corporis animae que com- mune vinculum est: et quo vehiculo anima omnibus totius corporis partibus influit."* Is it possible to conceive that this is a dead fluid ? In opposition to this view, it may be replied ; it is only a little more difficult to conceive the blood dead, than the chyle, and the chyle than the chyme. The food is admitted to be dead ; yet it is grateful to the palate, and certainly not injurious to the gullet and stomach, and whole primes vies. From it chyme is formed. May not chyme, in relation to the duodenum, act the part of the food in relation to the stomach, and like the food be dead ? Chyle is supposed to be derived, or formed from chyme; and, may not-it act on the parts with which it comes in contact, like the food on the stomach, and the chyme on the duodenum, and be considered also * Op. omnia, p. 398.

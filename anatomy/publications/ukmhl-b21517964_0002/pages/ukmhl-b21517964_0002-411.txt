DIFFERENT TEXTURES OF THE HUMAN BODY. 399 brane of the trachea, most remarkably in the back or membranous part of the canal, and I believe from the same cause, namely softening and disinte- gration of the mucous glandules, situated in the tissue next to the lining membrane, and communicating by ducts or pores with this membrane. At this time the muscles of the windpipe, and the thyroid gland were in a poultaceous state; but the inner mem- brane of the larynx still remained apparently un- altered. On the fifty-ninth day, the membrane of the epiglottis had almost entirely disappeared; its cartilage was full of perforations, and its margin was much worn and had become soft. The lining membrane of the larynx was here and there slightly eroded, as if ulcerated. When a portion of it was dissected off, and stretched under water, it had the appearance of a fibrous membrane. The chordae vocales retained their original appearance ; and their strength was not apparently decreased. The inner membrane of the trachea had nearly disap- peared ; the shreds of it which remained had also the character of fibrous membrane when stretched under water, although extremely delicate. The back portion of the lining membrane had most distinctly this character, and it had now acquired a cribriform texture, from the many cavities formed in it. Of the changes which successively took place after the fifty-ninth day, I have not any notes. I may remark generally from recollection of observations made on other specimens, that the chordae vocales, the lining

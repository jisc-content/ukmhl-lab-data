364 ON THE AGENCY OF ATMOSPHERIC the idea of putrefaction, the contents of the stomach are generally acrid; and the acidity diminishes almost gradually from the stomach to the rectum. Ammoniacal salts do indeed exist in the stomach and intestines; but in a healthy state, I am not. aware, that ammonia, or the carbonate of ammonia has ever been detected in these organs; and con- sequently, the principal product of putrefaction is found wanting.* Moreover, putridity seems to be corrected in the stomach, and its natural progress stopped. I shall not lay stress on meat introduced in a putrid state into the stomach, having been taken out after a time free from taint, as it may be said, that the putrid particles may have been destroyed, modified or removed, as happens when tainted meat is placed in a saccharine fluid in a state of fermenta- tion. I would rather adduce the fact, which I have witnessed, that muscle which has been in the stomach some time, when taken out and exposed to the atmosphere, does not putrefy more rapidly, but in a remarkable manner resists putrefaction. The substance or matter derived from muscular fibre, undergoing the putrefactive change, is indeed not unlike chyme in appearance, whether viewed with the naked eye, or with the microscope,—both of • This, it may be said, is owing to the presence of a stronger acid, such as the muriatic, which seems to be, from the experiments of Dr. Prout, an active agent in digestion, and which of course, if free, would unite with any free ammonia formed; so far weakening the above argument.

188 EXPERIMENTS ON THE BLOOD The results of the examination in the nineteen cases included in the First Table, were, as far as the artery was concerned, entirely negative ; not a single particle of air could be observed, in any instance, to escape from the vessel, opened under water. The artery, in every case, was collapsed; flattened ; its upper and under surface in contact, from atmospheric pressure,* and either quite destitute of blood, or it contained only a very minute portion, in the space of an inch, never equal to a single drop. And, in the instances of the vein, with one exception, that of case No. 3, the result was similar, strongly confirm- ing the absence of air. The trials, the results of which are given in the Second Table, were made for the sake of compari- son. I expected, that in every instance, air would be found in the artery as well as in the vein. The circumstance, that in three out of the eight cases in which the experiment was made, no air could be procured from the artery opened under water, â€” shews (to express the fact in popular language for the sake of brevity) how feeble is its power of suc- tion ; and how very inadequate, on the principle of removal of pressure, to draw air from the blood, according to the idea involved in the hypothetical view of Professor Burdach. As the results, which I have brought forward with- out selection, are perfectly in accordance with the * When opened, either in the air or under water, in every instance, it immediately recovered its cylindrical form, air or water entering.

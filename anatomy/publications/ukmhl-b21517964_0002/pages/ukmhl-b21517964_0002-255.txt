AND FLUID IN THE PERICARDIUM. 243 Experiment 1. Two hours after death from pulmonary consump- tion, the jugular vein of a body was opened,—six in the Philosophical Transactions for 1811, has noticed the results of some of his experiments, when engaged in some similar trials. He favoured me with a copy of his original notes, which, as they may interest the physiological reader, I shall introduce verbatim. His not being able to detect the salt in the blood, is explained by the results mentioned as obtained by Hering. It may be premised that the figures in the first column indicate the time when the salt was taken and the urine was tested.

After 15 minutes it was first detected in the urine, and it continued R 2

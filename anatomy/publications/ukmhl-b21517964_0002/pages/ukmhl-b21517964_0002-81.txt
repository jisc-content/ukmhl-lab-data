69 ON THE BLOOD. there are particles of fibrin of various degrees of rapidity of coagulation. And is it not also con- firmed by microscopical observation ? If we ex- amine, with a powerful microscope, a minute por- tion even of a drop of blood, as indeed is neces- sary ; is there not a variety observable in the par- ticles, either as regards the outlines of the discs, their thickness, or their other dimensions? The resemblance of one to the other is general and con- siderable ; but not without, as it has appeared to me, slight differences. To return now to the effect of moderate agita- tion on the coagulation of the blood,â€”it may be easily understood how seemingly contradictory re- sults may be obtained, if the effect is not very well marked. It certainly is not well marked. In some instances it has appeared rather to retard ; in others neither to retard, nor accelerate, and in others, and these the majority, to accelerate coagulation. As the majority of the experiments which I have made indicate this, I infer that agitation does pro- mote the coagulation of the blood out of the body# But admitting it to be a fact, I cannot adopt Sir Charles Scudamore's explanation of it, as it does not appear to me proved that any carbonic acid gas is disengaged from blood in the act of coagulation; or if it were, that its removal would have the effect imagined. I believe it is owing to a very different cause. I find that when a small portion of erassainentum is put into blood, the

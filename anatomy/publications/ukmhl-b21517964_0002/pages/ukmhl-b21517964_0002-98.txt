MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS 80 S.â€” O/i the Effect of Oxygen and of Carbonic Acid Gas on the Blood. My brother, the late Sir Humphry Davy, in his Researches on Nitrous Oxide, states that he did not find the coagulation of venous blood affected by either of these gasses.* According to Sir Charles Scudamore, blood coagulates sooner in oxygen gas than in atmospheric air, and cools slower ; and, in carbonic acid gas it coagulates slower, and cools sooner.f The experiments which I have made have afforded results similar to those first mentioned. I have not found the coagulation of the blood dis- tinctly accelerated by oxygen or retarded by carbonic acid; nor have I found any well-marked difference in either, in relation to the time of cooling. And, I did not simply expose the surface of the blood to the influence of the gasses, in the manner in which Sir Charles Scudamore made his experiments, but I agitated the blood in each gas. Of the oxygen, there did not appear to be any absorption ; if there were any, it must have been slight, which the form of the experiment was not fitted to detect. Of the carbonic acid gas there was a very considerable absorption, equal in volume to that of the blood used, or very nearly so. I have also tried the effect of water strongly impregnated with carbonic acid gas on the blood, and of oxygen gas on the crassa- * Op. cit. p. 381. t Essay on the Blood, pp. 59. 61.

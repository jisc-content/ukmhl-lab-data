AIR ON DEAD ANIMAL MATTER. 349 arising from them was offensive. On the 5th their temperature was 2° higher; on the 6th the same as that of the water; and so it continued, although a great deal of fetid air was disengaged, and the sur- face had become poultaceous and emitted an ammo- niacal odour. The stomach of No. 1 afforded re- sults very similar. Its temperature never exceeded that of the water more than 1°, and that only par- tially, where a few larvae were feeding, and a little froth was excited. And, in both instances, below the surface two or three inches, there was little change. After a month, the parts appeared entire; but, on minute examination, after having been well washed, the tissue which remained seemed to be chiefly the submucous cellular and the peritoneal; neither the inner coat, nor the muscular, could be recognized; and even the white tissues were, in part, losing their cohesion, and exhibited evident marks of slow decomposition being in progress. Cutis of inside of thigh, dura mater, tendo Achillis.—These parts were taken from body No. 1, and were placed together in the same vessel for observation. They underwent change slowly; their temperature gradually rose till it was 3° above that of the water, viz.,—on the 31st July, when the odour from them was slightly ammoniacal, their surface unctuous, and there were a few larvae feed- ing. After the 2d August, the difference of tem- perature was 1°, and it was the same on the 15th of that month. A good deal of yellowish poultaceous

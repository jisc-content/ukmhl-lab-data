Fibrin of blood.—On the 19th August, at 4 p. m. the fibrin of the whole blood of an ox was separated in the usual manner, by agitation, and was imme- diately well-washed and drawn out loosely, so that its surface might be well exposed to the air. In its moist state, as it was placed for observation, it weighed about four ounces and a quarter. On the following day, when the water was 78°, the fibrin about an inch below the surface was 85° ; its odour was peculiar, but not fetid ; this was about noon. At 2 p. m. the water being of the same temperature, the fibrin was 90° ; its odour was peculiar and rather offensive. At 6 p.m. the water the same, the fibrin had fallen to 87°. It had become soft, as it were melting or deliquescing, and in consequence had subsided so much, that it occupied only about half the space it did when first introduced, and of course was much less exposed to the action of the air. It was slightly alkaline, and a little of it, mixed with hydrate of lime, emitted a distinct ammoniacal odour. On the 21st, the water being 79°» the fibrin was only 80°. It was semifluid, of a light brown colour, and had a peculiar, rather disagreeable smell, distinctly ammoniacal. On the 23d, its temperature and that of the water were the same ; it was of a light grey colour, so fluid as to admit of being poured out in

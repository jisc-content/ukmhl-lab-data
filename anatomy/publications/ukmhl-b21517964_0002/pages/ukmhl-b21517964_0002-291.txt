279 X. ON THE ACTION OF CORROSIVE SUBLIMATE ON THE TEXTURES OF THE HUMAN BODY. The power which corrosive sublimate possesses, of preserving animal substances, has been known for many years, and has been taken advantage of by anatomists, both in the dissecting-room and the museum, to promote the objects of each, as has been well demonstrated by the minute and elaborate labours of Mr. Swan on the Nervous System. The property also which it has of precipitating albumen from animal fluids has been known for a considerable time, and, as a valuable test in analytical chemistry, has been studied with some care. But I am not acquainted with any researches hitherto made to investigate its action on the textures of the body generally. Conceiving that such inquiry was likely to afford results which might be interesting and useful, I applied myself to it in Malta, in 1828. I shall describe such of the experiments which I then made as I believe are to be depended on ; with the hope that they may lead to a renewal of an investi-

DIFFERENT TEXTURES OF THE HUMAN BODY. 383 poultaceous matter derived from the softening of the substance of the viscus. After maceration for a month or six weeks, there remained little besides its vessels, and the branches of its duct. These resisted decomposition mucn longer, especially the larger vessels, and the hepatic duct, and some of its branches, to which adhered, for a considerable time, very minute grayish or brownish granules. Lungs. (3. 4.)—The substance of the lungs softened pretty rapidly, and was easily broken up. A portion of it well washed, displayed very prettily the vascular structure of the organs ; after about a month or five weeks, little remained but the larger vessels, (some of which retained their minute rami- fications,) and the pleura comparatively little altered. Where there were tubercles, the alteration of soft- ening was quickest, and it commenced with the tubercles. It was very difficult to distinguish, during the progress of change, between the bronchia, and the blood vessels, and decide which underwent change most rapidly. Arteries—Aorta, (4. 5. 10.) Pulmonary Artery, (10.) Coeliac Artery, (8.) Femoral Artery, (4.)— These vessels underwent change very slowly. The different coats gradually softened, the inner and outer coat first. The inner coat became as it were mucilaginous, and was washed off or removed by the gentlest friction. The outer coat resisted longer ; it finally became disintegrated, and reduced partly to a kind of mucilage-like matter, and partly to its

13 ON THE BLOOD. gas combine they form a solid salt, without the slightest disengagement of heat. 2.— Observations to determine whether there is any well marked difference, in point of time, in the coagulation of venous and arterial blood, and in the degree of contraction accompanying it. To endeavour to determine the first question, the following experiments were made, in Edinburgh, during the summer of 1811, on the blood of lambs. The two kinds of blood compared were taken from the same animal,—one from the jugular vein, the other from the carotid artery; and each was received in a glass vessel, either the same, or similar, of about three-ounce capacity. The thermometer in the open air, where the experiments were made, stood at 70°. 1. Venous blood ;—in four minutes there was a commencement of coagulation; in six it was firmly coagulated. Arterial blood;—in half a minute it had begun to coagulate; in two minutes it was firmly coagu- lated ; and, in three, there was a distinct separation of serum. 2. Venous blood;—in two minutes there was a commencement of coagulation, and, in two and a- half, it was firmly coagulated. Arterial blood ;—its coagulation commenced as it

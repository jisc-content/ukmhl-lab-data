DIFFERENT TEXTURES OF THE HUMAN BODY. 379 the 12th, the concretion had become quite white, ra- ther soft, and of a slightly putrid odour. On the 22nd it was reduced to a kind of pulverulent sediment. The same change takes place in common fibrin of the blood, whether separated from the colouring matter artificially or naturally, as in the buffy coat, and as in the instance above given of the fibrinous concre- tions formed in the heart. The time required for the alteration is variable according to the degree of firmness of the fibrin and according to the tem- perature, being directly as the one, and nearly inversely, as the other ; or in other words, the firmer it is, so much the longer time is required ; and the warmer the weather, or the water, so much the shorter time. Muscle—heart. (4. 8).—Its muscular substance underwent rapid change ; it very soon became putrid and soft, and was washed away in the form of poul- taceous matter, very like that from the fibrin of the blood ; whilst its enveloping membrane, its valves, tendinous chords, and the great vessels taking their rise from it, were but little altered. With care at a particular period of the process of maceration, it was easy to show that the valves of the aorta and pulmo- nary artery are connected with the outer fibrinous sheath of these vessels ; and I am disposed to believe that these valves consist of this tissue in greater proportion, than of the inner coat, and that they owe their strength and peculiar properties rather to the former than to the latter. It is worthy of remark,

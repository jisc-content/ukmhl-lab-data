358 ON THE AGENCY OF ATMOSPHERIC this, is the substance alluded to, which I have wit- nessed on the surface of serum and fibrin, and of several solid parts in water in experiments on their putrefaction, continued from six to twelve months. The product from vinegar does not contain azote; that from the animal fluids and textures has afforded ammonia when decomposed with lime, at a red heat; but, as I am not sure, that any specimen of it, which I have yet examined has been perfectly pure, I cannot be certain that this difference of composition really exists between the two. Under ordinary atmospheric pressure and ex- posure to the atmosphere, the results of the putre- factive fermentation are various and modified; the circumstances become complicated, and the diffi- culty of appreciating them is vastly increased. The gases generated and absorbed, in part seem to re- act, and to exert a powerful modifying influence, both as retarding putrefaction and giving rise to combinations which have a similar tendency; and inspissation at the surface from evaporation, by forming a crust, more or less impervious to the air generated beneath, as well as to the external air, has a similar effect. Carbonic acid gas is power- fully antiseptic,â€”so are ammonia, and carbonate of ammonia, and sulphuretted hydrogen, as I have ascertained by experiments made expressly for the purpose. Thus, blood saturated with carbonic acid gas, did not putrefy so soon, as another portion to which none of the acid gas was added. A solution

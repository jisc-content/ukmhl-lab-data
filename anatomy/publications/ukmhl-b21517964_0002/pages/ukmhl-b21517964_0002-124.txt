Haller after passing in review the operation of a consider- able number and variety of re-agents, arrived at the same conclusion. The paragraph in which he expresses this opinion, is deserving of attention in the present times; I shall give it entire. " Arsenicum, dubium corporis genus, sanguinem cogit* rubrumque reddit. Cseterum infinita alia cum variis succis instituta experiments, apud cl. viros legere oportet, quos excitavi. Obiter autem in iis, quae repetii, discas, quam parum ad medica- mentorum virtutes dignoscendas utilitatis ab his experimentis possis arguere. Arsenicum enim, sum- mum venenum, sanguinem fere ut beneficum illud nitrum mutat. Acetum inter omnia pharmaca tristissimum colorem sanguini inducit, non ideo minus innocuum. Acidi liquores et lixiviosi pariter cogunt."f Reflecting on the results which I have described, and proceeding on the principle of induction, the conclusion of Hewson and Haller, in the present state of our knowledge, appears to be the only ligi- timate one. Haller contrasted the effects of white oxide of arsenic and vinegar. Other substances might be brought forward in the same manner,â€”as the hydrocyanic and hydro-boracic acids; the salts * This effect I have not witnessed, vide p. 98 . f Element. Phys. torn. ii. p. 83.

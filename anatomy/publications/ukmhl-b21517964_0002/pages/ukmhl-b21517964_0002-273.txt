DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE HUMAN BODY. 26l diseased; the inferior lobe of the left lung which afforded the specimen, No. 80, the specific gravity of which has been given, was compressed by the effused fluid in a very remarkable manner, and was entirely destitute of air. It bore no marks of in- flammation or of hepatization; and in sulphurous acid, it expanded like the substance of the corpus cavernosum penis.* To these brief notices of fatal cases, it may not be amiss to add some particulars relative to the dif- ferent specimens of hair of which the specific gravi- ties are given. The first three specimens of hair belonged to English women of the same family, be- tween the ages of thirty and forty years; two were light brown ; one was dark brown; all three were fine. The hair, No. 96, belonged to a woman of Corfu, aged sixty-six years ; it was grey, and very fine. No. 97 belonged to a man of the same island, aged seventy-seven years; it was white, and very fine and soft. No. 98 belonged to an Ipsariot; it was bleached, and probably, in consequence of the destruction of its oleaginous part, its specific gravity * Even when immersed in distilled water deprived of air, and placed under the exhausted receiver of the air-pump, it gave off only a few adhering air-bubbles. It would be difficult to explain this by the mere pressure of the effused fluid. Such a complete absence of air was probably owing to pressure and absorption acting together; and, in confirmation of this opinion, I may mention, thai I have found only a very small quantity of air in the lungs of ani- mals which have been killed by strangulation, by the ligature of the trachea.

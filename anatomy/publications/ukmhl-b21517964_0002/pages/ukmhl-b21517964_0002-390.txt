The colon was extensively ulcerated, &c. 3.â€” General Results of the Experiments on the Maceration of the different Parts of the Body.

The water, as already remarked, was changed every day, or every second day, and the changes produced, were as frequently observed during the first four or six months, and were noted down from time to time. Were I to give a minute account, of the observa- tions which I have made on the different parts of the body, whilst undergoing maceration in water, a volume would be required to contain them, the details would be extremely tedious, and their utility- very doubtful.

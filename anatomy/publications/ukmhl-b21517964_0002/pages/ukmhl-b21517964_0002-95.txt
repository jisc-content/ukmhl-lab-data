83 ON THE BLOOD. may not be owing to a vascular action more analo- gous to that of secretion. It is easy to conceive that under different degrees of vital action, the nature of the current of blood, either in the minute vessels, arterial and venous, or in the capillary vessels connecting them, or in both, may be modified; that in one condition more red particles may pass, in another a larger proportion of serum, in another of lymph. Is it not probable, that, were blood extracted from the cheek, under the influence of the peculiar feeling connected with blushing, it would be found to contain an undue portion of red particles ?—that the reverse would happen, in blood abstracted from the same surface under the influence of fear; when probably it would be found to abound more in serum. And, in a third instance, as in erysipelas of the face, it would probably befound to contain an excess of fibrin. In the embryo, a colourless fluid is the first which circulates.* Whether, independent of the lym- phatics, there is an order of vessels in the adult * This fact appears to have been discovered, if I may so say, at least three different times; by Glisson, nearly two centuries ago,—more recently by John Hunter,—and very lately again by MM. Delpech and Coste. Glisson, in his Treatise on the Anatomy of the Liver, published in 1564, says " Materia prima, e qua partes hunt, non est sanguis, sed succus quidam liquidus, albumini ovorum non absimilis, unde pullus cfformatur."—Anatomia Hepatis, p. 495. Amstel. 1659. Needham, a disciple of Glisson, is even more explicit on the sub- ject: in his treatise " De Formato Foeta" he speaks of a nutritive fluid, which " per venarum oscula nondum rubentia facile recipia- tur." p. 83.

EXPERIMENTS ON THE BLOOD 142 ration of the view taken, I laid too much stress on an inferred higher temperature in winter compared with summer of the deeply-seated parts of animals, speci- fying that of the heart and rectum of sheep, and which has not been fully borne out by my later ob- servations ; those indicating, that the average heat in summer is not less, but is very little higher than in winter. But, as regards the theoretical conclusion, so small a difference of animal temperature, con- trasted with the very great difference of atmospheric temperature—the former not exceeding 1°, the latter often 50°—can be considered very little less cogent, than if, as I erroneously supposed, the winter tem- perature of the heart were actually the highest. 2.—Does the Blood, especially Venous Blood, con- tain Carbonic Acid capable of being expelled by agitation with another Gas, as Hydrogen or Oxygen ? In a paper published in the Philosophical Trans- actions for 1835, Dr. Stevens has answered this question in the affirmative: he maintains that car- bonic acid gas exists in venous blood ; that it may be expelled by oxygen or by hydrogen, although not by the air-pump ; and he supposes that the difference of effect is owing to a peculiar attraction for car- bonic acid exercised by these gases. To endeavour to resolve my doubts on this impor- tant point, I have had recourse to the apparatus

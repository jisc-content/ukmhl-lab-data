423 THEORY OF MEM BRANE S. be said that of the stomach or nose. The lining membrane of the small intestines, is totally different from that of the large, or of the bladder of urine; and it is precisely the points constituting the dif- ference which ought to be remarked, much more deservedly so than the points of resemblance, which are very slight. In animals (he proceeds) the cha- racters are even more strongly opposed; in the stomach of the horse, the splenic portion is entirely different from the membranous pyloric portion. Each of the four stomachs of the ruminants offers a very different disposition of structure ;—to become acquainted with the function of each, it is necessary to study the peculiar structure of each. In general, it is of much more importance to be acquainted with the differences than with the analogies of things."* In this note, M. Magendie, it appears to me, has designated well the defective part of the doc- trines of Bichat—generalization,—which was his strength, indulged in to excess, constituting his weakness. His doctrine of membranes may be con- sidered as an hypothesis; such it was originally, and such I apprehend it is still. A few patholo- gical observations originated the notion of distinct elementary membranes; analogy led to the idea that they would be found distinct in structure and pro- perties; experiments and observations were made in expectation of confirming the analogy, and it ac- * Traits de Membranes, Nouvelle edit, revue par M.

AND FLUID IN THE PERICARDIUM. 245 Not quite half an ounce of fluid was found in the pericardium. On the addition of a little solu- tion of green sulphate of iron, no immediate change of colour was produced; on admixture of a little nitric acid, coagulation was occasioned, and a faint but distinct greenish hue appeared.* There was some crassamentum and cruor, and fibrinous concretion nearly colourless in the right auricle and ventricle, — the fibrinous concretions chiefly in the latter. A portion of this fibrin, mois- tened with the solution of sulphate of iron and a little nitric acid, became blue. In the left ventricle there was a little fibrinous concretion: this tested in the same way, acquired a greenish hue which was only just perceptible. Portions of the lungs were similarly tried. Some portions became greenish; some blue; the blue colour appeared chiefly in the course of the blood-vessels: even the walls of a large tubercular excavation, covered with false mem- brane, acquired a just perceptible greenish hue. These results seem to indicate that there was a slight exudation from the heart into the pericardium, but not exclusively so, nor to the extent to occasion the accumulation, which is corroborated by other circumstances. The serum from the blood, which flowed from the jugular vein after death, (it coagulated and afforded * Serum prevents the change of colour,—the instant coagulation is produced by nitric acid, the colour appears.

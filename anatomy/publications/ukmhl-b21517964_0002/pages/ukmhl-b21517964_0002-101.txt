ON THE BLOOD. 89 same colour as some, which for the sake of com- parison, was left exposed to the atmosphere, and its rate of coagulating was much the same—certainly not quicker—rather slower. On account of the interest of the subject, I shall describe two or three experiments, from which, and from others, I made these deductions in January 1828, at Corfu. Put under the receiver of an air-pump about an ounce of venous blood, collected as it flowed from the arm in a cylindrical glass vessel, and immediately exhausted the receiver. Until the exhaustion was nearly complete the blood was perfectly tranquil; suddenly it boiled up, almost in the manner of an explosion, and continued bubbling during half a minute at least. On the admission of air into the receiver, all the bubbles instantly subsided. The blood was not coagulated; it coagulated slower than a portion set by in the open air for comparison. A few days after, I repeated this experiment, with this difference,—the air of the receiver was slowly exhausted to allow the blood to cool below the boil- ing point of water in vacuo. Now, there was no ebullition, no effervescence, no disengagement of air, excepting of two or three adhering globules. When taken out, this portion of blood had just begun to coagulate; another portion, left exposed to the atmosphere, was coagulated firmly. The colour of each was similar. Repeated the experiment; taking precautions to prevent, as much as possible, the adhesion of air to

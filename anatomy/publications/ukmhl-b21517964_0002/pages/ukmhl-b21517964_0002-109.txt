97 ON THE BLOOD. Nitrate of silver unites with the albumen of the serum, which it precipitates in the form of an insolu- ble compound; but, though insoluble in water, it is readily soluble in acetic acid; and, it is not a little remarkable, that its solution in this acid is not precipitated by common salt. A strong aqueous solution of chlorine did not coagulate serum. Calf's rennet was tried on it, both cold and warm, without effect. 12.— On the Effect of Substances on the Blood, which do not coagulate Serum. According to their effects, as I have ascertained by experiment, these substances may be divided into three classes; viz. 1st, those which do not retard distinctly, or distinctly accelerate the coagulation of the blood ; 2d, those which retard or prevent its coagulation ; and 3d, those which accelerate its coagulation, or otherwise alter it. (1.)—Of those substances which do not distinctly retard or accelerate coagulation. The following substances, which I have tried, may be enumerated as belonging to this class, viz. chloride of silver, protoxide and peroxide of antimony, red precipitate, sulphur, iodine, hydrocyanic acid, carbonate of lime, starch, sugar, camphor, sulphuric aether, oil of peppermint, cantharides, oil of turpen- VOL.

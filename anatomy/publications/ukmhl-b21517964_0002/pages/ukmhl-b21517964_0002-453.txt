OF THE CARTILAGINOUS FISHES. 441 which I believe perform the double function of urinary bladders and of vesiculse seminales. The structure of the milt-like appendage, of the globular testis, and of the epididymis, corresponded to Baron Cuvier's and Professor Miiller's descrip- tion of them. In neither of the two former could I observe any appearance of tubular structure ; which was very strongly marked in the last. As in the instance of the torpedo, I made careful search after a connexion between the testis and epi- didymis ; and using nearly the same means, I was able to satisfy myself that such a connexion exists, and in the same situation, viz. between the superior extremities of the two parts, where the space sepa- rating them is inconsiderable (vide Plate 2). The tubes of connection, however, were smaller and more difficult of demonstration than the analogous ones of the torpedo. As the vasa deferentia were distended with a cream- like fluid, which had very much the appearance of spermatic fluid,â€”it appeared probable, that some satisfactory evidence might be obtained by instituting an examination of the contents of the different parts, and that it would be best effected by means of the microscope. Using a high power of one-eighth inch focal dis- tance I first examined the fluid contained in the sacs, which perform I suppose the double function of urinary bladders and of vesiculse seminales. It

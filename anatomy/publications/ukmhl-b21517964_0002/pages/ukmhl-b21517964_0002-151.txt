IN CONNEXION WITH RESPIRATION. 139 after agitation with the blood, but not exceeding one per cent, at a temperature between 40° and 50°. I shall notice in detail an experiment with each, as the results are of consequence. Ten cubic inches of venous blood (its fibrin dis- placed) from the jugular vein of a sheep, rapidly cooled, were agitated in twenty-two cubic inches of oxygen gas, which had been well washed with lime- water. After an absorption equal to about one cubic inch, some of the gas was expelled and passed into lime-water, the transparency of which it did not in the slightest degree impair. The same quantity of similar blood was similarly treated with common air, which also had been washed with lime-water. After an absorption equal to about one cubic inch, some of the air was passed into lime-water: it occasioned a just perceptible cloudi- ness ; and eighty measures of it agitated with lime- water were reduced hardly to 79'5. Taking it for granted that this very minute quantity of carbonic acid derived from the blood existed in the state of gas, and not contained in the aqueous vapour, as is possible, it is matter for consideration from whence it was derived,—whether it was formed at the moment by the action of the air on the blood, or, previously existing in the blood, was now merely expelled. Further on I propose to return to this important question. When I reflect on the results stated above relative to the absorption or disappearance of oxygen, and

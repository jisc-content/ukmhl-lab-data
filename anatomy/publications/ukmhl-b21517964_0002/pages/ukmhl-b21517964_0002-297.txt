The facts which induce me to adhere to the early opinion of Dr. Bostock, are chiefly these :— 1. When corrosive sublimate and albumen ovi combine, there is no disengagement or production of muriatic acid, as might be expected,—whether it contained calomel or oxide of mercury. In one ex- periment in which the whites of two eggs were mixed with a drachm of corrosive sublimate, and after coagulation at a temperature of about 120°— washed with a small quantity of water, and filtered, the water which passed through the filter, had no well marked acid property, and did not occasion any effervescence when mixed with a solution of car- bonate of potash. 2dly, I have not been able to combine calomel and albumen. When I have triturated together the white of egg and calomel, the latter has become grey, almost black as if from the formation of a little protoxide of mercury from the action of the alkali contained in the white of egg: but the white of egg itself has undergone no change. 3dly, and lastly, The attempts I have made to combine albumen and oxides of mercury directly, both the protoxide and the peroxide have been equally unsuccessful.

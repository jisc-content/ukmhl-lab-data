OTHER SECRETIONS, AND ON SOLID PARTS. 235 account for the expansion of the vessels, even to the capillaries: and its cessation in death, conjoined with atmospheric pressure, and the elasticity of the arteries and the force of gravitation, to explain the emptying of the arteries and superficial vessels, and the consequent pallor, and shrinking of the surface, which is then witnessed ; and as is also witnessed in a less degree, in momentary syncope, the same cause, as regards the heart, taking effect,—although unaccompanied by reduction of temperature, such as would be required to affect the condition of va- pour, were it in existence. Prochaska makes many excellent remarks on the porosity and permeability of vessels, admitting of a penetration by moisture, which amongst parts in contact, will act the same office as vapour; indeed, in stating his views on the subject of the porosity of the vessels,—he has adduced some curious facts, on an extension of which recently, the doctrine has been grounded of endosmosis and exosmosis. Before coming to a conclusion, it may be right to notice an objection which may be made to the results of my experiments in search of air in the animal fluids and solids, and the inference drawn from them, that no air in a state capable of being removed by exhaustion exists in them. It may be said, that animal membranes are permeable to air, and that therefore they must contain it, and not they alone, but also the fluids within them. This is true of the dead membranes,—especially the thinnest of

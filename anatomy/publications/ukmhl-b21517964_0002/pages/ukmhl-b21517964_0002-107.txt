ON THE BLOOD. 95 some carbonic acid gas was disengaged. The serum acquired a slightly opalescent hue, and its fluidity, perhaps, was in a slight degree diminished. The serum used was that of the blood of the sheep, which does not coagulate at 160°.* It was im- mersed in a glass tube in water of this temperature ; it remained transparent, and acquired the consistence of thin jelly. The same acid was next tried in great excess,— more was added to the serum than it was capable of dissolving. The results were similar, with this dif- ference,—that the jellying of the serum was pre- vented by heat,—even at the boiling temperature of water. The effects of the oxalic and tartaric acids were analogous. Strong acetic acid, in great excess, added to the same serum, did not coagulate it,—some gas was dis- engaged, and, perhaps, the fluidity of the serum was slightly impaired, but of this I was not quite certain. The mixture, placed in water of 160°, firmly coagu- lated, and the coagulum was opaque.f A solution, in water, of the sulphurous acid, of moderate strength, appeared to have no effect mixed * The point of coagulation of the serum of the blood of different animals is not the same; even amongst the mammalia I have ob- served a variation of temperature of 10° in this respect. The serum, the subject of the experiment, coagulated at 168°. t Vinegar, as it is well known, coagulates milk. The effect of a few drops of strong acetic acid, is immediate, even unassisted by heat, presenting a remarkable contrast with the effect of the other vegetable acids mentioned above, which, even when in large excess) and boiled, did not coagulate milk.

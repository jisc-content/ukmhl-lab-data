94 MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS to this view, on the ground of the minute portion of alkali existing in the blood,—and that this alkali may be neutralized,—and yet the serum remain liquid. He is of opinion, that the effect of coagu- lation, in the instance of serum, is one sui generis * The experiments which I have made on serum, have afforded results in favour of this latter view. I shall briefly describe them,—preliminary to others on the coagulation of the blood. The following acids, I find, do not coagulate serum, when cold, namely,—distilled vinegar, strong acetic acid, citric acid, boracic acid ; the tartaric and oxalic acids, and the aqueous solution of sulphurous acid. I shall notice, in detail, a few of the experi- ments. In two instances of the trial of citric acid, it was added in moderate excess to the serum, its crystals having been previously reduced to the state of fino powder. On agitation, the acid was dissolved, and in pelvi separatam, urinae forsan materiam aliquam, non autem uri- nam ipsam esse; licet colore et consistentia talis videatur. Quippe urina coctione non densatur in fibrosam mucaginem, sed potius in lixivium: aquosa autem sive saniosa haec pars, aliquandiu leviter cocta, in mucaginem innatantem abit: quemadmodum, vice versa, mucago istha;c, corruptione recrudescens, in saniem colliquatione revertitur."—Op. Omn. p. 406. How slow was the progress of animal chemistry, before it was methodically cultivated ! Between the time of Aristotle and Harvey, no positive advance appears to have been made; and the former, probably, was acquainted with the property of serum in question; it may be inferred from some expressions which he uses.—Phil. Trans, for 1809, p. 373. * Elements of Physiol, vol. i. p. 476.

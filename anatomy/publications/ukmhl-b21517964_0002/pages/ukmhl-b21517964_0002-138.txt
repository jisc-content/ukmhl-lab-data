They are chiefly, as it is supposed, a very soft crassamentum, very little, if at all, contracted,— or the blood remaining liquid,—or the proportion of crassamentum to the serum being unusually small. So far as I am able to judge, these appearances and qualities of the blood are not proved, by experi- ence, to be connected with the state of the system supposed. 1. In the remittent fever of hot climates, and in cholera morbus, both the common kind and the epidemic, the crassamentum of the blood drawn is generally softer than natural, and little, if at all, con- tracted ; and yet, blood-letting, in these diseases, is not generally injurious,—it is often beneficial,—and occasionally beneficial even when repeated. 2. Blood, without fibrin, in any disease, is very uncommon. I have witnessed it in extreme degree, only in cases of pulmonary ecchymosis or pulmonary apoplexy, as that lesion has recently been called,— and that after death, in the cavities of the heart and vessels,—but so soon after death, that it may be taken for granted, that it was not a post mortem change,—that it existed previously, and was probably connected with, and may have been partly the cause of the fatal effusion. In such cases, no practitioner, I suppose, would have hesitated, if called in in time, in abstracting blood, especially taking into consider-

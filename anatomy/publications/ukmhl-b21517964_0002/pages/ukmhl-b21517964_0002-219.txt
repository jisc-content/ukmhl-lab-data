AFTER DEATH. 207 entangled red particles of blood ; some exhibit the appearance of abscess, and contain as it were in a sac a puriform matter, generated by a peculiar pro- cess of softening. Generally they tend to give the idea of the operation of an organizing principle,â€”a nisus formativus more or less active until putrefac- tion commence, by which the animal matter is con- verted into common matter. The different varieties of fibrinous concretions are admirably illustrative of certain morbid appearances, especially false membranes, bands of adhesion, the state of the cellular tissue in different kinds of oedema and induration, and, I may add, hepatization of the lung with and without softening, and a similar state of the spleen, and perhaps tubercles and their softening. When I have examined microscopi- cally the matter yielded by the lung which has been hepatized, undergoing softening, I have found it very similar to the matter into which a fibrinous concretion is converted, whether in the ventricles of the heart or in a vein, composed of particles of different sizes, most of them approaching the spherical in form, and some of them very like pus globules; and I have found the same kind of matter in softened spleen, and also in softened tubercular matter. No subject, probably, in pathology is more de- serving of careful investigation than lymph, in con- nection with its varieties, supposing either that there are many different species of it, or thai it is liable

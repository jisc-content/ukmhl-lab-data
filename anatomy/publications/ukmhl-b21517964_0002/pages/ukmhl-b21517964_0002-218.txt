OBSERVATIONS ON THE BLOOD 206 The instances in the first Table were strongly indicative of the variable quality of the blood after death, from disease. The particular instances just given are as strongly corroborative of the same. The variable quality, as far as appreciable by the senses, seems to depend on the lymph, which as regards coagulability, has appeared wonderfully little constant; in some instances retaining its power of coagulation more than 26 hours after death,—in others, coagulating immediately after the fatal event, —and in some, previous to that event. In a large number of the cases, the lymph appears to have existed in the blood possessed of the quality in question in different degrees. This is clearly to be inferred from the results of the post mortem inspec- tions, viz. from finding at the same time, and in the same body, in the cavities of the heart, liquid coagu- lable cruor, soft crassamentum, and firm fibrinous concretions. The fibrinous concretions, which are so frequently found in the heart after death, are far from being devoid of interest. Their appearance, both as regards form and consistence, is very various. They are also very various in relation to the manner in which they are attached to the heart. I have men- tioned one instance in which serum was collected in the interior of a mass ; the inner part was soft, the outer surface firm. Some masses seem to have a certain regularity of structure; some have the ap- pearance of being inflamed, being blood-shot from

48 EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS of the subsidence of the red particles and the for- mation of the buffy coat in inflammatory blood, not an increased tenuity of the coagulable lymph, but the slow coagulation of the blood or lymph, and an increased quantity of fibrin. In a paper on this subject which was published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1822, I endea- voured to call attention to Hewson's original views, and to show, that in the production of the phenome- non in question, diminished viscidity is more con- cerned than diminished coagulability, using the ex- pression in relation to time. And in support of this theory, I adduced some instances, in which the buffy coat appeared on blood which was not marked for slowness of coagulation. I stated, that in certain cases " in which the inflammatorv diathesis is best marked, the separation of the red particles from the blood drawn is most rapid, often occurring in one or two minutes ; and, that in some diseases, particu- larly erysipelas, the blood taken from a vein coagu- lates as rapidly as healthy blood, and yet exhibits the buffy coat. In instances of this kind (it was remarked) when I have watched the coagulation of the blood, the red particles have subsided in the short space of two minutes, leaving a supernatant stratum of coagulable lymph, transparent and liquid. The buffy coat, in these instances, did not appear on the blood collected in the common bleeding cups only when small vessels, as wine-glasses or small gallipots, were used, and quickly filled and set aside to rest.*'

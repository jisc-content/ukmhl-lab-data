ON THE BLOOD. 45 Decanted Serum. Expressed colouring matter and Serum. Dried Fibrin. 1st V. S.—1st Portion 39*65 2d Portion 44'6 2d V. S.—2d Portion 30-3 53-68 42-8 30-8 •478 •37 •41 Now, doubtless, although the last portion of blood did not contain more fibrin than the first, yet, had the estimate been made not for the entire blood, but for the crassamentum, the proportion of fibrin in this last would have appeared to have been very much greater than in the first, in accordance with the preceding remark. Regarding the results generally, the same remarks are applicable to them, as to those contained in the 2d Table ; and, independent of the particular appli- cation, they are brought forward with the same view. The only ones which appear to me to require any special notice are those connected with the Patients, ing it to moderate pressure by means of the fingers, till little but fibrin remained. The fibrin was then well washed in the same bag until all the colouring matter was removed, when it was collected, and, previous to being weighed, dried on a platina capsule thoroughly at a temperature of 212°. And the same method in relation to the fibrin was used in every instance in which the proportion of it ob- tained is given in the Table.

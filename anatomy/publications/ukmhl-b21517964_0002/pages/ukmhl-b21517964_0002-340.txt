328 EFFECTS OF BOILING ON THE All these results, received even favourably, can be considered only as approximations. They would be more valuable for the purpose of comparison, had the specific gravity of each part been ascertained be- fore being subjected to boiling. However, imperfect even as they are, I hope they may not be without use as data for reasoning on, in forming general views of the analogies of textures. The results generally are not so accordant with those of Bichat, as described by him in his Ana- tomie Generale, as might be expected: nor are they in my opinion favourable to his views of dis- tinct differences in the qualities of certain membranes, which characterise his theory. He states that cellular membrane, and fibrous membrane are very differently affected by coction. In my trials it did not so ap- pear. Judging merely from the effect of coction, the conclusion, which seems most legitimate is, that which harmonises with the views of Haller,â€”that the majority of the white membranous and fibrous parts, are of analogous composition, differing rather in de- gree than kind; and not essentially different from cel- lular tissue; and each differing in like manner in degree in different situations, so as not to allow of any individual membrane or continuity of surface throughout its course being considered identical. amputated limb: those without the prefix of a letter or number, were taken from a body aged about 21; the latter were boiled eigh( hours.

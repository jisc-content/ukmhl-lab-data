L96 OBSERVATIONS OxN THE BLOOD served florid, was an instance of tabes mesenterica, without tubercles in the lungs. The mesenteric and lumbar glands were vastly enlarged,â€”some of them the size of pigeons' eggs, and contained a curd-like albuminous matter; and tubercles containing a similar matter existed under the mucous coat of the transverse colon. The blood in this instance was coagulated; its florid hue was most strongly marked in the aorta. The broken-up state of the coagulated blood referred to in the three last columns of the table, to the best of my knowledge, has not yet been de- scribed by any pathological writer. The appearance exhibited was as if one or both ventricles of the heart had continued to act after the coagulation of the blood had taken place within them. On no other idea can I account for the phenomenon. I never witnessed it in the blood-vessels, or even in the auricles, which perhaps may be considered in accordance with the supposition respecting its cause. Of the seventeen instances in which this condition of the blood was detected, death in the majority was owing to tubercular phthisis, viz. in 11 ; in two, the fatal disease was pneumonia, the lungs extensively hepatized; in one, abscess of the lung accompanied with gangrene ; in one, chronic dysen- tery accompanied with abscess in the liver; and in one the death was from violence, a soldier in good health was shot through the head by a comrade.

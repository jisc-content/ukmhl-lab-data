THEORY OF MEMBRANES. 4'21 3dly, Take the instance of a particular membrane, and examine it according to the views of Bichat,— as to the continuity and identity of structure,—and see what will be the result in point of evidence ; and let it be a mucous membrane as before proposed. If the alimentary canal be selected, how very dif- ferent will its different parts be found; the oesopha- gus with its epithelium, without papilla?, without villi; the duodenum with a villous surface, over a glandular structure; the jejunum with its villous valvulae conniventes, the colon without villi or pa- pillae, without valvulae conniventes, possessed of soli- tary mucous follicles. If the air passages be chosen, the results of the examination of the different parts will hardly be more dissimilar; as of the under sur- face of the epiglottis compared with the cordae vocales; or the surface of these compared with that of the trachea beneath ; or that of the trachea com- pared with the surface of the bronchial branches. In the different parts of the mouth, the differences of structure are even more strongly marked, as the upper and under surface of tongue,—the one covered with a thick epithelium, — the other I believe altogether destitute of epithelium. The surface of the amygdala? presenting fibrous cryptae, without epithelium; the surface of the palate, a dense fibrous structure, not I believe distinguishable from the periosteum, abounding in glandules covered with a thick epithelium; that of the uvula, delicate and yielding, little more than loose cellular tissue, con-

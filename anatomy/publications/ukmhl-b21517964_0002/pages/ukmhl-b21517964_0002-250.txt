238 THE AGE OF MORBID ADHESIONS; been artificially excited, I have witnessed the forma- tion of strong adhesions. An instance may be given. At Colombo, in the island of Ceylon, in January, 1819, I made the following experiment on a young dog, nearly full-grown. By an opening made with a scalpel, between the ribs of the right side of the chest, about a scruple of arrack was injected into the cavity of the pleura. The lung was slightly wound- ed ; air passed freely through the opening, and a little frothy mucus was discharged. The animal seemed at first to suffer pain and to be languid ; but left to himself, he gradually recovered, and in the course of the day took some food. At the expira- tion of twenty-four hours, the dog was hot, but ap- parently not suffering pain: he was running about and the wound was closed. The dog was now killed and was almost immediately examined. A good deal of coagulable lymph, which had the ap- pearance of being vascular, was found under the skin round the wound,—connecting the cutis and the intercostal muscles. The adjoining cellular membrane was inflamed. Some bloody serum was effused into the right cavity of the chest. Many pretty firm and long adhesions had formed between the pleura pulmonalis and costalis,—each of which was of a reddish hue. There were also many ad- hesions between the pleura and pericardium, and the pericardium itself was inflamed,—its surfaces ad- herent, and, consequently, its cavity obliterated. The coagulated lymph of the bufty coat of the

Villi and papillae ("villosites ou papilles" he did not distin- guish between them) he considered a part of the character of these membranes,—without exception and essential,—evidently guided by analogy, by what is witnessed in certain organs, as in the small intes- tines, as regards villi, and the tongue and glans penis as regards papillae: whilst, in point of fact, instead of being universal in mucous surfaces, as he generalized, it is more than questionable, if they are found any where else, at least in man. In relation to the general doctrines of Bichat on the subject of membranes, reasoning on the results of the experiments which I have detailed on macera- tion,—the conclusion which appears to me unavoid- able, is unfavourable; and, it is supported by the results of other experiments,—by those on putre- faction,—on the action of heat, and of coction, and of such chemical agents, the effects of which I have tried, especially of tannin and corrosive sublimate ; and also by various physiological and pathological facts and considerations, — altogether constituting the kind of evidence which Bichat himself, after he had formed his hypothesis, brought forward to sup- port it. Let us briefly consider the principles of these doctrines:— 1st, Relative to pathology; whence the first idea

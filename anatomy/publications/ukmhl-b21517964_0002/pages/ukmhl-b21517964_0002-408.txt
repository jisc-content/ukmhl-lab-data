It may be remarked that I could not follow the cuticle beyond the inner verge of the anus,—that, when it terminated, it seemed, as it were, to overlap, and to have no junction with any epithelium, similar to that which in the mouth connects the inner sur- face of that cavity with the outer surface of the lips. Gall Bladder and Biliary Ducts, (2. 4.)—Both the gall bladder and the biliary ducts were slow in suffering change from maceration, especially the latter. After twelve days, in the instance of No. 4, they had undergone no apparent alteration. After eighteen days, when a portion of the liver and pancreas attached to them were in a state of disintegration, the ducts did not appear to be at all changed; but the inner coat of the gall-bladder was softening, and, when gently rubbed under water, yellow particles were detached from it. After twenty-three days, the inner coat of the gall-bladder was slimy, and coming off" in flocculi, whilst the ducts were not materially altered; their peculiar structure remained distinct, the lancet-shaped valvular processes at and near the mouth of the common duct, and the transverse, and oblique fibres and chords, which some anato- mists have called spiral lamina?, in the cystic duct,

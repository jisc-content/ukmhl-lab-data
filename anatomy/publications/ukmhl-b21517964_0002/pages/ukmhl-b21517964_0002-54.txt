EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS 42 drawn from them, is, that there is no necessary, that is to say, no constant connexion between the spe- cific gravity of the blood and the presence or ab- sence of the bufTy coat. Confining the attention to the last Table, it appears that in five instances in which the bufTy coat was slight, the specific gravities were 1047, 1051, 1055, and 1054 ; in other five instances, in which the bufTy coat was moderately thick, the specific gravities were 1044, 1038, 1052, and 1056; in one instance in which it was thick, the specific gravity was 1057 ; and in one, in which it was ab- sent, (the blood of a person in perfect health) it was ]052. It may be laid down, I believe, as a general rule, that the blood of persons labouring under acute diseases, differs in specific gravity very little from healthy blood; and is of comparatively high spe- cific gravity, whether buffed or not,â€”or at least not below the mean : whilst on the contrary, the blood of persons labouring under chronic diseases attended with debility and wasting, is comparatively dilute, and of low specific gravity; and, this, though most frequently associated with the property of having a buffy coat, is not necessarily so. Moreover, in connexion with the present subject, I would further remark, that I do not believe, that the time required for coagulation is in any wise con- stantly connected with specific gravity, as the same author asserts; his words are, " blood possessing the highest specific gravity coagulates the most

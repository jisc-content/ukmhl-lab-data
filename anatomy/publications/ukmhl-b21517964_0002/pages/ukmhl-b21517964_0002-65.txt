53 ON THE BLOOD. of a vehicle : " propter seri defectum, sanguis, vehi- <?ulo suo spoliatus, circulatione ineptus redditur."* He was not only acquainted with the coagulability by heat of serum; but also of the liquor pericardii, and of lymph,—" lympha e glandulis secreta."f He appears to have been well acquainted with the ex- istence, in the blood, of a glutinous fluid, its nutri- tive and its coagulable part,—to which the coagula- tion of the blood is owing, and many morbid pheno- mena are referrible; thus, at page 130 of his work on the heart, he speaks of it, as " succus nutritius in sanguine admodum glutinosus;" and which " sen- sim concrescit, et pro cordis et vasorum conti- nentium figura, varie configuratur, unde pro cordis polypo, verme et serpente interdum habitus est." Borelli about the same time, or shortly after, enter- tained the same view of the blood, and announced it with even more precision, and illustrated it by experiment.J He had come to that conclusion also, which I have inferred Aristotle had formed,—that the glutinous part of the blood, in the living animal, is liquid; he was led to it by considerations connected * Tractatus de Corde, p. 131.—London, 1669. f Op. cit. p. 6. X " Primaria pars rubicunda constat ex glutinossisima quadam substantia lubrica, et ex succo quadam purpureo, qui simul impli- cati sponte concrescunt in grumos; et post concretionem crebris aquae ablutionibus apparet pars glutinosa, constipata in fibras Candi- das, vel in membranas reticulares similes tendinosis, ut in sanguine columbino patet; pars vero rubra grumefacta, et abstersa ab aqua, abit in pulverem rubicundissimam, in fundo aquas subsistentem."— Borelli de Motu Animalium, p. 192, (1685).

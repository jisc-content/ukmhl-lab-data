ON THE BLOOD. 9 was collected in a glass vessel. In about two minutes it had firmly coagulated. During the whole time I watched the thermometer immersed in it. The mercury sunk from 81*5 to 81°; it did not rise at the instant that the coagulation commenced, nor did it remain stationary whilst the coagulation was going on, but continued gradually sinking. The day following another shark was taken. The same experiment was made with the blood, and a similar result was obtained. On the 23rd of March, when in latitude 2° 29' S. and in longitude 24° 30' W., a large turtle was killed, which had been caught about three weeks before at the island of Ascension. The air at the time was 79°; the blood of the turtle, flowing from the carotids, was 91°. When collected in a tumbler it was 88*5. The thermometer placed in the midst of it, immediately began to fall, and continued fall- ing gradually, without any sensible interruption, whilst the blood was coagulating.* * On this subject, I made, in Ceylon and in Malta, some additional experiments. Bearing date of Colombo, May 4th, 1817, is the following note, which I shall transcribe verbatim. " Testudo Mydas—about 50 lbs. weight — caught yesterday; thermometer in recto 84-5 ; stream of arterial blood flowing from the divided carotids 85°; tem- perature of air 86°. " Made three experiments with the blood to ascertain under such favourable circumstances, whether any heat is evolved during the coagulation of the blood. The general results proved decidedly that there was no sensible heat evolved. "The blood, as it flowed, was 85°; collected in a glass vessel it was the same; it coagulated in about a minute,—still no change; in

400 ON MACERATION IN WATER OF membrane of the larynx, the tendon by which the epiglottis is attached to the chordae vocales at their junction, were the last parts that underwent decom- position ; and that they underwent the change in a manner analogous to the dura mater, and the tendons of muscles. The cartilage which yielded first was the epiglottis; next the arytenoid, and the cartila- ginous rings of the trachea; and, lastly, the annular and scutiform cartilages; and they underwent the change principally by a process of softening, becoming slowly converted into a mucus-like sub- stance. I may mention that I endeavoured to trace an epithelium from the tongue into the larynx, but in vain; also that I sought for a villous coat in the air-passages, but in vain. The lining membrane appeared to me to be of the nature of a fibrous tissue throughout, and strictly not a distinct mem- brane,—merely the boundary surface of the lining tissue and the component parts. I could detach no membrane from the chorda? vocales; their surface appeared to be the same as their substance,—closely and very firmly connected tendinous fibres. Nor could I detach a portion in the form or semblance of a membrane from any part, except correspond- ing to a comparatively loose fibrous tissue, in which or beneath which, are situated the glands, which give the surface the character of a mucous mem- brane.

EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS 10 These results were inserted in a paper published in the second volume of the Journal of the Royal Institution, with some others, in reply to Dr. Gor- don. This gentleman, about eighteen months pre- viously, had endeavoured to support his original opinion by further experiments, an account of which appeared in Dr. Thompson's Annals of Philosophy. I shall add my remarks on them, believing that they may help to explain the effect, in accordance with what I witnessed. The difference between the results of Dr. Gordon's experiments and my own arose, perhaps, from the different modes in which our experiments were made. Dr. Gordon, I believe, kept the bulb of his about two minutes the coagulum was firm,—temperature still the same. In about half an hour the blood had acquired the temperature of the air, which was then 87°." And another, bearing date of the 23rd October, 1819.—" A large green turtle was brought to me this morning. The great vessels of the neck were immediately divided. A wine glass was quickly filled with arterial blood : a thermometer in it rose to 82° (air at the time 79°); in two minutes it was coagulated slightly—thermometer still 82°; in five minutes it had coagulated firmly—thermometer 81°. A very delicate thermometer was used." At Malta, a similar trial was made on the 21 st December, 1838, on the blood of a turtle, which had been kept about two months in water, without eating, and yet was active. The temperature of the water was 58°, that of the air of the room 60°, two hours earlier it was 58°; the blood of the turtle, flowing from the great vessels of the neck (the jugular veins and carotid arteries) was 58°. It was collected in cups, and, in about half an hour, was firmly coagulated. During this time, whilst the coagulation was taking place, I tried, repeatedly, the temperature of the different portions, with a delicate thermometer, but could perceive no change.

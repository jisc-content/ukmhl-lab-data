301 ON VEGETABLE SUBSTANCES. carbonic acid, and found to be perfectly free from it,—not effervescing in the slightest degree in dis- solving in an acid. For comparison, two other mixtures were at the same time made of the same vegetables and water, and bottled,—one of which was corked, being about half full of air; the other was not corked, a little cotton-wool merely was put into the mouth of the bottle to exclude dust and prevent evaporation. Examined on the 1st November 1838, the mix- ture with the lime, appeared to be but little altered; the leaves and the flower retained their form; the former were of a bright fresh green ; the latter had become brown ; the water was colourless ; the lime had acquired a light greenish hue; it dissolved in dilute muriatic acid without giving off a particle of carbonic acid gas. The water evaporated, yielded but a small residue, consisting chiefly of lime. The leaves and flower though they retained their form, yet when shaken in the bottle, were broken into small pieces, and the leaflets detached. Farther, it may be remarked, that the smell perceived on drawing the cork, was similar to that of bruised clover. The other mixtures to which lime had not been added exhibited different results. That which was corked, a portion of air included, examined on the 4th November 1838, appeared much altered; there was at bottom a light greenish sediment,—at top an almost black mass, and suspended in the water in-

23 ON THE BLOOD. method employed in the trials, the results of which are about to be given. It was the same as that now commonly used for ascertaining the specific gravity of other fluids. On entering upon the inquiry, I provided myself with a certain number of thin glo- bular bottles, varying in capacity from 200 to 400 grains of water. Each bottle had a narrow neck, to which was adapted by grinding a perforated glass- stopper, so as to admit of accuracy in filling. The weight of the fluid examined was always compared with that of distilled water; and trial of the latter was made as often as any material change of tem- perature occurred to render it advisable. In each instance, before making trial of the blood, it was allowed to acquire the temperature of the atmo- sphere, and then the small vacant space in the bottle, the effect of cooling, was filled with serum. In the earliest experiments a balance was used of no great delicacy : it was affected, however, readily by the one-tenth of a grain. In the latter, one was substi- tuted which was affected by the one-fiftieth of a grain; and in the latest of all, one still more delicate, con- structed by Robinson, which when loaded with 600 grains, was turned by an hundredth of a grain. For the sake of brevity, I shall give the results of my experiments in a tabular form.

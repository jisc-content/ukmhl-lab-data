418 GENERAL REMARKS ON BICHAT's along that texture or membrane,—but extending in a perfectly opposite manner; in the alimentary canal, for instance, perforating through all the coats into the cavity of the abdomen, giving rise to fatal peri- tonitis;—in the subcutaneous cellular tissue, to take another instance, not spreading as in diffuse cel- lular inflammation, through the tissue in which the diseased action commenced, but extending directly outwards, and penetrating through the integuments, as happens in common phlegmon ? Would in one disease, various and dissimilar organs be affected,— as happens in so striking a manner in tubercular phthisis,—to the extent, to baffle calculation as to the limit of complication; and as happens, in the majority of instances of the exanthemata, when they prove fatal, especially in small pox, measles, scarla- tina, and erysipelas, the fatal termination of which is commonly owing to the supervention of disease in some deeply seated organ, frequently never sus- pected during life,—not having been indicated by any well marked symptoms ? The evidence derived from pathology dispas- sionately considered, appears to me on the whole far stronger against, than for the peculiar views of Bichat. Guided by these views, one cannot pro- ceed a step in the careful examination of disease in connexion with structure without encountering diffi- culties. I shall notice in the briefest manner only a very few,—and for the sake of briefness in the form of questions. Why is the aorta so frequently dis-

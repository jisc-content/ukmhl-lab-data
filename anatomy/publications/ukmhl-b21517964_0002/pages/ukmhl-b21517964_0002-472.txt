ON THE MALE ORGANS 460 sible, that these organs may be designed for intro- mission, and for retension like the penis of the dog ; on this idea, the abundant secretion of the gland as a lubricating fluid would be of manifest use; and the action of the different parts might admit of ex- planation.* And, as the sacs connected with the appendages in some of the sharks open appropri- ately, they may be supposed to be designed for the same use.f In venturing to bring forward this con- jecture, I beg to be understood, that I attach no kind of importance to it. I am fully aware that it is liable to objection, or at least that it wants proof. It seems, however, deserving of consideration ; and in offering it to notice, I shall be satisfied, should it excite curiosity and lead to farther inquiry, by which alone the true use of these mysterious organs can be determined. * After writing the above, on referring to Aristotle, that great and curious store-house of Natural History, I found that the same notion had been entertained in his time, and that something of the kind is reported as having been actually witnessed : " Sunt qui se vidisse confirment nonnulla ex cartilagineis aversa modo canum terrestrium cohaerere."â€”De Hist. Animal. 1. v. c. v. Aristotle probably heard this from fishermen, a class of men from whom principally we must expect to derive information respecting the habits of fish, and who, in the clear and often perfectly calm waters of the Mediterranean, and especially of the Archipelago, have the best opportunities for making such observations. f In the specimen of ScyUium which I examined with Dr. Smith, there was an interruption between the outer opening of the sac near the anus, and the slit or groove in the appended organ, so that the fluid poured out, in part, would be directed towards the anus, and in part, if copious, flow over the short intervening space of smooth skin, and enter the groove, and descend to the extremity.

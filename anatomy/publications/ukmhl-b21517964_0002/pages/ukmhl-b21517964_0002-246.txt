234 TRIALS WITH THE AIR-PUMP ON 2d Experiment. This experiment was conducted precisely in the same manner as the preceding. The portion of carotid artery included between the two ligatures, measured before excision, was 1*40 inch in length, and -20 in breadth. Immediately after excision the length was 1*32, the breadth remaining unaltered. It was subjected to the air-pump in the same manner and after the same time, and with the same negative result. Now on admeasurement, no change could be detected in its dimensions, either in length or diameter. In both instances, the artery which was cut out was unusually tense and hard; and when punctured, the contained, and as it would appear, compressed blood sprang forth with force, and to the distance of about two feet, as if from an animal alive. These results, carefully considered, I apprehend, can in no wise be received as favourable to Pro- chaska's views of the existence and operation of an expansive vapour in the living body. As the con- traction of the artery took place immediately on its division and excision, agreeably to what is known of the properties of arteries, and was not increased by cooling, it is not for, but in opposition to, the argu- ment used by the learned professor. The pheno- mena themselves which he endeavours to explain by means of his imagined cause, do not require it. The heart's action during life, seems sufficient to

ON MACERATION IN WATER, ETC. 373 It was when stationed in Malta, in the year 1828, that I was induced to engage in the investigation for the purpose of removing doubts, and of gaining in- formation which was not to be collected from books. The results then obtained, were published in the 41st volume of the Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal; though they were far from being so finished as I could wish, I again bring them forward, with the hope, that as a contribution to anatomy and animal chemistry, they may be of use. 1.— The Circumstances attending the Experi- ments. The experiments were all made in the laboratory of the General Hospital,—formerly the hospital of the Knights,—a room, by its equable temperature, well adapted for the purpose, and they were carried on during a period very nearly comprehending twelve months. The water used for maceration was aqueduct water, that of the town of Valetta, which appears to be very much the same in quality throughout the year; and seems to be variable chiefly in temperature, from being conveyed a dis- tance of about eight miles, and a considerable part of the way, running very slightly protected from at- mospheric influence. During the spring months its temperature varied from about 55° of Fahrenheit to 65°; during the summer from about 65° to 75°; during the autumnal from about 75° to 65°; and

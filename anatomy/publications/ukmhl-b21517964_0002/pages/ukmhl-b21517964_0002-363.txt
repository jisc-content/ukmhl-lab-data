AIR ON DEAD AMIMAL MATTER. 351 described in the preceding instance, with the exception of the loose cellular coat, which, in that instance, was excluded; it did not keep progress with the rest,— after a month's exposure it was very little changed/ Intervertebral substance.— A portion from the lumbar spine was taken from body No. 5, on the 7th of August. On the 13th, it had a peculiar odour, neither putrid nor ammoniacal. After a month, it was very little changed; and, during that time, its temperature was not sensibly elevated above that of the water. From other experiments, I have ascer- tained, that a very long time is required for the de- composition of this substance, and that even after a year, it is not very considerably changed. Besides the preceding, I have made trial of other parts, as the pancreas, kidney, spleen, prostate. They have undergone change rapidly like the liver; their temperature has been considerably elevated; they have all softened, as it were liquefied like fibrin, and ammonia in great quantity has been generated. I apprehend, more than sufficient has been ad- duced, in the results of the preceding observations, to decide the question proposed—" Whether or no the putrefaction of animal matter is attended with elevation of temperature ?" It seems proved, that those parts which undergo rapid change, as the fibrin of the blood, brain, muscular fibre, and the parenchymatous substance of the glandular struc- tures, give off" a good deal of heat in being converted from the solid into the liquid form: and, as other parts

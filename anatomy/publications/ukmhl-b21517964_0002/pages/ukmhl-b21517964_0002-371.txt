AIR ON DEAD ANIMAL MATTER. 359 of the sesquicarbonate of ammonia, in the propor- tion of three grains to the ounce of water, prevented the putrefaction of a portion of muscle immersed in it about a month ; and a solution of the strength of five grains to the ounce of water, preserved a piece of jejunum more than eight months, and I know not how much longer; and displayed the minute structure of the part, in a very striking manner. Reduction of temperature is another disturbing cir- cumstance, which tends, I believe, to give rise to new combinations, especially to the formation of adi- pocire, and to render the problem as to the changes which take place, more complicated.* Even in this view of the subject, there is no want of simi- larity between the putrid fermentation and the vinous; and a considerable degree of analogy might be traced, very far, were we to consider the particular agents which retard or prevent the two kinds of fermentation ; indeed, I am not acquainted with a single agent, or circumstance, the effect of which is limited to the vinous, or to the putrefactive fermentation. They all appear common to both, and also to the fermentation of vegetable matter generally. Such is the effect of corrosive sublimate, of the sul- phurous acid, of tannin, of salt, vinegar, alum, spirit * Adipocire, I believe, like peat, never forms where the atmo- spheric temperature is high; I have never witnessed the production of either of them in warm climates, excepting, in the instance of peat, on mountainous regions, where the average temperature is moderate, and in that of adipocire, during the cool months, in the Mcditeranean.

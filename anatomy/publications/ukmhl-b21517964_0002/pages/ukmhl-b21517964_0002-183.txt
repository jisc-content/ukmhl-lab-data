IN CONNEXION WITH RESPIRATION. 171 nitrous gas before and after, seem to be most in favour of the idea, that the oxygen, in the first instance, is simply absorbed, and that the heat evolved is merely the effect of its condensation; or, that if any of it enters into immediate union with the carbon, it is only a small part of the whole. 8.â€” Theoretical Remarks. Should the results detailed in the preceding pages be confirmed on repetition, they can hardly fail to have some effect on the theory of respiration and animal heat. As regards the former, they appear to me to tend to show that the lungs are absorbing and secreting, and perhaps exhaling organs, and that their peculiar function is to introduce oxygen into the blood and separate carbonic acid from the blood. As regards animal heat, they appear to favour the idea, that it is owing, first, to the fixation or con- densation of oxygen in the blood in the lungs in conversion from venous to arterial; and secondly, to the combinations into which it enters in the cir- culation in connexion with the different secretions and changes essential to animal life. In illustration of what I imagine the secreting power of the lungs, I may mention the difference of effects in an instance of death by strangulation, and another by exhaustion of air from the lungs by the air-pump.

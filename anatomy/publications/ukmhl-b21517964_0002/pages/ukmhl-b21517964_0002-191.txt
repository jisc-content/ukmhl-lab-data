179 IN CONNEXION WITH RESPIRATION. Experiment 1. Equal parts of the cruorof the venous blood of an ox, and water, were mixed together. The colour of the mixture was darker than that of the cruor alone, especially by reflected light. Under the microscope, no blood discs could be discovered in the mixture, —only small globules, about one-third of the diame- ter of the discs, of faint appearance, as if transparent. Solution of salt added to the mixture rendered it of a brighter red—light scarlet. Now, under the microscope, the particles appeared smaller, and well defined, and distinct, so that they were most easily seen. The distinctness of their appearance was not increased by the addition of corrosive sublimate.* In similar trials with solution of ammonia, of * When a portion of crassamentum is put into water, its hue is presently darkened; and the same effect is produced by allowing water to run over the crassamentum. Dr. Stevens is of opinion that this is owing to the removal of the saline matter by the water. Ac- cording to my observations, in conformity with those stated in the text, it is occasioned by a change in the blood-corpuscles themselves, and a partial solution of the colouring matter. When the darkened crassamentum is taken from the water and put into a solution of salt, it immediately acquires a brighter hue. This Dr. Stevens refers to the restoration of the saline matter. I apprehend it is owing to the effect of the saline matter chiefly on the altered blood-corpuscles,— by which they reflect more light. It is surprising how slowly the colouring matter is removed from the crassamentum by water, when the mass is not broken up; the water appears to penetrate very slowly through it; and the colouring matter, even when dissolved, seems to be retained in the mass as in a sponge.

58 EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS of an egg, in remaining fluid, when exposed to the air, and coagulating when exposed to heat, or when mixed with ardent spirits, or some other chemical substances."* The views of Hewson, on the subject of coagu- lable lymph, on the coagulation of the blood, the formation of the buffy coat, the contents of the lymphatics, on the analogy between the coagulable lymph which they contain and the coagulable lymph of the blood, are so clear and precise, and deduced from such admirable experiments, that it appears not a little difficult to comprehend, how they could be either over-looked or not perfectly understood or appreciated. And yet, that they have been, is the unavoidable impression received in reading some of the works of the able physiologists of the present day. Justice has not yet been done to the high merits of Hewson, either as a most acute and accurate observer, or as a very original inquirer. Dr. Baly, in his trans- lation of Professor Miiller's work on Physiology, in a note to that part of the text, in which it is said, that Berzelius suggested the idea that the clot is composed of fibrin enclosing the red particles, supports the just claims of his countrymen, and in part those of Hewson, but not, I think, to the full extent of his merits. Hewson's ideas on the nature of coagulable lymph, founded on the results of his experiments and observations, appear to me as clear as possibleâ€”even as clear as those of Professor Miiller himself, and that * Op. cit. p. 6.

240 THE AGE OF MORBID ADHESIONS opinion is supported by any precise facts. As a theoretical conclusion its correctness seems doubtful. I have endeavoured to put it to the test of experi- ment, and the result has been unfavourable. I have notes of three different experiments on dogs, which were made in Ceylon in 1818,â€”all of which seem to show that, under ordinary circumstances, no effusion of serum or exudation, so as to occasion accumula- tion, takes place after death. The experiments were briefly the following. In each instance a healthy dog was suddenly killed by a blow on the occiput; the cavity of the chest was instantly laid open and the pericardium inspected ; a small quanity of serum found in it, was removed by a sponge, and the in- cisions were then closed by sutures. At the end of twenty-four hours the sutures were divided, and the pericardium was again examined. In no instance had a single drop of fluid collected in the pericar- dium ; and yet, in two instances, the right auricle and ventricle were considerably distended with blood. If these results be conclusive against fluid being effused into the pericardium, after death, in dogs, the inference from them admits of being extended, by analogy, to other cavities of the same texture and to man ; and I am not acquainted with any pathological observations in opposition to it. The discoverv of serous effusions in examinations post mortem, no symptoms of their occurrence or existence having been noticed during life, is surely no evidence of

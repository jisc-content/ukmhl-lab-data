340 ON THE AGENCY OF ATMOSPHERIC the atmospheric air was entirely consumed: car- bonic acid gas continued to be disengaged, in which sometimes a little carburetted hydrogen might be detected, and sometimes a little sulphuretted hydro- gen ;â€”ammonia was constantly formed ; but I have not been able to satisfy myself that any azote was either absorbed, or evolved, at least in the early period. The appearance of carburetted hydrogen was most striking in the instance of muscle; it occurred irregularly; sometimes early in the pro- cess, more frequently at a later period; one day, it might be detected in the air generated, not in the next. A softening of the parts, like a deliquescence, always marked the progress of the change, and most of them became poultaceous. After about a fort- night or three weeks, brain, muscular fibre, the paren- chymatous substance of the glandular structures and the spleen, were reduced to a very soft state, and on washing them, the soft matter, the result of putrefaction, was removed, and the vascular struc- ture of the part well displayed; and in the instance of muscle, the tendonous attachments also, and the aponeuroses: and these in their turn yielded and became decomposed, the process being allowed to continue, as I shall have a better opportunity in describing in the next section when noticing the same changes taking place in the open air.

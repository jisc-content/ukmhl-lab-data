374 ON THE MACERATION IN WATER OF during the winter from about 65° to 55°. In the cool season, it was always a few degrees above the temperature of the room; and in the hot season a few degrees below it. But as the water was changed every day, or every second day at furthest, and as a gallon or two was generally used for maceration, the alteration of the temperature of the water during the progress of the experiments was immaterial and un- deserving of particular attention. I have said that the quality of the water was apparently always much the same. This I have not proved by analysis; it is conjectured from considering that the aqueduct is fed by springs in limestone rock which are perennial, and very little affected by the seasons. In July, just before I entered on the inquiry, I particularly examined the water. Its temperature then as it flowed from the pipe into the room, was 73°, its specific gravity was 1008 ; 100 measures of it con- tained 4 measures of air, and this air consisted of 10 carbonic acid gas, 62 azote, 28 oxygen. Its saline and earthy contents were very inconsi- derable, not quite 3V0 <r part, and consisted chiefly of carbonate of lime, dissolved by carbonic acid, and of common salt, with a very little lime and magnesia, and fixed alkali in combination with the sulphuric and muriatic acids. The vessels in which the parts were subjected to maceration were glass jars, vary- ing in capacity from one to two gallons. In some instances, they were covered slightly to keep out dust; in others they were uncovered. The subjects

Nor is this at all surprising, considering the small quantity of solid matter contained in the crassa- mentum, to which it performs the part, as it were, of t cement, or of calcareous matter to sand, com- bined with which the sand constitutes a solid rock, and deprived of which it is a yielding quicksand, almost as fluid, as the red particles of the blood de- prived of fibrin. In confirmation of this explanation, I may add, that blood rendered apparently liquid as above de- scribed, when examined by the microscope, is found to contain, besides the blood-discs, which are little altered* floating in the serum,—masses of fibrin, of irregular form and structure, — (neither dis- tinctly globular nor fibrous) and particles also of irregular form, very much smaller than the blood- discs. On rest, after a few hours, a separation takes place,—the red particles, in consequence of their greater specific gravity, subside towards the bottom, and the particles of fibrin, owing to en- tangled air, collect at the surface. 2.— On the Effect of moderate Agitation on the Blood. Sir Charles Scudamore in his Essay on the Blood, endeavours to shew that moderate agitation of the * The discs after agitation are not quite so regular in form as before.

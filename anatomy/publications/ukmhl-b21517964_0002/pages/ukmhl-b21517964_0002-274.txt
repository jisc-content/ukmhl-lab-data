262 ON THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF was so high.* The hair, No. 99, belonged to a Hot- tentot woman, a native of Cape Town, about twenty years old; it was black, coarse, woolly, and almost felted together, admirably adapted for protection against the sun ; but it had not been exposed to its action.f No. 100 belonged to a young woman of Pitcairn's Island, in the Pacific Ocean, a daughter of Adam, one of the mutineers of the Bounty; it was reddish-brown, partially discoloured by the action of the sun's rays; rather coarse, but not in the slightest degree woolly. * On the results generally I shall offer a few remarks: * This hair was taken from the body of an Ipsariot, which, when I visited Ipsara, in the winter of 1826, was lying exposed with many others, in the battery, called Fatellio, where they had fallen, making a brave but vain defence against an overwhelming Turkish force, by whom, in the short space of a few hours, this before-flourishing island was made a desert, in the most literal sense. Though rather more than two years had elapsed since the massacre, when I saw them, the bodies were little changed; indeed, the features were so distinct, though black and shrunk, that our guide (the only living inhabitant in an island which before had an active population, ex- ceeding 15,000) recognised each person and called him by name ; even their clothes (they had not been stripped) had experienced little change. The situation of the place where they fell was dry, and its aspect northerly. In the castle of Ipsara, on the contrary, which had a southerly aspect, nothing but whitened bones remained of the nu- merous victims of despair, who blew themselves up by exploding the magazine, when the place was taken. These facts strongly ex- emplify the difference of character of the very dry Etesian, or north- erly wind of the Mediterranean, and of the very humid Sirocco, or southerly, and especially in the Archipelago. t The effect of the sun's rays on the hair of the Negro, is, I believe, analogous to that on the European, &c, but less powerful | I sav, believe, because I am not quite certain of it.

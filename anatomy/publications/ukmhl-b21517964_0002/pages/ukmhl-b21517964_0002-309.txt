TEXTURES OF THE HUMAN BODY. 297 The effects of the alkalies, as might be expected, were sufficiently well marked. Ammonia, in the form of aqua ammonise, acted very like lime. Portions of skin, of sole of foot, nail, hair, intestine, dura mater, after having been a fortnight in this liquor, had very much the same appearance, as if they had been immersed in lime water. The cuticle was detached; it was quite pulpy; it offered no resistance to pressure, and in consistence was not unlike starch gelatinized by cooling. The other parts, not including the nail and hair, were rather soft and swollen, but not materially changed ; the hair and nail shewed no alteration, with this exception in regard to the latter, that its inferior stratumâ€”its under sur- face, was softened, like cuticle. After another fortnight, the cuticle was found to be quite dis- solved ; the other parts, including nail and hair, remaining as last noticed : nor after another month were they found further altered, excepting that they were softer, especially the skin, which had become very flexible, and no longer retained the hair. Weak solution of potash, in the form of aqua potassse, tried on the substances last noticed, had very little effect on any of them; it prevented indeed their putrefaction, and softened them, but no more ; after a fortnight, they appeared unaltered, and the cuticle was not detached. A strong solution of potash, formed in the pro- portion of a dram of the hydrated alkali to an ounce

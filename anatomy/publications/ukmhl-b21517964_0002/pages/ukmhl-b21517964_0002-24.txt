12 EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS when slowly evaporated to dryness, an ounce of it afforded a brittle translucent residue, weighing 36*7 grains. It was procured from the blood of a patient labouring under a tedious chronic disease; which blood was only of specific gravity 1*047 ; and an ounce of it afforded 2*4 grains of dry fibrin. The inference from this fact, reasoning analogi- cally, seems to me unavoidable, viz., that it is highly improbable any heat can be given off, during the coagulation of the blood, in which so small a quantity of matter becomes solid, and that slowly,— since not the smallest degree is evolved during the coagulation of serum, when so large a quantity of matter, so similar to fibrin in its nature, is solidified, and that suddenly. I would remark, in conclusion, that as regards the general rule before referred to, of change of temper- ature with change of form, — it has so many ex- ceptions, that no reliance can be placed on it. Every instance requires to be specially considered and de- termined experimentally. Thus, contrary to rule, theoretically considered, all the detonating com- pounds, whether they contain oxygen or not, emit heat in the act of explosion, and of conversion entirely, or in part, into the state of an elastic fluid; thus, carbonic acid when expelled from lime by dilute muriatic acid, is converted from the solid to the gaseous state, without any change of temperature ; and thus, further, when ammoniacal gas and muriatic acid

ON THE BLOOD. 127 a lion the plethoric habits of the individuals, to whose cases I allude, and their previous apparent robust health. In a less degree, I have witnessed the same state of blood in cases of cynanche,â€”and, in one in par- ticular, after death, which made a strong impression on my mind. This I shall briefly notice, as it ap- pears to me instructive, bearing on the points in question. A young healthy man, previously liable to cynanche tonsillaris, was attacked with sore throat.

IN CONNEXION WITH RESPIRATION. 1 (j 1 arterial blood of the sheep and the results also were similar and equally well marked. Considered as test experiments, the first inference from these results is, that carbonic acid gas, or an air absorbable by a solution of potash, is disengaged both by venous and arterial blood in vacuo; and next, that no other gas is disengaged from either of them, neither oxygen nor azote, each of which is un- absorbable by the solution in question. I have repeated the experiment twice on the venous blood of man, and twice on the venous blood of the sheep, and twice on the arterial blood of the latter, without variation of results; and they are more to be de- pended on, as the alkali has the effect of preserving the blood liquid. I may mention another method which I have em- ployed as a test experiment; and, first in relation to carbonic acid. If the blood contain a notable por- tion of this gas capable of being extricated by the air-pump, it necessarily follows, that when subjected to the action of the air-pump, and deprived as far as possible of its fixed air by this means, it will be capable of absorbing a larger quantity of carbonic acid than previous to the exhaustion. The follow- ing Table contains the results of three comparative trials on the venous blood of the sheep, its fibrin separated or detached in the usual manner. vol. n. M

479 OBSERVATIONS ON PUS. pus-globules. Some facts are not unfavourable to this idea; thus, though the globules are rendered more translucent by a solution of potash, soda, or ammonia, the molecules are less apparent than even when in water, and if either of these alkalies be added to a mixture of pus and acetic acid, the molecules, before very visible, become indistinct. At other times, I have supposed that the appearance in question might be connected with the existence of particles of fat in the globules, on which the acetic acid would have little effect, and might render more conspicuous by increasing the transparency of the enveloping part. The circumstance, that alcohol does not render the molecules more but less distinct, whilst it augments the translucency of the involucra, is rather favourable to this idea. I venture to ex- press the foregoing doubts, and to offer these con- jectures on this obscure subject, with hesitation, and the hope, that they may lead to further inquiry. In justice to Mr. Gulliver, I should remark, that I have not read his paper referred to on the composition of the pus-globule; the volume of the Transactions of the Medico-Chirurgical Society, in which it will appear, not having yet been published. 8. Relative to that important question in patho- logy, the mode of formation of pus, it is matter of very interesting inquiry, whether it is a secretion de- pending on a peculiar state of vessels in the part in which the fluid is collected, or whether it may not be formed in the general mass of the circulating

And that the difference of specific gravity is mainly owing to the latter, rather than the former cause, may be inferred from the circumstance, that there is not a greater difference in the specific gravity of the blood before the separation of the serum, than in the serum itself. Whence it may be asked, is this dilution of the blood, this augmentation of its

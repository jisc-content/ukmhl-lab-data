473 OBSERVATIONS ON PUS. dence. They have been confirmed generally in two or three instances, in which I have submitted pus of an abscess to analysis. The method of analysis which I have followed has been somewhat different from that used by the ingenious author just quoted. First, The purulent fluid was slowly evaporated to dryness, at a temperature below that of boiling water. The yellow residue of a greasy feel, was then treated with dilute spirit of wine. The solution thus obtained, evaporated, yielded a matter of a light, bright yellow hue, soluble in water, and partially deliquescent, consisting chiefly of saline matter and of ozmazome. Next, pure alcohol was used, and heat employed, nearly to the boiling point. Whilst hot, the solution formed was decanted and evaporated to a small bulk. On cooling, a notable portion of fatty matter was deposited, also of a light yellow hue. The residual fluid decanted and evaporated, yielded only a very little matter of a brown hue, consisting chiefly of fatty matter, mixed, I believe, with a little ozma- zome. The albuminous residue not dissolved either by dilute spirit of wine, or by concentrated alcohol, was in large proportion, compared with the quantity of the substances mentioned, extracted by the spiritu- ous menstrua. The precise proportions of the con- stituent parts, I have not attempted to verify; a

357 AIR ON DEAD ANIMAL MATTER. more numerous. Carbonic acid gas is the princi- pal gaseous one. Sulphuretted hydrogen, and ear- buretted hydrogen, may be occasionally detected. Azote, I believe, is not disengaged, excepting at a very advanced period, when, probably, the products themselves are decomposing. The products not evolved in the gaseous state appear to be chiefly ammonia, kept down in confinement awhile by car- bonic acid and water; and a substance, or matter in a semi-fluid form which has a considerable resem- blance to chyme, and which appears to be the pro- per food of the larvse of many different kinds of the extensive genus Musca,—some preferring the matter from muscle, some from tendon, &c. And this matter itself seems to undergo decomposition, and to be converted into ammonia, and a substance more resembling extractive matter after it has been exposed to the air, than any other with which I am acquainted, excepting one, procurable by the spon- taneous decomposition of some kinds of vinegar to which atmospheric air is allowed to have access. During the decomposition of the vinegar, carbonic acid is formed by the union of carbon with oxygen. The vinegar gradually loses its acidity, and at the same time a pellicle forms on its surface, and gra- dually increasing, becomes a thick, strong, tough, transparent membrane,—elastic, strong, and trans- parent when dry, insoluble in water, and having great power of resisting change, whether acted on by heat, by acids, or alkalies.

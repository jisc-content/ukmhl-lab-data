EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS 2 experiments, to which, considering the nature of the blood, and the accumulated experience of ages relative to the investigation of its properties, there seems to be hardly any limit: at least, we cannot at present discern the limit. One of the distinguished physiologists of the 17th century, Lower, in the dedication of his very original work, De corde, item de Motu et Colore Sanguinis, appears to have thought it necessary to offer some apology to his friend for writing on such a topic : " Mirabuntur alii, forte et ipse miraris, vir ornatissime, de corde et sanguine post viros celebres, qui materiam banc non tantum tractasse sed et exhausisse videantur, a me quicquam amplius proferri." How different is the feeling now; instead of exhausted, the inquiry seems, humanly speaking, rather inexhaus- tible. 1.— Observations to endeavour to determine whether any heat is evolved by the blood in coagulating. Although the remarkable property of coagulation which the blood possesses has been laboriously and carefully investigated, yet, it must be confessed, we know but little respecting it; it is still one of the many mysteries of nature. The little we know on the subject, appears to be chiefly this,—that the phenomenon depends on a portion of the blood, its fibrin, from being liquid, becoming solid, and from being generally diffused in uniform mixture, approxi-

16*4 EXPERIMENTS ON THE BLOOD stances of nitrous oxide and carbonic acid, however, it may be worthy of remark, that the blood which had been agitated with oxygen absorbed less of either of these gases than it did before it was so treated.* The results with phosphuretted hydrogen, the spontaneously inflammable species, were of an am- biguous kind, not sufficiently clear to deduce from them any satisfactory conclusion. In one trial, serum of the venous blood of the sheep absorbed nine per cent, of this gas; venous blood 11*3 per cent.; and arterial 5*8 per cent.f The results with nitrous gas were of a different kind, and may be deserving of being specially noticed. The blood used was that of the sheep prepared in the usual manner. The experiments were made during the very cold weather which prevailed in the beginning of the year already mentioned, and the difference of colour between the venous and arterial blood was very strongly marked. * Nitrous oxide I find is absorbed in about the same proportion by venous and arterial blood, and by the serum of blood, and also in about the same proportion by water. Thus, at the temperature of 45° over mercury, using the blood and serum of the same animal (the sheep), thirty-two measures of each absorbed twenty-two measures of this gas, and thirty-two of distilled water absorbed 21*5. t Supposing the gas decomposed—the phosphorus uniting with the oxygen in the blood, the apparent smaller absorption by arterial than by venous blood is what might be expected, on the idea that the former kind of blood contains most oxygen.

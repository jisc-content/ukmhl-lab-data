300 ACTION OF LIME dust, I believe of Norwegian fir, was put into a bottle, with distilled water and quick-lime (the bottle was about half-filled with the mixture), and corked. Another portion of saw-dust was put into a bottle with water, and corked, but without the addition of lime. Examined on the 1st November 1838, the saw- dust with the lime had no appearance of any material change ; its colour perhaps was a little heightened ; the water only just perceptibly coloured; it had a strong taste of lime ; evaporated to dryness it af- forded a light yellow residue, consisting chiefly of lime ; the proportion of vegetable matter was hardly appreciable. The other portion examined, after the same interval, also exhibited very little change; a muci- laginous film had formed over the submerged stratum of saw-dust, too delicate and small in quantity to be collected and examined in a satisfactory manner ; the saw-dust retained its colour, and the water was colourless. The water, evaporated to dryness, yielded a very minute brownish residue, slightly bitter, which had no effect either on litmus or tur- meric paper. No smell was perceived on opening the cork of either bottle. On the 17th June, 1836, some clover leaf and flower, and some leaf of the common mallow were put into a bottle with quick lime and water; the bottle was corked and the cork was covered with sealing wax. The quick lime used was tested for

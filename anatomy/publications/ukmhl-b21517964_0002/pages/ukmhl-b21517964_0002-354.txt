342 ON THE AGENCY OF ATMOSPHERIC contiguous. At 6 p.m. of the same day, when the temperature of the water was 78°, that of the blood was 80°, and its odour was peculiar and rather offen- sive. On the 21st, when the water was 79°, the blood was the same as the day preceding. On the 22d, when the water was 80°, the blood at the sur- face was 82°, and a little below the surface 81°. Its smell was offensive and ammoniacal, and its li- quidity was increased. On the 23d, the tempera- ture of the blood was the same as that of the water; and so it continued, whilst slowly undergoing de- composition. The colouring matter of blood.—About two pounds of the colouring matter of the blood of an ox, from which the fibrin had been separated in the usual way by agitation, but not deprived of serum, was exposed to observation on the 19th of August. It was examined once or twice daily. Its temperature never rose perceptibly above that of the water. On the 22d, it had an offensive smell, and mixed with lime, gave off an ammoniacal odour. In a few days the odour became more strongly ammoniacal and less offensive; and so it continued afterwards, whilst gradually undergoing the changes peculiar to its very slow decomposition. Serum of blood.—The observations which I have made on the putrefactive decomposition of this fluid, do not indicate any sensible elevation of temperature attending it; a result, which might be expected, considering that its putrid changes take place very

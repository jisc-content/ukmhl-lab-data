OBSERVATIONS ON PUS. 466 siderably variable. I sball state some of tbe results which I have obtained. i. —From the pleura, in the case already referred to, of empyema, complicated with pneumathorax, it was of specific gravity 1028; it was pus of good quality and ordinary consistence, " Album, leve et aBquale." ii. —From an abscess in the thigh, not quite equable, its specific gravity was 1031. iii. — From the axilla, in convalescence from erysipelas, pretty equable, of moderate consistence; it was of specific gravity 1029. iv. —From the arm, also in convalescence from erysipelas of a dangerous character, (before alluded to, as well as the last,) its specific gravity was 1036. v. —From an abscess in the back of a young man, its specific gravity was 1040 ; it had a slight reddish tinge, and, under the microscope, was found to con- tain a very few blood corpuscles. vi. —From a large cavity in the lung in a fatal case of pulmonary consumption, its specific gravity was 1042 ; it was rather thicker than the healthy pus of an abscess. vii. —From a vomica in the lung, in another fatal case of pulmonary consumption, it was of specific gravity 1021. the specific gravity of the pus, and of the serum of the blood of two individuals; in one, that the pus was of specific gravity 1031, the serum was of specific gravity 1029 ; and in the other in which the former was 1033, the latter was 1031.—Phil.

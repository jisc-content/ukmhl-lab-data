444 ON THE MALE ORGANS OF SOME on the inner side of each bladder, a cream-like fluid was discharged into the cloaca through the papilla, —the termination of the urinary, and, as I believe, seminal ducts. This fluid under the microscope was found to abound in animalcules, mixed with a few globules, both similar to those last-mentioned ; the former in active motion. Next, the vas deferens was opened into, before it passes behind the urinary bladder, and some fluid was obtained from it, not inconsiderable in quantity, and of the colour nearly and consistence of cream. Under the microscope, it was found to abound in animalcules, of a thread-like form, having one ex- tremity excessively fine, very active in movement; their motion vibratory, as well as progressive; in every respect closely resembling those of the thornback; and like them, — owing to their vast number, and being intermixed with many globules, to be seen distinctly, the fluid required to be diluted. The globular testis was next cut into ; a portion of it was removed by a horizontal incision. It abounded in fluid, more liquid than that of the vas deferens, and less opaque. Under the microscope, many animalcules were seen in it, precisely similar to those of the vas deferens,—but not in motion, as if dead; and mixed with them were many globules of different sizes, the largest about the size of pus- globules, a few blood corpuscles and some fragments of irregular form. Lastly, an incision was made into the lower non-

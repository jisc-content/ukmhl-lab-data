442 ON THE MALE ORGANS OF SOME was of the appearance and nearly of the consistence of cream. Under the microscope, it was found to abound in animalcules, in active motion, mixed with globules of different sizes. They were best seen when the fluid was diluted with a solution of common salt. The animalcules were proportionally of great length, not unlike portions of fine hair; one extremity was of extreme fineness and seen with difficulty. Their motion was serpentine and vibratory, and when most active, extremely quick, especially the tapering part. Next I examined the fluid from the vas deferens, taken from its commencement, just after leaving the body of the epididymis. Its appearance to the naked eye and its character under the microscope were very similar to those of the preceding. It abounded in the same animalcules, also in active motion, many of them grouped together in bundles, and which so joined side by side, acted together ;â€” the tapering part, in which the approximation was greatest, moving with great velocity, in a vibratory manner. Lastly, I examined the fluid yielded by the glo- bular testis, procured by making an incision into its substance, and gently scraping the cut surface. The small quantity of fluid thus obtained was opaque, but not so thick as the preceding. Under the mi- croscope, it was found to contain animalcules similar to those before-mentioned, and in motion ; but less

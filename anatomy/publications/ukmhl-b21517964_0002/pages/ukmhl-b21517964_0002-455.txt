OF THE CARTILAGINOUS FISHES. 443 numerous and not grouped; intermixed with small globular masses of an obscure granular and radiated structure. 3.â€” Of the Male Organs of the common Skate (Rata batis). On the 8th of November under the same favour- able circumstances, I examined a male fish of the above species, in which the generative organs were fully developed, and which generally in no respect essentially differed so far as I could observe from those of the thornback. In this instance, for the sake of as much accuracy as possible, I began with an inspection of the fluids, likely to throw light on the functions of the genera- tive organs. The fluid first subjected to the microscope was some contained in the cavity of the abdomen. It was transparent with a small opaque sediment; and was found to contain globules of different sizes, the largest less than common pus-globules, and a few elliptical blood particles, without any animalcules. The fluid next collected was that contained in the urinary bladders. It was nearly colourless and lim- pid. Under the microscope, many small globules were visible in it, about one-half the size of pus- globules and a few animalcules resembling those of the thornback, and yet not precisely similar.

IN CONNEXION WITH RESPIRATION. 167 just described indicate that a portion of oyxgen exists in the blood, not capable of being extracted by the air-pump, and yet capable of entering into combination with nitrous gas, and which exists in largest proportion in arterial blood? Unless this conclusion is adopted, it must be supposed either that the nitrous gas which disappears is decomposed, or that it combines directly with the red particles; neither of which suppositions is well supported by facts. The circumstance that no azote is disengaged, is not favourable to the idea that the nitrous gas is decomposed; and the difference of effect in the in- stances of venous and arterial blood, and, after and before agitation with oxygen, is not in accordance with the notion of direct combination. I may men- tion another fact which seems to have the same bearing: serum, which does not absorb oxygen, I find also does not absorb nitrous gas, excepting in about the proportion in which water absorbs it: and, further, in corroboration, I may mention, that as blood putrefies, whether arterial or venous, its power of absorbing nitrous gas diminishes; and that it is also diminished by being agitated with phosphuretted hydrogen. Thus the arterial blood of a sheep, which before agitation with phosphuretted hydrogen ab- sorbed 45*3 per cent, of nitrous gas, after agitation with it absorbed 7'4 per cent, less ; and, after it had become putrid, it absorbed twenty per cent. less. According to my observations, arterial blood does not lose its peculiar florid hue under the action of

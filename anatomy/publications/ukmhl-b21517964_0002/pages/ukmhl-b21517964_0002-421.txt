DIFFERENT TEXTURES OF THE HUMAN BODY. 409 sometimes apparently retarded, and sometimes ap- parently accelerated. These remarks apply chiefly to the perichondrium of the cartilages of the ribs, and the periosteum of the cylindrical bones. The perichondrium and periosteum of other parts, ac- cording to a variety of circumstances, suffer altera- tion variously, and especially according to their de- gree of thickness; thus, when very thin and loose resembling cellular membrane, the periosteum of the lower jaw disintegrates rather rapidly, like the adjoining cellular membrane, from which it is ex- tremely difficult to distinguish it, and to say where the one begins, and the other terminates. Cartilage, (4. 10.)—From the observations which I have made, cartilage, and fibro-cartilage appear on maceration to undergo slowly a very similar change, and to waste away gradually from being converted into a mucus-like substance. During the change, the colours which I have witnessed in some parts have been various and extremely bright; especially in the cartilage of the symphysis pubis; I have seen it vividly coloured partially brown, orange, blue, green, and yellow. Bone, (4. 10.)—This structure undergoes change from maceration very slowly, especially the com- pact bones which contain few vessels and little blood. Changing the water frequently, the animal matter appears to be slowly removed; for there is a con- stant exudation of a mucus-like substance on the surface, and the brittleness of the bone gradually

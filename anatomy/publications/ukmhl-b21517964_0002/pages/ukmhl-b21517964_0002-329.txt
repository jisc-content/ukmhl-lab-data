TEXTURES OF THE HUMAN BODY. 317 scalding agency, subjecting them, on each occasion, as nearly as possible, to the same degree of pressure between folds of blotting paper before weighing them. The results obtained are shewn in the fol- lowing table. Texture Tried. Specific Gravity before Scalding. Specific Gravity after Scalding. Spleen 1041 1060 Dura mater . 1047* 1058 Pericardium . 1059 1074 Lower portion of thoracic aorta 1065 1075 Ditto, just below the arch de- prived of its outer coat 1070 1072 These results wTould seem to shew that condensa- tion attends the contraction,—that the bulk of the part acted on is actually diminished. This is also indicated, and I apprehend very clearly, by the effect on certain parts,—especially on the penis,— which, perhaps from its structure, is better adapted than any other to display it. Under the influence of boiling water, this organ becomes hard, and tense, and rounded; and from the blood pressed outy evi- dently of diminished volume. * This low specific gravity of dura mater, was probably the effect of disease; in the body from which it was taken fluid was found effused between the membranes.

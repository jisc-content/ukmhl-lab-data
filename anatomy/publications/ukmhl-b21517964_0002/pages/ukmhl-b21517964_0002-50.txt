EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS 38 from disease alone, whilst the rebellion lasted, was about 25 per cent, of the strength. Besides the specific gravity of the blood or serum, in many in- stances I ascertained that of the bile; which I have thought it right to give, although not strictly be- longing to the present subject. All the cases referred to, with the exception of the Singalese, who were camp followers employed as coolies or porters, were men belonging to our regiments, serving in Ceylon, the Negroes and Malays to the 1st Ceylon regiment, the others to the 19th, 73d, and 83d foot. The Negroes were Africans, of Mozambique; the Malays were natives of Java, or the adjoining islands ; the men belonging to the other regiments were either English, Scotch, or Irish. As regards the general scope of the results, some plausible inferences perhaps might be drawn from them, in relation not only to the effects of disease on the circulating fluids, but also on the influence of climate, variety of race, &c. But I think it best to abstain from the attempt, considering the basis of facts as too slender for a foundation for theoretical views. As facts, however, bearing on an important part of pathology, few and im- perfect as they are, I have thought it right to bring them forward, even after the lapse of twenty years, with the hope that they may not be altogether use- less in themselves, and that they may lead to further inquiry.

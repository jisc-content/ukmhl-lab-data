OF THE CARTILAGINOUS FISHES. 459 number, amongst whom M. De Blainville is eminent, seem to have returned to the older notion that they are penes. Bloch's argument against their being penes is founded on their structure, in his opinion, totally unfit for their supposed office. Those who maintain the opinion he opposes, lay stress on the appearance of the fluid secreted by the gland belonging to each appendage, so much re- sembling the spermatic fluid, and on the analogy in certain of the reptiles of a double oviduct and dou- ble penis. Objections, it appears to me, are una- voidable to both of these views;—as regards the latter, it is highly improbable, that there should be two sources of spermatic fluid ; in fact that there should be four testes: moreover it has appeared, that the fluid of the appendages is without the cha- racteristic quality of the spermatic fluid, containing no entozoa, and seeming to be of a peculiar kind. As regards Bloch's view, it seems improbable, were the appendages designed for prehension, that they should be furnished with a gland, copiously secreting a lubricating fluid :—nor does their general structure or situation appear to be apposite for the purpose he imagines, especially as he is of opinion that the papilla of the male, its rudimentary penis, is applied in the act of impregnating to the surface of the cloaca, where the mouths of the oviduct or uterine cavities open. Reflecting on the subject, and on the inadequacy of former hypotheses, it has occurred to me, as pos-

IN CONNEXION WITH RESPIRATION. 157 instant the stopper was replaced, with some mercury, introduced with the distilled water, and equally de- prived of adhering air. In about half an hour from the abstraction of the blood, in every instance, it was subjected to the air- pump. The instant the stopper was withdrawn the vial was placed in a small receiver on the plate of the pump, and covered with a little larger receiver, and the air as soon as possible exhausted. No ap- pearance of disengagement of gas was perceptible until the exhaustion was nearly complete; then it was sudden, sometimes considerable, even to over- flowing, in the form of bubbles, and it continued some time. The results were not distinctly different, that I could perceive, whether venous or arterial blood was used; I am disposed to think, on the whole, that less air was disengaged from the arterial blood than from the venous. When blood allowed to coagulate in the vessels was tried, the results varied a little, and appeared to me instructive. At first, on exhaustion, only a few particles of air were disengaged; no more, it might be supposed, than were derived from the con- tact of the end of the stopper. In two experiments such was the appearance for at least five minutes, conveying the idea that no air was extricated ; then abruptly a bubble or film burst with some force, as was denoted by the scattering of the particles of blood; and a bubbling commenced and continued, rendering the indications of extrication of gas un-

363 AIR ON DEAD ANIMAL MATTER. killed, and which I have made in relation to this point, has not been less conclusive. In one instance, I had a hungry dog, fed at three different times, during the twenty-four hours with fresh beef. Three hours after the last feeding, he was killed. All the meat given him had disappeared, excepting the last meal; and the portions of beef of which it con- sisted, were very little altered: yet, triturated with hydrate of lime, they gave off a distinct ammoniacal odour,—so did a little whitish chyme in the pyloric extremity of the stomach; the chyme in the duode- num gave it off more strongly; a thin yellowish fluid in the ileum not less so; and the contents of the large intestines in a hardly less degree. I ex- amined the blood, both venous and arterial, the chyle, the bile, and several of the solid parts; but none of them afforded, by the test of lime, the slightest trace of ammonia, not even the kidneys, although the urine abounded in ammoniacal salts, and emitted on the addition of lime a most powerful ammoniacal odour. These circumstances seem in harmony with the old hypothesis—that putrefaction is concerned in digestion. In opposition, many facts may be stated, tending to shew, that digestion is a specific action, or series of actions,—that its phenomena are vital, or in other words, peculiar, mysterious, and inexplicable accord- ing to the present state of our knowledge. Many of the results of the experiments of Spallanzani, and Stephens, are of this character. Contrary to

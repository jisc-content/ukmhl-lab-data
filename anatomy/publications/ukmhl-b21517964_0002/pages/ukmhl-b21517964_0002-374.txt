362 ON THE AGENCY OF ATMOSPHERIC much as of fermentation. The other gases, as sulphuretted hydrogen, and carburetted hydrogen, occasionally evolved during the putrid changes, are frequently generated in the alimentary canal; and, the contents of the stomach, and of the whole in- testines are seldom, I believe, destitute of ammonia. In relation to this last mentioned product of the putrid fermentation, I may mention, that whenever I have sought for it after death, either in the human stomach, or in the duodenum, jejunum, or ileum, I have always found it; and I need not add, that I have always found it in the large intestines, and in instances in which the post mortem examination was made before there were any indications of putrefac- tion having commenced in the solids or fluids generally, and when ammonia could not be detected either in the blood,* the bile, the brain, or the mus- cles. The result of the examination of animals just * In the trials referred to above, the blood and other parts were mixed with quicklime, and the absence of ammonia was inferred, if no ammoniacal odour was perceptible. Recently, I have had re- course to a severer test of the volatile alkali, viz. bringing near the mixture under trial, a glass rod moistened with muriatic acid, so diluted, that no fumes were produced, merely by aqueous vapour. Using this means, in every instance, I have detected ammonia in the blood, even when it has been extracted from the body very soon after death. The degree of effect, however, has very much varied • in some cases, in which the blood-particles appeared under the microscope very little, if at all altered,—the indications of ammonia afforded were only just perceptible: on the contrary, when the colouring matter of the blood was partially dissolved in the serum, and the forms of the blood-particles were altered, then the indications of ammonia were strong.

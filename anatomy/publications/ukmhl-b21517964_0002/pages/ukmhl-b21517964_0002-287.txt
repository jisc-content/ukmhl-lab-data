OF WATER IN DIFFERENT TEXTURES. 275 are only temporary; as soon as humidity is restored, flexibility is also restored, and the tendency to putre- faction and decomposition returns, and apparently unimpaired by suspension. This property of desic- cation in animal matter, and in vegetables also, though it has been long applied to economical pur- poses, for the preservation of articles of food, has not, perhaps, been used so much as it deserves; nor has the principle, I believe, been applied as generally as it might be, to the solution of certain phenomena, strictly chemical, which occur in nature and art. Does it not serve to explain a fact which, on first consideration, seems not a little extraordinary, that meat will remain fresh for many days in Egypt, if hung up in the open air, and exposed to sunshine and wind, in the hottest weather; whilst it putrefies in a few hours, if confined in a close damp place ? Does it not afford equally an explanation of the opposite effects in the Mediterranean, on dead animal matter, of the south-east or sirocco wind, and of the north and north-east winds of which a re- markable example has already been given, witnessed in Ipsara ? The former wind, almost saturated with moisture, produces little or no evaporation or desic- cating effect; whilst the latter, deficient in moisture, and sometimes in an extraordinary degree deficient, occasion rapid evaporation, and powerfully desiccate; the one acting like confined moist air of high tem- perature, and greatly promoting putrefaction ; the other operating like the dry wind of the desert, t 2

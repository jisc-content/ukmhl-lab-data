380 ON THE MACERATION IN WATER OF that the thin muscular substance of the auricles un- derwent change less rapidly than that of the ventri- cles. Other muscular parts of the body were sub- jected to maceration; some of them, as the substance of the tongue, and most of the voluntary muscles exhibited rapid change, like the ventricles of the heart; others, as the muscular coat of the primae viae, and especially of the rectum, and of the urinary bladder, more resembled the auricles of the heart in the slow manner in which they underwent alteration. Brain. (1.)—This organ rapidly becomes soft in water, and forms with it a kind of emulsion, the consistence of which varies of course with the pro- portion of each. In the state of emulsion it has a peculiar and disagreeable odour, but neither fetid nor ammoniacal. As the water cannot be changed, I do not consider it necessary to give here any par- ticulars of the alterations which take place in the mixture left undisturbed for a considerable time. Spleen. (6. 7. 8.10.)—It became soft very rapidly according to circumstances of temperature, &c. in a space of time varying from twenty-four hours to three or four days. When an incision was made into it and gentle pressure applied under water, the softened matter (very like that from fibrin, coloured by the colouring matter of blood) flowed out, fetid, and mixed with some air bubbles ; and when it was softened throughout its mass, the operation of press- ing it gently being continued under water, the whole of the softened matter was expressed, and nothing

250 THE AGE OF MORBID ADHESIONS ; liquor pericardii. But, were the fluid a post mortem exudation, it might be expected, that coagulable lymph would be very frequently observed in it, inas- much as in the majority of instances the blood is slow in coagulating; a portion of it is commonly found liquid in the heart very many hours after death, and which coagulates on exposure. 4. The gall-bladder distended with bile, the uri- nary-bladder with urine, in fatal cases of apoplexy or palsy, the synovial membranes with synovia, part with their contents with extreme slowness. In no instance have I ever met with synovia in the cellular tissue adjoining the capsule of a joint abounding in synovia. I am not aware of urine having ever been found in appreciable quantity in the cavity of the pelvis after death with distension of bladder.* How small is the exudation from the gall-bladder, and how slow in taking place. Were it not for its colour- ing quality, the exudation would not be appreciable. If these views be correct, the question of permea- bility of membranes and exudation of fluids in con- sequence, need not greatly embarrass the patholo- * On the 11th October, 16 ounces of a weak solution of triple prus- siate of potash (strong enough, however, to become dark-blue when mixed with a salt of iron) were injected into the urinary-bladder of a young man two hours after death from pulmonary consumption. The post mortem examination was made 24 hours after; the cavity of the abdomen was first opened into and carefully examined; the only fluid found was in the pelvis, between the bladder and rectum, not quite half an ounce, and, tested by iron, no trace of the prussiate could be detected in it; it appeared to be a weak serous fluid,â€”it was rendered turbid by nitric acid. !

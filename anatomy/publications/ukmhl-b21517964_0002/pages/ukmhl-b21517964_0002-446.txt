434 DUCTUS COMMUNIS CHOLEDOCHUS ; Experiment 4th. After having laid open the duodenum, and emptied the gall bladder, by a small opening in its fundus, which was closed by ligature, injected water gently through the hepatic duct, it rose more freely in the gall bladder than it passed into the duodenum. Experiment 5th. Placed the body in such a position that the gall bladder was raised above the level of the mouth of the common duct, and injected water as before. Now it flowed into the duodenum, but did not enter the gall bladder. Experiment 6th. The body lying on its back, injected water forci- bly, and with various degrees of force; it flowed freely into the intestine, and rose in the gall bladder so as to fill it nearly one-third full,—and to the same extent whatever was the degree of force employed; and which appeared to be (as well as could be judged by the eye) the level of the mouth of the duct, supposing a horizontal line to be drawn from it to the gall-bladder. Whether there is any vital, peculiar force regu- lating the expansion and contraction of the mouth of the common duct, and consequently the flow of the bile, it is difficult to determine. That mechanical causes must operate powerfully can hardly be doubted:—the results which I have described seem

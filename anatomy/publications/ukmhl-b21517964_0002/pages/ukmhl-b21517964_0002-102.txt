MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS 90 the sides of the glass, by careful cleaning, and wip- ing, and rinsing it out, previous to the admission of the blood, with distilled water, which had been purged of air. In this instance, no bubbles of gas appeared in the blood on exhaustion, and the coagu- lation took place a little later than in another portion of blood exposed to the air. There was no differ- ence of colour between them. In the paper in which the general results of these experiments were given, and which was published in the Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal, vol. xxx, for 1828,—I further stated that I found no material effect produced on the coagulation of the blood, by receiving it as it flowed from the arm into oil, which had been previously deprived of air by the air-pump, whether under the influence of atmo- spheric pressure in the open air, or excluded from it, under an exhausted receiver. Turning back to the notes of these experiments, I find it remarked, that the blood coagulated slower under the oil (whether under pressure or not) than when exposed to the air;—and that, in the former, a much thicker buffy coat formed, than on the latter. This result accords with others which I had obtained several years previously in Ceylon ; and also with the results of the later experiments of Dr. Benjamin Babington, on the effects of oil.* Probably it is, in part, connected with the cooling effects of the • Med.-Chirurg.

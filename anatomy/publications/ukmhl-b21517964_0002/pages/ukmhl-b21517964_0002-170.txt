158 EXPERIMENTS ON THE BLOOD questionable. And in conformity with this result I may remark, I have never succeeded in obtaining indications of air in the blood in operating on it by the air-pump, if confined in a detached portion of vein, or in the heart of animals, the great vessels, previous to excision, having been tightly secured by ligature. In no instance of this kind have I wit- nessed any distention, such as occurs if air be ad- mitted previous to the application of the ligatures: clearly indicative, it appears to me, that a very slight compressing force is sufficient to confine the air in the blood; or rather, I should say, prevent its substance assuming the elastic state; and further, the probability, that the quantity of air so con- densed is small. I have stated that in the majority of instances the indications of the disengagement of air from blood in vacuo have been manifest. Exceptions, however, have occurred, and those clear and decisive; indu- cing me to believe that the quantity of air condensed in the blood is variable; and that there are times when it is in excess, and times when in deficiency, and when totally wanting, connected with regularly changing states of the functional system. I hope at a future time to be able to recur to this part of the subject, on which at present I have collected but a few facts. I may add, that such facts tend in part to reconcile some of the discrepancies referred to in the beginning of this section.

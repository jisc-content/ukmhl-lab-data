100 MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS and sarsaparilla, the common extract of cinchona, magnesia, carbonate of magnesia, sulphate of zinc, tartarized antimony, supertartrate of potash, triple prussiate of potash, muriate of barytes, nitrate of barytes, borax, common salt, nitre, sal-ammoniac, the sesquicarbonate of ammonia, the carbonate of soda, sulphate of ammonia, aqua ammonia?, aqua potassse, distilled vinegar. The effects of the substances arranged under this second class, individually considered, are still more various than those of the first. Most of them pro- duced a thickening, and increased the viscidity of the blood. The former was especially the effect of the vegetable substances, and the latter of some of the salts, particularly borax and carbonate of soda. Very few of the substances tried had a contrary effect; it was well marked only in a few instances, as in those of the triple prussiate of potash, cream of tartar, tartarized antimony, magnesia, and carbonate of magnesia, with each of which the red particles rapidly subsided ; no coagulation took place, and the fibrin remained completely dissolved in the serum. In some instances, and that the majority, owing to the thickening of the blood, or the increased viscidity imparted, the red particles were kept sus- pended. In a very few, as in those of distilled vinegar, aqua ammonia?, and aqua potassa?, they were dissolved. The difference of effect, as to change of colour, was very various indeed ; most commonly the colour was darkened, â€” in a very few instances

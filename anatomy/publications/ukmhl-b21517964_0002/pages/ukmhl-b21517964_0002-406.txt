394 ON MACERATION IN WATER OF Stomach, (4.)—During the first eight or nine days there was no distinct softening or change of any part of this viscus. About the twelfth day, the mucous membrane was softening in some places, and was easily abraded from the subjacent cellular layer. This layer, where the mucous coat was removed from it, had the appearance of peritoneal membrane. Its tissue was considerably distended with water. The muscular, and peritoneal coats were of a light pink hue. About the eighteenth day, the mucous coat was soft and slimy, and when gently rubbed, was readily detached. About the thirty-fifth day, the mu- cous coat was slimy, and of the weakest consistence ; in many places eroded. The adjoining cellular coat, of a fibrinous reticulated appearance, white and of a silky lustre, had lost much of its strength, and was softening. The muscular coat was not every where distinct; where distinct, there cellular tissue appeared intermixed with it, and it was red- dish, and extremely feeble. The peritoneal coat, externally light brown, internally white and silky, was also softening. On the forty-fifth day the change was in progress in all the tissues ; and on the seventy- second the disintegration was nearly complete ; and it was difficult to recognise any of the coats or layers, excepting the submucous, which, though almost de- prived of coherence, yet was still pretty distinct; and the larger vessels passing through it were also distinct, but in the same soft weak state.

EXPERIMENTS ON THE BLOOD 176 The results of the experiments which I have already given, appear to me no wise reconcilable with this theory of Dr. Stevens ; but perfectly in accordance with the older views which he controverts. Of this description is the fact, that venous blood does not acquire the arterial hue when acted on by the air-pump, even when carbonic acid gas is disengaged; and that venous blood does acquire it, from the ab- sorption of oxygen, without the disengagement of carbonic acid ; and acquires it even when agitated with a mixture of carbonic acid gas and oxygen gas, absorbing a small portion of the latter, and a large portion of the former. I apprehend, that the circumstances which Dr. Stevens has brought forward in support of his argu- ment admit of explanation consistent with the com- monly received opinion of the part performed by oxygen in respiration. I shall mention a few, the more important of them, with others tending, as I believe, to elucidate the subject. matter ; but when this agent is diffused in a saline fluid, such as the serum, it is of a bright scarlet tint, which is in fact the natural colour of arterial blood. When carbonic acid is added to this blood in the extreme circulation, it becomes dark-red; but when this acid is removed in the pulmonary organs, the blood then resumes its natural scarlet or arterial colour; and this, as I have said, is produced not directly by oxygen, but chiefly, if not entirely by the action of the salts of the blood on the colouring matter. Oxygen, it is true, changes the colour from venous to arterial: this, however, is effected, not by any specific action, but by the removal of the carbonic acid, which had been the cause of the dark colour in the venous circu- lation."

284 ACTION OF CORROSIVE SUBLIMATE sublimate combines with the textures generally, or with any one texture entirely. Probably it unites only with a part of each, that part on which putre- faction chiefly depends, and which it may be con- jectured, is essentially albuminous, and not very different in its nature from the albumen ovi, for which the chloride has a strong affinity. The pro- portionally increased weight of the fibrinous con- cretion, of the liver, and muscle, is in favour of this conclusion. It may be asked, does corrosive sublimate com- bine directly with albumen—as from the manner of expressing my opinion in the last paragraph, seems to be taken for granted ? My belief is, that it does so combine. This was the original view of Dr. Bostock, as stated in his ingenious paper on animal fluids, published in Nicholson's Journal for June 1806, in which it is also taken for granted as most natural, and in accordance with facts. It appears to me preferable to the later conclusion of M. Orfila, that the compound precipitated from white of egg by corrosive sublimate, consists of calomel and albumen; and preferable also to the more recent conclusion of Rose, that it is composed of albumen and oxide of mercury. Orfila drew his inference from the products of the destructive dis- tillation of the compound,*—results ill adapted for forming an opinion on the subject. Moreover, at that time, viz. in 1814, the old hypothesis respect- * Traite des Poisons, torn. 1.—Part I. p. 47.

480 OBSERVATIONS ON PUS. blood, and be poured out merely where it is found collected. The phenomena of ulcers are favourable to the first view; and seem at least to prove, that in certain cases, its origin is local, and that it is formed in the part where it presents itself. On the other hand, the collections of pus which so often occur in erysipelas, in deeply seated parts, remote from the cutaneous inflammation, and without symp- toms of corresponding local inflammation, favour the latter view. This view is also favoured by the detection of globules resembling pus-globules in the blood, during the process of suppuration,â€”whether in instances of superficial suppuration, as in small pox, or in deeply seated, as in tubercular phthisis, or lumbar abscess ; and the analogy which there is in a certain degree between the puriloid matter, occasion- ally found in masses of fibrin, in the cavities of the heart and of the great vessels, seems to me likewise to support it. Inquiry now is happily directed to pyogenesis, and with the aids which the collateral sciences are capable of affording, there is good ground for hope, that its termination will be success- ful ; and if successful, that it may be the commence- ment of a new era in pathology.

IN CONNEXION WITH RESPIRATION. 149 blood of a sheep, twenty measures of gas were added over mercury, composed of about equal parts of oxygen and carbonic acid. After agitation about seventeen measures were absorbed, and the blood had acquired a florid hue; ten measures more of oxygen were added ; there was no further absorp- tion. The tube was transferred to lime-water and agitated ; the residual air was not diminished ; it amounted to thirteen or fourteen measures (the froth prevented precision in marking the quantity), which possessed the properties of oxygen, as tested by the taper. To twenty-eight measures of venous blood of a sheep, which had absorbed twenty-six of carbonic acid, forty-nine of oxygen were added in the gradu- ated tube over mercury : after agitation the blood had acquired the florid arterial hue, and there ap- peared to be an expansion of one measure. Trans- ferred to lime-water there was an absorption of one or two measures, and no more. I shall notice one experiment more, in which blood oearly saturated with carbonic acid was exposed to oxygen, a membrane intervening. Forty-seven measures of venous blood, which had absorbed thirty- three of carbonic acid, were introduced into a glass tube half an inch in diameter, closed at one end with gold-beaters' skin, and when filled with blood, at the other end also; it was placed over mercury in a small receiver, and thirty-seven measures of oxygen were added to it, under a diminished pressure of about one

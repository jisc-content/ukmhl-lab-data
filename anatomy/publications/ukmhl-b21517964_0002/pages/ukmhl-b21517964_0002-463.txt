OF THE CARTILAGINOUS FISHES. 451 about three feet long, the gland was nearly the size of a chestnut, (vide PI. iii. Fig. 1.) of a very elon- gated oval form, divided on one side, as it were into two columns, by a superficial furrow or depression, in which were two rows of delicate projecting tubuli, the extremities of its excretory ducts. The substance of the gland was enveloped in a muscular coat, and this was covered with a vascular tissue. The gland itself was contained in a sac, composed of three coats—an inner fibrous, a middle muscular, and an outer cellular one ; and was sur- rounded with strong muscles—the principal flexor and extensor muscles of the organ.* Moreover, at the inferior extremity of the sac, just below its outlet, was a distinct cavity formed of muscular walls, and intersected by delicate tendinous fibres. (Vide Fig. 2. PI. iii.) In one instance, when under examination, the fish was still irritable, its mus- cles acting when stimulated; and then this part, pulsated regularly and vigorously. It contained blood; and I believe it to be an auxiliary heart designed for circulating the blood in the appended * Bloch, in his description of these organs, describes only two muscles; but there are more; some connecting the organ with the pelvis, others attached to the principal bones, and others to the small bones: which is as might be expected, — considering that eleven bones and a terminal cartilage enter into the composition of each organ. This number I found in the instance of the thornback» Bloch states, that in this fish they are eight. Hist. Nat. des Pois- sons, iii. 672. Q G 2

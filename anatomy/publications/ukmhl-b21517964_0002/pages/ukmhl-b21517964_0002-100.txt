88 MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS ' Op. cit. p. 22. quantity of this acid gas; or if it did absorb it, it ought not to coagulate ; and indeed it ought not to coagulate, though it did not absorb it, so long as it was in an atmosphere of carbonic acid gas and so long as it retained the proportion of gas supposed to belong to it. Were there not a consistency in nature, there could be no science. Is it not a con- tradiction, that the blood, a fluid not saturated with carbonic acid, capable of combining with a fresh portion, should contain free carbonic acid, and be capable of giving it off". I speak of the blood out of the body, as of a bone or muscle, detached from the animal, deprived of life, and subject to the same laws as ordinary dead matter. Farther on, I shall recur to the important points,—the carbonic acid in the blood, and the absorption of oxygen by the blood, with which are involved so much of physiological doctrine. 9-—On the Effect of removing Atmospheric Pres- sure from the Blood, and of excluding Atmo- spheric Air. According to Sir Charles Scudamore, blood co- agulates in vacuo more rapidly than in the open air, and becomes of a considerably darker colour.* I have tried this experiment repeatedly, and the result apparently has been negative. The blood which coagulated under the exhausted receiver, was of the

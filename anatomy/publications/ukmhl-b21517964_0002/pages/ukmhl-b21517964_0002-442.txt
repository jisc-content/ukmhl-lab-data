430 DUCTUS COMMUNIS CHOLEDOCHUS ; ventes of the spiral intestine of the cartilaginous fishes.* In the turkey, two or more hepatic ducts enter the intestine direct and apart ; terminating in the form almost of capillary tubes, prominent and flexi- ble with extremely small orifices, in appearance not unlike the membranous terminal portion of the urethra of the ram projecting from the corpus spon- giosum, they are without a valvular structure. In the ray (raia batis) the structure of the biliary duct, where it passes obliquely through the coats of the intestine, near the pyloric end of the stomach, is distinctly valvular, exhibiting transverse folds or plates, offering resistance backwards only contrary to the course of the bile. Besides the use assigned to the valvular pro- cesses in man, to prevent the reflux of the fluids which the biliary and pancreatic ducts are designed to discharge, they may be auxiliary also, towards two other objects, viz. in offering an impediment to the contents of the duodenum entering the common duct,—and in retarding the flow of the bile from the liver into the intestine, and so promoting at cer- tain times its passing into the gall bladder. * In the horse the hepatic and pancreatic duct terminate in a sinus or pouch-like cavity, which may be considered as belonging to the intestine,—not unlike in its conformation the cavity of the caput galinaginis of the human urethra. In the elephant their termination is very similar : the mouth of the sinus is circular and sufficiently large to admit the end of the little finger; the cavity is cup-like within.

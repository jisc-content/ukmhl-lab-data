288 ACTION OF CORROSIVE SUBLIMATE posit was in one instance mixed with a little fat and other animal matter. From a set of experiments which I made on cor- rosive sublimate in 1822, and which were pub- lished in the Philosophical Transactions for that year, I shewed, that under certain circumstances of complicated affinity, corrosive sublimate is very apt to be decomposed by exposure to light and calomel precipitated; and that the effect may be prevented by adding a substance which has a strong affinity for the chloride, such as muriatic acid, or muriate of ammonia, in a saturated solution of the latter of which, it was, I found, seventeen times more soluble than in water alone. Such complicated affinities I have no doubt were exercised in occasioning the precipitation of calomel, in the instances of the spoilt preparations to which I have alluded: and it is highly probable that the bad effects might have been prevented by certain pre- cautions, tending to oppose those affinities, as by immersing them after steeping in the chloride solu- tion in dilute muriatic acid, or in a solution of muriate of ammonia; or placing them immediately in a compound solution of the muriate and chloride. The few experiments I have made of this mixture have given favourable results; but they have not been carried sufficiently far, or made with sufficient precision to enable me to give a decided opinion on its permanent efficacy. This I regret, considering the cheapness of the means, and the promise of

MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS 80 6.â€” Of the Effect of different kinds of Vessels on the Coagulation of the Blood. It is generally supposed, that the kind of vessel in which the blood is received, its size, form, and quality, have a considerable influence in promoting or retarding its coagulation and the formation of a buffy coat. I have made many experiments to en- deavour to ascertain the truth of this opinion ; but I have not yet been able to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion. I am rather disposed to think that wood and polished metals retard coagulation, and that glass and earthenware accelerate it. The form and size of the vessel will, of course, have some influence, were it merely in connexion with temperature. The remarks which I have made relative to the difficulty of ascertaining the effect of moderate motion on the blood, are particularly applicable here; and, d fortiori, as the effect of the quality of the vessels I have tried, is even more ambiguous than that of motion. In illustration, I shall give the results of one trial on the same blood, with different vessels, extracted from my note-book. On the 12th December, in the Military Hospital at Corfu, blood from the arm of a patient, slightly indisposed, was received, first, into a wooden cup; second, into a circular pewter one, divided equally into two compartments; third, into a silver dish, placed on lint moistened with ether; fourth, into a small cupping-glass.

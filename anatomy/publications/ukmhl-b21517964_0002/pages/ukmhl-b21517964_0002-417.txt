DIFFERENT TEXTURES OF THE HUMAN BODY. 405 proved; and no less so to place much confidence in analogical reasoning, in opposition to or not sup- ported by, the simple evidence of the senses. Testes, and their Membranes, (7. 12.)—In the instance of No. 7, after eighteen days' maceration, one testis suspended in water deprived of its tunica albuginea, had become very soft and weak; its structure was well displayed, and its capillary tubes might be drawn out to some length. It appeared to be yielding pretty rapidly to decomposition,—but to my surprise it continued pretty nearly in the same state more than a month. On the sixtieth day little of it remained, and that was extremely soft. The tunica albuginea detached from one testis, under- went change rather more slowly than the other not detached. Both became corroded, gradually per- forated, covered with a mucus-like substance, and a fibrous vegetable growth. They underwent change more rapidly than the tunica vaginalis. On the eighty-ninth day, they were full of holes, and what remained was too weak to support its own weight; it was almost of a mucilaginous consistence, and had acquired a certain degree of transparency. At the same time the tunica vaginalis, and the tissue of scrotum, though somewhat wasted, still retained a certain degree of strength, and when stretched under water, had very much their original appearance,— the appearance of a tissue of very delicate fibres with some coarser ones intermixed, of a silky, or tendinous lustre. During maceration, I attempted

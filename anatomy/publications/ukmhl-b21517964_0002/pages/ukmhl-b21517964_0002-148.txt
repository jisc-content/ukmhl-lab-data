EXPERIMENTS ON THE BLOOD 130 * Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal, vol. xxxiv. for 1830. which, in a former inquiry,* I had arrived at a nega- tive conclusion, in opposition to the commonly re- ceived opinion, I have employed two methods of experimenting : one, of agitating blood, recently drawn and rapidly cooled, in common air and in oxygen, in a tube of the capacity of two cubic inches, divided into a hundred parts; the other, of agita- ting it in larger quantities with the same airs, in the very convenient apparatus employed by Dr. Chris- tison when engaged in a similar inquiry, consisting of a double tubulated bottle of the capacity of thirty- two cubic inches, provided with stop-cocks adapted by grinding, to one of which a moveable bent glass tube was fitted to connect it with a pneumatic trough, and to the other a perpendicular tube surmounted by a funnel. The blood subjected to experiment in every in- stance was prepared by the displacement of its fibrin. This was done by agitating it with small pieces of sheet-lead in a bottle filled to overflowing and closed with a cork, enveloped in moist bladder and covered over with the same, tied round the neck of the bottle, so as to exclude atmospheric air, whilst in the act of coagulating and of cooling, and to allow, when cooled, of the withdrawal of the cork. Prepared thus, and rapidly cooled, I have tried different specimens of blood, venous and arterial, of man, of the sheep, of the ox, and dog; and the results, when the blood has been taken from a

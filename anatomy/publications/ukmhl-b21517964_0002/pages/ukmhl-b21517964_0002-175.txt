IN CONNEXION WITH RESPIRATION. 163 ting of being extricated by the removal of atmo- spheric pressure. The result of this trial also has been negative; its power of absorbing oxygen has not appeared to be at all increased by exhaustion ; this at least was the result of one experiment care- fully conducted. 6.â€”Is any Oxygen contained in the Blood not capable of being extricated by the Air-pump ? Before I was acquainted with the researches of M. Magnus I had instituted some experiments to endeavour to determine whether any oxygen in a free state, or in a condition approximating to that state, exists in the blood, and especially in the arte- rial, admitting of being detected by means of sub- stances possessing a strong attraction for oxygen, or of being expelled by substances of greater solubility in blood than oxygen. Hydrogen, phosphuretted hydrogen, sulphuretted hydrogen, nitrous oxide and nitrous gas, it appeared advisable to try, as belong- ing to the first class of substances, and carbonic acid gas as belonging to the latter. The results with hydrogen, sulphuretted hydrogen, nitrous oxide and carbonic acid gas, were of a nega- tive kind. Neither using arterial blood, nor blood which had been agitated with oxygen, and which had absorbed or made to disappear a certain quantity of this gas, could I detect any indications of its presence either by combination or expulsion.

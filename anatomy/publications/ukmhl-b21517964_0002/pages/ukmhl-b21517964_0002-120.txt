MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS 108 Borax: fifty grains of this salt were mixed with three ounces and half of blood; it immediately assumed a brighter red; after twenty-four hours, the blood was liquid ; the red particles had completely subsided ; the supernatant fluid was of a bright yellow colour, like serum. Both the inferior and the supe- rior portion coagulated pretty firmly on dilution with water. After three days the diluted portion was slightly putrid; the other was free from any un- pleasant smell, and retained its power of coagu- lating ; and even after sixteen days it possessed this power. The experiment was made in Corfu, in November. Triple prussiate of potash : a drachm of this salt, in fine powder, was mixed with three ounces and half of blood ; coagulation was prevented ; the colour of the blood was a little brightened; the red particles rapidly subsided, and the supernatant fluid etiam absque nitri ope, pariter ex eodem sanguine coeunt. Color autem vividissime coccineus utique nitro debetur, quo sale non alius leetore purpure sanguinem ditat." Relative to the difference of opinion previously entertained, he observes, " Ceterum, si de lite ilia omnino definire oporteret, crederem nitrum sanguinem potius resolvere, siquidem leviorem reddit, neque mea experimenta penitus repugnant." He adds, " Alii sales medii utcunque similia faciunt. Sal marinus cum sanguine commistus floridum colorem facit, ceeterum coagulationem neque valde promovet, neque impedit, nisi motus accesserit, qui etiam solus coagulationem impedivissit." This may be considered as a tolerable summary of what was then known on the subject, coupled with a remark which precedes his observations on nitre. " Ea communis salium mediorum et lixiviosorum natura est, ut fluidum plernmque sanguinem reddant, aut liquidem conservent, colorem vero rubrum aut firment, aut omnino augeant."

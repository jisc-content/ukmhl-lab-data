101 ON THE BLOOD. it was rendered of a brighter and lighter red. This latter effect was most distinct in the instances of nitre, common salt, and borax; it was never perma- nent. On dilution with water, almost in every instance, the influence of the foreign substance ceased, and the blood coagulated; and, I believe, it would have done so in every instance, with the exception of vinegar, and aqua ammonise, and po- tassae, and apparently of magnesia, were the due proportion of water known which should have been added. Mr. Hewson, I believe, was the first who noticed this suspension of the power of coagulation and the restoration of it by the addition of water. His observations were confined to the neutral salts.* The notices which he gives of his experiments are very brief; he does not allude to the length of time the effect of suspension of coagulation may be con- tinued, nor does he appear to have been aware, that conjointly with this the tendency to putrefaction is arrested. From what I have witnessed, I believe * The following note appears to contain the results of Hewson's experiments on this subject,—"The salts which keep the blood fluid by itself, and yet allow it afterwards to jelly on being mixed with water, are sal glauberi verus (sulphate of soda), sal digestivus sylvii (chloride of potassium), sal communis, nitrum commune, nitrum culicum (nitrate of soda), sal diureticus (acetate of potassa), borax, the salt made of vinegar and the fossile alkali, and the salt made with vinegar and chalk." He adds, " the following salts, likewise, keep the blood fluid, but do not allow it to jelly when mixed with water, tartarus vitriolatus (sulphate of potash), sal epsomensis, sal ammo- niacus communis, sal ammoniacus nitrosus, sal rupillensis (tartrate of potassa and soda)."—Experimental Enquiry, foot-note, p. 13.

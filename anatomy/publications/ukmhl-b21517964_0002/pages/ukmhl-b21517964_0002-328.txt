31() EFFECTS OF BOILING ON THE 11. Aorta; its outer membrane contracted and was very much corrugated; its inner, [tried when detached,] very slightly, and its strength appeared to be very little diminished; the middle layer curled a very little, and uncurled when put into cold water, â€”and its strength was not apparently diminished. 12. A portion of vena cava became condensed and corrugated, curling, spirally, outward, from the greater contraction evidently of the outer fibro-cel- lular coat; the wrinkles appeared in the inner coat; there was no distinct loss of strength. A portion of the vena porta?, was very much corrugated; one portion of its inner coat was suddenly rendered gela- tinous ; another and contiguous portion, harsh and friable. 13. The thoracic duct contracted, and was very much shrivelled. In a few instances I endeavoured to determine, by measurement, the degree of contraction. A portion of dura mater, after the action of boiling water, was found contracted about one-half its length and width, but increased in thickness; a portion of tendo achillis gave nearly the same results; a small fasciculus of fibres, from gastrocnemius externus muscle, contracted less in length, only about one- third. To try to determine whether the contraction, in certain directions, was connected with a general condensation of substance, I ascertained the specific gravity of some of the textures before and after the

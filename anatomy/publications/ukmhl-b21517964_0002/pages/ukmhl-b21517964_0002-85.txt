It has been asserted that the blood of animals, hunted to death, and killed by the prussic or hydro- cyanic acid, continues in the liquid state; and even the high authority of Hunter may be adduced in support of the opinion, that, in animals run down in the chase, the blood is deprived of its power of coagulating. From all the information, however, which I have been able to collect, I am compelled to conclude, that the opinion in both cases has been hastily taken up, and is not correct. In relation to the hydrocyanic acid, in no instance have I witnessed the blood liquid, or deprived of its power of coagulating, in animals poisoned by it,— and I have paid attention to the state of the blood in many animals thus killed,—the cat, the dog, the rabbit,—and the appearance which it has exhibited, has been in no wise peculiar; its coagulation, as well as I could judge, was neither retarded nor accelerated. And this might be fully expected d priori, con- sidering that the hydrocyanic acid has no visible effect, even in large quantity, when mixed with the blood, out of the body.

354 ON THE AGENCY OF ATMOSPHERIC seems to be accompanied chiefly by the exhalation of water, and the formation of a very little carbonic acid gas. Mixture probably is another circum- stance which favours and accelerates the putrefac- tive process and the evolution of heat. The two circumstances already adduced may partly act in this manner, as well as by exposing a greater surface to the air. In the saccharine or vinous fermenta- tion, the effect of mixture is well marked. So long as the sweet vegetable juice is retained in the tubes or cells of the plant or fruit, it resists change; but, the instant the tubes are crushed, and the cells broken down, the fermentation under favourable circumstances commences. I suspect something similar to this happens with animal matter. It is known to every one that bruised meat putrefies very rapidly. An egg, carefully put by, exposed freely to the atmosphere, without any covering over its shell, will remain free from putridity for months; and in a dry atmosphere, will lose the greater pro- portion of the water which it contains, and on breaking it, the yolk and white will be found dry and contracted. But, if the yolk and white are intimately mixed by violent agitation, then, I believe, the mixture, even in the shell, will soon become putrid. Certain I am that when freely exposed to the air, out of the shell, the yolk being merely im- mersed in the white, they do not putrefy, though, if the two are mixed, in a short time they un- dergo a change; they become highly putrid, and

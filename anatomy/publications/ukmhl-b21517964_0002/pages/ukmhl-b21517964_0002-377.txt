365 AIR ON DEAD ANIMAL MATTER. them abounding in minute particles and containing some globules. But of how little value is such a remark,—and how little to be insisted on ! Many different semi-fluids might be mentioned bearing as close a resemblance. It is more to the purpose to compare the matter resulting from putrefaction with chyle. How great is the difference of the two! The chyle is alkaline, and yet contains no sensible quantity of ammonia; there is no reason to suppose that it contains any free carbonic acid ; it seems as if it were altogether a new formation. Chyle de- rived from the muscular fibre of the ox, in the tho- racic duct of the dog, or that of the ox derived from grass, consists of a milk-like serum, coagu- lable by acids, and of lymph spontaneously coagu- lable, resembling the fibrin of the blood in its manner of coagulating, and gradually contracting, and resem- bling it also in its manner of undergoing the putrid decomposition on exposure to the air by deliques- cing, as it were, or becoming semi-fluid. I will not say how incompatible all this appears to be with putrefaction, but more, how inexplicable in relation to our imperfect knowledge of the chemical changes taking place amongst the elements of matter desti- tute of life, or beyond the influence of the vital organs. If putrefaction is not admitted to be concerned in digestion, the second question asked above is answered as regards it,—" Whether in the stomach and intestines it may not be a source of animal

OTHER SECRETIONS, AND ON SOLID PARTS. 231 and these came principally from the ends of the divided vessels; the coronary vessels did not exhibit the slightest change, and not a particle of air could be discovered in them. These experiments were made at Corfu. Re- cently, I have instituted similar ones (using an air- pump of the best construction) on the carotid artery, containing blood secured by a ligature, and with the like result, as has already been described, when treating of the blood, in connexion with respiration ; and demonstrating, that even if the blood contain carbonic acid gas capable of being extricated by the air-pump, this extrication cannot take place, so long as the fluid is contained in the vessels, the pressure of their sides being sufficient, it would appear, to retain the elastic fluid, when present. Prochaska, in his ingenious treatise on the organ- ism of the human body and its vital processes, whilst he denies, as has been already mentioned, that air is to be found in the arteries after death, yet endeavours to shew, that during life, they and other parts of the body partially owe their distension to vapour which, as he supposes, they contain. He says : " si statum sanguinis in homine vivo et mortuo invicem com- paramus, ingens voluminis differentia in utroque adparet; nam qui in vivo homine omnia vasa a maximis ad minima usque repleverat, rubore vitali cutim universam perfuderat, post mortem ex minimis vasis evanescit, cui pallor cutis cadaverosus succedit, vense subcutanea? collabuntur, et arteriae a minimis

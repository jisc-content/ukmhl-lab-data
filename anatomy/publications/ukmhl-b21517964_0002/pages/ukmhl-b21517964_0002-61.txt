49 ON THE BLOOD. And, I added, as a general inference from the obser- vations also in conformity with Mr. Hewson's views, " May it not be inferred generally, that the burly coat is principally owing, not to the slow coagulation of the blood on which it appears, but to its increased tenuity, or, in other words, to the diminished viscidity of coagulable lymph, the effect of morbid vas- cular action, connected with the inflammatory dia- thesis ?" Mr. Hay, in his " Observations on the Blood," had objected to Mr. Hewson, that the coagulable lymph is not itself attenuated in inflammatory dis- eases, and that when it appears to be so, it is from dilution with serum. Were this opinion correct, I remarked in the same paper, such blood should be of a specific gravity unusually low, which it is not, as I had satisfied myself by numerous experiments, made both at home and in Ceylon, and of which experimental proof has already been afforded. 9.â€”Historical Notices respecting the Blood, parti- cularly its Coagulation. A carefully drawn-up history of the speculations which have been formed, and of the observations which have been made by ingenious men, relative to the coagulation of the blood, and the formation of the buffy coat, would be curious and interesting in many respects; and, it may be noticed as a desi- deratum in medical literature.

ON THE BLOOD. 115 dead ? And may not the same be said of the blood which is derived from it ? In many of their pro- perties, chyme and chyle have a certain resemblance, and chyle and blood a close resemblance. They (chyle and blood) both contain suspended in them solid particles of a definite form; both contain a spontaneously coagulable fluid, and, another fluid ingredient coagulable by heat: they differ chiefly as regards the solid particles,—in the one, spherical and colourless, or nearly so; in the other, coloured, and in the instance of the mammalia, of a disc-like form. Descending in the scale of organization, the reasoning just employed appears even more con- clusive. In certain animals, there appears to be but little difference between the chyme or alimen- tary fluid and the blood,—the former passing into the blood-vessels direct. And in certain other animals, there appears to be no difference,—their chyme or alimentary fluid, being what is commonly called their vital fluid, and distributed by ramifi- cations of the alimentary canal, they having no regular vascular system. In further prosecution of the latter train of argu- ment, it might be maintained, that many of the reasons which are commonly assigned in favour of the blood not being dead, are applicable only to arterial blood; and so far they may be retorted to prove, that if one kind of blood is alive, the other is dead; and, consequently, that the circulation of the blood may be viewed as a perpetual miracle, in i 2

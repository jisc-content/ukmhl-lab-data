IN CONNEXION WITH RESPIRATION. 141 introduced, and they were seen in the same light side by side. Referring to Dr. Crawford's Treatise on Animal Heat, I find in confirmation, that he had arrived at the same conclusion, more than fifty years ago, from his own experiments on the influence of heat and cold on the colour of the blood, and the quantity of oxygen consumed in respiration. In the most decisive experiments detailed by him, he states, that " the venous blood (of a dog that had been immersed in warm water for half an hour) assumed very nearly the hue of the arterial, and resembled it so much in appearance that it was diffi- cult to distinguish between them."* And, in another experiment, the reverse of this, in which a dog was immersed in cold water at 45°, for about a quarter of an hour, he says, that the blood now taken from the jugular vein appeared to him, as well as to several other gentlemen, who assisted, " to be the darkest venous blood we had ever seen."f In my communication to the Royal Society, in corrobo- * Experiments and observations on Animal Heat, p. 309. Second edition. f Perhaps the influence of atmospheric temperature may in some measure help to reconcile the apparently discordant results of nu- merous observations on the colour of arterial and venous blood; thus on one side Haller says " Seepe comparavi arteriaj pulmonalis cavae- que venee sanguinem, cum arterioso sanguine vense de pulmone reducis, nunquam in multis experimentis, aliquam in colore utrius- que sanguinis diversitatem vidi, neque Harveius vidit, neque Guiliel- mus Cheselden, neque cl. Knight, neque cl. noster auditor Evertsen, neque ipse contrarise opinionis auctor Hambergerus."—Element. Physiol, ii. p. 11.

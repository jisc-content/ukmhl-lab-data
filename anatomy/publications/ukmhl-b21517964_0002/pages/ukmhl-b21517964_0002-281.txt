269 IX. ON THE EFFECTS OF DESICCATION, AND THE PRO- PORTION OF WATER CONTAINED IN THE DIFFER- ENT TEXTURES OF THE HUMAN BODY. This subject, like that of the specific gravity of the different textures, may be considered also as elemen- tary and fundamental; for unless it is known with tolerable accuracy what is the quantity of dry solid matter, each part is capable of affording, or may be said to contain, other statical results will of necessity be vague and of little value. It was in Malta, in the summer of 1828, that I commenced the inquiry, desirous of conducting it on a more extended plan than I believe had been pre- viously attempted, by any one individual; so that, one method being employed, and the circumstances being similar, the results might be compared with confidence, and discrepancies avoided. The method of desiccation which I employed was simply that of the vapour-bath. The parts were either placed on paper when not likely to adhere, in a Wedgewood evaporating dish, over steam ; or

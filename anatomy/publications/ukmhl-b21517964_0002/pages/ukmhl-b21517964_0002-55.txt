The blood of the patient No. 8, in the last Table, which was of the low specific gravity 1038, coagulated rapidly: on the contrary, I have known blood which differed very little from healthy blood, and which did not exhibit a buffy coat, remain liquid eight minutes after having been drawn, and not till the tenth minute was its incipient coagulation distinct. When the serum and coagulable lymph are not viscid, and in consequence not capable of supporting the red particles, these particles fall down rapidly; if the fluidity of the blood is great, two minutes are sufficient for their subsidence an eighth or even a quarter of an inch, as I have many times witnessed, and instances of which I shall hereafter bring for- ward. No doubt, very buffy blood is very slow in coagulating, for the red particles cannot sink far in a very short time ; and it is well known that healthy blood, which is of comparatively high specific gravity, coagulates rapidly. It is my wish to be understood to maintain merely, that the qualities in question,— high specific gravity and rapidity of coagulation; low specific gravity and slowness of coagulation,—are not necessarily connected, but rather accidentally, and consequently, that neither can be considered as * Op. c-it. p. 35.

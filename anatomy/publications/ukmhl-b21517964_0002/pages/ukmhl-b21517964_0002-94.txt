MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS 82 * Op. cit. p. 125. Hewson, from his experiments and observations, inferred that " the properties of the blood depend on the state of the blood-vessels ; or that they have a plastic power over it, so as to be able to change its properties in a very short time;" that what in- creases or strengthens vascular action, or the heart's action, tends to retard coagulation, and that which has a contrary agency, promotes and accelerates it .* He arrived at this, which he calls his " most re- markable conclusion," from witnessing the sudden change in the coagulating power of the blood, during the same blood-letting, as exemplified in different portions, received separately; confirmed by what he witnessed in instances of animals blooded to death. In these last-mentioned instances, it has been shewn, that the specific gravity of the blood which flows from the slaughtered animal, when nearly ex- hausted, is less than of that which flows when the vessels are first divided. The circumstance necessarily gives rise to reflec- tion. As it seems to shew that the composition of the blood is altered at least as regards the relative pro- portions of its constituent parts, as obtained in the process of draining the vital fluid, it is matter for con- sideration, whether something similar may not take place in the other instances referred to by Hewson; and whether the changes in the circulating mass which he attributed to the vessels, acting on the blood,

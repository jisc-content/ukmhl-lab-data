OTHER SECRETIONS, AND ON SOLID PARTS. 225 in the preceding section—and the results were equally negative. It has been asserted by a distinguished inquirer, that a small quantity of air is not an uncommon occurrence in the synovial capsules: the words of M. Laennec are—" Ton sait qu'il se trouve souvent, dans les capsules synoviales, une petite quantite d'un fluide aeriforme." * If so, it might be expected, that air might even more frequently be detected in the synovia itself, on the removal of atmospheric pressure; and that the results I have given above are to be viewed as exceptions. But, with a feeling of the highest respect for the individual quoted, I believe that in this instance, he has received as matter of fact what is not really so, trusting unduly to loose opinion formed on careless observation. For many years, my attention has been specially directed to the subject of air in the cavities of the body, and I can, without hesitation, say, that in no instance, out of several hundred, in which I have examined the joints after death, could I detect in them the presence of any elastic fluid. Amongst my notes, bearing the date of Malta, June, 1828, I find three cases, in which careful search was made for air in the capsules of the joints and the sheaths of tendons, by an examination of the parts under water,—the bodies having been im- mersed in a bath for the purpose; one, six hours after death, another eleven, and a third twelve.

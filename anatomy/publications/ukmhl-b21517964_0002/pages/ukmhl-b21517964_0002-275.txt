DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE HUMAN BODY. 263 first, relative to the degree of accuracy which may be claimed for them; and secondly in relation to practical use and application. As regards accuracy, the results generally can with propriety be considered as approximations only to the truth. The principal sources of error were twoâ€”moisture and air, foreign to the composition of the part, both of which it is difficult to remove with that precision which is necessary to insure perfect correctness. The effect of adhering fluid, however, in slight excess or deficiency may, I believe, be held to be of little account in comparison with the other cause, the air, the difference of weight of which, compared with that of solids and liquids, is so enor- mously great. This source of error exists in different instances in very different degrees, probably very nearly in direct proportion to the vascularity of the part tried, and the size of its vessels, and also to its dryness. This may be deduced from the experi- ments already related on the action of the air-pump on animal textures. Strictly, in experiments on the specific gravities of bodies, all adhering air, whether superficially attached or contained in the internal structure, should be removed by exhaustion. Whilst I express regret that circumstances did not permit my using this precaution as I could have wished, I shall give a small number of examples in which I have since employed it, from which some judgment may be formed of the amount of error attributable to the presence of air.

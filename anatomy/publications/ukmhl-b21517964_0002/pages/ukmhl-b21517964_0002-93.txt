Perhaps it may safely be laid down as a general rule, that the form and quality of vessel best adapted for preventing sudden cooling, and therefore an in- crease of the viscidity of the blood or coagulable lymph, favour most the rapid subsidence of the red particles, and consequently the formation of the bufFy coat. This is in accordance with Dr. Benjamin Babington's experience with thin pear-shaped glass vessels, such as he used for the purpose of ascertaining the specific gravity of the blood ;* and also with mine, on thin globular glass vessels. Very often I have found a bufTy coat in these globes, when none appeared on the blood collected in the usual way. 7.â€” On the Influence of the Blood-vessels or of Vital Action on the Coagulation of the Blood.

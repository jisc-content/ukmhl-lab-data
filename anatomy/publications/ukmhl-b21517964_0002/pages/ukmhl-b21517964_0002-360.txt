348 ON THE AGENCY OF ATMOSPHERIC placed for observation on the 3d August. On the 5th, its temperature was the same as that of the water; its odour was offensive, but not ammoniacal; a good deal of reddish fluid had exuded, and a little air was in the act of disengagement. On the 4th, in some places it was 1° higher, and in others 2°. Where highest, some froth was produced, and many small larvae were feeding. The temperature gra- dually increased till the 10th, when it was raised 12°; its surface was covered with larvae feeding voraciously in froth, and nearly full grown, and the odour was powerfully ammoniacal. From this time, it gradually decreased, till on the 13th, it did not exceed that of the water; most of the larvae were dead ; the odour was very ammoniacal; the surface was free from froth, and of a dark brown colour, in some places almost black and of a soft poultaceous consistence. Beneath the surface the chancre de- creased with the depth ; and in the lower part, the liver was comparatively little altered; its parenchyma- tous substance was softened, of a grey hue, and easily removed by gentle pressure, aided by a stream of water; whilst the vascular structure, (at least all but the very minute branches) retained sufficient strength to resist the pressure and water, and ac- cordingly became well displayed by the operation. Intestines.—These were from body No. 4, and were placed for observation, after having been washed out, on the 3d of July. Their temperature on the 4th was the same as that of the water, though the odour

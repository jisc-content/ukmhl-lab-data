134 MORPHOLOGY OF THE BONES OF THE LIMBS. simultaneously with the cartilages of the other carpal hones; it then gradually dwindles from the palmar to the dorsal surface, and by the fourth month has entirely disappeared. (E. Rosenberg, Morphol. Jahrb. i. 83 ; Kolliker, Entwick- lungsgeschichte, 2nd Ed., p. 497.) The determination of the homology of the navicular bone of the tarsus is not yet fully made out, but it seems most probable that this bone corresponds not to any single or entire bone of the carpus, but rather to the os centrale, together with a detached portion of the scaphoid. In some animals there is a tenth separate bone of the carpus, which seems most nearly to correspond to the tuberosity of the scaphoid : this constitutes the typical radial sesamoid of Gegenbaur, and the navicular bone of the tarsus may perhaps correspond to this along with the os centrale. It is interesting to remark that this bone is sometimes found separate in the human hand. (See W. Gruber, Struthers, Turner, and others, in Joum. of Anat., and Mivart “ On the Appen- dicular Skeleton of the Primates” in Philos. Trans. 1807.) The os calcis is generally believed to correspond most nearly with the pyramidal of the carpus, and by some it has been held to include the pisiform,—a view not participated in by Gegenbaur, but of the truth of which any one will be convinced by the inspection of the hand and foot of the bear. It is deserving of remark that in the young of that animal the much enlarged pisiform possesses an epi- physis of its own, exactly similar to the one known as existing on the tuberosity of the calcaneum,—a fact observable also in other animals, and which of itself refutes the view taken by some that the pisiform corresponds to the epiphysis of the calcaneal tuberosity. (Allen Thomson.) The following tables present a synoptical view of the corresponding or homo- logous bones or other parts in the thoracic and pelvic limbs.

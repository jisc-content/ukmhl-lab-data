BRACHIAL VEINS. 511 DEEP VEINS OF THE UPPER LIMB. The brachial artery and its various branches in the arm, forearm and hand, are each accompanied by two veins, named vence comites. These companion veins lie one on each side of the corresponding- artery, and are connected with each other at intervals by short cross branches, which in some places closely surround the artery. Their distribution so nearly corresponds with that of the arteries, that they need not be more particularly described. The brachial veins, or yen® comites of the brachial artery, terminate near the lower margin of the subscapularis muscle by joining the axillary Fig. 297. The blood-vessels of the axilla and arm from the inner side (R. Quain). J The detailed description of this figure will be found at p. 409. The following numbers indicate the principal veins :—2, axillary vein; 3, 3, basilic vein ; 3', median basilic ; 4, 4', cephalic vein ; 6, alar thoracic and subscapular ; 7, one of the brachial veins. vein ; not unfrequently, however, the inner one unites with the basilic vein soon after that vessel passes beneath the fascia. Between the several veins of the upper limb numerous communica- tions exist in their whole course. Thus, those which lie beneath the integument are freely connected to each other by cross branches in the hand and forearm. Not only are the veins in each pair of venae comites united by short transverse vessels crossing the artery which they accom- pany, but also those accompanying different arteries have frequent con- nections with each other. Lastly, the subcutaneous and the deep veins communicate freely, especially in the neighbourhood of the joints. This general anastomosis ensures the continuance of the circulation during muscular action in the frequent and varied motions of the limb. The axillary vein is of large size and collects all the blood returning from the upper limb. It is formed by the continuation upwards of the

The iliacus lies over the ilium, the anterior head of the rectus femoris, and the hip-joint, to the capsule of which a few of its fibres are some- Fig. 179.

The psoas rests against the vertebrae, the quadratus lumborum, and the brim of the pelvis, overlapping also the inner border of the iliacus. The common tendon passes downwards in a deep groove between the anterior inferior 1 spine and the ilio-pectineal eminence, and lower down, between the tendon and the capsule of the hip, is a large synovial bursa which sometimes communicates with the cavity of the joint.

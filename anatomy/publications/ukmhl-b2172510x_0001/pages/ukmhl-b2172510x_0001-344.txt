MUSCLES OF TEE ABDOMEN. 324 it becomes inseparably united with the aponeurosis beneath, and forms a part of the sheath of the rectus muscle in the whole extent of the space from the ensiform process to the symphysis pubis. The upper part of the aponeurosis is connected with the pectoralis major, giving origin to the lowest fibres of that muscle. The lowest fibres of the aponeurosis are closely aggregated together, and extend across from the anterior superior spine of the ilium to the spine of the pubis, in the form of a thickened band, which is called Poupartfs ligament. This ligament is curved with its convexity downwards owing to the attachment of the iliac portion of the fascia lata to its lower border, but the degree of curvature and the tension of the band vary with the position of the limb, being increased Fig. 214.

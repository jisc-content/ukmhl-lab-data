544 CRANIAL NERVES. nerve is attached to the surface of the brain is termed the superficial origin of the nerve. From this apparent origin, however, the nerve- roots can be traced for a variable depth within the substance of the encephalon to certain collections of nerve-cells or nuclei, the connection with which constitutes the deep origin of the nerve. The superficial origins of these nerves are quite obvious : the filaments of the first pair spring from the olfactory lobes of the cerebral hemispheres ; the second pair arise from the dorsal part of the mesencephalon; the third are attached to the crura cerebri or ventral part of the mesencephalon ; the fourth to the valve of Vieussens ; the fifth to the pons ; and the re- mainder to the medulla oblongata, with the exception of the greater part of the eleventh pair, which arise from the cervical portion of the spinal cord. The course of the fibres within the cerebro-spinal centre, and their connection with the nerve-nuclei are described in the Second Fig. 311. FE 311 â€”Lateral view of the connection of the cranial nerves with the brain. (A. T.) The full description of this figure will be found atp. 2S5, Vol. II. The following references apply to the roots of the nerves: I, right olfactory tract, cut near its middle ; II, the optic nerves immediately in front of the commissure ; the right optic tract is seen passing hack to the thalamus (Th), corpora geniculata (;', e), and corporaquadrigemina (<?)'; Ill, oculomotor nerve ; IV, trochlear nerve rising at v, from the valve of Vieussens ; V, trifacial nerve ; VI, abducent ocular ; VII, VIII, facial and auditory nerves ; between them the pars inter- media ; IX, glosso-pharyngeal; X, pneumo-gastric; XI, spinal accessory; XII, hypoglossal; G I, the separate anterior and posterior roots of the suboccipital or first cervical neiwe.

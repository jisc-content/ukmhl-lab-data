BRANCHES OF UPPER CERVICAL GANGLION. 655 cases, however, this nerve ends, either wholly or in part, in the deep cardiac plexus, and it then descends behind the arch of the aorta. 4. Branches to blood-vessels.—The nerves which ramify on the arteries (nervi molles) spring from the front of the ganglion, and twine round the trunk of the external carotid artery. They arc also prolonged on the branches of the artery, and form slender plexuses upon them. From the plexus on the facial artery is derived the filament which forms the sympathetic root of the submaxillary ganglion ; and from that on Fig. 366. Fig. 366.—Connections of the cervical and upper dorsal sympathetic ganglia AND NERVES ON THE LEFT SIDE. The full description of this figure will be found at p. 580. The following numbers refer to the sympathetic ganglia and nerves, and those immediately connected with them : 5, pharyngeal plexus ; 12, 13, posterior pulmonary plexus ; and to the reader’s left, above the pulmonary artery, the superficial cardiac plexus ; 21, superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic ; 25, middle cervical ganglion ; 26, conjoined inferior cervical and first dorsal ganglia ; 27, 28, 29, 30, second, third, fourth, and fifth dorsal ganglia.

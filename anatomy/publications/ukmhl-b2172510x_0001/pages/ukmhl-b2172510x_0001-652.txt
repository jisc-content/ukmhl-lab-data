The lower band is, however, in some cases joined also by a fasciculus from the second sacral nerve. To the place of union the nerves proceed in different directions, that of the upper ones being obliquely downwards, while that of the lower is nearly horizontal; and, as a consequence of this difference, they diminish in length from the first to the last. The sacral plexus rests on the anterior surface of the pyriformis muscle, opposite the side of the sacrum, and escaping through the great sacro- sciatic foramen, ends at the lower border of the pyriformis in the great sciatic and pudic nerves.

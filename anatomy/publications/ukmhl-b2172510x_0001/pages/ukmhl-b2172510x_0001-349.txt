TRAXSYERSALIS ABDOMINIS MUSCLE. 329 diaphragm (fig. 211, p. 31G) ; from the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebras by a strong posterior aponeurosis ; from the inner margin of the crest of the ilium in the anterior two-thirds of its extent; and from the outer third of Poupart’s ligament. The greater part of the fibres have a horizontal direction, and extend forwards to a broad aponeurosis in front ; the lowest fibres curve downwards like those of the internal oblique, with which they are frequently closely united, and are inserted into the front Fig. 217.—Lateral view OF THE TRUNK, SHOW- ING THE SERRATUS MAG- NUS AND TRANSVERSALIS ABDOMINIS MUSCLES. (A.

Fig. 217. of the pubis and into the ilio-pectineal line, through the medium of the conjoined ten- don already described as common to this muscle and the inter- nal oblique. The anterior aponeurosis of the Lransversalis muscle commences in the greater part of its extent at the distance of about an inch from the outer border of the rectus muscle ; but at its upper extremity it is much narrower, and there the muscular fibres of opposite sides approach

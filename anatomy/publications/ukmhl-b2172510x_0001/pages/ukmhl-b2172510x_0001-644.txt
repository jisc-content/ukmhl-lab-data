LUMBAR NERVES. 624 Varieties.-—The genital branch is sometimes larger than usual, and replaces in part or completely the terminal ramifications of the ilio-inguinal nerve. The crural branch may be small or absent, the deficiency being supplied by the ex- ternal or middle cutaneous nerves of the thigh. External cutaneous nerve.—This nerve, arising from the loop formed between the second and third lumbar nerves, emerges from the outer border of the psoas muscle, and crosses the iliacus below the ilio- inguinal nerve, where it is placed beneath the iliac fascia. It passes Fig. 350.

DESCENDING THORACIC AORTA. 432 costal groove of the upper rib, it finally anastomoses with one of the anterior intercostal branches derived from the internal mammary artery. Fig. 26!. Fig. 2G1.—The thoracic AND GREATER PART OP THE ABDOMINAL AORTA, &C. i For the general descrip tion of this figure, see p. 354. The following numbers indicate the branches of the aorta ; 1, placed between the origins of the right and left coronary arteries; 2, innominate; 3, left carotid; 4, left subclavian ; 5, bron- chial ; 6, 6, oesophageal; 7, 7, intercostal arteries (sixth and seventh) ; 8, inferior phrenic ; 9, coeliac axis; 10, below the superior mesen- teric and opposite the origin of the renal arteries; 11, 11, two of the lumbar ar- teries. The first of the aortic intercostal arte- ries has an anastomosis with the superior inter- costal artery from the subclavian, and not unfrequently sends up- wards a considerable branch, which supplies the second space wholly or in great part. The last two are prolonged into the abdominal wall, where they com- municate with the epi- gastric artery, and with the lumbar branches of the abdominal aorta. Each intercostal ar- tery is accompanied, as it runs outwards be- tween the ribs, by a corresponding vein, and by an intercostal nerve; the vein being usually above, and the nerve below it. Branches.— (a) The posterior or dorsal branch of each intercostal artery passes backwards to the inner side of the superior costo-transverse ligament, along with the posterior branch of

OSSIFICATION OF THE BONES OF THE HAND. 103 however, as was known to Albinus, and has been more fully shewn by Allen Thomson (Jour, of Anat. 1869), there is also a distal epiphysis visible in the first metacarpal bone at the age of seven or eight years, and there are even traces of a proximal epiphysis in the second metacarpal. In the seal and some other Fig. 84. c Fig. 84.â€”Ossification of thf. hones of the hand (R. Quain). A, the condition at birth. The carpus is entirely cartilaginous. Each of the meta- carpal bones and digital phalanges has its shaft ossified. B, at the end of the first year ; the os magnum and unciform have begun to ossify. C, about the third year. Centres of ossification are seen in the pyramidal and in the proximal epiphysis of the first and the distal epiphyses of the other four metacarpal bones, and in the proximal epiphyses of the first row of phalanges. D, at the fifth year. Centres have been formed in the trapezium and later in the semilunar bone, and in the epiphyses of the middle and distal phalanges : (the figure does not show them distinctly in the middle phalanges). E, at about the ninth year. Centres have been formed in the scaphoid and trapezoid bones, and the more developed epiphyses of the metacarpal bones and phalanges are shown in the first and second digits separately. 1, os magnum; 2, unciform ; 3, pyramidal; 4, semilunar; 5, trapezium; 6, scaphoid; 7, trapezoid ; 8, metacarpal bones, the principal pieces ; 8*, four metacarpal epiphyses ; 8', that of the thumb ; 9, first phalanges ; 9*, their epiphyses ; 9', that of the thumb ; 10, second phalanges; 10', epiphysis of terminal phalanx of thumb ; 11, terminal pha- langes of the fingers ; 11*, then- epiphyses.

T.) i a, acromion ; b, base of the sca- pula ; c, tendon of the trapezius muscle over the triangular surface of the spine of the scapula; d, ole- cranon ; e, external condyle; 1, trapezius; 2, acromial part of deltoid; 2', the part of the same muscle rising from the spine of the scapula; 3, rhomboideus major ; 4, infraspinatus ; 5, teres minor ; 6, teres major ; 7, latissimus dorsi ; +, space between the trapezius, rhomboid and latissimus muscles; 8, long head of triceps; 8', its outer head ; 8", its tendon ; 9, anconeus ; 10, part of the brachialis anticus ; 11, supinator longus ; 12, extensor carpi radialis longior. The explanation of the remaining refer- ences will be found in the description of fig. 168. the neck and the spaces occu- pied by the serratus magnus, but including the groove along the axillary border of the bone. The greater number of its fibres unite into a broad tendon which is inserted into the im- pression on the small tubero- sity of the humerus ; some of the lower fibres, however, are directly inserted into the bone for a short distance farther down. Three or four tendi- nous septa, attached to the ridges of the subscapular fossa, pass outwards in the origin of the muscle ; and others are prolonged inwards from the tendon of insertion. Relations.—The tendon of the subscapularis is incorporated with the capsule of the shoulder-joint, and between its upper border and posterior surface, and the coracoid process and neck of the scapula is a bursa usually communicating with that joint. There is some- times another bursa intervening between the anterior surface of the muscle and the upper ends of the biceps and coraco-brachialis muscles. Anteriorly the muscle is in contact at its origin with the

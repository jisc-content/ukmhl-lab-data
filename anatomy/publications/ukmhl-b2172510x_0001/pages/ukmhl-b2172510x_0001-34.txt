VERTEBRAL COLUMN. 14 Lumbar Vertebrae.—These are five in number, the largest of the moveable vertebra, and are distinguished by the absence of costal articular surfaces. Fig. 9. Fig. 9.—Third lumbar vertebra. (A.T.) £ A, from above ; B, from the right side ; 1, body; 2, pedicle and intervertebral notch ; 3, lamina ; 4, spinal foramen ; 5, spinous process ; 6, transverse process ; 7, 7', superior and inferior articular pro- cesses ; e, mammillary tubercle, appa- rently on the superior articular process ; /, accessory tubercle, between the articular and transverse processes. The Jjodij has a greater diameter transversely than from before backwards, and viewed from above or below its surface presents a reniform outline; the depth is about equal in front and behind. The laminm are shorter, deeper, and thicker than those of the dorsal vertebrae. The superior notches are shallow, the inferior deep. The spinous process proiects horizontally backwards. It has con- siderable breadth front above Fig. 10. downwards, and is thickened and rough along its posterior edge. Fig. 10. — Lower two dorsal and UPPER TWO LUMBAR VERTEBRAE. (A. T.) i Viewed from behind, chiefly to show the relations of the transverse processes and adjacent tubercles. 1, body of the eleventh dorsal vertebra; 5, spinous process of the second lumbar; 6, exter- nal or costal tubercle of the transverse process ; 7, 7', superior and inferior articular processes ; e, superior or mam- millary, and /, inferior or accessory tubercle; c, c, eleventh and twelfth ribs. The trans verse processes, slender and somewhat spatula-shaped, project directly outwards ; they are shortest in the first, longest in the third vertebra. Their ex- tremities lie in series with the external tubercles of the lower dorsal transverse processes, and with the ribs. Behind each at its base is a small process pointing downwards, which corresponds to the inferior

THE WKI5T-JQINT AND HAND. 169 The internal lateral ligament is a rounded cord passing directly downwards from the styloid process of the ulna, to the pyramidal bone, and by its anterior fibres to the pisiform bone. The external lateral ligament extends from the styloid process of the radius to a depression on the scaphoid bone between the radial articular surface and the tubercle. Fig. 135.

T.) 1 The anterior radio-carpal ligament has been removed : 1, anterior ligament of the lower radio-ulnar articulation ; 2, external, and 3, internal lateral ligament of the wrist-joint; 4, scaphoid hone ; 5, semilunar; 6, pyramidal; 7, pisiform, with the tendon of flexor carpi ulnaris attached ; 4 to 5, and 5 to 6, palmar ligaments of the first row ; 8, external lateral ligament between the first and second row of carpal bones; 9, trapezium (the trapezoid is not numbered) ; 10, os magnum ; 11, hooked process of the unciform bone ; 9 to 10, 10 to 11, and others, palmar ligaments of the second row ; 4 to 10, and 6 to 10, some of the palmar ligaments uniting the two rows, converging on the os magnum ; 7 to 11, ligament from the pisiform bone to the unciform process ; 7 to 16, ligament from the pisiform to the fifth metacarpal bone ; 12, external ligament of the first caipo- metacarpal articulation ; 13, 14, 15, 16, the proximal ends of the second to the fifth metacarpal bones, on which the palmar transverse, and on three of them, a set of piso- metaearpal ligaments are shown. The anterior ligament, broad and membranous, consists partly of fibres which have a nearly transverse direction, partly of others which diverge as they descend from the anterior border of the radius to the scaphoid, semilunar, and pyramidal bones ; some of them are continued

The longitudinal fibres on the posterior aspect of the joint are almost absent, being represented only by a few scattered Fig. 142.

In other parts of the capsule the longitudinal fibres form thick bands, certain of which from their greater size and strength are distinguished as accessory ligaments. The most important of these is formed on the anterior and superior aspects of the

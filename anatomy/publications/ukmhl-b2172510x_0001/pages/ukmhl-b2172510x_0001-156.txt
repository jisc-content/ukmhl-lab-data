ERECT ATTITUDE OF THE SKELETON. 13G which meet at the hip-joints, and is so inclined that a vertical line descending from the centre of gravity of the body is in a plane slightly behind the centres of motion of the hip-joints. The breadth of the pelvis enables the balance to be more easily maintained in lateral movements of the body by compensating in- clinations of different parts to opposite sides of the basis of support, and the long neck of the femur gives an advantageous insertion to the muscles by which the balance of the body is principally preserved. The hip-bone is mainly distinguished from the same bone in animals by the breadth of its iliac portion, which gives support to the abdominal viscera, and attachment to the greatly developed iliac and gluteal muscles. The lower limbs are remarkable for their length and strength. The femur is greatly elongated, its length considerably exceeding that of the tibia,â€”a condi- tion which is requisite not only to give a sufficient extent of stride, but also to enable the body to be balanced in different degrees and varieties of stooping. The foot of man alone among animals has an arched instep, and it likewise presents a great breadth of sole. The great toe is distinguished by its full development, and especially from that of the quadrumana, by its want of opposa- bility, being constructed, not for grasping, but for supporting the weight of the body, and giving spring to the step. While stability and strength are thus provided in the lower limbs, mobility and lightness are secured in the upper. This is apparent on comparison of the .shoulder, elbow, and wrist, with the hip, knee, and ankle. In the hand, also, the freely moveable phalanges are as long as the caipal and metacarpal bones taken together, while in the foot they are not a third of the length of the tarsal and metatarsal bones,

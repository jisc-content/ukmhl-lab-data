704 THE PERINEUM OF THE MALE. the fascia propria of the hernia (Cooper), ft sometimes happens that the hernia is protruded through an openiug in the sheath, which there- fore in that event does not contribute to form the fascia propria. Lastly, the hernia is covered by the cribriform fascia stretching across the saphenous opening, the superficial fascia and the skin.

THE PERINEUM OF THE MALE. The perineum is the region which is included within the outlet of the pelvis, and which is traversed by the lower end of the rectum and by the urethra. It extends, therefore, from the apex of the subpubic arch in front to the tip of the coccyx behind, and from the ischial tuberosity of one side to that of the other. It is bounded on each side, at the fore part, by the conjoined rami of the pubis and ischium, and at the back part, by the great sacro-sciatic ligament together with a portion of the lower border of the gluteus maximus muscle. Its form is rather heart- shaped in consequence of the projection of the coccyx posteriorly ; it measures about three and a half inches from side to side, and about four inches over the curved surface (three and a quarter inches in a straight line) from before back in the middle line. The perineal space is sepa- rated from the pelvic cavity above by the recto-vesical fascia and the levatores ani muscles; its depth is considerable (from two to three inches) at the posterior and outer part, much less (not exceeding an inch) at the fore part. The perineal space is conveniently divided into two parts by a line drawn across from one ischial tuberosity to the other, and passing imme- diately in front of the anus. The anterior division is termed the

BOXES OF THE LOWER LIMB. 108 margin of the united rami of the ischium and pubis can be followed to the ischial tuberosity, dividing the perineum from the thigh. The remainder of the bone is thickly covered by muscles. THE PELVIS. The hip-bones with the sacrum and coccyx form the pelvis. This part of the skeleton may be considered as divided into two parts by a plane passing through the sacral promontory, the ilio-pectineal lines, and the upper border of the symphysis pubis. The circle thus com- pleted constitutes the brim or inlet of the lower or true pelvis ; the space Fig. 87. Fig. 87. Similarly placed with that shown in the preceding figure, and illustrating by comparison with it, the principal differ- ences between the male and female pel- vis. The numbers indicate the same parts as in the pre- ceding figure. above it, between the iliac fossae, belongs really to the abdomen, but has been called the upper or false pelvis. The inferior circumference, or outlet of the pelvis, presents three large bony emi- nences, the coccyx and the tuberosities of the ischia. Between the tube- rosities of the ischia in front is the subpubic arch, which bounds an angular space extending forwards to the symphysis, and is formed by the inferior rami of the pubes and the rami of the ischia. The interval between the sacrum and coccyx and the ischium on each side is bridged over in the recent state by the sacro-sciatic ligaments, which therefore assist in bounding the outlet of the pelvis.

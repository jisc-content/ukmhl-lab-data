31G MUSCLES OF TIIE THORAX. bones, from the sixth to the second inclusive, on the lower border and inner surface of each. At the lower margin the fibres are in the same plane with those of the transversalis abdominis, of which the triangularis sterni muscle is a continuation upwards. Relations.—The internal mammary vessels pass between its anterior surface and the costal cartilages : the pleura is in contact with its deep surface. Varieties.—The triangularis sterni is subject to much variation as to its extent and points of attachment in different bodies, and even on the opposite sides of the same body. Absence on one or both sides has been recorded. Fig. 211. Fig. 211.—Deep muscles or the anterior wall or the thorax, seen from behind (modified from Luschka). (A. T.) a, back of the manubrium ; b, b, clavicles ; I to XI, anterior parts of eleven ribs and costal cartilages ; 1, 1', sterno-tliyroid muscles, that of the left side being cut short to show more fully the next muscle ; 2, 2', sterno-hyoids ; 3, 3, triangularis sterni; 4, 4, upper part of transversalis abdominis, the right and left muscles meeting at 4', 4', the back of the linea alba ; 5, attachments of the diaphragm to the lower ribs (the twelfth not represented in the figure), interdigitating with those of the transversalis ; 5', the two slips to the ensiform process; 6, 6, (j, internal intercostal muscles extending to the sternum, shown in all the spaces on the right side, but only in the highest two of the left side ; at 7, 7, 7, in the lower spaces of the left side, the external intercostal muscles are seen, the internal having been removed.

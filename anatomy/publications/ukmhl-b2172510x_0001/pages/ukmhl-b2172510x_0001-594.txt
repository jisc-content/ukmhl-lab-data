CRANIAL NERVES. 574 muscle join with filaments of the buccal branch of the inferior maxillary nerve. The supramaxillary branch, sometimes double, runs forwards beneath the depressor anguli oris, and, after communicating with the mental branch of the inferior dental nerve, supplies the muscles of the lower lip. One superficial branch is continued along the margin of the lower jaw to the chin. Fig. 326.

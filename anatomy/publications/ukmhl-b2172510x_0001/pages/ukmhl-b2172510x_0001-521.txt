501 VEINS OF THE CEREBRUM. Sylvius to enter the cavernous sinus. Another is the great anastomotic vein of Trolard, which commences on the surface of the parietal lobe, where it anastomoses with the upper cerebral veins, and runs forwards in the posterior limb of the fissure of Sylvius ; it perforates the dura mater near the apex of the small wing of the sphenoid, and then passes back- wards in the middle fossa of the base of the skull, forming a communi- cation with the middle meningeal veins, to join the superior petrosal sinus. The deep cerebral veins are collected into two trunks, which are known as the veins of Galen. These vessels commence close to the Fig. 291.

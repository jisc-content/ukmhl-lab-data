BRANCHES OF THE INTERNAL ILIAC ARTERY. 453 deferens, in company with which it descends in the spermatic cord as far as the testicle, where it anastomoses with the spermatic artery. This branch may reinforce or even replace the last-mentioned vessel. Besides the superior and inferior vesical arteries, other small offsets are frequently furnished to the bladder from the obturator, sciatic, or other branches of the internal iliac artery. The vaginal artery (v) (vesico-vaginal) in the female corresponds to the inferior vesical artery in the male. Arising from the anterior Fig. 270.

It anastomoses behind the vagina with the corresponding artery of the opposite side. 3. The middle hemorrhoidal artery (v) is frequently derived from the inferior vesical or the internal pudic artery. It ramifies on the lower part of the rectum, and anastomoses with the other hemorrhoidal and the inferior vesical arteries.

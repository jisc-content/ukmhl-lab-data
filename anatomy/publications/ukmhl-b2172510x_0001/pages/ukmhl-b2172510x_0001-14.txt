ADVERTISEMENT. viii Mr. Schafer, and the remaining part, or that on Embryology, of Dr. Thomson. Very considerable changes have been made in the departments of Histology, the Central Nervous System, and Embryology. In connection with his part of the work, Mr. Schafer desires to acknowledge the assistance he has received from the systematic works of Henle, Luschka, W. Krause, and Schwalbe, and from Klein’s “Atlas of Histology,’’ and Kanvier’s “ Traite technique d’histologie.’’ And Dr. Thomson has to ac- knowledge his obligations to the new edition of Kolliker’s “ Entwicklungsgeschiclite,” to His’s “ Anatomie Mensclilicher Embryonen,” and to the “ Comparative Embryology ” of the lamented F. M. Balfour. A considerable number of new figures have been introduced into the present Edition, some having been substituted for former ones now withdrawn, others added as new illustrations. They are partly from original drawings, and partly electrotype copies of figures in other published works, for their courtesy in allowing copies of which the Editors have to thank the respective Authors and Publishers. October, 1882.

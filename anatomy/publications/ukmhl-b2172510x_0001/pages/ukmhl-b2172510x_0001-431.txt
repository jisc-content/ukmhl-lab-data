Fig. 250.â€”Superficial view of the arteries of the front of the arm, forearm and hand (from Tiedemann). a, deltoid muscle ; b, biceps ; b', its semilunar fascia ; c, long head of the triceps ; c', its inner head ; cl, pronator teres ; e, flexor carpi radialis ; f, palmaris longus ; /', its tendon spreading in the upper part of the palmar fascia, from which, on the inner side, the palmaris brevis muscle is seen rising ; g, flexor carpi ulnaris ; h, supinator longus ; i, extensor carpi radialis longior; l, extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis ; m, flexor sub- limis digitorum ; 1, placed on the tendon of the latissimus dorsi, the lower part of the axillary artery, continued into the brachial ; 2, superior profunda ; 3, inferior profunda ; 4, anastomotic ; 5, near the division of the brachial artery into ulnar and radial, indicates the origin of the radial recurrent artery; 5', lower part of the radial artery, where it gives off the superficial volar, and turns round the wrist ; 6', the lower part of the ulnar artery, near the place where it passes down to form the superficial palmar arch ; digital branches of the superficial arch ; 9, radialis indicis ; on the thumb are seen the two branches of the princeps pollicis artery. below, and which proceed backwards from the main trunk, the brachial artery gives small offsets to the integument of the arm, and a variable number of muscular branches, Avhich pass forwards and outwards to the coraco-brachialis, biceps and brachial is anticns muscles ; one more constant branch, arising from the upper part of the artery (sometimes from the superior profunda), passes outwards transversely in front of the humerus and terminates in the lower part of the deltoid muscle. 1. The superior profunda artery (iv), the largest of the branches, arises from the posterior part of the brachial artery, just below the border of the teres major, and inclines backwards as it descends to reach the interval between the inner and long heads of the triceps muscle. Accompanying the musculo- spiral nerve, it then winds round the back of the humerus, in the spiral groove, and under cover of the outer head of the triceps. In its course it gives off several branches to the three heads of the triceps; one offset passes upwards between the long and outer heads of that muscle, to anastomose Fi

60 BONES OF THE HEAD. narrower part lies between the roof and the external wall. The optic foramen is internal and superior to the sphenoidal fissure. In the angle between the external wall and the floor is the spheno-maxillary fissure, bounded by the sphenoid, palate, superior maxillary, and malar bones, and leading into the spheno-maxillary fossa at its back part, and the zygomatic fossa at its fore part. Passing forwards from the margin of the spheno-maxillary fissure is the commencement of the infraorbital canal, grooving the posterior part of the floor of the orbit. On the inner wall in front is the lachrymal groove, formed by the superior maxillary and lachrymal bones, and leading into the nasal duct; farther back, between the ethmoid and frontal bones, are the anterior and posterior internal orbital canals: on the roof at its anterior margin, is the supra- orbital foramen or notch ; within the external angular process is the fossa for the lachrymal gland; and in the outer wall are the temporal canal of the malar bone and one or two other minute foramina.

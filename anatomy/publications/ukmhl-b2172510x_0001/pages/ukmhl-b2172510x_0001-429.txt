409 BRACHIAL ARTERY. Collateral circulation.—After ligature of the third part of the axillary artery, the circulation in the upper limb is carried on by means of the anastomoses of the posterior circumflex and superior profunda arteries, and of smaller branches of the axillary and brachial arteries in the coraco-brachialis, biceps, and triceps muscles. BRACHIAL ARTERY (II). The brachial or humeral artery, the continuation of the axillary, extends from the lower border of the teres major muscle to about a finger’s breadth below the bend of the elbow, or to a point opposite the inner border of the neck of the radius, where it divides into the radial and ulnar arteries. The artery gradually inclines from the inner side to the fore part of the limb, lying in the depression along the inner border of the coraco-brachialis and biceps muscles ; and a line drawn on the surface of the arm along this hollow will indicate the course of the vessel. To command the flow of blood through the artery at its upper part Fig. 248.—Dissection of the axilla and inner side of the arm to show the axillary and brachial yessels (from R. Quain). J Portions of the pectoral muscles have been removed so as to expose the axillary vessels : a, insertion, and b, origin of the pectoralis major ; 1, 1, axillary artery ; 1', placed on a part of the sheath of the brachial vessels, and 1", on the lower part of the biceps muscle, point to the brachial artery surrounded by its vense comites ; 2, 2, axillary vein ; 3, 3, basilic vein ; the upper figure is placed on the triceps muscle, the lower on the fascia near the junction of the ulnar veins ; on the basilic vein are seen the ramifications of the internal cutaneous nerve ; +, +, median nerve ; 4, on the deltoid, and 4', near the clavicular part of the great pectoral muscle, mark the cephalic vein joining the axillary vein ; 5, 5, placed on the divided portions of the pectoralis minor, point to the origin and branches of the acromio-thoracic artery ; 6, placed on a group of axillary glands, indicates the alar thoracic and subscapular vessels ; 7, placed on the trunk of the axillary vein, points to one of the brachial vensa eomites, which, being joined by the other higher up, passes into the axillary vein ; the ulnar nerve is seen passing behind the basilic vein towards the inner condyle; near 1, placed on the coraco-brachialis muscle, is seen the musculo-cutaneous nerve before it jiasses through that muscle ; near 2, placed on the tendon of the latissimus dorsi muscle, a portion of the nerve of Wrisberg.

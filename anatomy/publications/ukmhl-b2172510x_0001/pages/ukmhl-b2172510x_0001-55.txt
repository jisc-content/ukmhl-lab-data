PARIETAL BONE. 35 The inner surface is concave, the deepest part, opposite the parietal eminence, being known as the parietal fossa; it is marked by shallow depressions corresponding with the convolutions of the brain, and by Fig. 29.—External surface Piw. 29. OF THE EIGHT PARIETAL BONE. (A. T.) § 1, posterior superior angle ; 2, anterior superior angle ; 3, posterior inferior angle; 4, anterior inferior angle, articu- lating with the great wing of the sphenoid bone ; from 1 to 2, superior border in the sagittal suture ; from 2 to 4, anterior border in the coronal suture; from 1 to 3, posterior border in the lambdoid suture ; from 4 to 6, margin of the squamous suture ; from 3 to 6, margin articulating with mastoid ; 5, temporal line above which is the parietal eminence; 8, parietal fora- men. narrower furrows branch- ing upwards and back- wards from the lower border for the middle meningeal vessels. The largest of these grooves running from the anterior inferior angle is sometimes converted into a canal for a shoi t distance. A slight depression along the inner part of Fig. 30.—The parietal bone FROM THE INSIDE. (A.T.) 5 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, & 8, indicate the same parts as in the last figure : between 1 & 2 the half groove of the su- perior longitudinal sinus ; 3', groove of the lateral sinus; 7, the ramified grooves of the meningeal vessels; above x the groove is converted into a canal; 9, the irregular pits for the Pacchionian bodies. the superior border forms, with the one of the oppo- site side, the groove of the longitudinal sinus ; and a depression at the posterior inferior angle forms a small part of the Fig. 30. groove of the lateral sinus, blear the upper border there are in most skulls, but particularly in those of old persons, small irregular pits, lodging the Pacchionian bodies. Borders.—The anterior, superior, and posterior borders are deeply serrated. The inferior border presents in the greater part of its extent a x> 2

INFERIOR MAXILLARY XERYE. 565 bone, while the posterior traverses the petro-squamons fissure and is dis- tributed to the mucous lining of the mastoid cells (Luschka). The deep temporal nerves (figs. 316 and 322) are usually three in number, but are subject to considerable variety in their arrangement. The anterior is given off by the buccal nerve after it has perforated the external pterygoid, and ascends to supply the foremost part of the temporal muscle. The middle passes outwards above the external pterygoid and turns upwards close to the bone to enter the deep surface of the muscle. The posterior is generally conjoined with the masseteric nerve, and, taking- a course similar to the middle branch, ramifies in the hinder part of the muscle. The number of these nerves is frequently reduced by the union of the middle with either of the other branches. The masseteric nerve likewise passes above the external pterygoid, r;g. 3J2. Fig. 322.—View of the branches of the inferior maxillary nerve feom the outer side (from Sappey, after Hirsehfehl and Leveille). § The zygoma and part of the ramus of the jaw have been removed ; the dental canal has been opened up ; the lower part of the temporal muscle has been taken away, and the masseter muscle turned down : 1, masseteric nerve ; 2, posterior deep temporal nerve ; 3, buccal nerve ; 4, branch of the facial; 5, anterior deep temporal nerve ; 6, filaments given by the buccal to the external pterygoid muscle ; 7, middle deep temporal nerve ; 8, auriculo-temporal nerve ; 9, its temporal branches ; 10, its branches to the meatus and auricle ; 11, its union with the facial ; 12, lingual nerve ; 13, mylo-hyoid nerve ; 14, inferior dental nerve ; 15, its twigs to the teeth ; 16, mental branch ; 17, branch of the facial uniting with the mental.

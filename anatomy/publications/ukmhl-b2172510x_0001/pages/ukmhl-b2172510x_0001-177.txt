THE ELBOW-JOINT. 137 THE ELBOW-JOINT. The lower extremity of the humerus is in contact with the ulna and radius at the elbow, and forms with them a hinge-joint. The great sigmoid cavity of the ulna articulates with the trochlea of the humerus, so as to admit of flexion and extension only; while the cup-shaped depression on the head of the radius is fitted to turn freely on the rounded capitellum. These bones are united principally by strong lateral ligaments. The internal lateral ligament, triangular in shape, consists of anterior and posterior thickened bands, and an intermediate thinner part. Fig. 133.â€”Ligaments of tiie elbow-joint. (A. T.) J A, from the outer side and behind ; B, from the front ; C, from the inner side and behind. 1, internal lateral ligament ; 2, external lateral ; 3, the middle strongest part of the anterior ligament; 4, orbicular ligament; 5, posterior ligament, represented as wrinkled from relaxation in extension. In these figures the oblique ligament and upper part of the interosseous membrane are also represented below the elbow-joint. The anterior band springs from the lower and fore part of the internal condyle of the humerus, and is inserted into the coronoid process, along the inner margin of the sigmoid cavity. The posterior part, broader and stronger, passes from theunder and back part of the condyle to the inner border of the olecranon ; and the intermediate fibres are connected with a small transverse band, which passes over the notch between the olecranon and the coronoid process. The external lateral ligament, intimately connected with the tendinous attachment of the extensor muscles, is shorter and narrower than the internal. It is attached superiorly to a depression below the external condyle of the humerus, and inferiorly becomes blended with the

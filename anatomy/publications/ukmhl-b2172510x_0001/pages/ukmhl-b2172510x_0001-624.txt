Small muscular brandies.—The branches for the scaleni and longus colli muscles spring in an irregular manner from the lower cervical nerves close to their place of emergence from the intervertebral foramina. Fig. 333. Fig. 338.—Deep dissection op the axilla, showing the brachial plexus and neighbouring nerves (from Sappey, after Hirschfeld and Leveille). £ The clavicle has been sawn through near its sternal end, and is turned aside with the muscles attached to it ; the suhclavius and the greater and lesser pectoral muscles have been removed from the front of the axilla : I, ansa hvpoglossi; 2, pneumo-gastric; 3, phrenic, passing down to the inner side of the scalenus anticus muscle ; 4, anterior primary division of the fifth cervical nerve ; 5, 6, 7, the same of the sixth, seventh, and eighth cervical nerves ; 8, the same of the first dorsal nerve ; 9, 9, nerve to the suhclavius muscle, communicating with the phrenic nerve ; 10, posterior thoracic nerve distributed to the serratus magnus ; 11, external anterior thoracic nerve, passing into the great pectoral muscle ; 13, internal anterior thoracic, distributed to the lesser pectoral ; 14, twig of com- munication between these two nerves; 12, suprascapular nerve, passing through the suprascapular notch ; 15, upper subscapular nerve ; 16, lower subscapular nerve ; 17, long subscapular nerve ; 18, 21, small internal cutaneous nerve ; 19, union of this with the second and third intercostal nerves ; 20, lateral branch of the second intercostal; 22, internal cutaneous nerve ; 23, ulnar nerve to the inside of the axillary artery, passing behind the vein, and having, in this case, a root from the outer cord of the plexus ; 24, median nerve immediately below the place where its two roots embrace the artery, which is divided above this place ; 25, musculo-cutaneous nerve, passing into the coraco-brachialis muscle ; 26, musculo-spiral nerve, passing behind the divided axillary artery.

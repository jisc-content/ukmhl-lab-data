Above, the canal is limited by the arched lower borders of the internal oblique and transversalis muscles, while below, it is bounded by the broad surface of Poupart’s ligament, which separates it from the sheath of the large blood-vessels descending to the thigh, and from the femoral canal at the inner side of those vessels.

Quain.) ± The aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle having been divided and turned down, the internal oblique is brought into view with the spermatic cord escaping beneath its lower edge: 1, aponeuro- sis of the external oblique : 1', lower part of the same turned down ; 2, internal oblique muscle ; 3, sper- matic cord ; 4, saphenous vein. ternal iliac artery is below it. The spermatic cord, which occupies the inguinal canal, is composed of the arte- ries, veins, lympha- tics, nerves, and ex- cretory duct of the testis (vas deferens), together with a quantity of loose areolar tissue mixed up with those parts.

OSSIFICATION OF THE HUMERUS. 101 the other three nuclei coalesce to form an epiphysis, -which is united to the shaft in the 16th or 17th year. Fig. 81. Fig. 81.—Ossification of the humerus (R. Quain). A, from a full grown foetus ; B, at two years ; C, in tlie third year ; D, at the begin- ning of the fifth year ; E, at about the twelfth year ; F, at the age of puberty. 1, the primary centre for the shaft; 2, nucleus for the head ; 3, that for the great tuberosity ; 4, for the capitellum and adjacent part of the trochlea; 5, for the internal condyle ; 6, for the inner part of the trochlea ; 7, for the external condyle. In this and the following figures the more advanced bones are shown on a smaller scale than the earlier ones. The radius is developed from a nucleus, which appears in the middle of the shaft in the 8th week, and from an epiphysial nucleus in each extremity which Fig. 82. C D Fig. 82.—Ossification of the radius (R. Quain). A, the radius of a full-grown fcetus ; B, at about two years of age ; C, at five years ; D, at about eighteen years. 1, shaft; 2, ossific point of the lower epiphysis ; 3, that of the upper end. In D, the upper epiphysis is united to the shaft, while the lower is still separate.

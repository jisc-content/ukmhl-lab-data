PYEAMIDALIS MUSCLE. 331 Tlie tendinous intersections have been regarded as indications of the ab- dominal ribs of some of the lower animals ; they are rather vestiges of the septa between the original vertebral myotomes. They sometimes extend outwards from the rectus, and penetrate partially into the internal oblique. For tlie explanation of the references in the upper part of the figure see p. 199. e, c, cartilages of the fifth ribs ; d, ensiform process ; c, symphysis pubis ; /, an- terior superior iliac spine ; 12, origin of the serratus magnus; 13,13, on the right side, the rectus abdominis ; on the left side, 13', 13', the divided ends of the same muscle, a portion being removed} 14, pyramidalis muscle, exposed on the left side ; 15, on the right side, the internal oblique muscle; 15', origin of its lower fibres from the deep surface of Poupart’s ligament; 15", conjoined tendon of the in- ternal oblique and transver- salis; 15, on the left side, cut edge of the internal ob- lique, shown diagrammatic- ally, to indicate the manner in which its aponeurosis splits to form the sheath of the rectus muscle ; 16, aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle, uniting in front with the sheath of the rectus. The pyramidalis is a small muscle rest- ing on the lower part of tlie rectus, in the sheath of which it is contained. It arises from tlie front of the pubis and the ligaments of the symphysis, and, becoming narrow as it ascends over the lower third of the interval between the umbilicus and pubis, is inserted into the linea alba.

Varieties.—This muscle varies greatly in size, and it is often absent on one or both sides, in which case the size of the lower part of the rectus is increased : in some instances it has been found to be double.

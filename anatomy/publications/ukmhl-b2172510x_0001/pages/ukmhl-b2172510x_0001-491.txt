THE ARTERIES OP THE PELVIS, THIGH, AND POPLITEAL SPACE (from Tiedemann). | CV,< ' a, iliac crest; b, attachment of the great sacro-seiatic ligament to the tuberosity of the ischium ; c, great trochanter; d, integu- ment around the anus ; e, great sciatic nerve ; /, semitendinosus and semimembranosus muscles ; <j, head of the fibula ; 1, gluteal artery; 2, pudic ; 3, sciatic ; 4, first perforating artery; 4', its branches to the hamstring muscles ; 5, 6, branches of the lower perforating arteries ; 7, 7, popliteal artery, near the upper figure the origin of the superior muscular branches ; 8, placed on the tendon of the adductor mag- nus, near the origin of the su- perior articular branches; 9, the anastomosis of the external superior articular with other branches; 10,10,sural branches; 11, anterior tibial recurrent artery. (b) The transverse branch, larger than the foregoing, passes back- wards between the quadra- tus femoris and adductor magnus muscles, and is distributed to the upper parts of the hamstring muscles, anastomosing with the sciatic and first perfo- rating arteries. 3. The perforating arte- ries are subject to consider- able variation in their arrangement, but they are generally four in number, including the terminal branch of the parent vessel. They pass backwards close to the femur, through small tendinous arches in the insertion of the adductor magnus muscle, and give considerable branches to the hamstring muscles, as well as small twigs to the great sciatic nerve, and a series of cutaneous

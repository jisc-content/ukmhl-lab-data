MUSCLES OF THE UPPER LIMB. 194 Fig. 156. Fig. 156.—Superficial view of THE MUSCLES OF THE TRUNK, shoulder and hip. (After Bour- gery.) (A. T.) } o, external occipital protuber- ance ; C, transverse process of the atlas ; D, first dorsal vertebra ; L, first lumbar vertebra; S, first piece of the sacrum ; Co, first piece of the coccyx ; a, acromion ; b, base of the scapula ; i, crest of the ilium ; 1, sterno-mastoid muscle ; 2, splenius, levator anguli scapulae, and other deep muscles ; 3, 3, upper and lower ends of the line of origin of the trapezius muscle ; 3', triangular tendon attached to the inner end of the spine of the scapula ; +, half of the oval ten- don belonging to the two trapezius muscles in the lower cervical and upper dorsal region; 4, 4, latissi- mus dorsi; 4', 4", line along which the latissimus dorsi takes origin from the lumbar fascia ; 5, infra- spinatus ; 6, teres minor ; 7, teres major; 8, deltoid ; 9, external oblique muscle of the abdomen ; 10, gluteus medius, covered by the fascia lata; 11, 11, line of origin of the gluteus maximus from the posterior part of ilium to the coccyx ; 11', its insertion into the fascia lata over the great trochanter ; 11", a part of its in- sertion into the femur; 12, biceps ; 13, semitendinosus ; 14, adductor magnus ; 15, gracilis. cutaneous in the interval be- tween the trapezius and latis- simus dorsi ; the extent of this portion varies with the position of the scapula, being increased when the arm is raised from the side. The rhomboidei cover the greater part of the serratus pos- ticus superior, and the posterior scapular artery descends on their deep surface. Varieties. — Both rhomboid muscles are liable to variations in the extent of their vertebral and scapular attachments. An additional muscle has been ob- served running close and parallel to the upper border of the minor, from the scapula to the occipital bone, and has been called rhomboideus occipitalis after a similar muscle occurring in some animals.

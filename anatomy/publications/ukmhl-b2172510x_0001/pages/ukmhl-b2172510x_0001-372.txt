352 ARCH OF THE AORTA. ARCH OF THE AORTA. The arch of the aorta commences at the upper part of the base of the left ventricle of the heart, behind the pulmonary artery. At first it passes upwards and to the right side, somewhat in the direction of the heart itself, and crosses obliquely be- hind the sternum, approaching at the same time nearer to that bone. Having gained the level of the upper border of the second costal cartilage of the right side, the vessel alters its course, Fig. 227.

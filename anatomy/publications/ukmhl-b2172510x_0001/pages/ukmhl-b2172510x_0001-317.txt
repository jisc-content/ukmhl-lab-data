MUSCLES OF THE PHAEYXX. 297 Fig. 203. pharynx ; 4, middle constrictor ; MUSCLES OF THE PHARYNX. The pharynx, the dilated upper part of the alimentary tube extending from the base of the skull to the oesophagus, presents at the sides and back a continuous wall, in great part formed and supported by distinct muscles resting posteriorly against the vertebral column, while in front it is open towards the nasal cavity, the mouth, and the larynx. The muscles entering into the construction of the wall of the pharynx are disposed in two layers, viz., an outer layer in which the fibres have a generally transverse direction, and an inner one composed of longitudinal fibres. The outer layer includes three muscles named constrictors, all of which spring in front from bones or cartilages, and terminate behind, where they are much expanded and overlap one another from below up- wards, by joining their fellows in the middle line, forming in the upper part a mesial tendinous raph6. The inner layer comprises the elevator muscles of the pharynx, two in number, viz., the stylo-pharyngeus and the palato-pharyngeus, the latter of which will be described together with the muscles of the soft palate. The inferior constrictor muscle, the broadest and thickest of the three, arises by a series of slips from the side of the cricoid cartilage at Fig. 203.â€”Deep muscles of the cheek, pharynx, &c.

It curves backwards and inwards, and unites with its fellow in the middle line at the back of the pharynx. The direction of the inferior fibres is horizontal; the rest ascend with increasing degrees of obliquity, and the highest fibres

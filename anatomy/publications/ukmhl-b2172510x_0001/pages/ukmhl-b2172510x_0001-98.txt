'3 BONES OF THE HEAD. branchial arches, hut which, although indicated in the early embryo, never attain even the cartilaginous condition in man and the higher animals. Together with the foregoing are associated two other sets of elements, viz., 1st, the Sense capsules or cavities, which are interposed between other bones, and are con- nected with the lodgment of the higher organs of sense, the nose, eye, and ear ; and in the case of the nose (ethmo- and maxilloturbinals), but more especially of the ear (periotic), the capsules are formed of special and complex bony apparatus ; and 2nd, Superadded or investing bones, as the nasal, lachrymal, malar, and vomer, which are extraneous to the more fundamental osseous elements. Vertebrate theory of the skull.—The idea that the skull consists essentially of a series of vertebra?, the superior or neural arches of which have undergone great expansion so as to predominate over the less developed inferior or visceral arches, occurred to Goethe in 1791, but was first published by Oken, by whom it was independently conceived and worked out, in 1807. The theory, however, has undergone various modifications in the hands of the successive comparative anatomists by whom it has been supported, while others of distinction have refused to admit the validity of the grounds on which it has been framed. More recent researches, and especially those of Parker and Gegenbaur, have thrown much new light on the subject. Among the arguments in favour of this theory, may be specially mentioned here :—the general plan of construction of the skull as above explained, viz., a series of central parts, supporting superior and inferior arches which surround the preaxial portions of the cerebro-spinal nervous centre and of the alimentary canal in a way resembling that in which they are enclosed more postaxially by the vertebrae and the appended costal arches; the origin of the walls of the cranial cavity from the same embryonic elements as the vertebrae; and the pro- longation of the notochord in the embryo a considerable distance into the base of the cranium. On the other hand it is to be remarked that the noto- chord does not extend through the whole length of the cranio-facial axis, but terminates close behind the region of the sella turcica, being directed towards the dorsum sellse, and thus leaves a part of the basisphenoid, and the whole of the presphenoid and mesethmoid unoccupied by any true central or vertebral axis ; also that the superior arches differ notably from the neural arches of the verte- brae, not only in being constructed of more numerous osseous elements, but also in being in great part developed in membrane instead of in cartilage, while the inferior arches, besides being also in part intramembranous ossifications, are formed in much closer connection with the wall of the alimentary canal than the ribs, which are laid down in the body wall or somatopleure. (The foetal conditions here referred to will be fully explained in the section on Embryology in Vol. II.) The investigations of the last few years, however, both upon the structure and relations of the head skeleton in its more primitive form, as met with in the lower vertebrates, and upon its mode of development in the embryo, have given strong support to the view that at least the posterior portion of the skull, the part behind the region of the pituitary fossa, has in some degree a vertebrate nature; i.e., that it has had its origin in the coalescence, modification and partial suppression of a series of segments, the number of which is inferred, from the disposition of the visceral arches and of the cranial nerves, to have been con- siderable, but cannot, in the present state of our knowdedge, be precisely deter- mined. To these, other elements, investing bones and dermal ossifications, appear to have been added, giving rise to the membrane bones which consti- tute the roof of the skull and the anterior visceral arches. As to the origin of the anterior portion of the base of the cranium, and especially as to the nature of the trabecula cranii, the two bars prolonged forwards from the extremity of the mass investing the notochord, through the region subsequently becoming the sella turcica, and forming by their union in front a mesial plate in which the presphenoid and mesethmoid are developed, the opinions of observers are still divided, some recognizing in them a foremost pair of visceral arches, while others oppose this view. This, however, is only one among several points which require farther elucidation before any system of cranial morphology worthy of

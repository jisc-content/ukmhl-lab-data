COMMON CAROTID ARTERIES. 363 wards against the vertebral column. The inferior thyroid artery crosses behind the carotid sheath. Internally, the vessel is in relation with the trachea, the thyroid body (which often overlaps the artery), the larynx, the oesophagus, and the Fig. 233. Fig. 233.â€” Superficial dissection of the right side of the neck to show the carotid and subclavian arteries, &c. (from R. Quain). J a, angle of the jaw and masseter muscle ; b, parotid gland ; c, submaxillary gland ; d, mylo-hyoid muscle below the anterior belly of the digastric ; e, anterior, e', posterior belly of the omo-hyoid ; /, sterno-hyoid ; g, sterno-thyroid ; 1, upon the sterno-mastoid muscle, points by a line to the upper part of the common carotid artery ; 2, upon the scalenus anticus, points to the third part of the subclavian artery ; 3, upon the scalenus medius, points to the superficial cervical artery crossing the nerves of the brachial plexus ; 4, posterior scapular artery, passing under the levator scapulae muscle ; 5, suprascapular artery ; 6, external carotid artery ; 6', internal carotid artery ; 7, upon the thyro-hyoid muscle, points to the superior thyroid artery giving superiorly its hyoid branch ; 8, lingual artery ; 9, placed on the stylo-hyoid muscle, indicates the facial artery ; 10, occipital artery, from the root of which the small sterno-mastoid artery is given of!'; between the occipital and the facial arteries, +, upon the posterior belly of the digastric points to the continuation of the external carotid artery before it passes under that muscle.

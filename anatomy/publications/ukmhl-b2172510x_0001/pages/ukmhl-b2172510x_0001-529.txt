509 SUPERFICIAL VEINS OF FOREARM. Fig. 295.â€”The superficial veins of the upper limb, from before (the arrangement of the veins of the hand after Braune). (G. D. T.). i 1, cephalic vein ; 2, basilic ; 3, radial ; 4, median-cephalic ; 5, median, receiving a large branch from the outer side of the wrist, and being joined near its division by the deep median vein ; t>, median-basilic ; 7, anterior ulnar ; 8, posterior ulnar vein. The posterior ulnar vein com- mences in the inner part of the dorsal plexus of the hand, and also receives a communicating branch issuing behind the abductor minimi digiti muscle from the deep veins of the palm (Braune). It proceeds along the posterior aspect of the ulnar border of the limb, lying- on the surface of the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle, and just below (occasionally above) the internal condyle of the humerus turns forwards to join the median-basilic division of the median vein, thus giving rise to the basilic vein. The anterior ulnar vein, much smaller than the posterior, ascends along the inner part of the front of the forearm, and at the bend of the elbow either joins the posterior ulnar or opens separately into the median-basilic vein. The median vein is generally of small size, and results from the union of two or three vessels which pass upwards from a fine plexus in the palm of the hand, receiving other branches in the forearm and communicating freely on either side with the radial and ulnar veins ; but not unfrequently it is large and forms the principal out- let of the dorsal plexus of the hand on the outer side, in which case the radial vein is proportionally reduced in size. It ascends to the hollow in front of the elbow, and there terminates by dividing into the median-basilic and median-cephalic veins, which diverge upwards from each other, lying one on each side of the prominent tendon of the biceps muscle. Close to its bifurca- tion this vessel receives a short wide branch, the deep median vein, which Fig. 295. if j

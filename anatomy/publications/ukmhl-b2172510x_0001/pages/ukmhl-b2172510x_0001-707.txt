SUPERFICIAL ANATOMY OF THE ELBOW AND FOREARM. 687 of forearm muscles. The sharp upper edge of the bicipital fascia may also be felt, aud, when the muscle is forcibly contracted, seen, as it passes downwards and inwards between the median-basilic vein and the lower part of the brachial artery. THE FOREARM. From the olecranon, the sinuous posterior border of the ulna is to be followed down the forearm, corresponding to a superficial furrow between the ulnar flexor and extensor muscles of the wrist; the border becomes rounded off in the lower third, but a narrow strip of the bone is still sub- cutaneous, leading down to the styloid process. When the hand is supinated, the styloid process of the ulna is exposed at the inner and posterior part of the wrist ; but if the hand he pronated, then the skin is stretched over the opposite (outer) part of the head of the fixed ulna, which projects between the extensor carpi ulnaris and extensor minimi digit! muscles. Close below the outer condyle of the humerus, the head of the radius may be felt moving beneath the muscles as the forearm is alternately pronated and supinated. The upper half of the shaft of the radius is too thickly covered by muscles to be distinctly made out ; the lower half is nearer to the surface, and can be readily examined between and through the surrounding muscles and tendons ; at the lower end, the styloid process is superficial in front and behind, being covered ex- ternally by the tendons of the extensor ossis metacarpi and primi internodii pollicis muscles ; and the prominent outer edge of the groove for the extensor secundi internodii pollicis is also to be distinguished. Along the inner and fore part of the forearm, is the prominence formed by the pronato-flexor muscles, the great mass covering the ulna inter- nally being formed by the flexor profundus digitorum beneath the flexor carpi ulnaris. A short distance below the internal condyle, a slight groove runs obliquely downwards and inwards across the muscles, caused by the prolongation of the fibres of the bicipital fascia. Near the wrist, the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris can be felt, passing down to the pisiform bone, and immediately external to the tendon the beating of the ulnar artery is perceptible. About the centre of the front of the wrist, the tendon of the palmaris longus descends, being the most prominent of all the tendons here, and a little external to this, the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis is also visible. Outside the latter is a hollow in which the radial vessels are placed, and where the pulse is commonly felt: immediately internal to the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis, lies the median nerve. Along the outer border of the forearm, the long supinator and radial extensor muscles of the wrist descend, becoming tendinous and smaller below the middle ; and in the lower third of the forearm a smaller pro- minence, directed obliquely downwards, outwards and forwards, results from the presence of the extensor muscles of the thumb crossing over the long tendons. On the back of the forearm are the extensors of the fingers, the extensor carpi ulnaris, and the anconeus, all of which may be individually distinguished in thin persons. Numerous cutaneous veins are seen on the forearm, arising principally from the network on the dorsum of the hand, and forming two main trunks, the posterior ulnar and the radial, which ascend respectively along the inner and outer borders of the limb, and incline forwards to their termination in front of the elbow ; although in many cases another large vein is present (assisting or even replacing the radial vein), which

583 CRANIAL NERVES. A. Branches of communication. Close below the skull the hypoglossal nerve is united by a considerable twig with the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic, by one or more filaments with the loop between the first and second cervical nerves, and with the ganglion of the trunk of the vagus by fibres which pass between the two nerves where they are in close connection with one another. As the nerve turns round the occipital artery, it is joined by the small lingual branch of the vagus (p. 582), and in the submaxillary region, it is connected with the lingual branch of the fifth nerve by one or two slender loops over the fore part of the hyo-glossus muscle.

546 CRANIAL NERVES The Roman numerals from I to XII indicate the roots of the several cranial nerves as they lie in or near their foramina of exit ; V, is upon the large root of the fifth with the Gasserian ganglion in front; C I, the suboccipital or first cervical nerve ; C VIII, the eighth. The branches of the nerves are marked as follows, viz. :—1, supraorbital branch of the fifth ; 2, laclir vmal passing into the gland ; 3, nasal passing towards the anterior internal orbital canal, and giving the long root to the ciliary ganglion, 4'; 3', termination of the nasal nerve ; 4, lower branch of the third nerve ; 5, superior maxillary division of the fifth passing into the infraorbital canal; 5', the same issuing at the infraorbital foramen and being distributed as inferior palpebral, lateral nasal, and superior labial nerves, 5" ; b, ganglion of Meckel and Vidian nerve passing back from it ; 6', palatine and other nerves descending frofn it; G", large superficial petrosal nerve ; 7, posterior dental nerves ; t , placed in the antrum, which has been opened, points to the anterior dental nerve ; 8, inferior maxillary division of the fifth immediately below the foramen ovale ; 8', some of the muscular branches coming from it ; 8-f, the auriculo-temporal branch cut short, and above it the small superficial petrosal nerve connected with the facial; 9, buccal and ex- ternal pterygoid ; 10, lingual or gustatory nerve ; 10', its distribution to the side and front of the tongue and to the sublingual gland ; 10", submaxillary ganglion ; below 10, the chorda tympani passing forwards from the facial above 12, to joiii the lingual nerve ; 11, Fig. 313.—A.

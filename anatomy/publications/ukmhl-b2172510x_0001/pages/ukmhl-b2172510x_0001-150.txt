130 MORPHOLOGY OF THE BONES OF THE LIMBS Fife. 108. Fig. 107. Figs. 107 & 108.—Sketch OF THE BONES OF THE THORACIC AND PELVIC LIMBS SO PLACED AS TO SHOW CORRESPONDING TARTS IN BOTH. (A. T.) i The preaxial borders of both limbs are towards the reader’s right hand, and the dorsal or true ex- tensor surfaces are shown throughout the whole ex- tent of the limbs. The somewhat artificial repre- sentation given in these figures cannot be obtained from a single view of the specimens in one position, but it is easily brought out by slightly shifting the bones or changing the point of view. The hu- meral tuberosities are separated so as to show them on the borders of the bone. Fig. 107, Thoracic Limb : ssp, supraspinous or prescapular fossa; isp, in- fraspinous or postscapular fossa ; ssc, a small part of subscapular fossa ; bs, base of scapula ; sa, su- perior angle ; ia, inferior angle; sp, spine ; ac, acromion; cr, coracoid process ; gb, glenoid bor- der with place of attach- ment of triceps muscle; gc, glenoid cavity; h, humerus, preaxial border; tm, large or preaxial tuber- osity ; tp, small or post- axial tuberosity; cr, radial condyle; cu, ulnar con- dyle ; r, radius; u,ulna ; o, olecranon; px, pollex side; pi, pisiform and postaxial side of hand. Fig. 108, Pelvic Limb: ss, sacral surface of ilium ; il, iliac fossa ; di, a small part of dorsum ilii or gluteal sur- face ; ic, crest of ilium ; as, anterior superior spinous process ; ipl, ilio- pectineal line; ep, pec- tineal eminence; is, in- ferior spine and attach- ment of rectus muscle ; cc, cotyloid cavity ; sp, symphysis pubis; isc, ischium ; /, femur, its preaxial border ; tip, lesser or preaxial trochanter ; trm, greater or postaxial trochanter; ct, tibial condyle ; cf, fibular condyle ; p, patella ; t, tibia ; tt, tubercle of tibia ; fi, fibula ; ho:, hallux ; ca, calcaneal tuberosity.

OSSIFICATION OF THE BONES OF TIIE FOOT. 127 terminal phalanx of the great toe ; 11, terminal phalanx ; 11*, its epiphysis. Fig. 106. Fig. 106.â€”Ossification of the bones of the foot (B. Quain). A, right foot of a fcetus of six months. The metatarsal hones and digital phalange? have each their shafts ossified from their primary centres; the tarsus is wholly cartila- ginous, excepting the os calcis, in which the nucleus of bone has just appeared. B, foot of a fcetus of seven or eight months. The astragalus shows a nucleus. C, from a child at birth ; the cuboid has begun to ossify. I), about a year old, showing a nucleus in the external cuneiform. E, in the third year ; ossification has reached the internal cuneiform. F, about four years old, showing ossification in the middle cuneiform and navicular bones, and in the epiphyses of the metatarsal bones and phalanges. Gr, about the age of puberty. Ossification is nearly complete in the tarsal bones ; an epiphysis has been formed on the tuberosity of the os calcis, and the epiphyses of the metatarsal bones and phalanges are shown separate. 1, nucleus of the os calcis ; 1* in Gr, the epiphysis of the os calcis ; 2, nucleus of the astragalus ; 3, of the cuboid ; 4, of the external cuneiform ; 5, of the internal cuneiform ; 6, of the navicular; 7, of the middle cuneiform; 8, metatarsal bones; 8*, distal epiphysis of the second metatarsal bone ; 8', proximal epiphysis of the first; 9, first phalanx of the second toe; 9*, proximal epiphysis of this phalanx ; 9', that of the first phalanx of the great toe; 10, second phalanx ; 10*, the epiphysis of this phalanx; 10', epiphysis of the

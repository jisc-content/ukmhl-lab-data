308 DORSAL MUSCLES OF TIIE TRUNK. Fig..208.—Deep muscles OF THE BACK. (A. T.) i On the left side the several parts of the erector spin® are nearly in their natural position, with the exception of the spinalis dorsi, which is drawn out from the spines of the vertebrae ; on the right side the spinalis dorsi has been entirely removed, the ilio-costalis drawn to the outer side so as to expose its accessory muscle, and the longissimus removed, excepting small portions at its insertions. Superiorly on the left side, the trache- lo-mastoid and complexus are left nearly in their natural positions ; while, on the right side, the trachelo-mastoid has been entirely removed, and the complexus, separated from its occipital attachment, has been spread out so as to stretch its vertebral attachments, a, external occipital protuberance ; b, mastoid process ; c, spi- nous process of the axis ; I, I, spinous process of the first dorsal vertebra and first rib; VI, VI, VI, sixth dorsal spine and transverse process and sixth rib; XII, XII, twelfth dorsal spine and twelfth rib. On the leftside, 1, complexus ; 2, trachelo-mastoid ; 3, ser- ratus posticus superior, detached from the spine and drawn upwards from the ribs; 4, 4, the slips of attachment of the serratus posticus inferior to the lowest four ribs ; 5, 5, 5, costal, and 5', iliac ori- gins of the latissimus dor- si; G +, tendon of origin of the erector spin® ; 6, upper part of the longissi- mus dorsi; 6', transversa- lis cervicis continued up from the longissimus ; 7, ilio-costalis drawn slightly inwards to show the slips of insertion into the lum- bar fascia and the various ribs ; inside the costal in- sertions are seen the ori- gins of the accessorius; 7',

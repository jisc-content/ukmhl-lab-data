314 MUSCLES OF TIIE THORAX. MUSCLES OF THE THORAX. The muscles of the thoracic wall are the intercostals, levatores cos- tarum, subcostals, and triangularis sterni, and along with these the diaphragm intervening between the thorax and abdomen may con- veniently be grouped. The intercostal muscles consist of two thin layers of short oblique fibres occupying the intercostal spaces : these layers are named respec- tively the external and internal muscles. Fig. 210. Fig. 210.â€”Intercostal muscles op the fifth and sixth spaces (after Cloquet). (A. T.) i A, from tlie side ; B, from behind. IV, fourth dorsal vertebra ; V, V, fifth rib and its cartilage; 1,1, levatores costarum muscles, short and long ; 2, 2, external intercostal muscle ; 3, 3, the internal intercostal layer, shown in the lower space by the removal of the external layer, and seen in A in the upper space, in front of the external layer : the deficiency of the internal layer towards the vertebral column is shown in B. The external intercostal muscles are stronger than the internal. Their fibres are intermixed with a considerable quantity of tendinous substance, and are directed obliquely downwards and forwards from the prominent lower margin of one rib to the upper border of the next. The extent of these muscles is generally from the tubercles of the ribs to the outer ends of the cartilages ; but in the upper three or four spaces they do not quite reach the ends of the ribs, while in the last two intervals they are continued forwards between the cartilages. Beyond the points at which the muscles cease the spaces arc occupied by the anterior intercostal aponeuroses, thin shining membranes, composed of fibres having the same direction as those of the external intercostal

If he be a careful dissector, the best pictures are those he makes with his scalpel—his actual dissections .... His dissections, however, vary from day to day, and he cannot always have these by him for reference. The present outlines have been designed to enable him to chronicle the most important facts by a method which appeals to the memory through the eye.’—Preface. l '-PABLETS OF ANATOMY AND PHYSIO- 1 LOGY.

SUBCLAVIAN ARTERIES. 389 Relation to nerves.—The pneumo-gastric nerve is in front of and parallel to the first part of the left subclavian artery, but in contact with it only at its lower part. The phrenic nerve descends over the artery along the inner margin of the scalenus muscle, immediately outside the Fig. 241.

228 Arteria iliaca interna. 575. The Arteries of the Internal Generative Organs of the Female. Posterior view. After a specimen of Hyrtl. 2/3 natural size. cl) The uterine artery, Art. uterina, passes downwards to the neck of the uterus, ascends in a tortuous course on the side of the organ to its fundus, supplies branches to the vagina and Portio vaginalis uteri and finally anastomoses with the ovarian (spermatic) artery. One branch, which runs in the round ligament, reaches the inguinal canal and communicates with the inferior epigastric artery. e) The internal or common p u d i c a r t e r y, Art. pudenda communis, leaves the pelvis by the great sacro-sciatic foramen and reenters it by the lesser sacro-sciatic foramen. It passes downwards on the inner surface of the ischium, curves forwards and upwards towards the pubic arch and divides here into the artery of the Corpus cavernosum and the dorsal artery of the penis or clitoris. The branches of the internal p u d i c are: 1. The middle h a e m o r r h o i d a 1, while still within the pelvis; 2. The inferior haemorrhoidal, two or three in number, pass through the ischio-rectal space to the M. levator ani and the anus; 3. The perineal or superficial perineal, which passes for- wards through the M. transversus perinei and gives off the posterior scrotal arteries in the male, the posterior 1 a b i a 1 in the female.

Organ of Vision. 218 294. The Eye and the Muscles of the Eyelid. The eyelids, Palpebrae, are moveable portions of integument, whose free margins limit the JRima palpebrarum; this latter ends in an acute outer angle, Canthus externus, and a rounded inner angle, Canthus interims. The eyelashes, Cilia, are attached to the free edges of each eyelid. The tarsi, Tarsus superior and Tarsus inferior, are placed in the mucous membrane of the eyelids, and are attached to the upper and lower margins of the orbit by the strong Ligamenta tarsi superioris et inferioris; the thick Ligamentum canthi internum runs from the inner canthus to the nasal process of the superior maxillary bone, and the broad Ligamentum canthi externum from the outer canthus to the frontal process of the malar bone. The ciliary muscle, M. ciliaris, lies upon the tarsus. Upon the posterior surface of the tarsal cartilages, or surrounded by them, are the sebaceous Meibomian glands (30—40 in the upper lid, 25—35 in the lower), whose ducts open on the posterior part of the free margin of the lids, and secrete the Sebum palpebrale seu Lema (Fig. 295, 296). The eyebrows, Supercilia, are the arched eminences of integu- ment, along the upper circumferences of the orbits, which support numerous short, thick hairs.

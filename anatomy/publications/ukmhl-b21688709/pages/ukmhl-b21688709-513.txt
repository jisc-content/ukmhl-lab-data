The subclavian vein, V. sub- clavia, receives the veins of the arm and shoulder. These are: 1. Deep brachial veins, Venae profundae braclui, for the bra- chial artery and its branches, which they accompany on both sides. They arise as palmar digital veins, form the superficial and deep venous arches, then radial and ulnar veins, finally two brachial veins which unite to form the single axillary vein, whose direct con- tinuation is the subclavian vein. 2. Superficial brachial veins, Venae snhcutaneae braclui, between skin and fascia, which, freely anastomosing with each other, arise from an arch, the Bete venosum manus dorsale. a) The cephalic vein com- mences at the dorsum of the thumb, passes along the inner side of the forearm, above the elbow in the Sul- cus bicipitalis externus, then between M. pectoralis major and M. deltoides, and terminates between these muscles in the axillary vein just below the clavicle. b) The basilic vein passes along the ulnar side of the forearm, at first usually double, then becoming single, ascends in the Sulcus bicipitalis internus, pierces the fascia in the middle of the upper arm and opens into the internal brachial vein. c) The median vein is either single or double, and divides into the median cephalic and the median basilic; the latter is usually the larger. An anastomosing branch for the deep radial or brachial veins is always present. 245 595. The Superficial Veins of the Upper Extremity. 32*

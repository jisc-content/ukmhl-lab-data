Organ of Hearing. 235 The three semicircular canals are: a superior, an inferior or posterior and an external; each stands at right angles to the other two. There are three orifices at one extremity, which are dilated, the enlargement being known as ampulla, but only two orifices at the opposite extremity, the superior and posterior canals joining together and opening by a common aperture. The exter- nal canal is the shortest, the posterior thelongest. The cochlea consists of a canal wound spirally around a central axis for 2*/2 turns; this central axis is called, for the first turn, Modiolus, for the second Columella, and for the uppermost half turn Lamina modioli. The apex of the cochlea is directed for- wards towards the inner wall of the tympanum, its base is turned towards the internal auditory meatus. â€” The spiral canal terminates in a cul-de- sac, the Cupula; here the Scy- plius Vieussenii or infundibu- lum of the cochlea is formed (Fig. 320). 321.

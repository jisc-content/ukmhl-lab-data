225 Avteria iliaca interna. 571. Course and Ramification of the Arteries of the Pelvis. View from behind, after removal of the posterior pelvic wall. c) The superior gluteal artery, Art. glutaea superior, the largest branch of the internal iliac artery, passes above the upper border of the pyriformis muscle through the great sacro-sciatic notch, to the gluteal muscles; one of its branches passes forwards between M. glutaeus maximus and medius, the other, larger, passes between M. glu- taeus medius and minimus. Both divide into a number of branches. The anterior branches of the internal iliac artery are: a) The obturator, Art. obturatoria; it passes through the obtu- rator canal in company with the obturator nerve and divides at the upper border of the M. obturatorius into an anterior or internal and a posterior or external branch. The internal ramifies in the MM. adductor femoris longus et brevis, pectineus and gracilis; the exter- nal sends the Art. acetabxdi to the IAg. teres of the hip-joint and finally distributes branches to the external rotator muscles.

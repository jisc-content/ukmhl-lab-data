Rectum. 30 359. Horizontal Section through the Pelvis at the lower border of the third sacral vertebra. After removal of the peritoneum the urinary bladder and collapsed rectum were turned for- wards. After J. Henle. The longitudinal muscular fibres of the large intestine are in the coecum and colon collected into three flat bands, the Fasciae, Taeniae Valsalvae s. Ligamenta coli (see Fig. 351); these are the Fascia omentalis, mcsenterica and libera. In the sigmoid flexure and rectum they are spread out into a uniform layer of longitudinal muscular fibres; the circular fibres form at the end of the rectum the internal sphincter muscle, M. sphincter ani interims. The other muscles at the end of the rectum are the 3L sphincter ani extcmus and M. levator ani; the origin and connection of the latter with the M. recto-coccygeus is evident from the figure. In the mucous membrane of the large intestine there are certain permanent folds, Plicae sigmoickae (see Fig. 355), containing circular fibres, the last of which lies about 3 inches above the anus; this mucous membrane has no villi, but there are crypts of Lieber- kiihn and solitary follicles. Towards the end of the rectum the folds of the mucous membrane form the Sinus Morgagni.

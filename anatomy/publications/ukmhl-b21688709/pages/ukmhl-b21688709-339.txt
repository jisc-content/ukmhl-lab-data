Topography. 71 410. Lateral View of the Male Pelvic Organs at Birth. Natural size. The Corpus cavernosum urethrae (Corpus spongiosum) encloses the urethra; at its posterior extremity it forms a rounded enlargement, the Bulbus urethrae (see Fig. 408), and at its anterior extremity the Glans penis, which overlaps the anterior rounded extremity of the Corpora caver- nosa penis. The fibrous tunic of the Corpus spongiosum is much thinner and the meshes between the trabeculae much smaller than those of the Corpora cavernosa penis. The Glans penis has at its sum m i t, Apex glandis, a vertical fissure forming the external orifice of the urethra; its base is formed by the Corona glandis, behind which lies a depression, the Cervix or Sulcus retro-glandular is. The Glans penis is surrounded by a duplicature of the skin, the prepuce, Praeputium; the covering of the glans is very thin and at the Meatus urinarius is continuous with the mucous membrane of the urethra. The prepuce is connected with the Glans penis by means of a fold, the Fracnulum praeputii. The Fascia penis, a continuation of the superficial fascia of the abdomen surrounds the body of the penis up to the Corona glandis; near the root of the organ there is in front a dense band of fibro-elastic tissue, named the suspensory ligament, Ligamcntum suspjensorium penis.

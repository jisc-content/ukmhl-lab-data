PREFACE sixteen years ago, â€žHeitzrn aim's Anatomischer Atlas" was first published. Since that time the work has been one of the princi- pal works on anatomy in use in German and Austrian universities, and more than 30.000 copies of it have been sold. As the work is now offered to the English reading medical public, it is by no means an exact translation from the German, and, especially in the second part, the text was often materially altered, in order to bring it more in unison with the leading English works, such as Gray and Q.uain. It will be noticed that a good many Latin words were allowed to remain in the figures, even where such words are not in general use in the English text books; wherever this was done, the corresponding English word was almost invariably added to the text, so that, even for those not well versed in Latin, there would be no difficulty in under- standing them. - With the exception only of those figures especially so men- tioned, the illustrations were all drawn on wood by the author, either from nature, or from preparations in the anatomical museum at Vienna, In its present, slightly altered form, it is hoped that the work will serve both as an aid to the medical student, and as a work of reference to the physician. Vienna, October 1886. Louis Heitzmann. a*

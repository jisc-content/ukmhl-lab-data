The thoracic duct, Ductus ihoracicus, is the principal trunk of the lymphatic system. It commences at the anterior surface of the II. or III. lumbar vertebra to the right and behind the aorta, by three roots, Radices ductus thoracici, the right and left of which are called Trunci lym/phatici lumbales, while the middle is called the Truncus lymphaticus mtestinalzs. The former commence from the lumbar plexuses, which collect the lymphatics of the pelvis and lower extremities; the latter forms the union of the lacteals of the alimentary canal. The place of union of these three roots is called Cisterna s. Receptaculum chyli. The thoracic duct ascends into the thorax with the aorta, and there lies between the aorta and V. azygos. Opposite the fourth dorsal vertebra it pas- ses to the left and behind the oesophagus, and at the level of the seventh cervical vertebra it turns outwards, at the same time arching downwards and forwards, to terminate at the angle of junction of the left common jugular and left subclavian veins. It receives the lym- phatics from the left and lower part of the right half of the thorax, also those from the left side of the head and neck and the left upper extremity, by means of the Truncus jugular is sinister and Truncus subclavius sinister. The lymphatics of the upper part of the right half of the thorax, as well as those from the right side of the head and neck and the right upper extremity, form the right lymphatic or thoracic duct, Ductus ihoracicus dexter, Avhieh opens into the right V. innominata.

14 Salivary Glands. 340. Lobules of the Parotid Gland, natural size. After a specimen of 11 g. The sublingual gland, Glandula sublingualis, rests on the upper surface of the mylo-hyoid muscle; its excretory ducts (eight to twelve), Ductus Bivini, open behind the Caruncula sublingualis, or join to form a common duct, the Ductus Bartholin!, which blends with Wharton's duct, or opens separately at the caruncula. The salivary glands are compound racemose glands; a number of acini form a lobule, which has a very small excretory duct; the small ducts unite to form larger ones, these again form the chief excretory duct. The tongue, Lingua (Fig. 341), is a muscular organ situated in the floor of the mouth; it has an upper surface or dorsum, an under surface, two. lateral borders, an apex or tip, a body, and a base or root. The upper convex surface contains numerous gustatory papillae, which are found a3 far back as the region of the isthmus of the fauces; from here to the hyoid bone there are mucous and follicular glands. On the under surface, which has no papillae, the mucous membrane forms a fold, the Fraemdum linguae; at the sides the Arcus pcdato-glossi are attached. The base or root of the tongue is attached to the hyoid bone; from it a middle and two lateral folds of mucous membrane, the glosso-epiglottic folds, Ligamenta glosso-epiglottica medium ct lateralia, pass to the epiglottis. The tongue is divided into two halves, by a fibrous septum, the Septum medianum linguae (see Fig. 329); at the tip of the lingual muscle the acinous Glandula Nuhnii s. Blandini about the size of a bean (see Fig. 339) is imbedded; its excretory ducts open at the Crista fimbriata, a fold of mucous membrane, which runs obliquely backwards and outwards.

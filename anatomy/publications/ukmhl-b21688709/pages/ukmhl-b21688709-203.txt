M. biceps brachii arises by two heads: The short head, Caput breve, in common with the M. coraco-brachialls from the coracoid process; the long head, Caput longum, from the upper margin of the glenoid cavity of the scapula. It is inserted into the tuberosity of the radius. From the tendon of insertion an aponeurotic band, Lacertus fibrosus (semilunar fascia), runs to the fascia of the humerus. (Supinates the pronated radius and flexes the forearm.) M. coraco-brachialls arises from the coracoid process and is inserted into the end of the Spina tuberculi minoris in the middle of the humerus. It is per- forated by the musculo-cutaneous nerve. (Draws the humerus forwards and inwards.)

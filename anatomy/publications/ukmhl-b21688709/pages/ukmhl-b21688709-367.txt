99 Cerebral Con volutions. 439. Cerebrum, from below. After E b erst all er. The cuneate lobule, Cuneus, is a wedge-shaped area lying between the calcarine and parieto-occipital fissures; the quadrate lobule, Prae- cuneus, is a four-sided area lying between the parieto-occipital and cal- loso-marginal fissures; the latter is imperfectly separated from the Gyrus fornicatus by the Sulcus subparietalis. The prolongation of the anterior cen- tral convolution on the median surface of the hemisphere, forms part of the paracentral lobule, Lobulus paracentralts. From the summit of the cuneus a deep convolution runs through the lower end of the parieto- occipital fissure to the Gyr. fornicatus (Fig. 438). On the under surface of the frontal lobe are only two fissures: 1. the olfactory fissure, Sulcus olfactorivs, in which the olfactory tract and bulb lie, 2. to the side of this is the orbital fissure, Sulcus orbitcdis, which varies a great deal. The orbital portion of the superior frontal convolution, Gyr. frontalis superior, is called the Gyr. rectus; the part between the orbital sulcus and Fossa Sylvii is the orbi- tal portion of the inferior frontal convolution (Fig. 436). On the under surface of the united temporal and occipital lobes a deep antero posterior sulcus, the occipitotemporal sulcus, separates a lateral from a median portion; the former lies between this sulcus and the third or inferior temporal sulcus and is called Gyr. occipito-temporalis lateralis s. fusiformis; the latter, Gyr. occipito-temporalis mcdialis, whose anterior portion is called Gyr. hippocampi, the posterior, Lobulus lingualis.

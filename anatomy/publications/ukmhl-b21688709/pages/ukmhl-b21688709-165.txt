Ankle-joint. 192. The Right Ankle-Joint, Articulatio pedis, from before, after removal of the anterior capsular wall. 193. The Articular Surfaces of the Right Tibia and Fibula, constituting the Ankle-Joint, seen from above.. On account of the size of the articular surface on the body of the astra- galus , a part of the anterior and posterior articular surfaces of that bone is, even in the median position of the joint, between flexion and extension, free from contact with the articular surface of the tibia. The tibia and fibula are articulated below by means of the anterior and posterior tibio-fibular ligaments, IAgamentum tibio-fibular-e anterius and posterius; between these are sac-like diverticula of the synovial membrane of the ankle-joint.

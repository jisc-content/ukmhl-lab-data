503. The Anterior Crural Nerve. 6. Anterior era r a 1, N. cruralis (ftmoralis), arises from the loop between the second, third and fourth lumbar nerves, and is the largest nerve of the lum- bar plexus. It passes be- tween the M. psoas and M. iliacus interims through the Lacuna muscularis to the thigh and divides into cu- taneous and muscular branches. The former are : a) The middle cu- taneous, N. cufaneus fe- moris medius, perforates the M. sartorius and passes to the middle of the anterior surface of the thigh. b) The internal c ut a- neous, N. cutaneus femoris interims, pierces the Fascia lata in the middle of the thigh, communicates with the anterior branch of the ob- turator nerve, and passes to the inner side of the thigh. c) The long or inter- nal saphenous, N. saphe- nous major, passes down with the femoral artery to the opening in the adductor tendon, and runs between M. vastus interims and M. adductor magnus to the in- ner side of the knee-joint. Behind the tendon of the sartorius it passes through the Fascia lata and accom- panies the internal saphe- nous vein down to the foot. It gives off the N. cutaneus surae internns to the calf of the leg, passes to the inner border of the foot, where it supplies the inte- gument and communicates with the internal branch of the musculo-cutaneous nerve.

Topography. 85 427. Topography of the Male Perinaeum. VI. View after removal of the M. levator ani. c) The MM. transversa perinei (see Fig. 425 and 426). The M. trans- versns perinei superficialis arises from the ascending ramus of the ischium, runs forwards and inwards, and unites with the corresponding muscle of the other side, as well as with the Sphincter ani extemus, the Accelerator urinae and the Levator ani. â€” The M. transversus perinei profundus (usually described as the hindmost fibres of the Compressor urethrae) lies above the superficial, arises from the ascending ramus of the ischium and the descending ramus of the pubes, and is united with the muscle of the other side and the following. In it Cowper's glands are imbedded. d) The M. constrictor s. compressor urethrae is a single muscle, which arises from the descending ramus of the pubes together with the M. trans- versus perinei profundus; it surrounds the membranous portion of the urethra, some of the fibres being in front of and others behind that portion. The M. transversus perinei profundus and the M. constrictor urethrae form together a broad, muscular plate, whose fibres cross each other in the median line, the Centrum carneo-tendinenm perinei s. Diaphragma urogenital.

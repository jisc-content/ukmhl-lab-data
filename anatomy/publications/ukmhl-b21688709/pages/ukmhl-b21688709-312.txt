Larynx. 44 375. The Laryngoscopic 376. The Laryngoscopic View in the Production View of the Posterior The vocal cords are situated one above the other, in the interior of the larynx, between the inner surfaces of the lamellae of the thyroid cartilage and the arytenoid cartilages. The superior or false vocal cords, or Ligamenta glottidis spuria, are two folds of mucous membrane, enclosing a delicate fibrous band of elastic tissue, the superior thyro-arytenoid ligament, attached to the anterior margin of the arytenoid cartilage and angle of the thyroid. The inferior or true vocal cords, or Ligamenta glottidis vera, are two fibrous bands of elastic tissue, the inferior thyro-arytenoid ligaments, covered by mucous membrane, and attached to the vocal process of the arytenoid cartilage and depression between the alae of the thyroid. The slit between the false vocal cords is called Glottis spuria, that between the true vocal cords Glottis vera; between the true and false vocal cords on each side is a depression, the Sinus s. Ventriculus Morgagni. The Mima glottidis between the true vocal cords has in quiet breathing a triangular shape, through which the anterior wall of the larynx (region of the thyroid cartilage, Lig. conicum, cricoid cartilage) and the trachea (tracheal cartilages) can be seen by means of the laryngo- scope ; by a corresponding position of the mirror, the posterior wall of the larynx (region between both arytenoid cartilages) and the trachea (Pars memhranacea) down to the place of bifurcation of the latter, can also be seen. At the moment of phonation the Eima glottidis is completely closed. Natural size. of Voice. cation. Natural size.

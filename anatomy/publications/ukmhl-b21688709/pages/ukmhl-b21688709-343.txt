75 Female Organs of Generation. 414. Diagram of a Graafian Follicle. The ovum is a small spherical body of about i/l2- of an inch in diameter, barely visible to the naked eye; it consists of the vitelline membrane or Zona pdlucida, the j o\\t,Vitdlus, and the germinal vesicle, Vesicida germinativa. The Zona pdlucida forms a transparent layer around the opaque yolk substance, which is composed of granules consisting of protagon and fat; the germinal vesicle forms the nucleus of the ovum and consists of a transparent, structureless membrane, containing a watery fluid, and an opaque spot, the germinal spot, Macula ger- minativa. The largest Graafian follicles usually lie near the surface of the ovary, where they may be seen projecting somewhat. At the time of menstruation the mature follicles burst, and the Liquor folliculi and ovum are liberated and pass into the Fallopian tube; after the discharge of its contents, the empty and collapsed Graafian follicle is filled with blood-tinged fluid, and in a short time its circumference is occupied by a firm reddish-yellow substance, the Corpus luteum; the former, cicatrized opening in the follicle is called Cicatrix. With the number of the menses the number of the cicatrices is also increased. Those Corpora lutea which remain after a menstruation, are called false, spuria; those remaining after the libe- ration of an impregnated ovum and after pregnancy: true, Corpora lutea vera. The Parovarium or organ of Rose n m ii 11 e r consists of from 15â€”20 closed tubes, and is situated in the broad ligament, Ala vesper tilionis, between the ovary and Fallopian tube. 10*

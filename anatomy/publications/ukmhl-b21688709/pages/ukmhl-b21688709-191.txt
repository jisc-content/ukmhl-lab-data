The fibrous sheath of the Rectus abdominis formed by the aponeuroses of the broad abdominal muscles, covers the whole of its anterior surface, while on its posterior surface it ends two or three fingers breadth below the umbilicus as Linea semicircidaris Douglasii (semi-lunar fold of Douglas) (see Fig. 219). M. pyramidalis abdominis arises from the upper border of the pubis and is inserted into the fibrous sheath (Vagina fibrosa) of the Rectus abdominis. 21*

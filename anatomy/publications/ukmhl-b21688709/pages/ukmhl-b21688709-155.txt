Knee-Joint. 127 B a sis Apex 175. The Eight Knee- Pan, Patella, from before. 176. The Right Knee- Pail, Patella, from behind. The patella has a base, an a p e x, an a n t e r i o r rough, and a posterior surface, which latter is divided into two articular facets, and moves along the groove between the two condyles of the femur. 177. The Semilunar Fibro-Cartilages, Fibrocartilagines inter articular es, seen from'above. The convex thickened border of each semilunar cartilage is turned toward the capsule, the concave thinned border toward the Eminentia intercondyloidea of the tuberosities of the tibia. The internal semilunar fibro-cartilage is less curved, and at its convex border thicker than the external (Fig. 178); the anterior extremities of these carti- lages are connected by means of a transverse ligament; these extremities are inserted in front, the posterior behind the Eminentia intercondyloidea.

86 Bones of the Upper Extremity, 107. The Right Humerus, Os humeri, from before. The humerus forms at its upper extremity the head, Caput humeri, covered with cartilage; the furrow below it is called the anatomi- cal neck, Colhtm anatomicum, while the surgical neck, Cottum ckirwrgicum,-lies at the place of insertion of the M. teres major (Fig. 109). Below the furrow the lesser tuberosity, Tuberculum minus, projects forwards, while the greater tuberosity, Tuherculum majus, projects outwards, being external to the lesser; between both runs the bicipital groove, Sulcus intcrtubercularis (for the tendon of the long head of the M. biceps). From the tuberosities the Spina tuberculi majoris and the Spina tuberculi minoris run downwards. At the external surface of the shaft or middle p i e c e, which has 3 surfaces, there is a rough triangu- lar impression, Tuberositas (place of insertion of the M. dcltoides); at the upper third of the inner border is the Foramen iiutritium. At the lower extremity of the humerus are: the trochlea, and the capitellum, Emincntia capitdta, the former for articulation with the ulna, the latter for articulation with the radius.

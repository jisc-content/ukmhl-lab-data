Cerebrum. 105 445. Horizontal Section of the Cerebrum, with a view of the Tela choroidea superior. 2/3 natural size. Between the two posterior pillars of the fornix, Crura posteriora fornicis, is a triangular portion, which is covered by the under surface of the Corpus callosum; this part of the Corpus caMosum is marked by transverse, longitudinal and oblique lines and is called Lyra Davidis or Psalterium. The posterior pillars of the fornix are continued on into the fimbria. The Tela choroidea superior or Velum interpositum is a prolongation of the pia mater; it is a vascular membrane and can be exposed to view after dividing the fornix and turning aside its two halves; it has small branches of the Art. profunda cerebri, and in its center two venous trunks, which flow backwards to the single Vena cerebri magna. In it are further found two vascular fringes, the choroid plexuses, Plexus choroidei, which at first lie together (Plexus choroideus medius), and then pass through the foramen of Monro into the lateral ventricles, Plexus choroidei laterales.

42 Larynx. d) The Cornicula laryngis or Cartilagines Santorinianae are articulated with the summits of the arytenoid cartilages, and e) the cuneiform cartilages or Cartilagines Wrisbergii are placed in the fold of mucous membrane which extends from the apex of the arytenoid cartilages to the sides of the epiglottis. f) The epiglottis; its upper, free border looks upwards and backwards (see Fig. 377), its attached end (Petiolus) is long and narrow and connected to the thyroid cartilage by means of the Idgamtntum iJiyreo- cpiglotticum. Its anterior surface is curved forwards towards the tongue; its posterior surface concave from side to side, concavo-convex from above downwards; the convexity projecting backwards into the larynx is named the tubercle. The true ligaments (extrinsic and intrinsic) of the larynx are: a) Middle thyro-hyoid, Ligamentwm thyreo-hyoideum medium (also called Membrana obturatoria laryngis), between the hyoid bone and superior border of the thyroid cartilage, and the two lateral thyro- ll y o i d, Ligamcnta thyreo-Jiyoidea-lateralia, between the superior cornua of the thyroid cartilage and the great cornua of the hyoid bone; the latter are two rounded yellowish cords and frequently enclose a fibro-cartilaginous nodule, Corpusculwm triticeum (cartilago-triticea).

Female Organs of Generation. 80 The vulva or pudendum includes all the parts perceptible externally, viz: the Mons Veneris, Labia majora, Labia minora s. Nymphae, the Hymen and the Clitoris. The Labia majora extend from the Mons Veneris, which is covered with hair, downwards to the perinaeum, where they are connected by a transverse fold, the FraenvZum labiorum; the two points where they are united are called the anterior and posterior commissures; the elliptical interval between the Ljabia majora is called Bima pudendi. The space between the fracnulum and posterior commissure is named the Fossa navicularis. The Labia minora are situated within the Ljabia majora and extend from the clitoris down- wards to become lost one on each side of the orifice of the vagina; at the sides of the clitoris each labium divides into two folds, which surround the Glans clitoridis, the inferior folds forming the Fraenidum clitoridis, the superior uniting to form the Praeputium clitoridis. The space between the Labia minora from the clitoris to the entrance of the vagina, is called the vestibule, Vestibidum vaginae; along either side of the vesti- bule are two large oblong masses, consisting of a plexus of veins, the Bulbi vestibvM. The clitoris is a small elongated body corresponding to a diminutive penis, but differing in having no corpus spongiosum nor urethra connected with it below; it has two Corpora cavernosa, a Glaus which is imperforate, a double Fraenulum, a Praepvtiiun and two MM. ischio- cavcr'nosis, called MAI. crectorcs clitoridis. The female urethra does not perforate the clitoris, but opens in the vestibule, above the entrance of the vagina, with a rounded orifice, surrounded by a fold of mucous membrane. On each side of the commencement of the vagina the glands o f B a r t h 0- line open; these are analogous to Cowper's glands in the male.

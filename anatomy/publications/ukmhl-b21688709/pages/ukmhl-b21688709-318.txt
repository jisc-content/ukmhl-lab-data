Trachea. 50 Spia Jo ffis 386. The Windpipe, Trachea. The trachea extends from the lower part of the larynx, on a level with the fifth cervical vertebra, to opposite the third dorsal, where it divides into the two bronchi; in front and at the sides are a series of imperfect carti- laginous rings, Cartilagines tracheales, 16—20 in number, held together by a strong fibrous membrane; the posterior portion is membranous, and presents trans- verse muscular fibres of the unstriped variety. The right bronchus, Bronchus dexter, is more horizontal, shorter and wider than the left bronchus, Bronchus sinister; the former has 6—8, the latter 9—12 cartilages, similar to those of the trachea, The bronchi, upon entering the substance of the lungs, divide, the right into three, the left into two branches, these again into smaller branches, and so on; each of the smaller subdivisions enters a pulmonary lobule, and, again sub- dividing, ultimately terminates in the intercellular passages and air cells of which the lobule is composed.

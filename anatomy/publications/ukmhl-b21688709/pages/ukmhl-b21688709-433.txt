165 Spinal Nerves. 509. The Deep Branch of the External Plantar Nerve. b) The external plantar, JV. plantaris extemus, lies between MM. flexor brevis digitorum and flexor accessorius, and is divided into a superficial and a deep branch. The superficial separates into three digital branches, which supply the little and outer side of the fourth toes; this branch communicates with the internal plantar nerve. The deep or muscular branch accompanies the external plantar artery and supplies all the interossei (except those in the fourth meta- tarsal space), the two outer lumbricales, the Adductor potticis and the Transversus pedis muscles. 22*

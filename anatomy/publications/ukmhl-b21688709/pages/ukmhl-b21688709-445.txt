177 Heart. Carotissin. 519. The Heart and Large Vessels. View from behind, */2 natural size. Up to the fourth month of embryonic life the position of the heart is a vertical one; in the adult it is placed obliquely, the long axis of the heart forming with that of the body an angle of about 50Â°. The base of the heart is situated between the second and third left ribs and extends to the interspace between fourth and fifth right costal cartilages; its apex lies behind the anterior extremities of the left fifth and sixth ribs. The long axis of the heart is therefore placed obliquely from right to left from above downwards, and the base is further posterior than the apex.

155 Spinal Nerves. I N- SUPRA- SCAPULAR. N. AXILLAR. Of the twelve dorsal nerves, Nervi dor sales s. thoracici, the first passes out of the intervertebral fora- men between the first and second dorsal vertebrae, the twelfth between the last dorsal and first lum- bar. Immediately after their exit they divide into lar- ger, anterior, and smaller, posterior divisions. The posterior divisions di- vide into internal and exter- nal branches; both supply the muscles and skin of the back. The anterior di- visions, the intercostal nerves, Nervi intercostales, pass forwards in the inter- costal spaces, each giving off a lateral cutaneous b r a n c h, N. cutaneus pecto- ralis lateralis. The upper six lateral cutaneous branches divide again into anterior and posterior, Nervi cu- tanei laterales pectoris ante- riores et posteriores, the for- mer to the integument of the chest and mamma, the latter to the integument of the back. Afterhavinggiven off the lateral cutaneous branches, the intercostal nerves con- tinue their course forwards, supply the intercostal muscles, pierce the M. pectoralis major near the sternum, and are lost as anterior cuta- neous nerves of the chest, Nervi cutanei pectoris anterio- res, in the integument of the mamma and front of the chest. The anterior bran- ches of the six lower lateral cutaneous nerves pass to the anterior abdominal wall, the posterior to the skin of the back as Nervi cutanei laterales abdominis anteriores et posteriores.

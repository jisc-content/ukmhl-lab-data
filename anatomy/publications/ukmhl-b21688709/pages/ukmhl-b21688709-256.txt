Organ of Hearing. 228 308. The Auricle, Auricula. 309. The Muscles of the Auricle. Tbe pinna or auricle is formed by a layer of fibro-carti- lage; its external rim is called the helix, which commences as Spina helicis; to the inner side of the helix is the fossa of the helix or Fossa scaphoidea; inter- nal to that, the curved antihelix, the commencement of which is formed by two ridges, the Crura furcata. The deepest concavity of the pinna, surrounding the entrance to the external auditory meatus is called concha. In front of the concha, and projecting back- wards over the meatus is the t r a- gus; opposite it the an ti tra- gus; between both is a deep notch, the Incisura intertragica. Below the notch is the lobule, Lobulus auriculae, devoid of the firmness and elasticity of the rest of the pinna. The muscles of the auricle are: the M. attollens (levator) auri- culae, the M. attrahens auriculae and the MM. retrahentes auriculae. Between the projections of the car- tilage of the ear are: the M. helicis major, which arises from the Spina helicis, and is inserted into the an- terior border of the helix where it is about to curve backwards; the M. Jielicis minor at the commencement of the Spina helicis; the M. tragi- cus upon the anterior surface of the tragus; iheM. antitragicus from the lower end of the antihelix to the antitragus. The M. transversus auriculae lies at the convex posterior surface of the cartilage of the ear, between the tubercles of the concha and the fossa of the helix.

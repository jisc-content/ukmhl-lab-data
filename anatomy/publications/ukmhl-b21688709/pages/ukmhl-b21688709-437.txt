169 Sympathetic Nerves. 513. The Pelvic Plexuses of the Sympathetic Nerve in the female. The cervical plexuses surround the arteries of the neck and are called Plexus laryngeus, tliyreoideus inferior and vertebralis. The thoracic plexuses belong partly to the vascular system: Plexus cardiacus and aorticus, partly to the lungs and oesophagus: Plexus puhnonalis and oesopliageus. The abdominal and pelvic plexuses are: Solar plexus, Plexus epigastricus s. Solaris, the largest plexus, which supplies all the viscera in the abdominal cavity, situated behind the stomach and in front of the aorta and crura of the diaphragm; it receives both splanchnic nerves coming out of the thorax; the phrenic, suprarenal, renal, superior mesenteric, spermatic and inferior mesenteric plexuses; then the aortic, abdominal and inferior hypo- gastric plexuses out of which latter the uterine, vesical and cavernous plexuses are given off in the female. The branches and communications of the sympathetic nerve are evident from Fig. 511â€”514.

Membranes of the Brain and Spinal Cord. 93 433. The Processes of the Dura mater. The brain and spinal cord are covered by three membranes: the Dura mater (Meninx fibrosa), the Arachnoidea (Meninx serosa) and the Pia mater (Meninx vasculosa). The Dura ' mater forms the external covering; it is a thick and dense inelastic fibrous membrane, whose outer surface adheres closely to the inner surface of the boues, forming their internal periosteum. It sends numerous processes inwards, into the cavity of the skull, and is prolonged to the outer surface of the skull through the various foramina which exist at the base; its fibrous layer forms sheaths for the nerves which pass through these apertures. In certain situations in the skull, the fibrous layers of this membrane separate, to form sinuses for the passages of venous blood, Sinus durae matris. The Dura mater also sends inwards into the cavity of the skull three strong membranous processes, the Falx cerebri s. Processus falciformis 'major, the Falx cerebclli s. Processus falciformis minor, and the Tentorium cerebclli. 13*

Cerebellum. 113 454, The Cerebellum, view from above. Natural size. The superior peduncles of the cerebellum, Processus e cerebello ad testes (Processus cerebelli ad corpora quadrigcmina), pass from the hemispheres of the cerebellum to the Corpora quadrigemina; they form part of the lateral boundaries of the fourth ventricle. Between the con- verging crura of the superior peduncles, the anterior medullary velum or valve of Vieussens, Velum medullare anterius s. Valvula cerebelli, is stretched, covering the canal leading from the third to the fourth ventricle (see Fig. 453). At the upper surface, the two hemispheres of the cerebellum are connected by the superior vermiform process, Vermis superior, corresponding to whose anterior and posterior extremities are two notches, the Incisura marginalis anterior and posterior. The upper surface is separated from the lower by the deep Sulcus magnus Tiorizontalis. In each hemisphere there are: a) The antero-superior or square lobe, Lobus superior anterior s. quadrangular is, then b) The p o s t e r o - s u p e r i o r or semilunar lobe, Lobus supe- rior posterior s. semilunaris. The parallel gyri of the Vermis superior separate the following three structures: a) The central lobe, Lobulus centralis, which has a central portion and tWo alae; b) The Monticulus, whose highest point, Cacumcn, is continued posteriorly into the Declive; a) and b) as connections of the gyri of the anterior lobe ; c) The Folium cacuminis, situated in the Incisura marginalis posterior, connecting the posterior lobes.

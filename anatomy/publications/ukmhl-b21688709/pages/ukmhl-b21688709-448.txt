The r i g h t auricl e, Auricula dextra, occupies the right and anterior portion of the base of the organ. Its right or outer wall is the smallest, the left wall is formed by the Septum auricularum. At the posterior half of the septum is the Fossa ovalis, whose floor is thin and translucent; it is bounded above and at the sides by a prominent border, deficient below, the Annulus ovalis s. Ldmbus foraminis ovalis s. Isthmus Vieussenii (see Fig. 521). In the heart of the embryo, the Fossa ovalis is a foramen, Foramen ovale; the blood flowing from the inferior Vena cava into the right auricle, mostly arterial, is guided by a semilunar projection, the Eustachian valve, to the Foramen ovale, through which the greater part passes to the left auricle. The inferior Vena cava opens at the posterior wall of the right auricle, the superior Vena cava at the upper wall. The right Appendix auriculae projects forwards and to the left side, overlapping the root of the aorta. The under part of the right auricle is occupied by the auricular-ventricular orifice, which leads into the right ventricle.

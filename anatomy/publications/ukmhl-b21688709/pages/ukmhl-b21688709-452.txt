184 Arteria pulmonalis. Pulmo V.dextra Pulmo 526. Pulmonary Artery and Air Passages of a Child. lL natural size, after a specimen of Hyrtl. The pulmonary artery, Arteria pulmonalis, arises from the right ventricle; at the concavity of the aortic arch it divides into a right and a left branch. The right, longer branch passes behind the ascending aorta and superior Vena cava to the root of the right lung. The left, smaller branch passes in front of the descending aorta and left bronchus to the root of the left lung; it is connected with the concave portion of the aortic arch by means of a short, fibrous cord, which corresponds to the obsolete Ductus arteriosus Botalli of the embryo. In the root of the lung, the right and left pulmonary arteries, both lie in front of the bronchus and behind the veins. On the right side the bronchus is highest and the veins lowest, while on the left side the bronchus sinks to a level between the artery and veins.

Fibres of the Brain. 121 * See note, page 122. 465. The Fibres of the Tr uncus Cerebri,*' View from below. Natural size. The fibres of the posterior column of the cord are con- tinued partly into the restiform bodies, partly into the tegmentum; those of the lateral column are grouped into three bundles, of which the posterior helps to form the restiform body, while the middle forms the Funiculus teres, and together with the Cvus cerebelli ad cerebrum (ad Corpus quadrigemiiium) the base of the tegmentum, and the anterior becomes the pyramid. The anterior column is continued to form the olivary body, and, forming the Lemniscus, runs to the Corpus quadrigemiiium. Some of the diverging fibres end in the cerebral ganglia, while others pass through and receive additional fibres from them, and, as they emerge, radiate into the anterior, middle and posterior lobes of the hemi- spheres; these fibres are called Corona radiata. The commissural fibres or commissures connect the hemispheres with each other, different parts of the same hemisphere and the cerebellum with the cerebrum. Such commis- sures are: between the cerebral hemispheres the Corpus cattosum, the anterior and posterior commissures in the third ventricle; between the hemispheres of the cerebellum the Pons Varolii, and vermiform pro- cess; between cerebrum and cerebellum the Crura cerebelli ad Corpora quadri- gemina; between Corpus quadrigemiiium, tegmentum and optic thalamus the Brachium anticum et posticum of the Corpus quadrigemiiium.

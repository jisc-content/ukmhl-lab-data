Bones of the Cranium. 1 1 9. Ethmoid Bone, Os eth- 10. Ethmoid Bone; perpen moideum, from the outside. dicular plate. 11. Ethmoid Bone; inner surface of the labyrinth. The ethmoid bone is divided into: 1. cribriform plate, Lamina cribrosa; 2- perpendicular plate, Lamina peipendicularis; 3. and 4. the cellular lateral masses, the ethmoidal laby- rinths. The cribriform plate is divided into 2 halves by the Crista ethmoidalis, which, projecting upward, forms the Crista galli. The cribri- form plate is perforated by the Foramina cribrosa. From its under sur- face the perpendicular plate (Fig. 10), which forms the upper part of the bony Septum narium, decends. The labyrinth (Fig. ll) is divided into the ethmoidal cells, Cellulae ethmoidales (anterior, middle and posterior), which are closed externally by the Lamina ixqv/raeea (Os planum): internally they are limited by the superior and inferior ethmoidal turbinated bones, Concha ,ethmoidalis superior et inferior, between which lies the superior meatus of the nose, Meatus narium superior. From the anterior end of the inferior ethmoidal turbinated bone (middle turbinated bone), and from the lower walls of the anterior ethmoidal cells, there projects the thin, serrated unciform process, Processus uncinatus. The ethmoid bone articulates with 15 bones; with 4 cranial bones, the sphenoid, the 2 sphenoidal turbinated i. e. Ossicula Bertini, the frontal, and 11 bones of the face; the 2 nasal bones, 2 superior maxillary, 2 lachrymal, 2 palate, 2 inferior turbinated, and the vomer. 2*

89 Shoulder-Joint. 110. The Right Shoulder-Joint, Articulatio humeri. The s h o u 1 d e r - j o i n t is surrounded by a lax fibrous capsule, which is strengthened by the coraco-humeral or accessory and glenoid ligaments. The articulation is free on all sides, only at the superior circumference it is protected by the eoraco-acromial ligament which is spread like a bridge between the acromion and coracoid processes. The fibrous capsule, which stretches from the circumference of the glenoid cavity of the scapula to the anatomical neck of the humerus, covers the bicipital groove between both tuberosities, thereby changing it into a canal.

Carotis externa. 189 R.post R.ant. A.fransv. faciei. A.cervical descend 9ea The c o m m o m carotid, Ca- rotis communis, ascends to the upper margin of the thyroid cartilage with- out giving off any branches, and there divides into the external and internal, Carotis externa and interna. The external carotid is covered by the Platysma myoides, by the superficial layer of the cervical fascia and the facial vein, passes ^ into the substance of the parotid gland and behind the condyle of the lower jaw, and divides into two terminal branches: the temporal, Art. temporalis superficialis, and i n t e I'- ll a 1 maxillary, Art. maxillaris interna. From the anterior portion of the external carotid arise: a) The superior thyroid, Art. tliyreoidea superior, which curves downwards and forwards in an arched and tortuous manner to the thyroid gland. It gives off the superior laryngeal, Art. laryngea superior, which pierces the thyro-hyoid mem- brane and supplies the muscles, mucous membrane and glands of the larynx and epiglottis; also mus- cular branches. (See Fig. 532, 533. In Fig. 533 — the original was a dried specimen — the superior laryngeal artery appears as if pushed out of its position; it must be imagined as running in the Swims piriformis.) b) The lingual artery, Art. lingualis, arises opposite the great cornu of the hyoid bone, and passing between the M. hyo-glossus and M. constrictor pharyngis medius, reaches the tongue. Its branches are the hyoid, Ramus liyoideus; the Art. dorsalis linguae to the mucous mem- brane of the dorsum of the tongue; the sublingual, Art. sublingualis, to the floor of the mouth. The continuation of the lingual artery is called r a nine artery, Art. ranina or Art. profunda linguae (see Fig. 541). It communicates with the artery of the other side only by means of capillaries. 25* 531. Diagram of the Rami- fications of the External Carotid.

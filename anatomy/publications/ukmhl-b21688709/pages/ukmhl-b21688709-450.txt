182 Heart. 524. The Left Heart, laid open. The left auricle, Auricula sinistra, has opening into it tbe four pulmonary veins, two into the right and two into the left side. The direction of the Appendix auriculae is forwards and towards the right side, overlapping the root of the pulmonary artery. The right ventricle, Ventriculus dexter, is separated from the left by the Septum ventriculorum. The auriculo-ventricular opening is guarded by the tricuspid valve, Valvula tricuspidalis, which consists of three seg- ments or flaps, an anterior, a posterior and an internal, of which the anterior is the largest. These segments are connected by their bases to the auriculo- ventricular orifice, and by their sides with one another, their free margins and ventricular surfaces giving attachment to a number of Chordae tendineae. The arterial opening is at the left side of the base of the ventricle, and leads into the pulmonary artery; the conical prolongation from which it is given off is called Ccmus arteriosus (see Fig. 52l). The three semi- lunar valves at the orifice of the pulmonary artery are divided into an anterior, a right and a left; their Noduli Arantii are often very small.

Lymphatics; 266 619. The Deep Lymphatics of the Pelvis and Groin. From the inguinal glands the lymphatic trunks pass with the vessels into the pelvis, receive lymphatics from the anterior and lateral walls of the abdomen and form the external iliac plexus, which empties into the inferior lumbar glands. The hypogastric and middle sacral plexuses also empty into these glands. The hypo- gastric plexus is formed by branches, which accompany those of the hypogastric artery; the middle sacral plexus receives the lym- phatics of the posterior pelvic wall, of the sacral canal and the rectum.

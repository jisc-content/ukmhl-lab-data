Bones of the Cranium. 7 pterygoid. 5. Sphenoid Bone, Os sphenoideum, from before. Body. On the anterior surface are two irregular openings, which lead into the sphenoidal sinuses, and are separated from each other by the Crista sphenoidalis; this becomes elongated in front, forming the Rostrum sphenoidale. The pterygoid processes are formed of two plates, the exter- nal and internal pterygoid plates, Lamina ptenjgoidea externa et interna, separated behind by an intervening notch, the Fossa ptenjgoidea; the inner plate ends in the hamular process, Hamulus pterygoideus. Between both plates is the Incisura pterygoidea (Fig. 6). At the base of the pterygoid process is the Vidian canal, running in a horizontal direction, and from whose anterior opening the pterygo-palatine groove, Sulcus pterygopala- tine, passes in a downward course. The Ossicula Bertini or sphenoidal turbinated bones are triangular bones, partially covering the openings of the sphenoidal sinuses, which latter are situated on the anterior wall of the body of the sphenoid bone.

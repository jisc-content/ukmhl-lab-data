Ill Medulla Oblongata. 452, Pons Varolii and Medulla Oblongata, view from below. Natural size. The Medulla oblongata s. Bulbus medullae spinalis, is continuous below with the spinal cord, on a level with the lower margin of the Foramen magnum; on each side, separated by fissures, are three columns. In the middle line, separated by the anterior longitudinal fissure, Sulcus longitudinalis anterior, are the two pyramids, Pyramides; external to these, are the olivary bodies, Olivae, at their sides, the resti- f or ni bodies, Corpora restiformia, which, because they enter the hemi- spheres of the cerebellum, are also called the inferior peduncles of the cerebellum. In the anterior longitudinal fissure the decussation of both pyramids, Decussatio pyramidum, is visible. In the substance of the olive is a white Nucleus s. Corpus dentatum olivae, surrounded by a grey, serrated lamina (see Fig. 462). After removal of the Medulla oblongata (separation of the restiform bodies and loosening from the Pons Varolii) a complete view of the under surface of the cerebellum is obtained. The two hemispheres of the cerebellum are separated from each other by a deep fossa, the val- ley, Vallecula Reilii. In this fossa, the Medulla oblongata, just removed, was contained; the fossa ends posteriorly in the Incisura marginalis posterior.

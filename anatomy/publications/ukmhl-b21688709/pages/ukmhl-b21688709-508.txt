Veins. 240 589, The Veins of the Diploe, after removal of the outer table of the skull. After Breschet (Gray). The cerebral veins, Venae cerebrates, are the following: Supe- rior cerebral veins to the superior longitudinal sinus; Vena Galeni or great or deep cerebral vein to the straight sinus; inferior cerebral veins to the cavernous, superior petrosal and transverse sinu- ses ; superior cerebellar veins to the straight sinus and inferior cerebellar to the inferior petrosal, transvere and occipital sinuses. The meningeal veins open in the neighbouring sinuses. The veins of the Diploe empty partly into the sinuses of the dura mater, partly into the veins of the pericranium. The internal auditory veins are very small. The ophthalmic vein commences at the inner angle of the eye, passes backwards at the inner wall of the orbit to the sphenoidal fissure, and empties into the cavernous sinus. It is formed by the following veins: the frontal, V. sacci lacrymalis, V. glandulae lacrymaUs, Venae muscu- lares, Venae ciliares, V. centralis retinae and the inferior ophthalmic.

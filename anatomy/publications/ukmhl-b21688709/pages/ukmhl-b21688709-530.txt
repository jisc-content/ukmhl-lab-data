262 615. The Superficial Lymphatics of the Upper Extremity. The lymphatics of the uppei\ex- tremity, the thorax and shoulder, col- lect in the Plexus lymphaticus axillaris, with 8â€”12 axillary glands. This plexus forms the Truncus lymphaticus subclavius,which opens into the thora- cic duct of the corresponding side. The lymphatics of the upper extremity are partly superficial and partly deep. a) The superficial lym- ph a t i c s commence at the fingers; those from the palmar side ascend on the inner side of the forearm, those from the dorsal side at first on the outer side, then across the border of the ulna to the inner sur- face of the forearm. In the bend of the elbow are one or two Glan- dulae cubitales. The lymphatics pass some directly into the axilla, others with the cephalic vein to the space between M. ddtoides and M. pectoralis major. b) The deep lymphatics accompany the veins of the arm, but are less numerous than the superficial; they form a few cubital glands, Glandulae cubitales, and deep bra- chial glands, Glandulae brachiales profundae.

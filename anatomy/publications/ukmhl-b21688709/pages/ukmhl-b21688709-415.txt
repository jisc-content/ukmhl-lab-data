Spinal Nerves. 147 491. The Superficial Nerves of the Neck. 7. N. superficialis s. subcutaneus colli turns around the M. sterno-cleido- raastoideus from behind forwards, and divides into two branches, an ascending, N. subcutaneus colli medius, and a descending, N. subcutaneus colli inferior; the former accompanies the external jugular vein and communicates with the cer- vicofacial division of the facial nerve. Both supply integument and platysina. 8. Supraclavicular nerves, Nervi supraclaviculars, three or four in number, descend to the clavicle and supply the skin of the anterior thoracic and acromial regions. 9. Phrenic nerve, X. phrenicus (internal respiratory nerve of Bell), arises from the third and fourth cervical nerves, descends in front of the M. scalenus anticus to the chest, and communicates with the brachial plexus and the middle and inferior sympathetic ganglia. It enters the thorax between Vena innominata and subclavian artery and passes between the pericardium and pleura to the diaphragm, whose Pars costalis and Pars lumbalis it supplies. The posterior branches of the lower cervical nerves pass to the deep muscles and skin of the neck. Heitzmann, Atlas. II. 20

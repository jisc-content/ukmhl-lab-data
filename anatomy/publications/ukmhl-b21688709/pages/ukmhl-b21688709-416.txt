The brachial plexus is formed by the anterior branches of the four lower cervical nerves and the greater part of the first dorsal. The manner iu which the nerves are disposed in the plexus, is liable to a great deal of variation, the more frequent arrangement, however, is the following: the fifth and sixth cervical nerves join together to form an upper trunk, the eighth cervical and first dorsal unite to form a lower trunk, while the seventh cervical forms by itself a middle trunk. Soon after passing the outer border of the scaleni muscles, each trunk divides into an anterior and a posterior branch. The anterior branches of the upper and middle trunks unite together to form the upper or outer cord of the plexus; the anterior branch of the lower trunk forms by itself the lower or inner cord, and the posterior branches of all three trunks unite to form the middle or posterior cord. Sometimes the nerves blend so as to form only two principal trunks, from which the three cords are given off. The brachial plexus is divided into a supraclavicular and an infra- clavicular portion, Pars supra- et Pars infraclavicularis. The former lies in the Fossa supraclavicularis, and its branches, besides those for the MM. scaleni and M. longus colli, are the following:

Spinal Nerves. 146 Co 71 US XXX N SACR 5 Fit. termirt 490. The Lower xtremity of the Spinal Cord. After Fr. Arnold. The first cervical nerve emerges be- tween the occipital bone and atlas as sub- occipital nerve; the eighth through the intervertebral foramen between the seventh cervical and first dorsal vertebra. The anterior divisions of the cervical nerves pass in front of or between the bundles of the M. scalenus medius and M. levator scapulae, forwards and outwards; the four upper form the cervical plexus, Plexus cervicalis, the four lower with the greater portion of the first, dorsal, the brachial plexus, Plexus brachialis. â€” The poste- rior division of the first cervical nerve, the infraoccipital nerve, supplies the posterior straight and oblique muscles of the head, the M. biventer cervicis and M, complexus. The posterior division of the second cervical nerve supplies the muscles of the neck (with the exception of the trapezius), and passes as great occi- pital nerve, N. occipitalis magnus, to the skin at the back of the head. The branches of the cervical plexus are: 1. Three or four filaments to the upper cervical ganglion of the sympathetic nerve. 2. Filaments to the ganglion of the trunk of the pneumogastric, to the hypo- glossal and its branch, the Descendens noni, as Ansa hypoglossi, 3. Filaments to the spinal accessory nerve. 4. Branches for the following muscles: Sccdeni, Longus colli, Pectus capit. ant. major et minor and Levator scapidat. 5. N. occipitalis minor, which ascends along the posterior border of the sterno- cleido-mastoid muscle to the back of the head; it communicates with the great occi- pital nerve and deep auricular branch of the facial nerve. 6. N. auricidaris magnus, which emerges at about the middle of the posterior mar- gin of the M. sterno-cleido-mastoideus, ascends upon that muscle to the parotid gland, and divides into an auricular branch, P. aur'icidaris, and a mastoid branch, P. mastoideus.

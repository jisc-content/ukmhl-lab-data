Spinal Nerves. 160 N. 504. The Great Sciatic Nerve The museularbran- ches of the anterior cru- ral nerve supply the muscles on the front of the thigh, with the excep- tion of the adductors and gracilis. The five sacral nerves, Kervi sacral'es, are the largest of the spinal nerves, the coccy- geal nerve, however, the small est. The posterior divisions of these nerves pass through the posterior sacral foramina and Hiatus sacro-coccygeus, and unite to form the Plexus sacratis posterior, which supplies cutaneous branches to the sacral and coccygeal regions. The large, anterior di- visions pass through the anterior sacral foramina and the Foramen sacro- coccygeum, and form the Plexus sacro-coccygeus. The Plexus sacro-coc- cygeus divides into the Ple- xus ischiadicus, pudenda-Ms and coccygeus. The Plexus ischiadicus and pudendalis are usually classified un- der the name of the s a- cral plexus. The bran- ches of the Plexus ischia- dicus (of the sacral plexus with the exception of the pudic nerve and its bran- ches) within the pelvis, are muscular filaments supplying the M. pyri- formis and M. obturator interims. Outside of the pelvis the branches are following:

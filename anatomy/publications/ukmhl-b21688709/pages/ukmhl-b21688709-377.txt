Cerebrum. 109 450. Base of the Brain, view from below. 2/3 natural size. After separation of the tentorium from the pyramids of the petrous bones, and cutting through the origins of the cranial nerves, the Medulla oblongata and the vertebral arteries, the whole brain is taken out of the cranial cavity and turned about, and thereby the base of the brain is brought to view. Here are seen: a) The anterior perforated space, Substantia perforata anterior, which consists chiefly of grey matter; it is divided into a middle and two lateral spaces, which serve for the transmission of bloodvessels. In front of the lateral portions a pyramidal grey eminence, the Trigonium olfactorium lies; it is prolonged into the Nervus olfactorius. b) The optic commissure or Chiasma nervorum opticorum, is formed by the two optic tracts, Tractus optici, which wind across the under surface of the Pedunculi s. Crura cerebri; from the chiasma, the round optic nerves, Nervi optici, arise. 15*

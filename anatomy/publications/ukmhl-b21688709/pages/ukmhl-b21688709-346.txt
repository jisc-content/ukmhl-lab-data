Female Organs of Generation. 78 418. Section through a Virginal Vagina. View from behind; the Vagina dilated, to show the Columnae, and Rugae on its inner surface. The Fallopian tubes or oviducts, Tubae Fallopianae s. Ovi- ductus (see Fig. 412 and 415), commence at the superior angles of the uterus and pursue an modulatory course; they are inclosed in the free margin of the broad ligaments. The inner half is narrow and cord like, Isthmus, the outer half is enlarged and called Ampulla. The opening of the Fallopian tube into the uterus is called Ostium tubae uterinum. The external orifice, Ostium tubae abdominale, which lies in front of and below the ovary, and com- municates with the peritoneal cavity, is wide and trumpet-shaped, and its margins are surrounded by a series of fringelike processes, termed Fimbriae; to this part of the tube the term fimbriated extremity or Morsus diaboli is applied. One of these jjrocesses, Fimbria ovarica, is connected with the outer end of the ovary, and probably effects (by means of ciliated epithelium) the passage of the ovum from the ovary into the tube. The Fallopian tubes have three coats similar to the uterus. The vagina is a membranous canal, about 3 inches in length, which commences at the vulva with the Ostium vaginae, and ends above at the Fornix. The vaginal portion of the uterus extends into the fornix, thereby dividing it into an anterior, shallow, and a posterior, deeper part.

158 Fascia of the Neck. 212, The Cervical Fascia. Superficial Layer. The superficial layer of the cervical fascia (below the Platysma myoidesj covers the MM. sterno-cleido-mast., sterno-hyoid., sterno-thyreoid., thyreo- hyoid. and the anterior belly of the Omo-hyoid., is continued superiorly into the Fascia parotidto-raasseterica, and is attached above to the lower border of the lower jaw, and below to the Manubrium, sterni and Lig. interclaviculare. The deep layer (Fig. 213) forms the floor of the Trig, inframaxill. and supraclavicul., covers the postei'ior belly of the Omo-hyoideus, forms sheaths for the large vessels (the Nerv. vagus has no separate sheath) and divides into two layers. One forms the prevertebral fascia behind the pharynx and oesophagus; the other extends in front of the thyroid gland and the trachea to the median line, and at the root of the neck may be traced over the large vessels, to be continuous with the fibrous layer of the pericardium.

The two posterior columns of the cord, which bound the posterior median fissure, are continued upwards and forwards, to reach the hemi- spheres of the cerebellum as rest iform bodies, Corpora restiformia; where they'enter the hemispheres, they show in section a grey nucleus, the Tuberculum cine.re.um. The posterior median fissure, Sulcus longitudinal posterior, diverges on each side to an angle, which is open in front, and forms with the angle of the Processus cercbelli ad corpus quadrige- minurn, the boundary line of the Fovea s. Fossa rhomboidea, the floor of the fourth ventricle. The grey basal surface of the Fovea rhomboidea is called Lamina cinerea foveae rhomboideae; it is divided by a median fur- row into two halves. Where the restiform bodies begin to diverge, two narrow white cords, the Funiculi gracilcs are placed between them; these broaden out at the posterior angle of the Fovea rhomboidea into an expansion, the Clava. That part of the restiform bodies lying just outside to the Funiculi graciles, is called the Funiculus cuneatus. At both sides of the median raphe of the Fovea rhomboidea are the Funiculi teretes; these are covered posteriorly by the grey Alae cinereae. Heitzmann, Atlas. II. 16

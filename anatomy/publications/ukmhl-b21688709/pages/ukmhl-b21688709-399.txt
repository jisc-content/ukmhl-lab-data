131 Cranial Nerves. 475. The Spheno-Palatine Ganglion, The largest ganglion of the trigeminal nerve is the Gasserian or semilunar g a n g 1 i o n, Ganglion Gasseri (see Fig. 47 l), somewhat crescentie in shape and formed only by the posterior sensory root of the fifth nerve. The ophthalmic, lenticular or ciliary ganglion, Gang- lion ciliare (see Fig. 469 and 470), about the size of a pin's head, is situated in the orbit between the external rectus muscle and the optic- nerve. Its roots are: the short root, Radix hrevis (motor) derived from the oculomotor nerve; the long root, Radix longa (sensory) derived from the nasal nerve, and the sympathetic root, Radix sympathica, from the carotid plexus. From the ciliary ganglion 10â€”1(3 ciliary nerves arise; they are disposed in two bundles, which pierce the sclerotic, pass between the latter and the choroid to the ciliary muscle, and supply this muscle, the iris and cornea. The s p h en o - p a 1 a t i n e or Meckel's ganglion, Ganglion xplicno-palatinum s. pterygo-palatinum (Meckelii), is deeply placed in the spheuo-maxillary fossa close to the spheno-palatine foramen, and is connected by a few short filaments (Nervi sphcno-palatini) with the II. division of the trigeminus. Its branches are: a) The ascending or orbital branches, Ramidi orbitales, which enter the orbit by the spheno-maxillary fissure, and supply the periosteum. H e i t z id a n ii, Atlas. II. IS

Muscles of the Pharynx. 19 347. The Muscles of the Pharynx, from behind, after removal of the Vertebral Column. The longitudinal muscles of the pharynx are: the two M. stylo- pharyngei, and the single M. azygos pharyngis, which latter is often wanting. The constrictor muscles of the pharynx, Constrictores pharyngis, form the lateral and posterior walls of the pharynx, and are all inserted into the fibrous raphe in the posterior median line. They form three pairs: The M. constrictor superior arises from the hamular process of the pterygoid plate of the sphenoid (Pterygo-pharyngeus), from the mylo- hyoidean line of the lower jaw (Mylo-pharyngeus), from the side of the tongue (Glosso-pharyngeus) and from the Fascia bucco-pharyngea (Bucco- pharyngeus). The M. constrictor medius arises from the greater cornu of the hyoid bone (Cerato-pharyngeus), and from the lesser cornu (Chondro-pharyngcus). The M. constrictor inferior arises from the outer surface of the thyroid cartilage (Thyreo-pharyngeus) and the cricoid cartilage (Crico-pharyngeus). The constrictors are so arranged, that the inferior partially covers the middle and the middle the superior. 3*

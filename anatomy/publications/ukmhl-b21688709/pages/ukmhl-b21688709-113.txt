Acromioclavicular Articulation. 85 106. The Right Acromio-Clavicular Articulation, Articulatio acromio-clavicularis. The fibrous capsule of this articulation is strengthened by the Liga- mentum acromio - claviculare; in the articular cavity there is an inter- articular f i b r o - c a r t i 1 a g e developed in different degrees. The clavicle is articulated with the coracoid process by the strong coraco - clavicular ligament, whose internal triangular portion is called conoid ligament, Ligamentum conicum, and its external quadrilateral portion, trapezoid ligament, Ligamentum trapezoides. Between the acromion and coracoid processes there is a fibrous band, the strong coraco-acromial ligament. The Incisura semilunaris (supra- scapular notch) at the superior border of the scapula is converted by a transverse ligament, Ligamentum transversum, into a foramen (for the passage of the suprascapular nerve).

The Eustachian tube, Tuba Eustachii, commences at the anterior wall of the tympanic cavity, below the Semicanalis tensoris tympani with the Ostium tympanicum, runs obliquely forwards, inwards and downwards, and terminates at the side of the pharynx, with the Ostium pharyngeum. The tube consists of an osseous and a cartilaginous portion.

The handle or Manubrium is connected with the Membrana tympani; the short process, Processus brevis, is situated at the root of the handle and projects outwards toward the Membrana tympani; the long process, Processus Folii seu gracilis lies in the Fissura Glaseri.

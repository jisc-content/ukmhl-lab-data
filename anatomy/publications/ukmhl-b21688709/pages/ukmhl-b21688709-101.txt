Articulations of the Ribs. 73 Ziicf. intcr- articularc 03. Articulations between the Posterior Ends of the Ribs and the Vertebrae, Articulationes costo-spinales, anterior view. Between the heads of the ribs and the articular fossae of the vertebral bodies are articulations, Articulationes costo-vertebrales, surrounded by a capsule, and covered by the Ligamentum eapituli costae anterius (anterior costo-vertebral). AVhen the head of the rib has two articular facets (second to tenth ribs), the articular cavity is divided by the Ligamentum interartieidare (continuation of the intervertebral disc to the Crista eapituli) into two parts. The articular cavity of the eleventh and twelfth ribs is always single, that of the first rib usually single; sometimes, when the articular fossa is formed by the seventh cervical and first dorsal vertebrae, double, divided by a Ligamentum interartieidare.

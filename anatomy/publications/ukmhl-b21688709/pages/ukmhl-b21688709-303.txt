35 Liver. 3(55. Diagram of the Structure of the Liver. Segment of an hepatic lobule. The liver is composed of a multitude of small lobules which are not completely insulated, being confluent in a part of their extent. The- interlobular branches of the hepatic artery and of the portal vein ramify between the lobules (the former probably transmit no blood directly to the capillary network of the lobules); these vessels collectively are called Vasa interlobularia. The hepatic veins commence in the center of each lobule as intralobular or central veins, Vasa intralobularia s. Venae centrales. The Vasa inter- and intralobularia are connected with each other by a capillary network, in the interstices of which are the hepatic cells. Between the hepatic cells are the commencements of the biliary vessels, which unite to form the biliary ducts, Ductus biliarii; these biliary ducts accompany the Vasa interlobularia. 5*

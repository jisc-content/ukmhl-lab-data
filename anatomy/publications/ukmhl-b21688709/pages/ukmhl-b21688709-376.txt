108 Cerebrum. 449. Lateral View of the Pons Varolii and the Medulla Oblongata. Natural size. The Corpora quadrigemina are situated immediately behind the third ventricle and posterior commissure; they are two pairs of rounded emi- nences, the anterior, larger, being called the nates, the posterior, smaller, the testes. Laterally the eminences are prolonged into prominent white tracts, the Braclua corporis quadrigcmini, of which the Brachia anteriora on both sides are connected with the Corpus gcniculatum anticum, and enter the optic thai ami, and the Brachia postcriora with the Corpus genicidatum posticum, and partly reach the optic thalami, partly the tegmentum. The pineal gland, Glandula pinealis s. Penis cerebri s. Conariurn, consisting mostly of grey matter, lies upon the anterior eminences of the Corpus quadrigcminum, the nates; it sometimes contains the Ventriculus conarii. The peduncles, Pedunculi conarii, arise from the anterior extremity of the pineal gland; they pass forwards and downwards upon the inner margin of the optic thalami, to the anterior pillars of the fornix, as Taeniae medullares (see Fig. 448). Above the Corpora quadrigemina is the Splenium corporis callosi (see Fig. 447), and between the two, the transverse fissure of the cerebrum; through this fissure the pia mater passes inwards into the third ventricle, as Tela clioroidea media; the fissure is prolonged along the Pes hippocampi major (Comu ammonis) to the base of the lower cornu and contains a continuation of the pia mater to the Plexus choroidals lateralis.

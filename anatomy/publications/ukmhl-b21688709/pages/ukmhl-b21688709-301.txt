Liver. 33 362. The Peritoneal Ligaments of the Liver of a Child several weeks old. The peritoneal folds of the liver are further: a) between the liver and the lesser curvature of the stomach the Ligamcntum licpato-gastricum s. Omentum minus; b) between the liver and duodenum the Ligamcntum hepato-duodenale; c) between the liver and upper part of the right kidney the Liga- mcntum licpato-renale; d) between the liver and colon the Ligamcntum hepato-colicum; the two latter ligaments are not always well developed. Between the Ligamcntum hepato-duodenale and Ligamcntum duodeno- renalc is the oval Foramen Winslowii, through which a finger or probe will pass into a space behind the stomach and lesser omentum, which space is called Saccus peritonei retroventricularis s. Bursa omcntalis. The round ligament is a fibrous cord resulting from the obliteration of the umbilical vein; the Ductus venosus Arantii, also obliterates after birth, is in the foetus a continuation of the umbilical vein, and joins the left hepatic vein at the point of junction of that vessel with the inferior Vena cava.

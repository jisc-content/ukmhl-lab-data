232 Topography. The external cir- cumflex artery passes outwards, behind the AT. rec- tus femoris, supplies the muscles in front and on the outer side of the thigh, sends the Ramus musculo- articularis down to the knee and finally perforates the M. vastus externus. The p e r- f orating arteries of the profunda femoris, Arteriae perforantes (see Fig. 578), pass through the tendons of the adductors to the posterior side of the thigh; they are three in number, the termination of the pro- funda femoris being the fourth. 5. Muscular bran- ches, Rami muscidares, for the muscles of the thigh. 6. Art. superficialis genu (anastomotica magna) passes to the internal condyle of the femur and anastomoses with the superior internal articular branch of the popli- teal artery. The popliteal artery gives off muscular and articular branches. The latter, which form the Rete articulare genu, are the following: The superior articular, Arteriae articulares genu supe.riores, a larger external and a smaller internal; The inferior articular, Arteriae articulares genu inferiores, also an external and an internal; The middle or a z y g o s articular, Art. articulationis genu media, for the internal ligaments of the knee-joint. The two superior and two inferior lie close to the bone, the middle pierces the popliteal ligament and the posterior capsular wall, and passes into the cavity of the knee-joint.

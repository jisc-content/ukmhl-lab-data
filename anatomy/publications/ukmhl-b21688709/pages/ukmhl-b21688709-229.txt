Muscles of the Lower Extremity. 201 Deep Layer: M. popliteus arises from the external con- dyle of the femur and the external inter- articular fibro-cartilage of the knee-joint; it is inserted into the inner border of the tibia. (Flexes the leg and rotates it inwards.) M. tibialis posticus arises from the posterior surface of the tibia, the interosseous mem- brane and from the inner surface of the fibula; it is inserted into the tuberosity of the scaphoid bone (Fig. 276, 277). (Extends the tarsus and raises the inner border of the foot.) M. flexor digitorum communis longus s. per- forans. Origin of the long head: posterior surface of the tibia; of the short head, usually called M. flexor accessorius: from the under and inner surface of the Os calcis (Fig. 275). Insert.: By four tendons from which arise the M. lumbricales, into the III. phalanges of the four outer toes; oppo- site the I. phalanges these tendons perforate the corresponding tendons of the M. flexor digit, comm. brevis. M. flexor hallucis (pollicis) longus arises from the lower two-thirds of the posterior surface of the fibula, and is inserted into the II. phalanx of the great toe (Fig. 274). Heitzmann, Atlas. I.

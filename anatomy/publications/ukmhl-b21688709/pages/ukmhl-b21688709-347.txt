The External Female Organs of Generation. The Labia majora and minora pressed apart. The anterior and posterior walls of the vagina are in contact with each other; the uppermost part of the posterior wall is invested hy peritoneum. The walls of the vagina are composed of connective tissue, which contains a dense layer of smooth muscle fibres and a venous net- work. The mucous membrane of the vagina is provided with numerous papillae; its inner surface presents anteriorly and posteriorly a slightly elevated ridge, forming the columns of the vagina, Columna plicartim anterior et posterior, which gradually become less marked at its upper end (see Fig. 418). At the orifice of the vagina the mucous membrane forms, in the virginal state, a duplicative, the hymen, which usually appears semi- lunar, with an upper opening, but sometimes circular, perforated at the upper margin (Hymen annularis) or pierced with several small apertures (Hymen cribriformis), or (rarely) may be fimbriated (Hymen fimbriatus), (see Fig. 412)- After rupture of the hymen, Defloratio, small rounded elevations, the Carunculae myrtiformes, remain.

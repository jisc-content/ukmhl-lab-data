65 Topography, 404. Sagittal Median Section through the Male Pelvis, the Penis being erect. (Construed out of Fig. 400-) The male urethra, 6â€”7 inches long, extends from the neck of the bladder (Orificium vesicale), to the Meatus urinarius (Orificium cutaneum); in the erect state of the penis it forms only a single curve, but in the flaccid state a double curve. It is divided into the prostatic portion, Pars prostatica, membranous portion, Pars memhranacea (Isthmus) and the spongy portion, Pars cavernosa. Along the floor of the prostatic portion is a narrow, longitudinal ridge, the Caput gallinaginis s. Colliculus seminalis, formed by an elevation of the mucous mem- brane; at the fore part of the Caput gallinaginis is the Vesicula prostatica, (Sinus pocularis), and upon or within its margins are the slit-like openings of the ejaculatory ducts; on each side of the caput are the orifices of the prostatic ducts. The membranous portion is the narrowest part of the urethra, surrounded neither by the prostate nor by the Corpus cavernosum. The spongy portion is surrounded by the Corpus spongiosum (Corpus caver- nosum urethrae), which is situated in the groove on the under surface of the Corpora cavernosa penis; at its commencement, the Corpus spongiosum forms a rounded enlargement, the bulb, Bulbus urethrae, therefore the part of the urethra contained within the bulb, which is somewhat dilated, is called Bulbous portion, Pars Lulbosa; here the excretory ducts of Cowper's glands open. The lining membrane of the urethra is beset with small glands and follicles, and larger recesses or Lacunae Morgagni, especially abundant in the bulbous portion, At the glans penis the urethra is again dilated, forming the Fossa navicular is.

Bones of the Face. 33 40. Inferior Maxillary Bone, Maxilla inferior, from the inside. Body. In the middle of its inner (posterior) surface is a promi- nent one- or two-pointed tubercle, the Spina mentalis interna (genial tubercle); beneath this are 2 rough impressions each for the origin of the anterior belly of one of the digastric muscles. Externally to the tubercle, the internal oblique line, Linea obliqua interna sen mylo-hyoidea, commences. In the alveoli of the upper border there are on each side 2 incisor teeth, (D. incisivi), 1 canine tooth (D. caninus), 2 bicuspid teeth (D. buccales), and 3 molar teeth (t). molares), whose last is also called the wisdom tooth. Rami. Eacb ramus shows in the middle of its inner surface the Lingula, behind which lies the inferior dental foramen, s. Foramen maxillare internum, forming the beginning of a canal, the inferior dental canal, Canalis alveolaris inferior, which runs through the substance of the body and ends at the mental foramen. From the Foramen maxillare inter- num a groove, the mylo-hyoidean groove, Sulcus mylo-hyoideus, runs obliquely downwaids. The inferior maxilla articulates with the glenoid fossae of both tem- poral bones. Heitzmann, Atlas. I. 5

Arteria subclavia. 201 545. Course and Ramification of the Right Sub- clavian Artery. The subclavian artery, Art. subclavia, arises on the right side from the innominate artery, on the left from the arch of the aorta, passes a short way up into the neck, arches outwards over the pleura and lung, and rests between the anterior and middle scaleni muscles on the first rib. At the outer border of the first rib it assumes the name of axillary artery. Its five branches are the following: 1. The vertebral artery, Art. vertebralis, enters the foramen in the transverse process of the sixth cervical vertebra, and ascends through the foramina in the transverse processes of all the vertebrae above this. Above the upper border of the axis it inclines outwards and upwards to the foramen in the transverse process of the atlas, through which it passes; then it winds backwards and finally enters the skull through the Foramen magnum. At the lower border of the Pons Varolii it unites with the vessel of the opposite side to form the single basilar artery. â€” Up to its entrance into the cranium it gives off muscular branches, spinal br an c h e s and the posterior meningeal artery. After its entrance it gives off: the anterior and posterior spinal, the two anterior of which unite to form a common trunk; then the posterior inferior cerebellar to the posterior portion of the cerebellum; finally the anterior inferior cerebellar to the anterior portion of the inferior cerebellar region. The basilar artery, Art. basilaris, formed by the junction of the two vertebral arteries, extends from the posterior to the anterior border of the Pons Varolii, where it divides into two branches, the right and left posterior cerebral or Art. profunda cerebri dextra et sinistra.

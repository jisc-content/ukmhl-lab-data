10 Bones of the Cranium. 8. Frontal Bone, Os front is, from behind. Frontal portion. The inner surface is divided by the frontal crest, Crista frontalis, into 2 halves; on both sides are Pacchionian depressions. The border of the frontal portion, Margo coronalis, commences behind the zygomatic process with a triangular, serrated surface. The two orbital portions are separated from each other by the ethmoidal notch, Incisurd ethmoidalis; on the inferior surface close to the zygomatic rjrocess is the lachrymal fossa, Fovea glandidae lacrymalis; toward the nasal portion a depression, Foveola troehlearis, sometimes the Hamulus trocldcaris (for the pulley of the superior oblique muscle of the eye). The inner border is broad and cellular, the compartments leading to the frontal sinuses, Sinus frontal.es; between the outer edge of the inner border and the contiguous Lamina papyrucea of the ethmoid bone are the anterior and posterior ethmoidal foramina, Foramen ethmoidale antcrius et For. ethm. posterius; the latter sometimes formed only by the frontal bone. On the nasal portion behind the superior nasal spine is the Foramen coecum (for a vein) ; , above it the Incisura nasalis. The frontal bone articulates with 12 bones; with the 2 parietal, the sphenoid, the ethmoid bones; witli the 2 nasal, the 2 superior maxillary, the 2 lachrymal and the 2 malar bones.

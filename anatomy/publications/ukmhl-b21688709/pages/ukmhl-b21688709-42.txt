14 Bones of the Cranium. 14. Left Temporal Bone, Os temporum, from the outside. The temporal hone is divided into 3 parts: 1. tk squamous portion, Pais squamosa s. Squama, 2. the petrous portion, Pars pttrosa, and 3- the mastoid portion, Pars mastoidea. The squamous portion has on the outer surface in front and above the Meatus auditorius externus, the zygomatic process, Processus zygomaticus, formed by 2 roots; between the roots the glenoid fossa, Fossa glenoidalis (for the condyle of the inferior maxilla) ; in front of this, the Eminentia articidaris or Tuberculum articularc. The furrow for the temporal artery is not constant. The mastoid portion shows on the outer surface the mastoid process, Proc&ssxis mastoldeus, which is grooved from below by the Incisura mastoidea, and is limited at the posterior periphery of the external auditory meatus by the Fissura tympamo-mastoidta (in this the end orifice of the Canaliculus mastoidms). The borders are: the superior, strongly serrated, for articulation with the Angulus mastoidms of the parietal bone, and the posterior, slightly serrated for articulation with the inferior portion of the lateral border of the occipital bone.

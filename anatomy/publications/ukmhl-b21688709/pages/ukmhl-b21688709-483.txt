Aorta thoracica. 215 561. Course and Ramification of the Descending Thoracic Aorta. The origins from the posterior part of the aorta of each two of the intercostal arteries, are nearer to each other, the lower these arteries are placed. Several intercostal arteries may arise from a common trunk, which descends in front of the heads of the ribs. The artery which runs at the lower border of the twelfth rib, should, according to Haller, be more correctly called the first lumbar, Art. lumbalis prima. The upper intercostal arteries frequently arise lower than the position of the intercostal spaces to which they belong.

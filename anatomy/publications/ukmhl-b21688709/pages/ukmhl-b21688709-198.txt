Muscles of the Back. 170 224. The Long- Muscles of the Back. M. erector trunci seu spinae. Orig.: Posterior surface of the sacrum, tuber- osity, and posterior portion of the crest of the ilium, spinous processes of the lumbar vertebrae. Opposite the last rib this muscle divides into the: a) M. saerolumbalis which is at- tached by twelve tendinous slips into the twelve ribs; from the six or seven lower ribs accessory bundles arise (M. accessorins ad sacro-lumbalem). The analogous bundles of the five or six irpper ribs unite to form the M. cervi- calis ascendens, which is inserted into the transverse processes of the 6.â€”4. cer- vical vertebrae. b) M. longissimus dorsi which is attached by ten tendinous slips at the tubercles of the ribs (except the I. and XII.) and the transverse processes of the dorsal vertebrae. Its continuation is the M. transversalis ceroids; this muscles arises from the transverse pro- cesses of the four upper dorsal and two lower cervical vertebrae, and is inserted into the transverse processes of the five upper cervical vertebrae. (Acting on both sides they extend the spinal column, acting on one side they produce lateral flexion and rotation of the column.) MM. levatores costarum (Fig. 225). Orig.: Transverse processes of the 7. cervical to the XI. dorsal vertebrae. Insert.: Each to the rib below. At the lower ribs are the Levatores costarum longi, which are inserted in the second rib below their origin. M. biventer ccrvicis. Orig.: By three or four tendinous slips from the trans- verse processes of the upper dorsal vertebrae; the middle of the muscle is tendinous; above the 6. cervical vertebra it again becomes fleshy (Inscriptio ten- dimea) and is inserted below the superior curved line of the occipital bone.

Bones of the Cranium. 5 3. Occipital'Bone, Os occipitis, from below. 3. and 4- Condyloid portions. On the upper surface (Fig. l) the Processus anonymus; on the lower surface both condyloid processes for articulation with the atlas; behind these the flat condyloid fossae. In front of the condyloid process lies the anterior condyloid foramen (a short canal for the XII. pair of cranial nerves). The posterior condyloid foramen is not always present (for an Emissarium Santorim). The inner border of the condyloid portions forms the lateral border of the Foramen magnum; the outer border shows the jugular notch, Incisura jugularis, and at its posterior end the jugular process. The upper surface of the process presents a groove (for the lateral sinus of the Dura mater). The occipital bone articulates with G bones: with the 2 parietal bones, the 2 temporal bones, with the sphenoid bone and with the first cervical vertebra (atlas).

68 Male Organs of Generation. 407. a. b. c. Diagrammatic View of tlie Descensus testiculi. The testis is developed in the embryo in the abdominal cavity, and is covered by peritoneum, with the exception of the posterior wall where the Vas deferens and the bloodvessels enter and leave; it is supported in its passage from the abdomen into the scrotum by a duplicature of the peritoneum, called the Mesorchivm. In the mesorchium a conical-shaped cord, the Gubcrnaculum testis s. Hunteri, is attached to the testicle and the bottom of the scrotum; it is surrounded by striped muscular fibres and is divided below into three processes. By a shortening of this cord the testicle gradually passes through the inguinal canal into the scrotum, a small pouch of peritoneum preceding the testis in its course through the canal; this pouch is called Processus vaginalis peritonei; the blood- vessels and Vas deferens are not contained in it. The cavity of the Processus vaginalis closes after birth from the inguinal canal towards the testicle, and only a thin connective tissue cord, called the Ligula, remains; at the testicle and a part of the epididymis the cavity remains pervious, and the serous covering, which entirely surrounds the testicle constitutes the Tunica vaginalis propria testis. The spermatic cord, Funiculus spermatious, is the bundle of vessels and nerves, which supports the testicle, and is invested, as is also the testis, by the Tunica vaginalis communis; this is a continuation of the Fascia transversa abdominis and is also called i n f u n d i b u 1 i f o r m fas c i a ; on its outer surface the bundles of the ere master muscle lie.

66 Male Organs of Generation. 405. The Right Testicle and Epididymis, natural size. The two testicles, Testiculi, the glands producing the semen, are suspended in the scrotum by the spermatic cords. Each testis has an ovoid form; its upper end is directed forwards and outwards, its lower end backwards and inwards. The Tunica albuginea s. propria surrounds the glandular structure of the testicle, and, at its posterior and upper border is reflected into the interior of the gland, forming an incomplete vertical septum called the Mediastinum testis s. Corpus Higlvmori. From this septum numerous slender fibrous cords are given off, which pass to be attached to the inner surface of the Tunica albuginea; they join with similar cords given off from the Tunica albuginea to form spaces which enclose the separate lobules of the testis. Each lobule consists of from 2—5 convoluted tubes, the Tubuli seminiferi; as these approach the Corpus Highmori they unite with one another and finally form the Eetc Halleri; from this rete, 12—19 stronger tubules, the Vasa efferentla, arise, which perforate the Tunica albuginea, beneath the Globus major of the epididymis, in the convoluted canal of which they ultimately terminate.

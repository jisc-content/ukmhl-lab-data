Membranes of the Brain and Spinal Cord. 94 434. The Brain and its Membranes. View from above. The Falx cerebri descends vertically in the longitudinal fissure between the two hemispheres of the brain; it is narrow in front, where it is attached to the Crista galli, broader behind, where it is connected with the tentorium. Along its upper convex border, which is attached to the inner surface of the skull as far back as the internal occipital protuberance, runs the superior longitudinal sinus, Sinus falci- formis superior; its free concave margin is turned towards the Corpus caMoswm, but does not touch it. The Falx cerebelli descends from the back part of the tentorium, with which it is connected, along the internal occipital crest, towards the Foramen magnum, bifurcating there into two smaller folds; its sinus is not constant. The Tentorium cerebelli is placed between the posterior lobes of the cerebrum and the hemispheres of the cerebellum; its anterior free border presents a large oval opening for the transmission of the Crura cerebri. The pituitary fossa of the body of the sphenoid bone is partially closed by a fourth process, the Opcrcullum sellae turcicae.

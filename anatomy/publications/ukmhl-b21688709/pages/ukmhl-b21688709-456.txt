Aorta, 188 530 a.b. Diagram of the Varieties of the Branches arising from the Transverse Arch by Abnormal Ramification. The variations in the origins of the vessels arising from the trans- verse arch of the aorta can take place in three different ways: the number of branches either diminishing, or increasing, or there being the normal number but an abnormal ramification. The diminution can take place in the following ways: a) two innominate arteries; b) the left carotid is a branch of the innominate; c) all the branches are united to form a single anterior aorta. The augmentation consists in the following varieties: a) the left vertebral artery arises between carotid and left subclavian; b) an Art. thyreoidca ima arises between innominate and left carotid; c) an internal mammary artery or Art. thymica arises from the anterior wall of the transverse arch; d) the innominate is not pre- sent and all branches arise separately. The abnormal ramification may take place in two ways: a) both carotids unite to form one innominate; b) the left caro- tid arises from the innominate, and the left vertebral artery arises alone.

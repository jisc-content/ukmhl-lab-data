Organ of Vision 225 303. Section at the Place where the Sclerotic is Continued into the Cornea. Magn. = 100. After a Specimen of Alex. Iwanoff. The choroid is supplied with blood by three or four short ciliary arteries, Arteriae ciliares posticae breves, the iris' and the ciliary muscle by the two long ciliary arteries, Arteriae ciliares posti- cae longae and the anterior ciliary, Arteriae ciliares anticae, whose number differs (all are branches of the ophthal- mic artery). The veins, Yasa vorticosa, four or five in num- ber, developed from the capil- laries, pierce the sclerotic about half way between the cornea and jilace of entrance of the optic nerve. The blood also flows through the Venae ciliares anticae et posticae. The iris, choroid and ciliary muscle are supplied by the ciliary nerves, which, ten to sixteen in number, pierce the sclerotic at its pos- terior portion ; also by fibres from the Nervus sympathicus.

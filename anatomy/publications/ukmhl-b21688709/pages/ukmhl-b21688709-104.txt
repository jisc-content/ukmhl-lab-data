76 Articulations of the Ribs. 96. Articulations between the Anterior Ends of the B.ibs and the Sternum, Articulationes costo-sternales, in section. The figure shows the direct connection between the bone of the Manubrium sterni and the cartilage of the first rib; the articular cavity between the cartilage of the second rib and the sternum is usually a double one, formed by a continuation of the cartilage between the Manubrium and Corpus sterni. The cavities of the other costo-sternal articulations are single; they may be wanting entirely at the sixth and seventh costal cartilage.

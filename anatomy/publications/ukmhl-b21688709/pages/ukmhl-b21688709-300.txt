Liver. 32 .361. The Liver, Hepar. View from below. The longitudinal fissure is divided by the transverse fissure (Porta Kepatis) into two parts; the anterior is called the umbilical fissure and lodges the round ligament, Ligammtwm teres, the posterior, called the fissure of the Ductus venosus, lodges the Ductus venosus Arantii. The fissure for the gall-bladder lodges the gall-bladder, and the fissure for the Vena cava, the inferior Vena cava, Vena cava ascendens. The vessels and nerves of the liver enter the transverse fissure, only the hepatic veins, Venae hepaticae, terminate in the inferior Vena cava. The peritoneal folds of the liver are: the suspensory liga- ment, Ligamentum suspensorium, attached by one margin to the under surface of the diaphragm and the anterior abdominal wall as far down as the umbilicus, and by its hepatic margin to the upper surface of the liver, and the coronary ligament, Ligamentum coronarium, attached to the posterior jjortion of the diaphragm and the posterior round border of the liver. The round ligament, Ligamentum teres, ascends from the umbilicus, enclosed in the longitudinal ligament, to the notch on the anterior border of the liver, and may be traced on the under surface of the liver, as far back as the inferior Vena cava.

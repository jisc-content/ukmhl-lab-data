Arteria iliaca interna. 229 576. The Ramification of the Internal Pudic Artery. 4. The transverse perineal, for the region between anus and Bulbus urethrae, is either a branch of the superficial perineal or the internal pudic; 5. The artery of the bulb of the urethra for the Bulbus urethrae and Cowper's glands; 6. The artery of the Corpus cavernosum, (Art. profunda penis) passes to the anterior extremity of the Corpus cavernosum. 7. The dorsal artery of the penis (or clitoris) ascends between the crus and pubic symphisis, runs forwards on the dorsum of the penis to the glans, and accompanies with the corresponding artery of the opposite side the dorsal vein of the penis. In the foetus the internal iliac artery is called the hypogastric; from it arises the umbilical artery, which, converging towards its fellow of the opposite side, passes to the umbilicus and from there to the umbilical cord, and ramifies in the placenta. After birth the umbilical arteries become imper- vious and form the Ligamenta vesico-umbilicalia lateralia. The obliteration continues up to the origin of the superior vesical artery. 30*

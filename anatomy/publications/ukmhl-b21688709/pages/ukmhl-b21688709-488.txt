Aorta ahdominaJis. 220 560. The Vasa intestini tenuis. The 16â€”18 intestinal arteries, Vasa intestini tenuis, pass between the two layers of the mesentery to the jejunum and ilium. Each vessel divides into two branches, which unite with a similar branch on each side, forming a series of arches. From these arches smaller bran- ches arise, which again unite with similar branches from either side, and thus a second series of arches is formed; from these latter, a third and even fourth or fifth series of arches are constituted, diminishing in size the nearer they approach the intestine. From the terminal arches, numerous small vessels, the Hamuli intestinales arise, which encircle the intestine, upon which they are distri- buted, ramifying thickly between its coats. The Art. ileo-colica, colica dextra and colica media also form a number of arches with each other, espe- cially at the angles between the ascending and transverse colon, and two or three between the transverse and descending colon. 3. The inferior mesenteric artery, Art. mesenterica inferior, divides soon after its origin into two branches: the Colica sinistra to the descending colon, and the superior haemorrhoidal artery to the sigmoid flexure and rectum. These branches too, anastomose with each other, forming arterial arches.

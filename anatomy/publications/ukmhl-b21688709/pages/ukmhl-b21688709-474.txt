550. The Arteries of the Shoulder. Further branches of the axillary artery are: d) The alar thoracic, Art. thoracica alaris, to the glands and areolar tissue of the axilla; not constant. e) The subscapular, Art. subscapular is, which distributes two or three upper, smaller, and one lower, larger branch, to the muscles in its neighbourhood. The lower gives off the Ramus thoracico-dor salts, which runs parallel to the outer border of the scapula and passes to the lower dentations of the M. serratus magnus and to the costal origins of the M. latis- simus dorsi and the Art. circumflexa scapulae, which passes between the M. subscapulars and teres major to the posterior surface of the scapula; it supplies the muscles in the infraspinous fossa. f) The anterior circumflex, Art. circumflexa humeri anterior, passes in front of the surgical neck of the humerus. g) The posterior circumflex, Art. circumflexa humeri posterior, much the larger, passes behind the surgical neck close to the bone. Both supply the soft parts at the shoulder joint and anastomose with each other.

Stomach. 24 352. The Stomach and the Duodenum, view from before. The oesophagus or gullet extends from the pharynx to the stomach. In the neck it lies behind and a little to the left of the trachea; it descends in the posterior mediastinum, opposite the place of bifurcation of the trachea, along the right side of the aorta, crosses the artery further down and passes through the oesophageal opening of the diaphragm to the stomach. The stomach, Vcntricidus s. stomachus, lies in the epigastric region; above it is the diaphragm, below the transverse colon, behind the pancreas, and to the left side the spleen. It presents a cardiac orifice, Cardia (Ostium oesophaycum) a pyloric orifice, Pylorus (Ostium duodenalr), and an expanded part, the great cul-de-sac or fundus, Fundus ventriculi. This is the largest part of the stomach, and from there it gradually narrows towards the pylorus, in front of which is a prominence or bulging, called the small cul-de-sac or Antrum pyloricum Willisii. At the pylorus, between the stomach and duodenum is a distinctly visible, slight constriction.

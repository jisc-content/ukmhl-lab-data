57 Ligaments of the Spine. 74. The Intervertebral Substance, Fibro-cartilago intervertebral is. Each intervertebral disc consists of a broad fibrous ring, which contains in its center a softer substance rising up somewhat on section. With the fibrous ring the Ligamentum longitudindle anterius and posterim are closely connected. The Ligamenta subflaua consist of elastic fibres and are attached each between the laminae of 2 vertebrae, so that they run from the lower margin of the lamina above to the posterior surface of the lamina below. The ascending and descending articular processes of the vertebrae form articulations, Articulationes 2^'ocessuwn articularium, which are surroun- ded by capsular ligaments. 75.

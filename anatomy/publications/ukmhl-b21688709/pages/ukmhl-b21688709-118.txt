Shoulder-Joint 111. The Shoulder-Joint, Articulatio humeri, in section. The margin of the glenoid cavity of the scapula is deepened by the Limbus cartilaginous. The fibrous and the synovial capsule lining it, bulge outwards as in all articulations, at different places, corresponding to the position of the bones which constitute the articulation. In the bicipital groove, or rather canal, the tendon of the long head of the M. biceps runs; the tendon is surrounded up to its origin at the highest point of the Limbus cartilaginous by a duplieature of the synovial capsule; this sheath stretches down to the place of insertion of the M. pectofalis major (Fig. 109).

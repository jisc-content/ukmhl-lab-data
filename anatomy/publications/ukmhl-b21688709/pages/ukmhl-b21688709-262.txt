Organ of Hearing. 234 Ampulla 319. The Osseous Labyrinth from before. Magn. = 3- The internal ear, the labyrinth, consists of the vestibule, Vestibulum, the three semicircular canals, Canales semicircu- lares, and the Cochlea. The vestibule is the central cavity of communi- cation between the semi- circular canals and the cochlea. Its boundaries are : Externally the tym- panic cavity (the Fene- stra ovalis, by means of which the tympanum and vestibule communciate, is closed by the base of the stapes); internally the internal auditory meatus; anteriorly the cochlea; posteriorly the semicir- cular canals; superi- orly the commencement of the Fallopian canal (Fig. 327). The anterior portion is called Recessus hemispluxericus; the posterior Recessus hemiellipticus; be- tween both is the Crista vesti- buli, which ends superiorly with the Pyramis vestibuli. The three semicircular ca- nals open into the Recessus hemiellipticus by five orifices, two canals at the inner wall of the vestibule having one common orifice; in front of the latter is the orifice of the Aquae- ductus vestibuli. The Scala vestibuli of the cochlea opens into the Recessus hcmisphaericus. The three Maculae cribrosae are seen in Fig. 321. ull/3 320. The Osseous Labyrinth laid open from before. Magn. = 3-

Arteria subclavia. 202 jÂ£A.communicnntcs posteriores 546. Course of the Vertebral Arteries. View from behind, the vertebral canal being laid open. The branches arising from the basilar artery on each side are: the internal auditory, Art. auditiva interna, passing through the internal auditory meatus to the labyrinth, and the superior cerebellar, Art. cerebelli superior, to the upper surface of the cerebellum. The posterior cerebral (Arteriae profundae cerebri), unite with the posterior communicating arteries from the internal carotid, pass backwards and upwards and supply the posterior lobes of the cerebrum. By the anastomosis which exists between the branches of the internal carotid and ver- tebral arteries at the base of the brain, the circle of Willis, Cir cuius arteriosus Willisii, is formed. The parts of the brain included within this circle are: the Chiasma, Lamina cinerea, Infundibtdum, Tuber cinereum, Corpora albicantia and posterior perforated space. 2. The internal mammary artery, Art. mammaria interna, arises from the subclavian opposite the thyroid axis, and descends behind the clavicle to the inner surface of the anterior wall of the chest. Its branches are: mediastinal, thymic, anterior bronchial, pericardiaco-phrenic to the diaphragm, the anterior intercostal, two for each intercostal space, an upper, larger, and a lower, smaller, perforating branches, Hami per for antes, to the skin and muscles of the thorax, and in the female the external mammary artery to the mamma. Between the sixth costal cartilage and xiphoid appendix, the inter- nal mammary artery divides into the musculo-phrenic and superior epi- gastric, which latter anastomoses with the inferior epigastric and crural arteries (see Fig. 548).

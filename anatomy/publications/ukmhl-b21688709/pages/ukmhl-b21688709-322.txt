54 Topography. 390. Topograph)' of the Thoracic Viscera. Owing to the oblique position of the heart, towards the left side, the anterior mediastinum is not parallel with the sternum, but directed obliquely from above downwards and to the left of the median line; its length corresponds to that of the sternum. The posterior mediastinum is an irregular triangular space, running parallel with the vertebral column; the organs contained in it are evident from Fig. 389, in which the left lung and the heart are lifted out of the thorax and laid to the right and the lateral wall of the posterior mediastinal space is dissected away. The arch of the aorta curves over the left bronchus; the oesophagus forms a spiral around the aorta; to the right of the descending aorta is the Vena azygps, to the left the Vena hemiazygos. Between the Vena azygos and aorta is the thoracic duct, Ductus tlioracicus (see Fig. 388), which ascends behind and to the left of the oesophagus, to terminate at the angle of junction of the left subclavian and internal jugular veins.

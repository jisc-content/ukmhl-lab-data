Cranial Nerves. 130 474. The Lingual Nerve and the Submaxillary Ganglion. h) The gustatory or lingual nerve, Nervus lingualis, unites with the Chorda tympani and passes with it along the outer side of the M. styloglossus and M. hyo-glossus obliquely forwards and downwards; it sends branches to the Arcus palato-glossus, to the mucous membrane at the floor of the mouth, to the submaxillary ganglion and to the sub- lingual gland. Finally it is divided into from eight to ten lingual or terminal branches, which perforate the muscular structure of the tongue and terminate in the papillae (with the exception of the Papillae va/latac and many P. filiformes). c) The inferior dental nerve s. Nervus mandibular is, situated behind the N. lingualis, and connected with it by one or two filaments, passes along the outer side of the M. pterygoideus intemus to the inner opening of the inferior dental canal; its branches are: the m y 1 o - h y o i d, N. mylo-hyoideus, for the mylo-hyoid muscle and anterior belly of the digastric; the dental branches which supply the molar and bicuspid teeth together with the adjoining part of the gum; the incisor branch, which supplies filaments to the canine and incisor teeth; finally the mental branch, N. mentalis, which emerges from the bone by the mental foramen, and supplies the integument, mucous membrane and muscles of the lower lip.

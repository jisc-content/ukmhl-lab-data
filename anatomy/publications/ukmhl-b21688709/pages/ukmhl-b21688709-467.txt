Carotis interna. 199 A., â€¢palpebr, i-rvt. 543. Ramification of the Ophthalmic Artery in the Orbit. Natural size. After the internal carotid has emerged from the cavernous sinus, it gives off: 1. The ophthalmic artery, Art. ophthalmica, which passes through the optic foramen into the orbit and divides below the trochlea into two terminal branches, the nasal, Art. dorsalis nasi, and the frontal, Art. frontalis. Its branches are: a) The small Arteria centralis retinae, which pierces the sheath and substance of the optic nerve, and runs forwards within it to the retina; b) The lachrymal artery, Art. lacrymalis, which passes for- wards along the upper border of the external rectus muscle to the lachry- mal gland and gives off 1 or 2 posterior ciliary arteries, sends malar branches into the Canalis zygomaticus facialis and temporalis, and divides atthe external angle of the eye into the Art. palpebralis externa superior et inferior; c) Muscular branches for the muscles of the eye-ball; d) 2 long and 3 or 4 short posterior ciliary arteries, Arteriae ciliarcs jiosticac longae and breves, the former to the iris and ciliary muscle, the latter to the choroid; e) The supraorbital, Art. supraorbital, through the supraorbital foramen to the forehead; f) The anterior and posterior ethmoidal, Art. cthnoidalis anterior etposterior, the former to the cranium where it gives off a meningeal branch, the^ri. meningea anterior, and a nasal branch, which passes through the an- terior foramen in the cribriform plate of the ethmoid to the nasal cavity; the latter through the posterior ethmoidal foramen to the posterior ethmoidal cells.

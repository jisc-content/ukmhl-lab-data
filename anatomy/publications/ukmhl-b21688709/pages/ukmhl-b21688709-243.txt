215 Organ of Smell, 288. The Cartilaginous and Bony Septum of the Nose, Septum narium cartilagineum et osseum. The cartilage of the septum, Septum cartilagineum seu Carti- lago quadrangular is, completes the bony septum formed by the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone and the vomer; at its anterior inferior margin is the Septum membranaceum. Below the nasal bones are the two t r i a n g u- lar cartilages, Cartilagines triangulares (upper lateral cartilages, Fig. 2 91), and in the upper half of the wings of the nose, the two alar carti- lages, Cartilagines alares (lower lateral cartilages, Fig. 291); between these and the margin of the Incisura pyriformis are the sesamoid cartilages, Cartilagines sesamoideae seu minores. The nasal cavity is lined by the pituitary or Schnei dorian membrane, Membrana pituitaria narium, which is continuous with the skin through the nostrils, with the mucous membrane of the pharynx through the posterior nares, Choanae. In the upper or olfactory region of the mucous membrane, Begio olfactoria, the filaments of the olfactory nerve are distributed, and in this portion the sense of smell is lodged. In the lower or respiratory region, Regio respiratorhi, the filaments of the nasal bran- ches of the Nervus trigeminus ramify, and in this part the sense of touch only is lodged (Fig. 293).

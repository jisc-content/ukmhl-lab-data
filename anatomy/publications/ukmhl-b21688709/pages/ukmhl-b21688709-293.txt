25 Stomach. 353. The Stomach and the Duodenum, after removal of the anterior wall. Between the cardiac and pyloric orifices the outline of the stomach is curved along its upper and lower borders; the upper con- cave border forms the lesser curvature, Curvatwra minor, and the lower convex, the greater curva tur e, Curvatwra major. The two sur- faces of the organ, the anterior, and the posterior, are limited by these two curvatures. If the stomach is filled, the anterior surface becomes an upper, and the posterior surface a lower. The peritoneal covering of the stomach is continued from it to the neighbouring organs by means of duplicatures; where the membrane passes from the cardia to the diaphragm, it forms the g a s t r o - p h r e n i c ligament, Ligamentum-phrenico-gastricum; where it passes from the fundus of the stomach to the spleen, it forms the g a s t r o - s p 1 e n i c ligament, Ligamentum gastro-lienale; from the lesser curvature of the stomach to the transverse fissure of the liver it forms the lesser omentum, Ligamentum hepato-gastricum, s. Omentum minus. The great omentum, Ligamentum gastro-colicum s. Omentum majus, passes down from the greater curvature of the stomach, covering the small intestines; it is a duplicature of the peritoneum, which then ascends to the trans- verse colon, and thence extends back to the pancreas (see Fig. 368 and 369)- The layers of the stomach from without inwards are: the peritoneum (serous coat), the muscular coat (longitudinal, circular and oblique fibres), and the mucous membrane rich in glands.

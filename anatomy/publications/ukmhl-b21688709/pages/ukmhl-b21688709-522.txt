254 Portal Vein. 606. The Ramifications in the Liver of the Portal Vein of a Child. After a specimen of Hyrtl. 4/, natural size. c) The inferior mesenteric vein, whose branches correspond to those of the inferior mesenteric artery, and which usually empties into the splenic vein (s. Fig. 605). d) The splenic vein, which runs along the upper border of the pancreas, and opens into the portal vein. The branches of origin of the portal vein unite behind the head of the pancreas to form the Truncus venae, portae, which receives the V. gastro-epiploica and the V. cystidis felleae. The ramifications of the portal vein in the liver arise from two branches and, in the lobes of the liver, pass on into the capillaries. The circulation of the foetal system is shown in Fig. 607- In it, the arterial blood (V. umbilicalis) is marked by transverse lines, the venous blood — system of the two Venae cavae — by longitudinal lines, the mixed blood, which circulates everywhere in the foetus, by lines crossing each other. The direction of the current of the blood is shown by the arrows.

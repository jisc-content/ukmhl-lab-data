200 Arteria subclavia. 544. Diagram of the Ramification of the Subcla- vian Artery. Further branches of the ophthalmic artery are: g) The palpebral, Art. pal2)ebi'alis interna superior et inferior, which supply the lachrymal sac, caruncle and conjunctiva, and pass into the eyelids; h) The frontal, Art. frontalis, passes around the Margo infraorbitalis to the forehead; i) The nasal, Art. dorsalis nasi, perforates the M. orbicularis and finally unites with the angular artery, the termination of the facial. Other branches of the internal carotid are: 2. The posterior communicating, Art. communicans posterior, which, passing backwards, anastomoses with the posterior cerebral, and helps to form the circle of Willis, Circulus arteriosus Willisii. 3. The choroid, Art. choroidea to the Plexus clioroideus lateralis. 4. The anterior cerebral or Art. corporis callosi, passes for- wards, is connected by means of the anterior communicating artery with the corresponding artery of the other side, and ascends to the Corpus callosum, to supply the hemispheres of the brain. 5. The middle cerebral or Art. fossae Sylvii divides in the fossa of Sylvius into a number of branches for the anterior and inferior cerebral lobes.

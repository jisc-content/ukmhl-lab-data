Veins. 597. The Venous Plexus of the Spermatic Cord, Plexus pampini- formis. The inferior Vena cava is formed by the junction of the right and left common iliac veins. It perforates the central tendon of the diaphragm, enters the pericardium, and ter- minates in the lower and back part of the right auricle of the heart. â€” Each common iliac vein is formed by the union of the external (V. cruralis) and internal (V. liypogastrica) iliac veins. The left common iliac vein is longer than the right, and receives the two Venae sacrales mediae. The V. cava inferior receives: a) The lumbar veins, which freely anastomose with each other and form the Plexus venosus lumbalis; b) The internal spermatic veins arise from the pampiniform plexus of the sper- matic cord, and ascend, the one on the right side directly to the V. cava inferior, the one on the left side to the renal vein; c) The renal veins, the left longer than the right; d) The suprarenal veins, the left of which usually opens into the left renal vein ; e) The hepatic veins, two or three larger and several smaller; f) The phrenic veins. In the foetus the umbilical vein also opens into the inferior Vena cava, whereby this vein receives arterial blood (see Fig. 607).

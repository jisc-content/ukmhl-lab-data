The cavity of the uterus, Cavum uteri, is triangular; its base is directed upwards towards the Fundus uteri; in the two angles of the triangle are the openings of the two tubes; the inferior portion is prolonged into the cavity of the cervix, Canalis cervicis uteri. This canal is somewhat dilated in the middle, its upper extremity opening into the cavity of the uterus is called the internal orifice, Orificium uterinum, its lower end opening into the vagina is called the external orifice, Orificium vaginale. The external orifice presents, before a labor has taken place, a smooth, trans- verse aperture, with an anterior longer lip, Labium anterius, and a posterior shorter lip, Labium posterius; after parturition, the external orifice becomes irregular, and sometimes fissured or cleft. The uterus is composed of three coats: a) an external, derived from the peritoneum, only present at the anterior and posterior surfaces and fundus of the uterus; b) an internal mucous membrane, which, on the anterior and posterior walls of the cavity of the cervix, forms rugae, the Palmae plicatae s. Arbor vitae (see Fig. 415). Between the rugae are closed follicles, the Ovula Nabotlu; in the cavity of the uterus, the mucous membrane has numerous tubular glands, the Glandulae utrioulares. c) The middle, very dense coat of the uterus consists of smooth muscular fibres, which are disposed in bundles and cross each other in different directions; between the bundles are blood-vessels and areolar tissue. In the pregnant uterus the muscle fibres are increased by new formations both in thickness and length.

Small Intestine. 26 The d node n u m presents a curve, embracing the head of the pancreas; it is divided into a superior or superior transverse, a descending, and an oblique or inferior transverse portion. The superior portion is nearly completely invested by peritoneum; the inferior transverse portion lies between the two layers of the transverse mesocolon; the descending portion is covered by peritoneum only on its anterior surface. The jejunum and ilium form numerous convolutions in the abdominal and pelvic regions; they present no characteristic marks to distinguish the, termination of the one and the commencement of the other; they are attached to the mesentery, Mese.nte.rium, and by its root, Radix mesenterii, to the lumbar portion of the vertebral column. The layers of the small intestine are the same as those of the stomach: peritoneum (serous coat), muscular coat (consisting of external longitudinal and internal circular fibres), and the mucous mem- brane, which consists of a layer of muscular tissue, of folds called Valvular, conniventes, of villi and of glands.

264 Lymphatics. 617. The Lymphatics of the Thorax. The lymphatics of the thoracic cavity are the folio wing: a) The intercostal lymphatics, which accompany the Vasa intercostalia. They pass out. from the lateral wall of the thorax and abdomen, from the diaphragm, the pleura, the muscles of the back and the vertebral column and pass through 16—20 intercostal glands. b) The mediastinal lymphatics emerge from the pericardium, the oesophagus and the posterior mediastinum and pass through 8—12 posterior mediastinal glands. c) The internal thoracic lymphatics pass through 10—14 anterior mediastinal glands, also 6—8 sternal glands. They form the internal mammary plexus, which empties into the two Ductus thoracici by means of the Trunci mammarii. d) The lymphatics of the lungs, partly superficial, partly deep, pass through the bronchial glands; on the left side they run to the thoracic duct, on the right side through the Truncus broncho-mediasttnicus to the right lymphatic duct.

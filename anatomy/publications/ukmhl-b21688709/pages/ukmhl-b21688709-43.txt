15 Bones of the Cranium. 15, Left Temporal Bone, Os temporum, from the inner side. The squamous p.ortion shows on its internal surface strong- eminences and depressions for the cerebral convolutions, Tmpressiones digitatae and Juga cerebralia, and 2 grooves (for the middle meningeal artery and vein). The petrous portion has 3 surfaces (posterior, superior and inferior) and 3 borders (superior, anterior and posterior). On the smallest posterior surface the oval orifice of the Meatus auditonus interims (Meatus acusticus interims), 3"' externally of this, that of the Aquaeductus vestibxdi: The largest superior surf a c e is separated from the squamous portion by the Sutura (Fissura) petroso-squamosa; it has an eminence for the superior semicircular canal, Eminentia canalis scmicircu- laris superioris. Near the summit of the pyramid the inner opening of the carotid canal, Canalis caroticus, from which a groove (Semicanalis Nervi Vidiami) leads externally -to a small foramen, the Hiatus (Apertura spuria) canalis Fallopiae. In this groove opens the small Canalicidus petrosus. The upper border of the petrous portion is grooved for the superior petrosal sinus, Sulcus petrosus superior: the posterior border excavated by the Incisura jugularis. The mastoid portion shows on its inner surface a deep groove, Fossa sigmoidea (for 1 he Sinus transversus); a foramen, not always present, the Foramen mastoidcum (for an Emissarium Santorini), leads from this groove to the external surface of the bone.

Topography. (i 331. Frontal Section of the Base of the Cranium and the Face immediately behind the posterior border of the Septum narium. After H. v. L u s c h k a. The tonsils, Tonsillae s. Amygdalae, which are conglomerates of follicular glands, lie in the triangular space between the anterior and posterior pillars of the soft palate. The space between the lower margin of the palatine arches, the base of the tongue and between both tonsils, leading from the mouth into the pharynx, is called isthmus of the fauces, Isthmus fauchim (see Fig. 330). The isthmus of the fauces changes in shajie; the muscles of the soft palate contract and expand, elevate and depress it; with each act of deglutition the soft palate is raised and made tense, the posterior pillars of the fauces brought together, thus forming a narrow slit, which is entirely closed by the uvula; this prevents the passage of food towards the upper part of the pharynx or the posterior nares.

67 Male Organs of Generation. 400. Testis and Epididymis, Injected with Mercury. The epididymis lies at the posterior border of the testis; it- has an upper enlarged extremity, the head, or Globus major, and a lower pointed extremity, the tail, or Globus minor, which is continued into the Vas deferens. The lobules, which are formed by the convolutions of the seminiferous tubules coming from the testis, are of pyramidal form and are called Coni vasculosi Holler i. By the union of these coni a single canal or duct is formed, the intervening and subsequent convolutions of which constitute the epididymis itself. This single canal gradually becomes thicker at the Globus minor of the epididymis, its windings become less and less tortuous, and now the Vas deferens is formed, which ascends from the lower end of the epididymis along the back of the testicle; it then passes in the spermatic cord to the inguinal canal, through this to the abdominal cavity and the posterior wall of the bladder, and finally opens at the base of the bladder, after union with the corresponding seminal vesicle, in the Caput gattinaginis. Attached to the upper end of the testis or to the epididymis are one or more small pedunculated bodies; these are termed Hydatis Mbrgagni (see Fig. 405). With the duct of the epididymis is often connected a small convoluted duct, the Yasculum aberrans Halleri. 9*

Topograph}', 62 400. Sagittal Median Section through the Male Pelvis. From the frozen cadaver of a man of about twenty years. The urinary bladder, Vesica urinaria, is the reservoir for the urine; it is of oval form and lies behind the Symphisis ossium pubis, in front of the rectum in the male, of the uterus in the female. Its summit, Vertex, is connec- ted to the umbilius by means of the Ligamentum vesico-umbilicale medium (urachus) ; the body becomes enlarged posteriorly and interiorly into the base or Fundus vesicae; the sides are connected to the umbilicus by means of the Ligamenta vesico-umb'dkalia latcralia (obliterated hypogastric arteries). ■— The bladder has the following layers: peritoneum at the summit, the posterior wall and the sides; muscular layer composed of longitudinal and transverse fibres (Detrusor urinae) and of circular fibres (Sphincter vesicae); submucous connective tissue and finally the mucous membrane covered with stratefied epithelium. The ureters pass obliquely downwards and inwards, enter the coats of the bladder, and open into the fundus of the bladder by two narrow and oblique slit-like openings; at the line of union of these with the urethra is the trigone, Trigonum Lieutandii; the summit of this triangle is called Uvula vesicae (see f ig. 403); here the muscular layer of the bladder is more strongly developed.

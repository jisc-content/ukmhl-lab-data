The Fibres of the Truncus Cerebri.* View from above. Natural size. The grey substance of the brain and spinal cord consists principally of ganglion cells. In the spinal cord it forms the nucleus, is continued along the floor of the III. and IV. ventricles up to the Tuber ciuereum and Infundilndum, forms a layer on the convolutions of the cerebrum and cerebellum, finally separate grey masses so-called nuclei; such nuclei are the grey masses of the olivary bodies, of the hemispheres of the cerebellum, the Corpora quadrigemina, the optic thalami and Corpora striata, the Pons Varolii, then the Tuber cinereum of the restiform bodies, the lenticular nucleus, the claustrum and amygdalae of the cerebrum. The three pairs of columns of the cord are continued into the Medulla oblongata as pyramids, olivary bodies and restiform bodies, the lateral columns becoming the pyramids, the anterior the olivary bodies, and the posterior the restiform bodies. The pyramids arc continued upwards into the Pednnculi cerebri, the olivary bodies run to the Corpus quadrigeminum and the restiform bodies form the Pechvnculi cerebclli. ■See note, page 122.

30 Bones of the Face. 36. Left Inferior Turbi- nated Bone, Concha inferior, from the inside. 37. Left Inferior Turbi- nated Bone, Concha inferior, from the outside. The inferior turbinated bone is situated at the inner wall of the body of the superior maxilla; its concave surface looks toward this wall, its convex surface toward the Sej)tnm narium. The lower mar- gin is rolled upon itself; at the upper margin arises the maxillary pro- cess, Processus maxillaris, which helps to make the opening of the antrum of Highmore smaller. In front of this process, the lachrymal process, Processus lacrymalis, is situated, partially forming the Canalis naso-lacrymalis. The ethmoidal process, Processus etltmotdalis, is not constant. The anterior and posterior ends of the bone come in contact with the inferior tur- binated crest of the superior maxillary and palate bones. The inferior turbinated bone articulates with 4 bones: 1 cranial bone, the ethmoid, and 3 of the face, the superior maxillary, palate and lachry- mal bones.

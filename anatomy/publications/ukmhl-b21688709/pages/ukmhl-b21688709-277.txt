9 Teeth. 334. Incisor, Bicuspid and Molar Teeth, in section. That part of the teeth, Denies, which projects above the gums, is called body or crown, Corona; the part fixed in an alveolus of the upper or lower jaw, the root, Radix; between the crown and the root is the constricted portion, the neck, Collum, covered by the gums. Cor- responding to the crown and neck of the tooth, a hollow cavity, Cavum dentis, is found in its interior; this is continuous with a canal, Canalis radicis, which opens by a minute orifice at the extremity of the root. The cavity is occupied by a soft, highly vascular and sensitive substance, the dental pulp, Pulpa dentis. The tooth is composed of three substances: a) The enamel, Substantia adamantina s. vitrea, encrusts and pro- tects the crown; it is thickest on the grinding surface of the crown, and becoming gradually thinner, ends at the neck; it consists of hard and dense hexagonal fibres, which pursue a more or less wavy course. b) The ivory or dentine, Ebur s. Substantia propria, forms the body of the tooth; it consists of a structureless mass, which has numerous, very fine tubes, opening at their inner ends into the pulp cavity, and pursuing a wavy and undulating course towards the periphery. c) The cement, Crusta ostoides radicis, covers the external surface of the root, and has the structure of bone.

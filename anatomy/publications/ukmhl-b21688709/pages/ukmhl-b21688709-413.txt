145 Spinal Nerves. 489. The Cervical Portion of the Spinal Cord with its Membranes. View from behind. The spinal cord extends only to the first or second lumbar vertebra. The length of the roots of the lumbar, sacral and coccygeal nerves therefore, increases rapidly from nerve to nerve, and may be estimated by the distance of the foramen of exit from the extremity of the cord; owing to their length and the appearance they present in connection with the spinal cord, the aggregation of the roots of these nerves has been named horse's tail, Cauda equina. At the Conus terminalis of the spinal cord the pia mater is continued as FUwm tcrminale, down to the lower end of the impervious sheath of the dura mater, which runs down to the end of the sacral canal. The intervertebral ganglia of the cervical, dorsal and lumbar nerves lie within the intervertebral foramina; those of the sacral nerves in the spinal canal external to the dura mater; those of the coccygeal nerve within the latter. The largest nervous divisions of the spinal cord are the sacral nerves, which form the sacral ple- xus, Plexus sacrah's.

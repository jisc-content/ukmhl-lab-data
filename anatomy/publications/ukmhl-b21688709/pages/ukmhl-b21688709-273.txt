Oral Cavity. 5 330. Frontal View of the Opened Oral Cavity. The oral cavity is divided by the closed rows of teeth into the Yestibulum oris and the Cavum oris proper. The anterior opening forms the Mima oris, bounded by the lips, Labia, which are connected at their inner surfaces to the gums, Gingivae, by folds of mucous membrane, the Fraenulum labii superior is et inferior is. The lips and inner part of the oral cavity are lined by mucous membrane, which becomes continuous with the tongue, on both sides, and on the under surface from the Fraenulum linguae, and which sepa- rates the mouth from the pharynx at the border of the hard palate, by means of a pendent fold, the soft palate, Palatum nolle. The soft palate (Velum pendulum palati) constitutes a moveable partition between the mouth and pharynx, directed obliquely downwards and backwards; hanging from the middle of its lower free border is the Uvvla, and arching outwards and downwards from the base of the uvula on each side are the arches or pillars of the soft palate, Arcus palatini, the anterior of which, running downwards, outwards and forwards to the tongue, is called Arcus palato-glossus, the posterior, downwards, out- wards and backwards to the sides of the pharynx, Arcus palato-pliaryngcus.

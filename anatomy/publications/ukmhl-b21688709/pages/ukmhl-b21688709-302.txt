Natural size. The gall-bladder, Cystis fettea s. Cholecystis, is lodged in a fossa on the under surface of the right lobe of the liver; it is pear- shaped; its fundus projects from the anterior border of the liver, its curved and constricted neck terminates in the cystic duct, Ductus cysticus. The mucous membrane is elevated into numerous small ridges; in the neck of the bladder and the cystic duct the mucous membrane is elevated into a series of folds, so as to present very much the appearance of a spiral valve, the Yalvula Hdsteri. The cystic duct unites with the hepatic duct which issues from the transverse fissure of the liver to form the common bile duct, Ductus communis choledochus; this is about the diameter of a goose-quill. The Ductus choledochus unites with the Ductus pancreaticus and runs along the posterior wall of the descending portion of the duodenum; it forms an elevation beneath the mucous membrane and opens on the inner surface of the intestine. The gall-bladder has an external fibrous coat, a middle muscular coat (longitudinal and transverse fibres) and the internal mucous membrane; it is lined by j^eritoneum only on its under surface and its fundus.

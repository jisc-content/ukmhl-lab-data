Topography. 56 393. Horizontal Section of the Thorax at the lower end of the Gladiolus of the Sternum, immediately above the summit of the Diaphragm. Fig. 370, 391, 392 and 393 are drawings from sections, which were made with the saw from the frozen cadaver of a child about a year old; these drawings are made in natural size. The same thing holds good for these, which was said for the sections from frozen extremities, that is, the sections were made from the lower cut surface, so that, supposing the cadaver to stand erect, the drawings are seen in bird's eye view.

Muscles of the Lower Extremity. 199 The Muscles at the Anterior Side: M. tibialis anticus arises from the external tuberosity and outer surface of the tibia, the interosseous membrane and Fascia cruris; it is inserted into the internal cuneiform bone and base of the metatarsal bone of the great toe (Fig. 272). (Flexes the tarsus and raises the inner border of the foot.) M. extensor proprius pollicis seu extensor pollicis (hallucis) longus arises from the middle two-fourth of the anterior sur- face of the fibula and the interosseous membrane; it is inserted into the II. pha- lanx of the great toe (Fig. 272). M. extensor digitorum communis longus arises from the head and anterior sur- face of the fibula, the outer tuberosity of the tibia and the interosseous mem- brane ; it is inserted by four tendons into the aponeurosis on the back of the II. and III. phalanges of the four outer toes, and by a fifth tendon into the base of the fifth metatarsal bone; this fifth , tendon is often spoken of as the 31. peroneus tertius (Fig. 272). The Muscles on the Outer Side: M. peroneus longus (Fig. 269) arises by two heads from the head and upper two-thirds of the outer surface of the shaft of the fibula, and, running ob- liquely across the Planta pedis, it is inserted into the internal cuneiform bone, and base of the I. and II. meta- tarsal bones (Fig. 276 and 277). (Extends the foot and everts the sole of the foot.) M. peroneus brevis arises from the lower two-thirds of the external sur- face of the shaft of the fibula, and is inserted into the projection at the base of the fifth metatarsal bone (Fig. 272). (Extends and abducts the foot.) 267. The Muscles at the Anterior and Outer Sides of the Le^.

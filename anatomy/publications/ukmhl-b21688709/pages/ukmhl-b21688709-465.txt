Carotis externa. 197 541. The Arteries of the Septum narium. (Natural size.) The branches arising from the third or s p h e n o - rn a x i 11 a r y portion of the internal maxillary artery are: a) The superior alveolar, Art. alveolaris superior. Its branches run through the foramina of the tuberosity of the superior maxillary bone to the back teeth of the upper jaw and to the mucous membrane of the antrum of Highmore. b) The infra-orbital, Art. infraorhitalis, runs along the infraorbital canal, supplies the Periorbita, the MM. rectus and obtiquus inferior, the anterior teeth of the upper jaw, passes through the infraorbital foramen to the face, and finally anastomoses with the other arteries of the face. c) The descending palatine, Art. palatina descendens s. pterygo- palatina, sends the Vidian artery, Art. Vidiana, in the Vidian canal to the upper portion of the pharynx, and divides into three branches, which pass through the descending palatine canals to the soft palate and the tonsils. Its largest branch, the anterior palatine, passes along the hard palate to the gums of the incisor teeth and gives off the Art. incisiva to the nasal cavity. d) The spheno-palatine, Art. splieno-palatina, passes through the spheno-palatine foramen into the nasal cavity and supplies the posterior portions of the mucous membrane and the Septum narium, and finally anastomoses with the anterior palatine and the Art. septi mobilis nasi. 26*

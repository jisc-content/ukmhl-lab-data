Spinal Nerves. 144 OommtesuTa media 488. Diagram of the Origins of the Spinal Nerves. The spinal nerves, Nervi spinales, are 31 pairs, and these are: 8 cervical, 12 dorsal, 5 lumbar, 5 sacral and 1 (very rarely 2) coccy- geal pairs. Each spinal nerve has two roots, an anterior, smaller, and a posterior, larger; they appear as flat fibrous bundles at the anterior and posterior margins of the lateral tract, pass through the interverte- bral foramen and unite to form a single rounded cord. The posterior root only, is marked by a ganglion, the Ganglion intervertebrale, formed in the intervertebral foramen. This root is sensory, the anterio r, motor. The single cord formed by the two roots divides again, into an anterior and a posterior division or branch, both of which receive motor, as well as sensory fibres. The anterior larger division communicates with the neighbouring sympathetic ganglion, and the neigh- bouring anterior divisions of the spinal nerves, whereby loops, Ansae, are formed, which are present everywhere except at the dorsal nerves, where they are not constant. These ansae unite to form plexuses, Plexus cervlcalis, lumbalis and sacralis. The posterior divisions, irregularly united with the neighbouring branches, pass backwards to the muscles and skin of the back ; they, however, supply only the long- muscles of the back, the broad muscles being supplied by nerves from the plexus of the anterior divisions of the spinal nerves.

Topography. 177 233. Horizontal Section through the Shoulder, in the Region of the Great Tuberosity. For all sections the following will serve as an explanation: The sections were made with the saw on hard frozen cadavers, and the drawings taken in 2/3 the natural size, after the sawn surface was washed with water, and slightly thawed. For all horizontal sections the right extremity was chosen, and the drawings made from the lower cut surface; we therefore see the sections as if on a person standing with his right side towards us, in bird's eye view. By a horizontal section is meant one which falls vertically on the long axis of the body (the extremity); by a frontal section one which divides the body (the extremity) into an anterior and a posterior half; by a sagittal section one, which runs parallel with the median plane, therefore divides the body (the extremity) into a right and left, or external and internal half.

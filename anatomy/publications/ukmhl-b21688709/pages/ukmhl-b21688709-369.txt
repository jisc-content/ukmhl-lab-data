101 Cerebrum. 441. Horizontal Section of the Cerebrum, with partly evened Lateral Ventricles. 2/3 natural size. The Corpus callosum s. Commissural maxima, connects the two hemi- spheres of the cerehrum, its white substance being continuous with the internal medullary matter of both hemispheres; this large white medul- lary mass, surrounded by the margin of grey matter, is known as the Tegmentum ventriculorum s. Centrum semiovale Vieussenii. Along the middle of the upper surface of the Corpus callosum is a longitudinal furrow, Raphe superior corporis callosi, which is bounded by two, slightly elevated bands, the Striae lonc/itudinales Lancisii, and crossed by transverse furrows, .Chordae transversales Willisii. Its anterior border curves downwards and backwards to the Tuber cincreum and Corpora mamillaria at the base of the brain; in its course, it forms a distinct bend, the Genu corporis callosi; posteriorly, the Corpus callosum forms a thick rounded fold, the Splenium s. Tuber corporis callosi. 14*

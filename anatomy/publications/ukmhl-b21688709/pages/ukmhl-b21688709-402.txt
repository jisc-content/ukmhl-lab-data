134 Cranial Nerves. portio -â€”y INTERMED. -' WRISBERGII 478. The Portio intermedia Wrisbergii after E. Bischoff. The seventh or facial nerve, Nervus facialis, is the great motor nerve of the face. It arises from the lateral tract of the Medulla oblongata by two roots; the anterior root from the restiform body, the posterior as Portio intermedia of Wrisberg from the floor of the fourth ventricle. Both trunks lie in a groove of the auditory nerve, with which the Portio intermedia is connected. At the bottom of the internal auditory meatus the facial nerve leaves the auditory; it enters the Aquaeductus FaEopii and follows the windings of that canal; after having passed at first horizontally outwards, it bends sharply backwards, forming the genu; here it presents a reddish enlargement, the geniculate ganglion, Ganglion geniculi. This ganglion receives the great superficial petrosal nerve, and a twig of the small superficial petrosal, also filaments from the sympathetic plexus accompanying the middle meningeal artery. From the genu in the Aquaeductus Fallopii, the direction of the canal and the facial nerve lying in it, is backwards and finally downwards to the stylo- mastoid foramen. Behind the genu, two branches are given off from the facial nerve; the smaller, tympanic branch, leaves the facial trunk opposite the pyramid of the tympanic cavity, to supply the stapedius muscle (see Fig. 482 ); the larger, the Chorda tympani, leaves the trunk above the stylo- mastoid foramen, passes through a small canal, the Canalicidus chordae, into the tympanic cavity, then between the handle of the malleus and long- process of the incus to the Glaserian fissure, and finally unites with the lingual nerve, to which it supplies motor fibres.

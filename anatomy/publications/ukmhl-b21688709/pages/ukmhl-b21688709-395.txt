Cranial Nerves. 127 471. The First Division (Ramus ophthalmicus) of the Trigeminal Nerve. The I. ophthalmic branch, the smallest of the three divisions of the fifth nerve, is a sensory nerve; it passes forwards and upwards along the outer wall of the cavernous sinus, communicates with the sympathetic nerve and Nervus trochharis, and' gives off a recurrent filament, Ramus recurrens Arnold!, to the dura mater. Before its entrance into the sphenoidal fissure (Fissuva orhi- talis superior) it is divided into three branches; these are: a) The lachrymal, N. lacrymalis, which runs along the upper border of the external rectus muscle, gives off a twig to the orbital nerve and passes to the lachrymal gland, conjunctiva and skin at the outer canthus of the eye. b) The frontal, N. frontalis, situated below the roof of the orbit, divides into: the supratrochlear branch, which, running above the M. obliquus superior, leaves the orbit above the Trochlea to be distributed to the skin of the upper eyelid and the forehead; the supraorbital branch, which, usually divided into two twigs, passes through the supraorbital notch to the forehead, being distributed to the skin of the fore and upper parts of the scalp. c) The nasal or naso-ciliary, N. naso-ciliaris, lies at first on the outer side of the optic nerve, passes through the origin of the external rectus muscle with the abducens nerve, forms the long root of the ciliary gang- lion, Radix longa s. sensitiva Ganglii ciliaris (see Fig. 469), reaches the inner side of the optic nerve, giving off 1 â€” 2 ciliary nerves, and is finally divided into the ethmoidal nerve, which at first passes through the anterior ethmoidal foramen into the cranial cavity and then through the cribriform plate into the nasal cavity, supplying the Septum narium, external wall of nasal cavity, and finally the integument of the nose; and the infratrochlear nerve, passing below the Trochlea to the structures at the inner angle of the eye.

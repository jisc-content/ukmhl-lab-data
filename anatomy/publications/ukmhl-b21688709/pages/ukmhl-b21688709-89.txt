Ligaments of the Spine. 70. The Ligaments between the Axis, Atlas and Occipital Bone, seen from the vertebral canal. The strong transverse ligament, Ligamentum transversum atlantis, presses the odontoid process of the axis toward the articular surface of the anterior arch of the atlas. From the upper border of this ligament .a ligamentous crus goes to the anterior border of the Foramen occipitale magnum, and a similar crus from its lower border to the body of the axis; the vertical crura form with the Ligamentum trans- versum the crucial ligament, Ligamentum cruciatum. The odontoid process is fixed at the anterior border of the Foramen magnum, by three ligaments, of which the middle is called Ligamentum susijensorium, the two lateral Ligamenta alaria. In the figure the capsular ligaments of the occipito-atloid articulations are also shown. The upper vertical crus of the crucial ligament is drawn somewhat aside, to show the Ligamentum suspensorium.

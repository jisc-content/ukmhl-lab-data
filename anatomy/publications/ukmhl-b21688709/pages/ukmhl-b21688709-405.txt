Cranial Nerves. 13/ < "'HIIf I'l" N. COCHLEAE 481. Section of the Cochlea, with the Expansion of the NeVVUS cochleae. After Riidinger. The auditory nerves, Nervi acustici, form the eighth pair of cranial nerves. The nerve appears on both sides between Flocculus and Pedunculus cerebelli, together with the facial nerve, for which it forms a groove. Both nerves enter the internal auditory meatus 5 the facial nerve passes to the Aquaeductus Fallopiac; the auditory nerve divides into two branches, the larger cochlear branch, N. cochleae, and the smaller vestibular branch, N. vcstibuli. The former passes forwards through the foramina of the Tractus foraminulentus to the Lamina spiralis, and ends in the organ of Corti; the latter divides into several branches, which pass to the Sacculus sphaericus, Sacculus ellipticiis and the three ampullae of the semicircular canals (see Fig. 325).

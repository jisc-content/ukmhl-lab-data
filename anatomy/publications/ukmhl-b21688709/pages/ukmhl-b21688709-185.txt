Topography. 157 211. Topographical Anatomy of the Neck. Contents of the two triangles of the neck, the Trigonum inframaxillare and the Trigonum supraclaviculars, which are formed by the crossing of the M. sterno- cleido-mastoideus with the M, omo-hyoideus. The deep anterior vertebral muscles of the neck (Fig. 210): M. rectus capitis anticus major. Orig.: Transverse processes of the third to the sixth cervical vertebrae. Insert.: Inferior surface of the basilar process of the occipital bone. M. rectus capitis anticus minor. Orig.: Front of the root of the transverse pro- cess of the atlas. Insert.: Inferior surface of the basilar process. (Both flex the head.) M. rectus capitis lateralis. Orig.: Transverse process of the atlas. Insert.: Jugular process of the occipital bone. M. longus colli consists of three separate muscles: a) M. longus colli rectus which extends from the body of the third dorsal vertebra up to the body of the axis (flexor); b) M. obliquus colli (anticus) inferior which arises from the bodies of the second and third dorsal vertebrae, and is inserted into the transverse processes of the fifth to the seventh cervical vertebrae (rotator); c) M. obliquus colli (anticus) superior which arises from the transverse processes of the third and fourth cervical vertebrae and is inserted into the anterior tubercle of the atlas (rotator).

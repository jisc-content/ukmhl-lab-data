125 Cranial Nerves. 469. The Oculomotor, Trochlear and Abducent Nerves. View from above. The third pair of cranial nerves, the oculomoto r, Nervus oculo- motorius, emerges from the Crus cerebri close to the Pons Varolii, runs obliquely forwards and outwards, and becomes imbedded in the upper wall of the cavernous sinus (here it receives some filaments from the cavernous plexus of the sympathetic nerve). It then divides into two branches which enter the orbit through the sphenoidal fissure. The smaller superior division, Ramus superior, supplies the M. levator palpebrae saperioris and the M. rectus superior; the larger inferior, Ramus inferior, divides into three branches for the M. rectus interims, M. rectus inferior and M. obliquus inferior. From the latter, the longest branch, a short thick twig is given off to the ciliary ganglion, forming its inferior root, Radix brevis s. motoria. The fourth, trochlear or pathetic nerve, Nervus trochlearis s. patheticus, is the smallest of the cranial nerves. It arises immediately behind the Corpus quadrigeminum, winds around the Processus cerebelli ad corpus quadrigeminum and the Pcdunculus cerebri, pierces the dura mater behind the posterior clinoid process and is here united with the ophthal- mic division of the fifth nerve. It then enters the orbit through the sphenoidal fissure and passes inwards to the M. obliquus superior. 17*

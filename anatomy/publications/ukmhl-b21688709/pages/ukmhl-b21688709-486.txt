Aorta abdominalis. 218 504. The Branches of the Coeliac Artery. The stomach being turned upwards. The descending ramus of the hepatic artery is called the gastro-duodenal artery; behind the pylorus this artery divides again into two branches: Art. panereatico-duodenalis for the head of the pancreas and the duo- denum ; Art. gastro-epiploica dextra (Art. coronaria ventriculi inferior dextra) run- ning from right to left along the greater curvature of the stomach. Its branches pass to the stomach and great omentum, and it anastomoses with the Art. gastro-epiploica sinistra. c) The splenic, Art. splenica, passes to the left to the spleen and gives off: The Art. gastro-epiploica sinistra (coronaria ventriculi inferior sinistra) and 4â€”6 Vasa brevia to the fundus of the stomach. By the anastomosis of these branches two arches are formed: the Arcus arteriosus ventriculi superior, at the lesser curvature of the stomach, and the Arcus arteriosus ventriculi inferior at the great curvature.

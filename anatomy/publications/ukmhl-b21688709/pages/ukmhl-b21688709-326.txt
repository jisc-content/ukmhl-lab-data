58 Kidneys. 395. The Right Kidney and Supra-renal Capsule. 2/3 natural size. The kidneys, Penes, are situated in the lumbar region at the back part of the abdomen; they have somewhat the shape of a bean; their anterior surfaces are covered by peritoneum, their posterior lie on the Musculi qua- drato-lumborum. The right kidney, placed somewhat lower than the left, is in relation anteriorly with the ascending colon, the left with the descending colon. The internal, concave border presents a fissure, the Hilus s. Porta rents, for the entrance and exit of the renal vessels. They are surrounded by loose areolar tissue containing much fat, C'apsula adiposa, and by a proper fibrous coat, Capsula fibrosa, which forms a thin, smooth investment, closely covering the organ. The surface of the kidney is in the adult entirely smooth, but in the new-born is divided into lobules, Penes lobati (see Fig. 394). On splitting open the kidney by a longitudinal section, it is found to consist of a medullary substance, Substantia mcduttaris s. tubidosa, around which is the reddish-brown cortical substance, Substantia corticalis s. vascidosa s. glomeridosa; the former consists of palish-red masses, the pyramids of Malpighi, 10â€”15 in number, whose apices, directed towards the hilus, are called Papillae renales. The prolongations of the cortical sub- stance between any two pyramids are called columns of Bertini.

Aorta ahdominalis. 223 569. Course and Ramification of the Abdominal Aorta. Specimen from a child. Natural size. 4. The lumbar arteries, Arteriae lumbales, are five in number on each side and arise from the back part of the aorta; they pass out- wards behind the psoas muscle. Each artery divides into a posterior or dorsal branch, which, with its spinal branch is distributed to the spinal cord and its membranes, and an anterior branch for the broad abdominal muscles. If the artery which runs along the lower border of the twelfth rib is counted as an intercostal artery, there are only four lumbar arteries. In front of the fourth lumbar vertebra the abdominal aorta divides into the two common iliac arteries, Arteriae iliacae communes. These pass downwards towards the sacro-iliac symphisis and divide opposite the promontory into the external iliac or crural and the inter- nal iliac or hypogastric arteries. Between both common iliac arteries the Art. sacralis media, which passes down to the coccyx, arises; it gives off lateral branches, and partly supplies the M. psoas magnus, the M. iliacus interims and the rectum.

224 Artefia ilidca interna. 570. Course and Ramification of the Arteries of the Pelvis. The internal iliac artery, Art. iliaca interna s. hypogastrica, extends from the bifurcation of the common iliac artery downwards towards the great sacro-sciatic foramen, where it divides into two large trunks, an anterior and a posterior, which supply the pelvic viscera, gluteal region and the external genital organs. The posterior branches of the internal iliac artery are: a) The ileo-lumbar, Art. ileo-lumbalis, which ascends beneath the psoas muscle, and gives off the iliac branch for the M. iliacus, and the lumbar branch for the MM', psoas and quad/ratus lumborum. b) The lateral sacral, Arteriae sacrales laterales, a superior larger and an inferior smaller for the MM. pyriformis, levator aid and coccygexis. Some of its branches pass through the anterior sacral foramina to the termination of the spinal cord, others through the posterior sacral foramina to the long muscles of the back.

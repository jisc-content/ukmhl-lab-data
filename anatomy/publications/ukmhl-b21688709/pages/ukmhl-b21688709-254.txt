The retina, expansion of the optic nerve, is the innermost layer of the eye- ball, the real organ of vision. The place where the optic nerve pierces the sclerotic and choroid coats, is marked by an eminence, the Colli- culus sen Papilla nervi optici; here the bloodvessels, Art. and Vena centralis retinae, find their entrance and exit. At the point of entrance of the optic nerve the power of vision is absent (blind spot), and this part lies a little to the inner side of the point of most perfect vision. This latter point has a slight central depression, Fovea centralis; in the eye of the cadaver it is seen as a yellow spot, Macula hdea, and only there it is connec- ted by two eminences, Plicae centrales, with the papilla. The layers of the retina (see Fig. 307) are distinct up to the region of the Ora serrata; from here on only the struc- tureless Memhrana limitans, lying between the layer of rods and cones andinnermost layer of the choroid, remains. The vitreous body, Corpus vitreum, occupies the greater portion of the eyeball; it is covered by a thin glassy membrane, the Hyaloidea, which, in front, where it pas- ses forwards to the margin of the crystaline lens, is known as the Zonula Zinnii. Between the anterior and posterior fibres of the zonula is the Canalis Petit/' (see Fig. 301).

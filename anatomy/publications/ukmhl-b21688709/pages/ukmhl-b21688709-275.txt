Soft Palate. 7 332, The Muscles of the Soft Palate; view from before. The M. azygos uvulae arises from the posterior nasal spine of the palate bone, Spina palatum, and descends in the middle line of the uvula to its apex. It consists of two slips, which lie close together. The MM. levatores veli palatini (M. petro-salpingo-staphylinus) arise from the under surface of the petrous portion of the temporal bone and the cartilage of the Eustachian tube on both sides; passing to the middle line of the uvula, they partly blend with the M. azygos, and partly with each other. The MM. tensores palati (M. spheno-salpingo-staphylinus) are flat muscles, which arise from the spine of the sphenoid and the cartilage of the Eustachian tube, and terminate in broad tendons which wind around the hamular process; they form together the broad aponeurosis of the soft palate.

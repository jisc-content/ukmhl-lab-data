Knee-Joint. 131 181. The Alar Ligaments, Ligamenta alarm, of the Right Knee-Joint. The synovial membrane of the knee-joint sends off, on each side of the patella, two folds (Ligamenta alaria), which are well supplied with fat, and end in a thin ligamentous band, which runs from the place of insertion of the anterior crucial ligament to the intercondylar fossa of the femur â€” Ligamentum mucosum. The alar ligaments divide (after Hyrtl] the space in front of the crucial ligaments into three entirely separate ligamentous cavities.

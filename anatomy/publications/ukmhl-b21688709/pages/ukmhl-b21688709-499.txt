231 Arteria cruralis. b) The circumflex iliac artery, Art. cir- cumflexa ilei (see Fig. 569) runs obliquely upwards and outwards along the crest of the ilium. It supplies the muscles which arise from the crest of the ilium. The femoral ar- tery gives off the fol- lowing branches: 1. Inguinal, Hamuli inguinales. 2. Superficial epi- gastric, Art. epigastrica superficialis, frequently also a superficial circum- flex iliac, Art. circum- flexa ilei superficialis, both for the integument. 3. External pudic, Arteriae pudendae externae, a superficial and a deep, pass transversely inwards; the deep gives off the anterior scro- tal or labial arteries. 4. Deep femoral, Arteria profunda femoris, nearly equal in size to the superficial femoral, sup- plies all the nruscles of the thigh. It arises 1â€”14/2 in- ches below Poup art's ligament, passes inwards and backwards between the MM. adductor longus and brevis, and finally perforates the M. adductor magnus. It gives off t w o circumflex arteries: the internal, Art. cir- cumfte.va femoris interna, and the external, Art. circumflexa femoris externa. The internal winds back- wards around the lesser trochanter and after ha- ving supplied the muscles at the inner side of the thigh, divides into an ascending and a des- cending branch.

Small Intestine. 27 355. Termination of the Ileum into the Coecum, in an Adult. i/2 nat. size of an inflated and dried intestine, the anterior wall being partially removed. 356. Termination of the Ileum into the Coecum, in a Foetus of 7 months. Natural size of an inflated and dried in- testine, the posterior wall being partially removed. The mucous membrane of the small intestine contains transverse f(olds, Valvulae conniventes Kerkringii, which begin at the descending portion of the duodenum and are thence present throughout the rest of the small intestine; in the duodenum they are largest and most numerous, and from there they diminish gradually in size and number. In the descending portion of the duodenum, near the inner margin of the posterior wall, is a vertical projection, Plica longitudinalis, formed by tlie mucous membrane raised up by the united Ductus choledochus and pancreaticus, before they open into the intestine. Where the ileum opens into the coecum, the mucous membrane forms the ileo- coecal valve, Valvula coli, which consists of two folds. Throughout the whole extent of the mucous membrane of the small intestine there are numerous minute processes, Villi intestinalcs; each villus has abundant bloodvessels and one or more lymphatic vessels, being supported and held together by retiform lymphoid tissue. 4*

Cranial Nerves. 124 V N. TRIGEMIK. 468. The Olfactory and Optic Nerves. View from above. The second pair of cranial nerves is the optic nerve, Nervus opticus; under the name of optic tract, Tractus opticus, it winds obliquely across the under surface of the Crus cerebri, from without inwards and downwards, converging with the nerve of the opposite side, to form with it in front of the Tuber cinereum the chiasm a or optic commis- sure. The greater number of the fibres of the two nerves decussate in the commissure, but some are continued from the tract to the nerve of the same side. The optic nerves, as they arise from the chiasma, are rounded cords, diverging from each other; each passes through the cor- responding optic foramen of the sphenoid bone to the orbit, and continues its oblique course, inclining at the same time somewhat downwards, to the eyeball, which it enters on its posterior aspect somewhat internal to its center. Here the nerve perforates the sclerotic and choroid coats and terminates by expanding in the retina. The fibrous layer of the retina is formed by the fibres of the optic nerve (see Fig. 307). The optic nerve is surrounded by a sheath from the dura mater, which finally becomes blended with the texture of the sclerotic.

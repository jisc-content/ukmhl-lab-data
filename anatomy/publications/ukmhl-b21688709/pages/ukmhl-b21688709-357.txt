89 Fascia pelvis. 431. Anterior Surface of the Symphisis, after removal of the Corpora cavernosa penis. The deep perineal fascia, Fascia periiiei profunda, is stretched across the subpubic arch on the deep surface of the crura of the penis and bull) of the urethra. It consists of two layers, an anterior and a p o s t e r i o r; the anterior is attached on each side to the rami of the pubis and ischium, while posteriorly it becomes connected with the posterior layer. This layer is perforated by the urethra about an inch below the symphisis. The posterior layer consists of right and left lateral halves, which are separated in the middle line by the urethra close to the neck of the prostate. The layer is superficial to the anterior fibres of the Levator am muscle, which lie between it and the recto-vesical fascia, and is connected with a thin web of areolar tissue, which extends back- wards on the surface of the M. Levator ami, and is distinguished as the anal fascia. Heitzma nn, Atlas. II. 12

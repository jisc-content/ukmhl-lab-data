377. Larynx after Removal of the Left Thyroid Lamella, lateral view. The muscles of the larynx (all in pairs) are: 1. At the external portion of the larynx: a) M. crico-tJiyroideus (see Fig. 373) arises from the front and lateral part of the cricoid cartilage and running obliquely upwards, is inserted into the lower border of the thyroid cartilage. Produces tension of the vocal cords. b) M. crico-arytaenoideus posticus arises from a depression on the corresponding half of the posterior surface of the cricoid cartilage, and passing outwards and upwards, is inserted into the muscular process of the arytenoid cartilage. Eotates this cartilage and opens the glottis. c) M. crico-arytaenoideus lateralis arises from the upper border of the side of the cricoid cartilage, covered by the lamella of the thyroid cartilage; passing obliquely backwards and upwards, it is inserted into the muscular process. Antagonist of the former. d) MM. arytaenoidei transversi et ohliqui (see Fig. 378) pass trans- versely and obliquely, from one arytenoid cartilage to the other, being inserted into its posterior concave surface. Approximate the vocal cords and narrow the opening of the glottis. 2. At the inner surface of the larynx: a) M. thyro-arytaenoideus lies parallel with the outer side of the true vocal cord; it arises from the inner surface of the thyroid cartilage, and is inserted into the vocal process and anterior border of the arytenoid carti- lage. Narrows the glottis. b) M. thyreo-epiylotticus and M. ary-epiglotticus between the layers of the Lig. ary-epiglotticum, passingfrom the thyroid and arytenoid cartilages to the epiglottis.

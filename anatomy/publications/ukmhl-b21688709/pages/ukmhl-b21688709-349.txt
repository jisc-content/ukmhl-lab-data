Female Organs of Generation. 81 421. The Right Mammary Gland during Lactation. 2/3 natural size. The mammary glands or Mammae, lie upon the Pcctorcdis major muscle, between the third and sixth ribs; they are separated from each other by the bosom, Sinus. They are hemispherical eminences, presenting just below the center a small conical prominence, the n i p p 1 e, Papilla s. Mamilla. The nipple is surrounded by the areola, which has a colored tint and is covered with numerous tubercles; at the tip of the nipple the excretory ducts of the mammae open, at the surface of the areola, the Glandulae lactiferae dberrantes. — The mamma is formed of from 16—24 lobes held together by fibrous or areolar tissue, and having adi- pose tissue penetrating between them; each lobe is composed of a number of smaller lobes, and these again of smaller and smaller lobules; the smallest lobules consist of a cluster of rounded vesicles, which open into the smal- lest branches of the lactiferous ducts. The excretory ducts of the lobules unite to form a larger Ductus lactiferus s. galactopliorus, of which each corresponds to one of the lobes. These ducts converge towards the areola, beneath which they become considerably dilated, especially during lactation, so as to form sinuses, Sinus lactei; then they again become reduced in size, and proceed without communicating with each other, to the summit of the nipple, where they open by separate orifices.

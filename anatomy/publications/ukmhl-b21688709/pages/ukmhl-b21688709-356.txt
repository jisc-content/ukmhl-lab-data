88 Fascia pelvis. 430. The Ligaments of the Visceral Layer of the Fascia pelvis. View of the Rami of the Ischium and the Bladder from behind. The visceral layer of the pelvic fascia (recto-vesical fascia), is attached anteriorly to the back of the pubis, from which it is separated by the origin of the M. levator ani; laterally it springs from the obturator fascia along a curved line passing from the upper part of the obturator foramen to the ischial spine. Lying upon the upper surface of the Levator ani, the visceral layer, which forms a fibrous partition comjjletely separating the pelvic cavity above from the perineal space below, passes in front to the jirostata and anterior surface of the bladder, as Ligamenta pubo-prostatica (better pubo-vesicalia) lateralia; in the middle portion it passes to the prostate, as Ligamenta ischio-prostatica, then it enters between the base of the bladder and rectum as Fascia recto- vesicalis; finally in the posterior portion it reaches the outer surface of the rectum as a thin layer.

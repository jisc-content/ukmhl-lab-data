116 Cerebrum and Cerebellum. 457, Sagittal Median Section of the Cerebrum, Cerebellum and Medulla Oblongata. % natural size. In the Lamina cinerea white, transverse fibres, Chordae acustlcae, are seen (see Fig. 456), and along the clavae two bands, Taeniae fossae rhomboideae. The posterior angle of the Fovea rhomboidea is called Calamus scriptorius; the anterior angle (covered by the anterior medullary velum) communicates through the Aquaedudus Sylvii with the third ventricle. The lateral angles of the Fossa rhomboidea form the lateral recesses, Pecessus laterales (see Fig. 456). The Lamina cinerea of the Fovea rhom- boidea presents at the place of exit of the Processus cercbcUi ad Corpus quadrigeminum an intensely dark color â€” Locus caeruleus. The fourth ventricle is closed jiosteriorly by the pia mater as Tela choroidea inferior, which, being fixed at the Taeniae fossae rhomboideae, the peduncles of the flocculus and the posterior medullary velum, forms the Plexus choroidals ventriculi quarti. In transverse section of the hemispheres of the cerebellum the Nucleus dentatus s. Corpus rhomboideum is seen in front; it is a white nucleus with dentated borders.

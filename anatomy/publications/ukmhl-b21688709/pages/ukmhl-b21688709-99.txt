Bones of the Trunk. 71 Titltemilum. 91. The Second Rib, superior view. At the place where the neck, Collwm, is continued into the shaft, there is on every rib the tuberosity or tubercle, Tuberculum costae, covered with cartilage, for articulation with the articular surface of the transverse process of the lower of the two vertebrae with which the rib is connected. At the back jDart of the external surface is a rough line, the angle, Angulus costae (Fig. 89); it is well developed only from the third to the tenth ribs, but coincides with the tubercle in the first and second ribs. The second rib has at its external surface a rough prominence for the attachment of the serratus magnus muscle, M. serratus aiiticus major.

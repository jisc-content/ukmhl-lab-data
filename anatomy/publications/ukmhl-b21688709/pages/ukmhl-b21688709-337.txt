The cutaneous pouch, which contains the testes and spermatic cords, is called scrotum; it is divided by a median external raphe into two lateral halves; the cavity of the scrotum is divided into two, by the Septum scroti. Beneath the integument is the Tunica dartos, formed of unstriped muscular fibres, which is continuous with the superficial fascia of the groin, perinaeum and inner side of the thighs. The seminal vesicles, Vesiculae seminales, are two lobulated membranous pouches at the base of the bladder behind the prostata, each having an upper obtuse and a lower pointed extremity, which latter unites with the corresponding Vas deferens, to form with it the ejaculatory duct. The ejaculatory ducts, Ductus ejaculatorii, run between the prostate gland and posterior wall of the prostatic portion of the urethra forwards and downwards, and end in the urethra at the Caput gaUinaginis. The prostate gland, Prostata, has the form of a chestnut and encloses the first part of the urethra in such a manner, that the greater part of the gland lies behind the urethra. The posterior surface of the prostate is divided by two slight ridges into three lobes.

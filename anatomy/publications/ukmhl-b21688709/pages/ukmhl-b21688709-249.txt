Organ of Vision. 221 298. The Muscles of the Eye, from the outside. M. rectus interims, M. rectus externus, M. rectus superior, M. rectus inferior arise in the vicinity of the sheath of the optic nerve, run forwards, and are inserted by tendinous expansions at a distance of from 2 to 3 lines from the margin of the cornea into the sclerotica. The M. rectus externus arises by two heads. M. obliquus superior s. M. trochlearis is placed at the upper and inner side of the orbit; its tendon passes through a fibro- cartilaginous ring or pulley, Trochlea, which is attached to the trochlear fossa, s. Hamulus trochlearis of the frontal bone, and passing outwards and backwards is inser- ted into the sclerotic coat. M. obliquus inferior arises at the inner end of the lower margin of the orbit; it passes outwards, upwards and backwards and is inserted into the sclerotic coat.

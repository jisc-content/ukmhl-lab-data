76 Female Organs of Generation. 415. Generative Organs of a New-Born Girl. The uterus laid open in the posterior median line, the vagina in the left lateral line. Natural size. The womb, Uterus, is a hollow, muscular organ, situated between the rectum and urinary bladder; it is pear-shaped, flattened from before backwards. The fundus is the upper broad extremity of the organ; the body, Corpus, gradually narrows as it extends from the fundus to the neck, Cervix s. Collum; the junction of the body and neck is, especially in younger persons, marked by a constriction. The cervix projects into the upper end of the vagina, and this projecting portion is called the vaginal part, Porlio vaginalis uteri. The broad 1 i g a- m e n t s, IAgamenta lata, pass from the sides of the uterus to the lateral walls of the pelvis; the round ligaments, Ligamenta rotunda, con- tinuations of the uterus substance, are enclosed in the anterior layer of the broad ligaments (see Fig. 412). The round ligaments pass through the inguinal canal to the fore part of the pubic symphisis, and become lost in the Labia majora. Besides the broad ligaments, the peritoneum forms ligaments between the bladder and uterus, the two anterior, liga- menta vesico-uterina, and between the rectum and uterus, the two posterior, Ligamenta recto-uterina.

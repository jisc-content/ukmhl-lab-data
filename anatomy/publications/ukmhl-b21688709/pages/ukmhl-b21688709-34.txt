Bones, of the Cranium. 4. Sphenoid Bone, Os sphenoideum, from above. The sphenoid bone is divided into: 1. the body, 2. the wings; the latter form 3 pairs: a) the lesser wings, Alae minor es; b) the greater wings, Alae rnagnae, and c) the wing like or pterygoid processes, Processus pterygoidei. Body. On the upper surface the pituitary fossa or Sella turcica (for the Hypophysis cerebri); its posterior wall, the Dorsum sellae or ephippii, with the posterior clinoid processes, Processus clinoidei postici. The posterior surface of the Dorsum sellae is continuous with the basilar groove of the occipital bone-Clivus. In front of the pituitary fossa the Tuberculum ephippii; on both sides of this the middle clinoid processes. On the lateral surfaces of the body the cavernous groove, Sulcus caroticus (for the Carotis) with the Lingula. Lesser wings; each arises from the body by 2 roots, between which is the optic foramen; the ends looking toward the Dorsum sellae. form the anterior clinoid processes, Processus clinoidei anteriores. Greater wings each with three surfaces and three borders. The cerebral surface, Svperfieies cerebralis, with the furrow for the middle meningeal artery and vein. The inner segment of the upper border forms with the lower surface of the lesser wing the sphenoidal fissure, Fissura sphenoidale (Fiss. orbitalis superior). The posterior border is prolonged into the spinous process, Spina angidaris. The Foramen rotundum (for the 2nd di\ 'ision of the V. pair of cranial nerves); the Foramen ovale (for the 3rd division of the V. pair); the Foramen spinosum (for the middle meningeal artery).

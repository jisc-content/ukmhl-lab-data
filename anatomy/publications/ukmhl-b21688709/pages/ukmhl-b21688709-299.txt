31 Liver, .300. The Liver, Hepar. View from above. The liver lies in the right hypochondrium and extends across into the left. Its anterior border, thin and sharp, is marked by a deep notch for the attachment of the Ligamentum suspensorium (broad, falciform ligament); its posterior rounded border is higher than the anterior; the right border is also rounded, the left, sharp, lies in front of the cardia of the stomach. The upper surface is convex and exactly moulded to the under surface of the diaphragm; it is marked off into a large right and a small left portion by the line of attachment of the suspensory ligament. The under surface of the liver (see Fig. 361) is divided by four fissures into five lobes; the fissures are: the fissure for the gall- bladder, the longitudinal fissure (divided into umbilical fissure and fissure for the Ductus venosus), the transverse fissure and the fissure for the inferior Vena cava. To the right of the fissure for the gall-bladder is the right lobe of the liver, to the left of the longitudinal fissure the left lobe; in front of the transverse fissure is the Lobulus quadratus, behind it the Lobulus Spigelii with the conical Tuberculum papillare, and with a process, the Tuberculum caudatum s. Lobulus caudatus) which extends to the under surface of the right lobe.

150 Spinal Ni 494. The Cutaneous Nerves of the Upper Extremity, at the flexor surface. The infraclavicular por- tion of the brachial plexus sur- rounds the subclavian (axillary) artery with three cords, at the outer, inner and posterior sides. It forms the following branches : 1. Lesser internal cu- taneous, N. cutaneus bracliii in- terims, arises from the inner cord, passes down behind the axillary vein, communicates with a branch of the second dorsal nerve, the inter c osto - humeral, pierces the fascia of the upper arm at the inner surface, and is distributed to the integument of the arm down to the elbow-joint. 2. Internal cutaneous, N. cutaneus brachii medius arises from the inner cord, runs on the in- ner side of the axillary, then the ba- silic vein, pierces with the latter the fascia of the upper arm, and divides into two branches, an an- terior, i?. cutaneus palmaris, and a posterior, E. cutaneus ulnar is. The anterior descends on the an- terior surface of the ulnar side of the forearm, distributing filaments to the integument as far as the wrist, the posterior passes down- wards on the inner side of the basilic vein at the ulnar side of the forearm and communicates with the dorsal branch of the ulnar nerve; it distributes fila- ments to the integument on the inner and posterior surfaces of the forearm.

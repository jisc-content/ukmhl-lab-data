Cerebrum. 104 444. Horizontal Section of the Cerebrum, the Left Lateral Ventricle being completely opened. 2/3 natural size. The Corpus callosum and Fornix tricuspidalis, which lies below it, form the roof of the third ventricle. Upon lifting up of the Corpus callosum, the triangular Septum luciclum is found between its anterior half and the fornix ; it is a thin, semi-transparent septum, placed between the anterior cornua of the two lateral ventricles; it is composed of two lamina having an interval between them, the fifth ventricle or Ventriculus scptipellucidi. The posterior half of the Corpus callosum is in immediate contact with the fornix. The Fornix is an arched longitudinal white commissure lying between the two optic thalami; it consists of two lateral halves, which are separated from each other in front and behind, forming the anterior and posterior pillars or crura. The anterior pillars, Crura anteriora (Columnac) fornicis, cylindrical in form, can be traced downwards in front of the optic thalami, curve backwards to the Corpora albicantia s. Corpora mammillaria, and from there they can be traced upwards again into the substance of the optic tha- lami. The interval between the anterior pillar of the fornix and the anterior part of the optic thalamus on each side, is called the Foramen Monroi.

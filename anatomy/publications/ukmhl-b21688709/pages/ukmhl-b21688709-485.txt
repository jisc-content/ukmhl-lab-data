Aorta abdominalls. 217 563. The Branches of the Coeliac Axis. View after removal of the Lesser Omentum. To the right of the cardia, the coeliac axis divides into three branches: a) The gastric, Art. coronaria ventriculi superior sinistra, which runs in the lesser curvature of the stomach from left to right; its branches anastomose at the anterior and posterior surfaces of the stomach with the Art. coronaria superior dextra, the Art. coronariae inferiores and the Vasa brevia. b) The hepatic, Art. hepatica, which runs in the Lig. hepato- duodenal?, sends off the Art. coronaria superior dextra to the lesser curvature of the stomach (a branch of this is the pyloric artery) and then divides into an ascending and a descending branch. â€” The ascen- ding branch is the Art. hepatica propria, which, dividing into two bran- ches, enters the porta of the liver; its right branch gives off the cystic artery, supplying the gall-bladder, and passes into the right lobe of the liver; the left branch passes to the left lobe.

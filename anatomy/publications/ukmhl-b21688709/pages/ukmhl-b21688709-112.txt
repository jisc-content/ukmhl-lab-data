Sternoclavicular Articulation 84 105. The Stemo-Clavicular Articulation, Articulatio sterno-clavicularis. The fibrous capsule of this articulation is especially strong on the anterior surface; the strengthening band is known as the Ligamentum stcrno-claviculare; the articular cavity has interposed an inter articular fibro-cartilage, whose circumference is closely connected with the fibrous capsule. As strengthening ligaments serve: the Ldgamentum inter- claviculare passing between both clavicles, and the Ligamentum costo-clavi- cularc passing from the cartilage of the first rib to the under rough sur- face of the sternal end of the clavicle.

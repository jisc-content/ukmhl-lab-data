21 Bones of the Face. 23. Right Superior Maxillary Bone, Maxilla superior, from* the outside. The superior maxillary bone is divided into the body and 4 processes, the nasal process, Processus nasalis seu frontalis, the malar or zygomatic process, Processus zygomaticus, the palatine process, Processus palatums, and the alveolar process, Processus alveolaris. The body has 3 surfaces: the external or facial surface, Superficies facialis, the superior or orbital surface, Superficies orbi- talis, and the internal or nasal surface, Superficies nasalis. The external surface is divided into an anterior or facial and a posterior or zygomatic portion; the anterior concave has at its upper border the infraorbital foramen, and below this the canine fossa, Fovea canina; the posterior convex is limited posteriorly by the maxillary tuberosity, Tuberositas maxillaris, on which are foramina, Foramina inaxillaria superiora, leading to vessel- and nerve canals (posterior dental canals). The orbital surface forms with its anterior border a part of the Margo infraorbitalis; the posterior border forms with the inferior border of the orbital surface of the great wing of the sphenoid the Fissura orbitalis inferior (spheno- maxillary fissure); from this a furrow, which changes in its course to a canal, the infraorbital canal, leads to the infraorbital foramen.

216 Aorta abdominalis. 562. Course and Ramification of the Abdominal Aorta. The abdominal aorta, Aorta abdominalis, gives off a large number of branches. From its anterior aspect three single arteries arise, the others arise from its lateral aspect. The single arteries are: 1. The coeliac artery or axis, Art. codiaca; it is a short thick trunk, which arises from the aorta opposite the margin of the diaphragm; it passes above the upper border of the pancreas, a little to the left, and immediately gives off two phrenic arteries. These ramify in the suprarenal capsules, and in the lumbar and costal portions of the diaphragm, and anastomose with each other, as well as with the intercostal arteries (from the thoracic aorta) and the musculo-phrenic (from the internal mammary).

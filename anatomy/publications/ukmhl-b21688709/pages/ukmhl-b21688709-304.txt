36 Pancreas. .'S66. Pancreas, with Injected, Bifurcated Excretory Duct. View from behind, V, natural size. The pancreas lies behind the stomach, upon the lumbar portion of the diaphragm (see Fig. 351); the left extremity or tail, Cauda, is in contact with the spleen, while the right larger end, the head,' Caput, is embraced by the curvature of the duodenum. Its excretory duct, the Ductus pancreaticus s. Wirsungianus, about the size of a quill, extends trans- versely from left to right through the substance of the pancreas, unites with the Ductus communis clioledochus, and opens with it in the duo- denum ; rarely each duct has a separate opening. Often the pancreatic duct is bifurcated; then the lower branch unites with the common bile- duct, and the upper (Ductus Santorini) opens separately 1 inch or l'/2 inches above the lower. The spleen, Lien s. Splen (see Fig. 351 and 362) is a highly vascular gland, lying in the left hypochondrium, near the fundus of the stomach. The external and upper surface is in relation with the concave surface of the Pars costalis of the diaphragm, the inner surface, containing the hilus, Hilus lienis, is in relation in front with the stomach, behind with the left crus of the diaphragm; the anterior border is often slightly notched, the posterior, rounded. The peritoneal covering is con- nected with that of the stomach by means of the Lig. gastro-lienale, with that of the diaphragm by means of the Lig. phrenico-lienale; the spleen is also invested with a Tunica propria, which is reflected into the interior of the spleen in the form of large Trabeculac; in the interstices of the connective tissue frame work is the red pulp, Pidpa lienis.

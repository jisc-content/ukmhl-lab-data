M. extensor digitorum communis (see Fig. 240, 243); it arises from the exter- nal condyle of the humerus and the Fascia antibrachii, being inserted by four tendons at the dorsum of the first phalanges into the aponeurosis of the second to the fifth fingers. The aponeurosis divides into three slips, of which the middle is inserted into the II. phalanx, the two lateral into the lateral borders of the III. phalanx. M. extensor digiti minimi (Fig. 240, 243) has the same origin as the preceding muscle; the tendon of insertion is united with the fourth tendon of the Extensor communis. M. extensor carpi ulnaris s. ulnaris exter- nus (Fig. 240) arises from the external condyle of the humerus and the Fascia antibrachii, and is inserted into the base of the metacarpal bone of the little finger. (Extensor and abductor of the hand.) M. extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis s. abductor potticis longus arises from the middle portion of the posterior surface of the ulna, the outer surface of the interosseous liga- ment and the radius; it is inserted into the base of the metacarpal bone of the thumb. M. extensor primi internodii pollicis s. extensor pollicis brevis has the same origin as the preceding, and is inserted into the dorsal aponeurosis of the first phalanx of the thumb (Fig. 243). M. extensor secundi internodii jjoffic/s s. extensor pollicis longus arises from the crest of the ulna and the interosseous membrane, and is inserted into the dorsal aponeurosis of the second phalanx of the thumb (Fig.243). M. extensor indicis s. indicator arises from the crest and outer surface of the ulna; it unites with the tendon of the index finger of tbe M. extensor digitorum communis (Fig. 243).

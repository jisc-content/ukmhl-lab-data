8 Soft Palate. 333. The Muscles of the Soft Palate; view from behind. The MM. palato-glossi occupy the anterior pillars of the fauces; they are narrow muscles, which, in the soft palate blend with each other, and by their contraction narrow the isthmus of the fauces; they are also called Constrictores isthmi faucium. The MM. palato-jpJia/ryngei occupy the posterior pillars of the fauces; they arise in the aponeurosis of the M. tensor pcdati, consisting of two layers and are inserted into the posterior border of the thyroid cartilage and into the fibrous layer of the lower part of the pharynx, reaching as far as, or even crossing, the middle line behind.

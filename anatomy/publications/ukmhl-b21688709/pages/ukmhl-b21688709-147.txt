Bones of the Lower Extremity. 119 165. The Right Thigh Boiie, Os femoriS, from before. The upper e x t r e m i t y of the femur consists of a head, Caput femoris, which is connected to the shaft by means of a neck, and has a small depression, Foveola, for the insertion of the Lag. teres. At the place where the neck is continued into the shaft, are the two trochanters, the great external, Trochanter major, and the lesser inter- nal, Trochanter minor; these are connected by the two inter- trochanteric lines, the Linea im.tertrochante.rica anterior and pos- terior. At the internal surface of the great trochanter lies the digi- tal or trochanteric fossa, Fossa trochanterica (Fig. 166). The Linea asptra femoris ("Fig. 166) extends along the posterior surface of the shaft; it presents two lips, Labia. The lower extremity presents two condyles, Condy- lus externus and Conclylus interims, each of which has a tuberosity. The condyles are separated posteriorly by the intercondyloid notch or Fossa poplitca (Fig. 166). The femur articulates with three bones: the Os innominatum, tibia and patella.

The iris consists of muscular and connective tissue, besides numerous vessels and nerves; its inner edge, Margo papillaris, forms the margin of the pupil, Piipilla; between it and the cornea is the anterior cham- ber of the eye, between it and the lense the posterior chamber; both chambers are filled with the aqueous humor. The outer margin of the iris, Margo ciliaris, is a direct continuation of the Corpus ciliare and is connected with the Membrana Dcscemetii hy means of the Ligamen- tum pectinatum (see Fig. 303). The structure of the iris is seen from Fig. 303; of its muscles the circular fibres, Sphincter pypittae, surround the margin of the pupil, while the radiating fibres, Dilatator pupillae, arise from the margin of the cornea.

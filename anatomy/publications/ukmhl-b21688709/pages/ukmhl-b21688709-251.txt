223 Organ of Vision. 301. Section of the Eyeball. Magn. = 4. After Ferdinand Arlt sen. The choroid and iris form the second layer of the eyeball. The former lies on the inner surface of the sclerotic; its outer pigmented connective tissue layer is similar to the Lamina fusca of the sclerotic; the middle layer of the choroid is formed by the bloodvessels, whose net- work of capillaries was called Lamina Buyschii; the inner surface, which is smooth, is covered by the hexagonal pigmented cells of the retina — Tapetum nigrum. At the anterior margin of the sclerotic, the choroid becomes thickened, forming the Corpus ciliare. The superficial layer of the ciliary body is the Musculus ciliaris s. Tensor chorioideae (see Fig. 303), (meridional and radiating fibres); the deep layer, the Corona ciliaris, a circle of from 70—85 folds, each of which is called ciliary process, Processus ciliaris. The indented border between the folded and smooth part of the choroid is the Ora serrata.

Arteria brachialis. 207 The brachial artery. Art. brachialis, extends from the lower border of the teres major muscle to about half an inch below the bend of the elbow, where it divides into the radial and ulnar. It lies in the Sulcus bicipitalis interims, the median nerve at its outer, the ulnar nerve at its inner side in the upper third of the humerus; further clown the two Venae brachiales are in close con- tact with it. At the bend of the elbow it passes below the Lacertus fibrosus of the tendon of the M. biceps. Besides its muscular branches which are given off from it at different parts of its course, its branches are: a) The profunda or supe- rior profunda, Art. profunda brachii, passes between the internal and long heads of the triceps, in connection with the musculo-spiral (radial) nerve, to the outer side of the upper arm, supplies the M. tri- ceps, then the humerus by means of a nutrient artery, pierces the external intermuscular septum, and descends to the elbow where it is called Art. collatcralis radialis. One terminal branch anastomoses with the recurrent branch of the radial, the other with the Art. anastomotica magna. b) The inferior profunda, also called Art. collatcralis ulnaris superior, arises about the middle of the arm and descends in company with the ulnar nerve; it supplies the M. brachialis anticus and M. triceps and anastomoses with the posterior recur- rent branch of the ulnar. c) The Anastomotica magna or Art. collcderalis ulnaris inferior, passes to- wards the internal condyle, supplies the superficial muscles arising from it, and anastomoses with the anterior recurrent branch of the ulnar, and, after passing behind the humerus, with the superior profunda artery. 551.

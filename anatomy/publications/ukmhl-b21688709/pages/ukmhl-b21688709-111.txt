Bones of the Upper Extremity. 83 104. The Left Shoulder-Blade, Scapula, from behind. The posterior surface of the scapula is divided by the spine, Spina scapulae, into the supra- and infraspinous fossae, Fossa supra- et, infra- spinata. The spine is continued into the broad acromion process, which over- hangs the glenoid cavity, and is connected by an articular facet with the clavicle. The second process is the coracoid process, Processus coracoideus, which arises between the Incisura scapulae and Cavitas glenoidalis, over which latter it curves forwards and outwards. The scapula articulates with the clavicle and the humerus. 11*

Spinal Nerves. 152 496. The Nerves at the Palmar Side of the Hand ficial, lying between the tendons of the MM. flexor digitorum sublimis and flexor carpi radialis. It then passes with the tendons of the flexor sublimis beneath the annular ligament into the palm of the hand, where it divides into four digital branches, Nervi digitorum volares. The first supplies the small muscles of the thumb and the skin on its radial side; the other three supply the first three MM. lumbricales, and the inte- gument on the contiguous sides of the thumb, and the second, third and fourth fingers. One branch communicates with the volar branch of the ulnar nerve. In the upper arm the median nerve has no branches; in the forearm: muscular branches for the superficial flexor muscles (except M. flexor carpi ulnaris); a communicating branch for the external cutaneous nerve; also the anterior or internal interosseous, N. mterosseus interims, which passes down to the M. pronator quadratics; finally a palmar cutaneous branch, N. cutaneus antibrachii palmaris (see Fig. 494).

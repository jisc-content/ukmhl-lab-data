Bones of the Face. 25 27. Right Superior Maxillary Bone, Maxilla superior, from the inner side, with the articulations of the bones. The nasal or internal surface of the body of the superior maxilla shows the opening of the antrum of High more, which is partly closed by the ethmoid, the inferior turbinated and the palate bones; the outer border of the nasal surface articulates with the per- pendicular plate of the palate bone. The palatine process articulates at its inner border with the palatine process of the opposite superior maxilla; with the anterior half of the Crista nasalis the vomer articulates. The Processus alveolaris carries 8 teeth (Fig. 25). The superior maxilla therefore articulates with 9 bones: 2 cranial bones, the frontal and ethmoid, and 7 facial bones, the nasal, malar, lachrymal, palate, inferior turbinated, vomer and with the superior maxilla of the other side.

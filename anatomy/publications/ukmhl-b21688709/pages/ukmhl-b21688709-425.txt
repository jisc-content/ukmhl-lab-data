157 Spinal Nerves. 501. The Cutaneous Nerves at the Ante- rior Surface of the Lower Extremity. Of the five lumbar ner- ves, Nervi lumbales, the first leaves the intervertebral fora- men between first and second lumbar vertebrae, the last be- tween fifth lumbar and base of the sacrum. The p o s t e r i o r, smaller branches supply the fol- lowing muscles: Erector spinae, Inter transver sales, Mvltifidus spi- nae and Inter spinalcs, and the skin of the lumbar and gluteal regions. The anterior, larger branches form the lumbar plexus, Plexus lumbalis, which gives off the following branches: 1. Ileo-hypogastric, N. ileo - hypogastrics, mixed nerve, arises from the first lumbar nerve, and supplies the MM. transversus abdominis and obliquus interims. Between trans- versalis and internal oblique muscles it divides into two branches, the iliac, R. iliacus, to the integument of the glu- teal region, and the hypo- gastric, i?. hypogastrics, to the hypogastric region. 2. Ileo-inguinal, N. ileo- inguinalis, sensory, also arises from the first lumbar nerve, per- forates the M. transversus ab- dominis above Poupart's liga- ment, passes into the inguinal canal and terminates in the in- tegument of the scrotum and upper and inner part of the thigh in the male, and in the labium in the female, with the Nervi scrotales et labiales ante- mi.

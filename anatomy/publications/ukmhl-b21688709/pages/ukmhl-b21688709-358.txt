90 Topography. 432. Frontal Section through the Pelvis of a Child. Semi-diagrammatic, for demonstration of the Pelvic Fasciae. Nat. size. The superficial perinaeal fascia can also be divided into two layers. The superficial layer is thick, loose, areolar in texture, and contains much adipose tissue in its meshes; it is continuous with the Tunica dartos of the scrotum; the deep layer is a thin layer, free from fat, which covers the M. ischio- and bulbo-cavernosus and the M. transversus perinei superficialis; it is attached to the crus penis and becomes the Fascia penis (see Fig. 424). The covering of the two MM. levatores ani by the Fascia pelvis and Fascia perinei profunda, their direction, as well as their relation to the Cavum iscliio-rcctalc, which is rich in fat, is demonstrated in the above figure.

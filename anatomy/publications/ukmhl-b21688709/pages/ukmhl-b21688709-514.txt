Veins. 246 596. The Vena azygos and Vena hemiazygos. (Semi-diagrammatic.) The veins of the wall of the thorax unite to form the V. azygos. The right azy- gos vein commences oppo- site the I. or II. lumbar vertebra from the Plexus venosus lumbalis, enters the thorax through the aortic opening in the diaphragm and passes along the right side of the vertebral column to the III. dorsal vertebra, where it arches forwards over the root of the right lung and terminates in the superior V. cava. It receives 9 or 10 lower intercostal veins, several oesopha- geal, mediastinal and vertebral veins. The left, small azygos vein or F. hemiazygos ascends only as far as the VII. or VIII. dorsal vertebra, and then passes back to the right azygos vein behind the aorta. The upper left inter- costal veins usually unite to form theV. hemiazygos superior, which opens into theF. hemi- azygos, but is also connected with the left innominate vein. The V. azygos and hemiazygos vary a great deal as regards their origin and course.

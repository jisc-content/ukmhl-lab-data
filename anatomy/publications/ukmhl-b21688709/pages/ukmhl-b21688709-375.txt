107 Cerebrum. 448. The Third Ventricle, laid open. View from above, natural size. After removing the Tela ehoroidea superior (s. Velum interpositum), and pushing apart the inner surfaces of both optic thalami, the third ventricle, Ventriculus medius s. tcrtius is laid open to view. It is bounded by six walls: an upper, the Tela ehoroidea superior; two lateral, the inner surfaces of both optic thalami; a lower, corresponding to the middle of the base of the brain; an anterior, formed by the anterior pillars of the fornix, and a posterior, formed by the Corpus quadri- geminum. The lateral walls are connected by three commissures; the anterior commissure, Commissura anterior, in front of the anterior crura of the fornix, the posterior commissure, Commissura poste- rior, in front of the Corpus quadrigeminum, and the middle com- missure, Commissura media s. mollis, which connects the grey portions of the inner surfaces of both optic thalami (sometimes wanting). Beneath the anterior commissure is the Iter s. Aditus ad infundibidum, and beneath the posterior commissure, the Aditus ad aquaeductum Sylvii, which latter, situated below the Corpus quadrigeminum, connects the third and fourth ventricles.

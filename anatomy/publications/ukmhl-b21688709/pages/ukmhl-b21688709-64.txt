36 Temporo - Maxillary Articulation. 45. Left Temporo-Maxillary Articulation, Articulatio temporo-maxillaris, from the outside. The bony parts which constitute the temporo-inaxillary articulation are: the glenoid cavity, the Tuberculum articulare (Emineiitia artlcularis) of the temporal bone above, and the Capitulum (head) of the condyle of the inferior maxilla below. The soft parts of the articulation are: the thin and lax capsular ligament, the external lateral, the internal lateral, the stylo-maxillary ligaments, and the inter articular fibro-cartilage. The Ligamentum laterale externum is a short, broad band, which runs obliquely downward and backward from the zygomatic process of the temporal bone to the Collum (neck) of the condyle of the lower jaw; the inner surface of this ligament is in relation with the interarticular fibro-cartilage and the capsule.

32 Bones of the Face. 39. Inferior Maxillary Bone, Maxilla inferior, from the outside. The inferior maxilla is divided into the b o d y and 2 r a m i. In the middle of the anterior surface of the body is the mental protuberance, Protuberantia mentalis; 1" further externally the mental foramen, Foramen mentale, under which the external oblique line, Liiiea obliqua externa, runs outward to the anterior border of the ramus. The lower border is broad, the upper divided into 16 alveoli, for that number of teeth. The 2 rami ascend from the posterior end of the body; their posterior border forms with the lower border of the body, the angle, Angu&us maxillae. At the upper border there are 2 pro- cesses separated by the sigmoid notch, Tncisura semilunar/*; the anterior is the Processus coronoidevs, the posterior the Processus condyloidem. The latter has a constricted neck, Collwm, and a head, Capitvlum, covered with cartilage, for articulation with the glenoid fossa of the temporal bone.

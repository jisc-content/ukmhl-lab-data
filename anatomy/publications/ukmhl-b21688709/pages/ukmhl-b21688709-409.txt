141 Cranial Nerves. 485. Tlie Superior and Recurrent Laryngeal Nerves. b) Branches of the eleventh and twelfth cranial nerves send motor fibres to the vagus in the Plexus nodosus, which soon after leave as pharyngeal and laryngeal branches, Mami pharyngei and laryngei. c) From the Plexus nodosus branches of communication pass to the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic and to the plexus of the superior cervical nerves; further the d) Superior and inferior pharyngeal nerve, Nervus pharyngeus superior et inferior, whose bi'anches form, in connection with those of the glosso- pharyngeal and sympathetic nerves, the Plexus pliaryngeus. e) Superior laryngeal nerve, N. laryngeus superior, passes along the inner side of the internal carotid artery to the larynx and divides into an external and internal branch, P. externus and internus; the former ends in the inferior constrictor and crico-thyroid muscles; the latter pierces, together with the laryngeal artery, the thyro-hyoid membrane, and supplies the posterior surface of the epiglottis and mucous membrane of the larynx down to the glottis. The internal ramus always inosculates with the recurrent laryngeal nerve of the vagus. f) Filaments of communication to the descending ramus of the hypoglossal and the internal carotid plexus. g) Two to six cardiac branches to the cardiac plexus. 19*

123 Hip-Joint. 170. Tlie Right Hip-Joint, Articulatio coxae, in section. The fibrous capsule, at the anterior surface of the joint very strong, is at its posterior portion much weaker and not attached to the posterior intertrochanteric line, but to the posterior surface of the neck of the femur. The Ligamentum teres ascends vertically from the notch of the acetabulum to the depression on the head of the femur; it is sur- rounded by a sheath of a synovial membrane. The illustration also shows the peculiarly arranged bony structure of the neck and head of the femur. 16*

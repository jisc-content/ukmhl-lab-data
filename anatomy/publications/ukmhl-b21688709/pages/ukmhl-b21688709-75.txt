Bones of the Trunk, 47 58. Outline of a Cervical Vertebra. The transverse process is pierced by a foramen, the Foramen trans- versarivm, which is bound by an anterior and posterior root ; the body low; body and arch form an equilateral triangle; the spinous process is bifid; the perforated transverse process has an anterior and a posterior tubercle, Tuhcrcuhim anterius et postcrius. Rudimentary Rudiment, body 59, The First Cervical Vertebra, Atlas, superior view. The atlas consists of an anterior arch, a posterior arch, and 2 lateral masses, Massae laterales atlantis, formed at the point where the arches unite; it has no articular processes and no spinous process; instead of the articular processes there are superior grooved and inferior flat articular surfaces. In the middle of the posterior surface of the anterior arch lies the articular surface for the odontoid process of the second cervical vertebra.

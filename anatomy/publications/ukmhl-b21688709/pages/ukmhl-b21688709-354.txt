Topography. 86 428. Topography of the Female Perinaeum. In the female the M. ischio-cavernosus s. erector clitoridis lies upon the clitoris, on the back of which the muscles of the two sides unite in a common tendon. The M. bulbo-cavernosus is wanting; it is replaced by the M. constrictor cumii s. sphincter vaginae. This muscle is to be looked at as a continuation of the M. sphincter ani externus, whose right half passes to the left wall of the orifice of the vagina, whose left half to the right wall of the orifice, and it is inserted partly into the back of the clitoris, partly runs to the Fascia superficialis. Sphincter ani externus and Sphincter vaginae therefore form one common muscle, which has the figure of an 8; both are voluntary muscles. The lower bundles of the M. trans- versus perinei run to the median line, the upper bundles to the vagina. If the coccygeal origin of the M. sphincter ani externus is removed, a fibrous layer is reached, which unites the MM. levatores ani; between this layer and the apex of the coccyx the coccygeal gland of L u s c h k a, Glandula coccygea, lies; it is about the size of a hemp seed, sometimes single, sometimes formed of several lobes, and consists in great measure of dilated arterial vessels (see Fig. 426).

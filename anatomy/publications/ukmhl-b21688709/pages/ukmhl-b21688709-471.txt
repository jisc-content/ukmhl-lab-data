203 Arteria subclavia. 547. The Basilary Artery and its Branches at the Base of the Brain. 3. The thyroid axis, Truncus thyreo-cervicalis ; this trunk soon divides into three branches: a) the inferior thyroid, which passes upwards, and after a short course bends inwards and downwards, and is distributed to the under surface of the thyroid gland; its branches are the inferior laryngeal to the larynx, tracheal to the trachea, oesophageal to the oesophagus and ascen- ding cervical; b) the superficial cervical, which, in the supraclavicular fossa passes to the M. trapezius, MM. spleniis and rhomboideis; c) the trans- verse scapular, or suprascapular, which passes behind the clavicle through the scapular notch to the supra- and infraspinous fossae, and supplies the muscles in those regions (see Fig. 550). 4. The superior intercostal, Art. intercostalis supremo, for the first and second intercostal space, which, with the deep cervical for the deep cervical muscles, forms the Truncus costo-cervicalis. 5. The transversalis colli artery, arises between or beyond the scaleni. It pierces the brachial plexus, passes to the upper border of the scapula, where it gives off the Ramus supraspinatus for the MM. trapezius, deltoides, levator scapulae and to the acromion, and then courses along the inner border of the scapula as Art. dorsalis scapulae (see Fig. 550).

The upper extremity of the radius forms the head, Capituhtm radii, which has a somewhat depressed ar- ticular surface; the constricted portion below the head is the neck. Below the latter is the tuberosity, Tuberositas radii (for the insertion of the M. biceps). The three sided shaft turns its most marked bor- der, the Crista radii, toward the same border of the ulna. The broad lower ex- tremity has an articular surface inferiorly, and a second smaller, semilunar ar- ticular surface, the sigmoid cavity of the radius or Inci- sure!, semilunaris radii, at the inner side, where it articulates with the Capitvlum tdnae. From the external surface, the one opposite the sigmoid cavity, the styloid process, Pro- cessus styloideus radii, projects. The radius articulates with four bones: the humerus, the ulna, the scaphoid and semi- lunar bones.

194 Carotis externa. 537. Course and Ramification of the Internal Maxil- lary Artery. View from outside. The branches arising from the first or maxillary portion of the internal maxillary artery are: a) The deep auricular, Art. auricularis profunda, to the external auditory meatus; b) The tympanic, Art. tympanica, through the Glaserian fissure to the tympanum; c) The inferior dental, Art. alveolaris inferior, to the posterior opening of the dental canal. While it runs through this canal it gives off the dental twigs, JRamidi dentales, to the roots of the teeth, escapes by the mental foramen, where it is called mental artery, and anastomoses with the inferior labial, inferior coronary and submental branches. Before it enters the dental canal, it gives off the mylo-hyoid artery, for the mylo-hyoid muscle (see Fig. 538 and 539). d) The middle meningeal, Art. meningea media, which passes directly upwards under cover of the external pterygoid muscle and enters the skull by the Foramen spinosum; within the cranium it divides into an anterior and a posterior branch, which supply the dura mater and diploe of the vault of the cranium (see Fig. 540). It sends the Art. pe.trosa to the tympanic cavity.

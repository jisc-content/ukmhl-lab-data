139 Cranial Nerves. 483. Diagram of the Origin of the Ninth, Tenth, Eleventh and Twelfth Pairs of Cranial Nerves. The tenth pair of cranial nerves are the two pneumo- gastric nerves, Nervi vagi. Arising from the Medulla oblongata, the vagus passes out of the cranium through the jugular foramen, in com- pany with the glosso-pharyngeal and spinal accessory nerves. 1. The cervical portion presents in the jugular foramen the Ganglion jugulare, or ganglion of the root of the pneumogastric, which is connected with the first cervical ganglion, Ganglion cervic. primum (superius) of the sympathetic nerve; below the jugular ganglion the Vagus communicates freely with neighbouring nerves, and thereby the lower ganglion or ga-nglion of the trunk or Plexus nodosus about */2 inch in length, is formed; then the nerve descends between the common carotid artery and internal jugular vein, into and through the thorax. Its branches are: a) Auricular b r a n c h, Ramus auricularis vagi, A r n o 1 d's n e r v e, which arises from the jugular ganglion; it receives a branch from the petrous ganglion of the glosso-pharyngeal nerve, passes outwards behind the jugular vein, reaches the Aquaeductus Fallopii, crosses the facial nerve, with which it is connected by two filaments, and passes through the Canaliculus mastoideus behind the pinna, where it partially communicates with the deep auricular branch of the facial nerve, partly supplies the posterior wall of the external auditory meatus.

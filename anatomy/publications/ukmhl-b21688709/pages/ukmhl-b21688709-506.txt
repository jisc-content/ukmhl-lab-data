Vein; 238 587. The Sinuses of the Dura Mater. Lateral view. The venous blood is returned to the right auricle by two prin- cipal trunks, the superior or descending and the inferior or ascending Venae cavae. The superior Vena cava descends to the right auricle of the heart at the right side of the ascending arch of the aorta and in front of the right pulmonary vessels. It is formed by the union of the right and left innominate veins s. Venae anonymae and receives the V. azygos. Each V. innominata is formed by the union of the subclavian, internal (common) jugular and external jugular veins ; each is joined by the following veins: the vertebral, internal mammary, superior inter- costal, thymic, pericardiac, superior phrenic and anterior mediastinal; the left also by the V. thyreoidca ima. The common jugular, V. jugularis communis, passes up as far as the superior triangle of the neck on the outer side of the common carotid, where it is formed by the union of the internal jugular and common facial veins.

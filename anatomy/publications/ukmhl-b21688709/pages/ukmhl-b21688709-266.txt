Aquaeductus Fallopiae for the facial nerve, commencing at the blind pouch of the internal auditory meatus, runs in the petrous portion first to the outside, then above the Fenestra ovalis posteriorly, and finally to the Foramen stylo-mastoideum downwards; the two angles thus formed are called Genicula. In the first geniculum is the Hiatus s. Apertura spuria Canalis Fallopiae; here the Canaliculus tympanicus opens. Below the second geniculum the Canalis Fallopiae runs behind the Eminentia pyramidalis; it communicates here with its cavity, then with the Canali- culus mastoideus und with the tympanum through the Canaliculus chordae (Fig. 315). Both- Aquaeductus cochleae et vestibuli have veins.

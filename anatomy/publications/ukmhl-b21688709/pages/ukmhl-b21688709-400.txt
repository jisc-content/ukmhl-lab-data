Cranial Nerves. 132 476. The Vidian Nerve after E. Bischoff. b) The Vidian nerve, Nervus Vidianus, consists of two bundles, composed of grey and white nerve fibres; it passes through the Vidian canal from before backwards, and divides at its posterior extremity into two. The grey bundle goes to or rather comes from the Plexus caroticus of the sympathetic, and is called the deep petrosal nerve, N. petrosus profundus; the white bundle forms the great superficial petrosal, N. petrosus superficialis major; this latter passes through the Fibrocartilago basilaris into the cranium, enters the Hiatus canalis Fallopiae and joins the geniculate ganglion of the facial nerve. c) The pharyngeal branches, Rami pharyngei, to the mucous membrane of the upper portion of the pharynx. d) The Ncrvi scptti narium to the upper wall of the posterior nares and Septum narium; the longest of these is called naso-palatine n e r v e, Nervus naso-palatinus Scarpae, and runs along the Septum narium to the Canalis naso-palatinus and through it to the hard palate and gums of the incisor teeth. e) The posterior nasal nerves, Ncrvi nasales posteriores, to the ethmoidal turbinated bones and the posterior parts of the outer wall of the nares. f) The descending palatine nerves, N. ijalatini dcscen- dentes, emerge through the posterior palatine foramina, and supply the hard and soft palate, the uvula, the M. levator palati and M. azygos uvulae. The largest of them, the anterior palatine, Nervus pal at inn* anterior, emerges upon the mucous membrane of the hard palate, and finally communicates with the N. naso-palatinus Scarpae.

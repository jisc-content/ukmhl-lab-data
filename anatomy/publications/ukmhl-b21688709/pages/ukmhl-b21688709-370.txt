The Corpus callosum roofs in the body and anterior cornu of the lateral ventricles, Ventriculi laterales, which are brought into view after removal of their covering. Each lateral ventricle consists of a central cavity or body, Cclla media, and three c o r n u a, an anterior, a posterior and an inferior or descending, which extend from it in different directions. In the anterior cornu of the lateral ventricle are found: a) The Corpus striatum, with a broad extremity directed forwards, and a narrow end directed outwards and backwards. On the outer side of the Corpus striatum is the lenticular or lentiform nucleus, Nucleus lentiformis, a biconvex grey mass, surrounded by white substance. In front and below the lenticular nucleus a rounded mass of yellowish grey matter, the Nucleus amygdalae, is situated, and on the outer side of the lenticular nucleus is a thin lamina of grey matter, the Claustrum. The white substance between the lentiform nucleus and Corpus striatum forms the internal capsule, Capsula interna, that between the lentiform nucleus and claustrum, the external c a p s u 1 e, Capsula externa. b) The Thalamus opticus, situated behind the Corpus striatum, is composed of white substance intermixed with grey matter. Between Corpus striatum and optic thalamus is:

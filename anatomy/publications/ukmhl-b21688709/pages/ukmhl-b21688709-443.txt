The pericardium is covered in front by the pleurae and the mar- gins of the lungs, behind it rests upon the bronchi, oesophagus and descending aorta. After opening of the pericardium a part of the large vessels is found enclosed in its cavity. The aorta, the superior vena cava, the four pulmonary veins and the right and left divisions of the pulmonary artery, receive each an investment from the fibrous layer of the pericardium. The space between heart and pericardium contains a small quantity of Liquor Pericardii.

Elbow-Joint. 97 121. The Articular Surfaces of the Humerus consti- tutiug the Elbow-Joiut, seen from above. The trochlea serves for articulation with the greater sigmoid cavity of the ulna; the radial head, Eminentia capitata, for articulation with the cup-shaped depression on the head of the radius. 122. The Articular Surfaces of the Radius and Ulna constituting the Elbow-Joint, seen from above. The greater sigmoid cavity, Cavitas sigmoidea major ulnae, receives the trochlea of the humerus; the ridge dividing this cavity into two halves corresponds to the furrow on the trochlea. The cup-shaped depression on the head of the radius, Cavitas glenoidalis capituli radii, glides along the Eminentia capitata of the humerus, in flexion and extension, as well as in pronation and supination.

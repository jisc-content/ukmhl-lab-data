Cranial Nerves. 126 470. The Oculomotor, Trochlear and Abducent Ne rves. View from the outside. The sixth nerve, the abducent, Nervusabducens, makes its appearance at the posterior border of the Pons Varolii, passes forwards through the cavernous sinus, in which it lies on the outer side of the internal carotid artery (Carotis cerebralis), and is joined by several filaments from the sympathetic. It then enters the orbit through the sphenoidal fissure and passes between the two heads of the M. rectus externus, to be distri- buted to the muscle, which it pierces on its ocular surface. The fifth, trifacial or trigeminal nerve, Nervus trigeminus, the largest of the cranial nerves, arises by two separate roots. The larger, sensory, posterior root makes its appearance at the anterior surface of the Crus cerebelli ad pontem; the much smaller, motor, anterior root, between the anterior transverse fibres of the Pons Varolii. The two roots of the nerve pass forwards through an oval opening in the dura mater, Cavum Meckeln, at the superior surface of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, where the fibres of the sensory root form a large s e m i- lunar ganglion, the Ganglion Gasseri s. scmilunare. From the convex border of this ganglion the three large branches of the trifacial nerve pro- ceed : the I. ophthalmic branch, Bamus ophthalmicus, the II. s u p e- r i o r maxillary branch, Ramus supramaxillaris, and the III. inferior maxillary, Ramus inframaxillaris.

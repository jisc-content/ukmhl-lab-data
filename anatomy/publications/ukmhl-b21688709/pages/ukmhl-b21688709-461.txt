193 Carotis externa. 536. Diagram of the Ramification of the Internal Maxillary Artery. f) The posterior auricular artery, Art. auricularis posterior, ascends at the anterior border of the mastoid process, and gives off the stylo-mastoid branch, Art. stylo-mastoidea, through the stylo-mastoid foramen to the Canalis Fattopiac. The anterior branch of the posterior auricular artery supplies the auricle, the posterior the soft parts behind the ear. The terminal branches of the external carotid are: 1. The superficial temporal artery, Arteria temporalis super- ficialis, which is divided upon the temporal fascia into an anterior and a posterior branch. The former supplies the integument of the temporal and frontal regions, the latter passes to the vertex. The super- ficial temporal artery gives off the following branches: the trans- verse facial, Art. transversa faciei, which passes transversely up to the region of the infraorbital foramen; the middle temporal, Art. temporalis media, which, perforating the temporal fascia, supplies the tem- poral muscle; the anterior auricular, Art. auriculares antcriores (2â€”3 inferior and 1 superior), to the external auditory meatus and to the anterior surface of the pinna; the orbital, or Art. zygomatico-orhi- talis, which passes obliquely forwards to the margin of the orbit. 2. The internal maxillary artery, Art. maxillaris interna, which supplies all the cavities of the head with branches, can be divided into three portions, in the first part of its course it lies behind the con- dyle of the lower jaw, in the second part it runs obliquely forwards and upwards upon the outer surface of the external pterygoid muscle, in the third part it enters the spheno-maxillary fossa.

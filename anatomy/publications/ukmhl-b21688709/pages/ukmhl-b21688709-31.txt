The upper surface presents a sulcus for the Medulla oblongata. The anterior surface borders on the body of the sphenoid bone; the lateral surfaces articulate with the petrous portions of the temporal bones. 2. Occipital portion. In the middle of the anterior surface is the internal occipital protuberance, Protuherantia occipitalis internet, which is in the center of the Erninentia cruciata interna; the lower half of the perpendicular crus is called the internal occipital crest, Crista occipitalis interna (for the Sinus occipitalis and the Falx cerebeMi); the upper half forms the longitudinal sulcus (for the longitudinal sinus); the two transverse crura contain the transverse sulcus (for the lateral sinus and attachment of the Tentorium cerebelli).

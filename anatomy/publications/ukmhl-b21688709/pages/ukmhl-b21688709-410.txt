142 Cranial Nerves. 486. The Grlosso-Pharyngeal, Pneumogastric and Hypoglossal Nerves. From behind. 2. Tlie thoracic portion of the vagus lies at first to the outer side of the common carotid artery; on the right side it crosses over the right sub- clavian artery, on the left side over the arch of the aorta; each nerve then passes behind the root of each lung, the right vagus passing behind the oeso- phagus, the left in front of it. The branches are: a) Inferior or recurrent laryngeal, Nervas laryngeus recurrens. The right (shorter) winds around the right subclavian artery, the left (longer) around the arch of the aorta; both nerves ascend in the groove between the trachea and oesophagus to the larynx, and supply its muscles. b) Anterior and posterior pulmonary or bronchial, Nervi broncliiales anteriores et posteriore.s. The former form with the cardiac nerves of the sympathetic the anterior pulmonary plexus, Plexus hronchialis anterior, the latter with branches of the thoracic ganglia of the sympathetic the posterior pulmonary plexus, Plexus hronchialis posterior; they are distributed to the anterior and posterior aspects of the root of the lung. c) Oesophageal plexus, Plexus oesophagcus, at the anterior and posterior aspects of the oesophagus. 3. The abdominal portion of the vagus is formed by the twigs leaving the oesophageal plexus, which, by their communication, form the anterior and posterior gastric plexus, Plexus gastricus anterior et posterior, at the anterior and posterior aspects of the stomach; the former communicates with the hepatic plexus, the latter with the coeliac plexus, it sending filaments â€¢to the spleen, pancreas, small intestines and kidney.

183 Heart. 525, The Left Ostium auriculo-ventriculare s. venosum and arteriosus, from above. After a dried specimen, natural size. The wall of the left ventricle, Ventriculus sinister, is, in the adult, considerably thicker than that of the right. Its auriculo-ventricular opening is guarded by the bicuspid or mitral valve, Valvula bicns- pidalis s. mitralis, which consists of an anterior and a posterior segment. Of the semilunar valves surrounding the orifice of the aorta, one is placed to the right, one to the left and one posteriorly; they are stronger and thicker than those of the pulmonary artery, and the Noduli Arantii are larger and more prominent. During the diastole the auricles and ventricles of the heart are filled with blood, which, during the systole is again driven out. The systole of both auricles is, as well as that of the ventricles, synchronous, and the latter follows the former after a very short interval. During the diastole the right heart is filled by the venous blood from the Venae cavae and coronary veins, and during the systole it drives the blood into the pulmonary artery. The left heart is filled during the diastole with the arterial blood from the four pulmonary veins, and during the systole drives the blood into the aorta.

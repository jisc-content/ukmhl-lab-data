Cavity and Ossicula auditus, from above. b) The Incus or anvil has a body, a short and a long pro- cess. The short process is articulated with the posterior wall of the tympanum by means of ligamentous fibres; the long process is bent inwards at its extremity and terminates in a rounded projection, the lenti- cular process or Ossiculum lent/'cularc Sylvzi. With the latter the head of the stapes articulates. c) The stapes or stirrup consists of a head, from which diverge the two curved crura; these are connected at their extremities by the base, which fits into the Fenestra ovalis, and the space between them is filled out by a membrane, the Membrana propria stapedis. The muscles w h i c h move the Ossicula auditus are: the M. ten- sor tympani, which heightens the tension of the Membrana tympani, and arises from the Eustachian tube and under surface of the petrous bone; it lies in the Semicanalis, its tendon bends around the Rostrum coch- leare, and is inserted into the neck of the malleus. — M. laxator tympani, which relaxes the Membrana tympani, arises from the spinous process of the sphenoid bone, and, passing through the Glaserian fissure is inserted into the long process of the malleus. — M. stapedius, the muscle of the stirrup (Fig. 314) lies in the hollow of the Eminentia pyramidalis: its tendon emerges from the orifice at the apex of the pyramid, and is inserted into the head of the stapes.

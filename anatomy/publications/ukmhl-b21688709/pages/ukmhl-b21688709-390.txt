122 Fibres of the Brain. 400. The Fibres of the Pallium Cerebri* 2/3 natural size. From the Corpus ccdlosum the fibres pass outwards on both sides into the cerebral hemispheres; the fibres which curve backwards into the posterior lobes are called the Forceps posterior, those which curve forwards and inwards to the anterior lobe, Forceps anterior, finally those which help to form the covering of the posterior and inferior horn of the lateral ventricles, the Tapetum. The upper surface of the pallium contains the convolutions enume- rated above, and is covered by a layer of grey matter up to 2 lines in thickness. On the anterior and median portions of the hemispheres is a deep note h, the Incisura pallii, whose floor is formed by the Corpus ccdlosum, and its lateral walls by the inner surfaces of the anterior and upper lobes. Another deep notch is the Sylvian fissure, which divides the inferior lobe from the anterior and upper lobes; in it most of the arterial branches are found. Fig. 464, 465 and 466 are drawn from alcohol specimens and with the aid of Fr. A niol d's figures. * By some German anatomists, the brain is divided into two parts: â€žHirnstamm", Truncus cerebri, and ,,Hi rnmantel", Pallium cerebri, i. e. the cerebral hemispheres. The former comprises the peduncles of the cerebrum and cerebellum and the tegmentum, the latter, the Corona radiata, commissures and convolutions.

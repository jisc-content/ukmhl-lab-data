178 Heart. Vcoronaria 520, Horizontal Section through the Heart (Vertically to the long axis of the body.) The heart is divided by a muscular septum into two halves, each of which is again subdivided into an upper cavity, the auricle*, Auri- cula, and a lower cavity, the ventricle, Ventriculus. The partition between the ventricles is called Septum ventriculorum, that between the auricles, Septum auriculorum. Each ventricle is triangular in form, the walls of the left considerably thicker than those of the right. The mus- cular columns which project from nearly the whole of the inner surfaces of the ventricles, are called Columnae cameae; those which run across the inner surface of the Appendix auriculae, and adjoining portion of the wall of the sinus, Musculi pectinati. Into the right auricle the Venae cavae and coronary sinus open, into the left the four pulmonary veins. Each auricle communicates with the corresponding ventricle by means of the auriculo-ventricular orifice, Ostium auriculo-ventriculare s. venosum; the ventricles open into the arteries which arise from them, each by means of an Ostium arteriosum, the right into the pulmonary artery by means of the opening for the pul- monary artery, the left into the aorta, by means of the aortic opening. All openings have valves; between auricles and ventricles are the Valvulae auri- culo-ventricular es, between ventricles and arteries the Valvulae semicircular es. * The principal cavity or sinus of the auricle is often known as the atrium, to dis- tinguish it from the auricular appendix, which is called auricle proper, Auricula.

Bones of the Face. 26 Art rv.t. yrontal b. 28. Right Malar Bone, 29. Right Malar Bone, Os zygomaticum, Os zygomaticum, from the outside. from the inner side. The malar bone has 3 processes: the strongest frontal p r o- cess, Processus frontalis, articulating with the frontal bone; the zygo- matic process, Processus zygomaticus, which forms with the zygomatic process of the temporal bone the Arcus zygomaticus, and the smallest sphenoidal process, Processus splienoidalis, which, looking backward, articulates with the anterior border of the orbital surface of the great wing of the sphenoid bone. Body is that portion which articulates with the zygomatic process of the superior maxilla. (This part is also called maxillary process.) The surfaces are the facial (external), temporal (internal), and orbital. From the' orbital surface to the facial surface runs the Canalis zygomaticus facialis, with an accessory canal to the temporal surface. Behind this canal there is a second, leading from the orbital cavity into the tem- poral fossa, the Canalis zygomaticus temporalis, (These canals are also called temporo-malar canals.) The malar bone articulates with 4 bones: with 3 cranial bones, the frontal, sphenoid and temporal, and 1 bone of the face, the superior maxilla.

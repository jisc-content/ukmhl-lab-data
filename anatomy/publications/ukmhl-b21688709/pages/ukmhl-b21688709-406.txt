138 Cranial Nerves. 482. The Nerve of Jacobson in the Tympanic Cavity. (Enlarged.) JRnmi ad Tub. Eustachii 482a. The Tympanic Plexus. After E. Bischoff. The ninth cranial nerve is the glosso - pharyngeal nerve, Nervtis glosso-pharyngeus. It passes through the jugular foramen in a separate sheath of the dura mater and forms here the jugular ganglion, Ganglion jugulare,' which is not constant; in the Fossii/a petvosa of the petrous bone is the petrous ganglion, Ganglion petroswn, always present, which communicates with the sympathetic nerve and the auricular branch of the pneumogastric. From this petrous ganglion, Jacobson's nerve, the tympanic branch of the ninth nerve, arises; this nerve runs forwards in the tympanic cavity, in a groove of the promontory, sends twigs to the mucous membrane of the tympanic cavity and to the Eustachian tube, is united by means of the Nervi carotico-tympanid with the carotid plexus, and finally passes into the small superficial petrosal nerve. In the neck the glosso-pharyngeal nerve sends branches of communi- cation to the pneumogastric nerve, to the carotid plexus, and the digastric and stylo- hyoid branches of the facial nerve; also pharyn- geal branches to the muscles of the pharynx (see Fig. 486). Finally the nerve gives off lingual branches, which pass to the tongue and supply tbc Arcus glosso-palatinus, the tonsils, the anterior surface of the epiglottis and the root of the tongue, and finally end in the Papillae vallatae.

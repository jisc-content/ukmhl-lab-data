239 Veins. 588. The Sinuses of the Dura Mater. Seen from above. The internal jugular vein passes out by the jugular foramen, where it forms a dilatation, the sinus or Bulbus superior; it receives the pharyngeal veins, often a lingual vein. In the jugular foramen it is connected with the transverse sinus. Of the sinuses of the dura mate r some are double, one on each side, some single. 1. The largest single sinus is called the Confluens sinuum s. Torcular HeropMli; it lies in front of the internal occipital protuberance and is the point of meeting of all the sinuses. 2. The transverse sinus is double. 3. The superior longitudinal sinus, Sinus falciformismajor, occupies the attached margin of the Falx cerebri. 4. The inferior longitudinal sinus, Sinus falci- formis minor, is contained in the posterior part of the free margin of the Falx cerebri. 5. The straight sinus (rectus) passes obliquely backwards. 6. The two cavernous sinuses at the sides of the Sella turcica,- their continuations are the Sinus alae parvae, both of which are connected by means of the circular sinus, Sinus circularis Bidlei. 7. The superior petrosal sinuses are situated along the upper border of the petrous portions of the temporal bones. 8. The inferior petrosal sinuses situated in the groove formed by the junction of the inferior border of the petrous bone with the basilar process of the occipital. 9. The occipital sinus surrounds the Foramen magnum.

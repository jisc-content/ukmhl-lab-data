Hip-Joint. 121 108. The Right Hip-Joint, Articulatio coxae, from before. The fibrous capsule of the hip-joint is attached above to the bony margin of the acetabulum and below at the anterior surface of the femur, to the Lima intertrockantcrica anterior. The strong Ligamentum Bertini (ileo-femoral ligament) serves to strengthen the anterior capsular wall; it is attached above to the anterior inferior spine of the ilium, below partly to the anterior intertrochanteric line (Fig. 154), and partly sur- rounds the neck of the femur by two bands as Zona orbicularis Webcri (Fig. 156).* * This is frequently designated the Y-ligament of Bigelow.

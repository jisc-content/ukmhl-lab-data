230 Arteria cruralis. ilei A. circumfl. A. ejpigastr. '"J- A.A ext. 577. C ourse and Ramification of the Crural Artery. The crural artery, Art. cruralis, has received the names of external iliac, femoral and popliteal in different parts of its course. The external iliac ar- tery passes obliquely down- wards and outwards along the inner border of the M. j)soas, from the bifurcation of the common iliac artery to Poupart's ligament, where it enters the thigh, and be- comes the femoral artery. The femoral artery com- mences immediately behind Poupart's ligament, and pas- sing down the fore part and inner side of the thigh, ter- minates at the opening in the M. adductor magnus at the junction of the middle with the lower third of the thigh, where it becomes the p o p- 1 i t e a 1. The popliteal a r t e r y, commencing at the opening in the M. adduc- tor- magnus, passes obliquely downwards and outwards behind the knee-joint to the lower border of the M. pop- Kteus, and there divides into the anterior and poste- rior tibial arteries. The branches of the external iliac are: a) The inferior epi- gastric, Art. epigastriea inferior. It at first descends to reach Poupart's ligament, and then ascends obliquely inwards to the outer mar- gin of the M. rectus abdo- minis, and anastomoses above the umbilicus with the supe- rior epigastric artery from the internal mammary (see Fig. 548 and 570). From it arise the p u b i c, Bamus ana- stomoticus pubicus; the ex- ternal spermatic to the spermatic cord and sheaths of the scrotum; and numerous m u s c u 1 a r b ranches.

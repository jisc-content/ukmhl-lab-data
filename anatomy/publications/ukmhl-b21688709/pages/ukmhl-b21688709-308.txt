40 Topography. 370. Horizontal Section through the Abdomen below the xiphoid appendix iu the pit of the stomach. From a one year old child in natural size. The peritoneum or serous membrane of the abdominal cavity, may be considered to form a shut sac, but in the female the two Fallopian tubes open at their free extremities into its cavity; it invests all the abdominal and pelvic viscera completely or partially, forming the visceral layer of the membrane, Peritoneum viscerale; then it is reflected upon the internal surface of the parietes of these cavities, forming the parietal layer, Peritoneum parietale. The reflections of the peritoneum are different in the pelvic organs of the male and female, but identical as regards the other organs. In the male the vesico-rectal fold or Excavatio vesico-rectalis is formed between the bladder and rectum; in the female between the bladder and uterus (with its appendages) the anterior Excavatio vesico-uterina and the posterior, deep Excavatio utero-rectalis. At the anterior abdominal wall the peritoneum forms the suspensory ligament of the liver, in the lower margin of which is the round ligament, the obliterated remains of the umbilical vein. Between liver and stomach the lesser omentum, Omentum minus, is attached; its right border contains the portal vein and is called Lig. liepato-duodenale. The great omentum, Omentum majus, descends from the stomach and in front of the small intestines as low down as the pelvis ; it then ascends again as far as the transverse colon, and aids in the formation of the transverse meso-colon; further back it covers the pancreas and forms the posterior wall of the Bursa omen- talis. The mesentery, Mesenterium, is the broad fold of peritoneum which connects the small intestines with the posterior wall of the abdomen.

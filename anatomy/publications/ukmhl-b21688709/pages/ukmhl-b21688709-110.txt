Bones of the Upper Extremity. 82 103. The Left Shoulder-Blade, Scapula, from before. The scapula has: an anterior, a posterior surface, an internal, external and superior border, an inferior, superior external and superior internal angle, finally two processes. The bone covers the posterior surface of the 2. to the 7.-8. ribs. The anterior surface is somewhat concave, and is marked by 8 â€” 5 ridges, Costae scapulares (for insertions of muscles). The shortest superior border has at its outer end the deep supra-scapular notch, Incisvra scapulae. At the superior external, thickened angle is the glenoid cavity, Cavi- tas glenoidalis, for the head of the humerus; the slightly depressed surface which surrounds the head, is called the neck, Collum.

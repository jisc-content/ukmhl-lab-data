Bones of the Cranium. 16 10. Left Temporal Bone, Os temporum, from below. The inferior surface of the p etrous p o r t i o n forms at its external part a small plate of bone, Os tyinpanicum, which surrounds the Meatus auditorius extemus interiorly and anteriorly, and is separated from the glenoid fossa of the squamous portion by the Glaserian fissure, Fissura Glaseri (Fig. 14). Passing from within outward we have: the Foramen stylo-mastoidcum, below the external auditory meatus (termination of the Aquacductus Fallopii); the Processus Styloideus ; the Fossa jugular is with the small orifice of the Canali- culus mastoideus. â€” Near the jugular fossa the lower opening of the Canalis caroticus, and above this two small canals, CanaUeuli carotico-tympanici [to the tympanic carity); toward the posterior border the triangular orifice of the Aquacductus cochleae, Between the Incisura jugularis and the lower opening of the carotid canal lies the Fossula petrosa, with the origin of the Canaliculus tympanicus. At the shortest anterior border of the petrous portion (at its outer end), lies an opening divided into 2 halves by a thin plate of bone; the upper smaller one is the commencement of the Semi- canalis tmsoris tympani, the lower one the opening of the Tid>a Eustachu.

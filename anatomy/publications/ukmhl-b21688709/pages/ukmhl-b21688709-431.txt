Spinal Nerves. 163 507. The Nerves at the Dorsum of the Foot, extensor proprius polltcis; it at first accompanies the anterior tibial artery, lying to its outer side, then lies in front of it and again at its outer side at the ankle-joint, from where it passes to the dorsum of the foot. It divides into an external branch for the M. extensor digitorum hrevis and an internal branch, which, communicating with the internal division of the musculo-cutaneous nerve, supplies the adjacent sides of the large and second toe. 2. The internal popliteal, N. poplitem internus, descends along the back of the thigh through the middle of the popliteal space, to the lower part of the M. popliteus, where it passes with the artery beneath the arch of the soleus, and becomes the posterior tibial. Its branches are the external or short saphenous nerve, N. suralis or N. com- municans poplitei which receives a communicating branch from the exter- nal popliteal nerve and is distributed to the integument along the outer Heitzmann, Atlas.

Veins. 243 592. The Veins of the Face and Neck. The deep veins of the neck besides the pharyngeal, lin- gual and superior thyroid are the following: a) The vertebral runs in the canal of the transverse processes of the cervical vertebrae and receives the veins from the spinal canal and the cer- vical veins; finally it terminates in the innominate or subclavian veins. b) The inferior thyroid receives veins from the pharynx and larynx and unites with the corresponding vein of the opposite side, thereby forming the Plexus thyreoideus imus, and then the V. thyrcoidea impar, which opens into the left innominate vein.

Muscles of the Back 225. The Long Muscles of the Back. M. complexus major (Fig. 224) arises by seven tendinous slips from the transverse processes of the four lower cervical and three upper dorsal vertebrae and the articular processes of the 3.—6. cervical vertebrae; Inscriptiones tendineae. It is inserted bet- ween the superior and inferior curved lines of the occipital bone. (Draws the head backwards.) M. trachelo-mastoideus s. complexus minor (Fig. 224) arises from the trans- verse and articular processes of the four lower cervical and three upper dorsal vertebrae, and is inserted into the posterior margin of the mastoid process. (Draws the head backwards and rotates it.) 31. spinalis dor si (Fig. 224) arises from the spinous processes of the two upper lumbar and three lower dorsal vertebrae, and is inserted into the spinous processes of the VIII.—II. dor- sal vertebrae. (Extends the spinal column and head.) M. semispinalis dorsi arises from the transverse processes of the VI.—XI. dorsal vertebrae. It is inserted by six tendons into the spinous processes of the 7- cervical and five upper dorsal vertebrae. (Produces lateral flexion of the spinal column and rotates it.) M. spinalis cervicis s. colli (not illustra- ted) arises from the spinous processes of the lower cervical and upper dorsal ver- tebrae, and is inserted into the spinous processes of the upper cervical verte- brae, excepting the atlas. (Extends.) M. semispinalis cervicis s. colli arises from the transverse processes of the upper dorsal vertebrae, being inserted by four tendinous slips into the spinous processes of the 2-—5. cervical ver- tebrae. nr. vr vn.

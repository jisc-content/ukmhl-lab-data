Spinal Nerves. 154 498. The Nerves at the Dorsal Side of the Hand. 7. Musculo-spiral nerve*, the largest branch of the brachial plexus, has its origin from the posterior cord of the plexus. At first it lies behind the axillary artery, winds round the back of the humerus, passing from the inner to the outer side of the bone, between the external and internal heads of the M. triceps; it pierces the external intermuscular septum and descends between the M. brachialis anticus and M. supinator longus to the front of the external condyle; its muscular branches supply the MM. triceps, anconaeus, supinator longus, extensor carpi radialis longior and brachialis anticus. It sends cutaneous branches to the inner and extensor surfaces of the upper- and forearm. It ends by dividing into two branches: a) The radial nerve lies a little to the outer side of the radial artery, concealed beneath the M. supinator longus; a few inches above the wrist it pierces the deep fascia and divides into two branches, an external, smaller, sup- plying the integument of the radial side and ball of the thumb, and an inter- nal, larger, whose branches supply the adjoining sides of the thumb, index and middle fingers, and, with the dorsal branch of the ulnar nerve, the contiguous sides of the middle and ring fingers. b) The posterior interosseous nerve, passes through the fibres of the M. supinator brews to the outer side of the forearm; its muscular branches supply the MM. extensor carpi radialis brevior, supinator brevis, extensor communis digitorum, extensor minimi digiti, extensor carpi ulnaris, the 3 extensors of the thumb and the extensor indicis. It also sends the R. interosseous externus down to the capsule of the wrist-joint. * This nerve is sometimes known as the radial nerve; its terminal branches are then called the superficial (radial) and the deep (posterior interosseous).

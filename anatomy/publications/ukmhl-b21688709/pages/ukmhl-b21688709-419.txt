Spinal Nerves. 151 3. External or musculo- cutaneous, N. cutaneus bracliii cxternus s. musculo-cutaneus arises from the outer cord of the bra- chial plexus. It perforates the M. coraco-braclrialis, passes ob- liquely between M. biceps and M. brachialis anticus to the elbow, where it pierces the fascia of the upper arm, accompanies the cephalic vein to the back of the hand and communicates with the dorsal branch of the radial nerve. It supplies the MM. coraco-bra- chialis, biceps and brachialis anticus, and the integument on the radial side of the forearm. 4. Circumflex, N. circum- flexus s. axillaris, arises from the posterior cord of the plexus, and winds around the neck of the humerus in company with the posterior circumflex artery; it supplies the capsule of the shoul- der-joint; with a cutaneous branch the posterior region of the shoul- der and upper arm; with muscu- lar branches the M. teres minor and M. dcltoides (see Fig. 499). 5. Median nerve, N. me- dianus, arises by two roots, one from the outer and one from the inner cord of the brachial ple- xus ; these embrace the lower part of the axillary artery (see Fig- 493). It descends in the Sulcus bicipitalis interims, lying at first to the outer side of the brachial artery, then crosses the vessel above the elbow and lies to its inner side, and beneath the M. pronator radii teres and M. flexor carpi radialis, to within two inches above the annular liga- ment, where it becomes more super - 495.

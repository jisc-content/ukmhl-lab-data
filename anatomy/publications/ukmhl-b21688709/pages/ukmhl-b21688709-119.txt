Bones of the Upper Extremity 91 The s up er i o r e x- tremity of the ulna shows a deep excavation, the grea- ter sigmoid cavity, Cavitas sigmoiclea major, which is bounded above by the ole- cranon process (also called Processus anconacus), and below by the coronoid process. On the outer side of the latter is the lesser sigmoid cavity, Cavitas sig- moiclea minor, for articulation with the head of the radius ; below this is the tuberosity, Tuberositas ulnae (for the in- sertion of the M. brachialis anticus). The shaft lias three surfaces and three bor- ders, of which latter the one turned toward the radius is called the Crista ulnae. The inferior ex- tremity is called head, Capitulum: this has an ar- ticular facet, part of which is turned downwards, and part outwards to be received into the sigmoid cavity of the radius. From the back part of the bead the sty- loid process, Processus styloidtus ulnae projects. The ulna articulates with the humerus and the radius. 112. The Right Ulna, Ulna, from before. 113.

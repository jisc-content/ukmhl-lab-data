236 Arteria tibialis postica. 5S4. The Plantar 585. The Plantar Ar- Arteries. Superficial view. teries. Deep view. The terminal branches of the posterial tibial artery are the inter- nal and external plantar, Art. plantar is interna and Art. plantaris externa. The internal, smaller, lies between the M. abductor pollic is and M. flexor brevis digitorum, and sends off superficial and deep branches for the skin and muscles at the inner border of the sole of the foot. The external plantar artery passes outwards above the M. flexor brevis digitorum, and gives off branches for the integument and muscles, and the external digital, Art. digitalis plantaris externa, for the outer side of the little toe. Running inwards from the base of the fifth metatarsal bone to the interval between the first and second metatarsal bones, it joins the dorsal artery of the foot, thereby forming the plantar arch, Arcus plantaris. From the arch arise four interosseous arteries, Arteriae interosseae plantares, which send perforating branches to the dorsum of the foot, and then divide each into two plantar digital branches, for the contiguous borders of the toes. The first plantar interosseous artery however, gives off three branches, supplying also the inner side of the great toe with an internal plantar artery.

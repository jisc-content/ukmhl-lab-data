74 Articulations of the Eibs. 94. Articulations between the Posterior Ends of the Ribs and the Vertebrae, Articulationes cosfo-spinales, inferior view. Between the tubercles of the ribs and the transverse processes of the vertebrae are the costo-transverse articulations, Articulationes costo- transverscdes; they are not present on the eleventh and twelfth ribs. These articulations are surrounded by thin capsules and strengthened by the following ligaments: by the Ltgamentum costo-transversale posterius (posterior costo-transverse), passing from the rough portion of the Tuberculum costae to the summit of the transverse process of the vertebra; by the Ligamenhim colli costae anterius (anterior costo-transverse, Fig. 93) passing between the transverse process and upper border of the neck of the rib; and the Ligamentum colli costae posterius (middle costo-transverse), placed between the transverse process and the posterior surface of the neck of the rib.

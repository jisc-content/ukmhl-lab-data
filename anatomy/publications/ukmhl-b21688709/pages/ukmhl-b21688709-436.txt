168 Sympathetic Nerves. V N. TR1GEM1M. 512. The Communication of the Carotid Plexus with some of the Cranial Nerves. After Eiidinger. The sympathetic nerve, N. sympatheticus, consists of a series of ganglia, connected together by intervening cords, and of a number of plexuses. The cervical portion of the sympathetic, Pars cermcalis N. sympathici, consists of three ganglia on each side. The superior is the largest, the middle is sometimes absent, the inferior is fre- quently joined with the first thoracic ganglion. The latter gives off the inferior cardiac nerve, N. cardiacus inferior, to the deep cardiac plexus, the middle gives off the middle cardiac, N. cardiacus medius. The thoracic portion of the sympathetic, Pars thoracica N. sympathici, consists of eleven thoracic ganglia, which communicate with each other and with the intercostal nerves; they strengthen the thoracic plexuses. The first thoracic ganglion gives off the N. cardiacus imus to the cardiac plexus. The two splanchnic nerves, Nervi splanchnici, pass to the plexuses of the abdomen. The lumbo-sacral portion of the sympathetic, Pars lumbo-sacralis N. sympathici has four or five lumbar ganglia, Ganglia lumbalia, and the same number of sacral ganglia, Ganglia sacralia, which are connected with the lumbar nerves. They supply the plexuses of the abdomen, the Ganglia sacrcdia also the Plexus hypogastrics inferior. At the coccyx, the two gangliated cords converge, and are connected by means of a loop, in which a single ganglion, Ganglion coccygeum impar, is found. The plexuses of the sympathetic nerve are formed not only by the sympathetic, but also by the cranial and spinal nerves. The cranial plexuses are: the Plexus caroticus interims (called in the cavernous sinus: Plexus cavernosus) and the Plexus caroticus externus.

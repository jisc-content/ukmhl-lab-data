221 Aorta abdominalis. 567. The Ramification of the Inferior Mesenteric Artery. The other branches of the abdominal aorta, one on each side, are: 1. The suprarenal arteries, Arteriae suprarenales, 2. The renal arteries, Arteriae renales, which arise below the superior mesenteric artery, give oft' capsular branches to the connective tissue and fat around the kidney, also -smaller branches to the pelvis of the kidney and the ureter, and then enter the substance of the kidney. 3. The internal spermatic arteries, Arteriae spermaticae internae; the one on the left side arises from the aorta below the renal artery, while the right usually arises from the right reual artery. In the male they are directed outwards, to the internal abdominal ring, and accompany the other consti- tuents of the spermatic cord along the spermatic canal to the testis; in the female they pass to the ovaries and along the Fallopian tubes to the uterus, and anastomose with a branch of the uterine arteries (see Fig. 575). 29*

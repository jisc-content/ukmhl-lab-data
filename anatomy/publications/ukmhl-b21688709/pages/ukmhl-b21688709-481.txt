213 Arteria radialis et ulnaris. 559. The Arteries at the Back of the Hand. The superficial palmar arch, Arcus volaris sublimis (see Fig. 557) has its convexity directed towards the fingers ; it is the continuation of the ulnar artery, and is sometimes completed by inosculating with the superficialis volae branch of the radial. From its convexity three digi- tal branches, Arteriae digitales volares communes, are given off, each of which divides into two, the Arteriae digitales volares propriae, to supply the contiguous surfaces of the second, third, fourth and fifth fingers, down to the tip; a fourth branch supplies the ulnar side of the little finger. The deep palmar arch, Arcus volaris profundus (see Fig. 558), the smaller and less convex, is formed principally by the radial artery. It gives off three palmar interosseous branches, Arteriae inter- osseac volares, which lie in front of the interosseous spaces of the four fingers, send off perforating branches, Rami interossei perforantes, to the dorsum of the hand and inosculate with the digital branches from the superficial arch. From the posterior carpal arch, Bete carpi dorsah, only three interosseous arteries, Arteriae interosseae dorsales, are given off, the first arising directly from the radial artery; this latter divides into three branches, the others only into two; these are called d 0 r- sal digital arteries, Arteriae digitales dorsales, and pass down as far as the second phalanges. 28*

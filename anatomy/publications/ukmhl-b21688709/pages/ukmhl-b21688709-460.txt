192 Carotis externa. 535. The Arteries of the Face and Pericranium. From the inner side of the external carotid arises: d) The ascending pharyngeal artery, Art. pharyngea ascendens, which ascends at the side of the pharynx, and, dividing into two branches, supplies the posterior wall of the pharynx (see Fig. 542). From the posterior portion of the external carotid arise: e) The occipital artery, Art. occipitalis. At its origin it is covered by the posterior belly of the digastric muscle, then passes beneath the M. sterno- deido-mastoideus to the occiput, where it divides into two terminal branches and supplies the soft parts up'to the vertex. It gives off the mastoid artery, Art. mastoidea, which passes through the mastoid foramen to the dura mater, and the Art. cervicalis descendens to the muscles at the back of the neck.

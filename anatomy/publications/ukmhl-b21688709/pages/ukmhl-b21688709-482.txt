214 Aorta thoracica. 560. Segment of the Thoracic Aorta with Injected Vasavasorum. View from behind. Natural size. The descending thoracic aorta, Aorta thoracica descendens, gives off numerous, but mostly small branches. These are: a) The posterior bronchial, Arteriae bronchioles posteriores, to the posterior wall of the bronchial tubes, the right frequently arises from the third or fourth right intercostal artery. The anterior bronchial, Arteriae bron- chioles anteriores, arise from the internal mam- mary artery. b) The oesophageal, Arteriae oeso- phageae, 2 â€” 4 in number. c) The mediastinal, Arteriae media- stinicae, to the structures in the posterior media- stinum. These, as well as the previous, supply also the posterior wall of the pericardium by means of the posterior pericardiac arteries. d) The intercostal, Arteriae intercostales, for the nine inferior intercostal spaces and for the lower border of the twelfth rib, the two upper intercostal spaces being supplied by the superior intercostal branch of the subclavian artery. The left are shorter than the right. Each of these arteries divides into a posterior or dorsal and an anterior or intercostal branch. The dorsal branches pass each between the transverse processes of two vertebrae to the muscles of the back, and also supply the spinal cord and its membranes with branches, which enter through the intervertebral foramina. Each intercostal branch passes forwards to the sternum in the Sulcus costae of the rib above it, sends the supracostal branch to the upper border of the rib below and finally unites with the anterior intercostal branch of the internal mammary artery. The intercostal branches supply the intercostal muscles, the M. pectoralis major, M. ser- ratus macjnus and the costal origins of the abdominal muscles, in the female also the mammary gland.

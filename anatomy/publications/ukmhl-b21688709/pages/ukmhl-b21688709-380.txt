Cerebellum. 112 453. The Cerebellum, view from before. The Tonsils completely, the Cuneiform Lobes partially removed. Natural size. Upon the under surface of each hemisphere of the cerebellum are four lobes (see Fig. 451): a) The inferior posterior lobe, Lobus inferior posterior s. semilunaris; b) The cuneiform lobe, Lobus cuneiformis (this comprises the two lobes usually called digastric and slender lobes); c) The amygdala or tonsil, Tonsilla, projecting into the fourth ventricle; finally d) The Flocculus s. Lobulus, with the Pedunculus flocculi, which latter reaches down to the inferior vermiform process as posterior medul- lary v e 1 u m, Velum cerebelli posterius. The middle portion of the cerebellum lying in the valley, is called inferior vermiform process, Vermis inferior: the parts entering into the composition of this body are: a) The Tuber valvulae or Commisswa brevis, uniting the inferior posterior lobes of the two sides; b) The pyramid, connecting the digastric lobes; c) The uvula, placed between both tonsils, and d) The nodule, Modulus Malacami, the anterior pointed termination of the inferior vermiform process, which is connected to the peduncles of the flocculus by means of the posterior medullary velum. This velum is of a semilunar form on each side, its anterior margin being free and concave, its posterior convex margin continuous with the central white substance of the inferior vermiform process; between it and the nodule and uvula behind, is a deep fossa, called the swallow's nest.

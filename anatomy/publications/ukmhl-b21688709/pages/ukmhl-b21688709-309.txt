The larynx is composed of the following cartilages: a) The thyroid cartilage, C'artilago thyreoidea, consists of two muactLl- lateral lamellae, quadrilateral in form, united at an acute angle; the upper border is deeply notched in the middle line, imme- diately above the Pomum Adami (Prominentia laryngis), while on either side it is somewhat concave. The posterior border of each lamella terminates in the superior and inferior cornua, Comu super ius (longum) and Comu infer ius (breve). b) The cricoid cartilage, C'artilago cricoidea, lies below the thyroid cartilage, between its inferior cornua, with which it articulates; it is shaped like a signet ring and has a narrow anterior and a broad posterior portion. The upper border of the posterior portion has two oval facets for articulation with the bases of the arytenoid cartilages. c) The arytenoid cartilages, Cartilagines arytaenoideae (a right and a left), are pyramidal in form, and rest by their bases on the posterior and highest part of the cricoid cartilage; the apex of each cartilage is pointed and curved backwards and each has three surfaces, an inter- nal, external or anterior and a posterior, all covered by the laryngeal mucous membrane. The anterior angle of the base forms a horizontal projection, the vocal process, Processus vocalis, for the true vocal cord; the external, the muscular process, Processus muscularis, for the insertion of the posterior and lateral crico-arytenoid muscles.

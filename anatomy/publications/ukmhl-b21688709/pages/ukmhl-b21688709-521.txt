Portal Vein. 253 605. The Brandies of Origin of the Vena portae. The portal vein, Vena portae, receives its branches or roots of origin from the digestive organs and carries their blood to the liver. These roots unite to form the Truncus venae portae, which ramifies in the liver. The branches of origin of the V. portae are: a) The superior gastric vein, which runs along the upper curvature of the stomach from left to right, and receives the blood from the upper portion of the stomach and superior transverse portion of the duodenum. b) The s u p e r i o r or g r e a t mesenteric vein, which receives the blood from those portions of the intestine, which are supplied by the superior mesenteric artery and the pancreatico-duodenal branch of the hepatic artery. 33*

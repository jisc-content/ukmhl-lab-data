Nasal Fossa. 42 52. The Nasal Fossa, Cavum narium. The nasal fossa is divided into the nasal fossa proper, and the sinuses (Sinus frontalis, sphenoidalis, maxillaris). Superiorly the nasal fossa proper is bounded by the nasal bones and the Lamina cribrosa of the ethmoid bone; inferiorly by the palate process of the superior maxilla and the Partes horizontals of the palate bones. The lateral walls are formed above by the nasal process of the superior maxilla, the lachrymal bone, the Lamina papyracea of the ethmoid bone; further down by the internal or nasal surface of the superior maxilla (Superfic. nasal, max. svp.) the Pars perpendicular is of the palate bone, and the pterygoid process of the sphenoid (Proc. pterygoid, oss. sphenoid.). The anterior wall is formed by the nasal bones; a large part of it is lacking; in its place is the Aper- tura pyriformis. The posterior wall is formed partly by the anterior sur- face of the body of the sphenoid (Corpus oss. sphenoid.), below this are two openings, the Ghoanae (posterior nai-es). Each choana is limited above by the body of the sphenoid bone, externally by its pterygoid process (Proc. pteryg. oss. spjhenoid.), internally by the vomer and inferiorly by the Pars liorkontalis of the palate bone.

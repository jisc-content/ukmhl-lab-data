Topography. 174 516. Topography of the Thoracic Viscera. The heart is contained in a conical, membranous sac, the Peri- cardium, the apex of which is directed upwards and surrounds the great ves- sels, the base of which is attached to the central tendon of the diaphragm. The pericardium consists of an external and an internal layer; the former has the structure of fibrous, the latter of serous membranes. The serous layer invests the heart, and is then reflected on the inner surface of the pericardium â€¢ it consists, therefore, of a visceral and a parietal portion. The fibrous layer is continued above for some distance along the large blood-vessels in the form of tubular prolongations, which become gradually lost upon their external coats.

129 Knee-joint. 179. The External Lateral Ligament, Ligamentum laterale externum, of the Right Knee-Joint The rounded external lateral ligament passes from the tuberosity on the external condyle of the femur to the head of the fibula. It lies out- side of the thin fibrous capsule, which is strengthened by fibrous expansions on the posterior and external surface of the joint. The stronger band of fibres lying in the popliteal space is described as popliteal liga- ment, Ligamentum popliteum, those fibres lying externally as short external lateral ligament, IAgamentwm laterale externum breve. The relation of these fibres with the muscle insertions is seen in the drawing. Heitzmann, Atlas. I. 1Â«

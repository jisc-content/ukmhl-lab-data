The superior surface of the body is covered with cartilage and serves for articulation with the tibia; the internal surface is also covered with cartilage for articulation with the inner malleolus of the tibia, while the larger external surface articulates with the external malleolus of the fibula. The inferior concave surface articulates with the Os calcis. The anterior surface of the body is continued into the neck, and that into the head; the former is covered with cartilage on the inferior surface for articulation with the sustentaculum of the Os calcis, the latter covered with cartilage for articulation with the scaphoid bone.

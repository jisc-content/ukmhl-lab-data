Cranial Nerves 133 V. N. TRIGEM. RADIX MOTOR.v / GANGL. SPHENO- PALAT. GAMGL. OTICUIV1. PLEX. SYMPATH. W. PTERYG. INT.' 477. The Otic Gang-lion. The supramaxillary ganglion, Ganglion swpramaxittare (Bochdalekii), is illustrated in Fig. 472; it is doubtful whether this really is a ganglion. The otic ganglion, Ganglion oticum (Arnoldi), lies below the Foramen ovale on the inner surface of the inferior maxillary nerve, con- nected with the nerve by a few filaments; it is pierced by the internal pterygoid nerve and its branch, which passes to the M. tensor palati mollis. Its branches are: a) Nerve to the tensor tympani, N. ad tensorem tympani; b) Small superficial petrosal nerve, N. petrosus super- ficialis minor; this nerve runs through a small canal in the great wing of the sphenoid bone, and with the great superficial petrosal nerve to the genu of the N. facialis, where it gives off a twig to the geniculate ganglion, and sends a second down to the tympanic cavity; this latter connects it with the N. Jaeobsonii (see Fig. 482) ; c) A small branch to the N. ad tensorem veli palatini; d) A small twig to the auricular branch of the auriculotem- poral nerve; e) A small branch from the Plexus sympathicus of the middle meningeal artery. The submaxillary or lingual ganglion, Ganglion sub- maxillare s. Unguale (see Fig. 474), is placed above the deep portion of the submaxillary gland, near the lingual nerve, with which it is con- nected by several filaments. Its branches supply the submaxillar}' gland, and accompany the lingual nerve to the mucous membrane of the tongue. 18*

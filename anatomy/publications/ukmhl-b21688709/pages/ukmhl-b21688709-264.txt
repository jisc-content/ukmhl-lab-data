The spiral canjil is divided by the bony spiral lamina, Lamina spiralis ossea, which projects into it from the modiolus, into two passages; of these, the lower, Scala tympani, communicates with the tymjianum by means of the Fenestra rotunda, while the u p p e r, Scala vestibuU, opens into the Heccssus licmispliaericus vestibuU (Fig. 320). In the Scala tympani, behind the Fenestra rotunda, is the orifice of a small canal, the Aquacductus ad cocMcam. The osseous spiral lamina ends at the last half turn in a hook- like process, Hamulus, turned towards the Scyphus (Fig. 320); it reaches only about half way towards the outer wall of the spiral canal; the two Scalac are closed by means of a membrane, the Lamina spiralis mcmbranacca. Between the two layers of this membrane is a canal, the Scala media s. canalis cochleae; upon that layer which lies in the plane of the osseous sj^iral lamina, usually called the Membrana basi/aris, the Organ of Corti lies. The Lamina spiralis mcmbranacca reaches in the cupola of the cochlea beyond the Hamulus and surrounds an opening, Helicotrema Brescheti, by means of which Scala vestibuU and Scala tympani communicate with each other.

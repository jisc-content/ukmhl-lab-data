128 Cranial Nerves. 472, The Second Division (Ramus supramaxillarisj of the Trigeminal Nerve. The II. superior maxillary branch, also sensory, leaves the skull through the Foramen rotunclum of the sphenoid bone, crosses the spheno-maxillary fossa and gives off the following branches: a) The orbital nerve, also called Nervus zijgomaticus s. sub- cutaneus malae, which enters the orbit by the spheno-maxillary fissure and divides into two branches: the temporal, Ramus temporalis; this receives a branch of communication from the lachrymal, and passing through the Canalis zijgomaticus temporalis enters the temporal fossa; at the anterior border of the temporal muscle it pierces the temporal fascia, and is distributed to the skin of the temple and side of the forehead; and the malar, Ramus malaris, which passes through the Canalis zijgomaticus facialis to the skin of the cheek; both communicate with the N. facialis. b) The superior dent a 1 or alveolar nerve, N. alueolaris superior. At the Tuber maxillare it divides into two branches, the first of which pierces the M. buccinator to be distributed to the mucous mem- brane of the mouth; the second passes through a Foramen maxillare superius into the upper dental canal, and runs forwards as posterior superior dental nerve to supply the mucous membrane of the antrum of Highmore and the pulp of the molar teeth. Finally it commu- nicates with the anterior superior dental nerve. c) The pterygo- or sp he no-palatine nerves, short nerves passing to the pterygo- or spheno-palatine ganglion. d) The infraorbital, Nervus infraorbitalis, is the direct con- tinuation of the superior maxillary nerve; it passes through the infra- orbital canal to the face and forms the Pes anserinus minor, whose twigs supply the skin of the lower eyelid, the cheek, nose and upper lip, and inosculate freely with the N facialis. One branch, the anterior superior dental nerve, forms the Ansa supramaxillaris and the Plexus dentalis.

181 Heart. 523. The Opening of the Coronary Vein into the Right Auricle. View from behind. After a dried specimen, natural size. In the right auricle there is also the coronary valve or Valvula Thebesii, a semicircular fold of the lining membrane of the auricle, protecting the orifice of the coronary sinus. The Foramina Thebcsii are numerous minute apertures, the mouths of small veins, which open on various parts of the inner surface of the auricle. The Eustachian valve is a crescentic fold of the lining membrane, which is an important structure in the foetal heart, serving the purpose of directing the stream of blood from the inferior Vena cava through the Foramen ovale into the left auricle. Its convex margin is attached to the wall of the Vena cava, its free concave margin terminates in two cornua, of which the left is attached to the anterior edge of the Anaulus ovalis. The Tuberculum Loweri is not visible in the hearts of adults; it is a small projection on the right wall of the auricle between the two Venae cavae. Both the coronary valve and the Eustachian valve may be found fenestrated. 24*

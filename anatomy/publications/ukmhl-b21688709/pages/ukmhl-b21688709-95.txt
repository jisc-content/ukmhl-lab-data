67 Bones of the Trunk 87. The Sternum in Articulation with the Costal Cartilages. The Sternum is in articulation at its lateral borders with seven costal cartilages. Only the first costal cartilage is continuous with the Sternum; the others are articulated with the Sternum in synovial cavities; the articular facets become shallower and shallower from the second to the seventh costal cartilage, and the seventh is placed in a very small concavity at the point of union of the Gladiolus and xiphoid appendix. The ribs whose cartilages articulate with the Sternum are called true, Cosfae verae; those ribs whose cartilages articulate with each other, or those which end free, without any articulation are called false, Costac spuriae. True ribs are the upper seven pairs; false ribs the lower five pairs. 9*

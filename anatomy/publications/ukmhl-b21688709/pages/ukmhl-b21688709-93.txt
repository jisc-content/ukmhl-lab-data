84. The Vertebral Column, Columna vertebralis, side view. The vertebral column presents the fol- lowing curves: in the cervical portion a tolerably marked convexity anteriorly; in the dorsal region a well marked convexity posteriorly; in the lumbar region a well marked convexity anteriorly, and in the sacral and coccygeal portions a convexity posteriorly. The most marked, anterior convex curve, is at the place where the lumbar portion of the vertebral column joins with the sacrum, where the last lumbar vertebra forms the promontory, Promontorium.

Spinal Nerves. 153 407. The Nerves at tlie Palmar Side of the Hand. 6. Ulnar nerve, jV. ulnaris, arises from the inner cord of the brachial plexus, lies at first to the inner side of the axillary artery and vein, pierces the internal intermuscular septum, passes down between the inner condyle of the humerus and olecranon, then between the two heads of the M. flexor carpi ulnaris, runs between it and 21. flexor digitorum profundus, and passes on the inner side of the ulnar artery to the wrist. It supplies the 21. flexor carpi ulnaris and inner half of the 21. flexor profundus digitorum and with a cutaneous branch, the ulnar side of the forearm. Above the wrist it divides into a dorsal and palmar branch, JR. dorsalis and R. volaris. The dorsal branch passes to the back of the hand, pierces the fascia and divides into five digital branches, Nervi digitorum dorsales, which supply both sides of the little and ring fingers and the ulnar side of the middle finger, down to the second phalanges. The palmar branch passes by the side of the pisiform bone above the annular ligament into the palm of the hand and divides into a superficial and a deep branch, R. superficialis and B. profundus. The former sends branches to the ulnar side of the little finger, and adjoining sides of the little and ring fingers; the latter supplies the muscles of the little finger, the 2121. inlerossei, the 21. lum- bricalis IV, Adductor pollicis and inner head of the 21. flexor brevis pollicis.

Salivary Glands. 13 339. The Salivary Grands, Glandulae salivates. On each side there are three salivary glands, namely: The parotid gland, Glandula parotis, lying in front of and below the ear, fills out the angle between the ramus of the lower jaw, the mastoid process and the external auditory meatus, and extends over the anterior surface of the Masseter muscle. Its chief excretory duct, Stenson's duct, Ductus Stenonianus, runs forwards parallel to the zygomatic arch, pierces the buccinator muscle, and opens on the inner surface of the cheek, opposite the first or second upper molar tooth. Precpxently an iso- lated small Parotis accessoria lies upon Stenson's duct. The submaxillary gland, Glanclula submaxillar is, lies partly beneath the mylo-hyoid muscle in the triangular space between the lower border of the inferior maxilla and the digastric muscle (M. biventer maxillae). Its excretory duct, Wharton's duct, Ductus Wliartonianus, opens at the side of the Fraenulum linguae on the summit of a small papilla, Caruncula sublingualis.

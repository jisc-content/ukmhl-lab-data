222 Organ of Vision. 300. Horizontal Section through both Eyeballs. After Ferdinand Arlt sen. The eyeball, Bulbus oculi, consists of three concentric coats; these coats are: a) the white sclerotic coat, Sclerotica s. Sclera, and the transparent Cornea; b) the choroid, Chorioidea, and the Iris; c) the Retina. The cavity of the eyeball is filled out by the aqueous h u m o r, Humor aqueus, the crystaline lens, Lens crystallina, and the vitreous body, Corpus vitreum. The sclerotica is an opaque, fibrous coat, whose most anterior segment is joined with the cornea, and whose posterior part is pierced for the passage of the optic nerve; this perforation is not in the axis of the eye, but about a line internal to it. At the point where the optic nerve passes through the sclerotica, this membrane forms a thin, cribriform lamina, Lamina cribrosa. The inner surface of the sclerotic is covered with delicate pigmented bundles of connective tissue, the Lamina fusca. The cornea projects forwards beyond the sclerotic; it is nearly circular, but a little broader in the transverse direction; the anterior surface is encroached upon by the sclerotic. Near the junction of the sclerotic and cornea is a venous, cavernous sinus, the canal of Schlemm (see Fig. 302, 303). The substance of the cornea consists of transparent connective tissue bundles, which cross one another at right angles in the alternate layers; the epithelium which covers the front of the cornea, con- sists of several layers of epithelial cells; beneath this is the structure- less anterior elastic lamina of Bowman; the posterior surface consists of a single layer of epithelial cells, above which is the Membrana Dcscemctii,

Cerebrum. 100 440. Horizontal Section of the Cerebrum, on a level with the Corpus cattosum. 2/3 natural size. The examination of the cerebrum is made in the following manner: The skull-cap is removed after a circular incision has been made with the saw, between the superciliary ridges and frontal eminences and above the external occipital protuberance. The Dura mater is cut open lengthwise on both sides of the longitudinal sinuses, and from the middle of these sections, a transverse cut is made; it is then folded back. The Falx cerebri is to be separated at the Crista gatti and laid back, and the veins opening into the longitudinal sinus must be divided. In this manner both hemispheres of the cerebrum and the great longi- tudinal fissure are brought into view. â€” The two hemispheres can be removed by horizontal sections down to the upper surface of the Corpus cattosum.

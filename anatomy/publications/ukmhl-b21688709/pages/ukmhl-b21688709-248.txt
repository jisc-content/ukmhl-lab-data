Organ of Vision. 220 297. The Lachrymal Apparatus. In each orbit are two compound racemose lachrymal glands, Glandulae lacrymales, not entirely distinct from each other; the larger, Glandula innominata Galeni, lies in the lachrymal fossa of the external angular process of the frontal bone; the smaller, Glandula lacrymalis accessoria Monroi, in front of and below it. The ten fine excretory ducts open at the Fornix conjunctivae. The tears, which, in the fornices are conveyed inwards, collect in the sinus between Plica semilunaris and Caruncula lacrymalis, in the Lacus lacrymarurn; from here they find their way into the Puncta lacry- malia, the minute orifices of the lachrymal canals; then into the Canaliculi lacrymales; thence into the lachrymal sac, Saccns lacrymalis s. Dacryocystis, which is lodged in a deep groove formed by the lachrymal and superior maxillary bones. The lachrymal sac leads into the membranous nasal d u c t, Ductus naso-lachrymalis, which opens into the inferior meatus, at the lateral wall of the nasal cavity, covered by the inferior turbinated bone (see Fig. 291). In the orbit are seven muscles; six move the eyeball, one the upper eyelid. M. levator palpcbrae svperioris arises from the upper surface of the sheath of the optic nerve, and is inserted below the upper border of the orbit into the superior tarsal cartilage.

Teeth. 10 335. The Right Permanent Teeth, Denies permanentes. Each jaw has sixteen permanent teeth, namely: Four incisor teeth, Dentes incisivi, with chisel-shaped crowns and single conical roots. Two canine teeth, Denies angulares s. canini, with conical crowns, tapering to a blunted point or cusp (on the inner side of these are two facets) and single conical roots. Four bicuspid teeth, Dentes buccales; the crown is compressed antero-posteriorly, and surmounted by two pointed tubercles, an external and an internal; the roots bifid or single, compressed, and deeply grooved. Six molar teeth, Dentes molares; the grinding surfaces surmoun- ted by four or five tubercles; in the upper jaw the root consists of three fangs, of which two are external, and one internal; in the lower jaw it has two fangs, one placed in front, the other behind, each of which is grooved. The last molar or wisdom tooth, Dens serotinus, Dens sapientiae (so called on account of its late appearance, usually between 20 and 25 years), has a smaller crown, shorter and more converging- roots, which may also blend and form a single fang. The periods of eruption of the temporary and permanent teeth are evident from Fig. 338 a and 338b.

The parenchyma of the lung is composed of lobules, Lobuli s. Insulae pulmoncdes, which are quite distinct from each other. Each lobule is com- posed of one of the ramifications of the bronchial tube and its terminal air-cells, and of the ramifications of the pulmonary and bronchial vessels, lymphatics and nerves. The walls of each lobular bronchial tube are closely covered by numerous saccular dilatations, the air - c el 1 s, Cdlulae pulmonales. The air-cells are surrounded by the capillary network, placed between the pulmonary artery and vein; the artery conveys the venous blood to the lungs, the vein returns the purefied blood to the heart. In purely anatomical relation with the thoracic viscera are: The thyroid gland, Glandula thjreoidea; it is situated at the upper part of the trachea, and consists of two lateral lobes, Cornua laterdMa, connected together by a narrow transverse portion, the isthmus ; occasionally a third lobe, Cornu medium, arises from the isthmus. The glandular sub- stance consists of round vesicles, which are closed cavities. The thymus gland is developed only in the foetus and up t<> the second year of life, when it ceases to grow and gradually dwindles, until at puberty it has almost disappeared. It lies partly in the thorax and partly in the lower region of the neck, and is composed of two lateral lobes, which become elongated inferiorly into two lateral cornua. Its' structure is analogous to the lymphatic glands.

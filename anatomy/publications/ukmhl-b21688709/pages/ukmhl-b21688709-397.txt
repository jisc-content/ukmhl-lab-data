129 Cranial Nerves. 473. The Third Division (Ramus inframaxillarisj of the Trigeminal Nerve. The III. inferior maxillary branch, both sensory and motor, leaves the skull through the Foramen ovale of the sphenoid bone and divides immediately after, into two groups. The first, chiefly motor group divides into the following branches : a) The masseteric, Nervus massetericus, passes outwards through the sigmoid notch of the lower jaw, enters the masseter and supplies it and the articulation of the jaw; b) The deep temporal, Nervi temporalis profundi, to the M. temporalis; c) The buccal or Nervus buccinatorius, to the M. buccinator ; d) The two pterygoid, Nervi ptcryrjoidci, an internal and an external for the two MM. pterygoidei. The second, chiefly sensory group, gives off thefollowingbranches: a) The auriculo-temporal, N. auriculo-temporalis s. temporalis super- ficial is; this arises by two roots, between which the middle meningeal artery (Art. mcningea media) (see Fig. 477) passes, and divides behind the condyle of the lower jaw into two branches, the posterior for the M. attrahens auriculae, the skin of the auricle and partly the external auditory meatus, and the anterior for the integument of the temporal region.

Second Layer: M. subclavius arises from the under surface of the clavicle, and is inserted into the upper border of the first costal cartilage. (Depresses the clavicle and acts as support to the sterno-clavicular articulation.) M. pectoralis minor arises by three or four tendinous slips from the outer surface of the second to the fifth ribs, being inserted into the coracoid process of the scapula. (Depresses the shoulder, elevates the ribs.) M. serratus anticus major s. scrratus magnus arises by eight or nine fleshy digitations from the outer surface of the eight or nine upper ribs, and is inserted into the inner border of the scapula (see Fig. 223).

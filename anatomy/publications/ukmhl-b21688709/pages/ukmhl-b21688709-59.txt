31 Bones of the Face. 38. The Vomer, Os vomeris. The vomer serves for the formation of the inferior part of the bony Septum narium. The superior border is separated, forming 2 alae, the Alae vomeris, between which the rostrum of the sphenoid is received. The inferior border touches the Crista nasalis, formed by both superior maxillary and both palate bones. The anterior longest border articulates at its upper portion with the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone, at its lower with the quadrangular cartilage of the septum, Septum cartilagineum. The posterior shortest border is free and forms the septum of the posterior nares, which separates these from each other, forming the two choanae. The vomer articulates with 6 bones: 2 of the cranium, the sphenoid and ethmoid bones, and 4 of the face, the 2 superior maxillary and the 2 palate hones; finally with the quadrangular cartilage of the septum, Cartilago quadrangu- laris s. Septum cartilagineum.

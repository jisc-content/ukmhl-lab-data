Heitzmann, Atlas. II. 33 w41IBBi N.TIBIALIS Veins. 251 C02. The Superficial Veins of the Lower Extremity. The veins of the lower extremity are superficial and deep. The deep accompany the arteries; those above the knee are usually single, those below, double. The external iliac or crural vein lies along the inner side of the external iliac artery; the femoral vein accompanies the femoral artery through the upper two thirds of the thigh; in the lower part of its course it lies external to the artery, higher up, it is behind it. The popliteal vein is formed by the junction of the venae comities of the anterior and posterior tibial vessels; in the lower part of its course it lies internal to the artery, but above the knee-joint is close to its outer side. The superficial veins arc formed from an arch, the Rete venosum pedis dorsale, and are the following: a) The internal or long saphenous vein, principally from the inner portion of the Retc dorsale, ascends in front of the internal malleolus to the leg and behind the internal condyle of the femur to the thigh. It passes through the .saphenous opening in the Fascia lata (Fovea oralis) and terminates in the femoral vein. In it the superficial veins of the inner and partly of the posterior sides of the lower extremity empty, also the exter- nal pudic, superficial epigastric and inguinal veins. Sometimes it is double throughout its entire course. b) The external (posterior) or short saphenous vein ascends from the outer border of the foot behind the external malleolus close to the Tench Achilles, then between both heads of the M. gastro- cnemius to the popliteal space, where it pierces the popliteal fascia and opens into the popliteal vein.

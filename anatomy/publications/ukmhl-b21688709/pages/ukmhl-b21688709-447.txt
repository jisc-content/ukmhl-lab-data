Heart. 179 521. The Right Heart, laid open. The right auriculo-ventricular orifice is guarded by the tricus- pid valve, Talvula tricuspidalis; the left by the mitral or b i c u s- pid valve, Yalvula hicuspidalis. One- set of the Cohimnae cameae are the MuscuM papillaris, which are connected at their base with the ven- tricular wall, and by the other end are attached to small tendinous c o r d s, Chordae tcndineac, through which they are connected with the segments of the auriculo-ventricular valve. The semilunar valves, Valvulae semilunares, three in number on each side, guard the orifices of the aorta and pulmonary artery; they are attached by their convex margins, to the wall of each artery, at its junction with the ventricle, the straight border being free. The free margin of each presents at its middle, a small projecting fibro- cartilaginous nodule, Kodidus s. Corpus Arantii, which is especially marked at the semilunar valve of the aorta. The internal surfaces of all the cavities of the heart are lined by the Endocardium, which is a thin, connective tissue membrane covered with endothelium. Heitzmanu, Atlas. II. 24

Small Intestine. 28 357a. Segment of the In- 357b. Segment of tlie In- ner Surface of the Small ner Surface of the Small Intestine, natural size. Intestine, somewhat magnified. In the small intestine there are four kinds of glands: a) The crypts of Li e b erkiih n are minute tubular depressions, scattered between the villi. b) B runner's glands are acinous glands found only in the duodenum, especially numerous at its commencement. c) The solitary follicles are scattered throughout the mucous membrane of the small intestine; they are of different size and similar in structure to the lymphatic glands. d) The agminate d glands or glands of Peyer are aggre- gations of solitary glands, usually found only in the ileum; they are placed lengthwise in the intestine, at that part of the tube most distant from the mesentery. The large intestine commences at the coecum, to the lower part of which the vermiform appendix, Processus vermicular is, from 2 â€” 3 inches in length, is attached; the portion succeeding the coecum is the colon, divided into an ascending, Colon ascendens, transverse, Colon transversum, descending, Colon descendens, and sigmoid flexure, Flexura slgmoidca s. S romanum; the last portion is the rectum, Intestinum rectum. which ends at the anus. Only the coecum with the vermiform appen- dix, transverse colon and sigmoid flexure are completely invested by peritoneum, which is more or less wanting on the posterior surface of the other parts of the large intestine.

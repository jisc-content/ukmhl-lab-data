87 Fascia pelvis. 429. The Ligaments of the Visceral Layer of the Fascia pelvis. View of the Symphisis from behind, the Bladder being turned back. The fasciae of the perinaeum are: a) Fascia perinei supcrficialis; b) Fascia perinei profunda; c) Fascia pelvis. â€” The pelvic fascia consists of two parts, which are known as the obturator fascia and the recto-vesical fascia; the latter forms the visceral layer of the pelvic fascia. The obturator fascia covers the inner surface of the M. obturator interims; it is attached above to the iliac portion of the ilio-pectineal line; in front, to the body of the pubis along an oblique line extending from the obturator foramen to below the symphisis; behind, to the great sciatic notch, and below it joins the falciform process of the great sacro-sciatic ligament, by means of which it is connected to the rami of the ischium and pubes. At the upper end of the obturator foramen the fascia joins the upper edge of the obturator membrane, for- ming an arch over the border of the muscle, and bounding below the short canal by which the obturator vessels and nerves issue.

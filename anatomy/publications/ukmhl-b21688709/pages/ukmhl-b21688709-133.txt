105 Articulations of the Hand. 146. The Strengthening Ligaments on the Palmar Side of the Right Wrist The Ligamentum accessorium rectum et obliquum (anterior ligament), attached above to the radius and interarticular cartilage and below to the scaphoid, semilunar and cuneiform bones, serves as strengthening ligament to the fibrous capsule of the wrist joint on the palmar side. Between the Eminentiae carpi radiales and ulnares the strong Ligamentum carpi transversvm, (annular ligament), is attached; beneath it the flexor ten- dons of the fingers pass. On the palmar side also, short tense ligaments strengthen the inter- carpal and carpo-metacarpal articulations. Heitzmann, Atlas. I.

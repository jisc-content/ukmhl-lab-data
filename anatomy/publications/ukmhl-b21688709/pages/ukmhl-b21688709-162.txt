134 Bones of the Lower Extremity, 185. The Right Os calcis, s. Calcaneus, from above. The caleaueum, situated below the astragalus, is elongated posteriorly, forming the Calx, which ends in the tuberosity, Tuberositas calcanei. On the superior surface is the articular facet covered with cartilage, for articulation with the body of "the astragalus; in front of it is the Sulcus calcanei, which, with the similar Sulcus tali forms the Sinus tarsi. Internally to the articular facet a process, the Sustentaculum, covered with cartilage on its upper surface, projects; a second similar facet, is sometimes found at the inner anterior angle of the calcaneum. The anterior articular facet serves for articulation with the cuboid bone, articulates therefore with two bones: the astragalus and cuboid. 186. The Right Scaphoid Bone, Os scaphoideum sea naviculare, from above. The posterior surface of the scaphoid bone serves for articulation with the head of the astragalus; the anterior surface is divided into three facets for articulation with the three cuneiform bones; the internal border presents the tuberosity, Tuberositas ossis navicularis. The scaphoid bone articulates with four bones: the astragalus and the three cuneiform, sometimes also with the cuboid.

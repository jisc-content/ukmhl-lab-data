114 Cerebellum. fentr. M. 455. The Third and Fourth Ventricles of the Brain the latter covered by the Anterior Medullary Velum. Natural size. Below the central lobes are found the two superior peduncles of the cerebellum which run upwards and forwards towards the base of the Corpora quadrigemina. The anterior medullary velum is stretched between the two peduncles; its upper surface is marked by four or five transverse, grey laminae, with intervening sulci, which together constitute the Lingida, connected posteriorly with the central lobe. A slightly ele- vated ridge, the Fraenulum veli medullaris, descends upon the anterior part of the velum, from the median raphe of the posterior Corpora quadri- gemina; on both sides of it may be seen the fibres of origin of the fourth nerve. Behind the Brachium posterius of the testes, at the side of the anterior end of the Processus cerebelli ad corpus quadrigerninum is found the fillet, Lemniscus s. Laqueus (see Fig. 45G)- Sections both of the vermiform process and of the hemispheres of the cerebellum present a beautifully foliated or arborescent appearance, the Arbor vitae vermis and Arbor vitae cerebelli. After removal of the vermiform process the upper (posterior) sur- face of the Medulla oblongata, which forms the floor of the fourth v e n- tricle, Vcntricidus quartus, is brought to view.

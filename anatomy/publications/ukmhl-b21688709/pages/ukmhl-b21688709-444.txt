518. The Heart and Large Vessels. View from before, */2 natural size. The heart, Cor, is a hollow, muscular organ of a conical form, which projects further into the left than into the right half of the chest, and lies between the concave surfaces of the lungs. It consists of a base, directed upwards, backwards and to the right, and of an apex, directed downwards, forwards and to the left; also of a convex anterior surface, a flattened posterior surface and two lateral bor- ders. Two longitudinal sulci, situated one on the anterior, the other on the posterior surface, divide the heart into a right and a left half; these sulci are continuous one with the other a little to the right of the apex; the anterior is nearer to the left and the posterior nearer to the right side of the heart. Both halves are again divided by a deep transverse groove, which is plainly visible only at the posterior surface of the heart.

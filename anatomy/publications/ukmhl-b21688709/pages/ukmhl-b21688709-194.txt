166 Diaphragm. 220. The Diaphragm, Diaphragma. Under Surface. The diaphragm consists of a muscular portion, Pars muscularis, and a tendinous portion, Pars tendinea. The Pars muscularis is divided into the Pars lumbalis, and the Pars costal is. The Pars lumbalis is formed by three pairs of crura. The inne r pair, Crura interna, arises from the anterior surface of the third and fourth lumber vertebrae; the crura cross once to form the aortic opening, Hiatus aorticus, then a second time, whereby the oesophageal opening, Foramen oesophagcum, is formed. The middle pair of crura arises from the lateral region of the second lumbar vertebra; the outer pair of crura from the lateral region and the transverse processes of the first lumbar vertebra. The Pars costalis arises from the six or seven lower ribs, the xiphoid appendix (see Fig. 216) and the Ligamenta arcuata Hallcri. The Pars muscularis is continued into the Pars tendinea seu Centrum tendineum (cen- tral or cordiform tendon), which is shaped somewhat like a trefoil leaf, and has in its right leaflet the quadrilateral Foramen venosum seu quadri- laterum (opening for the Vena cava).

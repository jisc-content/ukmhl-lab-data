Kidneys. 59 Bertini 396. Longitudinal Section through the Kidney. The renal artery enters the hilus dividing'into four or five branches, which, penetrating' the substance of the organ, pass into the cortical substance between the pyramids, and continue to divide and subdivide; these branches have a con- voluted arrangement and finally form the Glomeruli venules, which are surrounded by a capsule. A vein smaller than the artery emerges from the glomerulus, and divides into branches, from which a network of capillaries arises. The Tubuli uviniferi commence at the capsule of the glomerulus opposite the place where the artery enters and leaves; they are at first convoluted (Tubuli contorti I. ordinis), but approaching the medullary portion become more or less spiral (spiral tubule of Schachowa); they then enter the pyramids and form loops (looped tubule of Henle, Ansae Hcnlei), pass back into the cortical substance to again become convoluted (Tubuli contorti II, ordinis) and are connected with the straight or collecting tubules. These straight tubules, Tubuli recti s. Belliniani, enter the pyramids and are arranged in groups; the tubes open at the papillae by fine orifices, the Cvibrum benedictum; the separate bundles of each tube form the pyramids of Ferrein, these together form a Pyramis Malpighii (see Fig. 399). The vascular loops in the pyramids come from the capillaries of the cortical substance. The Calices renales minores receive the Papillae venules into their wide mouths and unite (2â€”3) to form the Culices renales majoves (infundibula); these again, by their junction form the Pelvis renulis, which lies in the hilus behind the renal artery and vein and becomes continuous with the ureter, which carries the urine into the bladder, 8*

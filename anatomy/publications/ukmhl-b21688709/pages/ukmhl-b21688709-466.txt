198 Carotis interna. 542. Course and Ramification of the Internal Carotid and the Vertebral Artery. The internal carotid artery, Carotis interna, which lies at first to the outer side of the external carotid, is separated from the latter by the MM. stylo- glossus and s'tylo-pharyngeus. It is remarkable for the number of curvatures that it presents; in its cervical portion it occasionally presents one or two flexures near the base of the skull, whilst through the rest of its extent it describes a double curvature which resembles the italic s placed horizontally. During its course in the carotid canal and cavernous sinus, it sends small branches to the mucous membrane of the tympanic cavity (JRamulus carotico-tympanicus), to the Gasserian ganglion, to the dura mater and to the Tentorium cerebelli.

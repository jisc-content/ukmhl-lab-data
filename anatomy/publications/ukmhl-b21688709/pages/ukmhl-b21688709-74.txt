Each true vertebra has a central opening (Foramen vertebrate) and an anterior and posterior semi-arch; the anterior semi-arch becomes the body of the vertebra, Corpus vertebrae; the posterior semi-arch or arch, Arcus vertebrae, has 7 processes: 3 muscular and 4 articular processes. Of the muscular processes there is one spinous process, Processus spinosus, and 2 transverse processes, Processus transversa. Of the articular processes 2 look upwards, Processus articulares ascendentes, and 2 downwards, Processus articulares descendentcs. The notches at the place where the arch and body touch, form with the neighbouring vertebrae the intervertebral foramina, Foramina intervcrtebralia.

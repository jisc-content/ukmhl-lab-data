The cavity behind the mouth, nose and larynx is called pharynx; below, it is continuous with the oesophagus. The anterior wall of the pharynx communicates with the nasal cavity by means of the two posterior nares, Choanae, with the mouth by means of the isthmus of the fauces and with the larynx by means of the Aditvs ad laryngcm. On each side of the pharynx, at the back part of the inferior meatus, is the opening for the Eustachian tube, Ostium pharyngeum Tubae Eustachii; it is four lines long, directed obliquely from within and above, externally and inferiorly, and has irregular borders; between this opening and the posterior wall of the pharynx, the mucous membrane is deepened, forming R o s e n m u 11 e r's f o s s a. By means of the soft palate, when it comes in contact with the posterior pharyngeal wall, the pharynx is divided into two cavities, the Cavum pliaryngo-nasalc and Cavum phaTyngo-laryngewm.

Arteria radialis et ulnaris. 211 557. The Superficial Palmar Arch. b) The ulnar artery, Art. ulnaris, runs along the ulnar border of the forearm, upon and to the side of the M. flexor profundus digitorum, between which and the M. flexor carpi ulnaris it passes to the wrist. It crosses the annular ligament on the radial side of the pisiform bone and passes into the palm of the hand where it divides into a superficial and a deep branch. The superficial branch forms, usually with the superficialis volae of the radial artery, the superficial palmar arch, Arcus volaris sublimis, the deep branch forms with the ter- mination of the radial artery the deep palmar arch, Arcus volaris profundus. The branches of the ulnar artery are: 1. The anterior ulnar recurrent, which passes back to the internal condyle of the humerus and anastomoses with Art. anastomotica magna ; 2. The posterior ulnar recurrent, the larger, which anasto- moses behind the internal condyle of the humerus with the inferior profunda artery; 3. Several muscular branches for the neighbouring muscles, one of which supplies the ulna by means of a nutrient artery. Heitzmann, Atlas. II. 28

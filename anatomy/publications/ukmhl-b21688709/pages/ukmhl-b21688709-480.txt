Arteria radkdis et ulnavis. 212 558. The Deep Palmar Arch. Further branches of the ulnar artery (see Fig. 555 and 556) are: 4. The common interosseous artery, Art. interossea antibracliii communis, which, soon after its origin, divides into the posterior or external and anterior or internal branch. The posterior interosseous artery passes through the interosseous membrane, sends the interosseous recurrent branch to the posterior region of the elbow, lies upon the MM. extensor ossis metacarpi, and extensor secundi internodii p>ollicis, gives off a number of muscular branches and finally anastomoses with the posterior carpal branch of the radial artery so as to form the posterior carpal arch, Mete carpi dorsale. The anterior interosseous artery passes down the forearm on the anterior surface of the interosseous membrane to the M. pronator qua- dratics, behind which it passes, gives off a branch to the Rcte carpi volarc, and, piercing the interosseous membrane as Art. p>erforans inferior, descends to the back of the wrist, where it joins the posterior carpal arch. 5. The last branch of the ulnar artery before it divides, is the posterior carpal, for the posterior carpal arch.

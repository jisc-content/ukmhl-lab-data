Lymphatics. 265 618. The Superficial Lymphatics of the Lower Extremity. The lymphatics of the lower extremity converge to the ingui- nal glands, which are partly superficial and partly deep, and form the inguinal plexus by a number of anastomoses. The former lie between Poupart's ligaments and the Fovea ovalis, the latter upon the vessels of the thigh. The lymphatics are the following: a) Lymphatics of the thigh. They pass partly above the Fascia lata, partly below it. The superficial ascend from the foot, pass with the great saphenous vein, partly also below the integument of the leg. The deep accompany the deep blood vessels and in the popli- teal space pass through 1 â€” 4 deep popliteal glands. b) The lymphatics of the hypogastric region pass down above Poupart's liga- ment, and enter the uppermost inguinal glands. c) The lymphatics of the external genitals pass from the penis or the clitoris to the adipose tissue of the Mom Veneris, from there to the superficial inguinal glands. The lymphatics of the scrotum and Labia majora pass transversely outwards to the inguinal glands. Fasa lymph, plant.

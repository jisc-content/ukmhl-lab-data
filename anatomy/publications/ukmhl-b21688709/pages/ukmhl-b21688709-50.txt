22 Bones of the Face. 24. Right Superior Maxilla r)~ Bone, Maxilla superior, from the inner side. The nasal surface of the body shows the large opening of the antrum of Highmore; in front of this a semi-canal, the lachrymal groove, Sulcus lacrymalis. The outer surface of the nasal process of the superior maxilla (Fig. 23) is divided into an anterior and a posterior portion, by an elon- gation of the Margo infraorbital is; the posterior portion forms the Fossa sacci lacrymalis, which is continued into the Sulcus lacrymalis. The inner sur- face of the nasal process is transversely cut by a rough crest, the superior turbinated crest or Crista cthmoidalis (not constant); a thumb's breadth below this the inferior turbinated crest or Crista turbinalis, passes transversely across the surface, from the lower end of the Sulcus lacrymalis; between both crests lies the middle meatus, Meatus narium medius. The zygomatic process (Fig. 23) is a rough triangular eminence and serves for articulation with the malar bone.

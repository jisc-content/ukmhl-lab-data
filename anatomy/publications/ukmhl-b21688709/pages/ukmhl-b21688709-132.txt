Articulations of the Hand. 104 145. The Strengthening Ligaments on the Dorsal Surface of the Right Wrist. The lax fibrous capsule of the wrist joint is strengthened on the dorsal side by the broad Ligamentum rhomboideum, (posterior ligament), which runs from the radius to the semilunar and cuneiform bones. Bet- ween the styloid process of the radius and the scaphoid bone the exter- nal lateral ligament, Ligammtum laterale radiate, is attached; between the styloid process of the ulna and cuneiform bone the internal lateral liga- ment, Ligammtum laterale ulnarc seu Funiculus Ugamentosus. The intercarpal and carpo-metacarpal articulations are strengthened by short, tense liga- ments. The base of the metacarpal bone of the thumb is articulated to the articular surface of the trapezium by means of a lax fibrous capsule.

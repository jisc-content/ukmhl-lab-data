Ligaments of the Spine. 62 SO. The Ligaments between the Atlas and Axis, superior view. By the Ligamentum transversum atlantis which arches across the odon- toid process (Dens) of the axis the opening of the atlas is divided into an anterior smaller and a posterior larger space; the former is for the odontoid process of the axis, the latter for the spinal cord. Between the anterior surface of the odontoid process and the articular facet of the anterior arch of the atlas, also between the posterior surface of the odontoid process and the Ligamentum transversum arching across it, are synovial capsules. SI. The Ligamentum sitspensorium dentis and the Liga- menta alaria, after opening of the anterior arch of the Atlas. The Ligamentum suspensorium dentis runs from the summit of the odon- toid process to the anterior border of the Foramen magnum; the Ligamenta alaria run from both sides of the summit of the odontoid process to the lateral bordeis of the Foramen magnum and to the inner surface of the condyloid processes.

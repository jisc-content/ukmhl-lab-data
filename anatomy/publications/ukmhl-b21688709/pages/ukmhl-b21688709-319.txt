51 Lungs. 387. The Thoracic Viscera of a Child. View from before. Natural size. (The thymus gland pushed somewhat upwards; the lungs turned aside.) The lungs, Pulmones, are placed one in each of the lateral cavities of the chest; the concave base rests upon the diaphragm, the concave inner surface is in part adapted to the convex pericardium, and the external surface, which is convex, corresponds to the form of the cavity of the chest. The right lung is broader and shorter than the left, and divided into three lohes, Lohi pulmonum; the left is smaller, narrower and longer than the right, and has only two lobes. The base is of semilunar form, the anterior border thin and sharp, the posterior border rounded and broad. At the inner surface is a fissure, the Hilus s. Porta pulmonis; here the bronchus and pulmonary artery enter the lung, and the two pulmonary veins have their exit from the lung. These structures, the bronchus, pulmonary artery and pulmonary veins, form together the root of the lung, Radix s. Peduncidus pulmonis. 7*

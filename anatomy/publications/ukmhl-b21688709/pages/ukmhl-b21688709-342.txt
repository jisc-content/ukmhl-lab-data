74 Female Organs of Generation. Sections of vessels 413. Vertical Section through au Ovary with large Corpus luttum. The ovaries, Ovar/'a, lie in the plane of the superior pelvic aperture, enveloped in the posterior layer of the broad ligament of the uterus; they are of an oval form; each has an outer obtuse extremity, and an inner end, connected to the uterus by the proper ligament of the ovary, Ligamentum ovariiproprium, an upper and a lower surface, and an anterior and posterior border. Before menstruation has begun the surface of the ovary is smooth and even, but in later years, after repeated menstruations, it becomes more uneven and is marked by jiits and scars. The ovaries are not completely invested by peritoneum, the anterior borders remaining free, and here the bloodvessels enter and leave â€” Hilus ovarii. The proper fibrous covering is called the Tunica propria s, albuginta, which is perforated by the bloodvessels at the hilus. The Stroma ovarii is abundantly supplied with bloodvessels and consists of spindle-shaped cells with a small amount of ordinary connective tissue; in the stroma are a great number of closely set vesicles of various sizes, the Graafian follicles. Each larger follicle is surrounded by a dense connective tissue covering, the Theca folliculi; then follows a structurless layer with pavement epithelium, the so called Membrana granulosa. The cavity contains a light yellow fluid, the Liquor folliculi. In one part of the Graafian follicle the epithelial cells are collected into a mass, the Discus oqphorus s. proligcrus, in the center of which the ovum is imbedded.
